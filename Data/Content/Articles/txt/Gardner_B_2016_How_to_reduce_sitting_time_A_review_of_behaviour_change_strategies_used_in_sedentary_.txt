Sedentary behaviour –i.e., low energy-expending waking behaviour while seated or
lying down –is a health risk factor, even when controlling for physical activity. This
review sought to describe the behaviour change strategies used within interventions
that have sought to reduce sedentary behaviour in adults. Studies were identi ﬁed
through existing literature reviews, a systematic database search, and hand-
searches of eligible papers. Interventions were categorised as ‘very promising ’,
‘quite promising ’,o r ‘non-promising ’according to observed behaviour changes.
Intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were compared across
promising and non-promising interventions. Twenty-six eligible studies reportedthirty-eight interventions, of which twenty (53%) were worksite-based. Fifteen
interventions (39%) were very promising, eight quite promising (21%), and
ﬁfteen non-promising (39%). Very or quite promising interventions tended to
have targeted sedentary behaviour instead of physical activity. Interventionsbased on environmental restructuring, persuasion, or education were mostpromising. Self-monitoring, problem solving, and restructuring the social or
physical environment were particularly promising behaviour change techniques.
Future sedentary reduction interventions might most fruitfully incorporateenvironmental modi ﬁcation and self-regulatory skills training. The evidence base
is, however, weakened by low-quality evaluation methods; more RCTs,employing no-treatment control groups, and collecting objective data are needed.

lying down (Sedentary Behaviour Research Network [SBRN], 2012). It is increasingly
recognised as a risk factor for mortality and morbidity, after controlling for moderate-
to-vigorous physical activity (Wilmot et al., 2012). Self-report data suggest the average
European adult spends 5 hours sitting per weekday (Bennie et al., 2013). Among UK
ofﬁce workers, the ﬁgure may be higher: using objective data, one study showed 5.3
hours of the working day to be spent sitting (Ryan, Grant, Dall, & Granat, 2011),
and another that workers spend 10.6 weekday hours sitting on average between
7 am and 11 pm (Smith et al., 2015). While those who spend more time in sedentary
behaviour tend to do less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (Mansoubi,
Pearson, Biddle, & Clemes, 2014), the potentially independent health impacts of
sedentary behaviour and physical activity mean that activity-promotion may fail tooffset the health impact of sedentary behaviour (Henson et al., 2013).
Sedentary behaviour reduction interventions have been conducted among children
for many years (Biddle, Gorely, & Stensel, 2004), but interventions among adults are
much more recent, and more are needed. Syntheses of previous intervention trials canprovide a valuable input into the design of new interventions, by revealing which
approaches, techniques, and assumptions show promise in reducing sedentary behav-
iour, and the strength of the evidence (Craig et al., 2008; Michie, Atkins, & West,
2014). To our knowledge, only four syntheses of sedentary behaviour reduction inter-
ventions have been undertaken to date (Chau et al., 2010; Owen et al., 2011; Prince,
Saunders, Gresty, & Reid, 2014; Shrestha, Ijaz, Kukkonen-Harjula, Kumar, &
Nwankwo, 2015), of which two focused on worksite-based interventions only (Chau
et al., 2010; Shrestha et al., 2015). Two of the four reviews reported meta-analyses
of intervention effects (Prince et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2015), and concluded
that, while the quality of included studies was at best moderate, interventions that
target sedentary behaviour have the potential to decrease it. Yet, effect sizes varied,
with intervention recipients in one study achieving a reduction of 176 min/day ofsedentary behaviour, and in another a decrease of only 52 min/day. No review to
date has focused on the discrete behaviour change techniques that may distinguish
more effective from less effective interventions.
Developing effective sedentary reduction interventions depends on understanding
both what works in changing sedentary behaviour and why. Recent advances in behav-ioural science permit the identi ﬁcation of intervention components that may explain
between-study variation in effectiveness (e.g., Michie & Prestwich, 2010; Michie
et al., 2013). A recent framework (the ‘Behaviour Change Wheel ’; Michie, van
Stralen, & West, 2011) proposes that interventions can play one or more of nine func-
tions in order to change behaviour; for example, interventions may seek to educate
the target population of the need for change, persuade them by inducing positive or
negative emotions around the behaviour, or train them in the skills needed to achieve
change. A taxonomy is available which describes 93 discrete behaviour change tech-
niques that may be used in interventionswithin any behavioural domain (e.g., providing
information on health consequences, setting goals, restructuring the physical environ-ment; Michie et al., 2011). Intervention functions represent ‘broad categories of
means by which an intervention can change behaviour ’(Michie, Atkins, & West,
2014,
p. 109), and behaviour change techniques represent the observable and irreducible
intervention components that serve to perform one or more functions (Michie & West,
2013). Coding for intervention functions and behaviour change techniques in published
intervention descriptions can provide a useful summary of the broad strategies and90 B. Gardner et al.
speci ﬁc techniques that have previously been employed, and comparing these com-
ponents across effective and ineffective interventions can point towards the possible
‘active ingredients’ of interventions (Gardner, Whittington, McAteer, Eccles, &
Michie, 2010; Gilinsky et al., 2015; Martin, Chater, & Lorencatto, 2013; Michie,
Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009). Interventions based on theory
can be more effective (Ivers et al., 2012; but see Gourlan et al., 2014), and where
theory use is scant, identifying the intervention functions and behaviour change tech-
niques used can reveal the implicit theoretical assumptions underpinning interventions
(Gardner et al., 2010). For example, providing information on the health impact of
sitting assumes sedentary behaviour is driven by a lack of knowledge, and that increas-
ing knowledge will change behaviour (Abraham & Michie, 2008). Where techniques are
found to be associated with promising interventions, this can inform hypothesising
around the possible psychological or other pathways through which sedentary behav-
iour might best be reduced. Conversely, identifying strategies associatedwith less prom-
ising interventions can ensure that intervention designers do not devote time andresources to developing unhelpful strategies.
The aim of this review was to consider how sedentary behaviour in adults might best
be reduced, by describing the behaviour change strategies used in sedentary behaviourreduction intervention evaluations. Our review goes beyond previous evidence syntheses
in this ﬁeld by exploring intervention components that may act as potential sources of
variation in effects. Given the relative infancy of the sedentary behaviour change ﬁeld,
our review does not aim to provide de ﬁnitive conclusions regarding the most effective
intervention components; rather, it is designed to offer input into the development of
future sedentary reduction interventions, by highlighting which behaviour change strat-egies have shown promise in previous studies (e.g., Craig et al., 2008;M i c h i e ,A t k i n s ,&
West, 2014). We treated interventions as ‘promising ’where sedentary behaviour was
observed to have reduced on at least one measure. We coded for intervention character-istics, to identify which functions and techniques have been used to reduce sedentary be-
haviour and which were more associated with potential for achieving reduction in
sedentary behaviour, and study-level methodological characteristics for descriptive pur-poses only. We included any intervention for which evidence was available regarding
extent of change in sedentary behaviour, regardless of whether sedentary behaviour
change was an explicit target. The protocol for this review is not publicly available,nor was the review registered on the PROSPERO database. Nonetheless, relevant
PRISMA systematic review guidelines were followed (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, &
Altman, 2009). A completed PRISMA checklist is available as supplemental material.
Methods
Selecting papers for reviewEligibility criteria
Studies were included where they met the following criteria (Schardt, Adams, Owens,
Keitz, & Fontelo, 2007). The study population was adults aged 18 or over, recruited
from the general population. Clinical populations –i.e., participants recruited on
the basis of their membership of a clinical group, such as having diabetes –were
excluded. Overweight and obese participants were not considered a clinicalpopulation.Health Psychology Review 91
The eligibility of interventions was dependent on outcomes , such that any behaviour
change intervention was eligible where primary quantitative data were available per-
taining to pre-post changes in at least one indicator of sedentary behaviour amongthose receiving the intervention. Interventions that did not explicitly target sedentary
behaviour were thus included where pre- and post-intervention sedentary behaviour
data were available. Objective and self-report data were entered into the review. Objec-tive data were taken as indicative of sedentary behaviour only where based on direct
observation, or a combined accelerometer –inclinometer device sensitive to both
activity and posture, so as to reliably differentiate between sitting or lying down and
standing (Grant, Ryan, Tigbe, & Granat, 2006). Sedentary behaviour objectively
measured in this way was de ﬁned as time spent in minimal energy expenditure, in a
seated or reclined position (SBRN, 2012). Studies in which sedentary behaviour was
objectively estimated only as low physical activity (e.g., low step count) were excluded
(e.g., Andersen, Høstmark, Holme, & Anderssen, 2013; Gardiner, Eakin, Healy, &
Owen, 2011; Gilson, Suppini, Ryde, Brown, & Brown, 2012), as this depicts inactivity,
not sedentary behaviour, identi ﬁcation of which depends on postural allocation
methods. The only eligible self-report sedentary behaviour indices were sitting time
(total waking sitting or domain-speci ﬁc, e.g., worksite sitting), time spent lying down
while awake, or a combination thereof, though the latter two indices were not found
in any study. While sedentary behaviour has previously been operationalised as time
spent in activities typically done while seated (e.g., TV viewing, computer use; Gardiner,Clark, et al., 2011; Rhodes, Mark, & Temmel, 2012), studies in which only these beha-
viours were measured were excluded, because they may be performed while active andso do not reliably denote true sedentary behaviour (e.g., Rovniak et al., 2014). The eli-
gible type of study was peer-reviewed, and published in full text in English. No eligibility
criteria were based on comparisons ortype of question asked .
Search procedure
Three search strategies were used. First, potentially eligible references were identi ﬁed
from two existing reviews of sedentary behaviour reduction interventions (Chau et al.,
2010; Owen et al., 2011). (Two more recent reviews were published after our search
was completed [Prince et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2015].) Second, an electronic search
of seven databases (CINAHL Plus, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, Psy-cArticles Full Text, PsycInfo, SPORTDiscus with Full Text) was undertaken on 25 April2014. Search ﬁlters were applied to each database to specify: interventions to reduce
sedentary behaviour or increase physical activity; intervention evaluation designs; andexclusion of non-adult and clinical samples. No date limits were set. Example searchterms are provided in Table A1 in Supplemental material. Third, reference lists of eligible
records thus identi ﬁed were hand-searched for additional papers.
Search results and screening
Searches and screening were undertaken by a health psychologist fully trained in data-
base searching and experienced in systematic reviewing (BG). To estimate screening
reliability, a physical activity epidemiologist (LS) independently screened the titles
and abstracts of 20% of all records returned by the search procedure, and full texts
of 20% of records selected for full-text assessment by the ﬁrst coder. Title and abstract92 B. Gardner et al.
agreement, judged according to whether the selected papers incorporated those
selected by the ﬁrst coder for inclusion, was 100%, and full-text agreement 98%. Dis-
agreement on one full-text record (2%) was resolved through discussion.
Eight papers were identi ﬁed from previous reviews (see Figure 1 ). Database
searches returned 1194 unique records, of which 20 were eligible, from the reference
lists of which a further 6 eligible papers were identi ﬁed. The ﬁnal dataset comprised
26 papers.
Additional materials
Corresponding authors were emailed and asked to provide additional information for
coding. Twenty-three authors were approached (including three corresponding formultiple papers), for two (9%) of whom email addresses were no longer functioning
and could not be traced online. Thirteen (57%) did not respond. Of eight authors
(35%) who did respond, three (13% of all authors) stated that no more informationwas available, and ﬁve (22%) sent additional material.
Data extraction
Alongside information from the 26 eligible papers, additional detail of the intervention
treatment(s) was coded from: records in open-access trial registries for seven papersthat reported a trial registration reference code; published supplementary materials
(two papers); one or more linked publications cited in the included paper (ﬁ ve
papers); and published and unpublished material provided by authors (four and two
papers, respectively).
Figure 1. Search strategy and screening procedure.Health Psychology Review 93
At least 32 data segments were extracted from all material relevant to each paper,
with an additional 14 segments extracted for each additional intervention or control
group. A data extraction form was developed, applied and iteratively re ﬁned by a
health psychologist (BG) to ensure adequate data capture. A second health psycholo-
gist (FL) independently coded all available material for seven (27%) randomly selected
papers, using the ﬁnal data extraction form (Version 9). Inter-coder agreement was
assessed using percentage agreement and kappa (ĸ ). Kappa values were interpreted
according to Landis and Koch’ s(1977) criteria, whereby ĸ> 0 < .20 denoted slight,
ĸ≥.20 < .40 fair, ĸ≥.40 < .60 moderate, ĸ≥.60 < .80 substantial, and ĸ≥.80 almost
perfect agreement. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
Study characteristics
Methodological characteristics extracted included country, setting, study design, length of
follow-up(s), the number of arms and interventions, theory basis, and whether the extent
of prior sedentary behaviour was an eligibility criterion. We coded treatments as ‘inter-
ventions ’where they involved any attempt to modify any behaviour (physical activity,
sedentary behaviour, other), to allow for the possibility that sedentary behaviour maychange even where not explicitly targeted. Groups described as ‘control groups ’in pub-
lished paperswere therefore coded as intervention groupswhere they received abehaviour
change treatment. Advice to maintain current behaviour was not deemed a behaviour
change treatment. An extensive coding frame was used to code the theory basis of inter-
ventions (Michie & Prestwich, 2010), but data could only be consistently extracted for
only one item, relating to whether a named theory of behaviour or behaviour change
was mentioned in the Abstract, Introduction or Method section. Prior sedentary behav-
iour was coded as an eligibility criterion where explicitly stated as such, andwhere partici-pantswere selected on the basis ofobserved sedentary behaviour levels, or employment in
a sedentary occupation (e.g., seated deskwork). Inter-rater reliability for all methodologi-
cal characteristics was perfect (100%; ĸ=1 ) .
Sample characteristics extracted were participant description (e.g., employees,
parents), and, for each group, baseline and follow-up sample size, and demographics(age, gender). Inter-rater reliability was perfect (100% agreement; ĸ= 1).
Study quality was coded using an adaptation of the quality assessment tool used in
Chau et al ’s(2010) review of sedentary reduction interventions, which itself was
adapted from a checklist developed, through expert consensus, to capture minimumquality standards for intervention trials (Verhagen et al., 1998). This tool was
chosen to allow our readers to compare quality scores for studies in this review withthose reported by Chau et al. ( 2010). Items covered were the following: randomisation
method, treatment allocation concealment, similarity of groups at baseline on physical
activity or sedentary behaviour, speci ﬁcation of eligibility criteria, assessor blinding,
evidence of point estimates and validity of at least one of the sedentary behaviour
measures used to assess intervention promise, and presence of an intention to treat
analysis.
1Each of the seven items was coded as yes, no, unclear, or not applicable,
and a score of 1 was allocated for each ‘yes’response, and 0 for all other responses,
producing a 0 –7 quality index. This scoring system restricted single-arm study
designs to a maximum score of 3, as only three items were applicable (eligibility cri-
teria, point estimate and validity, and intention to treat). Inter-rater reliability was sub-stantial (90% agreement; ĸ= .80).94 B. Gardner et al.
Outcome data extracted related to whether sedentary behaviour was self-reported
or objectively measured, and, for each group, whether statistically signi ﬁcant within-
or between-group changes were found on any measure of sedentary behaviour at any
follow-up point. Inter-rater reliability was almost perfect (97%; ĸ= .93).
Intervention characteristics
Intervention characteristics, extracted for each treatment, related to the behaviours
explicitly targeted (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behaviour), the behaviour
change that was the primary aim of the intervention (e.g., to increase physical
activity), and the intervention functions and behaviour change techniques used. Theprimary behaviour change aim was coded from explicit statements of intervention
purpose where possible. Where no such statement was available, interventions were
assumed to have primarily targeted physical activity, not sedentary behaviour. Toensure data were extracted where sedentary behaviour was not an explicit target, func-
tions and techniques were coded where used to target sedentary behaviour and/or
physical activity; this ensured that data were extracted where sedentary behaviourchange was not an explicit intervention target.
Intervention functions. Each intervention was coded as performing one or more of
nine functions, using descriptions taken from the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michieet al., 2011, p. 7): education ( ‘increasing knowledge or understanding ’), persuasion
(‘using communication to induce positive or negative feelings or stimulate action ’),
incentivisation ( ‘creating expectation of reward ’), coercion ( ‘creating expectation of
punishment or cost ’), training ( ‘imparting skills ’), restriction ( ‘using rules to reduce
the opportunity to engage in the target behaviour [or to increase the target behaviourby reducing the opportunity to engage in competing behaviours] ’), environmental
restructuring ( ‘changing the physical or social context ’), modelling ( ‘providing an
example for people to aspire to or imitate’ ), and enablement ( ‘increasing means/redu-
cing barriers to increase capability or opportunity beyond environmental restructur-ing’). Inter-rater reliability for intervention functions was substantial (83%
agreement, ĸ= .67).
Behaviour change techniques. The Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1, a
reliable 93-item coding frame (Michie et al., 2013), was used to identify and characterise
techniques present in intervention and comparator treatment descriptions. Each of the93 behaviour change techniques was given a global rating as either present (1) or absent(0). The frequency with which techniques were delivered was not coded. Both coders
have extensive experience of coding behaviour change techniques, having coded tech-
niques for published reviews (e.g., Gardner et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2013), and
trained other coders in tutorials, organised by Michie and colleagues, on applying the
Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 to intervention descriptions (see Wood
et al., 2015). To avoid in ﬂating reliability due to agreed absence of most behaviour
change techniques, a conservative estimate was made based only on techniques ident-
iﬁed as present by either coder. Reliability was substantial (92% agreement, ĸ= .83).
Analysis strategy
Given that outcome data indicating change in sedentary behaviour were purposefully
selected to assess intervention potential, meta-analysis was not appropriate. Instead,Health Psychology Review 95
we divided interventions into three categories according to their apparent potential to
reduce sedentary behaviour. Potential was judged according to whether within- or
between-group analyses showed statistically signi ﬁcant reductions in sedentary behav-
iour at one or more follow-up points relative to baseline. Interventions were deemed
‘very promising ’where there were signi ﬁcant reductions in at least one sedentary be-
haviour indicator within the intervention group, andreduction on this indicator was
greater than observed in at least one comparator arm (i.e., control, or another inter-vention). Interventions were deemed ‘quite promising ’where there were either signiﬁ -
cant declines in at least one sedentary behaviour indicator within the intervention
group, orreduction in at least one sedentary behaviour indicator was greater than
observed in at least one comparator arm. Interventions were deemed ‘non-promising ’
where there were neither sedentary behaviour changes within the intervention arm nor
differences in sedentary behaviour change relative to at least one comparator arm.
This classi ﬁcation system was designed to ensure that interventions showing any
promise were coded as such, and that those showing the strongest evidence of
promise were distinguished from those with lesser evidence.
Descriptive and statistical analyses were undertaken to compare intervention
characteristics according to our ratings of promise. Chi-square tests were run toassess whether interventions that explicitly sought to reduce sedentary behaviour (or
to both reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity) were more promis-
ing than those that did not. Associations between intervention promise and thenumber of intervention functions and techniques observed were examined using
one-way ANOVAs, with two sets of planned comparisons, respectively, comparing
very and quite promising against non-promising interventions, and quite promisingagainst non-promising interventions. T-values and degrees of freedom were adjusted
where Levene ’s test indicated heterogeneity of variance. One-tailed p-values are
reported for all ANOVAs and t-tests.
The potential contribution of intervention functions and behaviour change tech-
niques to intervention promise was judged using a ‘promise ratio ’, which was calcu-
lated as the number of (very or quite) promising interventions featuring the function(or technique) divided by the number of non-promising interventions featuring the
function (or technique) (Martin et al., 2013). Functions and techniques were
deemed promising where used in at least twice as many promising as non-promising
interventions (i.e., promise ratio ≥2), and in at least two interventions in total (to
avoid over-interpreting scant data). Where functions or techniques were used onlyin (two or more) promising interventions (promise ratio = ∞), the number of interven-
tions in which they were used was reported instead of the ratio.
Given considerable interest in the potential for reducing sedentary behaviour in the
workplace (Chau et al., 2010; Shrestha et al., 2015), supplementary analyses were run
for interventions conducted in worksite settings. No paper described both worksite
and non-worksite interventions.

Twelve studies (46%) were conducted solely in Europe (including four undertaken in
the UK), eight (31%) in North America (seven in the USA), and ﬁve (19%) in Austra-
lia. One study combined samples from the UK, Australia, and Spain. Fourteen studies
(54%) were set in the workplace. Of the twelve non-worksite studies (46%), seven (27%
of all studies) were set in the community, two (8%) were hosted online, and one was
home-based. One intervention was conducted at a general practice, and for onestudy, the setting was unclear. Fifteen studies (58%) were conducted among employees
or ofﬁce workers; this included one study set outside of the worksite. Five (19%) were
conducted among older adults, four among the general public (15%), one among
parents, and one among a combined sample of school staff and parents.
In total, 10,355 participants were recruited. Sample size ranged from 12 to 7804
(median = 44), though 14 studies (54%) reported samples smaller than 50, and onlyﬁve (19%) reported sample sizes above 179. Most (22; 85%) were multi-arm trials:
17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two non-RCTs, and three quasi-experiments.Thirteen studies (50%) used a no-treatment control group, of which 10 (38% ofall studies) were two-arm intervention –control comparisons, and three (12%) com-
pared two interventions with a control. Nine studies (35%) compared multiple (two)interventions only, and four studies (15%) used single-arm designs. Time to ﬁnal
follow-up varied from 5 days to 12 months (median = 12 weeks).
Sedentary behaviour was most commonly measured as self-reported sitting
time (19 studies; 73%), but was objectively estimated using combinedaccelerometer –inclinometers in seven studies (27%), one of which also used direct
observation methods. Sedentary behaviour was mostly measured in relation towaking time only (19 studies; 73%), though seven worksite studies assessed work-site-based sedentary behaviour only (5 studies; 16%), or reported separate measures
of waking and worksite-based sedentary behaviour (2 studies; 8%).
Eleven studies (42%) mentioned a theory of behaviour, four of which mentioned
multiple (two) theories. The theories used were the Transtheoretical Model (sevenstudies), Social Cognitive Theory (four studies), the Theory of Planned Behaviour
(three studies), and Empowerment Theory (one study). Sedentary behaviour wasused as an eligibility criterion in six studies (23%). Study quality was generally low
(all studies: mean = 2.88, standard deviation [SD] = 1.40, median = 3; RCTs only:
mean quality = 3.47, SD = 1.32; non-RCTs, median = 3: mean = 1.78, SD = 0.67,median = 2; Table A3 in Supplemental material).
All interventions: intervention characteristics
Of the 38 interventions, 15 (39%) were judged very promising, 8 (21%) quite promis-
ing, and 15 (39%) non-promising (Table 2 ). Eight interventions (21%) primarily aimed
to reduce sedentary behaviour, and two (5%) aimed at both increased physical activity
and reduced sedentary behaviour, but most (23; 61%) targeted physical activity only.
Primary behaviour change aim was related to promise (χ
2[2] = 6.20, p= .045): very
and quite promising interventions primarily targeted sedentary behaviour more
often (respectively: 7 of 15 interventions, 46%; 2 of 8 interventions, 25%) than did
non-promising interventions (1 of 15 interventions; 7%).
Intervention functions . Seven intervention functions were each observed in at least one
intervention. Intervention promise was linked to the number of functions (F [2,35] =Health Psychology Review 99

aPromise ratio denotes the number of very or quite-promising interventions in which an intervention
function or behaviour change technique featured, divided by the number of non-promising interventions in
which it featured. Promise ratios only calculable for functions or techniques used in both promising and non-
promising interventions. Rows in bold denote functions or techniques associated with a promise ratio of 2 or
above, or used exclusively in promising interventions and featuring in at least two interventions.Health Psychology Review 101
3.86, p= .03): very promising (mean functions per intervention = 1.93, SD = 1.28) and
quite promising interventions (mean functions = 2.13, SD = 1.13) reported more func-
tions than did non-promising interventions (mean functions = 1.07, SD = 0.59; t
[18.93] = 5.54, p< .001). Quite promising interventions reported more functions
than did non-promising interventions (t [9.13] = 2.48, p= .04).
Most frequently used were enablement (33 interventions; 87%), education (12
interventions; 32%), and environmental restructuring (6 interventions; 16%). Four
intervention functions were deemed promising: education (promise ratio = 3.0), per-
suasion (ratio = 3.0), environmental restructuring (6 interventions, all of which werepromising), and training (5 interventions, all promising).
Behaviour change techniques . Thirty-seven behaviour change techniques were each
used in at least one intervention. There was no overall association between interven-
tion promise and the number of techniques (F [2,35] = 1.59, p= .22), but promising
interventions used more techniques (very promising, mean number of techniques
per intervention = 7.27, SD = 5.19; quite promising, mean techniques = 7.00, SD =
2.83) than did those with no evidence of promise (mean techniques = 4.87, SD =2.70; t[27.59] = 5.19, p< .001). Quite promising and non-promising interventions
did not differ ( t[13.81] = 1.75, p= .10).
The most frequently observed behaviour change techniques were setting behav-
ioural goals (23 interventions; 61%), providing unspeci ﬁed forms of social support
(23 interventions; 61%), and adding objects to the environment (19 interventions;50%). Eighteen techniques were found to be promising, for eleven of which promiseratios could be calculated: self-monitoring behaviour (used in 15 interventions;
promise ratio = 4.0), problem solving (10 interventions, ratio = 4.0), restructuring
the social environment (4 interventions, ratio = 3.0), providing information onhealth consequences (11 interventions, ratio = 2.7), behaviour substitution (7 interven-
tions, ratio = 2.5), unspeci ﬁed social support (ratio = 2.3), providing feedback on be-
haviour (12 interventions, ratio = 2.0), setting outcome goals (9 interventions, ratio
= 2.0), reviewing behavioural goals (6 interventions, ratios = 2.0), using prompts or
cues (6 interventions, ratio = 2.0), and providing practical social support (3 interven-
tions, ratio = 2.0). Restructuring the physical environment (5 interventions), behav-ioural practice or rehearsal (4 interventions), pros and cons (4 interventions), social
rewards (3 interventions), and habit formation, commitment, and discrepancy
between current behaviour and goals (2 interventions respectively) were used in prom-ising interventions only.
Worksite-based interventions only: intervention characteristics
Of the twenty interventions, seven (35%) were judged very promising, ﬁve (25%) quite
promising, and eight (40%) non-promising. Primary behaviour change aim was related
to promise ( χ
2[2] = 6.36, p= .02): very promising interventions tended to have primar-
ily targeted sedentary behaviour either solely or jointly with physical activity (5 of 7interventions; 71%), but quite promising (1 of 5; 20%) and non-promising interven-tions (1 of 8; 13%) did not.
Intervention functions . Intervention promise was linked to the number of functions
(F[2,17] = 4.38, p= .03): very promising (mean functions per intervention = 2.43,102 B. Gardner et al.
SD = 1.62) and quite promising interventions (mean functions = 1.40, SD = 0.55) used
more functions than did non-promising interventions (mean functions = 0.88, SD =
0.35; t[8.34] = 4.20, p= .002). Quite and non-promising interventions did not differ
(t[6.12] = 1.91, p= .10).
Most frequently used were enablement (16 interventions; 80%) and environmental
restructuring (6; 30%), the latter mostly capturing provision of standing workstations(5; 25%; Table A4 in Supplemental material). Two functions were deemed promising:
environmental restructuring (used in promising interventions only), and education
(5 interventions; promise ratio = 4.0).
Behaviour change techniques . Twenty-eight behaviour change techniques were each
observed in at least one intervention. There was no overall association between inter-
vention promise and the number of techniques (F [2,17] = 2.02, p= .16), but more
promising interventions used more techniques (very promising, mean number of tech-
niques per intervention = 8.57, SD = 6.78; quite promising, mean techniques = 5.60,
SD = 2.07) than did non-promising interventions (mean techniques = 4.13, SD =
1.81; t[8.30] = 3.59, p= .007). Quite promising and non-promising interventions did
not differ ( t[7.71] = 1.31, p= .23).
The most frequently observed techniques were setting behavioural goals (13 inter-
ventions; 65%), providing unspeci ﬁed forms of social support (10 interventions; 50%),
instructing on how to perform the behaviour (10 interventions; 50%), self-monitoring
behaviour (9; 45%), adding objects to the environment (9; 45%), and action planning
(8; 40%). Fourteen techniques were found to be promising, for six of which promiseratios could be calculated: self-monitoring of behaviour (promise ratio = 3.5),
adding objects to the environment (ratio = 3.5), instruction on how to perform the be-
haviour (ratio = 2.3), reviewing behavioural goals, providing information on healthconsequences, and behaviour substitution (each used in 6 interventions, ratios =
2.0). Restructuring the physical environment (used in 5 interventions), problem
solving (4 interventions), discrepancy between current behaviour and goal (2 interven-tions), feedback on behaviour (2 interventions), providing practical social support
(2 interventions), social comparison (2 interventions), behavioural practice or rehear-
sal (2 interventions), and restructuring the social environment (2 interventions) wereused in promising interventions only.
Discussion
This review is the ﬁrst to have focused on the behaviour change methods used in seden-
tary behaviour change interventions in adults. Twenty-six studies, reporting 38 inter-
ventions, were identi ﬁed. Despite studies generally being low-quality, and
intervention design mostly eschewing behavioural theory, the interventions generallyshowed promise in reducing sedentary behaviour. Four intervention functions –edu-
cation, environmental restructuring, persuasion, and training –showed potential for
engineering reduction in sedentary behaviour. Eighteen behaviour change techniquesshowed promise, with self-monitoring of behaviour, problem solving, and changingthe social or physical environment showing particular promise.
Sedentary behaviour has traditionally been equated with physical inactivity, and
many interventions in our review reported sedentary behaviour as one of many out-comes related to physical activity. The most promising interventions were those thatHealth Psychology Review 103
primarily aimed to change sedentary behaviour, rather than physical activity. Several
interventions focusing on physical activity that were included in this review achieved
changes in activity, but not sedentary behaviour. While time spent in sedentary behav-iour tends to correlate negatively with time in moderate-to-vigorous activity
(Mansoubi, Pearson, Biddle, & Clemes, 2014; Ryan et al., 2011), this relationship is
often small to moderate in strength. As our data suggest, reduction of sedentary be-
haviour is not an inevitable consequence of effective activity-promotion interventions.
This demonstrates the importance of treating sedentary behaviour as independent of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity when designing interventions to reduce seden-tary time (Prince et al., 2014).
One intervention that targeted sedentary behaviour only had no impact on seden-
tary time (Evans et al., 2012). This highlights the potential for sedentary behaviour
change interventions to fail, and testi ﬁes to the importance of identifying intervention
components that may contribute to effectiveness (Michie & Abraham, 2004). We
applied two coding frames to characterise interventions according to the functionsthat they played (e.g., education, persuasion, training), and the behaviour change tech-
niques used. Using these coding frames to analyse existing interventions can reveal the
approaches and techniques associated with effective interventions (Dombrowski et al.,2012; Gilinsky et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2013). Our review showed that self-monitor-
ing behaviour, problem solving, modifying social and physical environments, andgiving information on the health impact of sitting were most closely associated withpromising interventions. This echoes previous work identifying provision of sit-
stand desks and personalised advice as effective in reducing sedentary behaviour
(Shrestha et al., 2015). The techniques identi ﬁed here might fruitfully be incorporated
into future sedentary behaviour change interventions.
Where explicit theory use is rare, as was found among many interventions in this
review, identifying common intervention functions and techniques can also reveal theimplicit assumptions that intervention developers have made regarding why people
engage in sedentary behaviour and do not spend more time standing or in light or
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (see Gardner et al., 2010). The most frequently
used intervention functions were enablement (i.e., facilitating reduction in sedentary
behaviour), education, and environmental restructuring, and the most commonly
used techniques were setting behavioural goals, providing unspeciﬁ ed forms of
social support, and adding objects to the environment (activity monitors or sit-
stand desks). This suggests that intervention developers have tended to conceive of
sedentary behaviour as largely determined by external environments, or as a self-regu-latory problem, and that people would be willing to reduce their sedentary time if the
environment were modi ﬁed, or if supported in developing self-regulatory skills for
sitting less. These assumptions are not unfounded; modifying the environment by pro-
viding sit-stand desks often reduces time spent sedentary (e.g., Alkhajah et al., 2012),
and self-regulatory skills, such as self-monitoring, action planning, and goal setting,have been shown to be potent techniques across behaviour domains, including increas-ing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (Dombrowski et al., 2012; Gilinsky et al.,
2015; Michie, Abraham, et al., 2009). Yet, behaviour is determined by capability,
opportunity, and motivation (Michie et al., 2011). By focusing primarily on increasing
individuals ’psychological capability to reduce sedentary behaviour (through, for
example, goal setting), and maximising opportunities to limit or restrict sedentary be-haviour (e.g., through modifying the physical environment). Sedentary behaviour104 B. Gardner et al.
reduction interventions may have given insuf ﬁcient attention to motivation. Surpris-
ingly few interventions sought to motivate participants through information provision
or education. The dangers of sedentary behaviour may be poorly understood, giventhat it has only relatively recently been recognised as a health concern within the scien-
tiﬁc community (SBRN, 2012). Future work might investigate the scope to bring
about signi ﬁcant population-level reductions in sedentary behaviour through infor-
mation provision.
Our results highlight a reliance to date on study designs from which de ﬁnitive con-
clusions about intervention effectiveness cannot be drawn. Only six studies speci ﬁed
sedentary behaviour as an inclusion criterion. Intervention effects may be underesti-mated where the most sedentary, who have most to bene ﬁt, are not especially targeted.
The observed effectiveness of any intervention is also dependent on the nature of the
control group; effects may be suppressed where those in the comparison condition also
receive an intervention (de Bruin, Viechtbauer, Hospers, Schaalma, & Kok, 2009).
True estimation of the effectiveness of sedentary behaviour reduction interventions
requires comparison with a group that received no treatment. Yet, only half of all
studies employed RCT designs with no-treatment control groups. Several studies
used uncontrolled study designs, which are particularly problematic. One study indi-cated that, among an older adult sample, TV viewing –i.e., a behaviour commonly
undertaken while sedentary –increased over time (Gardner, Iliffe, Fox, Jefferis, &
Hamer, 2014). An apparent lack of change in sedentary behaviour within an uncon-
trolled study may represent signi ﬁcant behaviour change relative to a control group
for whom sedentary behaviour naturally increased. We recognise the utility of uncon-trolled designs for cost-effective, early-phase intervention piloting (Fitzsimons et al.,2013). Nonetheless, the evidence base for ‘what works ’and‘why’with regards to redu-
cing sedentary behaviour is presently weak due to suboptimal evaluation designs.
Limitations of our study must be acknowledged. The evidence synthesis was
undertaken to point to which strategies offer promise for reducing sedentary behav-
iour. Our classi ﬁcation system, whereby the level of intervention promise was deter-
mined based on whether between- or within-group change was observed on at least
one measure of sedentary behaviour, was ultimately arbitrary. We may also have over-
estimated the true potential of two interventions for which change was observed on
only one of multiple sedentary behaviour indices (Alkhajah et al., 2012; Evans
et al., 2012). Our judgements of intervention potential cannot be directly compared
with those from previous reviews of the effectiveness of sedentary behaviour changeinterventions, which used standardised outcomes (Prince et al., 2014; Shrestha
et al., 2015). Intervention promise was partly determined by between-group change,
so may have been underestimated in ﬁve studies that assessed multiple, equally effec-
tive interventions in the absence of a no-treatment control arm.
Studies were included only where sedentary behaviour was measured objectively,
using an accelerometer –inclinometer, which reliably distinguishes sitting from stand-
ing or light activity (Grant et al., 2006), or as self-reported time spent sitting. These
criteria excluded studies in which sedentary behaviour was inferred from accelerome-
try data indicating minimal or no physical activity, but retained studies using self-
report measures, which can underestimate true sedentary behaviour (Aguilar-Farías,Brown, Olds, & Peeters, 2014). Physical activity and sedentary behaviour are,
however, conceptually discrete (SBRN, 2012), and are thought to pose independent
health risks (Wilmot et al., 2012), and so syntheses of sedentary behaviour changeHealth Psychology Review 105
interventions demand outcome measures that discern sedentary behaviour from phys-
ical activity. A comparative study showed that accelerometer –inclinometers yielded
near-perfect correlation with directly observed sedentary minutes (r = 0.94), whereas
an accelerometer without inclinometer produced a considerably weaker correlation(r= 0.39; Kozey-Keadle, Libertine, Lyden, Staudenmayer, & Freedson, 2011).
Additionally, our self-report criteria excluded studies in which sedentary behaviour
was inferred from time spent in typically sedentary tasks, such as screen time (TV
viewing, computer use), reading, talking on the phone, or engaging in hobbies (Gar-
diner, Clark, et al., 2011). Our search identi ﬁedﬁve studies that had sought to reduce
time spent in these activities, which would otherwise have met our inclusion criteria
(Fitzgibbon et al., 2005; French, Gerlach, Mitchell, Hannan, & Welsh, 2011;J a g o
et al., 2013; Otten, Jones, Littenberg, & Harvey-Berino, 2009; Steeves, Bassett, Fitz-
hugh, Raynor, & Thompson, 2012). The ﬁve studies reported seven interventions.
All focused on TV-viewing time, of which one was very promising, three quite prom-
ising, and two non-promising, while for one, promise could not be reliably codedbecause statistical signi ﬁcance of observed changes was not reported (Jago et al.,
2013). (For completeness, the characteristics of these studies, including intervention
functions and behaviour change techniques, are provided in Table A5 in Supplementalmaterial.) While exclusion of these studies may have overlooked important strategies
for reducing sedentary screen time, time spent in typically sedentary tasks does not
reliably reveal sedentary behaviour. Studies of the determinants of sedentary behav-iour have treated TV-viewing as an archetypal sitting-based activity (Rhodes et al.,
2012), and a study (published after our review was completed) suggested that, on
average, seated TV-viewing yields an energy expenditure of 1.33 METs/min
(Mansoubi et al., 2015), so meets the de ﬁnition of a sedentary behaviour (SBRN,
2012). Yet, this estimate was based on participants who were asked to watch TV
while seated. To our knowledge, there is no evidence available on the extent towhich –or the proportion of people for whom –real-world TV-viewing is a truly seden-
tary activity. Moreover, using TV-viewing as an indicator of sedentary behaviour inintervention research neglects the possibility that, by incorporating light activityinto otherwise sedentary routines (Rovniak et al., 2014; Steeves et al., 2012), substan-
tial reductions may be achieved in sedentary behaviour with little or no change inviewing time. The development of effective strategies to reduce sedentary behaviourdepends upon intervention evaluations using measures that distinguish true sedentary
behaviour from time spent in activities that are normally performed while seated, but
could be performed while physically active.
We judged intervention components to have potential where they were used in two
or more interventions, and at least twice as many promising as non-promising inter-ventions. These criteria may have been too conservative, neglecting potentially fruitfulcomponents that may have been infrequently used. Interventions and components
deemed ‘non-promising ’may not be ineffective; rather, there is presently insuf ﬁcient
or inconsistent evidence for them to be recommended. Publication bias makes possible
that the potential contributions of some intervention functions and techniques to
reductions in sedentary behaviour may have been overstated because ineffective inter-
ventions featuring such components were unavailable for review. Exploratory studiesmight test more rigorously the effectiveness of lesser-used functions and techniques, or
those for which evidence is inconclusive.106 B. Gardner et al.
Interventions are typically poorly reported (Lorencatto, West, Stavri, & Michie,
2013), and so potentially important intervention components may not have been
coded. Some techniques and functions may be more likely to be reported than others
(Lorencatto et al., 2013). While we approached authors for further information, the
response rate was low. This emphasises the need for thorough intervention descriptionsto be made publicly accessible. We echo previous calls for interventions to be describedusing the standardised terminology of the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1
(Michie et al., 2013) and for additional materials to be posted as supplementary
material or made permanently available in institutional repositories.
Our coding approach decontextualised intervention components. We coded for the
presence of techniques, but not the frequency or intensity with which they were used.
Intervention reports do not often describe the frequency with which techniques aredelivered; extracting such information typically requires observation of intervention
delivery sessions (Lorencatto, West, Christopherson, & Michie, 2013). Moreover, we
coded for functions and techniques used to target either sedentary behaviour or phys-
ical activity, and it is possible that intervention components that successfully increase
physical activity may not effectively reduce sedentary behaviour, and vice versa.
However, it is dif ﬁcult to conceptually separate physical activity promotion and seden-
tary behaviour reduction components: some interventions apparently targeted activity
only, yet achieved changes in sedentary behaviour, whereas others targeted both
activity and sedentary behaviour, and either sought to substitute sedentary behaviourfor physical activity, or failed to distinguish potentially discrete activity- and seden-
tary-focused components. Future evidence syntheses will be aided by clearer delinea-
tion, where possible, of strategies used to change physical activity and sedentarybehaviour, respectively, in intervention reports. Relatedly, because we did not code
to which behaviour each intervention component related, some techniques may have
appeared unpromising because they were used in relation to increasing physicalactivity (e.g., self-monitoring bouts of activity), rather than reducing sedentary behav-
iour (self-monitoring sitting time). Additionally, techniques can have greater effect
where delivered as part of a package, rather than in isolation. Previous work hasshown that combining self-regulatory behaviour change techniques yields greater
effects than any of these techniques in isolation (Dombrowski et al., 2012; Michie,
Abraham, et al., 2009). More broadly, intervention effectiveness may depend not
only on functions and BCTs, but also on how they are delivered, to whom, in thatformat, with what intensity, and for how long (Davidson et al., 2003). These elements
were outside of the scope of this review, but nonetheless, interactions between content
and other characteristics not coded here may perhaps explain variation. It is conse-
quently unclear whether the functions or techniques identi ﬁed here as promising
would retain their promise across all settings and populations. Indeed, our supplemen-
tary analyses showed different patterns of promising functions and techniques across
worksite and non-worksite settings. Worksite sedentary behaviour may be more recep-
tive to, for example, prior planning and routinisation than non-worksite sedentary be-haviour, which occurs in less predictable and structured contexts. Intervention
components should be chosen on the basis of what is most appropriate and feasible
in the local setting (Michie, Atkins, & West, 2014).
Behavioural interventions show promise for reducing sedentary behaviour, and
those designed with the primary aim of reducing sedentary behaviour rather thanincreasing physical activity show the most promise. Intervention designers shouldHealth Psychology Review 107
consider using environmental restructuring, and self-regulatory techniques such as
self-monitoring, problem solving, and providing information on health consequences,
as these have been more common in promising than non-promising interventions. Yet,the evidence base is weakened by low-quality study designs, reliance on self-report,
and small samples. Future trials should employ more rigorous evaluation methods,
ideally using accelerometer –inclinometer data from large RCTs with no-treatment
comparison groups.
