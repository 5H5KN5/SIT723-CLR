Abstract
Background: As the number of people living with dementia grows, so does the need to provide them with
adequate psychosocial support. Many people with dementia live at home with family carers, who also require social
and emotional support to cope with their role. Community group singing has received attention for its potential to
support people with dementia and their carers. It is postulated that singing can improve cognitive function,
strengthen the bonds between care partners and help to establish social support networks. However, there is a lack
of rigorous evidence of singing ’s benefits for this population. This study aims to test the feasibility of a randomised
controlled trial of community singing in dementia, to pave the way for a larger, conclusive study.
Methods: The PRESIDE study is designed as a two-arm, parallel-group randomised trial with a waiting list control.
Dyads consisting of a person with dementia ( n= 80) and their carer ( n= 80) will be recruited. Each dyad will be
randomised either to attend 10 weeks of community group singing sessions straight away or to wait for 3 months
before attending the sessions. The singing sessions will be led by experienced professional musicians and will last
about 90 min, including time for socialising. The primary outcome of this study is the attainment of feasibility
criteria around recruitment, retention and the acceptability of the waiting list control. Secondary outcomes include
the quality of life, mood, cognition, and musical engagement of the person with dementia, and quality of life,
mood, and experiences/challenges of the carer. These data will be collected during home visits at baseline, and 3
and 6 months post-baseline.
Discussion: Despite growing public interest in the positive effects of singing, and encouraging findings from
qualitative and non-randomised quantitative studies, there is a lack of rigorous evidence. This is the first randomised
controlled trial of community group singing for people with dementia in Europe, to our knowledge. If the results
favour a full trial, conclusively demonstrating the effectiveness of group singing could positively affect the
opportunities available to community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers.

Introduction
Background and rationale
As our population ages, the number of people living
with dementia is set to increase, with an estimated 2
million people predicted to have the condition in the UK
by 2050. Although dementia is progressive, people may
live for many years after diagnosis. Residential care is an
option for those with higher needs, but the majority
(61%) of people with dementia live in the community,
many supported by family carers [ 1]. People with de-
mentia are at greater risk of loneliness and mental health
problems than the general population [ 2,3]. Although
many family carers find their role rewarding, caring re-
sponsibilities can incur a significant psychological and
physical strain. Unless they are well resourced and sup-
ported, carers may find themselves at heightened risk of
depression and anxiety, and consequently with poor
quality of life [ 4]. If caregivers experience unalleviated
and overwhelming challenges in their role, this may re-
sult in earlier admission to residential care for the per-
son with dementia, leading to a lower quality of life for
them and increased pressure on social care services [ 5].
Consequently, there is a need for psychosocial inter-
ventions, which support people with dementia and their
carers to live well with the condition for as long as pos-
sible. One such intervention is cognitive stimulation
therapy (CST), which can improve cognition and quality
of life for people with dementia and is recommended by
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) for all people with mild or moderate dementia
[6,7]. Community group singing is growing in popular-
ity as an activity to support the mental well-being of
people with dementia and their carers. There is evidence
from neuropsychology that singing provides cognitive
stimulation through multiple effects on the brain, but
that response to singing is mediated by clinical and
demographic factors [ 8]. A randomised trial compared
the effects of singing, listening to music and usual care
for person with dementia/carer dyads, and found that
both singing and listening to music improved mood,
orientation and remote episodic memory, whilst singing
also improved carer well-being [ 9]. Qualitative evidence
indicates that singing for people with dementia has a
positive effect on the relationship between couples when
one partner has a diagnosis of dementia [ 10] whilst a
study of group singing in the general population has in-
dicated that it may accelerate social bonding [ 11].Participants at singing groups for those with dementia
have also reported that they find the support network pro-
vided by meeting other people in a similar situation very
helpful [ 12]. Meanwhile, there is evidence from a rando-
mised controlled trial that group singing is a cost-effective
way of improving quality of life and reducing anxiety and
depression for people over the age of 60 [ 13].
Despite the growing interest in group singing for
people with dementia, there is a lack of conclusive evi-
dence about its effects. To date, no published large-
scale, randomised study has evaluated group singing for
people with dementia and their carers in the community.
A study of this kind has recently been completed in
Australia (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials
Registry (ANZCTR) ID: ACTRN12617001513303) and
the results are pending publication (this study has sing-
ing groups facilitated by music therapists whilst the facil-
itators in the present study are community musicians, so
this will make an interesting point for comparison). Evi-
dence from smaller studies is variable; several studies
found no change on standardised measures of quality of
life, mood, or neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia,
but reported favourable qualitative findings [ 14–16]. In a
small pre-post study of group singing which showed im-
provements in quality of life, self-esteem and social sup-
port for people with dementia and their carers, the
authors call for an evidence base to demonstrate the psy-
chological benefits and potential for improvement in
cognitive function which they believe group singing af-
fords [ 17]. Therefore, there is an identified need for
rigorous RCT evidence to isolate the effects of group
singing for people with dementia and their carers. Such
evidence could inform health and social care policy, help
to secure additional funding for group singing and po-
tentially reduce the pressure on health and social care
services by improving support for people living with de-
mentia in the community and their carers.
Study objectives
The primary objective of the PRESIDE study is to test
the protocol for a two-arm, parallel-group superiority
randomised trial of community singing in dementia with
a waiting-list control design. The relevant indicators are
recruitment, retention, and the acceptability of the trial
designs to the participants, including the waiting-list
control. The rationale for the waiting list design is that a
control group, which only receives care as usual, wouldDowson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:15 Page 2 of 13
be likely to experience resentful demoralisation with at-
tendant drop-out. If the results of this feasibility study
are favourable, a full-scale trial would aim to recruit 360
dyads, sufficient to identify a moderate effect size on
quality of life (0.3) [ 13,18].
The secondary objective of the study is to explore the
impact of group singing on people with dementia and
their carers, using quantitative and qualitative methods.
It is anticipated that this data will indicate suitable out-
come measures for the full trial, and improve our under-
standing of the mechanisms of action at play in group
singing for people with dementia.
Methods
Study design
This feasibility study is designed as a two-arm, parallel-
group randomised controlled trial of community singing
for people with dementia and their carers, with a
waiting-list control group. The study will aim to recruit
80 dyads each consisting of a person with dementia and
their carer. About half of the sample, selected at random,
will be invited to attend a singing group, whilst the other
half will be asked to wait for 3 months before being in-
vited to attend a group. Outcome data will be collected
at baseline (time 0), 3 months after baseline (time 1),
and 6 months after baseline (time 2).
Setting
The singing groups created for the study will take place
in community settings in Nottinghamshire, UK, and data
collection will take place during visits to participants at
home. The venues selected will be chosen for their suit-
ability for holding singing group sessions; this means
well-lit, attractive spaces with good acoustics that are
large enough to comfortably accommodate up to 50
people. Further considerations include the provision of
accessible facilities and a kitchen for refreshments, ad-
equate car parking and a reliable and frequent public
transport service nearby. We will focus on two geo-
graphical areas and will aim to recruit half the intended
target of 80 dyads in each of these areas. Recruitment
will be optimised by selecting venues in geographical
areas that are believed to have the highest levels of need
in terms of the provision of recreational singing for
people with dementia.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To be included in the study, participants with dementia
must
/C15Be aged 18 or over, and diagnosed with dementia,
which is at a mild or moderate level
/C15Have a carer who spends at least 2 h per week with
them/C15Be able to give informed consent at the start of the
study
/C15Be able to speak and understand English1
/C15Be willing in principle to join a singing group and
attend weekly
Participants with dementia will be excluded if
/C15They lack capacity to give informed consent
/C15They are already attending a singing group or have
done so in the past 6 weeks (other than religious
services)
/C15They have a significant hearing impairment
/C15They are already participating in any other
interventional study
/C15They have a history of severe mental illness or drug/
alcohol addiction
Carers can be included if they are
/C15Able to speak and understand English
/C15Willing in principle to attend the group weekly
/C15Able to give informed consent
Relationships between people with dementia and their
carers may be that of spouses/partners, parent/child or
other family members, or friends. In certain cases, pro-
fessional caregivers may be part of the study if no family
member or friend is available to accompany a person
with dementia to the sessions and if the same profes-
sional caregiver is available each week. The nature of the
relationship between the dyads does not matter, but it is
important that the same carer attends the sessions
throughout the study.
Intervention
The intervention in this study is attendance at weekly
singing group sessions for 10 weeks. Each session will in-
clude approximately 60 min of warm-up activities and
singing, with about 30 min for refreshments and socialis-
ing before or after the session. The sessions will be run
jointly by two professional community musicians who
have extensive experience of running similar singing
groups together. The format of the sessions includes a
full physical and vocal warm-up, followed by singing fa-
miliar songs accompanied by guitar. Themed songbooks
will be provided for participants; each week a different
songbook will be selected by the facilitators, so each ses-
sion will have a different theme. Themes might include
songs about the weather, from a particular era, or
1Participants with aphasia or other speech problems will be included
unless these were so severe that the participant could not answer the
questionnaires, or communicate their answers in an alternative way.Dowson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:15 Page 3 of 13
relating to the current season (e.g. Christmas, summer).
Singing group participants will be encouraged to choose
their favourite songs from the books for the whole group
to sing. The facilitators ’approach will emphasise that
the aim of the group is to sing for fun and enjoyment,
and that the participants ’musical skills or singing voices
are not being assessed or judged.
The content of each session will be fully documented,
and three out of every ten sessions will be video re-
corded in order to check that the intervention is deliv-
ered consistently. Attendance at singing sessions will be
monitored and recorded. Participants will be free to miss
individual sessions or withdraw from the singing group
entirely as they wish, and they do not need to give a
reason.
Since each singing group can accommodate up to 20
dyads, we propose to run four groups in total in two dif-
ferent geographical areas. The first two groups will be
set up for those allocated to the intervention group; after
the 3 month waiting period, we will start another two
groups for those in the waiting-list control group. There
is provision for those in the intervention group to con-
tinue to attend the singing groups after the initial 10-
week period, if they wish to. This is for ethical reasons
and to facilitate embedding the groups into the local
community, as discussed later in the “Ethics and dissem-
ination ”section. Continued attendance by participants
in the intervention group will not compromise the pri-
mary objectives of recruitment, retention and acceptabil-
ity, and its effects on the 6-month data collection are
considered an acceptable trade-off.
Control condition
Participants who are allocated to the waiting-list control
group will receive care as usual during the 3 months that
they will be required to wait before beginning to attend
a singing group. They will be requested to abstain from
attending other organised group singing activities during
this time, with the exception of religious services.
Endpoints
Since PRESIDE is a feasibility study, the endpoint is the
attainment of the feasibility criteria at 6 months. The
proposed criteria for proceeding to a full trial are 70%
recruitment; 70% retention of participants over 3
months; and acceptability of the control condition dem-
onstrated by 70% of the waiting-list participants starting
singing groups after being on the waiting list. The ac-
ceptability of the control condition is considered to be
the most important of these three criteria since this en-
sures the heterogeneity of the sample. The other feasibil-
ity criteria are considered negotiable.
An additional endpoint for PRESIDE is the measure-
ment of quality of life, activities of daily living, mood,musical engagement and cognition of people with de-
mentia, and the measurement of quality of life, mood,
caring relationship and experience of caring for the
carers of the people with dementia. Each dyad ’s use of
health social care services and resources will also be doc-
umented. Additionally, qualitative data will be collected
using interviews and participant observation, in order to
better understand the experiences of dyads who attend
the singing groups.
Participant timeline in study
Figure 1shows the timeline of participants in the study,
whilst Fig. 2gives the schedule of assessment and enrol-
ment for the study. Since we need to recruit a sufficient
number of participating dyads before the singing groups
can begin, there will be a delay between recruitment and
beginning the singing group or waiting list control for
participants who are recruited early. We will not collect
baseline data or randomise participants until the singing
groups are just about to start.
Sample size
As PRESIDE is a feasibility study with two arms, it is
suggested 40 dyads per arm will provide enough infor-
mation to inform future, definitive RCT design and im-
plementation [ 19]. Therefore the recruitment target is
80 patient-carer dyads in total in the current study.
Allocation and blinding
Participants will be recruited in pairs consisting of a per-
son with dementia and a carer. They will be randomised
in pairs to either the intervention group or the waiting-
list control group. Randomisation will be stratified by
sex and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Randomisation
will be carried out using a web application created by
the trial programmer at the University of Nottingham
Stroke Trials Unit, using web and database servers pro-
vided by University of Nottingham Information Services
(IS). The researcher (BD) will use this web application to
randomise each participant. The system will hide infor-
mation relating to the intervention groups from other
users until explicitly granted access by the trial program-
mer, for example, when a statistician requires unblinded
data.
Dyads will be randomly allocated to intervention or
waiting-list control groups by the web-based system. BD
will collect baseline data prior to randomisation, and so
will be unaware of allocation until the initial data collec-
tion is complete. Thereafter, both the researcher (BD)
and the participants will be aware of the group alloca-
tion, along with those delivering the sessions. Due to the
nature of the intervention and control groups, it is not
feasible to blind participants to group allocation; they
will know whether they are attending singing groupDowson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:15 Page 4 of 13
sessions. The research team will be split into two groups,
which will define their access to data and to group allo-
cation. The data management group will be responsiblefor the data collection and running of the study, and will
not be blinded to group allocation once baseline data
collection has taken place. The data analysis group willFig. 1 Participant timeline in studyDowson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:15 Page 5 of 13
be responsible for conducting the analysis, and will re-
main blinded to group allocation for the duration of the
study. The data analysis group will not have any contact
with study participants.
Follow-up data collection will be undertaken by re-
searchers who are blinded to group allocation. However,
since the participants will know their own group alloca-
tion, there is a possibility that they will reveal this during
the follow-up data collection. Unblinding of outcome as-
sessors which occurs in this way will be recorded. Allresearchers undertaking data collection will have been
fully trained in the administration of these instruments.
Recruitment
We will recruit for the study through various channels
in order to maximise the chances of reaching as many
people with dementia as possible. We will recruit
through NHS Memory Assessment Services by publicis-
ing the study to people who have recently been diag-
nosed with dementia. We also have agreement from theFig. 2 Schedule of enrolment, intervention and assessment for PRESIDEDowson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:15 Page 6 of 13
Alzheimer ’s Society to advertise the study to people who
are currently on the waiting list in the area for Singing
for the Brain sessions. We will harness the support of
local community organisations, charities and the local
press, and will also use targeted social media advertising.
Recruitment will also be undertaken using the online
platform “Join Dementia Research ”.
Data collection
Quantitative data
Outcome measures will be administered to participants
during home visits arranged at times convenient to
them. Each visit is expected to take up to 2 h. Baseline
data collection will be conducted by BD, and follow-up
data collection by blinded researchers. All researchers
undertaking data collection will have been fully trained
in the administration of these instruments.
The following outcome measures have been selected
for use in the study. These are summarised in Table 1,
which also shows whether each measure corresponds to
the person with dementia, the carer, or both, as well as
who completes the measure (the person with dementia,
or the carer, either self- or proxy-rating). All outcome
measures will be administered at each of the three-time
points. Additionally, demographic data will be collected
from people with dementia (age, sex, diagnosis, date of
diagnosis, ethnicity, education, musical/singing experi-
ence) and from carers (age, sex, ethnicity, education,
musical/singing experience) at baseline. Measures will be
completed by the person with dementia themselves and/
or via a proxy rating by the carer. The carer will
complete outcome measures about their own mood,
quality of life and experience of caring. Some of thesemeasures will be administered by interview and some
will be self-completed by the carer.
A large number of outcome measures are included in
this study, in order to assess which of them might be
most suitable for future use in a full trial. We recognise
that data collection may be time-consuming and tiring
for participants, and consequently missing data and in-
complete measures are expected in some cases. The
order and format of the administration of outcome mea-
sures is given in Table 2. This order has been chosen so
that instruments measuring similar domains are sepa-
rated, to maximise the range of information included in
incomplete data sets. The interview with the carer will
take place first, and subsequently the person with de-
mentia will be interviewed whilst the carer does the self-
completed outcome measures.
Quality of life —Alzheimer ’s disease scale This 13-
item measure asks respondents to rate various aspects of
the person with dementia ’s life as poor, fair, good or ex-
cellent [ 20]. It will be completed by participants with de-
mentia, and a proxy rating will also be provided by the
carer. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 to 4, so the
measure yields a total score out of 52, where a higher
score indicates a higher quality of life.
EQ-5D-5L This instrument comprises five questions
about health-related quality of life, and a visual analogue
scale [ 21–23]. It will be completed by participants with
dementia and carers. The results will be used to calcu-
late Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for all partici-
pants. The first five questions are scored on a five-point
scale and generate a five-digit health state for each par-
ticipant (e.g. a score of 12345 would indicate no

problems with mobility, slight problems with self-care,
moderate problems doing usual activities, severe pain or
discomfort, and extreme anxiety or depression). The vis-
ual analogue scale is the final item of the EQ-5D-5L and
asks respondents to rate their current health as a point
on a line. This gives a score out of 100, where a higher
score indicates a higher perceived level of overall health.
Dementia quality of life This scale asks the person
with dementia to rate their quality of life by responding
to 29 questions about their feelings, memory and every-
day life [ 24]. The respondent selects ‘a lot ’,‘quite a bit ’,
‘a little ’or‘not at alL ’in response to each question. Each
question is scored on a scale from 1 to 4, giving a total
score out of 116 where a higher score indicates a higher
quality of life.
Bristol activities of daily living scale The 20-item scale
presents the respondent with various descriptions of per-
formance at activities such as cooking, hobbies and per-
sonal care, and asks them to rate the person with
dementia ’s current level of performance [ 25]. It will be
completed as a proxy rating by the carer. Each items is
scored on a scale of 0 to 3, and gives a total score out of
60, where a higher score means a higher level of
impairment.
Cornell scale for depression in dementia The 19-item
scale assesses symptoms of depression in people with de-
mentia and their severity [ 26]. It is completed through
interviews conducted with the person with dementia and
the carer separately, with the interviewer assigning a
score based on the severity of symptoms within the past
week. For each indicator of depression, absent symptoms
score 0, mild or intermittent symptoms score 1, and se-
vere symptoms score 2. The total score is out of 38,
where scores above 10 indicate probable major depres-
sion, and scores above 18 indicate definite major
depression.
Geriatric depression scale The 15-item version of this
scale presents the respondent with ‘yes/no ’questions
about how they have been feeling over the past twoweeks [ 27]. It will be completed by people with dementia
and carers. Each answer indicative of depression scores
one point. A score of 5 or higher is suggestive of a de-
pressive disorder, whilst a score of 10 or higher is indica-
tive of a probable depressive disorder.
Musical engagement questionnaire This scale has 35
items that ask the participant how they have used and
engaged with music over the past month [ 28]. It will be
completed by people with dementia. The scale consists
of statements such as ‘I play a song over and over if I
like it ’and the respondent indicates the extent to which
they agree with the statement on a five-point scale,
scored from 1 to 5. The total score is out of 175, and a
higher score indicates a higher level of musical
engagement.
ADAS-Cog The measure assesses a number of facets of
cognitive performance including memory, verbal skills,
motor skills, and orientation [ 29,30]. It will be com-
pleted by the person with dementia. The tests include
memorising a list of words, naming familiar objects as
they are presented, copying drawn shapes and following
verbal instructions. The interviewer also rates the par-
ticipant on their verbal fluency, comprehension and abil-
ity to concentrate. The total possible score is 70, with
higher scores indicating higher levels of cognitive
impairment.
Clinical dementia rating This instrument gathers data
through semi-structured interviews conducted with the
carer and the person with dementia [ 31]. The inter-
viewer uses this data to rate the severity and stage of
dementia across six different domains: memory, orienta-
tion, judgement/problem solving, community affairs and
home/hobbies. The rating of each of these domains is
used to generate an overall CDR score which indicates
the level of impairment present: 0 (none), 0.5 (question-
able), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe).
Quality of the carer-patient relationship scale The
14-item measure invites the respondent to state their
level of agreement with questions about their relation-
ship with the person for whom they care [ 32]. It will be
completed by carers. The responses are scored from 1 to
5, and the total score is out of 70, with a higher score in-
dicating higher perceived relationship quality.
Carers of older people in Europe scale The 15-item
scale asks the carer about their experiences of caregiving
and its consequences for their physical and mental
health [ 33]. The responses are scored from 1 (never) to
4 (always). The 15 questions are presented together, but
when total scores are calculated they are divided intoTable 2 Order and format of outcome measure administration

three subscales which are treated separately in analysis:
negative impact of caregiving, positive value of caregiv-
ing and quality of support. The precedent for the use of
these subscales in analysis is set in one of the paper de-
scribing the original development of COPE [ 34].
Short sense of competence questionnaire The SSCQ
is derived from the Zarit Burden Inventory and evaluates
the carer ’s experience of caring across seven items [ 35].
The carer indicates how strongly they agree with the
statements in the scale and each item is scored from 1
to 5. A higher score indicates a higher perceived sense of
competence.
Client service receipt inventory The CSRI is a tool to
measure consumption of services with a view to estimat-
ing their costs for economic analysis [ 36]. It will be ad-
ministered in a form adapted to the typical activities of
people with dementia and their carers, in order to meas-
ure the use of health and social carer resources by each
participant. This instrument will be completed by the
carer.
Qualitative data
Previous research into group singing for people with de-
mentia has shown that quantitative measures may not
capture the benefits perceived by participants [ 14,37].
Qualitative data concerning participants ’experience of
the singing groups will be collected during the study
using participant observation. BD will conduct struc-
tured in-person observations of 3-4 opportunistically se-
lected dyads in each singing group, including both
intervention and control group participants. Each dyad
will be the focus of observations three times: in one early
session, in one session towards the middle of the group ’s
course, and in one later session. Detailed notes on the
observations will be made after the sessions.
We will also collect qualitative data from a sub-sample
of participants through semi-structured interviews. We
will aim to interview 10 dyads in total, 12.5% of the 80-
dyad intended sample. Dyads will be selected for inter-
view opportunistically and those who do not wish to be
interviewed will be free to decline. We will interview at
least one dyad from each singing group and will aim to
spread the sample evenly between the groups. Interviews
will last 30-45 min, and each dyad will be interviewed to-
gether where possible. The interview guide will focus on
understanding participants ’experience of taking part in
the group. Interviews will be audio recorded if possible;
if participants decline to be recorded, we will seek their
permission to make written notes during the interviews.Data management
Each participant will be assigned a trial identity code
number, for use on case report forms (CRFs) and in the
database. The trial documents and database will also use
participants ’initials, sex and date of birth. Data will be
recorded for each participant using paper CRFs. The
data from these forms will be entered into the trial data-
base and stored electronically. Access to the database
will be password protected and restricted to trial
personnel, who will each have a unique login code and
PIN. The paper CRFs will be stored in a locked cup-
board on the University of Nottingham premises. Con-
sent forms (which contain participants ’real names) will
be stored separately in a different locked cupboard. Par-
ticipant ’s names and contact information will be securely
stored on a separate part of the database system, not as-
sociated with their trial data.
Any video or audio recordings taken during data col-
lection will be transferred daily from the recording de-
vice to password-protected encrypted drives on
University of Nottingham computers. They will then be
deleted from the recording device.
Data will be stored securely for 7 years after the last
person has been recruited. All data will be analysed on
University of Nottingham computers and backed up to
the University of Nottingham servers. Only members of
the research team authorised by the data custodian will
have access to the research data.
Data coding and analysis
Statistical analysis of quantitative data
Quantitative data analysis will be conducted by the study
statistician (BG), using the software package Stata 16.
The data analysis will be mainly descriptive [ 38]. All
measures will be summarised with mean and standard
deviation (S.D.) for normally distributed variables, me-
dian and inter-quartile range (IQR) for skewed variables,
and frequency (%) for response of categorical variables,
by intervention arm across follow-up time. Analysis of
Co-variance (ANCOVA) will be performed to quantify
treatment effect size and its precision by means of re-
gression modelling with baseline measures as covariate,
and to derive the change from baseline score for each
arm. Due to the non-independence of patient-carer dyad
measures and with data being measured repeatedly,
multivariate, multilevel modelling will be performed to
account for the association between the same kind of
outcome measure of patient-carer data and repeated
data. We will calculate recruitment rate, retention rate
and attrition rate, exploring patterns of missing data and
drop out from the intervention group and the waiting
list control group. All results will be used to inform fu-
ture definitive trial design.Dowson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:15 Page 9 of 13
Analysis of qualitative data
Recordings/notes from interviews and observational
notes will be transcribed as necessary and analysed using
NVivo 12. The technique for analysis will be the ‘general
inductive approach ’in which the coding is largely guided
by evaluation objectives [ 39]. The evaluation objectives
in this case will be the feasibility of the study design and
the experiences of all participants who attend a singing
group.
BD will undertake the first stage of the analysis and
will assign first-order codes to the data. Through discus-
sion with the rest of the research team, second-order
codes will then be developed. In order to enhance the
validity of the coding process, a sample of transcripts
and notes will be coded by another member of the re-
search team, and any disagreements between coders will
be discussed.
Data monitoring
A trial Data Management and Ethics Committee
(DMEC) will be formed, consisting of members who are
not part of the University of Nottingham. All the mem-
bers of the DMEC will have experience of running clin-
ical trials, and the group will include a statistician, an
academic and a clinician. The Chief Investigators (JS &
MO) will be the data custodians.
Adverse events
The occurrence of an adverse event as a result of partici-
pation in this study is not expected due to the nature of
the intervention, which is a non-clinical intervention
based on social music-making and has no known side ef-
fects. However, in order to provide further assurance of
the safety of the intervention, data on Severe Adverse
Events (SAEs) will be collected for people with dementia
and their carers during follow-up data collection at 3
and 6 months. Additionally, attendance at the group will
be monitored by the singing group facilitators and the
research associate, so any SAE which occurs amongst
the group members will be recorded. These include hos-
pitalisation, extension of hospitalisation, other serious
medical events and death. Such SAEs might conceivably
be related to participation in the intervention if they
were associated with falls, emotional arousal or
depression.
Ethics and dissemination
Ethical issues and approval
The application for ethical approval for PRESIDE was
submitted to the Health Research Authority ’s Social
Care Research Ethics Committee (SCREC) and received
a favourable opinion after some minor revisions. Ethical
approval for the study was granted in January 2020 and
the study entered the recruitment phase.Due to lower than anticipated recruitment figures and
advice from the PPI group, a substantial amendment to
the ethical application was submitted to the SCREC in
March 2020. This amendment removed a previous inclu-
sion criterion that stipulated that people with dementia
should have received their diagnosis within the past 12
months, thus opening the study to anyone with a diag-
nosis of dementia regardless of when it was made. This
amendment was approved by the SCREC in April 2020.
A major ethical issue for this trial is that it provides
the participants with the chance to attend a community
singing group which they may find supportive, helpful or
valuable. Therefore, it is important to consider what will
happen at the end of the trial, as the sudden cessation of
the singing groups could be harmful or upsetting to par-
ticipants. Although PRESIDE does not have the re-
sources to continue to run these groups indefinitely, we
aim to work with local organisations and charities to
embed the singing groups into the local community and
to make them sustainable in the longer term. This
process will be guided by the opinions and wishes of the
singing group participants.
Consent
All participants will provide written informed consent
before they participate in any study activities. Written
information sheets will be provided for people with de-
mentia and their carers. An easy-read information book-
let will also be provided to facilitate the understanding
of people with dementia. Potential participants who con-
tact the study team will be provided with a copy of the
participant information sheets. The researcher will visit
the potential study participants and will go through the
information sheets with them, answering any questions
that they have. If they agree to participate in the study,
and the researcher is satisfied that they have capacity to
provide informed consent to do so, they will be asked to
sign a consent form.
A person with dementia who does not have capacity
to consent to participate at the point of enrolment will
be excluded from the study. However, due to the pro-
gressive nature of dementia, participants with dementia
may lose capacity over the course of the study. Capacity
will be reassessed periodically throughout the course of
the study. If a person with dementia is judged to have
lost capacity in this regard, the carer who is taking part
in the study with them will be asked to act as consultee,
and to make a judgement about whether the person they
care for would have wanted to continue to take part.
The consultee will be provided with an information
sheet advising them about the study and the role of con-
sultee. If they judge that the person with dementia
would have wanted to continue to take part, the con-
sultee will sign a declaration form to indicate that this isDowson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:15 Page 10 of 13
their opinion. The consent of carers will be treated in
the same way; if a carer loses capacity to consent during
the course of the study, a consultee will be sought for
them.
Any participants who decide not to take part or who
are excluded because they lack capacity will be sign-
posted as far as possible to other community-based mu-
sical or creative groups that they may be able to access.
Confidentiality
Individual participant medical information obtained dur-
ing this study is considered confidential and will not be
disclosed to third parties except for reasons of data
monitoring and auditing, or where such disclosure is
considered necessary for the health or wellbeing of the
participant. Confidentiality will be ensured by using par-
ticipant identification codes to refer to stored data rather
than real names. When findings from the study are dis-
seminated or published, individual participants will not
be identifiable from the reports.
Dissemination
A journal paper describing the findings of the feasibility
study will be submitted for publication. The results of
the study will also be reported to at least one major de-
mentia conference. Participants in the study will be sent
a summary of results in the post if they wish. If the re-
sults of the study suggest that a full trial is feasible, a
protocol will be developed based on the results and sub-
mitted to a suitable research funding body.
Public involvement
A Public Participation and Involvement (PPI) group has
been set up for the study, and a convenor for the group
appointed. The group comprises individuals who either
have lived personal experience of dementia or experi-
ence of caring for someone with dementia. The scope of
the PPI group ’s role is as follows:
/C15Advising on issues around the acceptability of the
research process (e.g. recruitment, data collection)
/C15Refinement of research materials (e.g. participant
information sheets)
/C15Scrutiny of public-facing materials
/C15Advocacy for the research
/C15Advising about recruitment methods
/C15Helping with dissemination
Any suggestions, advice and feedback from the PPI
group will be implemented in this study where possible
or will be used to inform the design of future research.
PPI meetings take place every 3 months, and delegates
from the PPI group attend Project Management Group
meetings. The PPI group members are recompensed fortheir time and travel expenses. During the COVID-19
disruption, the PPI group continues to meet and to work
with the research team on related projects.
Discussion
Following ethical approval in January 2020, the study en-
tered recruitment, aiming to start the first singing group
in late April. This would require approximately 40 dyads
to have been recruited, in order to randomise about half
to the singing group and half to the waiting-list control.
There was a reasonably high level of interest in the study
but recruitment was slower than had been hoped for. It
was felt that the requirement for participants to have
been diagnosed within the past twelve months was hin-
dering recruitment, since quite a lot of interest had been
expressed by people with dementia who had been diag-
nosed for longer and therefore were not eligible. Conse-
quently, a major amendment was submitted to the SCRE
C in order to change the inclusion criteria. It is hoped
that this change will increase the rate of recruitment to
the study.
In March 2020, recruitment for PRESIDE was paused
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the immedi-
ate future is unclear, we hope that the initial ground-
work which we have done will help us to recruit more
rapidly for the study once it is deemed safe to restart. In
the meantime, our priority is to maintain an online pres-
ence and publicise the study in a way which will support
recruitment in the future.
