Abstract 
Background: Community- and strengths-based psychosocial interventions are central to mental health and psy-
chosocial support guidelines, but rigorous evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions is limited. The 
complexity and variability that is inherent to many community-based psychosocial interventions requires innovative 
strategies in order to facilitate the comparability and synthesis across research studies without compromising the fit 
and appropriateness of interventions to specific study populations and context. Entre Nosotras is a community-based 
psychosocial intervention developed for migrant and host community women that is designed to be flexible enough 
to enable integration of external intervention components and adaptable to diverse study contexts and populations. 
This protocol describes a study that aims to evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of integrating a 
standardized stress management intervention into Entre Nosotras.
Methods: This study will evaluate the appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, and safety of intervention and 
research procedures for a cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted in Ecuador and Panamá with 
migrant and host community women. In this feasibility trial, we will allocate communities nested within the three 
study sites to the integrated Entre Nosotras + stress management intervention versus Entre Nosotras alone through 
stratified randomization. Migrant and host community women residing in these study communities who report low 
to moderate levels of distress will be allocated to the intervention condition that their community is assigned (n 
= 220 total). We will collect quantitative measures of psychosocial wellbeing, psychological distress, coping, social 
support, and functioning from study participants. We will collect quantitative measures of fidelity and facilitator 
competencies through observation and facilitator self-assessment. Data on appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, 
and safety will be gathered from participants and facilitators through quantitative assessments at 0, 5, and 10 weeks

Background
By the end of 2020, over 80 million people were for -
cibly displaced due to persecution, conflict, violence, 
human rights violations, and other emergencies glob -
ally [1 ]. Displaced populations face increased exposure 
to potentially traumatic events and ongoing adversity 
that increase their risk of mental health and psycho -
social problems [2 –4]. The evidence supporting the 
effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial support 
(MHPSS) programs in humanitarian settings has grown 
over the past few decades [5 , 6]. However, existing evi -
dence is primarily available for focused psychological 
interventions to treat mental health problems adapted 
from interventions developed in high-income contexts 
as opposed to promotion and prevention programs 
designed within the target population that focus on 
mitigating risk of mental health problems and enhanc -
ing psychosocial wellbeing. Furthermore, few MHPSS 
interventions have focused on the social dimension of 
mental health and psychosocial wellbeing [5 ]. Social 
difficulties such as isolation, discrimination and xeno -
phobia, and lack of community support and connect -
edness are often salient problems affecting migrant 
communities [7 , 8]. These outcomes are rarely included 
as MHPSS intervention targets or outcomes in humani -
tarian settings.
Community- and strengths-based psychosocial inter -
ventions are central to MHPSS recommendations in 
humanitarian settings despite remaining underrepre -
sented in existing research evidence [6, 9, 10], and are 
considered a critical research priority [11]. Available evi -
dence from evaluations of psychosocial prevention and 
promotion interventions is heterogeneous with respect 
to the types of interventions and evaluation approaches, 
creating challenges for comparability and evidence syn -
thesis [6, 12]. Researchers have argued that in order to 
advance the evidence on psychosocial interventions 
there needs to be better specification of interventions 
to enable replication, design and tailoring of psychoso -
cial interventions for specific subgroups (e.g., women) 
and subgroup-specific outcomes, and rigorous evalua -
tions of community-based interventions that enhance psychosocial wellbeing through improved social and 
community-related processes [5, 6, 13].
In the proposed multi-site study, we aim to examine the 
feasibility of a community-based psychosocial interven -
tion for women using an adaptable, but manualized pro -
cess to balance the need to ensure fit with the need for 
replicability in existing research on psychosocial inter -
ventions [14]. The intervention was designed to be adapt -
able by specifying the components of the intervention 
that are fixed and those that are adaptable. The adaptable 
components are modifiable activities that can be substi -
tuted with more culturally or contextually relevant activi -
ties that are expected to achieve the same objective as the 
original activity. This study proposes to use a comparative 
effectiveness design that enables the intervention compo -
nents targeting social processes, which we hypothesize 
may require more tailoring to fit the socio-cultural con -
text, to be adaptable across settings while testing the inte -
gration of a standardized stress management component 
on psychosocial wellbeing for women in three diverse 
contexts. A comparative effectiveness design utilizing an 
equal attention control also minimizes the risk of infor -
mation bias that threatens the validity of many wait-list 
controlled trials of psychosocial interventions (e.g., due 
to placebo effects).
The proposed research aims to address major gaps in 
evidence on MHPSS interventions and incorporates pro -
cesses to promote local adaptability and fit without com -
promising the intervention rigor. A community-based 
approach that combines testable, yet locally adaptable 
components to improve mental health, coping, func -
tioning, social support and connectedness, and a sense 
of safety is needed to effectively promote the wellbeing 
of displaced women affected by chronic adversity and 
humanitarian emergencies.
Objectives
The purpose of the current protocol is to describe a feasi -
bility cluster randomized trial examining the integration 
of a scalable stress management intervention into Entre 
Nosotras (‘among/between us’), a community-based psy -
chosocial intervention for migrant and host community post-enrollment and qualitative interviews conducted with all facilitators and a subset of 70 study participants during 
the post-intervention follow-up period.
Discussion: Results from this feasibility trial will determine whether a multi-site cluster randomized comparative 
effectiveness trial of an adaptable community-based psychosocial intervention for migrant and host community 
women is relevant, acceptable, and feasible.

women in Ecuador and Panamá. The two study condi -
tions include (1) Entre Nosotras, a flexible and adapt -
able women’s group intervention designed to mobilize 
social support, strengthen community connectedness, 
and stimulate collective action to promote the safety and 
wellbeing of women (standard intervention); to (2) Entre 
Nosotras with an additional scalable stress management 
intervention (enhanced intervention). The objective of 
this feasibility trial is to examine the appropriateness, 
acceptability, feasibility, and safety of Entre Nosotras as 
well as the integrated stress management component and 
to collect data to inform the design of a definitive cluster 
randomized comparative effectiveness trial.
Methods/design
Study setting
Latin America has recently experienced increasing levels 
of forced migration due to political conflict, economic 
crises, climate-related events, community violence, and 
other factors. Panamá hosts refugees and migrants from 
the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salva -
dor), Nicaragua, Colombia, and Venezuela, among other 
countries [15]. Ecuador has long been a host country for 
displaced persons from Colombia and, more recently, 
Venezuela [16]. Migrants in these contexts face mental 
health and psychosocial problems, protection risks, and 
disrupted social and community support systems [17]. 
Gaps in the provision of psychosocial services, despite 
the high prevalence of psychosocial problems and threats 
to the safety and wellbeing of refugees and migrants, per -
sist in both countries and have been exacerbated due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic [18].
The proposed research will be conducted in three sites 
where the implementing partner, HIAS, an international 
non-governmental refugee protection organization [19], 
is currently providing services to migrants in Ecuador 
(Guayaquil and Tulcán) and Panamá (Panamá City area). 
Guayaquil is the largest city in Ecuador located in the 
coastal region and is a destination for many migrants 
from Colombia and Venezuela. Tulcán is located in the 
highlands of Ecuador on the border with Colombia and 
is primarily rural and often a temporary place of transit 
for migrants. Panamá City is the capital of Panamá and 
a destination for migrants, primarily from Central and 
South America. Many migrant communities live in peri-
urban areas surrounding Panamá City. The majority of 
migrants in Panamá and approximately half of migrants 
in Ecuador are female, most of whom are of reproduc -
tive age [20]. These three sites were selected because they 
have large and increasing populations of forced migrants 
and are diverse in terms of urbanicity, service delivery 
systems, populations, and other implementation factors.Study design
We will conduct a feasibility cluster randomized trial 
and mixed-methods process evaluation in nine com -
munities across the three study sites. The randomiza -
tion procedure will be stratified by site. Within each of 
the three sites, we will randomly allocate at least half of 
the communities to receive the integrated intervention 
(Entre Nosotras with a standardized stress management 
component) as compared to Entre Nosotras alone. A 
definitive trial with this design will allow us to exam -
ine whether adding a structured stress management 
component to Entre Nosotras enhances study outcomes 
beyond any effects derived from the Entre Nosotras  
intervention alone. This design also allows for flexibility 
in the specific activities within the community-based 
women’s group (Entre Nosotras) component to be tai -
lored to the local population and context in each of the 
three study sites and may serve as a model for future 
research balancing replicability and fit.
Sequence generation
Communities (clusters) will be allocated to study con -
dition using a random number generator in Stata by a 
researcher not affiliated with the project.
Allocation concealment mechanism
Since this is a cluster-randomized design there will be 
no allocation concealment mechanism.
Blinding
Only feasibility trial participants will be blinded to the 
conditions of the two arms.
Intervention
Entre Nosotras is a community- and strengths-based 
intervention designed to mobilize social support, 
strengthen community connectedness, and stimulate 
collective action to promote the safety and wellbeing 
of women. The intervention was selected and designed 
through a formative qualitative research and commu -
nity consultation process, which is described in detail 
within a forthcoming publication. Through this forma -
tive research process, we identified social problems 
(e.g., interpersonal violence, xenophobia and discrimi -
nation, social isolation, and loneliness) and psycho -
logical problems (e.g., emotional distress, sadness) to 
be among the most salient problems affecting migrant 
women in these communities. Through a commu -
nity consultation and design process, women recom -
mended a dynamic and interactive group intervention 
that mobilized social support and leveraged commu -
nity resources, while also providing skills to help cope 
Page 4 of 14 Greene et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:126 
with psychological distress and improve safety. With 
this information, we designed Entre Nosotras to target 
the social problems and processes that we discovered 
during this formative research and further identified a 
standardized, stress management intervention for cop -
ing with psychological distress that could be integrated 
to enhance the Entre Nosotras components.
The intervention includes five weekly sessions lasting 
approximately 2 to 3 h each delivered by female facilita -
tor pairs within the community. The intervention is based 
on the HIAS Mental Health and Psychosocial Support 
Curriculum [21], principles of Psychological First Aid 
[22–24], and the Community Action Cycle [25], which 
is intended to generate community-led problem solv -
ing around priority issues affecting participants’ wellbe -
ing. The sessions include a series of fixed and modifiable 
components. The fixed components of the intervention 
are the scaffolding of the intervention that introduce the 
topics for each session and guide the facilitator through 
the session (see Table 1). These fixed components include 
specific objectives, brief facilitator scripts, and tips for 
the facilitator, including possible adaptations for remote 
delivery. The modifiable components make up the major -
ity of the intervention and include suggested activi -
ties that align with the session objectives. The program 
implementers/managers are encouraged to substitute 
these suggested activities for ones that are culturally rel -
evant and expected to achieve the specified objectives. 
This adaptable manual is designed to maintain consist -
ency around the objectives and concepts that are covered 
within the sessions (i.e., function), while allowing for var -
iability in how these concepts are expressed and engaged 
with in groups (i.e., form).For example, in Latin America there is a long history of 
using theater to generate collective discussion and action 
around social issues [26]. In session 4, Entre Nosotras 
uses this ‘theater of the oppressed’ methodology to gen -
erate strategies to support women who are affected by 
family problems/violence, community tension, and xeno -
phobia. However, in other contexts, there may be more 
culturally appropriate approaches to generate discussion 
and collective action on sensitive social issues, which can 
be used to substitute the theater of the oppressed activity. 
Additionally, within this study there were notable differ -
ences in the intervention across the study sites. For exam -
ple, in Ecuador, the intervention concludes with a pamba 
mesa, which is a traditional communal meal that symbol -
izes social solidarity. In Panamá, the final session closes 
with the participants sharing a small gift (e.g., crafts, 
bracelets) made for another member of the group along 
with a discussion of what they gained from the interven -
tion and how they plan to sustain the group. They are 
also invited to bring something to share with the group 
that, similarly to pamba mesa, may include food. Each of 
these activities shares the same function (e.g., reinforcing 
social connectedness and sustained group identity), but 
applies a form that fits the local context and traditions.
The stress management component that we have inte -
grated into the Entre Nosotras intervention for the 
experimental condition is based on the World Health 
Organization’s Doing What Matters in Times of Stress 
intervention [27], a self-guided stress management inter -
vention that is intended to provide practical skills to 
help people cope with psychological distress. It includes 
an illustrated guide along with optional audio exer -
cises that are based on Acceptance and Commitment

Therapy (ACT), a type of cognitive behavioral therapy 
that incorporates mindfulness approaches to develop 
skills for managing difficult thoughts and feelings [27, 
28]. Doing What Matters in Times of Stress includes five 
skills-based tools: (1) grounding; (2) unhooking from dif -
ficult thoughts; (3) acting on your values; (4) being kind; 
and (5) making room [27]. As shown in Table  1, we dis -
tributed activities to support the development of these 
skills across the five sessions. Within the sessions, the 
facilitators provide an overview of the skill(s) and the 
participants practice the skill at least once during the ses -
sion with the support of audio exercises developed and 
made publicly available by the World Health Organiza -
tion in thirteen languages (https:// cdn. who. int/ media/ 
docs/ defau lt-  source/ mental- health/ doing-  what- matte  
rs- audio- audio- links- in- diffe rent- langu  ages. pdf? sfvrsn= 
1f449 f8d_ 16). Each session ends with homework that 
involves setting a goal for practicing the skill, which is 
revisited during the check-in at the beginning of the fol -
lowing session.
Participants and procedures
Study eligibility
The target population for this study includes Spanish-
speaking adults who identify as women, reside in the 
study community, and are willing and able to engage 
in the intervention. We aimed to recruit a mix of both 
migrant and host community women. We plan to recruit 
70–80 women from each of the 3 sites (n = 220 women 
total; n = 20–40 women per community) into the feasi -
bility trial. The eligibility criteria are as follows:
Inclusion criteria
We will include adult (18+ years) women residing in the 
study community who speak and understand Spanish.
Exclusion criteria
We will exclude participants if they report severe psy -
chological distress (Kessler-6 score > 13), disclose sui -
cidal thoughts or feelings, or display signs of cognitive 
impairment that would prevent participation in a group 
psychosocial intervention during the screening interview. 
Participants who are excluded for these reasons will be 
referred to appropriate services within HIAS or through 
partner implementing organizations.
A subset of participants from the feasibility trial (n = 
10 per community, or until we reach saturation) as well 
as all intervention facilitators will be selected to complete 
qualitative semi-structured interviews after the inter -
vention period. Participants will be purposively selected 
using maximum variation sampling to represent a range 
in level of engagement, level of distress, among other factors that emerge as important contributors to imple -
mentation success.
Recruitment, screening, and assessment procedures
All participants will be recruited through referral from 
HIAS staff, community outreach workers, and commu -
nity leaders. Interested individuals will be connected by 
phone or in person with members of the research team, 
who will provide further information about the study. 
After providing further information, research assistants 
will invite interested individuals to complete a brief 
screening assessment. Verbal consent must be provided 
prior to commencing the screening. We will obtain writ -
ten informed consent from eligible participants prior 
to administering a baseline assessment. Within 2 weeks 
of the baseline assessment, participants will attend 
the first session of the Entre Nosotras group to which 
their community was randomly allocated (enhanced 
vs. standard condition). Follow-up assessments will be 
conducted by a research assistant within 1-week post-
intervention and 5 weeks post-intervention. Facilitators 
and participants selected to participate in the process 
evaluation will be invited to participate in a qualitative 
interview occurring within the post-intervention follow-
up period (i.e., between end of intervention and 5 weeks 
post-intervention).
Assessments are designed to be conducted remotely or 
in person, depending on COVID-19 policies and recom -
mendations. Participants who complete the assessments 
in person will be provided with reimbursement for their 
transportation costs and a take-away snack as an incen -
tive for their participation. Participants who complete the 
assessments remotely will be provided with airtime or 
connectivity reimbursement for their participation.
Outcomes
This feasibility trial aims to assess the appropriateness, 
acceptability, feasibility, and safety of implementing and 
evaluating Entre Nosotras, including when integrated 
with a stress management component, for migrant and 
host community women in Ecuador and Panamá. These 
outcomes will determine whether the study should pro -
gress to a definitive cluster-randomized comparative 
effectiveness trial and whether any research design or 
intervention adaptations are needed. These feasibil -
ity trial outcomes will be assessed using indicators and 
means of verification that are measured at the partici -
pant, service, and implementation level [29]. Table  2 
details the outcomes, indicators that will determine pro -
gression to the definitive trial, means of verification, and 
assessment time points.

a Fidelity assessment includes a self-administered assessment completed by the facilitator pair at the end of each session as well as an external assessment completed by a member of the research team at two or more 
sessions per group. Six items from the ENACT that were relevant for a non-clinical, group psychosocial intervention (non-verbal communication and active listening; verbal communication; rapport building and self-
disclosure; exploration, interpretation and normalization of feelings; demonstration of empathy, warmth, and genuineness; elicitation of feedback when providing advice, suggestions, and recommendations) were 
selected to assess facilitator competencies during the facilitator training and are also evaluated by a member of the research team at the 2+ sessions during which they administer the external fidelity assessment

Participant -level measures
Eligible participants will complete assessments admin -
istered by a member of the research team at baseline, 
within 1-week post-intervention, and 5 weeks post-
intervention. These assessments include the following 
measures that will be evaluated for their suitability as 
participant effectiveness outcomes in a definitive trial. 
We used existing Spanish translations when available. For 
measures that required translation, we had a bilingual 
member of our team with experience working with the 
target population prepare the initial translation, which 
were then reviewed and piloted to ensure their compre -
hensibility in the local context:
• Psychosocial wellbeing will be measured using the 
9-item Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) [30]. The 
personal wellbeing index includes several subscales. 
Most relevant to this study are the community con -
nectedness and sense of safety subscales. The Spanish 
version of the full PWI has been validated in Spain 
where it displayed adequate internal construct valid -
ity and excellent internal consistency (α = 0.88) [31]. 
While no validation studies of the adult PWI have 
been conducted in Latin America, the adolescent 
version has been found to display good psychometric 
properties [32]. Furthermore, an assessment of the 
PWI’s performance in a multi-country study found 
evidence of configural measurement invariance and 
partial metric and scalar invariance across 26 coun -
tries [33]. The PWI has also demonstrated good 
internal consistency among refugee and migrant 
populations (α = 0.83) [34].
• Psychological distress will be measured using the 
6-item Kessler-6 [35]. The Kessler-6 has been used 
as a measure of psychological distress in Panamá and 
Ecuador, including during the COVID-19 pandemic 
[36, 37]. Although it has not been validated spe -
cifically in Ecuador or Panamá, it has demonstrated 
good psychometric properties in Latin America as 
well as in refugee and migrant populations [34].
• Coping will be measured using the 28-item Brief 
COPE [38]. The Spanish Brief COPE has been used 
to measure coping in previous studies in Latin Amer -
ica and has been found to be associated with other 
constructs of interest to this study (e.g., psychologi -
cal wellbeing, social support) [39, 40]. Psychometric 
analyses of the Spanish version of the Brief COPE 
identified a unique factor structure that. For example, 
Morán and colleagues identified a single factor that 
includes both the emotional and instrumental sup -
port items, a single factor that included the active 
coping and planning items, and did not identify an 
acceptance subscale [41].• Social support will be measured using the 3-item 
Oslo Social Support Scale (OSS-3) [42]. The Span -
ish OSS-3 has been applied in Spain [43], but we did 
not find evidence that it has been previously used 
in Latin America. It has also been used in research 
among immigrant and refugee populations and found 
to correlate with psychological distress [44, 45].
• Functional impairment will be measured using 
the 12-item World Health Organization Disability 
Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) [46]. The WHO -
DAS has been previously applied in Ecuador in clini -
cal samples of people with psychiatric and neuro -
logical disorders [47, 48]. Validation studies among 
Ecuadoran populations have reported good internal 
consistency (α = 0.81) and high convergent validity 
of the WHODAS when correlated with other meas -
ures of disability or mental health problems [47].
Service -level measures
We will evaluate several service-level outcomes through 
routine monitoring including participant engagement 
and retention, safety, and usability.
• Participant engagement and retention will be assessed 
using routine session monitoring forms completed by 
the facilitators capturing attendance and notes from 
each intervention session.
• Safety will be evaluated as the number of adverse 
events detected by the research team and reported 
on an ongoing basis to study investigators and insti -
tutional review boards throughout the course of 
the feasibility trial. We will also inquire about safety 
through semi-structured interviews with facilitators 
during the process evaluation.
• Usability, which is defined as ‘the extent to which an 
intervention can be used to achieve specified goals 
with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction, ’ using 
the 10-item Intervention Usability Scale [49]. The 
facilitators will complete the Intervention Usability 
Scale in relation to their experience delivering Entre 
Nosotras after the final session of the intervention. 
The Intervention Usability Scale was adapted from 
the commonly used System Usability Scale [50, 51], 
and has displayed a two-factor structure measuring 
whether a psychosocial intervention is (1) learnable; 
and (2) usable [49].
Implementation-level measures
We will evaluate a range of implementation out -
comes pertaining to both the intervention and research 
procedures.
Page 10 of 14 Greene et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:126 
Appropriateness of intervention and research procedures
• We will consider the proportion of those screened 
who are eligible and sensitivity to change of our study 
outcome measures as indicators of appropriateness 
(i.e., how well aligned our eligibility criteria and out -
come measure selection are to the profile and needs 
the target population).
• We also consider intervention fidelity as an indicator 
of appropriateness. As members of the community 
trained to deliver this adaptable and flexible interven -
tion, the facilitators may deviate from the manualized 
intervention to improve the fit of the intervention 
to the participant’s needs. Intervention fidelity will 
be evaluated using two methods. A member of our 
research team will observe at least two sessions and 
externally assess fidelity using a checklist that indi -
cates whether each activity within a session was com -
pleted well, could be improved, or was not imple -
mented. At the end of each session, the facilitator 
pair reviews the session and for each activity docu -
ments whether it was completed and, if so, whether it 
could be improved; any difficulties they experienced 
with the activity that may have influenced whether 
and how it was implemented (e.g., fit/appropriate -
ness); things that worked well (if implemented); or 
ways in which the activity could be improved.
• During the process evaluation, facilitators and partic -
ipants will be asked open-ended questions related to 
the appropriateness of the intervention and research 
procedures. These questions will be informed by the 
Johns Hopkins Dissemination and Implementation 
Science Measure [52].
Acceptability of intervention and research procedures
• Acceptability will be measured by asking participants 
and facilitators open-ended questions about their 
satisfaction with the intervention, whether they liked 
attending or delivering Entre Nosotras sessions, and 
whether the components of the intervention made 
sense and were useful during the process evaluation 
interviews. We will also ask about safety as an indica -
tor of poor acceptability.
Feasibility of intervention and research procedures
• Feasibility of research procedures will include exam -
ining the rate of recruitment, whether randomization 
produced balanced groups within site, study attri -tion, and protocol deviations assessed using routine 
study monitoring forms.
• We will examine whether contamination occurred 
using data from the externally-rated fidelity assess -
ments. We will consider any application of Doing 
What Matters in Times of Stress material in the 
standard Entre Nosotras intervention or the omission 
of Doing What Matters in Times of Stress material 
in the enhanced Entre Nosotras intervention as evi -
dence of contamination.
• We will explore the construct validity, internal con -
sistency, and sensitivity to change of measures of psy -
chosocial wellbeing, psychological distress, coping, 
social support, and functioning to determine whether 
they may serve as suitable outcome measures for the 
definitive trial.
• Feasibility of intervention procedures will focus on 
whether facilitators are able to achieve the compe -
tencies necessary to deliver the Entre Nosotras inter -
vention. Facilitator competency will be assessed by 
a member of the research team at the end of train -
ing and during the sessions that are observed for the 
fidelity assessments using a subset of items from the 
Enhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic fac -
tors (ENACT) rating scale. Specifically, we selected six 
items from the ENACT that are relevant to the non-
clinical nature of the Entre Nosotras intervention: (1) 
non-verbal communication and active listening: eye 
contact, facial expression, body language, and gestures; 
(2) verbal communication skills: open-ended questions, 
summarizing, and clarifying statements; 3) rapport 
building and self-disclosure; (4) exploration, interpreta -
tion, and normalization of feelings; (5) demonstration 
of empathy, warmth, and genuineness; and (6) elicita -
tion of feedback when providing advice, suggestions, 
and recommendations. These items are measured on 
a 3-point scale indicating whether the facilitator needs 
improvement, partially demonstrated this competency, 
or demonstrated this competency well. Each facilitator 
in the pair is rated separately by the external rater.
• During the process evaluation, facilitators will be asked 
open-ended questions about the feasibility of imple -
menting Entre Nosotras including general intervention 
feasibility, adoptability within the study contexts, and 
potential for scalability and sustainability. Participants 
and facilitators will also be asked to identify barriers 
and facilitators to implementation as well as strategies 
for overcoming barriers and leveraging facilitators.
Sample size
At least two groups (range 2–4) will be implemented per 
study community. We aim to enroll up to 220 women 
Page 11 of 14
 Greene et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:126 
 
(10 women per group). A summary of the target sample 
size (participants, groups) by study site and community 
is provided in Table  3. This sample size is comparable 
to prior feasibility trials of group psychosocial interven -
tions and will enable us to sufficiently pilot the study 
procedures and evaluate the relevance, acceptability, and 
feasibility of the intervention and trial design [53, 54]. 
A sample size of 220, is expected to provide sufficient 
power to evaluate the construct validity and internal con -
sistency of the study outcome measures in a confirma -
tory factor analysis under most scenarios (e.g., number of 
parameters and magnitude of loadings) [55].
Data management
All data entered electronically will be range checked to 
ensure valid values. Any manually entered data will be 
double entered by two independent research assistants 
and then range checked for quality. Qualitative data will 
be audio recorded and then transcribed by a research 
assistant. All data are coded (de-identified) and stored 
on a secure server hosted by HIAS to which only the 
research team has access.
Planned analyses
Quantitative data analysis
Descriptive analyses of baseline data We will use 
descriptive statistics to characterize quantitative indica -
tors of relevance, acceptability, and most indicators of 
feasibility. Descriptive statistics will include mean with 
standard deviation and/or median with interquartile 
range for continuous variables. Categorical variables will 
be displayed using frequencies and proportions. We will 
explore the distribution of demographic and psychoso -
cial characteristics across the study communities and 
intervention conditions to characterize heterogeneity 
across sites and identify any major baseline imbalances 
between study conditions. We will calculate effect sizes 
to explore the magnitude of baseline differences between study conditions (Cohen’s d for continuous variables, Φ 
for categorical variables) and estimate the significance of 
this difference using mixed effects models accounting for 
clustering within communities and sites.
Psychometric analyses of baseline data To evaluate the 
performance of participant-level outcome measure we 
will estimate the internal consistency, internal construct 
validity, and external construct validity (i.e., convergent) 
of these outcome measures. Internal consistency will be 
estimated using Cronbach’s alpha. Internal construct 
validity will be evaluated through confirmatory factor 
analysis and examination of model fit using Compara -
tive Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), root mean 
square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standard -
ized root mean squared residual (SRMR). We will esti -
mate the correlation among these participant outcome 
measures to investigator external construct (i.e., conver -
gent) validity.
Psychometric analyses of baseline and follow‑up 
data  We will estimate sensitivity to change in par -
ticipant outcome measures using mixed effects models 
within individuals, communities, and sites (i.e., within-
group changes).
Qualitative data analysis
Process evaluation interviews will be transcribed and 
then coded and analyzed in Spanish using the Constant 
Comparative Method [56]. Within the primary domains 
of relevance, acceptability, and feasibility, the research 
team will develop concepts from the data through an 
iterative coding process. After a set of interviews, the 
research team will review and code the transcripts. 
They will discuss emerging themes and identified gaps 
to be further explored in the next set of interviews. This 
cycle will continue until the interviews are complete and 
the researchers agree they have achieved theoretical

saturation [57]. The research assistants will then use 
the final codebook and review all transcripts to identify 
any overlooked concepts that contribute to themes that 
emerged at later stages of data collection and analysis.
Ethics
All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Columbia Univer -
sity Irving Medical Center (USA), Universidad de San -
tander (Panamá) and Universidad San Francisco de Quito 
(Ecuador).
Informed consent
Informed consent will be obtained by research assis -
tants who completed training in human subjects 
research ethics prior to beginning the study [58]. Par -
ticipants must provide verbal consent prior to screen -
ing. If eligible, participants then must provide written 
consent for enrollment prior to beginning the baseline 
assessment. Participants who are selected to com -
plete the additional process evaluation interview are 
asked again to provide consent, including permis -
sion to audio record the interview. At all phases of the 
informed consent process and the research study, par -
ticipants will be reminded that refusal to participate 
will not impact their ability to access services through 
HIAS or other agencies.
Harms
Data collection may be associated with minimal emo -
tional discomfort due to the discussion of sensitive topics 
such as protection risks and psychosocial problems. We 
do not expect that the intervention or the assessments 
will lead to significant increases in distress. However, 
members of our research team are trained to identify 
acute signs of distress and to respond in a supportive 
manner and/or provide them with referral resources. 
At least one member of each of our research teams is a 
clinical psychologist and able to manage emergency situ -
ations. If participants require additional mental health or 
protection services, they will be referred to HIAS’ pro -
gram staff in these sectors, respectively. HIAS has exist -
ing referral protocols in place to manage protection risks 
and mental health challenges.
We will adhere to local and national guidance regard -
ing social distancing when completing the interviews and 
will not implement any in-person activities that do not 
comply with COVID-19 guidance. Participants who com -
plete interviews remotely will be provided with a top-up 
on their airtime/data to cover the costs of communica -
tion during the interview. Participants who complete 
interviews in person will be reimbursed for transporta -
tion costs and provided a small snack.Confidentiality
The intervention sessions will be conducted in groups, 
which increases the risk of breaching confidentiality. 
Facilitators will be trained to emphasize the importance 
of not sharing information about other women with 
people who are not part of the group. To preserve the 
confidentiality of women, we will ensure that efforts are 
made to protect the data, that the identifiable informa -
tion collected is minimal, and that data collection forms 
are coded and do not include personally identifiable 
information.
Post‑trial care
If we do not detect any risk or harms associated with the 
stress management component of the intervention, par -
ticipants in the standard Entre Nosotras condition will 
be given a copy of the Doing What Matters in Times of 
Stress guide at the end of the intervention period. Over -
all, the trial is minimal risk. Referrals will be made to 
HIAS services, as needed, throughout the study period.
Protocol amendments
There are currently no protocol amendments to report. 
Any future amendments will be reported to the IRBs and 
clini caltr  ials. gov .

Discussion
The results of this feasibility trial will be used to deter -
mine whether we should progress to a definitive, fully 
powered trial evaluating the effectiveness and imple -
mentation of the Entre Nosotras intervention with and 
without a stress management component. Furthermore, 
this feasibility trial will provide preliminary evidence of 
the feasibility of using comparative effectiveness trials to 
optimize community-based psychosocial interventions in 
complex settings. If there are qualitative or quantitative 
indicators that suggest problems with relevance, accept -
ability, and/or feasibility of the intervention or study 
design, we will modify these procedures. We will also 
examine the validity and reliability of measures of psy -
chosocial wellbeing, psychological distress, coping, social 
support, and functioning in Ecuador and Panamá as well 
as among migrant and host community women.
This feasibility trial and potential definitive trial to 
follow will advance the evidence for community-based 
psychosocial interventions in humanitarian settings. 
Consistent methodological challenges related to evalu -
ating these interventions reveal the need for innova -
tive interventions and evaluation approaches to fill this 
gap in evidence. The Entre Nosotras intervention aims 
Page 13 of 14
 Greene et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:126 
 
to test an adaptable intervention model to which cul -
turally specific and standardized components can be 
integrated to fit the population needs and operational 
context. The comparative effectiveness design may 
provide a foundation for future studies to disentangle 
the mechanisms by which specific intervention com -
ponents improve psychological and social outcomes 
through adaptive and optimization study designs. Fur -
thermore, this flexible intervention design and imple -
mentation approach may enable tailoring to different 
settings and understudied populations (e.g., gender, 
racial, and ethnic minorities) who may be underrep -
resented in the current study [59– 61]. Entre Nosotras  
represents a novel, adaptable community-based psy -
chosocial intervention that aims to empower migrant 
and host communities to collectively generate strate -
gies and identify resources to improve the social and 
psychological dimensions of wellbeing among women 
in their community.
