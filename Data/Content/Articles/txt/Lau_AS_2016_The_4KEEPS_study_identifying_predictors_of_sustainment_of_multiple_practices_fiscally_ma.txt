The 4KEEPS study: identifying predictors of
sustainment of multiple practices fiscally
mandated in children ’s mental health
services
Anna S. Lau1*and Lauren Brookman-Frazee2,3
Abstract
Background: Research to date has largely focused on predictors of adoption and initial implementation of
evidence-based practices (EBPs), yet sustained implementation is crucial to deliver a return on investments in
dissemination. Furthermore, most studies focus on single EBPs, limiting opportunities to study the fit between
practice characteristics EBPs and implementation contexts.
Methods/design: This observational study will characterize implementation sustainment and identify organizational
and therapist characteristics that predict sustainment of multiple practices being implemented within a fiscal mandate
in the largest public mental health system in the USA. Specific aims are to (1) characterize sustainment outcomes
(volume/penetration, EBP concordant care); (2) use mixed methods to characterize inner context (agency- and
therapist-level) factors and early implementation conditions; and (3) identify inner context factors and early
implementation conditions that predict sustainment outcomes. This study will undertake original data collection and
analysis of existing data sources to achieve its aims. Archived reports and documents will be used to characterize early
implementation conditions in 102 agencies. Administrative claims data will be used to characterize volume and
penetration outcomes over 8 years. Therapist and program manager surveys will be administered to characterize
sustained EBP concordant care and inner context determinants of sustainment. An in-depth study in a subset of
agencies will yield interview data and recordings of treatment sessions for validation of the EBP concordant care scale.
Discussion: This project will yield new understanding of whether and how multiple EBPs can be sustained in public
mental health systems undergoing a policy-driven community implementation effort. We will produce generalizable
models for characterizing sustainment, including feasible and flexible measurement of practice across multiple EBPs.
The findings will inform the development of implementation interventions to promote sustained delivery of EBPs to
maximize their public health impact.
Keywords: Children ’s mental health, Fiscally driven implementation
Background
Documented quality gaps between usual care (UC) and
evidence-based practices (EBPs) [1, 2] have prompted
large-scale implementation efforts in mental health
(MH) systems [3 –7]. Mandating EBPs in public managed
care in children ’s MH services began with the reform of
services in Hawaii ’s Department of Health following a1999 consent decree [8]. By 2008, 90 % of state MH au-
thorities reported strategies to install EBPs; 12 states had
mandated the use of EBPs in public MH systems, with 8
states promoting, supporting, or requiring specific prac-
tices statewide [9]. These costly efforts provide natural
laboratories to identify determinants of the sustainment
of EBPs, an understudied topic in implementation sci-
ence [10]. The Knowledge Exchange on Evidence-based
Practice Sustainment (4KEEPS) study (R01 MH100134;

the extent to which such inve stments result in sustained
reach and use of multiple EBPs and identify determinants
of sustainment that can be leveraged in novel implementa-
tion interventions. With few exceptions, most studies have
focused on implementation out comes of a single interven-
tion. Yet MH systems are unlikely to implement a single
intervention as patient needs vary [3, 11, 12]. Little is

Context of current study (see Additional file 1:
History of Developments leading to the LACDMH
PEI Implementation)
The Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health
(LACDMH) is the nation ’s largest county MH depart-
ment, serving, on average, more than 250,000 county
residents of all ages every year [13]. In 2010, LACDMH
launched the Prevention and Early Intervention trans-
formation with training and implementation support for
an initial set of six evidence-based/informed practices
(hereafter referred to as practices) to address a range of
prevalent youth MH problems, including Cognitive Be-
havioral Interventions for Trauma in Schools (CBITS),
Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), Managing and
Adapting Practices (MAP), Seeking Safety (SS), Trauma-
Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT), and
Triple P Positive Parenting Program (Triple P). Therap-
ist trainings commenced in May, 2010, and in fiscal year
2010 –2011, over 32,000 children and transition age
youth were served in Prevention and Early Intervention
(PEI) programs [14]. The timing of the current study
relative to the maturity of PEI transformation permits
examination of practice sustainment up to 8 years after
adoption.
We used the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation,
and Sustainment (EPIS) framework [15] to frame the PEI
transformation timeline and variables examined in the
current study (see online resources Fig. 1). The EPIS
model outlines four phases of implementation and high-
lights potential predictors of outcomes in the outer (e.g.,
funding, policy, organizational networks) and inner (e.g.,
organizational, leadership, therapist characteristics) con-
texts. Given the nature of the PEI transformation, “outer
context ”variables are shared across agencies and thera-
pists, permitting us to isolate key aspects of the inner con-
text (organizational and therapist variables) central in
socio-technical models of implementation [16].
Focus on sustainment
Sustainment is defined as the extent to which a newly
implemented practice is maintained or institutionalized
within a service setting ’s ongoing, stable operations [17].
Stirman et al. [18] reviewed 125 studies examining sus-
tainment across service settings and interventions andhighlighted a general lack of methodological rigor. Rec-
ommendations included developing measures of mul-
tiple sustainment outcomes, assessing sustainment over
years rather than at a single time point, and developing
methods to measure intervention adaptation that may
occur to achieve sustainment. Thus, 4KEEPS fills im-
portant gaps in the literature through long-term post-
adoption follow-up, characterizing and understanding
the impact of naturalistic adaptations of practices, and
examining multiple indicators of sustainment of multiple
practices within a “marketplace ”of implementation.
It is essential to consider multiple sustainment out-
comes jointly. One such sustainment outcome is pene-
tration, defined as the integration of a practice within a
service setting. It can be measured as the number of eli-
gible individuals who use/deliver a treatment, divided by
the number of eligible individuals [17]. An important
limitation of indexing a penetration ratio alone is that it
does not track the absolute scale of an implementation
effort over time. Moreover, the denominators used to
calculate penetration rates vary over time with changes
in the workforce and system policies. Therefore, in
addition to penetration, we assess volume of practices
delivered over time in raw units of numbers of agencies,
therapists, children, and units of service to characterize
the scale of implementation impact.
Use of system administrative data provides one
method of measuring penetration and volume and aligns
with calls for use of these data to understand practice
patterns and inform implementation efforts [19, 20].
However, by itself, penetration/volume of a practice
within a workforce is insufficient to determine the main-
tained success of the implementation. Continued deliv-
ery with poor integrity to the practice model is unlikely
to produce the expected value of the practice [21]. Like-
wise, sustained practice integrity has little impact if few
therapists persist in implementation. Thus, indicators of
practice penetration/volume and practice integrity are
essential in the study of sustainment.
Inner context determinants of sustainment
outcomes
Within the PEI transformation, outer contextual factors
are held relatively constant across agencies, as the fiscal
mandate, contract conditions, reimbursement policies,
and revenue stream apply uniformly to all agencies. As
such, we will focus on identifying determinants of sus-
tainment within the inner context.
Organizational factors
Over 100 agencies are contracted with LACDMH to
deliver at least one of the six practices of interest. These
agencies vary widely in size, structure, and resources
to support implementation which creates a uniqueLau and Brookman-Frazee Implementation Science  (2016) 11:31 Page 2 of 8
opportunity to examine agency-level determinants of
practice sustainment. Although research indicates that
organization and therapist-level factors influence attitudes
toward and adoption of EBPs [22 –24], little research links
these factors to sustainment. Organizational support for
practices predicts adoption and initial implementation
[23, 25], and organizational climate is associated with pro-
vider willingness to deliver practices [24, 26]. Specifically,
leadership support, quality assurance structures, and staff
incentives [27] predict positive therapist attitudes [28, 29]
as well as workforce outcomes including lower turnover
[23, 30]. Beyond early implementation phases, 4KEEPS
will apply mixed methods to examine these associations
with long-term sustained implementation of multiple
practices at the therapist and agency levels.
Therapist factors
Since 2010, approximately 8500 therapists have delivered
at least one of the six practices of interest. Therapist
background factors have been shown to influence both
attitudes toward EBP [22], and therapist attitudes have
been linked to practice behavior [31]. A survey con-
ducted soon after the PEI transformation revealed that
significant variance in therapist attitudes were explained
by practice type and that practice-specific ratings of
intervention appeal predicted concurrent therapist re-
ports of EBP use [32]. 4KEEPS will prospectively exam-
ine relations between dimensions of therapist attitudes
and sustained use of practices over time as indexed by
administrative, self-report, and observational data.
There is growing attention to the role of therapist adap-
tations to practices and their implications for implementa-
tion outcomes [18, 33, 34]. Although it is often implicitly
expected that practices be delivered with efficacy trial ad-
herence standards, this is at odds with contingencies in
UC settings [35]. Therapists commonly raise the concernthat practices may not fit the needs of clients seen in UC
and must be adapted, particularly for ethnic minority
groups not represented in controlled trials [36 –39]. Ther-
apists may adapt by reframing interventions, incorporat-
ing techniques or components to promote acceptance or
address group-specific needs [40]. Such investments in tai-
loring practices may increase commitment to delivering
the EBP long term [41, 42]. On the other hand, inappro-
priate modifications or omissions represent drift [34]. It is
unclear the extent to which community therapists engage
in adaptations and whether they are consistent or incon-
sistent with practice integrity.
The overall objectives of 4KEEPS project are to
characterize sustainment outcomes and identify inner
context factors that predict the sustained penetration
and use of multiple practices delivered through a fiscal
mandate in children ’s MH services. Supplemental aims
address client-level determinants of implementation and
potential racial disparities (see Additional file 2: 4KEEPS
Disparities Supplement Aims).
Aim One: Characterize sustainment outcomes of six
practices within the PEI transformation
EBP concordant care Fidelity refers to the degree to
which an intervention is delivered as intended by the pro-
gram developers [43]. Fidelity to EBP is considered a cen-
tral implementation outcome [17]. However, traditional
fidelity measures may not be appropriate in the current
study context. Assessments of therapist practice must be
both effective and efficient to track the success of
implementation efforts large enough to impact public
health [21, 44, 45] .Direct observation, the gold standard
in evaluating fidelity in controlled trials, is not feasible
in large-scale UC implementation. Moreover, measuring
fidelity across interventions that vary in content and focus
presents a challenge when multiple EBPs are adopted.
Fig. 1 Applying Aarons et al. ’s [15] EPIS Framework to the LACDMH Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) timelineLau and Brookman-Frazee Implementation Science  (2016) 11:31 Page 3 of 8
Therefore, we assess a related construct to characterize
sustained use of a practice —EBP concordant care. We
depart from protocol-specific fidelity measures that in-
clude features specific to manualized protocols that do
not necessarily generalize across interventions within a
family of treatments shown to be effective for ameliorat-
ing a MH condition. EBP concordant care indexes the
degree to which a therapist ’s practice resembles the es-
sential strategies one would expect within an evidence-
based protocol for a given problem focus. Drawing from
established tools used to characterize UC therapist prac-
tice, we developed the EBP Concordant Care Assessment
(ECCA). The ECCA will provide a common metric to
assess the extent to which a therapist delivers practices
considered “essential ”in EBPs for six major child MH
targets: anxiety, depression, conduct problems, trauma,
attachment problems, and substance use. This measure
is completed by therapists and will be validated against
observational coding.
Practice volume and penetration
Administrative claims data from LACDMH will be used
to measure the volume and penetration of the six prac-
tices over time using a variety of units of analysis from
FY10-11 through FY17-18. The volume of any given
practice is defined as the numbers of agencies continu-
ing to be reimbursed for the practice, therapists continu-
ing to claim to the practice, unique clients served by the
practice, and units of services being provided within
each practice. Within PEI, providers must submit claims
to be reimbursed for any service rendered and each
claim must specify the practice. Penetration is calculated
as the volume (claims, clients, therapists, agencies) for a
given practice divided by the total volume across prac-
tices. Claims data will index volume and penetration for
8 years from the outset of the PEI transformation.
Aim two: Use mixed methods to characterize inner context
factors and early implementation conditions that
potentially predict EBP sustainment
The ultimate goal of this study is to identify factors asso-
ciated with the long-term sustainment of multiple prac-
tices introduced in a major system reform toward EBP
implementation. Challenges with this goal include the
potentially time-varying nature of inner context factors
and the time period of the study (i.e., assessing these fac-
tors after initial implementation). Thus, we use a multi-
method approach including repeated measures of poten-
tially time-varying inner context factors and analyses of
archival data on early implementation conditions. We
apply a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach
since their combined use provides a better understand-
ing of the implementation context than either approach
alone [46]. Qualitative methods (interviews and archivaldocument review) are used to obtain in-depth under-
standing of the conditions associated with success in
sustainment while quantitative methods (survey
methods) test hypotheses based on existing models of
implementation. The key constructs of interest include
agency-level organizational factors (Agency Structure,
Climate, Leadership, and Early Implementation Condi-
tions) and therapist-level attitudes toward and adapta-
tions to practices.
Aim Three: Identify inner context and early implementation
conditions that determine sustainment outcomes
We will use multi-level modeling to examine predictors
of volume/penetration trajectories and end point esti-
mates of therapist delivery of EBP concordant care. We
will examine whether individual determinants interact to
impact sustainment outcomes and whether determinants
differ based on the type of sustainment outcome (i.e.,
EBP concordant care vs. volume/penetration).
Methods/design
Existing data sources
Claims data
Administrative claims data will index PEI-reimbursed
claims for the six practices from the outset of the reform
in FY 2009 –2010 through the end of the study in FY
2018 –2019. Data obtained from 2009 –2014 (19 fiscal
quarters) have yielded over 2.3 million psychotherapy
claims for more than 87,000 unique child and transition
age youth (TAY) clients provided by more than 8500
MH clinicians within 94 agencies (Brookman-Frazee et
al., under review). Gross volume and penetration will be
calculated at each level (claims, client, therapist, agency)
per fiscal quarter for each practice. Claims data for each
practice may have up to a four-level structure with
claims nested within fiscal quarter, nested within thera-
pists, within agencies. Because some therapists will tran-
sition across agencies within LACDMH over time,
cross-classified models will be use to account for mul-
tiple membership nesting [47]. Claims will also be
indexed at the therapist level to characterize the volume
of claims per therapist for each practice relative to their
total claims across practices.
Document extraction
Since the study commenced years after the PEI trans-
formation launched, prospective assessment of early im-
plementation conditions was not possible. However,
readiness for implementation and early implementation
integrity are two factors that may predict our sustain-
ment outcomes of interest. As such, we will extract in-
formation from detailed documentation generated by
Technical Assistance Site Visits that were carried out by
the LACDMH from June 2012 through December 2013.Lau and Brookman-Frazee Implementation Science  (2016) 11:31 Page 4 of 8
The purpose of the visits was to support agencies in
claiming procedures and to assess implementation mile-
stones (e.g., therapist training, instantiation of supervi-
sion/consultation/fidelity monitoring, outcome tracking).
Agencies completed a Pre-Site Visit Questionnaire
(PSVQ) prior to site visits which included a 3-h meeting
led by LACDMH staff and agency program managers,
with supervisors, and therapists. Site Visit Reports
(SVRs) summarizing discussions were produced within
3 weeks of each visit. The PSVQs and SVRs will be
coded to provide a measure of early implementation
conditions at the agency level.
Original data collection
Surveys
Survey data will be collected from therapists and pro-
gram managers across agencies contracted to provide at
least one of the six practices of interest to children or
transition age youth. Therapists currently billing for psy-
chotherapy services for at least one of them are eligible.
We will enumerate our therapist sample by contacting
program managers at each contracted agency to request
email contacts for all eligible therapists. Participants will
be invited to participate with a personalized link to the
online survey via email. The sampling frame for the sur-
vey in fiscal year 2013 –2014 included 102 agencies; we
anticipate an agency-level response rate of 75 %, yielding
a sample of 75 agencies. We anticipate an average of
18–24 eligible therapists per agency and a response rate
of 50 % at the therapist level, to yield a survey sample of
approximately 800 therapists.
Table 1 (see online resources) lists survey measures of
sustainment outcomes and agency- and therapist-level
predictors of sustainment to be included in therapist
and program manager surveys. All established measures
have strong evidence of reliability and validity. Two sur-
veys will be fielded over the course of the study in years
2 and 4 to provide repeated measures of the inner con-
text determinants of sustainment (organizational and
therapist characteristics). These data will permit examin-
ation of the stability of inner context factors and will
provide a more temporally proximal prediction of sus-
tainment outcomes during the final year of the study.
In-depth study
Multi-method data including surveys, qualitative inter-
views, and behavioral observations will be collected in a
subset of agencies. The objectives of the in-depth com-
ponent of the 4KEEPS study are twofold. First, it will
furnish qualitative interviews essential to our mixed
methods (QUAN + QUAL) design, with quantitative data
and qualitative data given equal weight. Combined ana-
lyses will be used for convergence (i.e., triangulation of
data across methods to determine if the same conclusionis reached) and complementarity (i.e., qualitative data
provide depth of understanding while quantitative data
provide breadth of understanding). Second, the in-depth
study will allow us to validate therapist self-reports of
EBP concordant care against behavioral observations.
The sampling frame for the in-depth study will be the
agencies enumerated into the survey sample described
above. We will target a sample of 120 therapists and at least
one program manager at each agency providing administra-
tive oversight for PEI practices . Therapist interview guides
will focus on training experie nces, attitudes toward prac-
tices, and adaptations made to practices. Program manager
interview guides will focus on barriers and facilitators of
implementation of practices, t he impact of adopting prac-
tices, and, when relevant, reasons for de-adoption of prac-
tices. Furthermore, therapists will provide self-reports of
practice implementation on the ECCA and supply audio re-
cordings of three therapy sessions for three clients.
In-depth study measure development activities
ECCA development Multiple inputs have informed the
development of a generic measure of EBP concordant
care in the treatment of six child MH problem areas:
anxiety, attachment problems, conduct, depression, sub-
stance abuse, and trauma addressed by the six practices
of interest. The ECCA will include a common set of
items regardless of what practice the therapist indicates
they are using, with separate summary scores for each
family of interventions. Item content was adapted from
existing practice inventories [48 –51], and additional
items were derived from intervention materials for prac-
tices not reflected in existing inventories. Practice ex-
perts, including intervention developers (i.e. authors of
treatment manuals), and master trainers were enlisted in
the item development process and in the determination
of EBP concordance for the treatment of child MH tar-
get areas. For validation, we will examine the corres-
pondence between therapist self-report on the ECCA
and observer ratings at the session level using a parallel
ECCA observational coding system.
Therapist adaptations of practices To develop a meas-
ure of therapist adaptations to practices, we will use
mixed methods sequentially (QUAN →qual→QUAN).
In the first therapist survey (year 2), we will collect quanti-
tative data to characterize the rapist adaptations on a large
scale using a questionnaire adapted from the Stirman et al.
[52, 53] framework of adaptations and modifications of
EBPs. Qualitative data from th erapist interviews will later
inform the refinement of the second therapist survey (year
4), using a Rapid Assessment Procedure (RAP) designed to
provide depth and specificity in quantitative measures for
assessing observed phenomena [54].Lau and Brookman-Frazee Implementation Science  (2016) 11:31 Page 5 of 8
Discussion
The 4KEEPS project will yield new understanding of
whether and how multiple EBPs can be sustained in
public MH systems undergoing policy-driven reform.
This project is significant for many reasons. First, con-
ducting an observational study of UC implementation of
this magnitude maximizes the representativeness ofagencies and therapists and the resultant generalizability
of findings. Most studies have focused on investigator-
driven implementation, whereas PEI was driven by
system-level stakeholders within a major policy reform.
Unlike experimental studies, observational studies of
system change are less likely to include only the ideal or-
ganizations with the greatest motivation and readinessTable 1 4KEEPS key constructs and measures as predictors of sustainment outcomes

to implement. There is greater independence from EBP
developers and their implementation “superstructures ”
when studying implementation as usual [55]. The outer
context policy change is likely to be a model for EBP
implementation in public MH systems. Yet we know
little about how such policies may unfold in the years
following adoption.
Second, examining the sustainment of multiple prac-
tices is essential because large-scale EBP reform is not
likely to involve dissemination of single interventions be-
cause any single EBP will not address all client MH
needs. Chorpita et al. [12] found that a minimum of
eight EBPs would be required to cover the range of
problems child MH problems represented in LACDMH.
The PEI transformation provides an opportunity to
study the determinants of sustainment across multiple
EBPs in a large, organizationally diverse, and ethnically
diverse service system. In this context, penetration of a
practice is relative to other available practices. This shifts
the focus away from questions about whether a given
intervention is likely to be sustained toward identifying
characteristics of practices and their fit with organiza-
tions that promote sustainment within a marketplace of
dissemination.
Third, methodological features of the study are im-
portant for the advancement of sustainment research.
Metrics of practice volume and penetration and EBP
concordant are necessary to assess the public health
impact promised by dissemination of EBPs. Using
generalizable methods, the study will produce feasible
metrics for assessing therapist adaptations and integrity
of EBP implementation across practices. Ultimately, the
findings will inform the development of implementation
interventions to promote sustained delivery of EBPs to
maximize their public health impact.
