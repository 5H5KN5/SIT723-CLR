Abstract
Background: Contact centres are one of the most sedentary workplaces, with employees spending a very high
proportion of their working day sitting down. About a quarter of contact centre staff regularly experience
musculoskeletal health problems due to high levels of sedentary behaviour, including lower back pain. There have
been no previous randomised studies specifically aiming to reduce sedentary behaviour in contact centre staff. To
address this gap, the Stand Up for Health (SUH) study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a complex
theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in contact centres.
Methods: The Stand Up for Health study has a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial design, which is a
pragmatic design whereby clusters (contact centres) are randomised to time points at which they will begin to
receive the intervention. All contact centre staff have the opportunity to experience the intervention. To minimise
the resource burden in this feasibility study, data collection is not continuous, but undertaken on a selective
number of occasions, so the stepped wedge design is “incomplete ”. Eleven contact centres in England and
Scotland have been recruited, and the sample size is approximately 27 per centre (270 in total). The statistical
analysis will predominantly focus on assessing feasibility, including the calculation of recruitment rates and rates of
attrition. Exploratory analysis will be performed to compare objectively measured sedentary time in the workplace
(measured using an activPAL ™device) between intervention and control conditions using a linear mixed effects
regression model.
Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first stepped wedge feasibility study conducted in call centres. The
rationale and justification of our novel staircase stepped wedge design has been presented, and we hope that by
presenting our study design and statistical analysis plan, it will contribute to the literature on stepped wedge trials,
and in particular feasibility stepped wedge trials. The findings of the study will also help inform whether this is a
suitable design for other settings where data collection is challenging.
Trial registration: The trial has been registered on the ISRCTN database: http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11580369

Background
Sedentary behaviour is known to contribute to poor
health outcomes such as poor mental health, musculo-
skeletal disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular disease
[1–6]. These risks are independent of physical activity
[7,8]. Conceptually, sedentary behaviour and physical
activity are different [ 9], with each thought to pose
health risks independent of each other [ 5,10–12]. Re-
cent studies have concluded that physical activity modi-
fies the association between sedentary behaviour and
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality
[13–15]. Additionally, in populations with lower physical
activity, sedentary behaviour is associated with greater
health risks [ 13–15]. As evidenced by a recent review
[16], interventions which showed the most promise in
reducing sitting time were those that aimed to directly
change sedentary behaviour rather than indirectly
through increasing physical activity. The reduction of
sedentary behaviour is therefore not a consequence of
effectively promoting physical activity and should be
recognised independently when developing interven-
tions, guidelines and legislation.
Many employees working in office-based environ-
ments become exposed to prolonged periods of inactiv-
ity in static seated postures, which are enforced by
factors such as ergonomic set-up and workplace culture
[17]. This sedentary behaviour can impact significantly
on the daily lives and activities of workers. For example,
musculoskeletal issues are one of the most prevalent oc-
cupational health problems for desk-based workers and
are a leading cause for disability worldwide [ 18–20].
Multi-component interventions have previously been
successful in reducing total [ 21] and prolonged [ 22] sed-
entary behaviour within this setting. However, few stud-
ies have been effective at promoting physical activity
[23] in the workplace and only a limited number of trials
have reported success in managing long-term positive
sedentary behaviour change [ 22]. In addition to other
study and population characteristics, the heterogeneity
of workplaces involved in some of these studies is likely
to have contributed to mixed findings.
Contact centres (also known as call centres) are associ-
ated with higher levels of sedentary behaviour than other
office-based workplaces [ 4,24,25]. Employees typically
spend up to 90% of their working day sitting down [ 24].
The technology used by staff in contact centres prevents
them from regularly leaving their desk and many call
handlers often report stressful work environments due
to low workplace autonomy, strict supervision of indi-
vidual performance and commission-based salary sys-
tems [ 26]. Contact centre staff may therefore be of
greater risk of developing non-communicable diseases
[24]. Additionally, one in four members of contact
centre staff regularly experience musculoskeletalproblems with 22.4% of sick days lost to such problems
[27]. At present, only a very limited number of research
studies have sought to explore the reduction of seden-
tary behaviour or promotion of physical activity in the
contact centre setting.
The combination of high levels of sedentary behaviour,
and the number of constraining factors, suggest that call
centres require tailored interventions. However, there
have been few attempts to do so [ 28–31]. Feasibility
work with centres in Liverpool, UK, identified a number
of challenges to reducing sedentary behaviour and in-
corporating physical activity into the shifts of call centre
workers [ 29]. These included having sufficient buy-in
from team leaders and wider stakeholders to support
intervention activities to reduce sedentary behaviour,
and high call centre staff attrition. This is why further
research into developing sustainable and scalable inter-
ventions in contact centres is vitally important; to ensure
healthier working policies are distributed equitably
across all workplaces, not just those that have more
worker autonomy and better workplace conditions.
To date, the evaluations of interventions to reduce
sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity con-
ducted in contact centres have all been non-randomised,
quasi-experimental studies and most were small pilot or
feasibility studies with short study durations. Only one
of the studies was conducted within the UK, but this
study was only conducted in a single contact centre with
very small sample size (13 individuals completing
follow-up), and with a short study duration of 8 weeks
[29]. Randomised designs are needed because they are
less susceptible to biases, but this has to be balanced by
what is pragmatic in this setting. Individually rando-
mised designs (i.e., randomisation occurs within one
contact centre/workplace) are unlikely to be viable be-
cause of the likelihood for contamination between inter-
vention and control participants. In contrast, cluster
randomised designs are more feasible because interven-
tions are applied at the centre level.
A type of cluster randomised design called a stepped
wedge trial involves randomising clusters to time points
at which they will start to receive the intervention [ 32].
This design is particularly appealing for public health in-
terventions since it has a number of features that make
it more practical to deploy, such as the staggered imple-
mentation of the intervention and giving every site the
opportunity to experience the intervention. This design
has been used in practice since as far back as 1987, but
was rarely seen in the literature until around 2007 [ 33].
Since then its popularity has increased greatly, especially
since 2010 [ 32]. Although stepped wedge designs are
now commonly seen in the literature, feasibility studies
with a stepped wedge design are not. In a recent system-
atic review of feasibility studies conducted in preparationParker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:139 Page 2 of 12
for future stepped wedge trials by Kristunas and col-
leagues, only three studies were identified that were
themselves stepped wedge trials [ 34]. However, since
that study has been published a non-systematic review
of the literature by ourselves has identified at least seven
new studies that have a stepped wedge feasibility study
design [ 35–41] (albeit three of the studies appear to have
come from the same research group). It therefore ap-
pears that this feasibility design has undergone a surge
in popularity since 2018. However, our study includes
some specific features of interest such as the way in
which we collect data. The stepped wedge design of this
feasibility study is recommended when preparing for a
larger future stepped wedge trial [ 34,42].
Stand Up for Health (SUH) is a multi-centre, feasibility
study incorporating a stepped wedge trial design. It aims
to test the feasibility and acceptability of a complex
theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour
in contact centres. The main aim of this paper is to
present the rationale for the stepped wedge study design
used in Stand Up for Health. This is important, not only
because of the limited number of such study designs in
the literature, but also because our design does not have
the typical layout and measurement frequency seen in
most other types of stepped wedge design, which re-
quires justification. We also present our statistical and
health economic analysis plan for analysing the data
from the trial and assessing the feasibility of future trials.
Methods
Study aims
The primary aim of the study is to test the acceptability
and feasibility of implementing the Stand Up for Health
intervention in contact centres and assess the feasibility
of using the stepped wedge cluster randomised con-
trolled trial study design. As a secondary aim of the
study, we also intend to scope the feasibility of a future
health economic evaluation of Stand Up for Health.
Intervention
Stand Up for Health (SUH) is an adaptive theory-based
complex intervention to reduce sedentary time built
around four theories of change: organisational, environ-
mental, social/cultural, and individual. The focus is on
fidelity to the theories of change rather than the specific
activities (so an environmental change in one centre
may be the use of standing desks, whilst in another it
may be change in usage of space). The intervention will
be delivered at the contact centre level with data col-
lected at both the contact centre and individual levels.
Individuals will be employees of the contact centres in-
cluding managers, supervisors and call operators in
Scotland and England (primarily the North of England).
It is not the purpose of this paper to report on theintervention design or content in detail. Further details
can be found on request to the corresponding author or

9/19.
Comparator
For sites in which the intervention has not been intro-
duced at the first time point (July 2019), they will start
in the control condition before eventually receiving the
intervention up to 12 months later. Whilst sites are
under the control condition, no component of the Stand
Up for Health intervention will be given.
Reporting
The trial will be reported in a manner consistent with
the stepped wedge extension [ 43] and the pilot study ex-
tension [ 44] to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials (CONSORT) reporting guidelines.
Study design
Stepped wedge trials are a type of cluster-randomised
trial in which clusters are randomised to sequences ra-
ther than groups; and these sequences determine the
specific time point at which clusters are supposed to
cross over from the control to the intervention condition
[43,45,46]. In standard cluster randomised trials, clus-
ters in the control group are time-matched to interven-
tion clusters and so no adjustment for natural (non-
intervention related) changes over time is necessary.
However, in stepped wedge cluster trials, time is a con-
founder by design, and therefore this factor needs to be
taken into account in the analysis.
In the case of Stand Up for Health, the clusters are in-
dividual contact centres that are randomised to specific
sequences or “rows ”in the stepped wedge design (see
Fig. 1). We randomised 11 contact centres to one of 5
unique sequences in Fig. 1, with each sequence corre-
sponding to specific intervention start dates and data
collection time points. There are three key 3-monthly
periods (control, intervention and post-intervention),
with data collection at the end of the control period,
post-intervention period, and also 3 months after the
end of the post-intervention period. There is a 3-
monthly duration between each step in the stepped
wedge diagram (Fig. 1).
However, unlike typical stepped wedge trial designs
[46], the Stand Up for Health trial does not measure
outcomes or recruit participants in every cluster-period
(i.e. not in every possible time period defined by cluster
or time), since this was deemed to create an unnecessar-
ily high resource burden in this feasibility study. Accord-
ingly, the trial could be described as an “incomplete
cross-forward cluster randomised design ”[47] because
although all sites cross over from the control to theParker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:139 Page 3 of 12
intervention condition, the stepped wedge design is “in-
complete ”because measurements are taken in only a
proportion of all possible cluster-periods. Another name
for this design is a “staircase ”design, which has already
been suggested as a potential highly efficient trial design
by Kasza and Forbes, and broadly similar designs have
already been adopted in practice [ 48–51]. The rationale
for this specific stepped wedge design is that data collec-
tion is concentrated in those cluster periods that provide
the most information about the treatment effect (i.e.
close to the time the sites begin to receive the interven-
tion) [ 48,49].
It is also important to note that the study has an “open
cohort ”design as described by Copas et al. such that
participants are repeatedly assessed over a series of
measurement points and participants can join and leave
the study throughout its duration [ 52]. Thus, we are
expecting some differences in the group of participants
assessed at the different data collection time points, al-
though we expect that participants will remain mostly
the same.
Rationale
Individual-level randomisation was not possible as the
SUH intervention was designed to be implemented at
the level of the workplace/contact centres; hence, ran-
domisation could only occur at the cluster level.
A stepped wedge trial design was chosen rather than
standard parallel group cluster randomised design for
several reasons:
Firstly, resource and cost limitations encountered dur-
ing projects of this nature often make it infeasible to roll
out the intervention and collect data simultaneously
from all clusters at the same time as in a traditional
parallel-group cluster design. The stepped wedge design
offers an advantage to this by staggering theimplementation of the intervention. This was of specific
importance in the SUH project where it was proposed
that 10 contact centres from a wide geographical spread
(across Scotland and England) were recruited.
Secondly, stepped wedge trials are particularly suited
for interventions that are unlikely to lead to harm, since
in a stepped wedge design everyone receives the inter-
vention [ 53]. In keeping with other interventions de-
signed to increase sedentary behaviour, the Stand Up for
Health intervention is unlikely to lead to harm. Indeed,
it may even bring positive benefits to those individuals
partaking in the intervention. The intervention has
already been implemented in one contact centre for over
a year and only positive benefits have been reported.
Thirdly, the intervention is such that it may be difficult
to“unlearn ”or completely abandon the principles learnt.
Study designs with crossover from the intervention back
to control are therefore not appropriate. In contrast,
stepped wedge designs are ideal for these types of inter-
ventions [ 54].
Fourth, our experience is that contact centres are
already wanting to implement the intervention when
they hear about it, so it was important that all contact
centres had an opportunity to ‘experience ’the interven-
tion. Randomising contact centres to a control group
without the opportunity to experience the intervention
might have affected recruitment and contact centre
engagement.
Fifth, despite the fact that contact centres share many
common characteristics, there is also variability in terms
of contact centre missions (e.g. sales, or services such as
police and NHS); sector (private or public); size (from
20-2000); shift patterns; and demographics of the call
centre staff. This between-site variability could result in
differences in terms of uptake of the intervention, as well
as in the outcome such as sedentary behaviour. We

placed no exclusion criteria regarding the types of con-
tact centres recruited. The majority of the centres are lo-
cated in the Northeast of England, with one in London
and two in Southern Scotland. Five are public sector, in-
cluding emergency services and a community council.
The remaining centres include banks, an insurance com-
pany and a telecommunications company. Shift patterns
vary; some centres employ staff to work 12 h shifts,
whereas others have more traditional 8 h work days, with
part time hours available. Staff numbers range from 33
to 2000, and consist of a range of age groups, and vary-
ing gender ratios. Some have a budget for well-being ac-
tivities, and provide individual benefits, whilst others do
not. Some centres already had staff well-being initiatives
in place prior to SUH. This range of factors leads to sig-
nificant variations in workplace culture between the
study sites. This means that we expect to achieve greater
statistical power in a stepped wedge design compared to
standard designs, since stepped wedge designs make
greater utilisation of within-site comparisons and mul-
tiple measurements within sites [ 46]. We do note how-
ever the “incomplete ”nature of measurements in this
feasibility study, so that although we do not expect much
gain in statistical power in the current study, we would
for a future stepped wedge trial that has more complete
measurements.
In summary, by having a stepped wedge design, this
enables us to achieve a pragmatic design that properly
takes into account the study context and what is accept-
able from the perspective of all stakeholders, including
contact centres and employees.
The above reasons for the design are similar to those
given in favour of the stepped wedge design for the
PRIME study [ 53]. Such designs are increasingly popular,
[32] and the results from such studies have been pub-
lished in high impact journals (e.g. Shah et al. [ 55] and
Norman et al. [ 54]).
Since this is a feasibility study, the main aim of the
trial is to assess feasibility outcomes rather than conduct
confirmatory statistical analysis. We are primarily inter-
ested in the feasibility of randomising sites to sequences,
implementation of the intervention condition and col-
lecting data across sites in different cluster-periods. This
is our main justification for an “incomplete measure-
ment ”approach, which would reduce the resource cost
and burden in the trial, and yet useful feasibility data
can still be collected.
Secondarily, the “open cohort ”design means that the
workforce under evaluation is expected to remain mostly
the same across the study duration and so the cost of
leaving out the measurement of some cluster-periods is
not expected to be as high as in continuous recruitment
designs, whereby there are different set of participants in
each cluster period. For example, in the HighSteacs trial(a continuous recruitment design) [ 55], if participants
were only recruited in some cluster-periods, then this
would reduce the sample size of participants dramatically,
whereas this would not happen in open cohort designs.
Sample size
In the SUH intervention, all employees at a site are likely
to be exposed to some or all of the intervention activ-
ities, or at least be aware of these. However, employees
will have the option of taking part in the research evalu-
ation component. Therefore, when we discuss the sam-
ple size, we are referring to the number of people taking
part in the evaluation (not those only taking part in
intervention activities). The sample size and target dif-
ference are the same as another similar study using a
standard parallel-group cluster randomised design that
proposed a sample size of 160 per arm to detect a reduc-
tion in workplace sedentary behaviour of 45 min per day
[56]. Considering the stepped wedge design for Stand
Up for Health, the focus is on the number of partici-
pants per cluster period rather than per trial arm, and
Fig. 1shows that we have at least 6 vertical cross sec-
tional comparisons between control and post-
intervention. Therefore in order to get 160 participants
included in the vertical comparisons, we need at least
160/6 = ~ 27 individuals per contact centre per data col-
lection period. We initially planned to recruit 10 contact
centres although 11 contact centres expressed interest
and met the criteria for inclusion. This number of sites
was considered large enough to ensure a diverse range
of contact centres and enable us to gather preliminary
estimates of the between-site variability. A total sample
size of 297 participants is therefore expected. One of the
aims of this feasibility study is to test sample size as-
sumptions and produce a more accurate sample size cal-
culation for a future study.
Inclusion criteria
All staff of working age (16 years or older) in the partici-
pating contact centres had (or will have) the opportunity
to take part; however, some additional criteria were ne-
cessary to ensure appropriate collection of data as per
the study design:
1. Provisionally scheduled to work during the 7 days of
data collection of the primary behavioural outcome
measure (activPAL activity monitor), aside from sched-
uled non-work days.
2. Not planning to leave the company in the 3 months
after recruitment.
Randomisation
DS and JM compiled a complete list of the contact cen-
tres who agreed to take part in the study; the list was
numbered 1 to 11, and then was signed and dated.Parker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:139 Page 5 of 12
Randomisation of contact centres to sequences was con-
ducted in May 2019, using computer-generated block
randomisation of time points (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5) to
sites, stratified by centre size ( ≤500 employees versus >
500 employees). Stratification by centre size ensured that
we did not by chance have a large imbalance in the com-
bined centre size across time points. Randomisation was
conducted by RP, who was fully blinded to the names of
the contact centres, and who generated a list of centre
numbers showing the sequences that each centre should
be allocated to (first column in Fig. 1).
Recruitment
Recruitment will be conducted by DS and JM mainly at
the control condition data collection time point in Fig.
1, but recruitment will also be allowed at follow-up time
points in Fig. 1. Informed consent will be taken prior to
data collection, after participants have read through the
information sheet and had the opportunity to ask ques-
tions of the researchers.
The intervention will be delivered at the centre level,
so all employees will have the opportunity to experience
the intervention. However, employees have the choice as
to whether they will take part in the evaluation. It is
therefore plausible that those employees who are the
most enthusiastic about the intervention, and potentially
motivated to change their behaviour will be recruited
and so those taking part may not be entirely representa-
tive of all employees at the call centre. However, we
would expect that those recruited are also those who en-
gage most strongly with the intervention, so that if there
really is a benefit from using the intervention then we
will be more likely to identify it in this study.
Methods to minimise bias
Randomisation of the centres to time points will (in the-
ory) allow us to introduce the intervention to each site
in an unbiased way unrelated to time factors or the par-
ticular circumstances of each site. It also helps to ensure
there is an approximate balance on average across all
the intervention start times in terms of participant or
contact centre characteristics. Dates when the sites actu-
ally started the intervention will be recorded (if different
from the planned start times).
Randomisation was conducted independently of the
team recruiting centres and so this rules out selection
bias at the centre level. Nevertheless, due to the nature
of the intervention, participants and the personnel
recruiting participants cannot be blinded. Therefore, se-
lection bias at the participant level is a possibility
whereby knowledge of the allocation condition will de-
termine who is recruited. However, this possibility is
mitigated for two key reasons. Firstly, the randomisation
list will be kept hidden from all contact centres andstudy investigators except DS and JM who will contact
sites to arrange a suitable time to introduce the interven-
tion. Where possible, allocation concealment will be
used whereby centres will only be informed about
exactly when they will start the intervention when they
have to know in order to arrange time to organise the
intervention visit. Secondly, the open cohort design
means that we would expect a significant overlap in the
participants recording data under the control and inter-
vention conditions. We will make every effort to follow-
up participants recruited under the control condition
and collect their follow-up data to minimise the possibil-
ity of differential selection bias between intervention and
control conditions and/or attrition bias. Moreover, a
sensitivity analysis on the primary outcome will involve
including only those participants recording data at mul-
tiple time points within each cluster.
Respondent bias is also a possibility due to the lack of
blinding, whereby participants may be more likely to
change their responses to the questionnaires according
to whether their centre is under the intervention or con-
trol conditions, and these responses may be discon-
nected from reality. However, we will also include
objective measurements based on the activPAL device
that is anticipated to be less affected by biases.
It is possible that staff may move between contact cen-
tres allocated to different trial arms, introducing the po-
tential for contamination, however, we expect that this
number will be very small (if any) and will have little im-
pact. In any case, we have included a question in the
baseline questionnaire asking if participants have previ-
ously worked for a company using the Stand Up for
Health intervention. We will also attempt to ask partici-
pants when they leave a centre if they intend to work at
another centre included in the study.
A statistician who is blinded to the names of contact
centres and participants will perform the statistical
analysis.
Study outcomes
Study outcomes will be measured at all of the data col-
lection time points ( “D”) indicated in Fig. 1. As this is a
feasibility study, we will be testing out the methods of
collecting data on outcomes, as well as preliminary esti-
mates of effectiveness. The primary outcome is object-
ively measured sedentary time in the workplace,
measured over seven continuous days, using an activ-
PAL ™device.
Secondary outcomes include the following:
1. Subjectively measured sedentary time in the
workplace, as measured by The Occupational
Sitting and Physical Activity Questionnaire
(OSPAQ) [ 57]Parker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:139 Page 6 of 12
2. Objectively measured (activPAL ™device) prolonged
sitting time in the workplace (bouts of ≥30 min)
3. Objectively measured (activPAL ™device) total
sedentary time (i.e. including time outside the
workplace such as at home and leisure time)
4. Objectively measured (activPAL ™device) workplace
and total standing time
5. Objectively measured (activPAL ™device) workplace
and total physical activity (based on stepping)
6. Objectively measured (activPAL ™device) workplace
and total sit-to-stand transitions
7. Objective measures of productivity, which may
include absenteeism, presenteeism, call handling
time, time spent talking, time spent on hold, time
spent wrapping up a call, attendance, or sick leave
8. Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) [ 58]
9. Mental well-being as measured by the Warwick-
Edinburgh Mental Well-being scale (WEMWBS)
[59]
10. Musculoskeletal health as measured by the
MSK-HQ [ 60]
11. Scottish Physical Activity Screening Question
(Scot-PASQ) [ 61]
12. Activities questionnaires to measure the use of
activities and preference
13. Staff turnover: number of people leaving and
number of new joiners over the study period
Progression criteria
In this feasibility study, we have set pre-specified pro-
gression criteria to determine whether we can proceed
to a larger future study. We will apply for further fund-
ing if all of the following criteria are satisfied:
1. A 95% confidence interval for the primary outcome
includes a clinically relevant reduction in sedentary
time of 45 min per day or greater in favour of the
intervention. This would reflect substantial
progression toward accumulating recommended
quantity of 2 h/day standing/light activity during
working hours for employees in predominantly
desk-based occupations. Given that the sample size
calculation is based on a previous study [ 56] speci-
fying 90% power to detect a 45-min difference, pre-
sumably at the 5% significance level, then we would
expect that if the observed difference is zero or in
favour of control then our 95% confidence interval
will not include the 45-min difference. This is espe-
cially true given our final sample size is expected to
be much greater than the 160 sample size target of
the previous study (in the region of 297).
2. The intervention was successfully delivered in at
least five of the sites within the study period, and ifat least one person in each site was able to use/
experience at least one activity.
3. Primary and secondary outcome data was collected
in at least 75% of participants overall.
4. Contamination between sites is low or else it is
envisaged that contamination can be addressed in
the study design of a future study.
5. It is envisaged that any practical difficulties in
delivering the intervention across multiple sites or
in measuring effectiveness can be overcome when
conducting a future large-scale study.
Statistical analysis plan
Assessment of recruitment rate and loss to follow-up
Our focus in the statistical analysis will be mainly on
assessing feasibility, including examination of the re-
cruitment rate and loss to follow-up in the study. Infor-
mation on the timing and reason for any participant
withdrawals or loss to follow-up will be collected where
possible. We will calculate the following proportions:
(i) The proportion of participants who consent to take
part in the evaluation out of the total number of
employees (overall and in each centre), with 95%
confidence intervals.
(ii) The proportion of participants who drop-out or
who are lost-to-follow-up out of the total number
of employees (overall and in each centre), with 95%
confidence intervals.
(iii)Related to the above, we will record the proportion
of participants who leave the company in between
consent and 6/9 months follow-up (overall and in
each centre), with 95% confidence intervals.
(iv) The proportion of participants who state that they
have previously worked for a company which has
used the Stand Up for Health intervention.
Baseline data analysis
Centre-level descriptive information will be given for the
contact centres, including centre size, location, shift pat-
terns, gender split, and age range of workforce.
Participant-level descriptive statistics will be computed
based on data collected at baseline: including age, gen-
der, employment type, and length of time working in the
centre. Categorical baseline data will be presented using
counts and percentages, whilst continuous variables will
be presented using the mean, median, standard deviation
(SD), minimum, maximum, first quartile, third quartile,
and number of participants with a response ( n). Baseline
data will be presented overall and stratified by (i) site,
and (ii) by allocated sequence group (i.e. T1, T2, T3, T4,
T5).Parker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:139 Page 7 of 12
Descriptive analysis of outcome data
All study outcomes will be summarised descriptively,
split by intervention condition. Additionally, we will
summarise the primary outcome split by both site and
by intervention condition. Outcome data will be pre-
sented in a similar format to the baseline data: counts
and percentages for categorical variables, whilst continu-
ous variables will be presented using the mean, median,
standard deviation (SD), minimum, maximum, first
quartile, third quartile, and number of participants with
a response ( n). We will also summarise the number and
proportion of missing data for each outcome.
Assessing the feasibility of the planned statistical models
for the main trial
In a future larger multi-site study, it is our intention to
fit the following statistical model:
A linear mixed effects regression model will be fitted
to our primary outcome of objectively measured seden-
tary time in the workplace, with participants nested
within site (both random effects), adjusting for calendar
time since the start of study (as a categorical variable in
months), and including two dummy variables for
whether the intervention has been implemented for 6 or
9 months respectively (i.e. whether data was collected in
the first or second follow-up time points).
Other continuous secondary outcomes (including sub-
jectively measured sedentary time in the workplace, pro-
longed sitting in the workplace, total sedentary time,
workplace standing time, total standing time, workplace
and total sit-to-stand transitions, objectively measured
workplace and total physical activity, subjective physical
activity, mental well-being, and musculoskeletal health),
will be analysed using the same linear mixed effects re-
gression analysis as above.
We will perform the same analysis in this feasibility
study for four reasons as follows:
(i) To assess the feasibility of applying this
methodology in practice, especially with respect to
assessing model fit/convergence and the magnitude
of the standard errors.
(ii) To calculate 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the
intervention effect sizes to provide a guide to
indicate the likely true effect sizes in the population,
and the likely effect sizes that will be observed in a
future study. For the primary outcome, this 95% CI
will be used to assess if the first progression
criterion is met: namely, that our 95% CI includes a
45 min per day reduction in sedentary time.
(iii)To provide preliminary estimates of the between-
contact centre variability and within-contact centre
variability based on variances produced in themodel output, as a means to assess the heterogen-
eity of quantitative outcomes across sites.
(iv) To explore the effects of missing data and staff
turnover using sensitivity analyses to aid the design
of a definitive trial. This will involve imputing
plausible, but extreme, values for any missing data
(e.g. highest recorded sedentary time), whilst also
using any information available on the reasons for
missing data (if available).
(v) To explore the effect of excluding participants only
recording data at a single time point, to assess if
this type of sensitivity analysis is possible in the
definitive trial, and whether it has an impact on the
results. If results change substantially then this may
be due to possible selection bias across time points.
The linear mixed effect model results in this feasibility
study will be interpreted as exploratory rather than con-
firmatory. This means that we will acknowledge the need
for future studies to confirm our findings.
Linear mixed effects models will be based on the ac-
tual times the sites started the intervention rather than
the “as-randomised ”times, mainly because this is a feasi-
bility study and we wish to reliably assess efficacy with
respect to the first progression criteria. However, for the
primary outcome analysis, we will also separately fit a
model based on the “as-randomised ”times to investigate
if this makes a difference.
Analysis of staff turnover
We will investigate if some types of participants are
more likely to leave the company due to staff turnover
than others, which will inform the design of the future
study. This will involve fitting a logistic mixed regression
model to a binary outcome variable indicating whether
or not employees who initially consent to the study
evaluation have left the company within 6 months (yes
or no), adjusting for site as a random effect, and includ-
ing the following covariates: age, gender, employment
type, and length of time working in the centre. If the
proportion leaving the company is very low and the
model does not converge, we will consider other analysis
methods (e.g. univariate analyses). We will repeat the
same analysis considering 9 months follow-up, and for
loss to follow-up in general.
General analysis principles
Analyses will include all sites who agreed to take part in
SUH regardless of the circumstances of implementation
of the intervention or subsequent site withdrawal. Any
sites for which the intervention was not implemented at
the correct time or failed to be fully implemented will
still be included provided that outcome data areParker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:139 Page 8 of 12
available on participants. Similarly, we will include all
eligible participants in the analysis.
There will be no interim analysis of the trial data and
the statistical analysis will be performed at the end of
the study.
Health economics
The health economic component aims to lay the
groundwork for any future definitive trial, from (a) an
NHS and PSS perspective (following the NICE reference
case [ 62] to maximise UK policy relevance), and (b) an
employer ’s perspective (which may be important at an
implementation stage to leverage commercial support).
With regards to the NHS and PSS perspective, whilst it
is possible that fitness level improvement may be observ-
able within a trial, it is not anticipated that such fitness
would be likely to translate into changes in “hard ”health
outcomes or patterns of healthcare utilisation (i.e. primary
or secondary care utilisation) within an observable trial
period. Hence, standard “within trial ”style analyses are
not anticipated to be appropriate. Instead, the health eco-
nomic component of the study will focus on scoping the
possibility for future economic modelling of longer-term
outcomes through consultations with managers and clini-
cians regarding possible model structures and associated
data sources, with targeted literature searches for potential
parameter sources such as cardiovascular risk equations.
These will be compiled into a short report documenting
possible modelling inputs or data gaps with a qualitative
assessment of how feasible such modelling would be and
the anticipated usefulness of any simulated outcomes to
an NHS and PSS decision-maker.
With regards to an employer ’s perspective, within-trial
observations will be limited to estimates of the cost of
direct implementation costs, such as workstation adjust-
ments, SUH equipment, information sessions or similar
presented alongside descriptive statistics regarding the
rates of installation of each, and measures of productiv-
ity and absenteeism. With regards to absenteeism and
productivity measures, consultations will be held with
management staff to ascertain what measures they
would find most useful and are potentially available to
collate. Whilst specific details are to be determined it is
anticipated that these will be in natural units such as
total attendance/sick leave, call handling time, time
spent on hold, time spent wrapping up a call, or similar
metrics used internally by the centres to measure per-
formance. It is also anticipated that many of these may
be available in aggregate level only. Outcomes of interest
will be documented; availability of data and suitability of
data for use in a future trial will be reported. Where data
is available, descriptive metrics and rates of missingness
will be reported as deemed appropriate with discussionaround their likely benefit and practicality for use in fu-
ture trials.
Discussion
Stepped wedge studies are a pragmatic and cost-effective
way of undertaking feasibility studies for public health
interventions. They enable both the intervention and the
study procedures (e.g. recruitment and data collection)
to be modified and developed over time in a way that
parallel-group designs do not facilitate. This results in
greater learning about what is feasible and gathering of
information on contextual factors including the size of
individual centres, their function and purpose; their en-
vironmental and their cultural constraints. Information
gathered from this feasibility study will help determine
the feasibility of conducting a future multi-site study
using a stepped wedge design with a larger number of
contact centres and inform the power calculation for a
future trial. It will enable both the intervention and the
study procedures to be adaptive and responsive to the
complex system in which they are being delivered and
implemented. Without taking such an approach, both
the effectiveness of the intervention and any evaluation
design are likely to be sub-optimal.
Nevertheless, there are some particular challenges as-
sociated with stepped wedge designs [ 63]. Of particular
relevance to our study are the challenges with maintain-
ing centre-level and participant-level engagement, chal-
lenges with ensuring the intervention start times follow
the pre-planned schedule [ 63], increased risk of drop-
out or contamination due to the longer study duration,
and the possibility of residual confounding due to
natural secular changes over time.
A large part of the intervention depends on the level
of support, enthusiasm, co-operation and co-ordination
of the participating contact centres, and the key staff
with whom the researchers liaise with. This heavily im-
pacts on the context and manner with which the inter-
vention is delivered, and how it is received by staff and
management. More importantly, the amount of effort
put forth by the centre to recruit, what tactics are used
and how it is framed to staff, impacts on participant
numbers. The researchers can only control and guide so
much of this through correspondence. One study
assigned a dedicated staff member, who worked for and
was paid by the organisation as the research liaison,
assisting with recruitment and intervention logistics [ 56].
This may have been helpful in the current study by im-
proving engagement and organisational buy-in within
the centres. This study will be supplemented by a quali-
tative component to explore these aspects, and the
acceptability of data collection methods in greater detail.
To our knowledge, this is the first stepped wedge feasi-
bility study conducted in call centres. The rationale andParker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:139 Page 9 of 12
justification of our novel staircase stepped wedge design
has been presented, and we hope that by presenting our
study design and statistical analysis plan it will contrib-
ute to the literature on stepped wedge trials, and in par-
ticular feasibility stepped wedge trials. The findings of
the study will also help inform whether this is a suitable
design for other settings where data collection is
challenging.
