Progress in conducting and reporting behaviour change
intervention studies: a prospective retrospection

ABSTRACT
Background: ehaviour change is a key to addressing many health
and healthcare problems and interventions have been designed to
improve health outcomes. These behaviour change interventions
have been evaluated in many ways, including randomisedcontrolled trials, and over recent decades there has been
considerable progress in the conduct and reporting these studies.
This paper is a personal retrospection on the changes occurringthat have resulted in our current improved methods and their
potential for future advancement.
Advances: There has been steady development of methods for
conducting trials, including advances in statistical methods
enabled by increase computing power and programmes, greaterattention to the recruitment of participants and in the
speci ﬁcation of outcomes. Trial reporting has improved, largely
due to publication of guidelines for reporting interventions and
trials, but until recently the reporting of behaviour change
interventions has been quite limited. Developments in thespeci ﬁcation of active ingredients of these interventions, the
behaviour change techniques, has transformed our ability to
report interventions in a manner that facilitates evidence synthesis
and enables replication and implementation. However, further
work using ontological approaches is needed to adequatelyrepresent the evidence contained in the mass of accumulated
studies. Meanwhile, attention is gradually being paid to the
comparator groups in trials leading to better reporting but with
continuing challenges about how control groups are selected.
Conclusions: These developments are important for the
advancements of behavioural science –but also in consolidating
the expertise needed to address global social, environmental and
health challenges.ARTICLE HISTORY

may be the target for healthcare interventions. Behaviour change interventions (BCIs)
have been implemented by diverse agencies and practitioners, such as educators, legis-
lators, advertisers as well as behavioural scientists. There is no agreed standard of howwe report BCIs and their evaluation, but guidelines have resulted in considerableimprovement over recent decades. Here I present a personal account of what has been
learned and what it would have been good to know years ago to improve the scienti ﬁc
and practical value of BCI research conducted.
Historically, the style and quality of BCI reporting adopted to ensure that BCIs are
replicated faithfully has di ﬀered for di ﬀerent types of BCI. Laboratory studies have
adopted the standards of science, i.e. enough detail of what was actually done, andwhat was delivered, for other scientists to replicate the methods. By contrast, ﬁeld
studies in which BCIs are delivered as clinical or healthcare interventions may give
quite limited descriptions of the intervention and therefore present challenges forthose wishing to replicate, or for systematic reviewers trying to decipher what BCI
content was actually delivered. Three papers we published in the 1970s illustrate this
problem. The laboratory study (Johnston, 1976 ) describes a series of experiments com-
paring the learning of delinquents and non-delinquents under conditions of social orﬁnancial reward in tasks involving either tracking of light or construction of sentences.
The report details participant selection, recruitment and instructions for the task; precise
information about the context, equipment and spatial layout of the room are providedand every word of the BCI active content is reported. The clinical study (Johnston,
1977 ) describes the behavioural treatment for agoraphobia, for a series of patients seen
in a primary care setting. The paper refers to a manual for detail of the BCI. Unlikethe laboratory study, further safeguarding of reliable implementation of the BCIs clini-
cally was provided by extensive supervision arrangements. The healthcare intervention
(Johnston & Lee-Jones, 1979 ) describes a randomised controlled trial of the management
of post-surgical patients in either a district general or community hospital, investigatingreturn to usual activities of daily living, but little information is given about the interven-
tion other than referring to a policy paper describing the development of community
hospitals. The community hospital intervention aimed to achieve earlier dischargefrom the district general hospital in order to reduce costs, limit exposure to nosocomial
infection and speed return to usual environment and activities. The community hospital
was implemented in two settings, each being compared with the same district generalhospital; the results showed that one community hospital had superior results, the
other inferior results to the district general hospital, re ﬂecting di ﬀerences in the
implementation of what was purported to be the same BCI. Clearly, the reporting ofthe healthcare BCI leaves considerable scope for improvement over subsequent years.
Good quality reporting is important for several reasons. First, if a successful BCI is
poorly reported it will be di ﬃcult to implement it reliably in practice, resulting in
poor outcomes for individuals who might have bene ﬁted from the successful BCI.
Second, practitioners may wrongly believe they are implementing the successful BCI
when they are omitting essential ingredients. Third, unsuccessful or even harmful inter-
ventions may be repeated, resulting in both potential harm and waste of resources.Fourth, if BCIs are poorly reported, evidence syntheses may not be able to incorporate
evidence from the poorly reported studies, or it may involve writing to authors for infor-
mation about the BCI content, a procedure that only succeeds if the details have been568 M. JOHNSTON
stored. Fifth, the science of behaviour change will advance more slowly if the best evi-
dence is unusable as BCIs are not adequately reported: every science depends on good
reporting of methods, analyses and results in order to progress.
The quality of reporting of BCI studies must be evaluated against two separate sets of
criteria: the criteria for conducting and reporting the methods of testing the success of the
BCI and the standards for reporting the intervention itself. Since the 1970s progress has
been made, some due to advances in computing technology, but much of which couldtechnically have been included in the 1970s if the guidance had been available.
Conducting and reporting BCI trials
While randomised controlled trials (RCTs) had been used in other disciplines and in eval-
uating the e ﬀectiveness of drugs, it was only in the 1970s that they were applied in studies of
healthcare interventions. Early studies, such as Johnston and Lee-Jones ( 1979 ), reported
methods of randomisation of participants to conditions but were frequently weak ondetail concerning other potential sources of bias. The 1996 publication of CONSORT
guidelines http://www.consort-statement.org/ proposed the necessary information to be
reported for a healthcare intervention and updating of these guidelines, with extensionssuch as ‘social and psychological interventions ’http://www.consort-statement.org/
extensions/overview/social-and-psychological-interventions , have substantially
improved reporting. The initial guideline was for parallel-group studies but later additionshave bene ﬁted from developments in statistical and computing methods and provide
guidelines for reporting other trial designs including cluster randomised and N-of-1
trial designs (Vieira, McDonald, Araújo-Soares, Sniehotta, & Henderson, 2017 ). In
addition, there have been in ﬂuential documents on the methods of development of
complex interventions. The UK Medical Research Council ’sﬁrst guidance document rec-
ommended a linear sequence in the development, paralleling the methods used in drug
trials (Campbell et al., 2000 ). The next version emphasised a more iterative process and
a greater variety of research designs (Craig et al., 2008 ). The most recent version will
put more emphasis on the developments of complex interventions within their context
and with more stress on a systems approach (Simpson & Moore, 2021 ). This would
surely have made more sense of the results of the community hospital studies of Johnston& Lee-Jones as the results were probably mainly in ﬂuenced by the historical context of the
local hospitals and their status in their respective communities.
Meanwhile methods of synthesising evidence from RCTS was developing. Methods of
conducting and reporting systematic reviews were advanced by the creation of the
Cochrane Collaboration (Chalmers, Dickersin, & Chalmers, 1992 ;https://www.
cochrane.org/ ) and the evaluation of bias in the RCTs included using the ‘risk-of-bias ’
tool https://www.riskofbias.info/ . Prior to the mid-1990s, reviewers had to ﬁnd papers
by hand-searching and correspondence with authors (e.g. Johnston & Vögele, 1993 );
the later Powell et al. ( 2016 ) updating of Johnston & Vogele ’s study illustrates
methods and reporting of systematic reviews following the development of Cochrane
and PRISMA (Page et al., 2021 ) guidance. While some progress has depended on
digital technologies, especially in ﬁnding relevant studies (e.g. Shemilt et al., 2014 )
many of these advances could have been implemented with the resources available atany time.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOURAL MEDICINE 569
Technology has particularly advanced statistical methods that require vast amounts of
computing power, such as multi-level modelling, time series and latent growth modelling
but other progress in research designs and trial analysis could have been made without it.The ‘intention-to-treat ’principle was gradually introduced to overcome bias in the
design, analysis and interpretation of trial results but even as late as the 1990s this prin-
ciple was being applied and reported incorrectly (Hollis & Campbell, 1999 ), especially in
dealing with participants allocated to an active treatment who, for various reasons, fail toreceive the treatment. More recently other methods of conducting analyses have been
used to allow interpretation and appropriate reporting of results when some participants
allocated to a treatment do not receive it, including per-protocol participant allocation tointervention arms in pragmatic trials and methods of allowing for participant ‘compli-
ance ’with the intervention protocol (Peugh, Strotman, McGrady, Rausch, & Kashikar-
Zuck, 2017 ). Zelen methods were designed to incorporate consent procedures into the
design and therefore more precise reporting of randomisation procedures (Bradley,
1993 ).
Despite factorial designs being frequently used in laboratory experiments they are not
used frequently in trials of health care interventions. This is surprising given the gain inpower for testing more than one intervention simultaneously and the obvious impor-
tance of evaluating the joint e ﬀect of two interventions. For example, in a test of an edu-
cational intervention and a reward-based intervention using a factorial design to testsingle and combined e ﬀects, we found the rewards were e ﬀective, but the educational
intervention was not, and the educational intervention did not increase the improvement
in dentists ’clinical management of children ’s teeth (Clarkson et al., 2008 ). Some combi-
nations of interventions may be either impossible or improbable and Collins, Murphy,
and Strecher ( 2007 ) have proposed that fractional factorial designs could be used to
test the most probable combinations of intervention components as part of the MOSTmethods.
More explicit reporting of the rationale for numbers of participants and methods of
recruitment have also been developed resulting in trials that have the power to
examine the research question. Prior to standardised methods of conducting power cal-culations, authors typically provided no explanation of the number of participants
included and may have been conducting underpowered trials. For example, I was
involved in an early trial of therapeutic communities to reduce delinquent recidivismconducted before the days of power-analyses. My main contribution was to calculate
that, given the maximum possible rate of throughput, it would be impossible to
achieve a signi ﬁcant e ﬀect in less than 10 years; as a result the trial was stopped and
not reported. At a later date, this calculation would have been done in advance avoiding
much inconvenience, waste of resources and, potentially, reporting of an under-powered
trial. Methods of conducting power calculations are now available for many di ﬀerent
research designs (Perugini, Gallucci, & Costantini, 2018 ). In addition, more care is
being paid to the recruitment of participants that represent the target population
without the selection bias that may result from convenience samples and greater atten-
tion is paid to factors that may bias recruitment and retention in trials (Bricca et al.,2021 ).
The reason for selecting and scheduling outcome variables has also improved. In early
healthcare evaluation studies, outcomes were rarely based on a model of the processes570 M. JOHNSTON
involved and measures were a mixture of clinical, behavioural and social outcomes
(McDowell, 2006 ). Outcomes of BCI trials may be speci ﬁed as behaviour or, based on
the model, the resulting health outcome. The WHO ICF model identi ﬁes potential out-
comes as impairment, disability (limitations) or participation (restrictions) and di ﬀerent
BCIs may impact di ﬀerent outcomes (WHO). For example, a surgical intervention might
address impairment, a physiotherapy intervention activity limitations and a social or
psychological intervention might increase social participation. However, outcomemeasures frequently represent a mixture of these three outcomes (Pollard, Johnston, &
Dieppe, 2006 ) and may be insensitive to the actual mode of action of the interventions.
Even when the target outcome is clear it is also important to specify when that outcomeshould be assessed, and recent trials have been more precise in specifying the pattern of
improvement and relapse over time. For BCIs targeting a habitual health-related behav-
iour, time is required for a change of habits to be observed, and for relapsing behaviourssuch as smoking cessation, at least a year is usually scheduled (Black, Johnston et al.,
2020 ; Black et al., 2020 ). Where the BCI targets a recovery process, then evidence
about usual recovery times is valuable in specifying the outcome measurement date;for example, recovery from stroke reaches a plateau at about 6 months and trials typicallymake assessments at that point (Johnston et al., 2007 ). Intensive longitudinal methods,
using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) also allow the assessment of progress
toward the target outcome. Berli, Inauen, Stadler, Scholz, and Shrout ( 2020 ) discuss
methods of distinguishing when an endpoint outcome may be the result of a steady,
improving or relapsing pattern.
Clearly, there is much in current knowledge and practice in the conduct and reporting
of BCI evaluations and more generally in trials and evidence synthesis that it would have
been advantageous to know about in earlier years. While some of these improvements
depend on technological developments, most of the things mentioned here could havebeen implemented 30 or 40 years ago but it has taken these years to clarify and standar-dise improved practices. Can the same be said about how we conduct and report the
interventions themselves?
Conducting and reporting behaviour change interventions
As the paper on community hospitals illustrates, early reporting of complex interventions
was very limited and not adequate for ensuring replication (Johnston & Lee-Jones); the
two implementations of the intervention resulted in opposite results clearly indicatingthat something di ﬀerent was happening in the two community hospitals. While reporting
of trial methodology improved in the late twentieth century, well-designed, expensive
trials were still being used to evaluate BCI interventions which were scantily describedand based on little more than the authors ’ideas of how behaviour might be changed
(Johnston, 1995 ). Even when we attempted to report BCIs well, it was not clear how it
should be done. In the mid-1990s, a journal editor encouraged our research team towrite more to describe the content of a cardiac rehabilitation BCI, but we had only
vague ideas of how to do this. As a result, despite this generous invitation, the resulting
description is very clear on when, where, how and by whom the intervention was deliv-ered, and indicated how it was tailored to individuals but the complete description of thecontent gave remarkably little guidance:HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOURAL MEDICINE 571
The counselor provided information, guided action plans, gave advice, and provided lea ﬂets
and videos that were already available, i.e. they were not produced for this program. Thepatients were encouraged to take control by contributing to their own assessment and
plans. For example, the choice of topic was guided by the patient ’s choice from the following
written menu. (Johnston, Foulkes, Johnston, Pollard, & Gudmundsdottir, 1999 )
Reference was made to a manual which, at that pre-digital time, would have been una-
vailable to researchers or practitioners reading the paper and so, the net result was avery successful intervention that could not be reliably replicated. Anecdotally, webelieve that some practitioners may have replicated the methods of delivery but may
not have managed to replicate the active content of the BCI.
Theﬁrst attempt to create standards of reporting led to the publication of the ﬁrst
CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement (Begg et al., 1996 )
but the only guidance on reporting the intervention was the item: ‘Planned interventions
and their timing ’. The updated guidance in 2001 improved many aspects of reporting,
but when it came to reporting the intervention it only speci ﬁed:‘Item 4. Precise
details of the interventions intended for each group and how and when they were actually
administered …Authors should describe each intervention thoroughly, including
control interventions ’(Moher et al., 2001). In 2020 , Davidson et al., discussed the
requirements of BCIs and recommended CONSORT guidelines for reporting with
some additional guidance on describing the intervention and at the same time supported
use of Cochrane standards for systematic reviews.
However, it became clear that more was needed and the TIDieR checklist (Template
for Intervention description and replication) (Ho ﬀmann et al., 2014 ) recognised the need
for reporting that enabled replication of the intervention, for any type of intervention;more recently variations have been developed for public health interventions (Campbell
et al., 2018 ; Cotterill, John, & Johnston, 2020 ). However, there is ample evidence that the
reporting of BCIs is inferior to the reporting of other interventions (Johnston, 2014 ).
Nonpharmacological interventions are more poorly reported than pharmacological
interventions (Ho ﬀmann, Erueti, & Glasziou, 2013 ) and, compared with other non-
pharmacological interventions, BCI reports give less information about the BCI in thetitles and abstracts of their papers (McCleary, Duncan, Stewart, & Francis, 2013 ).
While TIDieR clari ﬁes the essentials that should be reported, the template is generic
and applies equally well to the reporting of surgical, rehabilitation and psychological
interventions rather than being adapted for BCIs. Further details have been speci ﬁed
for social and psychological trials (Montgomery et al., 2018 ) in their extension to
CONSORT, they specify Item 5 as ‘The interventions for each group with su ﬃcient
details to allow replication, including how and when they were actually administered
’
and provide additional detail:
5a: Extent to which interventions were actually delivered by providers and taken up by par-
ticipants as planned; 5b: Where other informational materials about delivering the interven-tion can be accessed: 5c: When applicable, how intervention providers were assigned to eachgroup.
Even this update did not advance the description of active BCI content.
The most signi ﬁcant advance in reporting BCIs came with Abraham and Michie ’s
(2008 ) introduction of the term ‘behaviour change techniques ’(BCTs), now a term572 M. JOHNSTON
deﬁned in the Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine as in the text box. In an earlier paper
we had developed: ‘a taxonomy of behaviour change programmes …for classi ﬁcation of
underlying model, behaviour change methods, and modes of delivery ’(Hardeman,
Griﬃn, Johnston, Kinmonth, & Wareham, 2000 ) but this was extremely limited com-
pared with the subsequent work by Michie and colleagues leading to the development
of several domain speci ﬁc taxonomies and eventually to the generic Behaviour Change
Technique Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) of 93-item hierarchically organised BCTs (Michieet al., 2013 ),which brought together many of the taxonomies that had developed in the
interim, and evaluated the resulting taxonomy in a series of studies (Michie et al.,
2015 ). BCTTv1 has been used and cited over 2500 times, especially as a means of synthe-
sising evidence across BCI studies which used BCTTv1 to identify and therefore integrate
ﬁndings over a varied range of BCTs. It has also been used to develop a tool linking BCTs
to the theoretical mechanism of action based on triangulation of evidence from literaturesynthesis and expert consensus (Johnston et al., 2020 ).
“A behavior change technique (BCT) is a systematic procedure included as an active component of an intervention
designed to change behavior.
The de ﬁning characteristics of a BCT are that it is:
A component of an intervention designed to change a speci ﬁed behaviorThe smallest (or smallest for the particular purpose) component that can be postulated to be an active ingredient
within the interventionAn observable activityReplicableSpeci ﬁed by an active verb and clarity about the desired behavior change targeted with enough detail to achieve
good agreement between experts
A BCT is the smallest component of an intervention compatible with retaining the postulated active ingredients, and
can be used alone or in combination with other BCTs." [De ﬁnition of Behaviour Change Technique (Michie, Johnston,
& Carey, 2020 )].
At the same time Kok and colleagues had been developing a classi ﬁcation of behaviour
change methods, also linked to theory, within an Intervention Mapping approach to BCI
development and evaluation (Kok et al., 2016 ). From a dearth of methods for reporting
BCIs there is now a choice of systematic methods of describing interventions in a waythat enables better replication than was possible even in the previous 20 years.
Despite these improvements in reporting BCIs, there continues to be poor reporting of
the active content or the rationale for the control or comparator groups against which
BCIs are evaluated. When we presented the research on evaluating early post-surgical
discharge to community hospitals, Archie Cochrane (Winkelstein, 2009 ) was in the audi-
ence and he challenged me to explain why we had chosen to compare continuing districtgeneral hospital care with early discharge to community hospitals, suggesting that it
might have been more appropriate to compare it with early discharge to home. As in
so many things he anticipated subsequent developments, and here he illustrated theimportance of appropriate and justi ﬁed comparator selection.
A new intervention will look ‘better ’if compared with a poor control group than if the
comparator receives strong support. In the trial of therapeutic communities designed toreduce recidivism in delinquents, the control group were in the ‘control ’house. However
this control house had many defects and several of the sta ﬀwere arrested for abusing theHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOURAL MEDICINE 573
boys –hardly a typical control environment. But unless there is a good description of the
comparator, any success or failure of the new intervention will be hard to interpret.
The 2001 CONSORT statement, in Item 4 describing the intervention states:
Authors should describe each intervention thoroughly, including control interventions. The
characteristics of a placebo and the way in which it was disguised should also be reported. Itis especially important to describe thoroughly the ‘usual care ’given to a control group or an
intervention that is in fact a combination of interventions. (Moher, Schulz, & Altman, 2001 )
Nevertheless, it was not clear how a control group should be described as re ﬂected by
Freedland et al. ‘s(2011 ) analysis of the variety of possibilities for describing a ‘usual
care’control group. Freedland et al. ( 2019 ) has also discussed the issues to consider
when selecting as well as reporting control groups.
TIDieR emphasised the importance of specifying control groups content in as much
detail as the experimental intervention but even then, detail about active content could be
missed. Control groups vary enormously in the amount of active content they receive and
seminal work by de Bruin and colleagues demonstrate how important it is to take thatinto account when interpreting the results of BCI trials. The amount of active behaviour
change support given to control groups varies widely and when taken into account in
meta-regression, has been shown to a ﬀect the results of the trials (de Bruin, Viechtbauer,
Hospers, Schaalma, & Kok, 2009 ; Black et al., 2020 ). Control group support can explain
diﬀerences in outcome not only between di ﬀerent interventions but also between
diﬀerent control groups (de Bruin et al., 2010 ; Black et al., 2020 ). It is now clear that
the attention that is gradually being paid to the reporting of interventions needs to beapplied equally to the control groups.
Having learned so much, it has become apparent that more needs to be done to ensure
that BCIs can be delivered and reported in a manner which is replicable and whichpermits aggregation of evidence in a systematic and valid manner.
What we have still to learn …
Progress to date has exposed the de ﬁcits in previous BCI reports but additionally points
to what more needs to be done. Decisions need to be made about which interventionsshould be investigated and how to optimise resources (Armitage et al., 2021 ; Collins
et al., 2007 ). Surprisingly we continue to use as comparator control groups something
akin to ‘treatment as usual ’. This would be reasonable if absolutely no progress had
been made. Whereas there is usually some evidence of e ﬀective BCIs and surely this is
what any new intervention should be tested against. To some extent this may be what
is already happening as improved methods become part of usual care, but, unless thecontrol or comparator condition is well-described this will not be clear. If we were com-
paring a new intervention against a clearly speci ﬁed comparator, then we might begin to
use more Bayesian methods of analyses as we would be able to state the prior likelihoodof the comparator being successful and could make considered estimates of the likely
gains with the new BCI, rather than testing against a null hypothesis assuming no gain
in the comparator group.
However, even with the best of BCT taxonomies and the best CONSORT, TIDieR and
Cochrane reporting and synthesising, it is still the case that BCIs are incompletely574 M. JOHNSTON
reported and that the evidence used in designing BCIs and comparators is based on
incomplete or dated evidence. The e ﬀorts required to reshape the vast quantity of BCI
reports by getting additional information from authors and using taxonomies toconduct extensive annotations is barely feasible without using enormous resources,and even then the accumulation of evidence is likely to be too slow to be useful for prac-
tice and policy and too late to inform ongoing BCI design and evaluation.. It continues to
be diﬃcult to obtain the best synthesised evidence in a comprehensive and timely
manner.
The Human Behaviour-Change Project aims to overcome some of these problems by
developing a systematic method of ﬁnding published BCI reports, annotating the BCI
content, synthesising themand interpreting the evidence –all implemented by computer,
using machine learning and AI –and the results made accessible via a user-friendly user
interface (Michie et al., 2017 ). The ﬁrst step was the development of a BCI Ontology
(BCIO) to represent the information contained in the reports. An ontology includes
precise labels de ﬁnitions of all the ‘entities ’included and goes beyond a simple hierarchy
by allowing di ﬀerent kinds of relationship between entities and by ensuring interoper-
ability with other ontologies (Michie & Johnston, 2017 ). The complexity of BCIs is illus-
trated in the upper level of the BCIO where BCTs de ﬁne only one element of the BCI (see
Figure 1 ) (Michie et al., 2021 ). A report of a BCI should also specify the ‘dose ’delivered
and any tailoring to individuals as well as how it was delivered, when, how and by whom.The full BCI scenario also requires information about the context including the setting
e.g. clinical or educational, and the population, e.g. age, health-status, socio-economic
status. Each of these upper-level entities encompasses several lower levels. Forexample, the BCI setting has several layers of lower levels to describe where the
Figure 1. The Behaviour change Intervention Ontology Upper Level (Michie et al., 2021 )HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOURAL MEDICINE 575
intervention is delivered (Norris et al., 2020 ). BCTTv1 serves as the ontology for BCTs
but requires further development of the BCTs, the clarity of their de ﬁnitions and more
logical organisation of the relationships between them to perform as an ontology. Thefull BCI scenario includes the evaluation study presented as an ontology of the entitiesneeded to describe a competent evaluation such as a randomised controlled trial with
information about risk of bias.
The BCI Ontology has several advantages over a simple hierarchy. First, the entities
are precisely de ﬁned and so can be reliably identi ﬁed in reports and used more widely
by other researchers. Second, by using the BCIO to annotate many reports it is possible
to build up a body of annotated reports which can then form a basis for machine learningof the annotations and so by-passing the need for the massive human e ﬀort of extracting
key information from reports. Third, entities are linked by logical rather than empirical
relationships; it is therefore possible to add additional entities as they are identi ﬁed
without revising the whole structure. By contrast, the consensus methods used to
develop groupings of BCTs in BCTTv1 make it impossible to incorporate new BCTs
without repeating the empirical consensus clustering procedures which would almostinevitable result in di ﬀerent groupings. In BCTTv1, the labels for the groupings were
chosen to describe the content of each grouping whereas in an ontology, each BCT in
a grouping would relate logically to the upper level label. Fourth, the hierarchical struc-
ture ensures that ﬁndings that are valid for the upper levels have validity for lower levels
as the lower levels are contained within the upper levels; for example, a relationship that
applies to ‘children ’also applies to ‘younger ’or‘older ’children, as otherwise the relation-
ship would not be applied at the upper level. Fifth, the BCIO has clear linkage to otherrelated ontologies such as Cochrane ’s PICO ontology (O ’Connor, Green, & Higgins,
2008 ) which speci ﬁes population, intervention, comparison and outcome.
One challenge for the BCIO and for BCI research more generally is the problem of
deﬁning and classifying the target behaviour. Despite the study of behaviour being
part of most de ﬁnitions of psychology, the discipline has not developed a classi ﬁcation
of behaviours and it has even been suggested that it is avoiding behaviour (Baumeister,
Vohs, & Funder, 2007 ; Johnston & Dixon, 2008 ). Presseau et al. ( 2019 ) have proposed a
minimum description of the behaviours as AACTT (action, actor, context, target, time).
McEachan, Lawton, and Conner ( 2010 ) have proposed a classi ﬁcation based on repertory
grid and focus group studies; and Nudelman and Shiloh ( 2015 ) report a taxonomy of
behaviour clusters based on lay-people ’s perceptions of similarities between behaviours.
However, more work will be necessary to develop a satisfactory method of classifying
behaviours beyond their use in speci ﬁc domains and this is one of the challenges for
the HBCP.
In order to make progress in de ﬁning what must be extracted from reports, West is
developing methods of enhancing the reporting per se by developing a ‘Paper-Author-
ing-Tool (PAT) ’
and so reducing the need for complex methods of ﬁnding the infor-
mation in reports (West, 2020a ) with initial detailed methods for addiction studies
(West, 2020b ). Finally, current and future progress toward open science is fundamental
in making the evidence we report and synthesise available earlier and hopefully, morereplicable (Nosek et al., 2015 ).576 M. JOHNSTON
Conclusions
Obviously, it would have been much better to have known way back then what is now
widely known and has greatly improved the conduct and reporting of BCI evaluation
studies. But it would be even worse if we had made no progress over the intervention
years.
Major advances have been made in the design and reporting of BCI trials especially in
the use of RCTs, better speci ﬁcation and measurement of outcomes, advances in statisti-
cal methods and evidence synthesis. At a somewhat slower pace has been the clari ﬁcation
of methods of designing and reporting the BCI per se but CONSORT and extensions,
TIDieR and BCTs have all inched the ﬁeld forward albeit rather slowly for control/com-
parator conditions. Much remains to be done in all of these areas and the HBCP and PATwork, while exciting and innovative, underlines how far we need to go to get optimal useof reported BCIs. Hopefully in a decade or so of further progress, it will be possible to
reﬂect on how much better reporting and conduct of BCIs could have been in the
early 2020s.
And all of this progress is important –for the advancement of the science of behaviour
change, but also for addressing the accumulating social and health challenges that might
proﬁt from behaviour change solutions.
