Recognition that informal cancer carers experience unmet needs and psycholo-
gical distress has led to the development of a range of psycho-social interventions.
The efficacy of such interventions is examined through a systematic review of the
research literature, following National Health and Medical Research Council and
Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Of 13 level II randomised controlled trials
(RCTs), only eight showed significant differences across groups, with moderateeffect size. This included improvement in caregiver experience or appraisal of
caregiving following psycho-education (two studies); improved sexual satisfac-
tion, dyadic coping, relationship quality and communication, or reduced
psychological distress, following couple counselling (4); reduced distress following
family grief therapy (1); and reduction in distress in bereavement following home
palliative care (1). Level III and IV studies were also reviewed, reporting positive
effects of psycho-education (5), problem solving (3), an arts intervention (1) and a
support group (1). However, methodological concerns limit the generalisability of
findings of level III and IV studies. It is concluded that interventions should
target those most in need of support; recognise specific needs of carers across
cancer type and stage, gender and relationship context; be theory based; and
evaluations should utilise RCT designs with outcome measures appropriate to the
specific aims of the intervention, rather than global measures of distress.
Keywords: cancer carers; psycho-social interventions; systematic literature review;

The psycho-social needs of people with cancer have long been recognised, leading to
the development of an extensive range of supportive interventions (Newell, Sanson-
Fisher, & Savolainen, 2002). However, the needs of informal cancer carers have often
been overlooked, to the detriment of the well-being of both the carer, and the person
with cancer. There is now consistent evidence that informal cancer carers /C1the family
members and friends who provide both emotional and physical care for a person with
cancer /C1are at risk of experiencing anxiety and depression (Hagedoorn, Buunk,
Kuijer, Wobbes, & Sanderman, 2000; Haley, LaMonde, Han, Narramore, &
Schonwetter, 2001). Fatigue is also a common symptom reported among cancer
carers (Thomas, Morris, & Harman, 2002), as is insufficient rest, time for self-care(Ussher & Sandoval, 2008; Wellisch, Jamison, & Pasnau, 1978), and sleep problems
(Carter, 2003). In a number of studies, informal carers have been found to report

higher levels of cancer-related distress (Matthews, 2003; Matthews, Baker, & Spikers,
2003), or anxiety (Aranda & Hayman-White, 2001; Ferrario, Zotti, Massara, &Nuvolone, 2003; Given, Given, & Kozachik, 2001; Grimm, Zawacki, Mock, Krumm,& Frink, 2000), than people with cancer. It is also now established that women carersare at higher risk of distress than men carers (Hagedoorn, Sanderman, Bolks,Tuinstra, & Coyne, 2008).
The psychological and physical well-being of informal cancer carers is a
significant issue, for a number of reasons. Carers are often positioned by healthprofessionals as co-worker, rather than client (Payne, Smith, & Dean, 1999),expected to engage in a wide range of caring and quasi-medical tasks withoutsupport (Ussher & Sandoval, 2008) leaving their own needs unmet. Depression,anxiety and fatigue often renders the carer unable to provide the support needed(Christensen, 1999), resulting in greater burden on health and social services. At thesame time, the well-being of people with cancer is closely associated with the level ofsupport and care they receive from family and friends (Brown & Stetz, 1999), withgood support leading to positive outcomes. As the psychological well-being ofpeople with cancer is also closely associated with the well-being of their primarycarer (Hodges, Humphris, & Macfarlane, 2005), caring for informal carers is anessential part of caring for people with cancer.
This growing recognition of the needs of informal cancer carers has resulted in
the development of a range of supportive psycho-social interventions, which aim toimprove coping and psychological well-being, reduce distress and provide informa-tion. Recognising that a single approach will not be acceptable, or meet the broad
range of carers ’needs across cancer stage and type, these interventions incorporate a
variety of modalities and approaches, primarily within a psycho-educational,psychological or practical domain. However, knowing which interventions areeffective, and the extent of their impact in meeting carers ’needs, is a central question
which has not been fully addressed (Harding & Higginson, 2003). This knowledge iscrucial to the cost-effective development and allocation of services (Coyne & Lepore,2006) and the targeting of interventions to meet the needs of specific groups ofcancer carers (Carlson, Bultz, Speca, & St-Pierre, 2000). The paucity of rigorousresearch in this area led Harding and Higginson (2003, p. 63), in a review of theliterature prior to 2001, to conclude that ‘the current evidence contributes more to
feasibility and acceptability than to effectiveness ’. However, a substantial amount of
research has been published since the Harding and Higginson review, allowing firmerconclusions about effectiveness of certain interventions to now be drawn. Thepurpose of the present review is thus to systematically examine the efficacy ofpsycho-social interventions for reducing distress and improving coping in informalcancer carers and to outline the implications of the findings for future research andtheory in this field, as well as for the provision of supportive interventions.
Method
Database searches were undertaken in September 2006, and updated in October
2008. These were supplemented by hand searches of contents of journals, andreviews of reference lists of identified papers. The search engine used wasEBSCOHost, which accesses a range of databases, including Medline, PsychInfo,CancerLit and a range of others from nursing, health and psychology. Keywords86 J.M. Ussher et al.
used for the searches were cancer carer(s)/caregiver(s) intervention/support, cancer
couple intervention/support. Papers which reported evaluations of supportivepsycho-social interventions for informal carers of a person with cancer, or forcouples where one person had cancer, were included. Psycho-social interventionsunder three broad categories were identified: psycho-educational (both general andspecific problem solving); psychological (psychotherapeutic, problem solvingpsychological and support groups); and practical, or a combination of these
approaches. Couple or family interventions which only reported on the outcomes
for the patient, did not distinguish patient from carer outcomes, only provided dataon baseline, or post-intervention satisfaction, or where sample size precludedstatistical analysis, were not included in the review.
There are a number of recognised frameworks for making evidence-based
treatment recommendations, which propose a hierarchical ranking of evidence(National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC], 1999; Ropka &Spencer-Cisek, 2001). In the present review, all studies were rated following theNHMRC guidelines (see Table 1). Most highly valued (level I) are systematic reviewsof multiple, high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) /C1either a qualitative
integrative review, or a quantitative meta-analyses. The next level (II) includes atleast one well-designed randomised control trial; followed by a well-designed trialwithout randomisation (level III-1); comparative studies with concurrent controlsand allocation not randomised (cohort studies), case /C1control studies or interrupted
time series with a control group are rated level III-2; comparative studies with
historical control, two or more single-arm studies, or interrupted time series without
a parallel control group are rated level III-3; and case series, either post or pre-testand post-test are rated level IV .
Meta-analysis was considered, but deemed inappropriate (see Mohr, Judd, &
Terry, 1998), because of the variable nature and quality of the existing studiesincluding lack of consistency in interventions and outcomes, differences inparticipant eligibility criteria and length of follow-up periods, and availability ofsufficient detailed information in trials results (see also Newell et al., 2002). Instead,a systematic qualitative review of level II studies, high-quality RCTs, was conducted(Hunt & McKibbon, 1998) (Table 1). In order to provide a broad picture of thecurrent research knowledge in relation to psycho-social interventions for informalcancer carers, an evaluation of studies which would be rated as level III and IV usingthe NHMRC guidelines was also included (Table 2). This follows Barsevick,Sweeney, Haney and Chung (2002, p. 75), who included level III and IV studies intheir systematic qualitative analysis of psycho-educational interventions for peoplewith cancer, in order to provide ‘additional support ’for the evaluation of level II
studies.
In addition to each study being rated for level of evidence (Tables 1 and 2), the
methodological quality of each of the randomised controlled trials was alsoevaluated, using the guidelines recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration(Mulrow & Oxman, 1997). Following Newell et al. (2002), each trial was awardedthree points for fulfilling each of 10 criteria: adequate concealment of allocation;participants randomly selected; participants blinded to treatment group; care-providers blinded to treatment group; except trial intervention, other treatmentsequivalent; care-providers adherence monitored; detailed loss to follow-up informa-tion provided; percentage of participants not in the analysis; and outcomes measuredHealth Psychology Review 87

blind. The quality of a trial was considered good if it had a score of more than 20
points; fair if it had 11 /C120 points, and poor if it had less than 11 points (Newell et al.,
2002). Effect size was also calculated for the RCTs which had a significant positiveoutcome, and where sufficient statistical detail was provided, in order to provide anassessment of clinical importance of the results.
Overview of findings and discussion
Of 13 level II RCTs reviewed, five showed no significant difference across treatment
groups and eight showed significant effects, with moderate effect size. However, if weaccept the contention that only high-quality RCTs be considered in assessments ofefficacy of psycho-social interventions in oncology (Manne & Andrykowski, 2006), thepresent review would base its conclusions on the five RCTs which received a goodquality rating (21 and over) using the Cochrane criteria. This would result in theconclusion that there is very little evidence for the efficacy of psycho-socialinterventions in reducing distress and improving coping in informal cancer carers.Three studies showed no significant difference across treatment groups, followingproblem solving (Blanchard, Toseland, & McCallion, 1996), or supportive psycho-education interventions (Bultz, Speca, Brasher, Geggie, & Page, 2000; Walsh et al.,2007). Two studies showed minimal impact, reporting increases in sexual satisfactionfollowing couple counselling (Christensen, 1983) and reductions in general distress
following family focussed grief therapy (Kissane et al., 2006). Of the eight other studies
which would also be classified level II in the NHMRC ranking, and which received afair quality rating (11 /C120), two showed no significant effect following supportive
counselling (Goldberg & Wool, 1985; Kozachik et al., 2001). Modest positive effectswere reported from three couple-focussed interventions, in relation to improvements indyadic coping (Kayser, 2005), ratings of relationship quality (Kuijer, Ybema, Buunk,de Jong, Thijs-Boer, & Sanderman, 2000), and supportive communication, sexualadjustment, coping effort and psychological distress (Scott, Halford, & Ward, 2004).Supportive psycho-education interventions were reported to result in a more positivecaregiver experience (Hudson, Aranda, & Hayman-White, 2005), and less negativeappraisal of caregiving (Northouse, Kershaw, Mood, & Schafenacker, 2005), and homenursing palliative care was found to reduce psychological distress in bereavement(McCorkle, Robinson, Nuamah, Lev, & Benoliel, 1998).
The present review also considered 12 non-RCT level III and IV studies, which
did report positive results, across a range of domains. Psycho-education was reportedto result in increased knowledge (Ferrell, Grant, Chan, Ahn, & Ferrell, 1995;
Gagnon et al., 2002; Heinrich & Schag, 1985), improved self-efficacy in relation to
coping (Lewis et al., 2008) or decision making (Gagnon et al., 2002), improvedpsychological well-being (Ferrell et al., 1995; Lewis et al., 2008) and reduction incaregiver burden (Pasacreta, Barg, Nuamah, & McCorkle, 2000). Problem solvinginterventions were reported to increase knowledge and problem solving ability(Bucher et al., 2001), and to reduce emotional tension (Cameron, Shin, Williams, &Stewart, 2004). An arts intervention was reported to improve psychological well-being (Walsh, Martin, & Schmidt, 2004), and a support group improved maritalcommunication (Sabo, Brown, & Smith, 1986).
Positive results from level III and IV studies cannot be accepted without caution,
however, as few of these studies demonstrate methodological rigour. Limitations96 J.M. Ussher et al.
include the absence of standardised measures, no pre /C1post outcome measures or
absence of follow-up, no comparison or control groups, no information about
attrition rates and absence of information about participant eligibility. However,
RCTs are also not immune from methodological criticism. Small sample size is thenorm in all studies, level II /C1IV, increasing the likelihood of type II errors.
The Kissane et al. (2006) and Walsh et al. (2007). RCTs are the only studies which
met the recommended benchmark for evidence evaluation of over 100 participants
per group (Hardorn, Baker, Hodges, & Hicks, 1996). Whilst 100 participants pergroup may be unrealistic in many research contexts, power calculations can be
conducted, allowing estimates of the number of participants needed to have a 0.70
likelihood of detecting a moderate effect size. Few of the studies achieved this. Themajority of the reviewed studies also employed a relatively short follow-up period,which prevents assessment of the long-term effectiveness of interventions, and in
some studies participants in the control condition accessed psychological support as
part of usual care (e.g., Toseland, Blanchard, & McCallion, 1995), compromising therigour of the controlled trial design. The emphasis on positive results recorded on asingle outcome measure, in studies that used a range of measures, must also be
viewed with caution, as this precludes standard interpretation of significance levels
and increases the likelihood of a Type I error occurring.
There are a number of explanations for the paucity of significant findings in
relation to psycho-social interventions reducing distress and improving coping in
informal cancer carers. Whilst a number of informal carers experience elevated levels
of distress associated with the presence of cancer, many participants in cancer carerinterventions are described as highly functioning, and do not show elevated levels ofdepression, stress or burden (e.g., Christensen, 1983; Goldberg & Wool, 1985). This
confirms the suggestion that carers are not under stress when they access
interventions, rather that they are doing so to collect information in order toprevent future problems (Toseland & Rossiter, 1989). This can result in a ceilingeffect in relation to changes in psychological well-being. It has been suggested that
those who decline participation may be those most in need of support (Goldberg &
Wool, 1985). This appears to be borne out by the findings of Kissane et al. (2006, p.1216), who reported that the 66% of eligible families who declined to take part intheir family focussed grief therapy could be described as predominantly ‘chaotic/
alientated ’.
In recent reviews of the efficacy of psycho-social interventions for people with
cancer (Andrykowski & Manne, 2006; Barsevick et al., 2002), it was concluded thatwhen interventions are delivered to those with elevated levels of distress, the positive
effect of such interventions is more evident. Two studies contained in the present
review reported similar findings, suggesting that this may also be the case forinformal cancer carers. Kissane et al. (2006) reported that only families with highbaseline depression scores reported significant reductions in depression following
their family focussed grief intervention. Similarly, Toseland et al. (1995) only found
significant effects of their problem solving intervention for those who scored onestandard deviation below the mean on the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. This leads to
the conclusion that psycho-social interventions which aim to reduce psychological
distress should be targeted at those carers who have the most difficulty coping(Carlson et al., 2000).Health Psychology Review 97
The importance of establishing exactly what interventions can be expected to
accomplish, and tailoring outcome measures accordingly, is also paramount. It hasbeen argued that outcome measures currently used in cancer carer interventionresearch are measuring more global indices of burden, stress or depression (Harding& Higginson, 2003; Toseland & Rossiter, 1989), or measuring trait rather than statecharacteristics (Kissane et al., 2006), both of which would not be expected to changeover short periods of time. In many instances, caregiving demands increase over the
course of the cancer journey (Pasacreta et al., 2000), particularly for individuals
providing end of life care (Walsh & Schmidt, 2003), which could also confound anyprospective evaluation of psychological distress pre /C1post intervention. Rather than
focussing on global indices of distress, it may be more applicable to adopt a range ofmeasures appropriate to the specific aims of the intervention under investigation,such as increased knowledge or appraisal of caregiving following psycho-education,or relationship communication and satisfaction following a couple intervention.These were the constructs which showed significant positive change in the presentreview, with moderate effect size, in contrast to measures of psychological distresswhich largely showed no change. It has also been suggested that that psycho-socialinterventions with informal cancer carers should focus on maintaining quality of life(Northouse et al., 2005), on increasing positive emotions which can act as a bufferagainst stress (Hudson et al., 2005), or on developing skills for managing and dealingwith specific illness-related concerns in concrete gender-sensitive ways (Cochrane &Lewis, 2005), rather than on reducing psychological distress.
One factor which needs to be considered in evaluating psycho-social interven-
tions for cancer carers is the way in which participants are recruited for studies. It hasbeen suggested that ‘gate keeping ’of cancer carer access to interventions occurs via
organisations, patients and health professionals (Hudson et al., 2005), resulting inthe exclusion of those who might benefit the most. Participants are primarily madeup of those contacted through the person with cancer, who may decline involvement(Cochrane & Lewis, 2005), or those who volunteer to take part in response to a directapproach, with low uptake reported, 20 /C130% on average (e.g., Blanchard et al., 1996;
Bultz et al., 2000; Goldberg & Wool, 1985; Goldstein, Alter, & Axelrod, 1996; Keefeet al., 2005; Ostroff, Ross, Steinglas, Ronis-Tobin, & Singh, 2004; Sabo et al., 1986).One reason for low participation may be the use of the term ‘care giver ’,o r‘carer ’in
recruitment for studies, as many partners of a person with cancer, or those primarilyproviding emotional rather than physical support, may not identify with the term‘carer ’(Hagedoorn et al., 2008). The corollary to this is that participants who take
part in interventions on the basis of being the partner or first degree relative of aperson with cancer may not be a ‘carer ’(Hagedoorn et al., 2008), and thus may have
different concerns and needs to those who are in a caring role.
Reasons for non-participation in psycho-social interventions include carers
feeling that they do not need support, belief that they are coping well with managingthe illness, only wanting the intervention focus to be on the needs of the patient, andconcerns about leaving the patient alone (Harding & Higginson, 2003). This parallelfindings of research on cancer support group non-attendance more broadly (Buiet al., 2002; Ussher, Kirsten, Butow, & Sandoval, 2008; Winefield, Coventry, Lewis,& Harvey, 2003), and suggests that it should not be assumed that cancer carers willwant to avail themselves of interventions that are offered, and that this should berespected. Many carers adapt well to the illness and the caring role without having98 J.M. Ussher et al.
undertaken any psychological intervention (Goldberg & Wool, 1985; Weisman &
Worden, 1977). Equally, cancer carers consistently report that self-reliance andindependence are important values (Grande, Todd, & Barclay, 1997), and the reportsof negative effects of interventions in a proportion of studies (Jepson, McCorkle,Adler, Nuamah, & Lusk, 1999; Skilbeck et al., 2005) suggest that interventions arenot for everyone.
However, many informal cancer carers position their own needs or concerns as
irrelevant or insignificant in comparison to those of the person with cancer (Ussher& Sandoval, 2008). Their perception of the severity of their own distress may beunderestimated, leading to low motivation to attend to their own needs or to seekhelp, as predicted by the Health Belief Model (Janz & Becker, 1984). The provisionof information about the emotional and physical costs of caring, and about thebuffering effects of engaging in self-care or social support, may increase carerengagement with interventions. Equally, the high expectations placed on carers byhealth professionals and other family members (Soothill et al., 2003), may serve tocreate both a subjective and group norm which delegitimises carers articulating theirown needs, seeking help or engaging in self-care. Reducing the costs of engagementwith interventions, and greater social acknowledgement of carers needs, mayovercome such barriers.
It is important to note that regardless of the mode of intervention, participants in
psycho-social interventions report a high level of satisfaction (Bucher, Houts, Nezu,
& Nezu, 1999; Gilbar, 1997; Ostroff et al., 2004; Walsh et al., 2007), rating
interventions positively in terms of their usefulness (Bultz et al., 2000; Feldman,1993; Goldstein et al., 1996), their impact on experience of the rewards of caring(Hudson et al., 2005; Manne, Babb, Pinover, Horowitz, & Ebbert, 2004a) and onimprovements in communication and subjective well-being (Plant et al., 1987). Theinclusion of qualitative evaluations of subjective experience of intervention efficacyand process, alongside standardised instruments, would be a valuable addition tofuture research, as qualitative research can identify both mechanisms of change, andpreviously neglected variables for consideration in quantitative studies (Hagedoornet al., 2008). It is notable that two studies which adopted a qualitative methodologyreported improvements in psychological well-being (Grahn & Danielson, 1996;McLane, Jones, Lydiatt, Lydiatt, & Richards, 2003), suggesting that there may be adisparity between subjective evaluation of intervention efficacy, and changesrecorded on standardised instruments.
A number of further recommendations can be made for future research in this
field. The importance of targeting interventions to the needs of cancer carers has
been emphasised by many researchers (Goldberg & Wool, 1985; Harding &
Higginson, 2003; Hudson et al., 2005; Kissane et al., 2006). However, many researchstudies include both carers and people with cancer, with no attempt to tailor supportto their different needs, and in some instances, little or no differentiation betweenthem (e.g., Bucher et al., 1999; Feldman, 1993; Ussher, Kirsten, Butow, & Sandoval,2006; Wells, Hepworth, Murphy, Wujckik, & Johnson, 2003), or an overt focus onthe needs of the patient (e.g., Keefe et al., 2005). There has been little attempt torecognise the range of relationship types present in the informal cancer carerpopulation /C1which include spousal, friendship, parental, sibling and other family
relationships. The gender balance of carers participating in interventions has alsoreceived little attention. It is now well established that women cancer carers reportHealth Psychology Review 99
higher rates of depression and anxiety, and lower life satisfaction and quality of life
ratings, compared to men carers (Hagedoorn et al., 2008). Women have also beenfound to construct and experience the caring experience differently from men,leading to different patterns of coping (Ussher & Sandoval, 2008). However, nointerventions, to date, have targeted gender specific needs, and none have examinedgender differences in the experience or efficacy of interventions. Such research is longoverdue.
Equally, few studies include participants from a variety of cultural groups, those
with poor literacy skills, or English as a second language, limiting generalisability offindings to such groups (Hudson et al., 2005). The intervention needs and barriers toparticipation of carers in rural and remote areas has also been overlooked, despite theevidence that rural family caregivers experience greater burden, due to isolation andlimited resources (Conley & Burman, 1997). There are many areas of cancer carerneeds not incorporated in current interventions studies. One example is sexuality andintimacy issues, which are frequently identified as problematic for cancer carers(Hawkins, Ussher, Gilbert, Perz, & Sandoval, 2009), with negotiation of sexualmatters within the couple relationship often reported to be difficult (De Groot et al.,2005). This can have a significant impact on the well-being of the carer and the personwith cancer (Schober, 2004). Yet, to date, there has been no systematic evaluation ofinterventions to address cancer carer psycho-sexual needs, and there is a generalneglect of relationship issues in the majority of cancer carer interventions (Cochrane &Lewis, 2005). Another issue that needs consideration is the absence of research into the
caregiving experience for partners in same sex relationships, as health care practices
may not be attuned to the specific dynamics of gay and lesbian relationships, or toother social issues which may impact upon care (Kayser, 2005). Only one studyreviewed in the present paper reported attempting to include same sex couples in theirsample (Bultz et al., 2000), but they were not successful in doing so.
The relative efficacy of interventions for carers across different stages and types
of cancer, or the merits of focussing on single types of cancer versus mixed types, hasalso been neglected. The needs and concerns of cancer carers will vary depending onthe stage of cancer and prognosis, ranging from dealing with the shock of diagnosisin early stages, to anticipatory grieving in palliative care. However, many carerintervention studies do not specify cancer stage, and interventions are rarely targetedto meet the needs of carers at particular stages. Stage of cancer may also be a factorin recruitment, with some studies reporting higher take-up in carers of a person withnewly diagnosed or early stage cancer, in comparison to those at later stages orremission (Carlson & Strang, 1996). Equally, whilst many of the studies fail todescribe the breakdown of cancer types of the participants, those which do have
predominantly focussed on breast, lung and prostate cancer. For people with cancer,
interventions which focus on a single type of cancer (breast cancer) have been foundto be more effective than those that include a range of cancer types, and the trainingof the health professionals offering the intervention has also been found to influenceeffectiveness (Zimmerman, Heinrichs, & Baucom, 2007). Future research shouldsystematically compare the experience of carer interventions across cancer type andstage, and the mediators and moderators of effectiveness, including the professionalbackground of the service deliverer, in order to inform health professionals as to themost effective time, modality and content of delivery for these difference groups.Examination of the influence of other potential moderating factors, such as level of100 J.M. Ussher et al.
carer burden (Lutsky & Knight, 1994), activity restriction (Matthews et al., 2003)
and unmet needs (Allen, 1994), could also provide useful insight into the reasons whyinterventions may be effective for some carers, but not for others.
Interventions should also be based on a clear theoretical framework and a prior
needs analysis; this is not the case for the majority at present (Cochrane & Lewis,2005). Hagedoorn et al. (2008), in their recent meta-analysis of distress in couples
coping with cancer, suggest that research on stress in marital relations, on mutuality
of relationships, and on gender differences in coping in relationships, can be usefullyapplied to understand distress in couples coping with cancer. The positive effects ofcouple interventions on relationship and sexual satisfaction, as well as on couplecommunication and coping (Christensen, 1983; Kayser, 2005; Kuijer et al., 2000;Scott et al., 2004) suggests that this is an area deserved of further investigation.Conceptualising cancer as a relational experience, using a model of dyadic coping(Kayser, Watson, & Andrade, 2007), provides explanation for the finding thatinterventions targeting couples appear to be more effective than interventionsfocussing solely on the carer. This model draws on systemic-transactional theory(Bodenmann, 2005), to conceptualise coping as an interaction between the stresssignals and communication style of one partner and the coping responses of theother. Supporting this model, couples who are mutually responsive, attend to eachothers needs, and talk openly about their stress, have been reported to be able toengage in effective emotion and problem focussed coping in relation to cancer(Zunkel, 2002). This allows them to find benefits in the cancer experience, such as
personal growth and relationship closeness (Kayser et al., 2007; Manne et al.,
2004b). This pattern of mutual communication has also been found to be associatedwith lower levels of distress for people with cancer and their partners, and higherlevels of marital satisfaction (Badr, Acitelli, & Carmack Taylor, 2008; Manne et al.,2006; Ptacek, Ptacek, & Dodge, 1994). Conversely, many partners are overprotectivetowards the person with cancer, engaging in ‘protective buffering ’in an attempt to
prevent distress (Badr & Carmack Taylor, 2006; Kuijer et al., 2000), or ‘disengaged
avoidance ’(Kayser et al., 2007, p. 412), involving complete denial of cancer or its
effects. This is associated with higher levels of distress and lower marital satisfaction(Badr et al., 2008; Kuijer et al., 2000; Manne et al., 2006; Ptacek et al., 1994; Skerrett,1998; Zunkel, 2002), as well as less supportive behaviour within the couple (Manne,Ostroff, Winkel, Grana, & Fox, 2005). Longer-term follow-up of participants incouple interventions may thus produce findings of reduced distress, associated withimproved communication, coping and marital satisfaction.
However, not all informal carers are spouses. More broadly, Wuest ’s (1997, 2000,
2001) work on patterns of carer coping, and how these shift and develop across the
course of the caring relationship, could provide a theoretical framework for tailored
interventions across different stages of the cancer journey. Wuest (1997) argues thatthe initial caring stages are characterised by ‘fraying connections ’, involving daily
struggles, altered prospects and ambivalent feelings. For those carers who developadaptive methods of coping, this is followed by a stage of ‘precarious ordering ’,
involving setting boundaries, negotiating, and ‘re-patterning ’care/C1including
strategies such as anticipating, setting ground rules, juggling time, relinquishingand replenishing (Wuest, 2000, 2001). In a recent qualitative study of men andwomen cancer carers, the majority of women gave accounts which could becharacterised as ‘fraying connections ’, regardless of cancer stage, in contrast to theHealth Psychology Review 101
men carers who gave accounts of strategies of ‘re-patterned care ’, and reported
higher levels of psychological well-being and coping (Ussher & Sandoval, 2008).There is also evidence that women are more affected than men by the emotional well-being of others (Hagedoorn et al., 2001), or by life events, such as cancer, which
affect others (Kessler & Mcleod, 1984; Taylor, 2006). This is because a woman ’s sense
of self is conceptualised as ‘being in relation ’(Jordan, Kaplan, Miller, Stiver, &
Surrey, 1991; Miller, 1986), with mutual connectedness and the well-being ofsignificant others being central to identity. This reinforces the need for interventionsto be tailored to the specific needs of men and women carers, across stage of thecaring experience, as well as being based on a clear theoretical framework.
In conclusion, this absence of consistent positive findings, accompanied by
methodological problems, and moderate clinical impact, does not provide the body
of evidence to make reliable clinical recommendations to guide practice (NHMRC,
2000) in relation to the provision of psycho-social interventions to reduce distressand improve coping for informal cancer cares. This parallels the conclusions ofrecent reviews of psycho-social interventions for people with cancer (Coyne, Lepore,& Palmer, 2006; Newell et al., 2002), or partners of a woman with breast cancer(Cochrane & Lewis, 2005). Isolated studies which appear to reduce distress do notprovide sufficient evidence for the overall efficacy of this type of intervention, andconsideration needs to be given to possible adverse effects and the other costs of such
interventions (Coyne & Lepore, 2006). However, there is evidence that targeted
psycho-social interventions can be effective in facilitating change in areas such asincreased knowledge, relationship satisfaction or communication, appraisal ofcaregiver experience and distress following bereavement. Equally, carers subjectivelyreport benefit from engagement in interventions. Further rigorous research using aRCT design with adequate sample size is needed to evaluate which interventions arelikely to work for which carers, across types of cancer, stage of illness, gender,cultural group, level of distress and relationship with the person with cancer.
Interventions need to be based on a clear theoretical framework, with outcome
measures tailored specifically to the mode of intervention, rather than globalmeasures of distress. Without this research evidence, there is not a strong case to bemade for the development of specialised interventions which differ from theinformation and support that characterises ‘usual care ’.
