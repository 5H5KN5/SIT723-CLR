Abstract  
 Physical activity is associa ted with broad physical and psychological benefits in children 
and adolescents.  One construct which may universally characterize functioning across various 
pediatric populations is health -related quality of life (HRQOL).  A number of studies have found 
positive associations between physical activity and HRQOL; however, to date no systematic 
review and meta -analysis of physical activity and HRQOL has successfully quantified effects in 
children an d adolescents .  A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and ProQuest 
Dissertation Abstracts  identified 1081 relevant, non -duplicate articles.   Out of these pos sible 
articles, 33  studies, including both descriptive  and pre-post intervention designs, met inclusion 
criteria and were included in effect size analyses.  In descriptive  studies, there was a small, 
positive effect of physical activity on HRQOL based on child -reports ( Hedge’s g = .302, p < 
.001) and a negligible effect based on parent -proxy reports (Hedge’s g =.115, p =.101).  In 
intervention studies, there wa s a small, positive effect of  physical activity intervention  on 
HRQOL based on child -reports ( Hedge’s g = .279, p = .014) and a  medium , positive effect based 
on parent -proxy reports ( Hedge’s g = .522, p = .012).  However, effects are attenuated by 
removal of a single intervention study.  Overall, t hese findings supported the primary hypothesis 
that increased levels of physical activity would be related to better  HRQOL  in youth, although 
the magnitude of these effects did not represent a minimal clinically i mportant difference 
(MCID) in most studies .  Hypothesized moderators, including chronic disease status, weight 
status, sex, and study rigor, did not  significantly moderate the relationship between physical 
activity and HRQOL.  Exploratory analyses did not find intervention contact hours or age to 
moderate the effect of exercise on HRQOL.  Future studies are needed to assess HRQOL in 
youth before and after high -quality exercise interventions  to quantify the type, frequency, 
iv 
 
duration, and intensity of physica l activity needed to change HRQOL to a clinically meaningful 
level.  Although effects were small and analyses were limited, this study represents the first 
meta -analysis of physical activity and HRQOL across pediatric populations and may serve as a 
guide f or future studies.

Physical activity and health -related quality of life in children and adolescents : A systematic  
review and meta -analysis  
 The U.S. Department of Heal th and Human Services (2008) and the World Health 
Organization (2010) recommend that c hildren and adolescents achieve 60 minutes of moderate -
to-vigorous physical activity  (MVPA)  each day to optimize health benefits.  Unfortunately, only 
a quarter of all U. S. children and adolescents currently meet these guidelines (Dentro et al., 
2014).  Physical activity is associated with  a number of  positive physical health outcomes , such 
as maintaining a healthy weight  (Janssen et al., 2005) , developing strong bones  (Boreham & 
McKay, 2011) , and reducing the risk of chronic disease s and some cancers (US Department of 
Health and Human Services , 2008 ; Ekelund et al., 2012; Centers for Disease Control,  2015 ).  For 
example, a  recent meta -analysis of objectively measured physi cal activity found higher levels of 
child MVPA to be  associated with significant reductions in risk fact ors for cardiometabolic 
disease , including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and insuli n levels  (Ekelund et al., 2012 ).  Mirroring the literature on 
physical health, physical activity in children and adolescents is also linked to improved mental 
health  functioning, including  reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms  (Larun et al., 2006; 
Brown et al., 2013), improv ed cognitive function, and increased self -esteem (Biddle & Asare, 
2011).   
Beyond these specific  health associations, a number of studies indicate an association 
between physical activity  and health -related quality of life (HRQOL).  HRQOL is a description  
of holistic he alth that takes into account an  individual’s perceptions of physical, mental, and 
social functioning (Centers for Disease Control, 2011; Office of Disease Prevention and Health 
Promotion, 2015 ).  HRQOL is a patient -report ed outcome  that measures global health across 
2 
 
disorders and disciplines, mirroring  the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System ( PROMIS ) initiative developed by the National Institutes of Health to  improve patient -
provider communication and  disease management ( National Institutes of Health , 2017 ).  
HRQOL is a “unique indicator” of the impact of disease on individuals, which can be used to 
improve treatment effectiveness, patient -provider communication, clinical decision -making, and 
patient s atisfaction (Acquadro et al., 2003 , p. 524 ; Varni et al., 2005).  HRQOL provides 
interdisciplinary researchers and clinicians with a conceptual understanding of the subjective 
burdens associated with individual patient health  (Centers for Disease Control , 2011).   
Importantly, HRQOL helps to quantify individual  perceptions about  functioning , in 
addition to  objective functional ability  (Tsiros et al., 2009).  One may assume that a pediatric 
cancer patient currently undergoing chemotherapy  would report  poorer  HRQOL than a child 
struggling with excess weight that limits his or her mobility .  However, this assumption does not 
take into account the individual’s subj ective experiences and how these experiences  impact 
overall functioning.  According to Tsiros et al . (2009) : 
A health condition may cause significant impairments in body functions, although the 
individual may still be able to participate fully in community life and report positive 
HRQOL. In contrast, others with minor physical impairments may report sig nificant 
participation r estrictions and impaired HRQOL  (p. 388) . 
In fact, severely obese children report levels of HRQOL similar to pediatric cancer patients  
(Schwimmer et al., 2003) , illustrating the importance of assessing subjective  perceptions  of 
quali ty of life  as a measure of global functioning .   
Notably , HRQOL can be used  as a universal  construct to describe global functioning 
across disorders and disciplines , allowing the comparison of functioning across diverse 
3 
 
populations .  A number of HRQOL meas ures exist that are salient and  easy to use in a variety of 
settings  (Palermo et al., 2008 b).  For instance, a single -item measure of HRQOL (i.e. “In general, 
how would you rate your health?”) can differentiate a two-fold increase in mortality risk  in 
adults (DeSalvo et al ., 2006) , demonstrating  how a  simple  HRQOL measure can provide  
invaluable information for research and clinical applications .  
Physical Activity and HRQOL  
As a measure of perceived health, HRQOL should be highly related to the physical and  
psychosocial health outcomes that are positively impacted by physical activity  and described 
above.  At least one team of researchers have proposed a model for how physical activity may 
act through neurobiological, psychosocial, and/or behavioral pathways  to affect global well -
being (Lubans et al., 2016).  Lubans and colleagues (2016) suggested that being physically active 
releases neurotransmitters, improves mood, builds social connectedness, and increases sleep 
quality (as well as a variety of other mech anistic pathways), which interact to result in positive 
downstream effects on mental health and subjective well -being.   
Several  studies have assessed the associations between HRQOL and physical activity in 
children and adolescents, using both cross -sectio nal and longitudinal approaches.   For example, 
one large cross -sectional study of primary and high school students found an association  between 
greater self -reported physical activity in the past week and increased self-reported HRQOL 
(Chen et al., 2014).  Similarly, Dalton et al. (2011) reported a positive association between 
recalled physical activity in the past week and global HRQOL among a sample of children in 
middle school.   Consistent with these examples, the literature  generally indicates that higher 
levels of physical activity are positively associated with higher HRQOL  ratings  in children and 
adolescents  (Granger et al., 2017; Herman et al., 2014; Kantor et al., 2015; Lacy et al., 2012 ; 
4 
 
Lubans et al., 2016; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017 ).  There may even be a dose -response 
relationship between physical activity and HRQOL in children, with 12 year -olds reporting 1.5 -
2.6 unit increases in physical functioning HRQOL for each increased hour spent being physically 
active (Gopinath et al., 2012 ).   
Positive relationships between physical activity and HRQOL in youth appear to be 
replicated in longitudinal studies  as well .  For example, a longitudinal study of adolescents found 
those who maintained the highest levels of total physical activity ove r 5 years had significantly 
higher total, physical, and social HRQOL scores (Gopinath et al., 2012).  Higher baseline levels 
of HRQOL also predict ed future engagement in physical activity, up to 1 year later, for 
preadolescent children (Jensen et al., 2014 ).  These positive associations have been replicated 
across  ethnic groups , with at least one study finding associations between greater physical 
activity and higher HRQOL in Hispanic elementary school children (Kantor et al., 2015).   
Although a quantitati ve meta -analy sis was not located , several  related reviews  have 
examined associations between physical activity and mental health, subjective health, or 
psychosocial well -being in healthy youth and  adolescents  (Granger et al., 2017; Gu, 2017; 
Lubans et al.,  2016; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017).  Consistent with the literature 
summarized  above, these reviews suggest that physical activity is generally related to higher self -
reported health and psychological well -being ( Granger et al., 2017; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et 
al., 2017).  Notably, Granger et al. (2017) found  that physical activity was  positively related to  
self-reported health status in nine out of eleven studies.  However, only three of the  studies 
reviewed by Granger et al. (2017)  used v alidated measures of HRQOL, while the rest used visual 
analog scales or single -item ratings of perceived health.  Wong et al. (2017) also found that more 
time spent in MVPA was associated with higher HRQOL ratings in adolescents in 13 out of 15 
5 
 
studies.  However, the reviews described above were limited by a dearth of studies, a lack of 
objectively measured physical activity, high study heterogeneity, and inconsistent use of 
HRQOL and physical activi ty measures that restricted authors from determining aggre gate 
effects (Granger et al., 2017; Lubans et al., 2016; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017).   An 
additional review was severely limited because it did not  systematically review the literature 
(Gu, 2017) .   
The pri mary aim of this meta -analytic study  was to systematically review the literature 
and summarize the magnitude and direction of associations between physical activity and 
HRQOL in youth.  Meta-analyses contribute to the advancement of the scientific literature  by 
combining all published evidenc e on a topic, including contradictory and difficult -to-interpret 
evidence, into a single, comprehensive analysis  (Card, 2012 ; Chan & Arvey, 2012 ; Haidich, 
2010 ).  Meta -analyses  provide researchers and clinicians with organized, evidence -backed 
recommendati ons for direct clinical applications and benchmarks for evaluating future research  
(Card, 2012) .  A meta -analysis was  especially needed to combine findings about physical 
activity and HRQOL in youth because research i n this area has focused on diverse, spe cific 
pediatric populations, such as pediatric cancer survivors and obese youth.  To  date, findings have 
not been synthesiz ed across these specialty populations, making it difficult to compare the 
differential  effect s of physical activity  in specific pedia tric populations and  to generalize the 
effects of physical activity on HRQOL across  youth .  This meta -analysis is especially timely 
because HRQOL is becoming more widely used as a universal outcome measure of individual 
functioning across disorders  (Nation al Institutes of Health, 2017) .  Quantifying the magnitude of 
associations between physical activity and HRQOL across diverse populations of children and 
adolescents will inform universal interpretations of pediatric functioning in relation to exercise .  
6 
 
It was hypothesized that youth who we re more p hysically active would report significantly 
higher HRQOL  across domains  (i.e. HRQOL total score or global rating).  
Moderators  
The secondary aim of this review wa s to identify moderators of the relationship betwe en 
HRQOL and physical activity.  Moderator analyses  investigate disparate outcomes across studies 
by identifying predictors of relationship complexity that cannot be explained by a simple 
summary of  overall effects  (Card, 2012).  Previous reviews cited hig h between -study 
heterogeneity as a limitation, which could indicate the presence of moderators that accounted for 
study differences (Granger et al., 2017; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017).  Specifically, this 
review  examined  four a priori  moderator s, which were hypothesized to affect  the association 
between physical activity and HRQOL  including  chronic disease status, weight status, sex, and 
study rigor.  
Chronic Disease Status.   On first glance, it appears that a positive relationship exists 
between  physical activity and HRQOL for children with chronic conditions .  Previous studies 
with specific disease populations have found generally positive associations between physical 
activity and HRQOL  in pediatric cancer patients (Paxton et al., 2010) and chi ldren suffering 
from chronic pain (Lim et al., 2014; Palermo et al., 2008a) , mirroring associations seen in  
healthy youth.  Exercise interventions have  been shown to be effective for improving  HRQOL in 
children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (Verschur en et al., 2007), asthma (Flapper et al., 
2008), obesity (Knopfli et al., 2008), and depression (Daley et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2013).  
However, a dearth  of studies simultaneously investigated associations between HRQOL, 
physical activity, and health s tatus in both chronically disordered and healthy youth .  Children 
with chronic health disorders  typically report  lower HRQOL than healthy controls  (Varni et al., 
7 
 
2007); however, the impact of chronic illness  on the relationship between physical activity an d 
HRQOL in youth  remains unclear . This review aimed to be the first to examine  the differential 
impact of physical  activity on HRQOL across variou s chronic illness populations.  Children with 
physically impairing chronic disorders were predicted to  display  greater improvements in 
HRQOL after relatively minor increases in physical activ ity, while healthy children would  
require greater amounts of physical activity to achieve similar chang es in HRQOL.  This 
prediction was  built on the assumption that children suffering from s erious, chronic impairments 
would  be more positively impacted by minor returns to normalcy, such as engaging in small 
increases in physical activity (Speyer et al., 2010); whereas healthy children would  need to 
engage in higher levels of ph ysical activity (i.e. the recommended amount of 60 minutes of daily 
MVPA ; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008; World Health Organization, 
2010 ) to achieve similar benefits.   
Weight Status .  Weight status  was proposed as a separate moderator  due to the large 
proportion of the literature pertaining to HRQOL and physical activity in youth who are 
overweight or obese.  Similar to other chronic disease populations, y outh with 
overweight /obesity  consistently report l ower global levels of HRQOL tha n healthy -weight peers 
(Dalton et al., 2015; Herman et al., 2014; Lacy et al., 2012; Morales et al., 2013; Swallen et al ., 
2005; Tsiros et al., 2009) and significant improvements in HRQOL following physical activity 
intervention s (Finne et al., 2013; Knopf li et al., 2008).  However, children with 
overweight/obesity may experience additional stressors ( e.g. teasing) that can further reduce  
HRQOL scores at all levels of activity (Jensen et al., 2014).  An evaluation of weight statu s as an 
independent moderato r was  needed because  many physical activity interventions in youth with 
overweight /obesity  use control groups of only youth who are overweight /obese , thus failing to 
8 
 
show  whether children of healthy weight would experience a similar rate and magnitude of 
change in HRQOL.  One study which did compare  youth with overweight/obesity  and healthy 
controls found that weight status explained up to a third  of the variance in HRQOL, thus 
highlighting the importance of including this moderator  (de Beer et al., 2007).  It was  
hypothesize d that children with overweight /obesity  would  experience significantly greater 
changes in HRQOL from smaller alterations in physical activity than children of healthy weight.   
Sex.  Based on conflicting research about  the impact of gend er on both  physical activity 
and HRQOL  (Dalton et al., 2015; Ekelund et al., 2012 ; Herman et al., 2014; Lacy et al., 2012 ; 
Swallen et al., 2005 ; Kantor et al., 2015 ), sex was proposed as a nother potential moderator .  
Typical patterns of physical activity m ay vary across sex, with boys  engag ing in significantly 
more MVPA than girls (Ekelund et al., 2012).  Differences in amount of physical activity may 
relate to findings that both obese and healthy weight girls report ed poorer health  outcomes  and 
lower HRQOL  than boys in some studies (Dalton et al., 2015; Lacy et al., 2012 ; Swallen et al., 
2005 ).  However, girls reported  higher general, physical, emotional, and social HRQOL in at 
least one study  (Kantor et al., 2015).  In addition , some evidence suggests that  boys may be more 
sensitive to change s in physical activity  (Granger et al., 2017).  In one  study by Herman and 
colleagues (2014),  school -aged boys who did not meet physical acti vity guidelines or who fell in  
the lowest tertile of reported activity were 2 and 6 times  more like ly, respectively,  to report lower 
HRQOL scores ; this effect was not found for girls .  Unfortunately, these studies did not clarify  
how HRQOL may vary by sex, and how the relationship betwee n physical activity and HRQOL 
is affected  by sex.  Therefore, sex was included as an exploratory  moderator , but no explicit 
hypothes es were proposed for the m agnitude or direction of sex as a moderator between physical 
activity and HRQOL . 
9 
 
Study Rigor.   The final moderator evaluated was study  rigor .  Child and adolescent self -
reported physical activity shows only low -to-moderate correlations ( r = 0.3 -0.4) with objective 
measures of physical activity (i.e. direct observation, accelerometry) and self -reporters often 
overestimate the duration and intensity  of exercise (Ekelund et al. , 2011) , indicating that studies 
comparing HRQOL with self -reported physical activity may report artificially inflated results.  
Conversely, r andomized controlled designs  were expected to have lower between -study 
variability in outcomes than less tightly controlled designs (i.e. cross -sectional, matched groups).  
To account for the effect of these aspects of s tudy design, rigor was assessed using a version of 
the 18 -item rigor assessment created by Lundahl and colleagues (2010) a nd adapted by Mitchell, 
Amaro, and Steele  (2016 ).  This measure assigns points to studies based on design strengths, 
with higher scores indicating better study quality (Lundahl et al., 2010).  A composite score of 
study rigor was used to encompass expected  differences based on self-reported versus objective 
physical activity measures and other aspects of study design.  Studies of higher quality , including 
objectively measured physical activity  and more rigorous  designs,  were hypothesized to  show 
smaller ass ociations between physical activity and HRQOL , due to the greater homogeneity of 
findings expected in tightly controlled, rigorous studies  and smaller expected effects of objective 
measures . 
Summary  
The present study aim ed to synthesize the current literat ure on physical activity and 
HRQ OL in children and adolescents.  Effect sizes were  calculated to quantify the overall effect 
of physical activity on HRQOL in youth.  It was hypothesize d that children who engage d in 
greater amounts of physical activity woul d report significantly higher levels of HRQOL.  
Further , it was  predict ed that this relationship would be attenuated by moderator variables, 
10 
 
including chronic disease status, weight status, sex, and study rigor .  Chronic dis ease populations  
and youth with overweight/obesity we re predicted to exhibit greater HRQOL reactivity to 
relatively small changes in physical activity  (i.e. larger effect sizes) , versus children free from 
chronic illness and children of healthy weight.  In contrast, studies with more rig orous design 
quality (e.g. objectively measured physical activity) were expected to exhibit smaller effect sizes 
for HRQOL.  Based on  previous literature, the authors  expected changes in physical activity to 
produce disparate effects on HRQOL for boys vers us girls, but did not include an a priori  
hypothesis for the direction of this effect due to limited prior evidence.    
Methods  
Literature Search  
 The databases PubMed, PsycINFO , and ProQ uest Dissertations were  searched to conduct 
a comprehensive literatur e review  of both published and unpublished articles  about physical 
activity and HRQOL in youth .  Search terms  include d the keywords physical activ * OR exercise  
AND health related  qualify of life  AND child  OR adolesc ent OR youth  OR pediatric .  For 
PsycINFO , the age filter  was used to select articles pertaining to childhood (birth -12 years) and 
adolescence (13 -17 years), in place of  the keyword s child  OR adolescent  OR youth OR 
pediatric .  Forward and backward -searching, based on th e reference sections of incl uded  articles  
and relevant  reviews , was used to identify additional articles not yielded in the preliminary 
database search.   The initial literature search was conducted on March 26, 2016 and the search 
was finalized on July 26, 2017.  
Inclusion/Exclusion C riteria  
 To be included in the analysis, articles must have (a) been written in English, (b) 
available in full text, (c) include d participants with a mean age <18 years at the time of study 
11 
 
participation, (d) measured  target outcomes of  both physical activ ity and health -related quality of 
life or included a physical activity intervention with HRQOL outcomes , and (e) provide d enough 
information to calculate effect sizes .  Articles that measured physical activity in continuous units 
(e.g. minutes, steps, meta bolic e quivalent s [METs ]) or included an exercise intervention and 
reported  a total/global measure of HRQOL were included.  Articles that measured physical 
activity categorically ( e.g. Likert scale , met/did  not meet physical activity recommendations), 
articles that measured physical fitness but not physical activity , and articles that reported only 
specific domains of HRQOL ( e.g. psychosocial, physical, emotional) were excluded .  Duplicate 
articles from the same study were also excluded .  Authors were conta cted in an effort to include 
articles that appeared to measure target outcomes but did not initially provide enough 
information to calculate effect sizes.   
Two types of studies were included in this meta -analysis:  descriptive studies and 
intervention stu dies.  Descriptive studies included  non-intervention studies (e.g. cross -sectional 
surveys, observational studies, baseline characteristics only) that directly measured  associations 
between physical activity and HRQOL (e.g. Pearson or Spearman correlation,  regression ).  
Outcomes were aggregated for longitudinal studies that reported direct associations between 
physical activity and HRQOL  at multiple time points.  Descriptive studies that did not measure 
the direct association between physical activity and H RQOL (e.g. baseline means and standard 
deviations only, complex models that included other covariates) were excluded.  Intervention 
studie s had to include an exercise intervention (e.g. resistance training, aerobic fitness, physical 
activity education) and  measure  HRQOL values pre- and post -intervention  against  a comparison 
group .  Case studies and interventions that lacked a control group were excluded.   
 
12 
 
Coding of Studies  
 Two trained reviewers  (e.g. research assistants and graduate students)  independent ly 
reviewed article abstracts for inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Included articles were then reviewed 
in their full -text format by two trained reviewers and discrepancies were resolved by consensus.  
The first author coded all articles selected for inclusi on, and 20% of the final selected articles 
were coded by a second reviewer to establish coding reliability .  Each  study was coded for 
sample size, mean participant age, participant demographic characteristics ( e.g. sex, ethnicity, 
weight status, health sta tus), study method ( e.g. cross -sectional, longitudinal, intervention), study 
duration, assessment time points, measures used, physical activity measurement method (e.g. 
self-report, pedometer, accelerometer), mean p hysical activity , and total HRQOL.   EndNo te 
version X7  (Clarivate Analytics,  Philadelphia, PA)  was u sed to facilitate the organization  and 
coding of relevant articles.    
Study Rigor  
An 18 -point measure of study rigor, initially  developed by Lundahl et al. (2010) and lat er 
adapted by Gayes and Ste ele (2014)  and Mitchell, Amaro, and Steele  (2016 ), was used to assess 
study quality.  Points were assigned  for each aspect of study quality that was explicitly reported, 
such as describing three or more  demographic indicators of the sample, including multi ple sites, 
reporting study drop -outs, using objective measurement tools, and using randomization  to 
condition (for intervention studies) .  Points were summed and total s cores ranged from 0 -18, 
where higher scores indicate d greater study rigor.  A copy of t his measure is included  in 
Appendix A .  Twenty percent of articles were coded independently by two reviewers and the 
intra-class correlation coefficient for reliability across co ders for this instrument was .95 (ICC; 
95% confidence interval = .64 -.99).

Data Analysis  
Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge’s g to quantify the magnitude and direction of 
the associations between physical activity and HRQOL in youth (Durlak, 2009; Card, 2012).  
Hedge’s g was selected to best describe effect  sizes while corr ecting for study sample sizes , 
which varied from less than 20 participants per group to over 1000  participants  (Durlak, 2009; 
Hedges & Olkin, 1985).  Effect sizes for descriptive studies were calculated from measure s that 
directly associated physical activ ity and HRQOL, including bivariate Pearson correlations, t -
tests, and F -tests.  Effect sizes for intervention studies were calculated using pre -post means, 
standard deviations, and sample sizes for the intervention versus control group.  In select cases  
where pre -post standard deviations were not provided in the article , standard deviations were 
calculated from 95% confidence intervals.  
Four s eparate random effect s models  were used to  compute effect sizes in  descriptive and 
intervention studies, as well as child - and parent -proxy -report of HRQOL.  For instance, if a 
single study included both child - and parent -report of HRQOL measures, two effect sizes were 
calculated for this study to represent these quantifiably different outcome types.  If a single study 
included multiple outcomes from a single reporter  (e.g. multiple child -reported HRQOL 
measures), these data were averaged and aggregated for one overall effect size per study (Durlak, 
2009).  The Q statistic was calculated for all models to test for signif icant within -group 
variability (Card, 2012).  For models  with a significant Q statistic, analyses were conducted to 
examine the impact of hypothesized moderator variables on the relationship between physical 
activity and HRQOL, including chronic disease st atus, weight st atus, sex, and study rigor .  
Chronic disease status was categorized dichotomously as 1 (youth with chronic disease) or 0 
(typically developing youth).  Weight status and sex were tested as continuous moderators using 
14 
 
percent of the sample th at was overweight/obese and percent of the sample that was female.  
Study rigor was also tested as a continuous moderator  using study rigor scores from the  modified  
Lundahl assessment.  
Finally, the fail -safe N statistic was calculated to determine the numb er of non -
significant, excluded studies needed to reduce overall effect sizes to non-significance , as a 
measure of potential publication bias .  The  fail-safe 𝑁 statistic was calculated using the formula 
𝑁=𝑘(𝑀𝐸𝑆−𝐸𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛)
(𝐸𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛−𝐸𝑆𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑 ) ⁄  where 𝑘 was the number of studies, 𝑀𝐸𝑆 was the 
mean effect size, 𝐸𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 was the minimally significant effect size of 0.1, and 𝐸𝑆𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑑𝑒𝑑  was zero 
(Card, 2012).  Forest and funnel plots were created to graphically represent effect sizes and 
visualize publication bias.  Analyses were completed using Compr ehensive Meta -Analysis 
software  version 3 (Biostat, Englewood , NJ).  Effect sizes were interpreted using Cohen’s 
guidelines:  0.20 (small), 0.50  (medium), and 0.70 (large; Cohen, 1988; Durlak, 2009).  Results 
were evaluated at the p = .05 level, unless otherwise stated.

Search Strategy  
 The initial  key terms  literature search identified 1202 articles  from PubMed, PsycINFO, 
and ProQ uest.  After duplicates and non -articles (e.g. book chapters) were removed, 1081 unique 
articles remained .  Abstracts for each of these articles were screened for study 
inclusion/ex clusion criteria.  Abstract  screeners  had 62.9% agreement and interrater reliability 
was fair ( Cohen’s k = .232; Sim & Wright, 2005; Viera & Garrett, 2005 ).  Discrepant abstract 
screens were reconciled to 100% agre ement by consensus, leaving, 473  articles identified as 
potentially meeting inclusion criteria .  Of these,  471 were revi ewed in their full text format 
because two were  not available in full text .  Percent agreemen t on reviewing full texts was 91.5%  
15 
 
and i nterrater reliability was  moderate (Cohen’s k = .519).  Again, discrepancies for  full text 
reviews were reconciled to 100% agreement by consensus.  Forward  and backward searches 
identified an  additional  five articles that met full criteria.  Thirty -three  total studies met inclusion 
criteria, provide d enough information to calculate effect sizes, and were included in analyses.  
These included  14 descriptive  studies and 19 intervention studies.  A PRISMA of all articles 
assesse d during the review process and  detailed reasons for  study exclusion is provided in

Description of Included Studies  
  Descriptive  studies are summarized  in Table 1  and intervention studi es are summarized  
in Table 2 .  Descriptive  studies included youth ranging in age from 3 -18 years and all studies 
included a near -equal split of  males and females.  About half of the studies focused on children 
with a specific chronic disease, including ove rweight/obesity, cancer, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, 
and those who required a  kidney transplant.  Seven  of the studies used samples of typically 
developing youth and one included both typically developing and overweight/obese youth.  The 
majority of descrip tive studies were cross -sectional, either collecting data over less than a week 
or administering su rveys at a single time point.  One study included baseline data from a larger 
intervention, one  described longitudinal data from  the control group only of an  intervention, and 
one study described an intervention with no control group.  Over half of the studies quantified 
physical activity using subjective self -report measures, such as the Godin Leisure -Time Exercise 
Questionnaire  (Godin & Shephard, 1997; Godin , 2011)  and 7-day Physical Activity Recall  
(Sallis et al., 1993) .  Seven  studies used objective physical activity measures, including f ive 
studies that used pedometers a nd three studies that used ActiG raph accelerometers  (ActiGraph, 
LLC, Pensacola, FL) .  For HRQOL , the majority of studies used the Pediatric Qualit y of Life 
Questionnaire (PedsQL; Varni et al., 2003) , although two studies used the KIDSCREEN -27 
(Ravens -Sieberer et al., 2005; The KIDSCREEN Group Europe, 2006) , one used the KINDL -R-
Kiddo  (Ravens -Sieberer & Bullinger,  1998) , and one used the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire 
(CFQ -R; Quittner et al., 2005) .  The majority of HRQOL measures  were completed by children, 
although four studies also included parent -proxy report and one study relied on parent -proxy 
report alone.  Study rigor scores for both descriptive and intervention studies are listed in Table

Intervention studies included youth ranging in age from 3 to 18 years.  Most intervention 
studies included both males and females, although one study included females only.   The 
majority of intervention studies included chronic dis ease populations, including six  studies in 
youth with overweight/obesity, three  with ju venile idiopathic arthritis, two  with cerebral palsy, 
two with cancer, and one asthma .  Four studies used samples of typically developing youth and 
28 
 
 one included both typically developing and overweight/obese youth.  The majority of 
intervention  studie s were randomized controlled trials, three  were randomized pilot trials, two 
were non -randomized inter ventions, and one was a natural experiment  that studied existing 
differences in physical activity resources across schools.   Six studies included traditional group -
based exercise interventions (i.e. cardiorespiratory and /or resistance training) and five  were 
multicomponent obesity interventions which included exercise, diet, and education  components .  
The remaining interventions tested specific types of exercise, including  dance exergaming , 
physical education/YMCA activities, stationary cycling, Pilates, aq uatic exercises , and 
technology -based physical activity promotion .  Exercise interventions ranged from ten weeks to 
two academic  years in length with visits occurring <1 -3 days per week and each visit lasting 25 -
90 minutes.  The most common intervention le ngth was 12 weeks and intervention contact hours 
range d from 1.5-54 total hours (Mean = 24.58  ± 15.31; six studies did not report detailed 
information to determine total contact hours ).  Four  interventions were administered at the school 
level, while all o ther interventions enrolled participants individually.  Fifteen  studies compared a 
treatment group against a no treatment control group , usual care , or wait list ; four studies 
compared treatment to  an active control group that included education only or a different kind of 
exercise intervention.   
The majority of studies did not dir ectly measure physical activity .  For HRQOL, thirteen  
studies used the PedsQL  (Varni et al., 2003)  and one also administered the PedsQL Cancer 
module.  T wo studies each used the Dutch Children Quality of Life Questionnaire (DUX -25; 
Koopman et al., 1998) , the Pediatric Outc omes Data Collection Instrument ( PODCI ; Daltroy et 
al., 1998) , the KIDSCREEN  (Ravens -Sieberer et al., 2005; The KIDSCREEN Group Europe, 
2006) , and the Child Heal th Questionnaire (CHQ; Landgraf et al., 1996).  O ne study e ach used   
29 
 
 the DISABKIDS  (The DISABKIDS Group Europe, 2006) , the TNO -AZL Children's Quality of 
Life questionnaire (TACQOL ; Verrips et al., 1998; Vogels et al., 1998) , and the Juvenile 
Arthritis Qu ality of Life Questionnaire  (JAQQ ; Duffy et al., 1997) .  Six  studies assessed 
HRQOL using two or more measures.  The majority of intervention studies collected both child 
and parent -proxy report of HRQOL measures , while six studies included child self -report only 
and three studies included parent -proxy report only .   
Effect Sizes  
 Overall , descriptive  studies  demonstrated  a small, positive  association between  physical 
activity  and HRQOL based on  child -reports ( Hedge’s  g = .302, p < .001; Figure 2) and a 
negligible  (non-significant ) association  based on parent -proxy reports ( Hedge’s g = .115, p = 
.101; Figure 3).  Across studies, there was wide variation in child -reported effects.  One study 
found a large effect of physical activity on HRQOL (Woods, 2015) , four found medium  effects 
(Gu et al., 2015; Ha et al., 2015; Hamiwka et al., 2009 ; Paxton et al., 2010 ), three  studies found 
small effects ( Jalali -Farahani et al., 2016; Spengler & Woll, 2013 ; Standage et al., 2012) , and an 
additional f ive studies found negl igible effects (Boyle et al., 2010; Groenveld et al., 2012; Lim et 
al., 2014; Norris et al., 2010; Whitney et al., 2013) .  Importantly, three of these studies did not 
report exact statistic s, but merely stated that there was no significant association betw een 
physical activity and HRQOL ( Groenveld et al., 2012; Norris et al., 2010; Whitney et al., 2013).   
In an effort to include these null findings  in the analyses , correlations of zero were imputed for 
the three studies  with missing values.1 
  
                                                           
1 Studies with imputed zero correlations include standard error and variance estimates calculated from a 
Pearson correlation of zero and the study sample size.

Effect sizes from p arent -proxy reports in descriptive  studies were variable.  Although one 
study found a large association between  physical activity and HRQOL (Norris et a l., 2010), the 
remaining studies found non-significant associations  (Lim et al., 2014; Jalali -Farahani et al., 
2016 ; Michels et al., 2016).  Interestingly, Norris et al. (2010) found a large association  based on 
parent -proxy reports but no association betw een child -reported physical activity and HRQOL.

 Intervention studies  yielded  a small, positive  effect of physical activity interventions on 
HRQOL based on c hild-reports ( Hedge’s g = .279, p = .014; Figure 4 ) and a medium , positive 
effect of physical activity interventions on HRQOL based on parent -proxy reports ( Hedge’s g = 
.522, p = .012; Figure 5).2  Based on child -reported HRQOL, t hree studies found large , positive  
effects for their exercise interventions improving  HRQOL (Mendonca  et al., 2013; Flapper et al., 
2008 ; Taracki et al., 2012 ), four studies  found small effect s (Casey et al., 2014; Finkelstein et al., 
2013; Vos et al., 2012; Wafa et al., 2011) , six studies found negligible effects (Demuth et al., 
2012; Hofsteenge et al., 2013; Quaresma et al., 2014; van Dijk -Lokkart et al. , 2015; Wang, 2006; 
Wilson, 2010), and three  studies found small, negative effects (Azevedo et al., 2014 ; Mendoza et 
al., 2017; Takken et al., 2003 ). 
                                                           
2 Mendonca et al. (2013) reported findings over three standard deviations larger than  the average 
effect in both child and parent -proxy reported intervention models.  If this study is removed from 
analyses, the overall effect size for intervention studies based on child reported HRQOL is 
reduced to marginal significance ( Hedge’s g = .169, p = .052) and the overall effect for 
intervention studies based on parent -proxy reported HRQOL is reduced to a small, significant 
effect ( Hedge’s g = .261, p = .016).

Hypothesized Moderator s 
 The Q-statistic was calculated  for all four models (i.e. descriptive versus intervention; 
child report versus parent -proxy report) to test for significant sample heterogeneity, indicating 
the presence of between and within -study  variability that could be explained by  potential 
moderating variables.  Significant Q -statistics w ere found for the overall effect of physical 
activity on HRQOL in three of the four  models:  descriptive  studies using  child -report [ Q(12) = 
35.568 , p < .001], intervention stud ies using  child -report [Q(11) = 91.747 , p < .001] , and 
intervention studies using parent -report [Q(6) = 72.254 , p < .001] .  A non-significant Q -statistic  
was found for the parent -report ed descriptive  model [ Q(3) = 3.310 , p = .346], so this model was 
not included in moderator analyses.  
For the model s with significant Q -statistics , chronic disease status, weight status, sex, and 
study rigor were examined  as potential moderators.  Weight status was entered in a separate 
model  because it was reported for only about half of the studies , and thus would exclude half of

 the studies  from meta -regression analyses if it was included in the overall moderation model .  
Chronic disease status and weight status were  unable to be tested as moderator s in pare nt-
reported intervention studies because all of these studies were conducted in chronic disease 
sample s and only studies conducted in entirely overweight/obese samples reported on youth 
weight status .   
None of the tested moderators explained a significant  portion of between or within -study 
heterogeneity (all ps>.12; Table 4 ).  For descriptive studies based on child -reported HRQOL, 
visual inspection of non -significant trends suggested that studies with higher study rigor scores, 
studies in chronic disease s amples, and studies with more females frequently had larger effect 
sizes.  For intervention studies with child -reported HRQOL, non -significant trends were 
observed  for larger effect sizes in studies that included chronic disease samples, a larger number 
of overweight/obese youth, and more females.  A similar trend was seen for sex in the same 
intervention studies that utilized parent -proxy reported HRQOL.  However, these observations of 
non-significant moderators should be interpreted with caution, as these  trends were likely 
skewed by the low number of studies in each comparison.  No detectable trend was observed 
between study rigor and effe ct size the parent -proxy model.

Exploratory Analyses  
 While t he initial aim of this study was to characterize the association between physical 
activity and  HRQOL in descriptive studies, exercise  intervention s were adde d to increase the 
number of included studies and reach of this meta -analysis.  Although not hypothesized a priori , 
previous reviews have cited heterogeneity in exercise intervention duration, intensity, and 
frequency as possible con founders of intervention effectiveness (Granger et al., 2017; Lubans et 
al., 2016; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017).  Therefore, post hoc  analyses were conducted

 to examine  intervention contact hours as a proxy for exercise duration and frequency.  Thirteen 
out of 19 studies reported detailed information to calculate total intervention contact hours , 
which was tested in two models based on child - or parent -proxy reported HRQOL.  In both 
models, contact hours did not significantly moderate the effect  of physical activity intervention 
on HRQOL ( ps > .22; Table 5 ).    
Due to the broad range of child ages in included studies (3 -18 years), age was also 
examined as an exploratory post hoc  moderator.  All studies reported adequate information to 
include age  as a moderator, so it was tested in all models with significant Q statistics.  In all 
models, age was not a significant predictor of the association between physical activity and 
HRQOL ( ps > .43; Table 5 ).

 Publication Bias  
 Funnel plots for visual inspection of publication bias displayed notable gaps, particularly 
for descriptive  studies  (see Figures 6 -7).  Without imputed zero correlations for the three studies 
that found  no significant assoc iation between physical activity and HRQOL  but did not report 
exact values, there would be no studies in the lower left quadrant of the funnel plots, where 
highly non -significant studies would be expected.  However, these plots should be interpreted 
with c aution as gaps in models with less than ten studies may be due to a lack of studies, rather 
than true publication bias (Sterne et al., 2011 ).

 A fail -safe N statistic of 26.26 was obtained for descriptiv e studies using child report, 
0.60 for descriptive studies using parent report, 28.64 for intervention studies using child report, 
and 42.20 for intervention studies using parent report.  These statistics indicate that between 26 
and 42 additional non -significant studies would be needed to reduce the overall effect sizes to a 
negligible effect of 0.1 for three out of four models.  However, for descriptive studies that 
utilized parent -reported HRQOL, less than one additional non -significant study would be ne eded 
to reduce this effect size to 0.1, consistent with the already negligible effect size found for this 
model.   Removing the impact of the outlying study (Mendonca et al., 20 13) from analyses, 
failsafe N values drop to 10.35  for intervention studies usin g child report and 14.49 for 
intervention studies using parent report.  
Discussion  
The primary aim of this study was to quantify the magnitude of the association between 
physical activity and HRQOL in children and adolescents.  Physical activity is linked t o both 
physical and mental health outcomes in youth  (Ekelund et al., 2012 ; Larun et al., 2006; Brown et 
al., 2013)  and recent initiatives recommend  the use of HRQOL as a cross -disciplinary measure of 
subjective health outcomes ( NIH, 2017; CDC, 2011).  This  systematic review and meta -analysis 
aimed to be the first comprehensive examination of the relationship between physical activity 
and HRQOL across pediatric populations.  
Aggregate data demonstrated a small, positive effect of physical activity on HRQOL.  
More specifically, a small to negligible association  between physical activity and HRQOL was 
found across 14  descriptive studies , while a small to medium effect of  exercise intervention s on 
pre-post changes in HRQOL was found across 19 intervention studies .  However, among the 
intervention studies, a large portion of this effect was driven by a single study (Mendonca et al., 
41 
 
 2013).  When removed, the aggregate effect size across intervention studies was reduced to a 
small to marginal effect.  Generally , findings supported the primary  hypothesis that increased 
levels of physical activity would be related to better  HRQOL  in a limited way .  This finding 
matches previous systematic reviews of physical activity, health and, well -being outcomes in 
both adults (Biz e et al., 2007) and youth (Granger et al., 2017; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et al., 
2017).  In adults, Bize and colleagues (2007) identified significant positive associations between 
level of physical activity and HRQOL in five out of seven cross -sectional  studies, and positive 
effects of physical activity  on HRQOL in four RCTs .  In adolescents, Granger et al. (2017) found 
positive associations between physical activity and self -reported health status in nine studies and 
Wong et al. (2017) found that more t ime spent in MVPA was related to higher HRQOL in 
thirteen out of fifteen studies.  However, previous reviews in children and adolescents included 
highly heterogeneous studies and were unable to calculate overall effect size s; thus, this review 
extends the literature by  quantify ing the overall size of this effect  in youth.  Th e small  to 
marginal  positive effect found in this meta -analysis indicates that increasing physical activity 
may result in positive, but limited increase s in self-perceived health in children and adolescents . 
To better understand these results, the small overall effect was interpreted in light of t he 
minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) , which  is the smallest change in a target  
domain that is need ed for a patient to perceive a  change as clinically beneficial  (Copay et al., 
2007).  A  change above the MCID threshold would indicate a level of improvement in the target 
outcome that, in the absence of adverse side effects or unsustainable costs, would recommend a 
change in care, suc h as participation in a physical activity intervention to improve HRQOL.    
Recommended levels for the MCID  based on changes in HRQOL were developed by 
Varni et al. (2003) for the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory ( PedsQL ), the most commonly 
42 
 
 used measure of HRQOL in this review .  The PedsQL MCID was calculated using the standard 
error of measurement (SEM) , where one SEM represents  the MCID for clinical responsiveness 
to change in HRQOL  (Copay et al., 2007; Varni et al., 2003).  The recommended MCID for the  
PedsQL equates to a  pre-post change in HRQOL total score of 4.4 based on child report or 4.5 
based on parent -proxy report (Varni et al., 2003).  Of intervention studies included in this 
review, only three treatment groups saw improvements in HRQOL as meas ured by the PedsQL 
that would meet these MCID criteria based on child -report (Wafa et al., 2011), parent -proxy 
report (Yackobovitch -Gavan et al., 2009), or both (Mendonca et al., 2013).  In addition, at least 
one of these studies showed greater improvement  in the control group than the treatment group, 
although a clinically significant improvement was seen for the intervention group 
(Yackobovitch -Gavan et al., 2009).   Importantly, findings by Mendonca et al. (2013) represent 
an outlier that found larger eff ects of physical activity on HRQOL than other interventions.  
Therefore, in most cases, the small effect sizes seen following exercise interventions did not 
indicate a clinically meaningful improvement in HRQOL.  These findings suggest that existing 
physic al activity interventions may have positive, but limited effects on HRQOL.   
An additional way to interpret these results is using the number needed to treat (NNT), or 
the average number of participants needed to complete an intervention in order to have o ne 
successful outcome  (Kraemer & Kupfer, 2006 ).  NNT can also be operationalized as  the number 
of patients that would need to be treated (versus an untreated or alternative treatment comparison 
group) to see a difference in outcome ( Citrome , 2008 ).  The NN T calculated from effect sizes for 
intervention studies based on child report (Hedge’s g = .279) indicates that 14  patients would 
need to be treated with an exercise intervention to achieve a clinically significant improvement in 
one pati ent above and beyo nd that of a no -treatment or alternative intervention  control group.  
43 
 
 For intervention studies based on parent report (Hedge’s g = .522), 6 patients would need to be 
treated to achieve o ne participant with a significantly better outcome  in HRQOL beyond tha t of 
the control group.  This metric can help researchers and practitioners further understand the 
generally small effect  found in this meta -analytic review.  Overall, 6 to 14 patients may need to 
be treated with existing exercise interventions for one pat ient to achieve a m eaningful 
improvement in HRQOL .  If one outlying study is removed (Mendonca et al., 2013), these NNT 
numbers would increase  to 13 to 22 patients who would need to receive an exercise intervention 
for one patient to show a clinically rele vant improvement in HRQOL.  As discussed more fully 
below, t his indicates that existing physical activity interventions are not sufficiently effective to 
improve HRQOL for the majority of youth.  
The secondary aim of this review was to explore the impact of  moderators on the 
relationship between physical activity and HRQOL.  None of the a priori  moderators, including 
chronic disease status, weight status, sex, and study rigor, were found to significantly moderate 
the relationship betwee n physical activity an d HRQOL.  Additional post hoc examination s of age 
and total intervention contact hours  (as a proxy measure of e xercise duration and frequency)  also 
did not significantly moderate the effect of physical activity on HRQOL in intervention studies.  
Base d on pr evious estimations, it was  not surprising that these analyses failed to identify 
significant moderators, given the limited number of studies identified by this review that could 
be included in mode rator analyses  and differential study types (i.e. child ver sus parent -reported 
HRQOL , descriptive versus intervention  study  designs ) which required analyses to be conducted 
in four separate models.  For example, Groenveld et al. (2012, p.1841) estimated that “ the 
sample size needed to detect a small effect size [ for sex on HRQOL ] would be N  ~780,” while 
the median sample  size for included studies was approximately 87.  Limited variability in a 
44 
 
 priori  moderators across included studies, particularly for chronic disease status and weight 
status, further limited these  analyses.  The majority of included studies were conducted in youth 
with a chronic disease , indicating the need for high  quality studies in healthy youth that report all 
data necessary to calculate effect sizes.  Weight status was also not adequately repo rted in studies 
whose primary aims did not include assessing youth with overweight/obesity  or it was reported 
in a variety of formats that could not be directly compared (e.g. body weight, body mass index 
[BMI], BMI percentile, percent overweight/obese) .  Weight  status  may be an important 
demographic indicator to report systematically  in future pediatric studies.   Previous reviews were 
unable to calculate even overall effect sizes in children and adolescents due to high heterogeneity 
between studies (Grange r et al., 2017; Poitras et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017), indicating that 
additional moderators not assessed in this analysis could explain variability  between studies.  
 Although a priori  moderators were not significant, effect sizes did qualitatively vary  
across study type and HRQOL reporter.  In general, larger effect sizes (Hedges g = .279 -.522) 
were observed for intervention studies, indicating that HRQOL is a construct that can be 
positively altered by physical activity education and structured exercis e involvement.  Effect 
sizes were typically smaller in descriptive studies (Hedges g = .11 5-.302) where physical activity 
and HRQOL levels were measured concu rrently without intervention.  Aggregate e ffect sizes 
were more consistent across studies that use d child -report of HRQOL (Hedges g = .279 -.302) , 
while effect sizes based on  parent -proxy reports of youth HRQOL were more variable (Hedges g 
= .115 -.522).  The variability in effects based on parent -proxy reports of youth HRQOL could be 
due to the more lim ited number of studies that included parent -proxy reports in this review.  
Unfortunately, these qualitative variations were unable to be tested as quantitative moderators 
because the se differences existed across meta -analytic models , which would be inappro priate to 
45 
 
 directly compare (i.e. parent versus child -report; intervention versus cross -sectional study 
design).  
One possible explanation for the limited effect  sizes observed in this study requires a 
closer look at exercise interventions for youth.  Two pr evious reviews of exercise interventions 
in childhood found that physical activity interventions displayed small to negligible 
improvements in objectively measured physical activity immediately following or six months 
after an intervention (Metcalf et al.,  2012; Sims et al., 2015).  Average increases in activity level 
following an active intervention were only 4.47 minutes per day of total activity or 1.47 minutes 
per day of MVPA (Sims et al., 2 015).  With such small changes i n physical activity, it is not 
surprising that downstream effects on psychosocial outcomes like HRQOL would also be small.  
Some evidence suggests  a dose-response relationship  between physical activity and HRQOL, 
with 1.5 -2.6 unit increases in physical functioning HRQOL reported for eac h increased hour of 
physical activity (Gopinath et al., 2012).  However, this implies that adolescents would have to 
increase physical activity levels by over two hours per day to achieve a change in HRQOL 
commensurate with estimates for a cli nically meani ngful change (HRQOL t otal score difference 
of 4.4 -4.5; Varni et al., 2003) .  In contrast , physical activity guidelines recommend youth above 
six years to engage in only one hour of MVPA to achieve health -related benefits (U.S. 
Department of Health and Huma n Services, 2008; World Health Organization, 2010).  This 
disconnect between physical activity guidelines and amount of change in activity followi ng an 
exercise intervention will be  an important area for future research.    
Importantly, twelve out of 19 int ervention studies failed to objectively measure physical 
activity to determine whether interventions resulted in significant changes in physical activity.  
Ten of the studies did not measure physical activity at all.  Without direct measures of pre -post 
46 
 
 physical activity, small observed effects on HRQOL could be due to intervention failure (i.e. 
physical activity level did not actually increase), compensatory decreases in naturally occurring 
physical activity (e.g. Melanson et al., 2013), or low -level chang es in physical activity that were 
not large enough to achieve significant subjective health -related benefits.  As described in Sims 
et al., (2015), at least one study has successfully increased child physical activity by almost 60 
minutes (Araujo -Soares et  al., 2009), indicating that it may be possible for exercise interventions 
to increase activity to a level that could facilitate clinically meaningful downstream effects on 
psychosocial outcomes.  However, as demonstrated by the lack of physical activity m easurement 
in this meta -analysis, there is a  need for exercise interventions that objectively assess changes in 
physical activity and concurrent changes in HRQOL.  Subjective measures are not an accep table 
alternative as it is well -documented that subjecti ve measures of physical activity often 
overestimate duration and intensity (Ekelund et al., 2011).  Promisingly, research suggests that 
objective physical activity devices are  used in pediatric research, acceptable for youth wear, and 
increasingly affordab le (Bjornson, 2005; Cain et al., 2013; Van Coevering et al., 2005).  The 
increased use of objectively measured physical activity bodes well for a growing  number of 
studies that will have the capacity to relate objective changes in physical activity level t o 
HRQOL outcomes.  
Further complicating a more in -depth analysis of why physical activity interventions did 
not affect HRQOL in a clinically meaningful way, e xercise interventions included in this review 
were highly heterogeneous .  Included studies ranged from conventional cardiorespiratory and 
resistance training (e.g. Taracki et al., 2012; Van Dijk -Lokkart et al., 2015) to educational 
multidisciplinary treatments  (e.g. Vos et al., 2012; Wake et al., 2009)  to specific, alternative 
exercise types, such as P ilates and aquatic training  (e.g. Mendonca et al., 2013; Takken et al., 
47 
 
 2003) .  Differences in these types of exercise may help to explain differential effects of physical 
activity on HRQOL between studies.  For instance, interventions in this analysis wit h individual 
sessions including both cardiorespiratory and strength -training exercises (Taracki et al., 2012) or 
48 sessions of Pilates exercises (Mendonca et al., 2013) displayed the largest effect sizes.  While 
implementation of dance mats across schools  and aquatic exercise once a week displayed small 
negative effects (Azevedo et al., 2014; Takken et al. , 2003).  Consistent with the model proposed 
by Lubans et al. (2016), t his may indicate that factors such as type of exercise, number of 
training session s, and how the intervention was  administered had a large impact on the 
effectiveness of these interventions.  
To further assess why some exercise interventions resulted in larger effects on HRQOL 
than others, intervention contact hours were included as a pr oxy for intervention duration and 
frequency in this meta -analysis  post-hoc.  Although intervention contact hours did not 
significantly moderate the relation ship between physical activity  and HRQOL, analyses were 
limited by six out of 19 studies that failed  to report detailed information on intervention 
frequency and duration.  This may indicate disciplinary differences in the development, 
implementation, and reporting of exercise interventions for youth.  Studies that objectively 
assessed changes in physica l activity, had detailed descriptions of intervention methods, and 
provided scientific rationales for the intensity of training may have been less likely to include 
psychosocial measures like HRQOL and thus were not included in this review; whereas, 
psycho logically -minded researchers who included patient -reported outcomes like HRQOL may 
have been less likely to include rigorous exercise designs, true exercise interventions, or 
objective measures of physical activity.  A more in -depth examination of aspects of exercise 
interventions that could influence  their effectiveness for changing HRQOL was beyond the scope 
48 
 
 of this study , but should be a  focus of future meta -analytic reviews.  Future researchers may  
benefit from using the Lubans et al. (2016) mechanistic  model to develop structured exercise 
interventions in youth that are of adequate frequency, intensity, time, type, and context to 
facilitate meaningful changes in subjective psychological well -being and quality of life .  Future 
researchers may also benefi t from developing cross -discipline collaborations to overcome 
potential disciplinary gaps in intervention design and implementation.    
Finally, aspects of study rigor and systematic limitations in the existing literature should 
be considered when interpret ing these results.   Some aspects of study rigor were g enerally good 
across studies.  For example, a lmost all studies reported at least three demographic variables and 
most studies reported on intervention drop -outs or study completion rates.  Ove r half of the 
studies included multi -informant reports of HRQOL (i.e. child self -report and parent -proxy 
report), although these had to be analyzed in separate analyse s.  A fair number of studies  
included a minimum sample size  of at least 40 participants (or 20 part icipants per group) and 
most of the intervention studies used randomized controlled designs.   
However, studies were less likely to collect data from multiple sites, report use of a 
standardized treatment manual, or use blinded assessors.  No included stud y measured treatment 
fidelity.  Lower study rigor scores were observed across descriptive studies, generally, because 
some aspects of the study rigor coding were not present and automatically scored zero for studies 
that did not include an intervention .  In addition, some studies may have included additional 
aspects of study rigor but failed to adequately report each aspect in the published work, resulting 
in artificially lower scores.  For future studies, larger sample sizes and more consistent inclusion 
of both child and parent -proxy reported outcomes should continue to be a focus.  The main areas 
for improvement in study rigor are a need for the use of standardized intervention manuals and 
49 
 
 intervention fidelity checks, as well as better inclusion of blind ing to reduce the potential for 
biased outcomes by assessors who know the participant’s treatment allocation.  
Finally, although the initial search returned a high number of studies that included both 
physical activity and HRQOL, HRQOL was rarely compared d irectly to physical activity 
outcomes and was even more rarely a primary outcome.  For studies that did directly compare 
physical activity and HRQOL outcomes, many studies failed to report total HRQOL scores (e.g. 
reported subscale scores only) or reported  test statistics that were unable to be converted into an 
effect size (e.g. median, interquartile range).  Future research should aim to include validated 
HRQOL measures as a primary outcome, report on both sub -domain and total HRQOL scores, 
and report tes t statistics that are readily usable to calculate effect sizes.  
Strengths and Limitations  
Beyond the specific limitations of the literature noted above, t his study had a number of 
limitations. As with any meta -analysis, there was a risk that the literature  search did not capture 
all of the relevant literature .  However, the authors  tested and reviewed  search terms with 
colleagues  prior to conducting the final database search , conducted  forward - and backward -
searches to identify additional r elevant articles,  and contacted  authors for missing information to  
help ensure that the search returned  the most complete literature possible.  This study was also at 
risk for finding skewed (larger) effect sizes because it did not  include  unpublished works.  To 
counteract  this risk, the ProQ uest Dissertations database was used to find relevan t, unpublished 
dissertations  and theses  and the fail-safe N was calculated.  Based on the number of studies in 
this meta -analytic review, it is unlikely that an additional  10-42 unpubl ished,  non-significant 
studies exist that could  reduce the small, positive effect found in this analysis  to a negligible 
effect for three out of four models.   
50 
 
 Effect sizes may also have been impacted by the search criteria, which excluded 
interventions wi thout control groups and limited the types of HRQOL and physical activity 
measures  that could be included (e.g. validated HRQOL measures with total scores, no single -
item measures , physical activity in minutes or METs ).  However, these decisions were made in 
an effort to include higher quality studies that were directly comparable.  Importantly, overall 
effect sizes in intervention studies changed from small to marginal, and medium to small when a 
single study was removed from analyses (Mendonca et al., 201 3).  Several factors, including the 
nature of the sample (children with juvenile rheu matoid arthritis), the nature of the intervention 
(Pilates), and the number of exercise sessions may have individually or in combination resulted 
in larger than expected r esults in this study.  
Not all of the a priori  moderators could  be tested in each model due to a limited number 
of studies that provide d information on the proposed moderators  (i.e. weight status)  and the 
limited sample variability across some studies (i.e . all studies in a model conducted i n chronic 
disease populations).  Finally, the conclusions of this meta -analysis are only as accurate as the 
previously published literature.  Existing gaps in the literature , including a limited number of 
studies that di rectly measured  physical activity and HRQOL, published studies that included 
these variables but did not report usable test statistics , and limited research on physical activity 
and HRQOL in young children , were unable to  be rectified by this meta -analysis .   
In spite of these  limitations, this meta -analysis had  a number of strengths.  One strength 
was the broad sample of children and adolescents included in this review.  Previous 
investigations of physical activity and HRQOL have focused on  disorder -specif ic pediatric sub -
populations  or healthy youth only.  T his analysis provided the first  integration of previous 
research  that cuts across  pediatric populations  for a broader understanding of the relationship 
51 
 
 between physical activity and HRQOL in youth .  Another strength of this systematic review was 
the breadth of the literature  search , which included  1801 non -duplicate  articles from multiple 
databases , unpublished dissertations  and theses , and forward - and backward -searches to identify 
the most relevant lit erature possible.  In addition, t his review incorporated  a systematic coding 
scheme to assess study rigor  and statistical techniques , including a Q statistic and fail -safe N 
statistic , to evaluate the quality of the literature from which conclusions were drawn.  The 
authors  accounted for variations in study sample sizes and their potential impact on effect sizes 
by calculating Hedges g, rather than Cohen’s d, to reduce bias due to small sample sizes and 
overweighting due to large sample sizes.   Findings were also related to MCI D and NNT 
standards, to provide clinically relevant interpretation of the effects from intervention studies.   
Conclusion  
This synthesis of  the differential effects of physical activity on HRQOL across pediatric 
populations  revealed  a small  to negligible positive association between physical activity and 
HRQOL in descriptive studies, and a small to medium  positive  effect of physical activity on 
HRQOL  in intervention studies .  For intervention studies, overall effect sizes were largely 
impacted by a single intervention, and effects were attenuated if this study was removed.  
Overall , physical activity did not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect on HRQOL, 
implying that existing structured exercise interventions may not be of adeq uate intensity, 
frequency, duration, or type to significantly improve HRQOL in youth.  Although this  analysis 
was limited by wide variation in effects across individual studies and limited ability to detect 
moderators of this variability, this meta -analysi s was the first to quantify aggregate effects  of 
pediatric HRQOL  in relation to exercise.  As the use of patient -reported outcomes and HRQOL 
measures continues to increase  across disciplines  in response to  national health organization 
52 
 
 initiatives , addition al research is needed to consistently replicate findings for the relationship 
between physical activity and HRQOL in youth.  Additional research is needed to determine the 
level of physical activity that would be required to improve HRQOL in a clinically m eaningful 
way across both healthy and chronically ill pediatric populations.  Researchers should be mindful 
that the dose of physical activity needed to significantly improve psychosocial outcomes like 
HRQOL may not correspond exactly with current physical  activity guidelines for youth.  Most 
importantly, additional research is needed that objectively measures  the impact of exercise type, 
duration, frequency, and intensity on HRQOL  in children and adolescents.
