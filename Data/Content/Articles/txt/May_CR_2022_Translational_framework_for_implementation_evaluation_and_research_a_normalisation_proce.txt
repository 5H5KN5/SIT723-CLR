Abstract 
Background: Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) is frequently used to inform qualitative research that aims to 
explain and evaluate processes that shape late-stage translation of innovations in the organisation and delivery of 
healthcare. A coding manual for qualitative researchers using NPT will facilitate transparent data analysis processes 
and will also reduce the cognitive and practical burden on researchers.
Objectives: (a) To simplify the theory for the user. (b) To describe the purposes, methods of development, and 
potential application of a coding manual that translates normalisation process theory (NPT) into an easily usable 
framework for qualitative analysis. (c) To present an NPT coding manual that is ready for use.
Method: Qualitative content analysis of papers and chapters that developed normalisation process theory, selection 
and structuring of theory constructs, and testing constructs against interview data and published empirical studies 
using NPT.
Results: A coding manual for NPT was developed. It consists of 12 primary NPT constructs and conforms to the 
Context-Mechanism-Outcome configuration of realist evaluation studies. Contexts are defined as settings in which 
implementation work is done, in which strategic intentions, adaptive execution, negotiating capability, and refram-
ing organisational logics are enacted. Mechanisms are defined as the work that people do when they participate in 
implementation processes and include coherence-building, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive 
monitoring. Outcomes are defined as effects that make visible how things change as implementation processes pro -
ceed and include intervention mobilisation, normative restructuring, relational restructuring, and sustainment.
Conclusion: The coding manual is ready to use and performs three important tasks. It consolidates several iterations 
of theory development, makes the application of NPT simpler for the user, and links NPT constructs to realist evalu-
ation methods. The coding manual forms the core of a translational framework for implementation research and 
evaluation.

Contribution to the literature
• Normalisation Process Theory is widely used to design 
complex interventions, and to understand the dynam -
ics of implementation processes and their outcomes.
• Normalisation Process Theory has been developed 
through several iterations, and this paper consoli -
dates these into a single, empirically grounded, trans -
lational framework for implementation and evaluation 
research.
• This paper describes the development of a Normali -
sation Process Theory coding manual for qualitative 
research and instrument design, and it presents the 
coding manual ready to use.
• The coding manual links the primary constructs 
of Normalisation Process Theory to the Context-Mech -
anism-Outcome framework of realist evaluation.
Background
Any researcher who wishes to become proficient at 
doing qualitative analysis must learn to code well 
and easily. The excellence of the research rests in 
large part on the excellence of the coding.
Anselm Strauss [1]
The analysis and interpretation of qualitative data can 
make an important contribution to research on imple -
mentation processes and their outcomes when such 
data are interpreted through the lens of implementation 
theory. These data may be found in documents, inter -
view transcripts, or observational fieldnotes. In broad 
terms, there are two approaches to integrating qualitative 
methods and implementation theory. First, by explaining 
phenomena of interest through procedures that identify 
and characterise empirical regularities or deviant cases in 
natural language data through processes of induction [1]. 
Second, by deriving explanations of relevant phenomena 
through using structured methods of data analysis that 
directly engage with existing conceptual frameworks, 
models, and theories [2–5]. These are not mutually 
exclusive ways of working, and they are often combined. 
In this paper, we focus on developing tools for the sec -
ond approach, in which a more structured approach to 
qualitative data analysis [6] was formed into a coding 
manual that supports researchers using Normalisation 
Process Theory (NPT) [7–11] in studies of implementa -
tion processes.
NPT provides a set of conceptual tools that support 
understanding and evaluation of the adoption, imple -
mentation, and sustainment of socio-technical and organisational innovations. NPT takes as its starting 
point that implementation processes are formed when 
actors seek to translate their strategic intentions into 
ensembles of beliefs, behaviours, artefacts, and practices 
that create change in the everyday practices of others [8, 
11]. The central questions that follow from the applica -
tion of NPT are always, what is the work that actors do 
to create change? How does this work get done? And, what 
are its effects? Because NPT has its origins in research 
on the implementation of complex healthcare inter -
ventions, it does not see the intervention as a thing-in-
itself, but rather as an assemblage or ensemble of beliefs, 
behaviours, artefacts, and practices that may play out 
differently over time and between settings [8]. It is sup -
ported by empirical studies using both qualitative and 
quantitative methods and by systematic reviews that have 
explored its value in different research domains [12–14].
Development of the coding manual was informed by 
the application of methods of qualitative content analysis 
described by Schreier [2]. This approach can be defined 
as ‘a research method for the subjective interpretation of 
the content of text-data through the systematic classifica -
tion process of coding and identifying themes or patterns’ 
[3] and as ‘any qualitative data reduction and sense-mak -
ing effort that takes a volume of qualitative material and 
attempts to identify core consistencies and meanings. ’ [4]. 
As qualitative content analysis has become more widely 
used, so too have coding frameworks and manuals that 
define the ways that data are identified, categorised, and 
characterised within a study. In qualitative content analy -
sis, researchers are encouraged to develop manuals that 
describe and explicate definition of the ‘rules’ for coding 
and categorising data [5]. The process of categorisation 
that follows from using a coding manual is useful because 
it enables researchers to manage the cognitive burden 
of searching for and handling multiple constructs and 
thus enables them to manage a greater cognitive burden 
of interpretation. Within research teams, coding manu -
als support the quality and rigour of coding by provid -
ing ‘rules’ that are employed by each team member and, 
in this way, can ensure the consistency of coding. Parsi -
mony can be important too: more is not necessarily bet -
ter in qualitative investigation and analysis. Reducing the 
number of codes to those that represent core constructs 
can be understood as what Adams et al. [6], in a different 
context, have called ‘subtractive transformation’ .
A generalizable NPT coding manual is of value to 
researchers from a range of disciplines interested in the 
ways that implementation processes play out. It provides 
a consistent set of definitions of the core constructs of the 
theory, shows how they relate to each other, and enables 
researchers doing qualitative content analysis together to 
work within a common frame of analysis (for example, in

qualitative evidence syntheses, or in team-based qualita -
tive analysis of interview or observational data). In the 
future, as software for computational hermeneutics [15] 
becomes more widely available and practically workable, 
a coding manual could also be integrated into the devel -
opment of topic modelling instruments and algorithms.
Despite their value to researchers, the process of cre -
ating rigorous and robust coding manuals for individual 
studies is rarely described, and generalizable coding 
manuals are rare. In this paper, we start to fill this gap. 
We describe the purposes, methods of development, and 
application of a generalizable coding manual that trans -
lates NPT into a more easily usable framework for quali -
tative analysis.
Methods
NPT has developed over time through contact with 
empirical studies and evidence syntheses, and this has 
led to different iterations of the theory. These have been 
formed through publications that have served three pur -
poses. First, there is a set of papers aimed explicitly at 
theory-building in which core constructs of NPT have 
been developed and their implications explored [7–9, 
16, 17]. Second, there is a set of papers aimed explic -
itly at theory-translation in which those core constructs 
have been clarified and refined through methodological 
research leading to the development of toolkits [18, 19] 
and survey instruments [20–22]. Finally, there is a set of 
papers that contribute to theory-elaboration through the 
development of new constructs during empirical studies 
and systematic reviews. These explain additional aspects 
of implementation processes [23–25].
Translating a set of theoretical constructs into a the -
ory-informed coding manual for qualitative data analysis 
involves a series of tasks that are, in themselves, a form 
of qualitative analysis. Qualitative research focuses on 
the identification, characterisation, and interpretation 
of empirical regularities or deviant cases in natural lan -
guage data. The process described here developed organ -
ically and opportunistically through these different tasks, 
as they were conducted, and through discussion amongst 
authors of this paper. The work of defining key constructs 
of the theory, assembling these into a framework, and 
then transforming them into a workable coding manual, 
was informed by the qualitative content analysis proce -
dures described by Schreier [2].
 1. Concept identification. The result of the iterative 
development of NPT is a body of constructs rep -
resenting the mechanisms that motivate and shape 
implementation processes, the outcomes of these 
processes, and the contexts in which their users make them workable and integrate them into prac -
tice. These core constructs of NPT were distrib -
uted over papers that developed the theory [7–11, 
16, 17, 23–25] and in others that developed the 
means and methods of its application [18–22]. In 
June 2020, CRM assembled these constructs in a 
taxonomy of statements (n=149). They identified, 
characterised, and explained observable features 
of the collective action and collaborative work of 
implementation (the taxonomy of NPT statements 
is presented in the online supplementary material),
 2. De-duplication and disambiguation. The taxonomy 
of 149 statements assembled in selection and struc -
turing work included multiple duplicates, along 
with ambiguous and overlapping descriptions of 
constructs. CRM identified duplicate, ambiguous, 
and overlapping constructs. These were then either 
disambiguated or eliminated. After this work was 
competed, 38 discrete constructs were retained to 
make up a ‘first pass’ coding manual (the ‘first pass’ 
coding manual is presented in the online supple -
mentary material).
 3. Piloting. The ‘first pass’ manual was piloted. CRM 
used it to code two papers selected from an ear -
lier NPT systematic review. These were compre -
hensively coded and checked by all the authors of 
this paper, who critically commented on codes and 
coding decisions. The same coding manual was 
then applied to two sets of interview data collected 
in other studies that were informed by NPT. First, 
AG coded transcripts of interviews (n=55 with 
managers, practitioners, and patients) conducted 
for an evaluation of the accelerated implementa -
tion of remote clinician-patient interaction in a 
tertiary orthopaedic centre during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Second, KG coded transcripts of inter -
views (n=22, with community mental health pro -
fessionals) conducted for the process evaluation of 
the EYE-2 Trial (an engagement intervention for 
first episodes of psychosis employed in early inter -
vention in the community) [26].
 4. Further disambiguation. Pilot work demonstrated 
that the main elements of the ‘first pass’ coding 
manual were workable in practice. The piloting 
exercise revealed that the first pass coding manual 
was hard to use because it was over-complex and 
because it micro-managed the process of interpre -
tation. This defeated attempts at nuanced interpre -
tation. Additional work to disambiguate constructs 
and eliminate overlapping or redundant ones was 
therefore undertaken as we worked through steps 
5–8, below.

 5. Identification of context-related constructs. Within 
the coding manual the contexts in which imple -
mentation work takes place remained invisible, 
although taking context into account had been 
an important element of theory development and 
elaboration over time [10, 11]. The contexts of 
implementation can be understood as both  struc -
tures and processes [27]. To remedy the absence of 
constructs representing context, CRM returned to 
the taxonomy of 149 NPT constructs and the first 
pass coding manual and searched them for salient 
descriptors of context. Four of these were identified 
and were added to the manual.
 6. Further piloting. The four constructs relating to 
implementation contexts were piloted ‘in use’ by 
CRM on a set of interview transcripts (n=36) col -
lected in a study of professionals’ participation in 
the implementation of treatment escalation plans 
to manage care at the end of life in British hospitals 
[28]. It was found that these constructs character -
ised process contexts effectively.
 7. Presentation. The structure of the coding manual 
was then presented and discussed in a series of 
international webinars in February–April 2021. 
Discussion with participants in those webinars 
assisted in clarifying the ways that NPT constructs 
fitted together and characterised actual processes 
and outcomes.
 8. Agreement. Once the final structure of the cod -
ing manual was laid out, all authors then read and 
commented on it. This led to further ruthless edit -
ing and simplification of the coding manual.
 9. Post-submission. Journal peer review is intended to 
improve papers for publication. In this case, it led 
to a clearer and more coherent presentation of the 
methods leading to the development of the coding 
manual and of the coding manual itself. An impor -
tant outcome of this process was further simplifica -
tion of the construct descriptors in Tables  1 and 2. 
These were also linked to their primary sources in 
the NPT literature.
 10. ‘Living peer review’. Between the initial submission 
of a manuscript to Implementation Science (2 Sep -
tember 2021) and the finalisation of the manuscript 
(December 30, 2021), the first draft of the coding 
manual was viewed or downloaded more than 1600 
times from the preprint servers Resea rchSq  uare. 
com  and Resea rchGa  te. net . This led to useful feed -
back from researchers who began to use the cod -
ing manual to do ‘real-world’ data analysis as soon 
as it became available but who did not have spe -
cific NPT expertise. As a result of this ‘living peer review’ , further simplification of the descriptions of 
NPT constructs was undertaken by CRM.
Results: a coding manual for normalisation process 
theory
Working through the procedures described above led to 
part A of the coding manual for NPT. This is presented 
in Table  1 and consists of 12 primary NPT constructs. 
Although it was not originally intended to do so, we 
found that the final structure of the coding manual sits 
easily alongside the Context-Mechanism-Outcome con -
figuration of realist evaluation studies [54]. We describe 
this in Fig.  1. The array of primary NPT constructs took 
the following form.
1. Contexts are events in systems unfolding over time 
within and between settings in which implementa -
tion work is done (primary NPT constructs: strategic 
intentions, adaptive execution, negotiating capability, 
reframing organisational logic).
2. Mechanisms  motivate and shape the work that peo -
ple do when they participate in implementation pro -
cesses (primary NPT constructs: coherence-building, 
cognitive participation, collective action, reflexive 
monitoring).
3. Outcomes are the effects of implementation work 
in context—that make visible how things change as 
implementation processes proceed (primary NPT 
constructs: intervention performance, normative 
restructuring, relational restructuring, sustainment).
These 12 constructs form a general set of codes that can 
be applied to almost any textual data whether these are 
fieldnotes, interview transcripts, or published texts. They 
are all grounded in empirical research. Part A (Table  1) 
of the coding manual thus provides a general set of codes 
or categories that guide analytic work. Each construct is 
named and briefly described. Additionally, each descrip -
tor is accompanied by an example of the empirical appli -
cation of the construct in already published work. The 
aim of a coding manual is to provide guidance about how 
to interpret data that is often highly nuanced and repre -
sents complex and sometimes very dynamic processes 
at work. However, no theory, framework, or model can 
generate a set of codes that will infallibly cover all pos -
sible features of data. In this case, guidance about inter -
pretation, rather than scriptural authority, is the primary 
intention of our coding manual. Detailed guidance on the 
process of coding can be found in work by Strauss [1] and 
Schreier [2].

Table 1 NPT coding manual part A: primary constructs—contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes
CMO domain NPT construct Description and example
Implementation contexts:
Contexts are patterns of social relations and struc-
tures that unfold over time and across settings. They 
make up the implementation environment.Strategic intentions [11] Description: How do contexts shape the formulation 
and planning of interventions and their components? 
[11].
Example: ‘The analysis centres on English primary care 
and in particular on the issue of how healthcare profes-
sions are affected by, and in turn affect, the interpreta-
tion and adoption of new services. We use the case of 
the implementation of evidence-based approaches for 
managing patients with osteoarthritis. This muscu-
loskeletal problem occurs in a high proportion of GP 
consultations, and is projected to increase due to a 
rapidly ageing population in the western world’ [29].
Adaptive execution [10] Description: How do contexts affect the ways in 
which users can find and enact workarounds that 
make an intervention and its components a workable 
proposition in practice? [11].
Example: ‘Huge effort was expended and continues 
to be required to implement and keep this technology 
in use. This innovation must be understood both as a 
computer technology and as a set of practices related 
to that technology, kept in place by a network of actors 
in particular contexts. While technologies can be ‘made 
to work’ in different settings, successful implementa-
tion has been achieved, and will only be maintained, 
through the efforts of those involved in the specific 
settings and if the wider context continues to support 
the coherence, cognitive participation, and reflective 
monitoring processes that surround this collective 
action. Implementation is more than simply putting 
technologies in place – it requires new resources and 
considerable effort, perhaps on an on-going basis’ [30].
Negotiating capacity [10] Description: How do contexts affect the extent 
that an intervention and its components can fit, or 
be integrated, into existing ways of working by their 
users? [11].
Example: ‘Aligning IPC guidelines with local clinical 
context is an essential means to reduce the sense 
of dissonance and represents a critical step forward 
towards successful implementation. Some strategies 
described in the literature to promote alignment 
include: integration of IPC recommendations within 
other established programmes; and education and 
audit interventions acknowledging the positive and 
negative beliefs of staff on IPC practices [31].
Reframing organisational logics [10] Description: How do existing social structural and 
social cognitive resources shape the implementation 
environment? [11].
Example: ‘The external and internal partnership build-
ing were key and also strategic, so as not to impose 
ERAS but to co-create it from the ground up. This 
relational work, as framed in the NPT, is deceptively 
complex as it involves convincing others that this is a 
legitimate improvement programme worth participat -
ing in without devaluing their current practice and 
beliefs. The interprofessional and interdepartmen-
tal relationships the champion teams established 
appeared to lay an important foundation for accepting 
changes and the data reports as meaningful and 
embedding ERAS into everyday practice’ [32].

CMO domain NPT construct Description and example
Implementation mechanisms:
Mechanisms are revealed through purposive social 
action—collaborative work—that involves the 
investment of personal and group resources to 
achieve goalsCoherence building [7] Description: How do people work together in every-
day settings to understand and plan the activities that 
need to be accomplished to put an intervention and 
its components into practice? [11].
Example: ‘Coherence was achieved around the CDSS 
despite local context variation. Across all three sites 
there was agreement that the CDSS was suitable for 
the (varied) tasks and that appropriate resources were 
in place to enable effective implementation, although 
these varied between settings. There were differences 
between settings where the CDSS replaced an estab -
lished system with existing staff and where the service 
and/or the staff were new and the work of establish-
ing coherence had to be altered to reflect this. It was 
clear that knowledge, experience and work identities 
built through doing call-handling work influenced 
the coherence of the CDSS for staff in the different 
settings. What is especially interesting in the wider 
policy context – where this same CDSS is now being 
used to support a national ‘111’ urgent care service (...) 
is that coherence was not just a local ‘problem’ , it was 
necessarily underpinned by wider understandings and 
discourses for example about the necessity of rationing 
and the need to modify caller/patient behaviour and 
beyond that the very legitimacy of evidence based 
medicine and the kinds of expert knowledge which 
underpinned the CDSS’ [30].
Cognitive participation [7] Description: How do people work together to create 
networks of participation and communities of practice 
around interventions and their components? [11]
Example: ‘Cognitive participation relates to the work 
that participants undertake to build up and sustain 
a community of practice around an intervention. In 
terms of CST, participants identified training as an 
important factor in generating their own and their 
colleagues’ interest in CST and thus ensuring all stake -
holders were involved. Staff were further motivated 
to continue running the groups within their service 
through observing the direct beneficial effects of CST 
on clients’ [33].
Collective action [7] Description: How do people work together to enact 
interventions and their components? [11].
Example: ‘The daily tasks involved in carrying out 
Point of Care (POC) testing were deciding which tests 
(if any) to take for each patient when they arrived; 
communicating this to others; taking the blood; run-
ning the tests; examining the results; communicating 
the results to others; and deciding what action to 
take accordingly. This work was allocated to different 
staff according to their skills and availability. Close 
teamwork appeared key to ensuring that each task was 
performed by an appropriate person at the necessary 
time’ [34].Table 1 (continued)

CMO domain NPT construct Description and example
Reflexive monitoring [7] Description: How do people work together to 
appraise interventions and their components? [11].
Example: ‘Data provision by the laboratories proved 
to be difficult despite the standardized format. The 
database manager at the central level reported he had 
to put much effort in getting the data from the system 
administrator from the laboratories because they did 
not prioritize data delivery. It was reported by them 
that saving the data extraction queries, as the research 
group suggested, for use in the next time period was 
increasingly helpful in the course of the implementa-
tion period. By fine-tuning these queries after each 
extraction, the quality of the delivered data improved’ 
[35].
Implementation outcomes:
The practical effects of implementation mechanisms 
at workIntervention performance [6] Description: What practices have changed as the 
result of interventions and their components being 
operationalized, enacted, reproduced, over time and 
across settings? [11]
Example: ‘The bed-monitoring technologies were felt 
to be useful in helping staff identify patterns in resident 
behaviour and explore reasons for these behaviours. 
The bed sensors at Sycamore Lane were capable of 
recording clinical data such as heart rate, but the 
manager reported that “it’s not something that we 
use readily” , and this functionality was never observed 
in use during the present study. The location-based 
system at Conifer Gardens was similarly able to record 
data, including information about resident mobility 
activity. This functionality had initially been anticipated 
as potentially useful for enhancing clinical understand-
ing, however, the Occupational Therapist reflected that 
the time needed to analyze and interpret these data 
had been “a job in itself” and thus has been difficult 
to integrate into daily practice. There were questions 
about the clinical utility of some of the data, which 
appeared to become more pronounced when consid-
ering the financial expense of the technology’ [36].
Relational restructuring [10] Description: How have working with interventions 
and their components changed the ways people are 
organized and relate to each other? [11].
Example: ‘The CMs became “everyday representa-
tives” for the secondary sector and were responsible 
for acting as bridge- builders between hospital 
psychiatry and general practice. Previous research on 
Nurse Practitioners/ Advanced Nurse Practitioners in 
general practice (...) has shown that if the clinics are not 
involved at an early stage and prepared thoroughly for 
the Nurse Practitioner’s arrival, their integration in gen-
eral practice is hampered. Preparation involves practi-
cal issues, a clearly defined role for the nurse practi-
tioner, and organizational leadership, meaning that 
the managers of the responsible organization must be 
involved in the process of defining and supporting the 
role (...) The challenges also pointed towards a lack of 
managerial co-ordination of, and responsibility for, the 
practical issues associated with the CM’s role in general 
practice. (...) This meant that on many occasions, the 
CMs had to take on the role of implementation ambas-
sadors assuming responsibility for maintenance of the 
collaborative care model’ [37].Table 1 (continued)
Page 8 of 15 May  et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:19 
CMO domain NPT construct Description and example
Normative restructuring [10] Description: How have working with interventions 
and their components changed the norms, rules and 
resources that govern action? [11].
Example: ‘The first theme, trusting and embedding 
new relationships, is a reminder that while locally-led 
innovation is designed to address local problems, 
convincing others of its value is core work. This is 
particularly so when the innovation challenges profes-
sional norms and involves changes to traditional deliv-
ery models and renegotiation of professional roles (...). 
In this case, the findings are consistent with previous 
research which has indicated that the success of such 
innovations is dependent on the trust of all involved 
and the credibility of clinicians (...)’ [38].
Sustainment (normalisation) [6] Description: How have interventions and their com-
ponents become incorporated in practice? [11].
Example: ‘At the end of the project period, the path-
way was integrated in daily practice in two of the six 
municipalities. In these municipalities the care pathway 
was found to have the potential of structuring the 
provision of home care services and collaboration with 
the GPs, and serving as a management tool to effect 
change and improve knowledge and skills. (...) The 
generic care pathway for elderly patients has a poten-
tial of improving follow-up in primary care by meeting 
professional and managerial needs for improved 
quality of care, as well as more efficient organization of 
home care services. However, implementation of this 
complex intervention in full-time running organiza-
tions was demanding and required’ [39].Table 1 (continued)
More granular possibilities are presented in part B 
(Table  2) of the coding manual. Here, the four NPT 
primary constructs related to mechanisms  of purpo -
sive social action (coherence-building, cognitive par -
ticipation, collective action, reflexive monitoring), 
each possess four associated secondary constructs. 
These secondary constructs provide further and 
equally empirically grounded codes where the available 
qualitative data support interpretation at that level of 
detail. Once again, each construct is named and briefly 
described, and each descriptor is accompanied by an 
example of the empirical application of the construct in 
already published work. However, the use of these 16 
secondary constructs in coding is not mandatory, and 
many papers included in systematic reviews [12– 14] of 
NPT studies seem either to have treated them as dis -
cretionary or not referred to them at all. They are how -
ever valuable and important, and thus have explanatory 
value, because the mechanisms that motivate and shape 
implementation processes are often those that are 
mobilised to overcome perceived problems of context. 
In NPT, analysis always focuses on purposive social 
action—the work that people do to enact evidence or 
innovation in practice—and for this reason, focusing attention on the constructs that characterise action is 
central to the interpretive task.
Discussion
The purpose of developing this coding manual was to 
clarify and simplify NPT for the user and to make it 
more easily integrated and workable in research on the 
adoption, implementation, and use of sociotechnical and 
organisational innovations. In qualitative content analy -
sis—as in other forms of qualitative analysis—prolifer -
ating constructs can easily make the business of coding 
ever more microscopic and can mean that it becomes less 
analytically rewarding. Indeed, the more parsimonious a 
prescheduled theoretical structure is, the more space it 
provides for nuanced interpretation and the development 
of novel categories of data and the analytic constructs 
that can be derived from them.
In the development of the NPT coding manual 
described here, we sought to eliminate ambiguity and 
add workability from the outset. The process of selection 
and structuring we describe yielded a set of 12 primary 
NPT constructs (Table  1: coding manual part A) and 16 
sub-constructs (Table  2: coding manual part B). As Fig.  1 
shows, these identify, characterise, and explain the course

Coherence: How do people work together to under -
stand and plan the activities that need to be accom-
plished to put an intervention and its components into 
practice? [11].Differentiation [7] Description: How do people distinguish interventions and 
their components from their current ways of working? [40].
Example: ‘In order to invest in ERAS individuals needed to 
be able to differentiate its practices favourably with those 
enacted pre-implementation. This required coherence work 
in understanding the potential patient benefits allied to 
its introduction. Participants provided divergent accounts 
when they compared ERAS to previous practice. A number 
of participants asserted that the introduction of ERAS had 
brought about considerable changes to their day-to-day 
practice. These changes included positive adjustments in 
the management of patients and required patients to play 
a more active role in their own recovery’ [32].
Communal specification [7] Description: How do people collectively agree about the 
purpose of interventions and their components? [40].
Example: ‘Another barrier to coherence was lack of com-
munal specification, since not everyone considered they 
had been informed about the study or understood its aims 
and processes. This caused implementation problems 
for the homes and the research team. For the homes, the 
researchers’ reasons for examining potential benefits from 
the intervention to have a positive impact on the culture of 
care had not been strongly reflected’ [41].
Individual specification [7] Description: How do people individually understand what 
interventions and their components require of them? [40].
Example: ‘One respondent felt discussing the new way to 
view the patients with the staff was a delicate issue. In the 
old care model, patients were usually only informed about 
the treatment whilst now, in the care model, patients were 
to be seen as partners. This was regarded as a shift in power 
and, at least for some physicians, it would be difficult to get 
used to’ [42].
Internalisation [7] Description: How do people construct potential value of 
interventions and their components for their work? [40].
Example: ‘At this stage (initial introductory meetings), the 
value of the intervention was purely based on individuals’ 
interpretation of the information given by the research 
team and the “fit” with their own interests. The GPs in 
General Practice 8 provided their views at the end of the 
introductory meeting, saying that they liked the structure 
and more systematic approach to caring for people with 
OA and concluded that “it is nice to be able to try some -
thing that may make a difference”’ [43].
Cognitive participation:
How do people work together to create networks of 
participation and communities of practice around inter -
ventions and their components? [11]Initiation [7] Description: How do key individuals drive interventions 
and their components forward? [40]
Example: ‘Participants described the new SDM work as 
requiring leaders to define the work, and then enrolling 
others to contribute collectively to the process. Identifying 
leadership support for SDM was challenging: clinical teams 
are not simple hierarchical units, and substantial autonomy 
exists, especially for experienced clinicians’ [44].
Enrolment [7] Description: How do people join in with interventions and 
their components? [40].
Example: ‘Clinic participants also re-ported that the inter -
vention provided a model for improved interprofessional 
team collaboration, resulting in a greater understanding of 
clinicians’ roles and skill sets. Huddles were viewed as worth 
creating and maintaining, both for interprofessional team 
and patient benefits. Participants identified that the major -
ity of patients were satisfied with the interprofessional 
approach to primary care’ [45].

Legitimation [7] Description: How do people agree that interventions and 
their components are the right thing to do and should be 
part of their work? [40].
Example: ‘The respondents offered several explanations for 
resistance or lack of engagement: some staff felt that health 
promotion activities overstretched users’ resources and 
thus had a negative impact on their quality of life; others 
argued that health promotion activities did not respect 
personal preferences of users and staff (…) One of the 
important implementation ideas (…) was the concept of 
staff being role models for health promotion. As role mod-
els staff were[ expected to participate in different health 
promotion activities (like joining users for walks and meals) 
and to display a healthy lifestyle at work. In the four provid-
ers, such expectations were formulated and formalised by 
management or by key implementation staff to different 
extents. However, in all cases some staff did not buy into 
this idea; they felt that the elements of smoking cessation 
and healthier meals interfered with their usual lifestyle and 
personal preferences’ [46].
Activation [7] Description: How do people continue to support interven-
tions and their components? [40].
Example: ‘While, overall, this system has worked well, many 
participants referenced instances of long wait times and 
rerouting of calls to reach the neonatologist. Based on the 
care teams’ appraisal and experience with this process, they 
suggested modeling the teleneonatology service activa-
tion after the emergency department’s response system, 
for immediate and direct connection. Other suggestions 
include making the technology simple enough for ease of 
use, and to mount a camera (which can be controlled by 
the remote neonatologist) to the baby warmer’ [47].
Collective action:
How do people work together to enact interventions and 
their components? [11].Interactional workability [7] Description: How do people do the work required by 
interventions and their components? [40].
Example: ‘The rural allied health team indicated that 
telehealth technology provided ‘a whole range of other 
capabilities’ , and considered it ‘safe and it’s appropriate 
and it’s an equivalent, if not better, sort of service that 
you can provide’ . They were committed to the notion that 
telehealth could balance the unequal access to services 
across geographical locations, and were keen to pursue 
innovative ways of using telehealth technologies to allow 
them to provide complex distant therapy. In contrast to 
rural and experienced telehealth clinicians who were keen 
to utilise technology as part of their role and to deal with 
distance and isolation, urban clinicians with no exposure to 
telehealth reported more reservations about the safety and 
suitability of providing rehabilitation through telehealth. 
They generally felt that telehealth should be reserved for 
‘people who are more autonomous and more capable and 
… straightforward’ , rather than ‘real’ rehabilitation patients 
with complex issues. They felt that people who required 
rehabilitation often require a ‘hands on’ approach’ [48].

Relational integration [7] Description: How does using interventions and their 
components affect the confidence that people have in 
each other? [40].
Example: ‘Enhanced collegial discussion about FV and 
adherence to the safety measures, such as the home 
visiting policy and procedures introduced in (…) model, 
were important for nurses to feel safe and undertake the FV 
work. As implementation progressed, intervention nurses 
felt safer than comparison nurses when attending home 
visits (…). Relationships within teams and with FV services 
varied across the MCH intervention teams. High workloads, 
time constraints and a lack of nursing staff or relievers in 
some centres impacted on the organisation of the FV work 
at times. The nurse mentor role to provide secondary con-
sultation, linkage to FV services and support for other MCH 
nurses had varied success. Due to time constraints and the 
often solo nature of MCH practice, most nurses preferred 
to discuss clinical issues with a nurse friend or co-worker at 
the time rather than try to contact the designated MOVE 
nurse mentor, with only 38% of nurses using the nurse 
mentor role early in the trial. This increased to 52% as time 
went on. If the nurse was not comfortable speaking and 
had insufficient time or access to the nurse mentor, then 
this aspect of the model was lost’ [49].
Skill-set workability [7] Description: How is the work of interventions and their 
components appropriately allocated to people? [40].
Example: ‘A key theme identified in the literature and 
through this study is the need for more training for 
practitioners. This includes training both in professional 
education and continuing educational opportunities for all 
practitioners. Medical, nursing and allied health education 
programs need to improve LGBT curriculum content (…). 
Providing education on general terminology, healthcare 
needs specific to the transgender population, and practi-
tioners’ role in providing healthcare for this population will 
better prepare new practitioners for serving this commu-
nity. Increased access to continuing education with LGBT 
content will help to increase the knowledge and skill of cur -
rent practitioners. Embedding LGBT content within current 
programs of continuing education may increase awareness 
more than having specific LGBT courses (…). Embedding it 
in current programs may bring awareness to the concepts 
and highlight the need for practitioners to seek out more 
specific training to address their learning gaps’ [50].Table 2 (continued)

NPT construct Sub-construct Description and example
Contextual integration [7] Description: How is the work of interventions and their 
components supported by host organizations? [40].
Example: ‘Since POs were able to self-select into the pilot, 
the alignment of PO priorities with participation in a pilot 
on care management was a good fit. The leadership in 
all POs voiced interest in providing care management to 
patients within their PO as a means of improving patient 
outcomes, easing burden on providers of handling 
complex patients, and to meet health care standards and 
reimbursement policies such as patient-centred medical 
home recognition, accountable care, and meaningful use. 
Therefore, in this study overall organizational support was 
not found to be variant. Where organizational support 
emerged as an issue related more to resources and support 
for the care management program relative to the needs 
and goals of the program. The most common issue here 
was not having either enough care managers or enough 
care manager protected time to do care management for 
the number of patients needing it. So in well-normalized 
programs, there was a sense of “rationing” of the care 
manager. Because the program was being used so much 
more and there was a capacity constraint at the practice 
level with the practice-based care manager structure, the 
practices in these POs voiced more concern about lack of 
care manager capacity. Lack of resources was evident in 
other ways such as lack of space for patient visits or access 
to phone lines to make longer calls’ [51].
Reflexive monitoring
Description: How do people work together to appraise 
interventions and their components? [11].Systematisation [7] Description: How do people access information about the 
effects of interventions and their components? [40].
Example: Feedback was never provided to staff on the 
effect of the AKI e-alert “I haven’t had any feedback since 
the new version (of the AKI e-alert) went in actually(...) I 
don’t know whether there is a formal mechanism for that 
getting to anyone”’ [52].
Communal appraisal [7] Description: How do people collectively assess interven-
tions and their components as worthwhile? [40].
Example: ‘The e-alert was rarely (if ever) discussed among 
clinicians, but participants often stated they felt that others 
would find it worthwhile. “The e-alert was rarely (if ever) 
discussed among clinicians, but participants often stated 
they felt that others would find it worthwhile. “Most people 
I’m sure would know it’s a good idea having them. That’s 
what I’d say to someone about these alerts”’ [52].
Individual appraisal [7] Description: How do people individually assess interven-
tions and their components as worthwhile? [40].
Example: ‘A key barrier which has not previously been 
identified concerned the ability of case managers to 
identify, and act on, emerging patient and carer needs; 
we identified examples of missed and unmet needs for all 
three case managers. One case manager explicitly attrib -
uted this to the timing of the intervention; a study of case 
management for people with early symptoms of dementia 
and their carers similarly found that case managers did not 
feel the intervention was needed at this point’ [53].
Reconfiguration [7] Description: How do people modify their work in response 
to their appraisal of interventions and their components? 
[40].
Example: ‘Aligning IPC guidelines with local clinical context 
is an essential means to reduce the sense of dissonance 
and represents a critical step forward towards successful 
implementation. Some strategies described in the literature 
to promote alignment include: integration of IPC recom-
mendations within other established programmes; and 
education and audit interventions acknowledging the posi-
tive and negative beliefs of staff on IPC practices’ [31].Table 2 (continued)

of implementation processes through which strategic 
intentions are translated into practices and enable under -
standing of how enacting those practices can lead to dif -
ferent outcomes, and to varying degrees of sustainment.
Coding is a centrally important procedure in quali -
tative analysis [1], but it must be emphasised that it is 
only one part of a whole bundle of cognitive processes 
through which researchers make and organise mean -
ings in the data. Here, a coding manual cannot cover all 
analytic possibilities presented by a qualitative data set. 
Reflexive procedures for identifying phenomena outside 
the scope of a theory, developing new codes, and linking 
them to other explanatory models are always important 
in theory-informed qualitative work. The act of cod -
ing involves descriptive work that is a foundation for the 
interpretation of data, but it is not a proxy for it nor is the 
purpose of a coding manual to verify the underpinning 
theory. The whole purpose of coding, and of linking cod -
ing to theory, is to build and inform interpretation and 
understanding. This is not a discrete stage in data analy -
sis but is continuous throughout [1].
Linking NPT to the CMO model of realist evaluation 
did not happen by accident. NPT was developed through 
a series of iterations that were already heading in this 
direction. This began with empirical studies that led to 
rigorous analysis of the mechanisms  that motivate and 
shape implementation processes [7, 8]. As the theory was 
developed and applied, further consideration was given 
to the problem of contexts [9, 13, 16] and to the ques -
tion of how mechanisms interact with contexts to pro -
duce specific outcomes [11, 24, 25, 55]. At the same time, 
systematic reviews [12–14] revealed that the use of NPT 
was impeded because researchers without a strong theo -
retical background in the social sciences needed both 
clearer definitions of constructs and a conceptual toolkit 
that linked these together in a way that enabled them to 
see how implementation mechanisms and contexts inter -
act with each other to shape different kinds of outcomes. 
Drawing these together in a single-coding manual would 
assist in solving these problems.Strengths and limitations
We describe a set of methods likely to be useful be use -
ful to qualitative researchers in other areas of research 
who wish to consider developing such manuals for 
other theories (for example, relational inequalities 
theory [56] or event system theory [57]). A strength of 
the work was that developing the coding manual was 
undertaken by an international multidisciplinary team 
working with personal experience of developing and 
working with NPT and with other implementation 
frameworks, models, and theories. This ensured that 
from the outset the development of the coding manual 
was closely linked to knowledge about the ways that 
NPT can be used. An unanticipated consequence of 
the coding manual being published on preprint serv -
ers (ResearchSquare.Com and ResearchGate.Com) was 
that other researchers started to use it almost immedi -
ately and quickly fed back criticism or encouragement. 
This added value to both the development process and 
the final product.
This work was undertaken opportunistically and grew 
organically. The manual thus developed cumulatively and 
in an ad hoc way. Working from a structured protocol 
would have added greater methodological transparency 
and perhaps also potential for replication of the develop -
ment process. Finally, researchers working from different 
perspectives, with different experiences of NPT, using 
primary empirical studies rather than theory papers, or 
working from a prescheduled protocol, might have pro -
duced a different coding manual.
Conclusion
This paper describes the procedures by which the NPT 
coding manual for qualitative research was produced. It 
also presents the manual ready for use. But more than 
this, the process of producing the coding manual has also 
led to the simplification and consolidation of the theory 
by bringing together empirically grounded constructs 
derived from multiple iterations of theoretical develop -
ment over two decades.Fig. 1 Linking NPT to realist evaluation: implementation contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes

Coding manuals are useful tools to support analysis in 
qualitative research. They reduce cognitive load and at the 
same time render the assumptions underpinning qualita -
tive analysis transparent and easily shared amongst teams 
of researchers. The coding manual makes the application 
of NPT simpler for the user. This adds value to qualita -
tive research on the adoption, implementation, and sus -
tainment of innovations by providing a stable, workable, 
set of constructs that sit comfortably alongside the well-
established model of realist evaluation [54]. It also forms 
a translational framework for researching and evaluating 
implementation processes and thus complements other 
resources for NPT researchers such as the NPT Toolkit 
and the NOMAD survey instrument [17, 19, 21, 22].
