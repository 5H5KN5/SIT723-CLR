Abstract
Background: In 2009, Damschroder et al. developed the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR),
which provides a comprehensive listing of constructs thought to influence implementation. This systematic review
assesses the extent to which the CFIR ’s use in implementation research fulfills goals set forth by Damschroder et al. in
terms of breadth of use, depth of application, and contribution to implementation research.
Methods: We searched Scopus and Web of Science for publications that cited the original CFIR publication by
Damschroder et al. (Implement Sci 4:50, 2009) and downloaded each un ique result for review. After applying exclusion
criteria, the final articles were empirical studies published in peer-review journals that us ed the CFIR in a meaningful way
(i.e., used the CFIR to guide data collec tion, measurement, coding, analysis, and/or reporting). A framework analysis
approach was used to guide ab straction and synthesis of the included articles.
Results: T w e n t y - s i xo f4 2 9u n i q u ea r t i c l e s( 6% )m e ti n c l u s i o nc r i teria. We found great breadth in CFIR application; the
CFIR was applied across a wide variety of study objectives, se ttings, and units of analysis. There was also variation in the
method of included studies (mixed methods ( n= 13); qualitative ( n=1 0 ) ;q u a n t i t a t i v e( n= 3)). Depth of CFIR application
revealed some areas for improvement. Few studies ( n= 3) reported justification for selection of CFIR constructs used; the
majority of studies ( n= 14) used the CFIR to guide data analysis only; and few studies investigated any outcomes ( n=1 1 ) .
Finally, reflections on the contribution of the CFIR to implementation research were scarce.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the CFIR has been used acro ss a wide range of studies, though more in-depth use
of the CFIR may help advance implementation science. To harness its potential, researchers should consider how to most
meaningfully use the CFIR. Specific recommendations for applying the CFIR include explicitly justifying selection of CFIR
constructs; integrating the CFIR throughout the research pr ocess (in study design, data collection, and analysis); and
appropriately using the CFIR given the phase of impl ementation of the research (e.g., if the research is
post-implementation, using the CFIR to link de terminants of implementation to outcomes).

Background
A top priority for implementat ion research is to understand
why an innovation is successfully implemented in one set-
ting, but not in another. Without a theoretical framework
to guide data collection, analys is, and interpretation, imple-
mentation researchers often id entify determinants of imple-
mentation that apply only to the specific contexts in which
their research was conducted. C onducting implementation
research without a theoretical framework also hinders a
foundational scientific goal of being able to generalize and
build on findings across studies and contexts. Conse-
quently, researchers and policymakers have called for
greater use of theory in implementation research [1]. Many
implementation theoretical frameworks describe similar or
overlapping constructs, each wi th slightly different termin-
ologies and definitions [2]. Thus, in 2009, Damschroder
et al. undertook a review of the implementation science
literature with the aim of inte grating previously published
theories into a single, consolidated framework to guide
implementation research [3]. The result of this literature
review was the Consolidated Framework for Implementa-
tion Research (CFIR).
The CFIR is a meta-theoretical framework that provides
a repository of standardized implementation-related con-
structs that can be applied across the spectrum of imple-
mentation research [3]. The CF IR comprises 39 constructs
organized across five major domains, all of which interact
to influence implementation and implementation effective-
ness [3]. Additional file 1 includes a description of CFIR
constructs within each domain.
The CFIR provides a common language by which deter-
minants of implementation can be articulated, as well as a
comprehensive, standardized list of constructs to serve
as a guide for researchers as they identify variables that
are most salient to implementation of a particular
innovation [4]. The CFIR can be used to develop data
collection approaches (e.g., interview guide, codebook)
and as a guide for analyzing, interpreting, and/or reporting
implementation-related findings. The CFIR can be applied
at any phases of implementation (i.e., pre-, during, or
post-implementation), and researchers can also use the
CFIR ’s constructs as building blocks for developing test-
able hypothetical models that focus on specific constructs
and their interrelationships. At the macro level, the CFIR
provides a standardized structure for building on findings
across studies [3].
Although use of the CFIR as a theoretical framework
appears to be on the rise since its publication in 2009, no
formal reviews have been conducted to investigate its
impact on implementation research. Thus, our specific re-
search objectives for this sys tematic review are as follows:
/C15Objective 1: determine types of studies that use the
CFIR./C15Objective 2: determine how the CFIR has been
applied, including depth of application.
/C15Objective 3: determine the contribution of the CFIR
to implementation research.
The objectives of this systematic review are based on a
review of Damschroder et al. ’s seminal publication [3],
which specified criteria for using the CFIR and goals for the
CFIR over time. Findings from this systematic review can
be used as a reference for implementation researchers as
they integrate the CFIR into their work. To this end, we
conclude this systematic review by making recom-
mendations to promote the CFIR ’s use as intended by
Damschroder et al.
Methods
Search strategy
We employed a citation search strategy to identify pub-
lished peer-reviewed articles that describe use of the
CFIR to guide their research. The cited article used for
our search was the original 2009 CFIR publication by
Damschroder et al. [3]. We searched two citation index
databases, Web of Science and Scopus, from August
2009 through January 2015. These databases were se-
lected because they offer the most comprehensive data-
bases of articles that can be tracked using citations, and
they allow for cited reference searching. Although other
databases, such as Google Scholar, may provide wider
coverage of certain types of publications (international,
non-English journals, conference proceedings) [5], those
publications were excluded from our review. In addition,
literature shows that Web of Science and Scopus yield
more consistent and accurate results than other databases
that may provide wider coverage (e.g., Google Scholar) [6].
In Scopus, the search string was REF (fostering implemen-
tation of health services res earch findings into practice: a
consolidated framework for advancing implementation
science). In Web of Science, the search strategy was TITLE:
(fostering implementation of health services research find-
ings into practice: a consolidated framework for advancing
implementation science), and the “times cited ”link pro-
vided a full list of citations of the original CFIR paper. Full
texts of all resulting articles were downloaded for review.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
English language research that used the CFIR in a meaning-
ful way (i.e., use of CFIR to guide data collection, measure-
ment, coding, analysis, and/o rr e p o r t i n g )i na ne m p i r i c a l
study and were published in a peer-reviewed journal were
included. Excluded were protocols, editorials, and articles
that cited the CFIR, but neither reported applying nor plan-
ning to apply the CFIR (e.g., cited the CFIR in the introduc-
tion to acknowledge the complexity of implementation
context). This review focused on empirical studies, so weKirk et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:72 Page 2 of 13
excluded syntheses in which the CFIR was one of a list of
frameworks, theories, or models.
Study selection process
Article selection was performed by two authors (CK,
AK). One author (CK) performed a full text analysis of
all articles, searching for evidence of meaningful use of
the CFIR by examining the methods and results sections.
There was no initial screening based on titles or ab-
stracts because this review is based on citations of the
CFIR, and the CFIR was not always mentioned in those
sections. Before the primary reviewer (CK) conducted
the full text review of all articles, the research team went
through a preliminary review process to refine inclusion
and exclusion criteria. During this preliminary review
process, a second author (AK) reviewed of a sub-sample
of articles (71 articles, or 17 % of 429 unique papers
resulting from our search) to establish refined inclusion
and exclusion criteria, and ensure criteria were applied
consistently. During this preliminary phase, if the re-
viewers disagreed or were uncertain about the inclusion
of any article, the article was discussed with the senior
authors (LD, SB). After the preliminary review phase,
CK completed a full-text review of all articles. During
this phase, the majority of articles were excluded be-
cause they did not meet the criteria for using the CFIR
in a meaningful way. All articles marked for inclusion
were also assessed by a second reviewer (AK). The two
reviewers achieved 80 % agreement on their determin-
ation of whether to include articles in the final sample.
When there was disagreement, both reviewers discussed
until consensus was reached.
Data extraction and analysis
We used a framework analysis approach to guide abstrac-
tion and synthesis of the included articles [7]. The study
team developed a standardized data abstraction tool inMicrosoft Excel where content was arrayed in a matrix
format consisting of rows (art icles), columns (codes), and
cells (summarized data) [8]. Abstraction was accomplished
in five phases. First, in the familiarization phase, we
reviewed a subset of the included articles to familiarize
team members with the literature base. Second, we identi-
fied a thematic framework based on our specific research
objectives, which served as the codes used to identify and
extract passages from the artic les. These codes comprised
the columns in our abstraction matrix. Final codes by study
objective are presented in Table 1.
In the third and fourth phases, indexing and charting,
four authors (CK, AK, NY, and BA) extracted text selec-
tions from included articles into our abstraction matrix.
Two individuals independently indexed and charted each
article, comparing results; discrepancies were discussed
until consensus was reached. In the fifth and final phase,
mapping and interpretation, passages from the abstraction
matrix were analyzed by AK, SB, and LD to develop over-
arching themes for each code. Themes were discussed
among all co-authors until consensus was reached.
The quality and depth of application of the CFIR was
assessed by (1) the inclusion criteria of our systematic
review (i.e., the proportion of articles that were included
because they used the CFIR in a meaningful way) and (2)
research objective 2, which focuses on the depth of CFIR
application. This assessment was intended to evaluate qual-
ity of CFIR application and not the quality of any other as-
pects of the studies described in the included articles.
Results
Our searches yielded 716 retrievals; the search in Scopus
yielded 398 retrievals and Web of Science yielded 318.
Of those 716, 287 were duplicate retrievals and were
removed, leaving 429 unique articles that cited the 2009
CFIR paper. Of the 429 unique articles, we excluded a
total of 403 articles. Three hundred fifty-six articles were

excluded because they were non-meaningful uses of the
CFIR (e.g., use of the CFIR as background or plans for
future research in the discussion), and 47 were excluded
because they were syntheses, study protocols, etc.; 26
articles (6 % of 429) were included in the final sample.
See Fig. 1. All 26 included articles were reviewed to meet
our three research objectives.
Objective 1: types of studies that have used the CFIR
Each study was characterized with respect to research ob-
jective, setting, unit of analysis, phase of implementation,
and study design and methods (see Table 2).
Research objective
All but one study [9] investigated facets of implementation
of innovations that had already been developed and tested
for feasibility or effectiveness. The general research object-
ive of most (73.1 %) studies was to gain an in-depth under-
standing of practitioners ’experiences (e.g. , implementation
processes, barriers and facilitators to implementation) in
innovation implementation. Stu dies investigated implemen-
tation of a wide variety of innovations (e.g., healthcare
delivery and process re-design, quality improvement, healthpromotion, and disease management), spanning a wide var-
iety of health-related topics (e .g., mental health, obesity,
and blood pressure).
Setting and unit of analysis
Healthcare systems were the most common settings for
implementation ( n= 20). The unit of analysis was most
often the organization in wh ich implementation occurred
(n= 12) or the providers involved in implementation ( n=
11); other units of analysis included programs ( n=2 ) ,
departments ( n=2 ) ,a n dp a t i e n t( n=2 ) .
Phase of implementation
The majority of studies ( n= 15) focused their data collec-
tion and evaluations in the p ost-implementation phase,
though some studies did occur during ( n=8 ) o r p r e -
implementation ( n= 2). In the seminal CFIR publication,
Damschroder et al. outlined ways in which the CFIR could
be used across phases of imp lementation [3]. For pre-
implementation research, the CFIR provides a list of “expli-
citly defined constructs ”to conduct capacity and needs
assessments to identify potential determinants (barriers and
facilitators) to implementation [3]. During implementation,

CFIR constructs can provide a roadmap to monitor imple-
mentation progress. In post-i mplementation, the CFIR can
be used to “guide exploration ”to determine what factors
influenced outcomes such as im plementation effectiveness
and intervention effectiveness [3]. In general, we found that
phase of implementation mapped onto Damschroder
et al. ’s intended use of the CFIR, though there were some
exceptions, especially among post-implementation studies.
For example, studies that occurred during the pre-
implementation phase used the CFIR to investigate poten-
tial barriers to implementation prior to the roll-out of the
innovation. A case in point, Robins et al. used the CFIR to
guide interviews of providers about potential barriers to
implementing a home blood pressure monitoring program
in the pre-implementation phase [10]. Findings revealed
t h a tt h e r ew a saf l a wi nak e yc o m p o n e n to ft h ep r o g r a m ;
specifically, many clinics l acked an in-house pharmacist
necessary for the program (coded to Available Resources
within the Inner Setting). Sub sequently, the investigators
explored options for re-des igning the program to accom-
modate clinics without an in-house pharmacist.
Some studies, however, did not apply the CFIR in a man-
ner completely consistent w ith the guidance set forth by
Damschroder et al. [3]. In particular, studies that occurred
post-implementation most commonly used the CFIR to
investigate facilitators/barr iers to implementation among
participants who had already adopted and implemented an
innovation (e.g., [11]), thus identifying determinants of
implementation post hoc. This application of the CFIR is
more aligned with Damschroder et al. ’s pre-implementation
guidance and does not incorporate a key component of
Damschroder et al. ’s suggestion for applying the CFIR to
post-implementation research —which is to link determi-
nants of implementation to outcomes (e.g., implementation
or innovation effectiveness).
Study design and methods
The majority of studies employed either a mixed methods
(n= 13) or qualitative ( n= 10) design. Only three studies
were purely quantitative. Common qualitative methods
included key informant interviews and focus groups with
program managers or participants. Studies using quantita-
tive methods commonly employed surveys and adminis-
trative data collection methods. Quantitative measures of
CFIR constructs were developed using a variety of outside
sources because no widely accepted quantitative measures
for CFIR constructs currently exist. Most studies en-
gaged in primary data collec tion either through inter-
views or surveys. Two studies, however, conducted
secondary analysis of existing qualitative data sources
including meeting minutes, memos, and quarterly
reports generated during the implementation of the
innovation under investigation [12, 13].Objective 2: depth of CFIR application
As an initial overall indicator of the depth of CFIR appli-
cation, it is interesting to note that of the initial 429
unique articles that cited the original CFIR publication,
356 (82.9 %) did not meet our definition for meaningful
use of the CFIR (i.e., they did not integrate the CFIR in
methods and reporting of findings). Among the 26 arti-
cles that did meet our inclusion criteria, we assessed the
depth of CFIR application according to the following cri-
teria: selection and use of CFIR domains and constructs,
application of the CFIR in the methods, and whether the
CFIR was being used to investigate outcomes.
Selection and use of CFIR domains and constructs
Figure 2 reports CFIR constructs used in studies, rank
ordered from highest to lowest use within each domain.
(For a listing of which constructs where used by which
studies, see Additional file 2.) Overall, there was wide
variation in use of CFIR domains and constructs. Some
of the included studies reported on domains only ( n= 9),
while others used all domains and all constructs ( n= 3).
Two studies [14, 15] made no explicit reference to use
of specific domains or constructs.
With respect to the selection of CFIR constructs,
Damschroder et al. offered guidance on how to best select,
operationalize, measure, and report findings of CFIR con-
structs. Damschroder et al. recommended that implemen-
tation researchers assess each CFIR construct for salience;
determine levels at which each construct should be de-
fined and measured (e.g., individual, team, clinic); and be
aware of time points at which each construct is measured
[3]. They also recommended that researchers report each
decision and rationale, along with findings for each
construct that is ultimately selected [3]. In our review, we
found that authors of only three articles reported justifica-
tion for their selection of the set of CFIR domains/con-
structs used [9, 16, 17]. Within these three articles, there
were two main strategies used to select relevant CFIR
constructs. Two of the three articles selected CFIR con-
structs based on their own prior knowledge about which
CFIR domains/constructs would be most relevant to their
research question [16, 17]. The remaining article [9] se-
lected constructs by first piloting an interview guide that
included questions for all CFIR domains. Based on pilot
interviews, the authors identified which constructs were
deemed most relevant by providers involved in implemen-
tation and included only those constructs in the final
version of the interview guide.
Application of the CFIR in the methods
Table 3 reports application of the CFIR (i.e., whether the
CFIR was used to guide data collection, analysis, or both)
by study design (mixed methods, quantitative, or qualita-
tive). The majority of included studies ( n= 14 (54 %)) usedKirk et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:72 Page 7 of 13
the CFIR to guide data analysis only. Three studies used
the CFIR to guide data collection only, and six studies
used the CFIR to guide both data collection and analysis.
The way the CFIR informed study methods depended on
study design. For qualitative studies, the CFIR was used to
guide data collection via development of semi-structuredinterview guides or focus group protocols. For qualitative
analysis, the CFIR was used to guide development of quali-
tative coding templates. In quantitative or mixed-method
studies, the CFIR was used in the data collection phase to
inform survey question development (e.g., [18, 19]). In
quantitative or mixed-method analysis, the CFIR was usedFig. 2 Count of CFIR constructs used in studies. Note: This figure includes only studies which specified CFIR constructs used ( n=15). Nine studies
specified only domains that were used and no constructs. Two studies made no explicit reference to any CFIR domains or constructsKirk et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:72 Page 8 of 13
in a variety of ways. In mixed-method approaches (e.g., [9]),
the CFIR was used with both qualitative and quantitative
methods to ascertain complementary information about
implementation-related efforts. For example, Kalkan et al.
[9] used the CFIR qualitativel y to elicit information about
CFIR constructs which providers believed had any influence
on implementation; quantitative ranking of the most influ-
ential CFIR constructs allowed the researchers to ascertain
quantitative impact of various CFIR constructs. Quantita-
tive uses of the CFIR mostly focused on linking CFIR con-
structs to implementation or innovation outcomes. For
example, Damschroder and Lowery [20] used quantitative
ratings of CFIR constructs to distinguish between facilities
with high and low implementation effectiveness, and found
that 10 CFIR constructs stro ngly distinguished between
high and low implementation effectiveness.
Authors reported that using the CFIR to guide data
collection efforts had advantages over using the CFIR in
data analysis only. Authors that used the CFIR to inform
the development of their structured interview guides
stated that if they had not used the CFIR constructs as a
“checklist ”of variables for consideration, they would
have either missed factors to assess, or they would have
asked about irrelevant factors [9, 17]. Conversely, investiga-
tors reported that using the C F I Ro n l yt og u i d ed a t aa n a -
lysis was a disadvantage because they did not anticipate the
importance of unmeasured implementation factors.
Investigation of outcomes using the CFIR
T h em a j o r i t yo fa r t i c l e s( n= 15 (58 %)) did not investigate
outcomes and focused primarily on descriptive objectives
to identify barriers and facilitators of implementation.
Slightly less than half ( n= 11 (42 %)) of the included arti-
cles assessed implementation outcomes, which varied
widely. Some studies investigated implementation or
innovation effectiveness as the outcome of interest, while
other studies investigated process outcomes (e.g., exposure
to the innovation). Of the 11 studies that investigated out-
comes, six assessed associations between CFIR constructs
and relevant outcomes. Application of the CFIR toinvestigate outcomes included using CFIR constructs to
distinguish between high and low implementation effect-
iveness, using CFIR constructs as predictors of implemen-
tation effectiveness outcomes in regression models, and
using CFIR constructs as control variables in analysis. Kil-
bourne at al. [21] is an example of the latter application
(using CFIR constructs as controls), and is the most exten-
sive quantitative analytic approach included in our sample
(i.e., the only article that developed a predictive analytic
model). Kilbourne et al. used quantitative measures of 12
CFIR constructs (e.g., implementation climate, complexity,
peer pressure) that were distributed across all five domains
as covariates in analytic models to examine changes in im-
plementation outcomes. Quantitative measures of CFIR
constructs allowed the authors t oc o n t r o lf o ra d d i t i o n a lf a c -
tors beyond typical patient-level characteristics, such as
gender, race, and age.
Objective 3: contribution of the CFIR to implementation
research
For Objective 3, our goal was to d etermine the contribution
of the CFIR to implementatio n research, which we assessed
by considering three questions posed by Damschroder et al.
in their 2009 article introducing the CFIR [3]. These three
questions included (1) coherence of CFIR terminology, (2)
whether the CFIR promotes comparison across studies, and
(3) whether the CFIR stimulates new theoretical develop-
m e n t .O v e r a l l ,r e f l e c t i o n so nt h eC F I R ’s utility and contri-
butions within our sample were sparse. The following three
sections provide insights based on the articles included in
this review.
Is CFIR terminology and language coherent?
In general, authors offered few reflections on the coherence
of CFIR terminology and constructs. A few authors noted
that the constructs were gener ally easy to understand and
apply (e.g., [12, 20 –23]); others noted specific suggestions
for clarification and some gaps in the constructs. For
example, Damschroder and Lowery [20] reported some
challenges distinguishing be tween related constructs in
qualitative data coding, but noted that this was overcome
by using concrete examples from their own data. They
identified these construct pa irs, which included relative
priority versus patient needs and resources, and design
quality and packaging versus access to knowledge and
information. To further clarify the distinction between
these constructs, Damschrode r and Lowery added specific
examples to an online CFIR technical assistance interactive
wiki (www.cfirguide.org), whic h they (and other researchers
[24]) encourage implementati on researchers to use for add-
itional coding guidance and to promote sharing continued
refinements to these guides. Ilo tt and colleagues [12] identi-
fied several gaps in the CFIR and recommended more
development of a few constructs. Improvements in existingTable 3 Application of the CFIR by study design

constructs noted by these authors include identification of
stakeholders in the tension for change construct, as well as
a time point component for relative advantage, since these
perceptions may change over time. The primary gap identi-
fied by Ilott et al. was lack of consideration of scale-up,
spread, and sustainability. I lott et al. noted that the CFIR
process domain ends after reflecting and evaluating, which
they noted as “premature given the importance of longer
term change ”[12].
Does the CFIR promote comparison of results across
contexts and studies over time?
Few included articles ( n= 3) compared their findings to
other studies. However, the discussion section of several
articles noted that the standardized nature of the CFIR
would promote comparison across future research. Thus,
the potential is acknowledged, although few actually did
cross-comparisons.
Does the CFIR stimulate new theoretical development?
Only two articles mentioned how the CFIR promoted
theoretical development [17, 20]. One article mentioned
that further research was needed to develop measures,
to propose and test models that predict implementation,
and to assess the extent to which constructs can be used
to develop implementation strategies [20]; another art-
icle linked CFIR constructs to a “foundational strategy
for implementation ”[17].
Discussion
Overall, the CFIR has been applied across a wide range of
studies with a wide range of objectives, units of analysis,
design, and methods, suggesting that the CFIR is applicable
to a wide range of interventions, settings, and research de-
signs. Despite the CFIR ’s application to a wide range of
studies and settings, we found areas for improvement with
respect to the depth of the CFIR ’s application. These find-
ings are discussed in greater detail below.
The use and selection of CFIR constructs
Overall, we found wide variation in which CFIR con-
structs were used and evaluated, and little reporting of
methods or logic for selecting CFIR constructs or do-
mains. This gap limits the contribution of the CFIR to
implementation science, and is not in alignment with
guidance published by Damschroder et al., which recom-
mends that researchers report each decision and rationale
for selection, measurement, and reporting of CFIR con-
structs. A justification of selection of CFIR constructs
would help ensure consistency of implementation studies
(i.e., that the most salient implementation-related factors
were investigated). In addition, we found several instances
where authors were not explicit about which constructs
were selected (i.e., no reporting of final constructs orreporting was at the domain-level only). This lack of spe-
cificity limits opportunities to compare research over time
and across contexts.
How the CFIR was used
The majority of studies (53.8 %) used the CFIR only to
guide data analysis. Some auth ors noted this as a limitation
because they did not anticipate the importance of certain
unmeasured implementation factors. As the use of the
CFIR continues to increase, and as with use of any theory,
integrating the CFIR into res earch question development
and data collection efforts early-on will strengthen research
and applicability of findings.
Phase of implementation
Most studies applied the CFIR during- or post-
implementation to identify barriers and facilitators to im-
plementation of an innovation. Only two studies (7.69 %)
used the CFIR prior to innovation implementation to help
inform future implementation efforts. This is a potential
missed opportunity since studies that did use the CFIR
prior to implementation (e.g., [10]) were able to identify
potential barriers to implementation, refine their imple-
mentation strategy, and adapt the innovation before imple-
mentation began. The use of the CFIR to prospectively
investigate implementation issues before a program is
rolled out on a large scale can allow for critical program
re-design, increasing the likelihood of successful program
dissemination and implementation. The use of the CFIR
during- or post-implementation may have similar benefits,
but only if researchers use information about barriers and
facilitators to inform adaptations of the innovation, imple-
mentation, scale-up, or sustainment. In general, our review
found little evidence of post-implementation findings being
applied to help inform implementation, scale-up, or sus-
tainment. Additionally, Damschroder et al. identified that
the meaningful use of the CFIR in post-implementation
research would include linking CFIR constructs (determi-
nants of implementation) to outcomes (implementation or
innovation effectiveness); results revealed that only about
half of the post-implementation studies reported investigat-
ing the association of CFIR constructs with outcomes.
Additional information on investigation of outcomes is
reported below.
Investigation of outcomes using CFIR constructs
Investigation of outcomes is critical for the field of imple-
mentation science overall because optimal implementation
outcomes are a necessary condition for innovation effect-
iveness [25, 26]. Additionally, the study and measurement
of implementation outcomes is vital since it allows the
field to “advance the understanding of implementation
processes, enable studies of comparative effectiveness of
implementation strategies, and enhance efficiency inKirk et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:72 Page 10 of 13
implementation research ”[25]. Fewer than half of the in-
cluded studies in our review assessed outcomes and even
fewer ( n= 6) linked CFIR constructs to outcomes. This is a
gap in the implementation literature in and of itself and not
necessarily constrained to those that reported use of the
CFIR. Even among articles that did investigate outcomes,
there is room for improvement in outcome metrics since
some were just metrics of exposure to an innovation, not
meaningful measures of implem entation effectiveness, such
as those conceptualized by P roctor et al. [25]. In studies
that did relate CFIR constructs to outcomes, there was vari-
ation in how CFIR constructs were used, and there was a
trend of more studies investigating outcomes later in our
review timeframe (2013 –2014). Some studies used CFIR
constructs as direct pred ictors of implementation
effectiveness while others used CFIR constructs as control
variables in investigating implementation outcomes. Unfor-
tunately, a lack of specificat ion of use of CFIR constructs
did not allow us to synthesize f indings across studies to see
if there were trends in which CFIR constructs were found
to influence outcomes, and under what conditions, reveal-
ing another gap in the research . Greater investigation of
meaningful implementation ou tcomes, clearer linkage ofCFIR constructs with outcomes, and clearer specification of
which CFIR constructs were u sed to investigate outcomes
would allow for more robust comparisons across studies.
This would contribute to the fi eld of implementation sci-
ence by enabling structured investigation of which con-
structs influence outcomes and under what conditions.
Contribution of the CFIR to implementation science
In the 6 years since the CFIR was published, its use in
empirical studies has steadily increased and there is mod-
est progress towards achieving the goals set forth by
Damschroder et al. Terminology and language of the
CFIR ’s constructs appear to be coherent; the few sugges-
tions for improvements to the CFIR did not point to
significant changes in the framework. There was much
less evidence of progress for the remaining two goal-
s—promoting comparison of results across contexts and
studies over time and advancing theory —but limited pro-
gress may be more a function of the short amount of time
since the initial publication of the CFIR. In the 6 years
since its publication, few studies have used the CFIR in a
meaningful way ( n= 26); however, this is understandable,
given the number of years needed to conceive, obtainTable 4 Recommendations for applying the CIFR in implementation research
Recommendation Rationale Notes/explanation
Consider how to most meaningfully
use the CFIR across different phases
of implementation (pre-, during, or
post-implementation).Explicit use and reporting of CFIR constructs
at various phases of implementation would
allow comparisons across phases.Meaningful pre-implementation assessment would help to
identify barriers to address and facilitators to leverage,
which in turn, would inform choice of strategies that will
increase likelihood of implem entation success. In addition,
this information can be used to adapt the intervention to
fit local context.
Meaningful during or post-implementation studies
would continue identification of barriers and facilitators
to implementation to:
▪Inform scale-up efforts
▪Inform implementation of an innovation in other
settings/contexts
▪Associate CFIR constructs with implementation
outcomes (if using mixed-methods or quantitative
studies)
Report how CFIR constructs were
selected for assessment.Help to ensure rigor of implementation studies
(i.e., that the most salient implementation-related
factors were investigated) and promotes the ability
to compare research over time and across contexts.Researchers using the CFIR should clearly report: (1)
justification/rationale for selecting CFIR constructs and
(2) the CFIR constructs used in the research study.
Increase use of CFIR to investigate
outcomes.Investigation of outcomes allows for more robust
comparisons across studies to identify which
constructs influence outcomes and under what
conditions.Researchers should include measurement of
implementation outcomes to assess association of CFIR
constructs with implementation outcomes.
Within the context of investigating outcomes,
researchers should: (1) include implementation
outcome measures (such as those mentioned by
Proctor et al. [ 25]), (2) provide clearer linkage of CFIR
constructs with outcomes, and (3) provide clearer
specification of which CFIR constructs were used to
investigate outcomes.
Integrate the CFIR more holistically
into the research process.Integrating the CFIR into research question
development and data collection efforts early-on will
strengthen research and applicability of findings.The CFIR should be used throughout the research
process. Researchers can use the CFIR Technical
Assistance wiki ( www.cfirguide.org ) to develop
research questions, interview and coding guides, as
well as to refine CFIR constructs, definitions, and
theoretical developments.Kirk et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:72 Page 11 of 13
funding for, execute, and then publish research studies
and their findings. Damschroder et al. ’s goals were voiced
earlier by developers of the PARIHS framework [27]. A
review of application of the PARIHS framework approxi-
mately 10 years after its initial publication identified 18
articles describing empirical studies [28]. This review
identified minimal prospective use of PARIHS in pub-
lished articles and insufficient descriptions of how the
framework was used to guide studies. The limitations
identified in this review of the CFIR and of PARIHS are
not unusual and reflect a general lack of integration of
theory/frameworks into empirical studies [29, 30]. Better
integration of the CFIR (or other theoretical framework)
into empirical studies would help to address gaps in use of
theory and advance implementation science [4, 31, 32].
Additionally, structured guidance on how to comprehen-
sively apply theory in implementation research may help
achieve consistency and rigor in the application of theory
or frameworks when they are used by implementation
researchers.
To assist researchers in their application of the CFIR, we
have developed a list of recommendations (see Table 4).
These include (1) consider how to most meaningfully use
the CFIR across different phases of implementation, (2)
report how CFIR constructs were selected and which
constructs were used, (3) assess the association of CFIR
constructs with outcomes, and (4) integrate the CFIR
throughout the entire research process (e.g., to develop
research questions, data collection materials, and to refine
CFIR constructs and promote theoretical development).
An online CFIR technical assistance website (www.cfirgui
de.org) is available to guide application of the CFIR in
implementations and evaluations.
Conclusions
In the 6 years since its publication, 26 of 429 published
articles were identified as having used the CFIR in a mean-
ingful way in a study. These articles collectively indicate
that the CFIR has been used across a wide range of studies
with a wide range of objectives, units of analysis, design,
methods, and implementations of an array of innovations
in an array of settings. However, more in-depth and pro-
spective use of the CFIR (or other framework) may help
to advance implementation science.
