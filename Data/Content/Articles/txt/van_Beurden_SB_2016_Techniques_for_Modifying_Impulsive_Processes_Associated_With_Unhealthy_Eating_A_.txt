van Beurden, S.B., Greaves, C.J., Smith, J.R., & Abraham, C.  
The main paper systematically reviews the research evidence on techniques for modifying 
impulsive processes in relation to unhealthy eating. This supplement contains further de tailed 
information illustrating our searching and screening methods (Tables S1 &  S2), tables 
providing  included  study characteristics  and definitions of study designs and non -standard 
outcomes  (S3-5) as well as detailed evidence data extracted from  included studies  (S6-8), the 
synthesis of the strength of evidence in relation to weigh t loss, food consumption, and 
cravings ( S9) and the narrative synthesis for the techniques with unclear mechanisms . Press

Table S4 provides the definitions of study designs as well as non -standard outcomes assessed  by the included studies and referred to in the main 
manuscript.  
Table S4: Definitions of study designs and non -standard outcomes  
Study d esigns  Definition  
Randomized Controlled Trial  A study in which a number of similar people are randomly assigned to 2 (or more) groups to test a specific treatment. With on e group 
receiving the experimental treatment and the comparison group (or control group) receiving an alternative treatment or no t reatment at 
all.  
Non-randomized Controlled Trial  A study in which a number of similar people are allocated (without the use of randomization) to 2 (or more) groups to test a specific 
treatment. With one group receiving the experimental treatment and the comparison group (or control group) receiving an alternative 
treatment or no treatment at all.  
Factorial Experiment  A study with two (or more) factors (independent variables). These are used in all possible treatment combinations. Each separ ate 
condition consists of a different combination of factors.  
Crossover Trial  A study in which participants receive all possible treatments. Randomisation may be used to determine the order in which the patient 
receives each treatment. In this type of design participants serve as their own control.  
Uncontrolled study  A study witho ut a comparison or control group. All participants are in the same condition.  
Non-obvious outcomes definitions  
Hypothetical food choice  Participants are asked to choose which food they would like to have but are not actually given the food.  
Attention Processing  The attention paid to stimuli consisting of attentional disengagement from a previously attended stimulus: and attentional en gagement 
with a new stimulus.  
Attentional Bias  Tendency to notice quicker, and pay more attention to, some stimuli in the environment than others.  
Automatic evaluations  People continuously evaluate aspects of their environment in an automatic fashion. These evaluations can be positive or negat ive and are 
able to trigger behavioral  responses away or toward the environment.  
Goal activation  Refers to the automatic activation of non -conscious goals that guide attention, behaviour, and cognition without an individual’s 
awareness.  
Goal importance and intentions  Goal intentions specify what one wants to achieve.  
Goal importance is the perceived importance of achieving that particular goal.

Study d esigns  Definition  
Approach bias  A behavioral tendency to be faster at approaching rather than avoiding particular cues or stimuli.   
(Delay) Discounting patterns  Depreciation of the value of a reward related to the time that it takes to be released. High rates of delay discounting refer  to a preference 
to select a smaller more immediate reward over a larger future reward  
Susceptibility  to food  Psychological influence of the food environment.  
Subsequent self -control (in other self -
control task)  Self-control as measured after a previous task has required the person to exert self -control.

There was a Subsequent eating opportunity x

When controlling for restraint, BMI, and disinhibition 
there was a significant cue type x cue validity x group 
interaction (F(1,52)=3.19, p=.05). In the NAFT 
condition, participants reacted more quickly to the 
invalid food trials compared to the valid food trials (M 
Diff=20ms, SMD= -.44, p=.01) and the valid jewel 
trials (M Diff=13ms, SDM= -.32, p=.0003), but no 
different from the invalid jewel trials (p=.07). The 
same pattern was found for the AFT conditio n, but here 
reactions were quicker than to invalid jewel trials as 
well (p=.05). No difference in reaction times between 
trial types was found in the control condition.  
 
These findings indicate that attention may have been 
drawn away from the food cues after exposure to non

comparison to the control condition.  Student sample

Evidence Synthesis  
Table S9 illustrates the overall evidence synthesis taking into account quality of the evidence as defined by the following c riteria as referred to in the 
main pap er: 
 
Promising findings  (or ‘evidence against’ if evidence is negative) = at least one larger randomized study (>60 per group), OR  3 or more small ( but 
not very small) randomized studies. Plus, the majority (80%) of the studies showing significant differences in the same direc tion.  
Mixed evidence  =  at least one larger randomized study (>60 per group), OR 3 or more small (but not very small) randomized studies showing 
evidence in either direction. However, no majority (80%) in one direction.  
Insufficient evidence =  all small ( less than 3) or very small studies OR no randomized studies.

behavioral schemas  
Insufficient evidence   
(One very small RCT and 1 very small non -randomised controlled trial for, one small 
factorial experiment against ). 
Priming with love, family, or health focus cues  may be able to reduce food consumption 
immediately post treatment for dieters and restrained eaters. There was no investigation of 
effects on cravings or weight.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to generate definite conclusions and to assess the longer -term effectiveness of 
priming techniques on food consumption, weight loss, and craving.  
1.2 Cue-exposure. Exposure to food cues to reduce future consumption.   
Insufficient evidence   
One very small RCT, one very small non -randomized crossover trial, two small 
randomised factorial experiments and one non -randomised factorial experiment suggested 
that exposure to unhealthy food cues doe s not reduce food consumption post exposure and 
may increase it.  There was insufficient evidence of effects on cravings to draw any conclusions and 
no evidence of effects on weight. Cue exposure does not seem a promising approach 
for further research.

Evidence  Future research  
Mixed evidence   
Inhibition training (e.g. go/no -go tasks) may be effective in reducing food consumption 
post treatment (one small RCT and two small randomized factorial experiments for; two 
very small RCTs and one very small non -randomized crossover trial against). All studies 
were limited to student samples, preventing any clear conclusions from being drawn. Sub -
group analyses suggested that effects may be cons trained to people with relatively low 
inhibitory control, chronic dieters and people with high appetite. There were no 
investigations of the effects on weight or cravings.  More evidence from adequately powered, community based RCTs on the short - and 
longer -term effectiveness on food consumption of inhibition training is needed, as 
well as evidence of the effects on weight and craving.  
1.3 Physical Activity. Undertaking active tasks such as exercise or walking.  
Insufficient evidence   
One very small random ized crossover trial and one very small randomized factorial 
experiment that physical activity may reduce food consumption post activity.  
Promising evidence  
Two randomized crossover trials with a priori power calculations and two very small 
randomized crossover trials suggest that physical activity may reduce cravings for up to 
10 minutes following the activity.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in c ommunity based samples is 
needed to generate definite conclusions and to assess the longer -term effectiveness of 
physical activity targeting impulsive behaviors on food consumption and cravings.  
1.4 Attentional Bias Training. Modifying impulses by changi ng existing attentional biases towards environmental stimuli such as highly palatable, energy dense foods.  
Insufficient evidence   
One small RCT (for) and one very small (against) RCT provide insufficient evidence to 
suggest that attentional bias training may reduce food consumption immediately post 
training. There was no evidence of effects on cravings. There was no investigation of 
effects on weight.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to generate definite conc lusions and to assess the longer -term effectiveness of 
attentional bias training on food consumption, weight loss and cravings.  
1.5 Approach/Avoidance training. Following the automatic capturing of attention (as above), reward stimuli trigger a motivational response that directs behavi or toward target 
acquisition and consumption (an ‘approach’ tendency). Approach/Avoidance training aims to modify the implicit asso ciation to avoid (as opposed to approach), thereby reducing 
craving and consumption.  
Insufficient evidence  
One small RCT suggests that cravings associated with chocolate may be reduced post 
treatment for people receiving ‘avoid’ training to modify approa ch-avoidance tendencies. 
There was no investigation of effects on food consumption or weight.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to generate definite conclusions and to assess the longer -term effectiveness of 
Implicit Association Modification on food consumption and weight loss.

Evidence  Future research  
2.1 Mindfulness -based strategies.  Aim to raise awareness of the present moment by purposefully paying attention, without judgment, to the current experience that is unfolding, 
and observing its path without acting.  
Mixed evidence   
Sub-group analyses from one RCT and one uncontrolled study as well as within -group 
data from three RCTs suggested that acceptance -based mindfulness techniques, when 
delivered by expert practitioners might produce weight loss at up to 6 -months follow -up. 
NB: In categorising this evidence we chose to ignore comparisons between mindfulness 
and other active treatments (as comparison with a non -active control group is needed to 
establish effectiveness).  
Mixed evidence   
Distraction -based mindfulness techniques m ight reduce food consumption at up to 7 -days 
follow -up (two small and two very small RCTs for, one small and one very small RCT 
with active control groups against ) and cravings post treatment (one small RCT and two 
very small RCTs for, 6 against  (3 with ac tive control groups) of which two small one very 
small RCTs and three very small non -randomized controlled trials).  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs with non -active control conditions on 
the short - and longer -term effectiveness of mindfulness st rategies on weight, food 
consumption, and cravings, is needed, as well as evidence on the relative 
effectiveness of acceptance -based versus distraction -based mindfulness strategies.  
2.2 Visuospatial Loading. Use of tasks that occupy the sensory modalities  associated with craving (i.e., sight or smell) and reduce the resources available.   
Insufficient evidence   
One very small RCT suggests that visuospatial load may reduce food consumption post 
treatment, but another very small RCT showed no differences in  consumption between 
groups. There was no evidence of effects on weight.  
Promising evidence   
Six RCTs (four small and two very small), one factorial experiment, eight non -
randomized crossover studies (seven small and one very small) and one very small non -
randomized controlled trial all show that visuospatial loading or olfactory interference 
may reduce cravings for unhealthy foods immediately post treatment, and possibly for up 
to 3-months follow -up (one small RCT).   More evidence from larger, statistically powered RCTs is needed to draw any 
definitive conclusions about the effects on food consumption and to investigate 
longer -term effectiveness as well as evidence of the effects on weight.  
2.3 Implementation Intenti ons (if-then plans). Involves identification of a cue that will be encountered in daily activities and consciously resolving to take a particular action 
when it is encountered.  
Suppl File for Techniques for Modifying Impulsive Processes  82 
Table S9  
Evidence  Future research  
Promising evidence   
One small RCT and two small randomized factorial experiments and sub -group analyses 
in a larger RCT shows that forming impulse related implementation intentions (if -then 
planning) is effective in reducing food consumption post treatment and for up to one -week 
follow -up. There was no investigation of the effects on weight or cravings.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to replicate these findings and assess the longer -term effectiveness of impulse 
related if -then planning on food consumption, as well as evidence of effects on 
weight and cravings.  
2.4 Cognitive Loading.  Use of tasks that occupy working memory.  
Insufficient evidence    
One small non -randomized controlled trial suggests that cognitive loading may reduce 
cravings post treatment. Sub -group analyses in another small non -randomized controlled 
trial suggest that effects on food consumption may be limited to people who are more 
susceptible to food cues. There was no investigation of the effects on weight . More evidence from larger, statistically powered RCTs is needed to draw any 
definitive conclusions and to investigate longer -term effectiveness on food 
consumption, craving and weight.  
2.5 Thought Suppression. Actively avoiding thinking about something  to prevent engaging in associated undesirable behaviors  
Insufficient evidence  
One very small RCT and two small non -randomized controlled trials (and an additional 
very small RCT using thought suppression as a comparison group in the evaluation of  
mindf ulness -based strategies) suggest that thought suppression significantly increases 
food consumption and cravings post treatment. There was no investigation of the effects 
on weight.  
 Thought suppression does not seem a promising approach for further researc h. 
2.6 Cognitive Restructuring . A form of cognitive stimulus control which involves altering the meaning of a situation or object so that the response to it is changed.  
Insufficient evidence    
Due to a lack of studies comparing cognitive restructuring with control groups (the two, 
small and very small, RCTs in this field only used active treatments for comparison), no 
conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of these techniques in weight redu ction. 
However, within -group data from three RCTs suggested that cognitive restructuring might 
produce weight loss at up to 6 -months follow -up.   
Insufficient evidence  
One non -randomized crossover trial suggested that cognitive restructuring may reduce 
food cravings post treatment.  More evidence from RCTs with non -active control conditions on the short and 
longer -term effectiveness of cognitive restructuring on food consumption and 
cravings is needed, as well as evidence of the effects on weight.  
2.7 Emot ional Freedom Technique.  An acupuncture, meridian -based intervention employing stimulation of acupressure points through a tapping motion whilst keeping the mind 
focused on the negative emotion.

Evidence  Future research  
Insufficient evidence    
One small RCT found no effect of EFT  on weight loss post treatment or at 6 -months 
follow -up. However, EFT significantly reduced cravings post treatment. There was no 
investigation of the effects on food consumption.  
 More evidence from adequately powered adequately powered RCTs on the short and 
longer -term effectiveness of EFT on weight loss and cravings, as well as food 
consumption is needed, although it seems unlikely that this is a promising approach 
for further research.  
2.8 “I don’t” refusal framing. Use of self -talk to increase the sal ience of temptation resistance schemas.  
Insufficient evidence   
In one, small non -randomized controlled trial that using "I don't" refusal framing reduces 
unhealthy snack choice post treatment. There was no investigation on weight or cravings.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to replicate these findings and assess the longer -term effectiveness of "I 
don't" refusal framing.  
2.9 Autonomous Learning Conditions. Facilitating the setting of goals reflecting one’s own values (rather than external rewards, approval, or punishments).  
Insufficient evidence   
One very small student sample RCT suggests that autonomous learning conditions reduces 
food consumption and improves performance on a self -control task (e -hunt) compared 
with controlled learning at post treatment. There was no investigation of the effects on 
weight or cravings.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to replicate these findings and assess the longer -term effectiveness of 
autonomous learning conditions on food consumption, as well as evidence of the 
effects on weight and craving.  
Unclear Mechanisms (2 Techniques)  
3.1 Manipulating Regulatory Fit.  Engaging in goal pursuit strategies that correspond (vs conflict) with the orientation of one’s self -regulation focus.  
Insufficient evidence  
Two RCTs (one small and one very small) suggest that manipulation of regulatory fit may 
reduce unhealthy food consumption post treatment. There was no investigation of effects 
on cravings or weight.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to generate definite conclusions and to assess the longer -term effectiveness of 
manipulation of regulatory fit on food consumption and weight loss.  
3.2 Episodic Future Thinking. Imagining future events.  
Insufficient evidence   
One very small RCT suggests that episodic future thinking may reduce unhealthy food 
consumption post treatment. There was no investigation of effects on cravings or weight.  More evidence from adequately powered RCTs in community based samples is 
needed to generate definite conclusions and to assess the longer -term effectiveness of 
episodic future thinking on food consumption and weight loss.

 BOX S1. Narrative synthesis for : 3. techniques with unclear mechanisms of action  
 
Three studies investigated the use of two techniques (episodic future thinking and manipulating regulatory fit) which targete d impulsive eating, but 
did not describe or imply any proposed mechanism for how impulsive processes would be changed.    
3.1 Manip ulation of regulatory fit (N=2)  involves engaging in goal pursuit strategies that correspond (vs conflict) with the orientation of one’s 
self-regulation focus. It is thought that eagerness strategies fit a promotion focus and that vigilance strategies fit a prevention focus (Hong & Lee, 
2008; Regulatory focus theory; Higgins, 1997). The mechanism by which this might impact on impulsive processes is not clear, but may perhaps 
involve a reduction in self -regulatory resources required when regulatory fit is ac hieved (Hagger et al., 2010).  
Effects of manipulating regulatory fit on food consumption . In two RCTs Hong & Lee (2008) manipulated regulatory fit, through completion 
of regulatory fit questionnaires (Freitas & Higgins, 2002),  following an ego -depletion t ask. In the regulatory fit conditions participants were asked 
to list current aspirations (to induce promotion focus) and “eagerness methods” (ways to ensure those aspirations are achieve d), followed by a 
prevention questionnaire asking them to list any ob ligations (to induce prevention focus) and “vigilance methods” (ways of avoiding things that 
might prevent fulfilment of those obligations). In the regulatory non -fit induction condition participants were asked to list aspirations and vigilance 
means follo wed by obligations and eagerness means. They reported that increased regulatory fit significantly increased the likelihood of  choosing 
the healthy snack over the unhealthy snack choice post -treatment, relative to the control group, who in turn, were signif icantly more likely to choose 
the healthy snack option than the regulatory non -fit group. However, these two studies used very small student samples, and provided no sample 
size calculations.  
3.2 Episodic future thinking (N=1)  involves imagining future eve nts. The mechanism of action of this technique is unclear.  
Effects of episodic future thinking on food consumption and delay discounting.  One RCT involving overweight and obese women examined 
the effects of future event imagery (Daniel et al., 2013). The control group imagined recently experienced events. Episodic f uture thinking 
significantly reduced snack consumption post -treatment by 304 .8 calories compared with controls (d=1.09), and reduced delay discounting (d=1.5). 
However, this study was small (group size 12 -14), provided no sample size calculation, and reported differences between groups at baseline (which 
were controlled for in ana lyses).
