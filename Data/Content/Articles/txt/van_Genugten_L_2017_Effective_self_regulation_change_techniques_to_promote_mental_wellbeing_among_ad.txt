ABSTRACT
Mental wellbeing is influenced by self-regulation processes. However, little
is known on the efficacy of change techniques based on self-regulation to
promote mental wellbeing. The aim of this meta-analysis is to identifyeffective self-regulation techniques (SRTs) in primary and secondary
prevention interventions on mental wellbeing in adolescents. Forty
interventions were included in the analyses. Techniques were coded intonine categories of SRTs. Meta-analyses were conducted to identify the
effectiveness of SRTs, examining three different outcomes: internalising
behaviour, externalising behaviour, and self-esteem. Primary interventions
had a small-to-medium ( /overbarg= 0.16 –0.29) on self-esteem and internalising
behaviour. Secondary interventions had a medium-to-large short-term
effect (average /overbarg= 0.56) on internalising behaviour and self-esteem. In
secondary interventions, interventions including asking for social support(/overbarg=1.55, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.11 –1.98) had a great effect on
internalising behaviour. Interventions including monitoring and evaluationhad a greater effect on self-esteem ( /overbarg=0.39, 95% CI = 0.21 –0.57). For
primary interventions, there was not a single SRT that was associated with
a greater intervention effect on internalising behaviour or self-esteem.
No effects were found for externalising behaviours. Self-regulation
interventions are moderately effective at improving mental wellbeing
among adolescents. Secondary interventions promoting ‘asking for social
support ’and promoting ‘monitoring and evaluation ’were associated with
improved outcomes. More research is needed to identify other SRTs orcombinations of SRTs that could improve understanding or optimise
mental wellbeing interventions.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Mental health problems, including internalising (e.g., depression and anxiety, and suicidal thoughts)
and externalising behaviours (e.g., aggressive behaviours, conduct problems, and substance use) are
common among adolescents (Hankin et al., 1998 ; Kieling et al., 2011 ). In most Western countries, the
prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents is higher than 20%, and it has been suggested
that the number of young people experiencing mental health problems is increasing (Bor, Dean,
Najman, & Hayatbakhsh, 2014 ). Mental problems reduce quality of life and are likely to intensify

and persist over time, resulting in poor mental health during adulthood (Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, &
McGorry, 2007 ). Among adults, mental disorders have a mean past-year-to-lifetime prevalence of
38–57% (Moffitt et al., 2010 ).
Psychological wellbeing, is not so much the absence of negative states (WHO, 2013 ), but has been
linked to basic psychological needs such as autonomy, environmental mastery and perceived com-petence, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance (Deci &
Ryan, 2008 ; Ryff, 1995 ). Poor psychological wellbeing, internalising and externalising problems have
been associated with the inability to reach personal valued goals and poor self-regulation (e.g., Old-
ehinkel, Hartman, Ferdinand, Verhulst, & Ormel, 2007 ).
Self-regulation and psychological wellbeing
Self-regulation can be defined as ‘the ability to flexibly activate, monitor, inhibit, persevere and/or
adapt one’s behaviour, attention, emotions and cognitive strategies in response to direction frominternal cues, environmental stimuli and feedback from others, in an attempt to attain personally-rel-
evant goals ’(Moilanen, 2007 ). Self-regulation may improve psychological wellbeing, in three ways.
Active pursuit of such goals, including goal setting and planning, may contribute to wellbeing
because directing one’ s behaviour toward a certain goal may increase feelings of autonomy
(Sheldon & Elliot, 1999 ; Sheldon, Kasser, Smith, & Share, 2002 ). Second, goal achievement has a posi-
tive effect. Studies have found that successful attainment of personal goals leads to fulfilment, asense of meaning, competence and well-being (Carver & Scheier, 1990 ; Heckhausen, Wrosch, &
Schulz, 2010 ; Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001 ). Third, poor psychological wellbeing, and
emotional and behavioural problems may result from unsuccessful or inadequate goal striving.However, the effects of goal frustration can be prevented by using the right (emotional) coping strat-
egies, or timely goal disengagement and reengagement (Massey, Garnefski, & Gebhardt, 2009 ;
Wrosch, Scheier, Miller, Schulz, & Carver, 2003 ). Thus, goal striving, goal achievement, and processing
goal failure all contribute to mental wellbeing.
In other words, self-regulation interventions that focus on optimising self-regulation skills could
have positive effects on the mental health of adolescents, by improving their emotion regulation
and helping them to reach personally valued goals. Indeed, some evidence suggests that self-regu-
lation interventions can indeed improve psychological wellbeing (MacLeod, Coates, & Hetherton,
2008 ; Wrosch et al., 2003 ).
Previous meta-analyses have evaluated the effectiveness of mental health prevention pro-
grammes for adolescents (e.g., Durlak & Wells, 1997 ; Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, &
Schellinger, 2011 ; Haney & Durlak, 1998 ). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no systematic meta-ana-
lytic review has been conducted to examine what self-regulation strategies could be used to
promote psychological wellbeing and could prevent mental health problems among adolescents.
Hence, the present study aimed to examine to what extent self-regulation interventions have favour-able effects on indicators of psychological wellbeing among adolescents.
Within the present study we aimed to differentiate between primary and secondary prevention
mental health interventions. Primary prevention aims to promote mental health and to preventemotional and behavioural problems within the general population. Secondary (indicated) preven-
tion targets individuals with subclinical problems and aims to prevent serious dysfunctions (Haney
& Durlak, 1998 ). There are multiple reasons to differentiate between these types of interventions:
(1) given differences between populations differences in outcomes of psychological wellbeing are
likely, (2) different intervention techniques may be used and useful for intervening, and (3) previous
meta-analyses that have differentiated between primary and secondary prevention interventionshave shown that secondary prevention tends to be more effective than those designed for the
general population, particularly when the former are long-term interventions that are based on
theory (Browne, Gafni, Roberts, Byrne, & Majumdar, 2004 ; Haney & Durlak, 1998 ; Jane-Llopis,
Hosman, Jenkins, & Anderson, 2003 ; Merry, McDowell, Hetrick, Bir, & Muller, 2004 ).54 L .V A NG E N U G T E NE TA L .
Second, our aim was to identify which intervention techniques contribute to favourable outcomes
of an intervention. Even when self-regulation interventions contribute to favourable effects on indi-
cators of psychological wellbeing heterogeneity between studies is to be expected. In response,
within the field of health psychology, taxonomies of behaviour change techniques (e.g., Michie,
Ashford, Dombrowski, Bishop, & French, 2011 ; Kok et al., 2016 ) have been developed to be able to
code intervention components within a particular intervention, and to gain an understanding of
why particular interventions are more effective than others (e.g., van Genugten, Dusseldorp,
Webb, & van Empelen, 2016 ; Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ). In the
present study, we took a similar approach to identify core self-regulation change techniques,
which favourably affect indicators of psychological wellbeing. This is of particular interest, as such
an examination could contribute to gaining a better understanding of whether some change tech-niques are particularly useful for some outcomes (e.g., internalising problems (anxiety or depression),
externalising problems (e.g., aggression or anger), and feelings of self-worth), given that different self-
regulation functions may play a role (e.g., emotion regulation, impulse control, and goal pursuit). Thiswould help to further optimise mental health interventions targeting adolescents.
In sum, this review aims to answer the following questions:
(1) What is the effectiveness of primary and secondary prevention self-regulation interventions on
mental wellbeing among healthy adolescents and is there variation in the short- and long-term effects?
(2) Which self-regulation techniques (SRTs) are effective in these interventions and for which particu-
lar outcomes (internalising behaviours, externalising behaviours and self-esteem)?
Methods
The meta-analyses was conducted based on the Cochrane guidelines for reviews (Higgins & Green,
2011 ), with some adaptations in the search strategy.
Search strategy
A structured search of four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase)
was conducted including intervention studies published between 1990 and November 2012 (as an
exploratory search showed that many of the articles written before that time provide very little infor-
mation on intervention strategies and characteristics). Each search included the following terms, andvariations of the terms (using ‘OR’functions): ‘wellbeing ’,‘intervention ’,‘prevention ’,‘evaluation ’,
‘adolescen* ’, and ‘self-regulation ’. The search was limited to papers written in English, German, or
Dutch. The search was optimised for all consulted databases by adapting the query to the querylanguage of the interfaces used. The queries can be found in supplement A. After excluding dupli-
cates, the search resulted in 7881 unique manuscripts.
Eligibility and inclusion
A study was eligible for inclusion if it (1) described a self-regulation intervention that (2) aimed atimproving mental or psychological wellbeing or behaviour and that reported changes in wellbeing
(3) and is evaluated in a (quasi) randomised study among (4) adolescents. These criteria are describedbelow in more detail.
(1) An intervention was defined as a self-regulation intervention if it used techniques that were
related to behavioural or emotion self-regulation, including goal setting, planning,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 55
self-monitoring, feedback, coping, and relapse prevention (Knittle, Maes, & de Gucht, 2010 ). Such
aims should be mentioned in the abstract of the article or in the article itself.
(2) An intervention was considered to be aimed at improving well-being if at least one of the follow-
ing proxies of psychological wellbeing or behaviour related to well-being was an outcome
measure: well-being, quality of life, internalising and externalising behaviour (e.g., depressionor depressive feelings/thoughts/symptoms anxiety and aggressive behaviour), self-esteem,
(general) self-efficacy, self-perception and self-concept, locus of control, optimistic thinking
and hopelessness, positive and negative affect, psychological distress, or resilience. Substance-related behaviours and body image outcomes were excluded from the meta-analysis.
(3) The effectiveness of the intervention had to be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial or a
quasi-experimental design, in which pre- and post-intervention measurements must havetaken place and the self-regulation intervention group was compared to a control group.
Studies were excluded if they did not report both baseline and post-intervention data.
(4) The intervention needed to be developed and evaluated for adolescents. The inclusion criterion
was that the mean age of the participants had to be between 12 and 18 years. The participantscould be without symptoms (universal prevention), with an increased risk or with indications of
decreased well-being (targeted or indicated prevention). Studies could not include clinically diag-nosed participants (e.g., interventions aimed at adolescents with clinically diagnosed depression).
Interventions including such participant samples were excluded from this study.
The inclusion of studies took place in three phases, based on title, abstract, and full publication (all
by LVG and EM). If there was doubt about the suitability of a study in one phase, the study was
included in the next phase. Disagreements about inclusion in the third phase were discussed witha third reviewer (PVE) until consensus was reached. A summary of the flow of study inclusion and
exclusion can be found in Figure 1 .
Data extraction
Data from the included studies were extracted and coded by LVG, EM, and PVE based on a standar-
dised extraction form. The outcome variables were divided into three categories: internalising behav-
iour (e.g., depression, anxiety, and negative affect), self-esteem (e.g., positive affect, self-esteem, and
resilience), and externalising behaviour (e.g., anger and aggression). In addition, the post-tests andfollow-up measurements were divided into two periods: short-term (i.e., from final session up to
six months) and long-term (i.e., longer than six months). Descriptions of the primary and secondary
prevention studies, with outcomes and measurement periods are shown in Table 1 ; the intervention
strategies were extracted from the manuscript and summarised in Table 2 (the coding form can be
found in supplement B, the summarised results in supplement B and C).
Coding of the intervention characteristics and intervention strategies
There are two types of self-regulation: behavioural regulation and affect regulation (Austin & Vancou-ver,1996 ). We aimed to include both types of self-regulation. Therefore, we developed a taxonomy of
SRTs based on specific intervention strategies from the refined taxonomy of behaviour change tech-niques by Michie et al. ( 2011 ): this taxonomy specifically focusses on behaviour-related techniques,
but pays less attention to emotion-focussed strategies. First, we identified possible SRTs from this tax-
onomy (as the taxonomy includes change techniques from many social cognitive models). These
techniques were discussed among all authors, resulting in a list of 20 techniques. When codingthe included articles according to this syntax, we came across other techniques that could also
qualify as techniques promoting self-regulation processes but that were not included in the taxon-
omy by Michie et al. ( 2011 ) (or used other terminology). For example, cognitive restructuring was
used in 15 studies and defined as a separate method. These additional techniques were also included.56 L .V A NG E N U G T E NE TA L .
SRTs were only coded as being present when they were not used in the control group (Peters, de
Bruin, & Crutzen, 2015 ). Initial agreement between the reviewers on SRTs was 83.3%, calculated by
dividing the sum of the agreement per technique by the number of techniques). SRTs and definitionswere discussed among all authors until agreement was reached for all SRTs. Table 2 shows an over-
view of the SRTs coded. Given that most techniques were only used in one or two studies, which
would decrease the ability to find an effect for those techniques, all of the techniques were
grouped into categories. The categories were based on steps and determinants of self-regulation.For example, the category goal setting included the following: Goal setting (behaviour), Goal setting
(outcome), Planning for future, and Reflection of goals and aspirations . Nine categories were created:
goal setting, action planning, coping planning, management of stress and/or emotions, monitoringand/or evaluation, rewarding, cognitive behavioural therap (CBT) and/or cognitive restructuring,
social skills, and social support. Using this method, each study had a 1/0 (present/not present)
score for each group. For convenience, these nine groups will be referred to as SRTs.
Furthermore, the following intervention characteristics were extracted from the studies: theoreti-
cal basis, setting, level of prevention, level of delivery, person of delivery, duration of the intervention,and availability of homework assignments, a manual, or training. Duration of the intervention wascoded as a continuous variable. Initial agreement between the reviewers on SRTs was 100%, calcu-
lated by dividing the sum of the agreement per characteristic aspects by the number of character-
istics. Discrepancies were discussed among all authors.

Assessment of study quality
As studies with a weaker design tend to find stronger intervention effects, the relationship between
study quality and study effect was also examined (Moher et al., 1998 ). A nine-item coding scheme,
based on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (Cochrane
Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group, 2012 ), was used to assess the quality of the included
studies. This scheme was adapted because the original one included items that were not applicablefor this study (e.g., availability of post-intervention data: in this review, studies that did not have post-intervention data available were not included in this review). The adapted scheme had the following
parameters: method of allocation, length of follow-up measurement, conducting a process evalu-
ation, response rate, drop-out, comparability of study groups, inclusion of withdrawals in analyses,and conducting multilevel analyses in cluster randomised studies. Initial agreement between the
reviewers on SRTs was 95%, calculated by dividing the sum of the agreement per quality aspects
by the number of aspects. Discrepancies were discussed among all authors. These criteria werescored as 0 or 1 according to the scheme (see supplement C for a more detailed understanding of
the scoring). Next, the scores for these parameters were summed, resulting in an overall quality
score ranging from 0 to 8, with a higher score indicating better quality. Such an overall score preventsTable 2. SRTs: correspondence with taxonomy by Michie et al. ( 2011 ) and additional techniques.

multiple testing (i.e., testing each quality indicator separately). Year of publication and continent of
origin were also coded.
Calculation of effect sizes
The effect sizes were computed in comprehensive meta analyses (Borenstein, 2005 ), using the
means and standard deviations of the intervention and control groups at the pre-test and post-
test (or follow-up). If pre-post-test correlations were not reported ( n= 37), a correlation of .50 was
assumed between baseline and follow-up measurement. All effect sizes were expressed as
Hedges ’/overbarg, the unbiased estimate of Cohen ’sd, the standardised mean difference between the inter-
vention and control group.
If there was more than one control condition, the most passive one was used, for ease of interpret-
ation (Portnoy, Scott-Sheldon, Johnson, & Carey, 2008 ; Webb, Joseph, Yardley, & Michie, 2010 ).
Meta-analysis
A random effects model was used to compute the overall effect size (i.e., the weighted average effectsize across studies), because it was assumed beforehand that the variability between effect sizeswould be due to sampling error and variability in the population of effects. In other words, it was
assumed that there are unique differences in the set of true population effect sizes that are, for
example, associated with procedures, measures, or settings (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ).
If more than one indicator per outcome category was reported (e.g., both the beck depression
inventory and center for epidemiologic studies depression scale to assess internalising behaviour),the mean was used as the outcome. If multiple post-tests or follow-up measurements were availablein the above-defined short-term and long-term measurement period, the mean was used of the post-
measurements within the corresponding period.
To estimate the robustness of the overall effect sizes, the trim and fill method was used (Duval &
Tweedie, 2000 ). Funnel plots with the imputed values were inspected (see Figure 2 ), as well as the
difference between the overall effect size and the adjusted one. Some differences between the

observed and adjusted estimates were found for primary interventions but not for secondary inter-
ventions. This indicates that the latter effect-size estimates were robust but that there may be somepublication bias for primary interventions.
Subgroup meta-analyses (also called moderator analyses) were conducted to study whether the
mean effect size of interventions that included a SRT differed significantly from the mean effect sizeof interventions without an SRT. If so, the specific SRT can be considered a moderator of intervention
effectiveness. A mixed effects model was used in the meta-regression analysis, that is, a random
effects model within subgroups and a fixed effect model across subgroups, which is a recommendedapproach (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009 ). The p-value of the between groups Q-statistic
(contrast Q) indicated whether the grouping effect was significant (Borenstein et al., 2009 ). A two-sided
significance level of .05 was used to calculate confidence intervals (CIs) for each effect size. The meta-analyses and subgroup analyses were performed in CMA, version 2.2 (Borenstein, 2005).
Results
Primary interventions: description and overall effectiveness
Twenty-five interventions were aimed at primary prevention, that is, they targeted a universal popu-
lation. All interventions were delivered in school, and 11 interventions were delivered by a teacher,
the others mostly by a health professional. The mean length of the intervention was 11 weeks; 11interventions lasted less than 10 weeks. Twelve interventions had less than 12 hours of content,
while 15 interventions had more than 8 intervention sessions. Five studies included home assign-
ments for the participants, and 16 interventions had a manual or training for the health promoter.
In primary preventive interventions, the studies describing the short-term effects on internalising
behaviour ( /overbarg= 0.20; 95% CI 0.03 –0.38, Q-model 31.50), and the short-term ( /overbarg= 0.29; 95% CI 0.18 –0.41,
Q-model 25.58) and long-term effects ( /overbarg= 0.16; 95% CI 0.05 –0.26, Q-model 20.26) on self-esteem
showed positive effects (see Table 3 ). Primary preventions generally showed lower effect sizes at
longer term.
Primary interventions: SRTs and effectiveness
On average, the intervention used 3.72 behaviour change technique (BCT). Two interventions usedonly SRT, and three interventions used six SRTs. Only three interventions used rewarding . The most
popular SRTs were coping planning (used 21 times) and management of stress and emotions (20 times).
The largest effect sizes were found for asking for social support (/overbarg= 0.42*, 95% CI 0.10 –0.73) and
management of stress and emotions (/overbarg= 0.26*, 95% CI 0.04 –0.47).
Next, we examined which SRTs could explain differences in effects across primary prevention studies.
There was no SRT for which studies including this SRT were statistically significant more effective onimproving internalising behaviour or self-esteem than studies excluding this SRT (and vice versa) ( Table 4 ).

Secondary interventions: description and overall effectiveness
About half of the interventions were delivered in school ( n= 8), other locations were community
centres and training programmes. Ten interventions were delivered by a health professional, only
two by a teacher. Four interventions lasted longer than 10 weeks, the average duration was 9.9
weeks. Seven interventions had less than 12 hours of content, 3 lasted 20 hours or longer (mean dur-
ation was 16.7 hours). Eight interventions had more than eight intervention sessions. The averagenumber of sessions was 16.2. One intervention consisted of 90 sessions. Five studies included
home assignments for the participants, and nine interventions had a manual or training for the
health promoter.
Secondary interventions had statistically si gnificant effects on internalising behaviour ( /overbarg=
0.56; 95% CI 0.22 –0.90, Q-model 69.50) and self-esteem ( /overbarg= 0.56; 95% CI 0.34– 0.377, Q-model
37.03).
Secondary interventions: SRTs and effectiveness
On average, secondary interventions used 3.8 SRTs. Only one intervention used (asking for) social
support . The most popular SRTs were coping planning and skills (11 studies) and management of
stress and emotions (9 studies).
The intervention that include asking for social support (/overbarg= 1.55, 95% CI = 1.11 –1.98) was more
effective on internalising behaviour than those not including this SRT ( /overbarg= 0.39, 95% CI = 0.21 –0.57,
Q-between = 23.07, p< .001) (see Table 5 ).
Interventions that included monitoring and evaluation (/overbarg= 0.87, 95% CI = 0.63 –1.12) had a stronger
effect on self-esteem than interventions that did not ( /overbarg= 0.35, 95% CI = 0.18 –0.52; Qmodel = 12.31,

Discussion
The present meta-analytic study provides insight into the effectiveness of interventions to promote
mental wellbeing in adolescence, and the effect of SRTs in those interventions. Primary interventions
had a small-to-medium ( /overbarg= 0.16 –0.29) on self-esteem and internalising behaviour. Secondary inter-
ventions had a medium-to-large short-term effect ( /overbarg= 0.56) on internalising behaviour and self-
esteem. For primary interventions the effect sizes were lower at longer term follow-up, whereas sec-ondary interventions showed that positive outcomes were maintained at longer term follow-up. No
significant effects on externalising behaviour were found for either group of interventions. Interven-tions on average used four out of the nine SRT categories. For primary interventions, there was not a
single SRT that was associated with a greater intervention effect on internalising behaviour or self-
esteem. In secondary interventions, those including asking for social support had a great effect on
internalising behaviour. Those including monitoring and evaluation had a greater effect on self-
esteem.
Overall effect sizes
Secondary interventions were more likely to improve mental wellbeing, which confirms findings of
previous research (Browne et al., 2004 ; Haney & Durlak, 1998 ; Merry et al., 2004 ). This effect is
higher than the effects found by Durlak et al. ( 2011 ), in a meta-analysis of 213 school-based universal
interventions, and also higher than the effect size (ES) found in this meta-analyses for primary inter-
ventions. Secondary interventions are likely to be more effective, because their participants have lower
baseline values on positive outcomes (and higher baseline values on negative outcomes). In other
words, there is greater possibility for improvement than the general adolescent population. OtherTable 5. Moderator analyses of SRTs on the outcomes internalising behaviour and self-esteem for secondary prevention

reasons for the differences in effect sizes may, however, have to do with particular content of inter-
ventions. For secondary interventions we were able to show that effect size differences exist due tothe use of particular SRTs, but not for primary interventions.
Only two SRTs that significantly improve the effectiveness of secondary interventions could be
identified: asking for social support and monitoring and evaluation .
Asking for social support is an aspect of healthy social interaction; social interaction has a positive
relationship with various aspects of mental wellbeing. For example, feelings of relatedness are associ-ated with self-worth and self-esteem (Oberle, Schonert-Reichl, & Thomson, 2010 ), and interventions
aimed at improving communication skills improve well-being more than other types of interventions
(Durlak & Wells, 1997 ). This finding also corresponds to meta-analytic findings on the positive
relationship of social support on depression (Rueger, Malecki, Pyun, Aycock, & Coyle, 2016 ): The
type of social support and support sources, however, needs further investigation. Possibly, socialsupport helps to overcome negative thinking. However, when interpreting this finding, we must
be aware that only one intervention included this SRT.
The positive effect of monitoring and evaluation is in line with other studies and meta-analyses,
among others for its beneficial effects well-being (Cook et al., 2011 ), self-awareness (Kauer et al.,
2012 ), and changing health-related behaviour (Bravata et al., 2007 ; de Bruin et al., 2012 ; Dombrowski
et al., 2012 ; Greaves et al., 2011 ; Michie et al., 2009 ; Webb et al., 2010 ), behaviour in secondary inter-
ventions. Combining self-monitoring with other SRTs was found to be even more effective for behav-iour change, by Michie et al. ( 2009 ). We could not confirm this univariate effect of self-monitoring on
mental wellbeing in primary interventions.
Possibly, monitoring and evaluation may not be useful when adolescents are at risk for anxiety and
depression as these may promote negative thoughts, because it has been shown that self-focus isassociated with depression and anxiety because of maladaptive coping strategies (Mor & Winquist,
2002 ). Nevertheless, self-monitoring and evaluation, however, may be a very useful means to increase
feelings of self-control, when adolescence use adaptive coping strategies. It should be pointed out,
that increasing self-esteem may have an effect on internalising behaviours, in particular depression
(e.g., Sowislo & Orth, 2013 ).
As discussed, the meta-analyses did not identify SRTs that significantly increased the effectiveness
of primary interventions on internalising behaviour or self-esteem. Perhaps the identified SRTs in thisstudy are not the key intervention characteristics that determine the effectiveness of primary inter-
ventions. Based on theory, it was expected that more SRTs would be effective in promoting well-being in adolescence. For example, goal setting has previously been identified as a positive contribu-
tor to well-being (Carver & Scheier, 1982 ; Sheldon, Ryan, Deci, & Kasser, 2004 ). Personal goals are
important because they contribute to the process of defining one ’s sense of self and thus have an
important effect on the way in which people direct their development. Other interventions may
also influence well-being. For example, Rebar et al. ( 2015 ) showed that physical activity intervention
has a medium effect on depression and a small effect on anxiety in non-clinical adult populations.
Another problem may be concerning our grouping of SRTs. Although we had reasons to group
similar SRTs, the categorisation of SRTs may have been too broad, which may have masked the
true effects of the individual SRTs. Furthermore, operationalisation or implementation of the SRTsmay not have been optimal. In other words, recommendations for implementation may not have
been followed. For example, coping planning requires identification of high-risk situations and prac-
tice of the coping response (Bartholomew et al., 2010 ). When these parameters are not met, it is unli-
kely that coping planning is effective. Ideally, studies would mention not only whether they use an SRT
or BCT, but also the quality of implementation (de Bruin, Viechtbauer, Hospers, Schaalma, & Kok, 2009 ;
Peters et al., 2015 ). Unfortunately, the studies in this review did not describe the implementation in
any detail. Therefore, we cannot check whether the recommendations were met. Further, at the inter-vention level, successful implementation is an important predictor of intervention success (Durlak &
DuPre, 2008 ; Weare & Nind, 2011 ). In the studies in the current meta-analyses, little was reported
about implementation and implementation problems.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 65
Strengths and limitations
This is one of the first studies that investigated the effect of self-regulation change technique cat-
egories on mental wellbeing outcomes. However, only 40 studies met the criteria to be included
in this review; most studies were rejected because of the intervention did not have self-regulation
ingredients, did not assess indicators of well-being as an outcome or had a weaker study design.
In order to increase statistical power and thus gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of
SRTs, it would be valuable to repeat the analyses with a larger set of studies. This highlights theneed for methodologically stronger studies with longer term measurements aimed at promoting
well-being among adolescence. In this meta-analysis, studies indexed in four online databases
were included. As such, this computer search may have resulted in a limited sample of the relevantliterature. A larger set of studies can be achieved by broadening the search strategy, for example, also
include grey literature, approaching authors from this field for unpublished results. However, it
remains important to check the quality of such studies and its relation with effectiveness. Further-more, 19 studies used a clustered design. This clustered design was not taken into account in our
meta-analyses.
As most interventions included multiple SRTs ( n= 34), and because we categorised individual
techniques into self-regulation change technique s, no conclusions about the effects of individual
techniques can be made. In addition, there was a large variety in the reporting of change tech-
niques used. For example, several techniques w ere used relating to coping: coping planning,
coping training, coping skills, and relapse prevention. Many studies failed to define such tech-niques any further and they could not be further defined in the taxonomy. Therefore, there is a
risk that SRTs were incorrectly categorised. This a lso demonstrates the need for clear explanations
of the SRTs used in intervention studies. Further more, existing taxonomies often define SRTs for
behaviour change only and were therefore not suitable for this review on mental wellbeing,
where emotional regulation is also very impo rtant. We conclude that affect regulation was
under-represented in e xisting taxonomies.
Recommendations for research and practice
This study shows that interventions employing self-regulation change techniques have a small-to-positive effect on well-being among adolescents. However, we were only able to identify a few effec-
tive SRTs. More methodologically stronger studies and reviews should be conducted to study the
effectiveness of self-regulation interventions, also those with other outcomes (e.g., weight manage-ment) and those for other target groups (e.g., elderly people). In this meta-analysis, many articles
were excluded because of their design (e.g., no baseline measurement). Although we examined
the contribution of SRTs, it should be noted that most interventions used several SRTs. As such,the effects of a study cannot be fully related to the SRT. New studies should ensure that the
effects of specific techniques are evaluated by describing these techniques explicitly. Also, interven-
tion studies should report more information on parameters of use, quality of delivery, control groupcontent (de Bruin et al., 2009 ; Peters et al., 2015 ), and moment of measurement. Moreover, the mech-
anisms of change techniques need to be explored in order to understand why techniques are or arenot important for certain outcomes or target groups. For example, Ashford and colleagues havestudied which techniques can be used to promote self-efficacy for physical activity (Ashford,
Edmunds, & French, 2010 ).
To conclude, self-regulation interventions were found to be small to moderately effective at pro-
moting well-being. Targeting adolescents at high risk for psychological wellbeing could benefit fromthe SRTs ‘asking for social support ’and ‘monitoring and evaluation ’, possibly in that order. It is essen-
tial that future studies are well designed, methodologically strong and pay attention to reporting in
order to facilitate meta-analyses and thereby develop the field.66 L .V A NG E N U G T E NE TA L .
