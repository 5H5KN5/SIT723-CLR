Abstract
Background: Traditional methods of process evalua tion encompass what components were
delivered, but rarely uncover how practitioner s position themselves and act relative to an
intervention being tested. This could be crucial for expanding ou r understanding of implementation
and its contribution to intervention effectiveness.
Methods: We undertook a narrative analysis of in-dep th, unstructured field diaries kept by nine
community development practition ers for two years. The practi tioners were responsible for
implementing a multi-component, preventive, co mmunity-level intervention  for mothers of new
babies in eight communities, as part of a cluster randomised community intervention trial. We
constructed a narrative typology of approaches to practice, dr awing on the phenomenology of
Alfred Schutz and Max Weber's Ideal Type theory.
Results: Five types of practice emerged, from a highly  'technology-based' type that was faithful to
intervention specifications, through to a 'romantic' type that held re lationships to be central to daily
operations, with intact relationsh ips being the final arbiter of intervention success. The five types
also differed in terms of how others involved in  the intervention were ch aracterized, the narrative
form ( e.g., tragedy, satire) and where and how tran sformative change in  communities was best
created. This meant that differen t types traded-off or managed the priorities of the intervention
differently, acco rding to the deeply held values of their type.
Conclusions: The data set constructed for th is analysis is unique. It reve aled that practitioners not
only exercise their agency within interventions, th ey do so systematically, that is, according to a
pattern. The typology is the first of its kind and, if  verified through replication, may have value for
anticipating intervention dynamics and expl aining implementation variation in community
interventions.
Introduction
Although there are established methods for tracking the
delivery of health promotion and preventive interven-
tions [1,2], the dynamic of what happens in practice stillremains elusive [3]. Many large-scale community-level
preventive interventions over the last 20 years have failed
or have had very modest effects [4,5]. This has been attrib-
uted in part by many commentators to the fact that inves-Published: 14 December 2009

'black box' of an intervention, complicated also by imple-
mentation reporting inadequacies [6-9]. Implementation
science has thus emerged as a promising new field of
investigation [10]. Understandings are needed that appre-
ciate the complexity of the phenomenon, taking into
account the sometimes vexed experiences of practitioners
at the coal face of intervention implementation. In partic-
ular, the practitioner's viewpoint may be critical for illu-
minating theories of action that could strengthen
intervention effectiveness [11].
This study set out to explore the experience of community
development practitioners implementing a new commu-
nity-based universal preventive intervention in maternal
health. The paper begins by describing the research con-
text and data collection methods. We then describe the
construction of a narrative typology of community inter-
vention practice. Such a typology could be used to antici-
pate implementation challenges (prior to or during)
intervention implementation. It may also assist in the
interpretation of intervention outcomes. We conclude by
discussing the implications of the typology for practition-
ers and researchers interested in gaining greater insight
into the dynamics of community health interventions.
Methods
PRI SM (Program of Resources Information and Support
for Mothers) was conducted as a large-scale community
cluster randomized trial comprised of eight intervention
communities and eight comparison communities (n =
18,555 women). The goal was to prevent post-natal
depression and improve maternal health. The setting was
Victoria, Australia. PRISM involved a range of primary
care and community-based strategies [see [12]]. This
included training for general practitioners and maternal
and child health nurses, as well as information kits and
initiatives facilitated by a local steering committee. Nine
community development officers (CDOs) were employed
for two years (one per intervention community, or in one
case, two job-sharing in one community). The CDOs were
the primary agents in PRISM's implementation in relation
to the community-based strategies. The research pre-
sented here was undertaken as a part of an independent
concurrent project called EcoPRISM. EcoPRISM was an
economic and ecological evaluation of PRISM [13]. The
EcoPRISM project obtained ethics approval from LaTrobe
University, Melbourne, Australia (Reference number 00/
100)
Data collection
An agreement of the CDOs' employment was to docu-
ment aspects of their practice for the EcoPRISM project.
This included maintaining a field diary over the two years
of the intervention's implementation. The use of diaries in
research tends to fall into two broad categories. The firstinvolves the analysis of existing diaries or journals written
by individuals within a particular historical context, such
as the diary of Anne Frank [14]. The second category is the
use of 'solicited' diaries as a data collection method. A
range of qualitative and quantitative analytic techniques
are then applied to the analysis of such data (for a detailed
description of the use of diaries in social research see
[14]).The use of 'solicited' diaries have a strong tradition
in disciplines investigating peoples behaviour over time.
For example 'time use' diaries have been used in studies
that investigate the way people allocate time to particular
activities [15]. Patient diaries are commonly used in stud-
ies of adherence with medication regimes [16]. However,
there is less of a tradition in the use of diaries or journals
in studies of professional practice with the exception of
education, where diaries or journals are used by students
or teachers as tools for reflection [17]. The key features of
a diary include: some 'regularity' to the entries 'over a
period of time' [14]; diaries are personal, that is, written
by one person [14]; they are written in a 'contemporane-
ous' manner [14], that is, written at about the time of an
event; and diaries create a record [14]. This incorporates
'what an individual considers relevant and important. It
may include events, activities, interactions, impressions,
and feelings' [[14] p.2]. For the purposes of evaluating
intervention implementation from the perspective of
practitioners, a 'solicited' diary method was the most
appropriate approach.
The diaries in our study aimed to capture the CDOs'
reflections, feelings, and theories regarding intervention
implementation. The diaries were either handwritten,
electronic files, or emails. Some were a combination of
these. The CDOs spent approximately 1.5 hours a week
on documentation, including the field diaries [18], and
the average diary consisted of approximately 40,000
words [18].The diaries were usually sent from the CDOs
to the research team once a month. They ranged from a
couple of entries a week, to once a month when the inter-
vention work demanded all of their time [18]. There is
conflicting evidence (from diary studies) as to the nature
of 'respondent fatigue' [19] and whether diary entries and
response rates decline over time. A study of the effects of
communal gardening on the health of older people
applied a diary method over approximately 23 weeks and
found that through 'continued researcher support'
respondent fatigue could be prevented [19]. This is con-
sistent with our experience. The CDOs also maintained
more traditional forms of intervention documentation
that are described elsewhere [12,13]. Ongoing contact
and support from the EcoPRISM research team over the
two years of intervention implementation resulted in a
data set that was rich with detail.
The field diaries remained confidential between the CDO
and the EcoPRISM Research Fellow (TR). This agreement
Implementation Science  2009, 4:80 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/80
Page 3 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)was extended to include an EcoPRISM co-investigator
(PH) at the end of the two-year implementation period,
with the consent of the CDOs. The restricted access to the
data was designed to provide a safe environment in which
CDOs could talk about the difficulties of implementation
as well as the success stories. Periodic interviews with
CDOs (34 in total) were also undertaken. These inter-
views provided an opportunity to capture the reflections
of CDOs who were less comfortable with writing [19].
These were transcribed and included in the narrative data
set to supplement what the diaries recorded. Primary ana-
lytic attention was paid to the field diaries as the prospec-
tive narrative data.
The result was a large data set (approximately 1,500
pages) outlining the challenges, triumphs, and personal
pitfalls of implementing an intervention. Practitioners
wrote descriptions of meetings and events; confessions of
things going wrong; personal challenges of living and
working in a community; explanations of success and fear
of failure. They also provided detailed assessments of
community infrastructure, identity, and culture.
After the first three months of data collection and analysis,
an 80-page report was constructed that raised general
issues for the PRISM research team to use in formative
evaluation [20]. This also allowed the CDOs opportunity
to see how their data and insights were being used and to
comment on issues raised. After this, no formal progress
reports were constructed. But, as diaries were read and
interviews undertaken, any key points that might be of
value for adjusting the intervention were raised within
memos and in meetings between the EcoPRISM research
team and the PRISM research team. The PRISM research
team also monitored PRISM process and adjusted the
intervention in response.
Our purpose was to not simply reveal details of what
CDOs were doing, but to see if we could construct models
of practice from the unique insight the data set provided.
We collected and analysed this data abductively (rather
than inductively) and, as such, our approach is based on
the following epistemological assumptions [21]: our
(social scientific) knowledge will be gained from the sub-
jective meanings of the CDOs (gathered via field diary and
interviews) and the concepts they use to understand their
practice [21]; much of the CDOs' practice (and program
implementation more generally) occurs in a 'taken for
granted' or routine way [21]; and in order to gain access to
the language or meaning given to their activities, we may
have to use methods (such as diaries) to create the condi-
tions for reflection [21]. Through the application of
abductive reasoning, pre existing theory may be applied to
provide added insights into the analysis of the meaning
provided by the CDOs themselves [21]. We have drawnon a number of theoretical and conceptual frameworks to
ensure our analysis is relevant to the research task at hand.
This is consistent with an abductive strategy [21]. The ana-
lytic steps in this analysis are described below.
Narrative analysis and individual narratives
Narrative analysis aims to uncover the underlying subjec-
tive meaning structures that form the basis of how people
come to understand and evaluate the world over time
[22]. The focus is not just on what happened but what is
revealed by the way a 'story is told' [22]: the plot, the posi-
tion of the characters [23], the enablers, and constraints.
Narrative is an interdisciplinary research approach that
has been used in illuminating experience of illness
[24,25] and within a range of disciplines, such as educa-
tion [26,27] and sociology [28,29]. Narrative analysis was
therefore an ideal choice to get deep inside the private
contexts of practice [30]. Alternatively we could have
undertaken a thematic or content analysis of the diary
data. However, this would have 'decontextualised' the
data, as themes are carved out and analysed independ-
ently of the context of their creation [31] Thematic analy-
sis also removes or downplays the significance of time
[18]. Time is a critical component of a narrative analysis
in two ways. First, it assumes that the past and the future
come to bear on present experiences [32] and the deci-
sion-making of the CDOs. Second, by maintaining the
vantage point of the one practitioner, we learn about their
interpretations of events over time [22]
While many studies that undertake a narrative analysis
draw on interview data, there is no epistemological reason
as to why diary data are not conducive to narrative analy-
sis [14]. As a method of data collection, the diaries
allowed the CDOs to reflect on their own practice in their
own words. They had greater control over what was writ-
ten about or excluded [19]. This degree of control over the
data could be viewed as a limitation of the method if
undertaking a content analysis. That is, where the factual
accuracy of the events recorded is paramount (for an
example of the content analysis of diaries see [33]). How-
ever, a narrative analysis is less concerned with whether
the events happened exactly as described and more con-
cerned with 'identifying the structure which underpins
specific narratives and the ways in which these structures
enables the narrator to make sense of and present their
lives' [[14] p.89]. It focuses attention on the interpretation
of events rather than the events themselves [34].
Analysing plot structure is a common form of narrative
analysis [31]. However, codifying narrative data is diffi-
cult [31]. The analyst cannot afford to decontextualise the
data (as in thematic analysis) while looking for larger
meaning structures that make up a narrative. The context
in which a narrative is constructed becomes a part of the
Implementation Science  2009, 4:80 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/80
Page 4 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)narrative itself [22]. So, coding was undertaken in two
ways. Firstly, sensitizing narrative concepts such as
whether the text was descriptive or evaluative in nature
[35] were used to assist in applying a narrative lens to the
data. Primary coding consisted of analytic notes attached
to sections of text. These analytic notes comprised state-
ments or evaluations of narrative structure and subse-
quent themes. A set of narrative questions/themes guided
this analysis [18] such as how the practitioner position
themselves in the telling of the story and the context of the
story telling occasion [22] This approach to handling the
data is consistent with the phenomenological aim of
understanding the meaning people give to their lives in
context and over time [32,36]. For a detailed description
of methods see [18]. The two-stage analysis culminated
first in the construction of eight individual narratives.
Each practitioner narrative was then abstracted further
into one of five types that make up the typology, as shown
in Figure 1. Practitioner narratives were connected to a
type if they encompassed many (but not necessarily all) of
the characteristics of the type. Practitioner two was the
only exception, encompassing key characteristics of three
types.
The rationale and development of a typology
Our interest is in abstracting meanings relevant to under-
standing 'course-of-action' [37] within a confined context.
The result is the construction of a model or abstract
description [21] of community-level intervention prac-
tice. For the model constructed in this study, we use the
label of typology because it is comprised of a taxonomy of
types of practice. In our case, the typology consists of a
series of 'ideal types'. An ideal type is a technical term
developed by Max Weber that refers to the creation of an
analytic construct built from various aspects or character-
istics of a given phenomenon [38]. Alfred Schutz who
built on Max Weber's theory contends that ideal types can
be thought about in two distinct ways. The 'personal ideal
type' refers to a person who communicates [36]. The
'course of action' ideal type refers to the 'expressive proc-
ess itself' or the product of that process [[36] p.187]. In
other words, it is the practice, rather than the practitioner,
that is the focus of our study. The CDOs' practice is a com-
bination of action and events and the narration of such
action and events
While we draw on Weber's 'ideal type' theory, for the sake
of simplicity we will hereafter use the term 'Type' (with a
capital T) when referring to an ideal type. Max Weber
never intended the term 'ideal' to refer to a 'morally supe-
rior' way of acting [39], and we want to avoid any confu-
sion for the reader. This is not a study of best practice. The
construction of explanatory models or typologies from
qualitative data is evident in a range of studies by scholars
in other fields. For an example of the construction of idealtype narratives from interview data see [29]. For an exam-
ple of the construction of a typology from interview data
see [40].
According to Weber's, theory, a constructed type, while
containing no falsehoods, 'contains no particular state-
ments of fact' (emphasis ours) [[38], p. 90] because it is
not constructed to represent customary expectations or to
test micro-predictions in the immediate sense. Rather, its
logic involves the surfacing of fixed relationships among
phenomena of interest that allow the analyst to see a
meta-theme that might not otherwise be observed [38].
Linguistic typologies, for example, study and classify lan-
guages according to their structural features. The typology
allows the linguist to trace higher order and historic pat-
terns that inform, for example, our understanding of the
spread of human populations. But to know the meaning
of any particular word, a linguist still uses a dictionary. In
the same sense, our intention was to construct a typology
that would alert researchers and practitioners to dynamics
and dimensions that might be missing in the methods for
implementation evaluation used traditionally. But there
are numerous methods to know precisely what people do
and when in a community intervention, such as event logs
kept by practitioners [1] and observational monitoring by
third parties [41]. These were also methods used within
EcoPRISM [13].
Determining the attributes of the typology
We have drawn on narrative literature to identify critical
characteristics of a narrative, such as the plot (organising
theme) [34] and characterisation of the 'supporting cast'
[23]. Attributes one to six are drawn from this literature
[22,23,32,34,42,43]. The seventh attribute comes directly
from our research objective in understanding community-
level intervention practice. We have deliberately focused
analytic attention on the social contexts of practice and
how practitioner agency is defined. By 'agency' we mean
the nature of practitioner 'action' [44].
1. Organising theme
The 'organising theme' creates a consistency in how the
practitioners evaluate situations or events [34]. The
'organising theme' (or plot) is at the heart of a narrative
[34]. This may be a metaphor or a strategy of some sort.
For example, restitution is the 'organising theme' [34] for
a narrative developed by Frank [24] to describe the way in
which some people come to understand their illness as a
journey back to the health they experienced prior to ill-
ness. The 'organising theme' [34] transcends the actuali-
ties of daily life. By looking beyond these activities or
events we learn something of what motivates the protago-
nist.
Implementation Science  2009, 4:80 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/80

(page number not for citation purposes)2. Narrative form
By narrative form we mean the temporal flow of a practi-
tioner's evaluations of the interventions implementation
over time [23]. We have drawn on literary theory to add
depth to our understanding of plots, such as comedy or
tragedy [42,43]. Other qualitative studies have also drawn
on these types of narrative form in their analysis of narra-
tive data [28].
3. Protagonists position
The protagonist in this analysis refers to the practitioner.
The protagonist's position is where the practitioner posi-
tions themselves in their narration. For instance, a practi-
tioner may be the chief protagonist of their narrative [23].
Or, they might cast themselves more as an observer than
the chief actor.
4. Characterization of  the supporting cast
This refers to how a practitioner may characterize the peo-
ple they incorporate into their narrative. Gergen and Ger-
gen [23] refer to these people as the 'supporting cast'.
While there are likely to be similar people or organiza-
tions within the practitioner's narration, the constructed
types differ on how these people or organizations areinterpreted. These interpretations of others feed into the
practitioners views on what to do and how to act [23]. The
supporting cast [23] might be described only when they
cause conflict and trouble, for example. Or they may be
reported on throughout as supporters of the protagonist.
They might be given roles as interpreters of events.
5. Position or role of the audience
Within a narrative the audience (or listener) is an impor-
tant part of the process of story telling [22]. The position
or role that the audience is ascribed reveals something of
the motivation of the practitioner. The audience may
serve a legitimizing function as the practitioner seeks
understanding from the audience. The audience may also
be asked to challenge convention as they are made aware
of alternative interpretations of events. The CDOs were
aware that they were writing a diary that would be read
and analysed by the EcoPRISM researchers, but did they
take the trouble to explain or pardon their actions to the
audience? Did they appear to seek approval or sanction?
Or was the audience largely ignored?
6. Resolution in context
This refers to a narrative's 'valued endpoint' [42]. The res-
olution of a narrative is value laden and interwoven with
the other attributes of the typology. Resolution of the nar-
rative is closely tied to the organising theme [34] and form
of the narrative [23]. Did a story end on a high point or a
low point? Did it appear to stop midstream and unre-
solved? The final diary entries reveal how a practitioner
comes to understand or evaluate their time as an interven-
tion practitioner. However, the resolution of a narrative
does not equate to the ending of the intervention. This is
an important point. The CDOs completed their final diary
entries when their employment on the intervention
ended. This was a time of uncertainty within the overall
PRISM project.
7. Orientation of their practice
This refers to the contexts of practice and the type of
agency the practitioners embrace in order to effect change.
In other words, this refers to where and how practitioners
create transformative change in their community. For
example, a practitioner may spend most of their time
working within organizational settings influencing policy
development. Alternatively they may spend their time
raising awareness of an issue within a broader community
setting in the hope that community members will lobby
local authorities for change.
Checking the plausibility of the typology
An abductive logic was applied to the construction of the
typology and refers to the process of drawing on peoples
descriptions of social life to create social scientific descrip-
tion or explanation [21,45]. This is like the chemical proc-The collapsing of individual  narratives into a typology Figure 1

If the process has worked, the result should be a model of
'typical courses of action' in typical contexts by typical
people [45]. In other words, similar practitioners placed
in similar intervention contexts with similar characteris-
tics should behave similarly. This is what Schutz refers to
as the 'postulates of adequacy' and 'logical consistency'
[37]. To test the plausibility of the model, we engaged in
presentations and dialogues with research participants,
other practitioners, and researchers.
The typology was constructed after the CDOs completed
their employment. The narrative analysis of data was then
undertaken over 12 months and from this the typology
was constructed.
Results
Characteristics of the five types
Table 1 presents the characteristics of each of the five con-
structed types according to three of the seven attributes
that make up the typology. The full typology showing all
seven attributes can be accessed as an additional file to
this manuscript (see Additional File 1; Table S1 - A typol-
ogy of practice in community level interventions). Each of
the types set out with the same goal of implementing the
PRISM intervention as defined by the PRISM investiga-
tors. Yet, the narrative types differ markedly on how they
characterize the key players [23], the kind of organising
theme [34] that underlies their understanding, and the
manner in which they orient their practice.
Illustrations
We illustrate some characteristics of each of the types
according to the key attributes of the typology, and in
doing so highlight the typology's overall heuristic value.
Greater detail about each type will be presented in later
papers. The quotations presented here have been derived
from the analytic notes drawn on to develop the individ-
ual narratives that were then abstracted into each of the
types. All identifying information has been removed from
the quotations.
Contrasting roles of agencies and people
The contrasting roles played by agencies and people in the
intervention provide our first illustration of the types. The
Heroic Type, takes the narrative form of a heroic comedy
[43] and the hero is the practitioner, the hero alone is
responsible for the intervention outcomes. Other agencies
and people are usually characterized as blockers [43] The
'blocking characters' create obstacles for the hero [43].
This forms 'the action of the comedy, and the overcoming
of them, the comic resolution' [[43], p.164].
Blockers are framed as such because they have power [43].
This may be expressed in control of resources, decisions,or discourses. Senior managers are examples of people in
control of resources. Researchers are examples of people
in control of discourses. The CDOs who illustrate charac-
teristics of this type spend considerable narrative space
within their diaries discussing blocking characters [43],
their impact on the CDOs practice, and ways of working
with or around them. Blocking characters [43] occupy a
moral space in the narrative type, as the following quota-
tion illustrates. The hero's feelings are central to the story:
'Hi [EcoPRISM name], I haven't written anything for
ages towards the journal -- have felt pretty snowed
under. I have just had a meeting with [manager] this
morning -- need to debrief with someone -- [the man-
ager] has this way of making me feel as if I have totally
lost my ground -- she turns arguments around and
then has a way of putting the other person down -- all
I seem to be able to do is defend my position. It's a
mind [expletive]! A few months ago she was giving me
messages about demanding too much from her and
now I get messages about not giving her enough infor-
mation.' (The Heroic Type: seven months into the
intervention)
In this example, we hear about both the blocker and the
blocking tactics of a manager delivering mixed messages
about their relationship with the CDO. This is a field diary
extract from the first seven months of the intervention.
Over the next six months, this practitioner develops new
strategies to manage the blocking tactics of the manager as
the following quotation highlights.
'We don't tell her things yet, you know, because you're
just never exactly sure what the political flavour of the
thing is and she can just kill things so easily. So it's
come up time and time again you know, 'Don't say it
like this, say it like that...' It's just fascinating.' (The
Heroic Type: eleven months into the intervention)
In contrast, with the Satirist Type, other people feature in
the story centrally, but in ways less directly connected with
the protagonist (the practitioner). The story is played out,
not with the practitioner's actions, but in his/her appraisal
of the roles of others in bringing about the intervention
success or otherwise. This does not mean that the practi-
tioner obviates all agency in the action. Rather, there is
social distance in how the action is described -- less
engagement, more observation, and heavy use of wit and
irony to demonstrate that the 'truth,' or how things really
are, is known only to the practitioner [43]. Rather than
active blockers (the hero's narrative), what confronts the
satirist is the apathy of people who stifle action. These
people embody apathy and institutions allow it to exist
via their conventions. These are key characteristics of a sat-
ire [43]. The status quo thwarts the implementation of the

(page number not for citation purposes)new program or policy as the following quotation high-
lights.
'... and there's always some you know, kind of
unnamed bureaucratic reason why you can't do some-
thing new because the natural position of the bureauc-
racy [is] to say um, 'better not do something new
really', and that's really what I was getting and he was
a perfectly nice man.' (The Satirist Type: ten months
into the intervention)
Character assessments are the vehicle through which the
audience is made aware of barriers to intervention imple-
mentation.
' [Manager] rings me back. Her enthusiasm is distinctly
controlled. Arrange meeting time. Even if her agency
doesn't want to be involved, it's important politically
not to put their noses out of joint, so I'll go optimistic
and positive, and hope she picks up some positivity of
attitude if not of commitment. I'll let her tell me howmuch they're doing, and what I should be doing.' (The
Satirist Type: two months into the intervention).
The Satirist Type ridicules people who claim to be sup-
portive and empathic to the goals of the intervention, but
act inconsistently with this. At the same time, the satirist
plays the role of 'letting' those people maintain that
faÃ§ade. The audience/reader is briefed on the situation
instead, a situation that enshrines the satirist in a 'wisdom'
role. It is also a passive role. One gets the sense that the
hero is 'out there' risking life and limb to make the inter-
vention work, whereas the satirist is taking care of the
interpretation of who will bear responsibility or be
blamed. That does not mean at all that the satirist is a sab-
oteur or a pessimist, only that the satirist sees the interven-
tion as simply one event in the greater scheme of things
and interpreting that scheme is the substance of the narra-
tive.

(page number not for citation purposes)change takes place. As a result, they spend their time nur-
turing and maintaining these relationships. This is
achieved in the following example through time spent
meeting people and gaining local intelligence
'So, it was an exhausting day, but very useful. I wonder
whether I need to meet in person with everyone that
approaches re PRISM. It's the way I work I guess, but it
does make it tiring, but I feel like I've had the chance
to build a rapport with these women...' (The Romantic
Type: two months into the intervention)
The Romantic Type measures the quality of their work by
the quality of these relationships. The Romantic Type pri-
oritizes relationships over and above other tasks of inter-
vention implementation. In the following example, the
practitioner sensed they were behind in tasks associated
with the development of intervention components, due to
the time spent talking with mothers groups and generally
building relationships in the community. As the quota-
tion highlights, the practitioner was pleased, once expec-
tations for assembly of key resource materials for PRISM
were clarified, that she had not prioritised those tasks and
made promises to the community she couldn't keep.
'... I had been worried about being behind [the other
CDOs] in terms of signing and sealing vouchers, and
compiling the information directory. I knew I had
spent more time on general community development,
and less on finalising those specific tasks. After Friday
[when the PRISM research team clarified what was
required in compiling the vouchers and information
directory] I was glad I'd gone about things that way.
Because some of the clarifications helped define more
precisely what we should concentrate on in the vouch-
ers and info directory, I felt that had I moved quicker
on these I might have barked up the wrong tree, made
promises I couldn't fulfil, got myself into a few sticky
corners. A good community development worker will
always find a way around this of course [if] it happens
but since timelines are tight, I'm glad not to have to
adjust, trim and backtrack at this point.' (The Roman-
tic Type five months into the intervention)
In this example, the CDO is relieved that they don't have
to break promises made in the community in order to
meet tight deadlines. Relationships can remain intact. The
pre-eminent place of relationships within this narration
continues even when it becomes apparent to the CDO
that key local players in PRISM's implementation may not
truly understand the intervention, as the following quota-
tion highlights.
'Yesterday I had coffee with [two nurses] and while
very cordial and great fun, I came away with thedepressing feeling that neither of them really under-
stands what they're doing with PRISM, that they see
PRISM as just another demand on their time, as some-
thing they have to do. I sympathize...' (The Romantic
Type: seventeen months into the intervention)
The Romantic Type's way of orientating their practice is in
stark contrast to the Technologist Type who values the
directives of management and their own capacity to com-
ply to expectations such as deadlines. The Technologist
Type understands the intervention to be a series of core
elements to be implemented locally and integrated into
local institutional settings. These form the settings for
practice. Power is deferred to the technologies of the inter-
vention. This deference of power results in an adherence
to the technological components of the intervention.
Compliance with instructions, deadlines, and requests
from the PRISM research team take up considerable narra-
tive space. This is a consistent evaluative position from
start to finish, and is representative of a stable narrative
form [42]. In the following quotation, we sense the frus-
tration with other CDOs who don't seem to value meeting
deadlines in the same way as the Technologist Type.
'I haven't received many (1) Service Directory drafts
from the other [CDOs]. The first week of March is over
(nearly). Maybe they are working on a different time
line to me? Am I losing the plot?' (The Technologist
Type: four months into the intervention)
Similarly, in the following example the practitioner is
working out what role the local steering committee will
play in intervention implementation. Her default posi-
tion is to look to the original instructions and if that is not
clear then to contact the PRISM research team for direc-
tion.
CDO:....' I'm still trying to work out what we'll do at
our first meeting and then trying to, I guess, work out
what their goals are. I know it's all documented about
what their role is but I suppose having a clear idea of
what sorts of things they'll do, and I need to know that
for them to know what to do of it, yeah. That's still a
bit like mud at the moment, yeah.'
Interviewer: 'And how are you going to clear that up?'
CDO: 'Oh, I don't know, ring up the PRISM team and
get them to help me. [laughter] I'll ring them up and
ask them, yep.' [laughter] (The Technologist Type: two
months into the intervention)
In deferring power to the intervention technologies, the
Technologist Type acts as a conduit for the values and
principles that are embedded in the design of such tech-
Implementation Science  2009, 4:80 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/80
Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)nologies [46]. The technological voice of program rhetoric
permeates the following example as the practitioner iden-
tifies a possible source of tension between the local com-
munity views and those of the PRISM intervention.
'Conversation with [a PRISM coordinator] re [support]
group illustrated some tension between local expecta-
tions/views and PRISM aims re what PRISM is about,
[it] was useful to have discussion with [a PRISM coor-
dinator] re PRISM perspective!' (The Technologist
Type: seventeen months into the intervention)
Whereas for the Romantic Type power is exercised and
gained in relational settings, for the Technologist Type
change is dependent on the quality of the intervention
technologies.
Contrasting narrative resolution
An important feature of the typology is that regardless of
the clearly specified PRISM elements and the common
pre-trial training, guidance, and coaching by the PRISM
research team, the five types differ as to how their narra-
tive is resolved. Implementation of the intervention is not
an endpoint in itself.
One of the most striking contrasts is between the Against
the Odds Type and the Technologist Type. The Against the
Odds Type takes the narrative form of a tragedy [23]. It is
initially progressive. The practitioner is positive and hope-
ful in what can be achieved during implementation. This
is followed by a regressive slide as the desired ending slips
away from the practitioner's grasp [23]. The practitioner
in the Against the Odds Type is a 'tragic hero' whom we
understand to be great in their knowledge of the princi-
ples and logic of community development, someone who
mediates between us (the audience) and what could be
described as an 'invisible fate' [43]. In other words, as the
Against the Odds Type describes the obstacles and barriers
to intervention implementation, we are made aware of
possible intervention failure. In the following example, a
practitioner explains that difficulties with local manage-
ment shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a lack of success.
However, for the audience/reader one is left wondering
how a short (two-year) intervention can succeed amidst
such strong opposition.
'Actually I'd just like to say that I don't necessarily
judge what's happening with [manager] as .... unsuc-
cessful .... from a CD [community development] point
of view, that can be a symptom that you're actually
being quite effective and that you're pushing people's
buttons because when you create change, you do.'
(The Against the Odds Type: ten months into the inter-
vention)The Against the Odds Type comes to realize that their goal
to instil in others the knowledge of community develop-
ment was doomed from the beginning. The barriers were
too great, and this is how the narrative is resolved.
' [It] [h]as been a long haul and it seems to me that it's
really important from a CD perspective that when
change is being implemented that the people who
want the change ( i.e., in this case [municipal] council)
must be integrally involved in the process, at the coal
face .... it was quite obvious now, looking back, that
the changes PRISM wanted to focus on were so much
of a paradigm leap for the person allocated to support
the changes ( i.e., the provider [the Maternal and Child
Health Service]) that it would have made much more
sense strategically to have moved this role to someone
at [municipal] council .... I did suggest [this idea to the
PRISM research team] but [I] was supported to keep
trying with the [the prescribed PRISM approach].' (The
Against the Odds Type: twenty three months into the
intervention)
The Against the Odds Type resolves its narrative, without
reference to the objective evidence to be presented by the
trial team at a future date. This is in contrast to the Tech-
nologist Type for whom resolution is suspended until the
health outcomes are known. This is because the Technol-
ogist Type defers power to the technologies of the inter-
vention, including its outcome evaluation. For the
Technologist Type, personal goals or opinion are second-
ary. The following quotation from the final interview with
a practitioner is a good illustration of the separation of
practitioner with personal opinions, goals, and expecta-
tions and the intervention technologies.
Interviewer: 'And what about your expectations, as the
project worker?'
CDO: 'Expectations?'
Interviewer: 'Your expectations in the beginning about
what you were going to get out of it, and whether or
not they were met?'
CDO: [long pause] 'I don't know what I think I'd get
out of it personally.' (The Technologist Type: final
month of the intervention)
Discussion
The CDOs were employed for their community develop-
ment expertise, but they were placed within a project with
fixed goals and fixed intervention components. The ran-
domised trial design created a high stakes, highly scruti-
nized environment. So this is not a typology of unfettered
community development practice. But it is a common sce-
Implementation Science  2009, 4:80 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/80
Page 10 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)nario. Community development practitioners are often
employed on projects not where communities lead, but
where communities are invited to participate, collaborate,
and strengthen an approach conceived originally by exter-
nal researchers and/or funding agencies [47].
We believe CDOs gave us rich, authentic accounts of their
work, because the diaries were confidential and not read
by their managers (PRISM research team), and because
results were confirmed by CDOs and a range of commu-
nity practitioners in subsequent presentations and dia-
logues. We appreciate that in the early stages CDOs might
have been tempted to write what they supposed we might
like to hear. But to keep this going for two years would
have been difficult. Plus, if CDOs were writing what they
thought we wanted to hear, we would have expected more
consistency across the writers in keeping with the tradi-
tional view of what the intervention was supposed to be.
As it was, the practices described were diverse, in spite of
the intervention having a standard form.
It is not unusual to use narratives to understand and rep-
resent community development processes [48,49]. But
the extensiveness and intensiveness of this data set are
unique. Plus, the phenomenological approach to analysis
permitted a meta-synthesis with unique insights. So what
have we found, and what do we make of our findings?
Research in professional practice in medicine, nursing,
social work, education, and the arts has studied decision-
making [50], skill development [51], competence [52],
sense-making [53], and management of uncertainty [54].
Sheppard and Ryan [55], for example, describe how social
workers act as 'rule-using analysts' in everyday practice to
analyse patterns, form hypotheses, and revise actions.
Others have drawn attention to how both health profes-
sionals and practitioners in the creative arts use improvi-
sation as an essential form of action. Farmer [[56], p.1]
goes further to suggest that improvisation and theatre
form the central metaphor of community development
itself, arguing that community building is essentially
about 'putting people together to create new conversa-
tions, new alliances and new possibilities.'
This paper represents, to our knowledge, the first intensive
investigation of the role that community practitioners
themselves play. It is all the more important because com-
munity development practitioners typically eschew the
limelight. So anxious are they to see others take credit for
project success, they rarely describe or own their particular
contribution. In tracking and analyzing their narratives
over time, what emerged was a typology not of best prac-
tice necessarily, but of real practice, the positioning of
people and 'the stakes' among them. Later papers will elu-
cidate the types and their distinctions in more detail. But
it is important in the first instance to consider the overallstructure of the typology, its parameters, and what we feel
it offers.
Five criteria have been suggested to justify whether a
typology is adequate [57]. These five criteria are: Is the
phenomenon to be classified adequately specified? Is the
classification characteristic adequately specified? Are the
categories mutually exclusive? Is the typology collectively
exhaustive? And finally, is the typology useful?
The phenomenon we describe is the unfolding of a com-
munity intervention through the chief facilitator's
thoughts and actions. Our types are adequately specified
if they are specific and coherent on replication. To verify
this, we invite researchers in other contexts to embark on
similar inquiry and see if the five types emerge. In the
meantime, is it encouraging that the types encompass and
echo the power struggles and cultural complexities that
have been noted by others who have researched imple-
mentation processes [58] and those who have studied
change agents [59].
Adequate specification of the classification characteristic
refers to the columns in Table 1 and Table S1 (see Addi-
tional File 1; Table S1 - A typology of practice in commu-
nity level interventions). Do the types truly pivot around
these points? We acknowledge that researchers using
other theories, such as activity settings analysis [60],
would articulate practice in terms of roles, symbols, and
relationships interacting over time, for example. We have
been informed by this thinking and have already used the
same data set to identify episodes of practice that conform
with Kelly and Trickett's ecological theory [61]. But what
our typology uniquely adds, that replication could poten-
tially verify, is the overarching moral position and subjec-
tive meanings that provide the interpretative framework
for all action. The organising theme [34], the orientation
to practice, the narrative form [23], and the resolution
[42] especially show this. Practitioner values are rarely
incorporated into the frameworks used to interpret peo-
ple's work, let alone the dynamics of how interventions
unfold in communities.
Our categories do not set out to be mutually exclusive in
the sense that they are not people types, but practice types.
To test if the typology is collectively exhaustive, a replica-
tion study could test if other types, beyond our five,
emerge. However it is quite possible that different con-
texts, cultures, and times might nuance these practice
types differently. The value is therefore not simply in the
replication of the types per se , but in the cross-validation
by the practitioners themselves in the execution of the
final most important criterion [57] - the assessment of the
typology's usefulness.

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)The construction of archetypes has been used in other
fields, like management science, to examine simultaneous
associations among a large numbers of variables in order
to yield higher order patterns that can be used in planning
[62]. In the first instance, we suggest that the usefulness of
our typology lies in the invitation to reflect on aspects of
practice that might hitherto have been mostly unseen. Of
all, the Technologist Type narrative is possibly the most
familiar. This is because it is the one that many commu-
nity intervention researchers have constructed previously,
not with open qualitative methods as we have here, but
with alternative 'identity-kit' means such as process mon-
itoring tools and tracking devices closely tied with the
delivery of intervention components or other prescribed
specifications [41]. The Technologist Type is the one most
associated with intervention fidelity as defined in tradi-
tional ways ( i.e., conforming to a particular standardised
technology). Indeed, the remaining four types are perhaps
the worse nightmare of intervention researchers who
ascribe to a conventional view of intervention integrity.
The insights from the narrative analysis go beyond the
roles practitioners play as change agents, such as catalyst,
solution giver, process helper, or resource linker [63], to
reveal the deeper values guiding the way they make deci-
sions. The narrative types invite new considerations of
intervention dynamics, in particular the strengths and vul-
nerabilities of different ways of working. For example, the
Romantic Type invites designers of community interven-
tions to value and to harness the rich pre-existing relation-
ships in communities. The potential down side is that
preservation of relationships and upholding their devel-
opment will cause the Romantic Type to stall on project
deadlines and trade off on other priorities. The strength of
the Heroic Type is commitment, dedication, and personal
investment. The vulnerability is burnout and neglect to
build sufficient significant responsibility taking in others.
The strength of the Satirist Type is the acute insight and
macro-level analysis that foresees how events will unfold
before they happen. The vulnerability is disengagement
and the sense of not feeling sufficiently valued. Getting
the analysis correct may become more important than
making the intervention successful. The strength of the
Technologist Type is the adherence to the standard inter-
vention protocol and the assurance of intervention fidel-
ity traditionally associated with this. The vulnerability is
the reluctance to improvise and adapt in ways that could
strengthen intervention potency. The strength of the
Against the Odds Type is the energy and commitment to
'textbook' style community development principles. The
vulnerability is the possibility of scant allies on the
ground with the same commitment and worldview. If it
truly takes a village to raise a child, the task is very big
indeed.We see these types as products of the interaction of the
context, the past experience and expertise brought by the
CDOs, and the phases of action. So, we would be con-
cerned if the construction of practice types from carefully
observed experiences in community interventions was
used to privilege something intrapsychic, such as person-
ality theory, or worst, to suggest or assist those who might
think that screening and selection of staff become formu-
laic ( i.e., 'we'd like to recruit two Heroes Types, one
Romantic Type, and as many Technology Types as we can
get'). First, our types were rarely entirely embodied singly
within one person. Second, we do not know from this
analysis which type was associated with intervention suc-
cess (and the trial sample size precluded this degree of fine
discrimination being possible anyway).
To the practitioner, the value of the typology is the oppor-
tunity to own the personal in the professional, that is, to
interrogate one's own position at any particular time
point and either adjust it or embrace it consciously - to
articulate why he/she believes certain actions have more
benefits than others. Many of the types were susceptible to
disillusionment in this community intervention, with its
high expectations and uncertain, year-to-year funding. A
tool for reflection and action could help. To researchers
and theorists, the value of the typology is the acknowl-
edgement it gives to the neglected concept of agency in
community interventions, and to the diversity of agent
roles and positions. Our research has illuminated that the
agency exercised by practitioners forms five distinctive
patterns. Within these patterns there are smaller stories
about actions, strategies, causes, and purposes for doing
one thing and not another [18,61].
Paul Valery, the French philosopher and poet, argued that
'there is no theory that is not a fragment, carefully pre-
pared, of some autobiography' (Valery, cited in Olney,
1980)[64]. This statement was designed to draw attention
to the theorist in every theory. Here our focus on the per-
son is more flagrant. We have drawn on autobiographic
methods from social science to create a picture of what
happens in community intervention practice that is rarely
seen in the process methods, impact logs, outcome sur-
veys, and controlled designs that are usually constructed
in community intervention research [5]. Having 'outed'
this level of understanding and subjective meaning, the
full implications are still to be confronted. To truly make
complex interventions more successful, and to bridge the
policy and program effectiveness gaps so often lamented
[65], this new layer of meaning must be further explored.
Epilogue
The typology of practice was constructed prior to the
results of the PRISM intervention being made known to
the authors, the CDOs, or the public. A paper published

on maternal health at six months after birth. The results of
the follow-up two years after birth have not yet been pub-
lished and are unknown to the authors of this paper.
