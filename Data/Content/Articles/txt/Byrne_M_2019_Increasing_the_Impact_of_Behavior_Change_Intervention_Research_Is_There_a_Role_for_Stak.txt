Increasing the Impact of Behavior Change Intervention Research:
Is There a Role for Stakeholder Engagement?

Objective: There is powerful evidence that changing people’s health-related behavior can impact the
leading causes of mortality and morbidity. However, despite the significant potential to improvehealth and clinical outcomes, behavior change interventions frequently fall short of expected reachor impact. Method: Stakeholder engagement, which refers to the active involvement of public,
patients, health professionals, and other decision makers throughout the research process, has beenproposed as a strategy to improve the quality, reach, and impact of research. A user-centered“reverse translation” approach makes it more likely that behavior change interventions are relevantto users’ needs, better designed, more likely to be implemented, and, ultimately, more effective.Results: In this article, the key concepts of stakeholder engagement are introduced and critically
evaluated. Three studies, providing examples of stakeholder engagement, are described and criticallyevaluated. These include (1) a research prioritization project that sought the views of people withdiabetes, services providers, and policy makers to identify research priorities in behavioral diabetesresearch; (2) a “core outcome set” study, in which consensus methods were used to identifyoutcomes considered important by patients and health professionals for trials of interventionstargeting self-management among young adults with Type 1 diabetes; and (3) an interventiondevelopment study, where the intervention targeting self-management among young adults withType 1 diabetes was coproduced with input from members of a “young adult panel.” Conclusions:
While stakeholder engagement appears promising as a strategy to increase the impact of behaviorchange research, evidence is sparse and more guidance, tools, and training are needed.

Chronic noncommunicable diseases are now the leading causes
of mortality and morbidity ( Lozano et al., 2012 ). Changing human
behavior—including smoking, alcohol misuse, poor diet, and lackof physical activity—is key to improving global health and reduc-ing these diseases ( National Institute for Clinical Excellence,
2014 ). However, although research testing the effectiveness of
behavior change interventions frequently shows some promise, itoften falls short of expected reach or impact and regularly deliversinconsistent findings ( Fredrix, McSharry, Flannery, Dinneen, &
Byrne, 2018 ;Free et al., 2013 ;Gardner, Smith, Lorencatto, Hamer,
& Biddle, 2016 ;Maher et al., 2014 ;O’Hara, Hynes, O’Donnell,
Nery, et al., 2017 ). Similar limitations are evident within imple-
mentation research, which targets health professional behaviorchange with the aim of implementing new practices and/or change
existing practices within health services ( Atkins et al., 2017 ).
Reasons for these limitations in behavior change research
include: low investment in this area of research ( Michie, Fix-
sen, Grimshaw, & Eccles, 2009 ); poor-quality evaluation meth-
ods ( Gardner et al., 2016 ); lack of application of behavior
change theory in intervention development ( Michie, 2008 );
poor specification of intervention content ( Michie, Abraham, et
al., 2011 ); lack of large-scale, interdisciplinary team science in
health psychology ( Freedland, 2017 ); and other problems asso-
ciated with methodological challenges specific to the designand conduct of behavioral trials ( Byrne, McSharry, Meade,
Lavoie, & Bacon, 2018 ).
An additional possible reason for limited success is lack of
stakeholder engagement (SE) in behavior change research. SE inresearch refers to the involvement of public, patients, health pro-fessionals, service users, payers, and other decision makers, fromthe early stages of setting priorities and forming research questionsthrough to the final stages of implementing and disseminatingresults ( Concannon et al., 2015 ). Terminology used in this area is
diverse and can be confusing. The term SEwill be used in this
article as it is considered an umbrella term that encompasses

activities, including patient and public involvement (PPI) and
patient engagement. The U.K. National Institute of Health Re-search, which supports the INVOLVE program to support activepublic involvement in health and social care research, definesinvolvement as research being carried out “with” or “by” membersof the public, rather than “to,” “about,” or “for” them ( INVOLVE,
2012 ).
SE has become more common in the past decade and is now
considered best practice in health research. Indeed, it is a require-ment for many research funders internationally ( Absolom, Holch,
Woroncow, Wright, & Velikova, 2015 ). The increase in SE is
driven by the belief that greater engagement will enhance thequality, relevance, and acceptability of research to all stakeholders(Staniszewska & Denegri, 2013 ).
Advocates of SE claim that it can improve research quality by
ensuring that research is more relevant to research end users’needs. SE enables researchers to identify and conduct research inareas considered priority by stakeholders ( Gray-Burrows et al.,
2018 ), identify intervention outcomes that are considered impor-
tant by stakeholders ( Staniszewska, Haywood, Brett, & Tutton,
2012 ), design interventions and research materials that are appro-
priate and sensitive to stakeholders’ needs ( Brett et al., 2014 ), and
recruit more successfully into research studies and disseminateresearch findings more effectively ( Brett et al., 2014 ). In addition,
some have argued that the public has a right to be involved in theconduct, management, and governance of publicly funded researchto ensure public accountability and safeguarding ( Gray-Burrows et
al., 2018 ).
Conducting large and expensive randomized controlled trials of
interventions with inadequate SE increases the chances of contrib-uting to the significant societal problem of research waste. In 2010,expenditure on life sciences (mostly biomedical) research wasU.S.$240 billion ( Røttingen et al., 2013 ). Waste across medical
research (clinical or other types) has been estimated as consuming85% of the billions spent each year ( Macleod et al., 2014 ), and
commentators have criticized clinical research suggesting thatmost research is not useful ( Ioannidis, 2016 ).
For example, in the Stanford Girl’s Health Enrichment Multisite
Studies, researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial of aculturally tailored afterschool dance program intervention to re-duce excessive weight gain in African American girls aged 8–10years ( Robinson et al., 2010 ). No difference in body mass index
trajectories across the 2-year study was found between interven-tion and control group participants. The research team accountedfor this finding by pointing to an “implementation failure” withinthe study: Median attendance rates among intervention participantsat dance classes were only 12%, one fifth of the goal rate. If thisstudy had used SE during the development of the intervention, it isunlikely that the research team would have developed an interven-tion that appears to have had so little traction with the targetpopulation and they could have avoided the waste of a full-scalerandomized controlled trial costing millions of dollars and signif-icant effort on the part of the researchers and participants.
In this article, I will present three examples of efforts I have led
or been involved in to use SE to improve the quality of thebehavior change research conducted within the Health BehaviorChange Research Group. This group is a Health Research Board(Ireland)–funded national hub and internationally recognized cen-ter of excellence in health behavioral intervention development,evaluation, and implementation in Ireland. The first example is a
research prioritization project in which we worked with key stake-holders to identify, and achieve consensus on, the most importanttarget behaviors for research in diabetes in Ireland. The secondexample is an international, e-Delphi consensus study to identify acore outcome set (COS) that key stakeholders (young adults withType 1 diabetes [T1D], diabetes health professionals, diabetesresearchers, and diabetes policy makers) consider as essentialoutcomes for future intervention research. The third example de-scribes how we have embedded a user-centered approach in thedevelopment of a complex behavior change intervention to im-prove outcomes for young adults living with T1D, the D1 NowStudy. For each example, I will reflect on the experience of usingSE and highlight any lessons learnt. I will conclude by evaluatingthe current evidence base for the value and impact of SE and offerguidance for future attempts to embed SE in behavior changeresearch based on the state of the evidence and my own experi-ences.
Example 1: Prioritizing Target Behaviors for Research
in Diabetes: Using the Nominal Group Technique to
Achieve Consensus From Key Stakeholders
At the outset of a 5-year program of research, which aimed to
promote the routine application of behavioral science to the de-velopment and evaluation of behavioral interventions in popula-tion health and health services research, the research group neededto decide which patient, public, and health professional behaviorsrelevant to prevention and management of diabetes should beprioritized. Previous work has highlighted the lack of stakeholderand diabetes community links as key barriers in the implemen-tation of diabetes research ( Garcia de Quevedo, Siminerio,
L’Heveder, & Narayan, 2012 ). Engaging stakeholders in the re-
search process, by seeking input from patients and health careprofessionals in the prioritization of research, is recommended(Petit-Zeman, Firkins, & Scadding, 2010 ). We aimed to work with
key stakeholders to identify, and achieve consensus on, the mostimportant target behaviors for research in diabetes in Ireland anddevelop a research agenda for the research group ( McSharry,
Fredrix, Hynes, & Byrne, 2016 ). By adopting this collaborative
approach to coproducing a research agenda, we sought not only toidentify important research topics but also to enhance partnershipsbetween researchers and key stakeholders to accelerate translationof research into benefits for patients and the population.
Methods have been reported in detail elsewhere ( McSharry et
al., 2016 ). Briefly, 24 participants, including people with diabetes,
diabetes health care professionals, and policy makers, took part ina nominal group technique consensus process. Participants gener-ated lists, through an online survey, of important target behaviorsin three areas: managing T1D, managing Type 2 diabetes (T2D),and preventing T2D. Participants then attended a research priori-tization meeting and ranked target behaviors in two rounds, withgroup discussion between ranking rounds. For each of the threekey areas, the six top-ranked behaviors relevant to people withdiabetes and health care professionals were identified. The topbehavior relevant to people with T1D was “taking insulin asrequired” and for people with T2D was “attending and engagingwith structured education programs.” “Engage in collaborativegoal setting with patients” was the top-ranked behavior relevant toThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

health care professionals for managing both T1D and T2D. For
preventing T2D, “engage in healthy behaviors as a family” was thehighest ranked population behavior and “attend and engage withbehavior change training” was the highest ranked professionalbehavior.
It proved possible to work with a diverse group of stakeholders
to inform the diabetes research agenda for our research group.Following this process, we have developed programs of research intwo priority areas: first, research to increase attendance at struc-tured education in T2D ( Humphreys, McSharry, Dinneen, & By-
rne, 2017 ) and, second, research to explore the implementation
and effectiveness of goal-setting techniques in diabetes self-management interventions ( Fredrix et al., 2018 ). By adopting a
collaborative approach to the coproduction of the research agenda,our experience was that the relationships developed through thisprocess significantly facilitated the conduct of the program ofresearch, made it easier to recruit participants, and increasedstakeholders’ interest in the work. By identifying a key nationalpriority, as was the case for increasing attendance at structurededucation for people with T2D, the research team was able tobenefit from new national initiatives and investments in this area.For example, a national structured patient education coordinatorwas appointed soon after the research prioritization exercise wasconducted, and this person (who was one of the participants in theresearch prioritization!) has been instrumental in facilitating accessand recruitment of participants for this research. Practice andpolicy stakeholders were keen to access, disseminate, and use theresults of the research, increasing the chances that the researchfindings will impact practice.
The process was not without its problems, however. It was
challenging to facilitate the discussions among the key stakehold-ers in the research prioritization meeting. People with diabetes inthe study were recruited via Diabetes Ireland, an Irish nationalcharity dedicated to supporting people with diabetes. Participants,once recruited, were contacted by the researcher by phone inadvance of attending the research prioritization meeting. Theywere provided information about the research and had an oppor-tunity to ask questions. However, the diversity of backgrounds andwide range of expertise within the group made discussions chal-lenging to moderate. People with diabetes contributed less to themeeting than members of other stakeholder groups, and two of thepatient participants, in feedback following the meeting, stated thatthey felt they had not been adequately prepared and had not knownwhat to expect. It is important that patient representatives withinthe research process, who have little or no background to researchand the types of activities involved in the research process, aresupported and provided with training to ensure that they have theskills needed to participate fully ( INVOLVE, 2009 ). In addition,
skill and training are needed for facilitators of discussions aboutresearch prioritization, and facilitators must be able to unite dif-ferent groups, translating between different languages or spheresof expertise and enabling interactions ( Cartwright & Crowe,
2011 ).
Another challenge for the research group was around maintain-
ing networks and engagement of key stakeholders in the programof research beyond the research prioritization exercise. This ap-pears to be a common pattern: Stakeholders, if they are engaged atall, are more frequently engaged in the earlier stages of researchwhen priorities are set and evidence is generated ( Concannon etal., 2015 ). Research teams should seek to establish formal struc-
tures to maintain engagement throughout the research process andmaintain interest and contact by regularly updating stakeholdersabout activities and outputs from the program of research, forexample, by regular dissemination of policy briefs ( INVOLVE,
2009 ).
Example 2: A Core Outcomes Set for Clinical Trials
of Interventions for Young Adults With T1D:
An International, Multiperspective Delphi
Consensus Study
T1D requires people with the condition to engage in a complex
regimen of self-management, including intensive self-monitoringof blood glucose and administering insulin, as well as regulatingdiet and exercise, to maintain optimal glycemic control ( Chiang,
Kirkman, Laffel, Peters, & the Type 1 Diabetes Sourcebook Au-thors, 2014 ). Young adults, aged 15–30 years, in particular strug-
gle with the demands of self-management and are identified asbeing at high risk of clinical complications as a result ( Bryden,
Dunger, Mayou, Peveler, & Neil, 2003 ). One problem with re-
search seeking to identify effective interventions to improve self-management among this high-risk population is the heterogeneityof outcomes used ( O’Hara, Hynes, O’Donnell, Nery, et al., 2017 ).
In addition, intervention research frequently does not include out-comes that are considered most important to people living with thecondition and professionals making decisions about health care,limiting the relevance and applicability of research ( Williamson et
al., 2012 ). To address these problems, trialists advocate the iden-
tification of COS, defined as agreed standardized collections ofoutcomes that should be measured and reported in all trials, forspecific clinical areas ( Clarke, 2007 ). These outcomes constitute a
minimum set of outcomes, which are recommended for inclusion in
all intervention trials in the relevant clinical area. The involvementof key stakeholders in the identification of a COS is consideredcritical to ensure that outcomes are relevant to all stakeholdergroups ( Williamson et al., 2012 ). Our aim was to identify a COS
for intervention research aiming to improve clinical, behavioral, orpsychosocial outcomes for young adults with T1D ( Byrne et al.,
2017 ).
Methods have been reported in detail elsewhere ( Byrne et al.,
2017 ) and followed recently published guidelines on conduct of
COS studies ( Kirkham et al., 2016 ). Briefly, using a list of 87
outcomes generated from a previously published systematic re-view ( O’Hara, Hynes, O’Donnell, Nery, et al., 2017 ), we admin-
istered two online surveys to a sample of international key stake-holders (Survey 1, n/H11005132, and Survey 2, n/H1100581) who rated the
importance of the outcomes on a 9-point Likert scale. Participantsincluded young adults with T1D, diabetes health professionals,diabetes researchers, and policy makers in diabetes services whowere recruited by the international research team distributing thestudy invite via e-mail to lists and networks within their countriesand internationally. In Survey 2, which was administered only tothose who had completed Survey 1, participants received informa-tion on total mean rating for each outcome and a reminder of theirpersonal outcome ratings from Survey 1. They were asked tocomplete Survey 2, taking this information into account. Survey 2results were discussed at a consensus meeting and participants(n/H1100512: three young adults with T1D, four diabetes healthThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

professionals, four diabetes researchers, and one diabetes policy
maker) voted on outcomes. Final core outcomes were includedprovided that 70% of consensus group participants voted for theirinclusion. Eight core outcomes were agreed for inclusion in thefinal COS: measures of diabetes-related stress, diabetes-related
quality of life, number of severe hypoglycemic events, self-management behavior, number of instances of diabetic ketoac-idosis, objectively measured glycated hemoglobin, level ofclinic engagement, and perceived level of control over diabetes.
It was possible to engage a diverse range of stakeholders to
produce and agree a COS for research targeting young adults withT1D. Diabetes research tends to emphasize quantifiable biomedi-cal outcomes (such as standard metrics related to survival andphysiological outcomes) over patient-oriented outcomes (out-comes that are important to patients such as quality of life; Hurley
et al., 2017 ). It is likely that the inclusion of a broad range of
stakeholders contributed to the production of a COS, which in-cluded a diverse set of outcomes, including stress, quality of life,self-management behavior, and level of engagement with healthservices, in addition to the “traditional” medical or biologicalmarkers. Within the discussions during the consensus meeting,young adults with T1D strongly advocated for the importance ofpsychosocial outcomes relative to clinical outcomes.
While consensus methods have been criticized ( Beretta, 1996 )
and the study had some limitations ( Byrne et al., 2017 ), we have
produced the first COS for intervention trials targeting youngadults with T1D. In addition, we believe that the process of patientinvolvement in this study worked well, and the interactions duringthe consensus meeting were more successful than those during themeeting in the research prioritization study described above. Mem-bers of a young adult panel (YAP) of 18- to 30-year-olds with T1Dthat had been formed for another study ( O’Hara, Cunningham, et
al., 2017 ) worked with the COS study research team to ensure that the
surveys were acceptable to younger adults and to disseminate thesurveys using methods, such as social media, which increased thechances of the surveys reaching young adults. Members of the YAPparticipated in the consensus meeting and, as they had receivedresearch and communications training as part of the YAP formationprocess, demonstrated the skills and confidence to fully engage withthe discussion within the consensus meeting.
Example 3: Developing and Engaging a Young Adult
Patient and Public Involvement Panel to Develop a
Health Behavior Change Intervention: The D1
Now Study
As described above, young adults with T1D often struggle with
the demands of self-management of their condition and are iden-tified as being at high risk of clinical complications as a result.Evidence is lacking around effective interventions for this popu-lation ( O’Hara, Hynes, O’Donnell, Nery, et al., 2017 ). The impor-
tance of including key stakeholders, such as patients and membersof the public, to create and implement high-quality, impactfulinterventions has been highlighted ( Armstrong, Herbert, Aveling,
Dixon-Woods, & Martin, 2013 ). Our aim was to develop the D1
Now intervention, which aims to improve outcomes for youngadults living with T1D. The research was underpinned by a com-prehensive approach to SE while synthesizing theoretical and bestpractice guidelines for intervention development ( Craig et al.,2008 ;Michie, Atkins, & West, 2014 ). We involved research
users—young adults with T1D, service providers, and policy mak-ers—in a systematic and meaningful way to increase the likelihoodof developing a feasible, implementable, applicable, and effectiveintervention.
Methods have been reported in detail elsewhere ( O’Hara, Cun-
ningham, et al., 2017 ;Walsh et al., 2018 ). Briefly, we recruited
young adults to join a Young Adult Panel (YAP) in the studythrough a multimedia campaign. A public consultation event wasorganized to generate interest in the research, and interested youngadults were interviewed to determine their suitability to join theYAP. A panel of eight members was selected, and members weretrained in committee skills and an introduction to different re-search methods and terms. The YAP members participated in allstages of the research process: They were members of the researchstudy steering group and attended research meetings, developedresearch materials, reviewed and interpreted research findings,were involved in result dissemination, and helped develop theonline platform within the intervention to enhance engagementbetween young adults and their diabetes health care providers.Members of the YAP assisted in the interpretation of results of asystematic review of interventions targeting young adults ( O’Hara,
Hynes, O’Donnell, Nery, Byrne, et al., 2017 ). For the qualitative
study to understand young adults’ diabetes self-management be-havior, YAP members coproduced interviews and focus groupscripts. They co-led an international conference on health servicesdelivery for young adults with T1D and participated in an expertpanel consensus meeting to refine the intervention content(O’Hara, Hynes, O’Donnell, Keighron, et al., 2017 ). They wrote
specific sections of a further research grant application (which wassuccessful) to pilot test the D1 Now intervention.
We are currently pilot testing the D1 Now intervention, which
includes three primary components: an interactive online system tofacilitate more flexible appointment booking and communicationbetween service users and providers, a “key worker” role identifiedwithin the diabetes service to promote better relationships andgreater continuity between services users and providers, and anagenda-setting tool to promote greater shared decision making.
We engaged meaningfully with a range of stakeholders, includ-
ing young adults with T1D, service providers, and policy makersfor T1D, in order to increase the likelihood of developing afeasible, implementable, and effective intervention. The SE ap-proach was instrumental in moving from theory-based conceptsidentified through the systematic review of the evidence ( O’Hara,
Hynes, O’Donnell, Nery, et al., 2017 ) and the qualitative research
to operationalizing core intervention components. In our experi-ence, integrating a SE approach into a phased intervention devel-opment approach ( Craig et al., 2008 ) to identify evidence-based,
acceptable, and feasible ways of operationalizing theoretical con-structs that we identified using the Behavior Change Wheel frame-work for intervention development ( Michie, van Stralen, & West,
2011 ) was critical to delivering the final product: the D1 Now
intervention.
The SE approach within this study was not without challenges,
however. Forming the YAP was time-intensive and required com-mitment from the research team to drive recruitment and maintainrelationships. Meetings with the YAP often took place out of officehours, so flexibility was needed from the research team. It waschallenging to identify training content suitable for the YAP mem-This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

bers in the absence of guidance in this area. Acting as a member
of the YAP was also demanding and required regular meetings andexposure to new ideas, skills, and language. YAP members wererequired to read different and unfamiliar types of material (partic-ipant information sheets, grant applications, and articles beingprepared for publication). Delivering research impact into servicescan be a slow process, and YAP members were required to engage
with an iterative research process over a period of 2 years,which at times may have seemed frustrating. This involvedmanaging expectations of both the YAP and the research teamin terms of what was feasible, and implementable, and beingrealistic about how quickly change can happen given researchdesigns and processes. We benefited greatly from support by aneutral local “knowledge broker,” Jigsaw, a community youthmental health service with experience in young adult panels(Illback et al., 2010 ). The process of understanding and inte-
grating the ethos of SE, or patient and public involvement,occurred gradually over the duration of the study, and trustbetween the research team and the YAP grew through multipleinteractions. Inclusion of opportunities to support the develop-ment of relationships in informal contexts, such as travelingtogether to meetings or having lunch following meetings, can beuseful in enhancing the quality of stakeholder and research teamrelationships ( Armstrong et al., 2013 ).
Some key lessons for researchers who wish to engage stake-
holders in their research are listed as follows:
 Engage key stakeholders early in the research process to
enhance the likelihood of impact. This enhances stake-holders’ feelings of ownership of, responsibility for, andinterest in the program of research.
 Research teams can maintain SE throughout the research
process by regularly updating stakeholders on progress,for example, by dissemination of policy briefs.
 It takes time to build trust and relationships between mem-
bers of the research team and other key stakeholders. Whenplanning research meetings, it can help to build in time tofacilitate informal interactions to develop relationships; forexample, it may be possible to travel to meetings together ororganize a shared lunch before or after meetings.
 Stakeholder engagement requires commitment from all
members of the research team, as well as flexibility, asmeetings may have to take place outside of normal “officehours.”
 Stakeholders, especially patient and public members, should
have protected time within research meetings where theirviews are sought, as they may not be confident enough tointerrupt other speakers to volunteer their views.
 Abbreviations and technical language should be avoided as
much as possible within research meetings involving stake-holders, as these can be off-putting and can act as barriers toengagement.
 Patients and public within the research process, who have
little or no background to research and the types of activitiesinvolved in the research process, should be trained in relevantresearch and committee skills to enable them to participatefully and conduct the tasks. Researchers also may need communication training to facil-
itate interactions and discussions between teams of peoplefrom mixed backgrounds.
Discussion
So, does SE increase the impact of behavior change intervention
research? The answer is probably yes, but the evidence base is stillunderdeveloped ( Brett et al., 2014 ;Domecq et al., 2014 ;Shippee
et al., 2015 ).
Public and patient SE in research seems feasible across a wide
range of settings ( Domecq et al., 2014 ). Based on evidence re-
viewed by INVOLVE in the United Kingdom, public involvementin research positively impacts the quality of the research, as wellas impacting members of the public who are involved in research,the researchers themselves, and members of the wider community(INVOLVE, 2009 ). Public involvement in research has been re-
ported as leading to improvements in the research, for example, inthe research question, study design, communication with potentialparticipants, study recruitment, confidence to carry out or com-plete a study, interpretation and communication of results, andinfluence on future research ( South et al., 2016 ). In a systematic
review of the impact of PPI on the impact of health and social careresearch, PPI was associated with enhanced quality and appropri-ateness of research, with impacts reported at all stages of research(Brett et al., 2014 ). Researchers who adopt PPI in their research
report the benefits of doing so ( Vale, Thompson, Murphy, Forcat,
& Hanley, 2012 ).
Guidance in how to do stakeholder-engaged research is sparse.
Training and user-friendly tools and methods for stakeholder re-cruitment, engagement, and evaluation are needed to help re-searchers embrace SE in their research projects ( Concannon et al.,
2014 ).
Critical factors to ensure success include long-term involvement
of stakeholders, involvement throughout the duration of a project,and adequate training and support for the people involved ( IN-
VOLVE, 2009 ). To effectively engage patients in the research
process, it is essential to ensure early involvement (ideally at theprotocol-design stage), establish effective communication chan-nels between patients and other team members (e.g., creatingopportunities for more informal discussion outside of meetingtimes), and promote a nonhierarchical structure by valuing eachteam member’s opinions ( Armstrong et al., 2013 ). Researchers are
advised to consider a broad range of approaches to PPI and selecttheir approach according to the desired impact and the people theywish to engage ( South et al., 2016 ). The need to tailor PPI
activities according to the nature of research to ensure authenticand appropriate involvement is important. A framework to guidethe planning, conduct, and reporting of PPI within implementationresearch, which generally focuses on health professional behavior,has been recently published ( Gray-Burrows et al., 2018 ).
This article aims to share and learn from the experience of
adopting a SE approach across a number of studies within aprogram of behavior change intervention research. However, noneof the studies actually set out to experimentally testthe impact of
SE. Within this article, I have presented our experience of usingthese approaches; future research is needed to develop a solidevidence base for the impact of SE ( Shippee et al., 2015 ) and to
estimate where engagement and involvement have the greatestThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

impact. Research devoted to identifying the best methods to
achieve engagement is absent and needed ( Domecq et al., 2014 ).
Tools have been developed to encourage more standardized re-porting on collaboration with stakeholders, and research teams areencouraged to conduct additional research to evaluate the impact
of engagement on the relevance, transparency, and adoption ofresearch ( Concannon et al., 2015 ).
