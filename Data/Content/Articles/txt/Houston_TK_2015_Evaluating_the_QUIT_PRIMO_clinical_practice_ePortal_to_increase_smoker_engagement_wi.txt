Abstract
Background: Effective web-assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs) have been underutilized by smokers; moreover,
despite practice guideline recommendations, clinical teams do not routinely refer smokers to WATIs. Our goal was to
test a clinical practice innovation, an ePortal designed to change practice and patient behavior. Our hypotheses were
that the integrated system would result in increased smoker referrals, with an automated follow-up system resulting in
more smoker registrations and finally augmentations of the WATI would result in more smokers quitting at 6 months.
Methods: Practice ePortal Implementation Trial : Practices ( n= 174) were randomized to an online practice ePortal with
an “e-referral tool ”to the WATI (e-referred smokers received automated email reminders from the practice) and with
practice feedback reports with patient tracking and practice-to-patient secure messaging versus comparison (a paper
“referral prescription ”). Implementation success was measured by the number of smokers referred and smokers
registering.
Clinical Effectiveness Trial : To estimate the effectiveness of the WATI components on 6-month smoking cessation,
registered smokers were randomized into three groups: a state-of-the-art tailored WATI control [control], the WATI
enhanced with proactive, pushed tailored email motivational messaging (messaging), and the WATI with messaging
further enhanced with personal secure messaging with a tobacco treatment specialist and an online support group
(personalized).
Results: Practice ePortal Trial results : A total of 4789 smokers were referred. The mean smokers referred per practice was
not statistically different by group (ePortal 24.89 (SD 22.29) versus comparison 30.15 (SD 25.45), p= 0.15). The e-referral
portal implementation program resulted in nearly triple t he rate of smoker registration (31 % of all smokers referred
registered online) versus comparison (11 %, p< 0.001).
Clinical Effectiveness Trial results : Active smokers randomized to the personalized group had a 6-month cessation rate of
25.2 %, compared with the messaging group (26.7 %) and the c ontrol (17 %). Next, when using an inverse probability
weighted selection model to account for attrition, those randomized to the two groups that received motivational
messaging (messaging or personalized) were mo re likely to quit than those in the control ( p= 0.04).

Conclusions: Among all smokers referred, the e-referral resulted in nearly threefold greater registrants (31 %) than paper
(11 %). The practice ePortal smokers receive d multiple reminders (increasing registr ation opportunities), and the practices
could track patient progress. The result was more smokers regis tering and, thus, more cessati on opportunities. Combining
the proactive referral and the WATI resulte d in higher rates of smoking cessation.

Introduction
Clinical practices have embraced routine screening for to-
bacco use, [1, 2] brief advice to quit is becoming universal,
[3, 4] and pharmaceutical treatments are increasing. In
addition to medications and nicotine replacement therapy,
behavioral support for quitting is recommended, and clin-
ical practice guidelines recommend practices that refer pa-
tients to publicly available resources including telephone
quit-lines and web-assisted tobacco interventions [5].
However, clinicians infrequently refer smokers to publicly
available resources including web-assisted tobacco inter-
ventions (WATIs) [6, 7].
Practice barriers to referral include limited time and
competing demands, [8] lack of a champion, staff train-
ing, as well as motivation [9]. Most WATIs have not
been engineered to connect with clinical practices or
provide post-referral feedback on their patients ’progress
online. Innovative implementation trials are needed to
demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated clinical and
technology-assisted tobacco interventions [6, 10]. As de-
fined by Curran et al., hybrid type 2 trials include dual
testing of the implementation (practice ePortal interven-
tion) and the clinical intervention (the WATI in this
study) [11]. These hybrid implementation-effectiveness
studies are appropriate (1) when there has been gather-
ing evidence for clinical efficacy (creating “implementa-
tion momentum ”), but further detailed effectiveness
evidence is needed, and (2) when an implementation
strategy addressing barriers to implementing the clinical
intervention (the WATI) has not been fully tested in a
real-world practice setting.
Questions remain about how to best help clinical prac-
tices help their smokers avail themselves of technology-
assisted interventions, such as WATIs. Paper-referral
“information prescriptions, ”brochures with information
about web services, have been recommended to encour-
age patients to use online resources such as Medline
Plus [12] with limited evidence to support implementa-
tion. These information prescription brochures are a
relatively passive form of recruitment and may be for-
gotten when the patient returns to their home. Our prior
work [13, 14] has demonstrated the potential of anePortal with an e-referral tool that creates automated re-
minders to patients, sent by email, with personal advice
from their physician encouraging use of the WATI.
These “e-referrals ”represent a more active referral, a
sort of warm handoff of the smoker from the clinical
practice to the automated WATI. The ePortal innovation
also includes tools designed to provide positive feedback
to practices —practices can track registration and cessa-
tion progress of their patients and send individual
doctor-to-patient secure messages to encourage partici-
pation. In pilot tests, clinical practices ( n= 6) assisted in
improving the portal interface [9]. The providers liked
the simplicity and ease of the referral process, including
the system that automatically emailed patients to remind
them to visit the site. The providers were enthusiastic
about the practice reports, expressing that the nation-
wide comparison of referrals per practice and the track-
ing of their patient panel could serve as motivation to
improve. The providers were enthusiastic about the po-
tential of secure messaging to engage patients in their
own care but provided several recommendations for im-
provement and noted potential barriers and facilitators
(Table 1). However, testing the ePortal concept in a large
implementation trial has not yet been reported.
Currently, the public health potential impact of the
W A T I sh a sn o tb e e nr e c o g n i z e dd u et ol i m i t e dp a r -
ticipation by smokers, [15] in part related to the chal-
lenges of clinical practice implementation of referrals
and integration of the WATI in clinical care. We de-
signed an implementation program to support ePortal
implementation in clinical practices. Although chal-
lenging, trials ’testing implementation success and
clinical effectiveness are increasingly valued in imple-
mentation science as many of our clinical interven-
tions are both guidelines recommended and in need
of further effectiveness data. Thus, in the “Quality
Improvement in Tobacco-Provider Referrals and
Internet-Delivered Microsystem Optimization (QUIT-
PRIMO) ”trial [14, 16], we randomized 174 US
community-based primary care practices and now re-
port the implementation success of the ePortal at the
practice level and the subsequent effect of the WATIHouston et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:154 Page 2 of 16
on 6-month point prevalence abstinence at the
patient level.
As conceptualized, the integrated intervention is de-
signed to have a sequence of effects on the process of
care within each clinic, with the potential to influence
provider behavior (nurses a nd physicians), processes
of care, and patient behavior. Thus, we have designed
our main evaluation to assess key areas of influence,
which we have abbreviated as Refer-Go-Quit. At the
practice level, we hypothesize that more patients will
be referred with the ePortal (hypothesis 1: Refer) and
that the proportion of referred patients who go to the
WATI due to the ePortal will be greater compared
with a paper-referral control (hypothesis 2: Go).
Among the patients registered, the proportion of
smokers who quit at 6 months will be greater among
those in an augmented WATI, compared with a
standard interactive WATI (hypothesis 3). As de-
scribed, we augmented a standard WATI with pro-
active motivational messages (messaging arm) and
with personalized access to a tobacco treatment spe-
cialist and online support group (personalized arm).
Below, we detail the methods of the practice-level im-
plementation study (trial 1) and the patient-level be-
havior change intervention (trial 2).Methods
We conducted a hybrid type 2 implementation randomized
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00797628) with two levels of
randomization. Effectiveness evidence for the WATI is in-
creasing [11, 14 –16]. Common tools for smokers include
tailored motivational materials and interactive decision aids,
assessing perceived barriers and benefits and providing
feedback. Although referral to the WATI is recommended
in the current practice guidelines for smoking cessation,
more clinical effectiveness d ata is needed, especially com-
paring individual components of effective interventions. A
recent Cochrane review of WATIs found considerable het-
erogeneity of effect. We specifically are measuring both the
relative implementation succes s of two practice-level imple-
mentation strategies (a paper referral versus a practice por-
tal with e-referral) and the comparative effectiveness of
varying intensities of the patient WATI [17]. The trial
protocol was published in Implementation Science ,a n d
pilot testing of the ePortal has also been published [14, 16].
In overview, we first randomized 174 community-
based practices; half of the practices (the comparison)
implemented paper referrals to encourage patient WATI
use, and the other half (the practice intervention) used
an innovative online practice ePortal with an “e-referral
tool”to the WATI (e-referred smokers received emailsTable 1 Implementation facilitators and barriers, with resolution to barriers

encouraging them to register). To test the comparative
effectiveness of WATI features, we then randomized the
registered smokers to receive standard or enhanced fea-
tures (Fig. 1). In addition to the screenshots of the inter-
ventions included in the Additional files, we have also
provided brief mpeg movies as Additional files 2 and 4
so that readers can best understand the practice and pa-
tient web systems. To best appreciate the facets of the
two trials, we report the methods of the practice imple-
mentation trial and analyses and the patient effectiveness
trial and analyses separately and follow with the results.
Trial 1: clinical practice ePortal implementation
methods
As discussed, the primary research aim for trial 1 was to
measure rates of smoker referral and rates of smoker
registration, comparing the ePortal and paper-referralimplementation strategies. We hypothesize that more
patients will be referred with the ePortal (hypothesis 1:
Refer) and that the proportion of referred patients who
go to the WATI due to the ePortal will be greater com-
pared with a paper-referral control (hypothesis 2: Go).
Practice randomization began in June 2011. Practices
were randomized at the practice level to paper referral
or to the practice ePortal with e-referrals. Allocation was
generated from a prepared randomization table (a
randomization table with blocks of 10) and was auto-
mated by the system during the registration of the first
provider at the practice. All others who registered from
that practice were then randomized to the same arm
(paper or e-referrals). We followed practices for
6 months from their initial contact. The study was ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Board, and the proto-
col was overseen by a data safety and monitoring board.

Setting (clinical practices)
Community-based (non-university) US general, family,
or internal medicine practices were eligible. We used a
mailing list of practices and recruited until we achieved
174 practices. Practices implementing the paper- or e-
referral implementation strategies chose which smokers
to refer. During training, the practices were encouraged
to refer smokers regardless of whether they were ready
to quit smoking. All smokers in these practices were eli-
gible for referral. Using intent to treat, all active smokers
who registered (including online consent procedure)
were included in a 6-month follow-up, regardless of the
level of activity on the WATI.
Practice-level comparison versus ePortal practice
intervention
Paper referrals
Paper-referral practices were provided preprinted pads
of“information prescriptions ”with their office informa-
tion, a space for the provider to sign, and the WATI for
smokers website address (www.decide2quit.org [D2Q])
[16]. The paper referrals were provided to patients dur-
ing their visit.
Practice intervention: practice ePortal with e-referrals,
feedback, patient tracking, and messaging
Practices in the ePortal arm were also provided the
paper “information prescriptions ”to facilitate conver-
sations with patients, but further had access to our
practice ePortal (see screenshots in Additional file 1
and accompanying video, Additional file 2 —entitled
“ReferaSmoker.org ”). The core feature of the practice
portal was a secure user-friendly form where pro-
viders could refer smokers to D2Q by entering their
email addresses [9, 16, 18]. The e-referral created an
identity link (patient email) with D2Q, to send re-
minders of the referral, and also created a practice
link, connecting patient and practice. After e-referral,
the smokers received up to 10 reminder emails en-
couraging D2Q registration. Within the practice e-
referral portal, the practice link allowed us to provide
clinical practices with real-time dashboard monitoring
about their practice ’ss m o k e r s ’registration and pro-
gress in the WATI. Each time a registered smoker
logged in, the WATI collected the smokers ’quit sta-
tus which was then fed back to the clinical practice
dashboard. Through the ePortal, practices could also
send additional personalized motivational messages to
their patients. The practice ePortal also provided each
practice with performance feedback reports, compar-
ing the number of referrals in their practices with all
participating e-referring practices.Implementation facilitation in both comparison and
intervention practices
Published in detail elsewhere, [14] a facilitation-based
program, guided by the Promoting Action on Research
Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) frame-
work, was instituted to support implementation referrals
in both the paper and practice portal arms. PARIHS pro-
vides a conceptual framework that incorporates various
influences that interact within implementation. When
used as a guiding framework, PARIHS can highlight im-
portant evidence and contextual factors that may influ-
ence an implementation effort and can inform the
development of a suitable facilitation-based implementa-
tion strategy.
Our facilitation program included individualized tele-
phone/Internet trainings using an academic detailing ap-
proach. In our pilot test, staff turnover was identified as
a challenge to sustained implementation, so each prac-
tice was asked to identify two implementation coordina-
tors (physicians, nurses, or other staff). These two
implementation coordinators acted as points of contact
and champions. They were trained in the referral inter-
vention and acted as train-the-trainers providing infor-
mation to the rest of the practice and encouraging
adoption. Training was tailored to randomization arm
(with paper-referral practices being trained on the paper
referral only and provided an overview of the Decide2-
Quit.org WATI). For clinical teams randomized to the
practice portal, training included hands-on demonstra-
tions of the ReferASmoker.org website, including initial
registration, practice e-referring a “test”smoker, and ex-
ploring Decide2Quit.org. As reminders, for both arms, a
series of four motivational booster emails were sent over
a 6-week period. For ongoing facilitation, our study team
completed a total of six proactive booster facilitation
calls (approximately 15 –30 min) assessing perceived bar-
riers, strategizing solutions, and reinforcing success.
Table 1 outlines our changes based on our feedback to
facilitate the implementation of the referral.
Our implementation was designed to have several
pragmatic aspects [19] including that we provided a brief
one-time practice facilitation training online about refer-
ral procedures for all practices (both paper and e-
referrals), encouraged referrals through motivational
follow-up calls, but did not conduct in-person detailing,
nor did we incentivize practices for each referral. Each
practice was allowed to consider how to best integrate
the referrals into their workflow, [14] allowing variation
in implementation fidelity. Consistent with the goals of
an implementation science study, we did not have strict
guidelines on who to refer or the number of referrals re-
quired of practices, nor did we provide referrals incen-
tives. The practices were told that the web-assisted
tobacco intervention had content for all smokers,Houston et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:154 Page 5 of 16
regardless of their readiness to quit. We provided them
the system and training, but the adoption and use of the
system was left to them. Thus, we anticipated and mea-
sured variation in implementation success.
Trial 1 (implementation) statistical analyses
Baseline practice characteristics were collected through
a paper survey as part of the recruitment process.
Among the e-referral practices, we measured the use of
the components of the portal (referrals, patient secure
messaging, practice feedback). For both comparison and
intervention practices, we monitored rates of referral
and patient registration.
Practice ePortal and e-referral system use data which
was collected by the web server as activity logs linked to
each individual practice. Self-report referral data was
also collected for all paper- and e-referral practices
during follow-up booster calls. Additionally, referral data
for the e-referral practices was also tracked online (self-
report and web-tracked referral rates were highly corre-
lated (coefficient = 0.7)). To avoid bias from differential
measurement, self-report of referral was used as the
primary measure across both groups. For practice-level
implementation success analyses, our outcomes were the
number of reported referrals per practice and the num-
ber and proportion of referred patients who registered
per practice. We analyzed using both ttest and negative
binomial models as appropriate for count data with
over-dispersion.
Trial 2: clinical effectiveness of the web-assisted
tobacco intervention
Patients from both paper-referral and e-referral prac-
tices had access to the D2Q WATI registration. D2Q
was designed with separate modules, allowing patient-
level randomization. Once patients (from all practices)
registered and completed an online consent form, the
WATI system automatically randomized them to
three levels of the WATI. A randomization table,
block randomized with blocks of 10, was pre-
populated, and the system used this table to assign
different features of the WATI to different smokers.
As technology-assisted interventions are often multi-
component and evolve over time, and fractional fac-
torial designs like ours are increasingly used to assess
the effect of various components [20 –22]. These
designs are more efficient than full factorial designs.
As all smokers received some level of WATI, they
were blinded to the assignment group. Investigative
team members involved in 6-month smoking cessa-
tion outcomes (7-day point prevalence measure) were
blinded to randomization assignment.Patient sample
Inclusion criteria included being an active smoker,
having been referred from a paper-referral or e-
referral practice, and completing consent procedure.
An active smoker was defined as smoking at least
o n ep u f fo fac i g a r e t t eo rc i g a ri nt h el a s t7d a y s .W e
included smokers regardless of whether they were
ready to quit or not yet ready. All active smokers 18
and over were included. As we did not require a cer-
tain level of participation, all smokers randomized
were considered for intent-to-treat analyses.
Intervention: Decide2Quit.org web-assisted tobacco
modules
The D2Q WATI was designed for all smokers, sup-
porting cessation-induction for those not ready to
quit and acting as an aid-to-cessation for those pre-
paring to quit [16]. D2Q was implemented as an
adaptable service with modules that could be engaged
based on assigned group. Thus, within practices, indi-
vidual smokers were allocated, using our online sys-
tem and a block-randomization table similar to the
p r a c t i c el e v e lt oo n eo ft h et h r e ei n c r e a s i n g l y
enhanced versions of D2Q. The smokers completed
an online consent form prior to randomization. The
interventions received by the three randomized
groups of smokers are described below.
The control
The smokers randomized to the active control re-
ceived an interactive, tailored quit smoking website .
This module included motivational information tai-
lored to readiness to quit (not thinking of quitting,
thinking of quitting, preparing to quit) and interactive
risk, decisional balance, and cessation barrier calcula-
tors and games linking the chemicals in smoking with
their other uses (e.g., formaldehyde is used in both
cigarettes and in embalming). The control also in-
cluded a library of informational resources about
smoking and sections on seeking social support and
talking to your doctor about quitting (see screenshots
in Additional file 3, and accompanying video,
Additional file 4). These tools are variations of those
in many previously studied evidence-based WATI. As
noted in the Cochrane review, WATIs that include
tailored content are more likely to demonstrate an
effect [17]. Thus, ours is an active control represent-
ing the state of the art in public health websites.
The messaging group: pushed motivational email messages
module plus control module
For this group, we enhanced the control with a pushed
motivational email messaging system. Brief motivational
email messages (Additional file 5) were further tailoredHouston et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:154 Page 6 of 16
to an individual smoker ’s readiness to quit (not ready to
quit, thinking about quitting, preparing to quit, actively
quitting). In the first week of registration, four email
messages were sent to the smoker, followed thereafter by
two email messages per week. To enhance the personal
relevance of the messages, our motivational email mes-
saging system included messages written by smokers for
other smokers [23].
Personalized group: personal support module, messages
module, and control module
In addition to the above functions, the personal support
module further included the following: (1) an innovative
secure messaging portal allowing asynchronous elec-
tronic communication between smokers and trained to-
bacco treatment specialists (TTS) hired to participate in
the intervention team and (2) a link to an online support
group (BecomeAnEx.org).
Although trained at two training centers, all TTS were
trained for the following: determinants of nicotine de-
pendence; pharmacotherapy; counseling theory and
practice, including motivational interviewing, treatment
strategies, substance abuse, and mental health disorders;
and intake and treatment planning. Each TTS was re-
quired to pass a TTS exam as completion of the course.
All TTS met weekly prior to recruitment of the first par-
ticipants, and the meetings continued for several weeks
into the study. During these meetings, the TTS reviewed
the principles of motivational interviewing. Once re-
cruitment began, the TTS met to discuss any thoughts,
issues, or challenges in expressing Motivational Inter-
viewing skills via asynchronous secure messaging.
Asynchronous communication between patients and
TTS began with a message sent by the patient once they
logged into the site. The TTS have access to a portal in
which they checked daily for any assigned messages. The
TTS created responses based on current guidelines and
using Motivational Interviewing techniques [24]. Exam-
ples include rolling with resistance, asking patients to
identify barriers, evaluate self-efficacy, and determining
level of addiction.
One such example message sent and a reply corres-
pondence is the following:
Patient: Hi. My doctor said he wanted me to check
out this website. I love smoking, but I know I should
quit, but I ’m having trouble finding incentive. Can
you help?
Response: Hi. You ’ve made a great step in the right
direction by logging in to the website. I know it can
be challenging to begin to think about quitting. You
mentioned having trouble finding incentives …..what
about making finding incentives a first step/goal?Make a list of all the reasons you have to quit. Then
I’m sure the motivation will follow. Also, you could
think about what you think will be your biggest
barriers to successfully quitting. Identifying what sorts
of things keep us from quitting is the first step in
overcoming them! Message me back and let me know
what you think!
Note that in our original protocol, we planned to
randomize the smokers into two groups, the control and
personalized. During the progress of this 5-year trial, evi-
dence for web-assisted tobacco interventions continued
to develop, especially regarding the importance of tai-
lored messaging. Our study leadership recognized the
importance of differentiating the messaging intervention
and the personalized engagement with a tobacco treat-
ment specialist online. Thus, the original control group
was further randomly subdivided into the control
website-only group and the messaging group (as de-
scribed above). The reason for splitting the original
groups into control, messaging and personalized
groups, an augmentation of the original protocol, was
that the literature on tailored messaging has contin-
ued to evolve, and our team decided it would be ap-
propriate to compare messaging to personalized and
messaging to control.
Patient characteristics and outcomes measurement
The smoker characteristics and D2Q system use were
collected online. At 6 months, a follow-up was con-
ducted using both online and telephone surveys to col-
lect a 6-month and 7-day point prevalence self-reported
cessation.
At the patient level, we hypothesized that the propor-
tion of smokers who quit at 6 months would be greater
among those in the fully enhanced “personalized ”group
as compared with the messaging group and the standard
control only. We also hypothesized that the proportion
of smokers who quit at 6 months would be greater
among those who received motivational messages (per-
sonalized and messaging combined), compared with the
control.
Statistical analysis of a 6-month and 7-day point
prevalent cessation
Our analyses were framed around the hypotheses and
used intent-to-treat principles. The smokers were ana-
lyzed as randomized regardless of the level of engage-
ment with the systems (fidelity of intervention). All
analyses were conducted in the STATA statistical soft-
ware package (StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical Software:
Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) with con-
firmation in SAS (SAS software, Version [8] of the SAS
System for Windows).Houston et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:154 Page 7 of 16
For our primary clinical effectiveness outcome (6-
month and 7-day point prevalence cessation), we com-
pared those randomized to receive all enhanced features
(personalized) with the messaging Group and then the
control WATI. To analyze the effect of the messaging
module, we compared the control with all those who re-
ceived the messaging module (the messaging group and
the personalized group combined).
A challenge for all cessation-induction trials is missing
outcome data [25 –27]. This is especially true in light-
touch technology-assisted interventions. Most often, a
complete case or missing case (penalized imputation) in-
dicative of smoking analysis has been implemented in lo-
gistic regression. However, the reason that we did not
use penalized imputation as the primary outcome is that
new literature has been published suggesting that penal-
ized imputation (or missing = smoking) is not a conser-
vative approach and can be biased toward the
intervention [26]. Thus, for studies with missing cessa-
tion data greater than 10 –20 %, experts recommend
using selection models to examine the robustness of
findings [25]. We compared the characteristics of the pa-
tients who remained in the trial and those lost to follow-
up (see Additional file 6). For our primary models, using
a generalized linear model with a logit link to evaluate
cessation outcomes and GEE methods to account for
clustering within practices, we implemented a selection
model using inverse probability weighting to determine
the potential effect of the missing data. First, based on
covariates available within the dataset, we developed a
logistic regression model to predict the amount of miss-
ing data. Then, we calculated the inverse probability of
not being missing and weighted the main analysis by this
probability [28]. Since the primary models each examine
a hypothesis (and secondary completed cases and penal-
ized imputation models are confirmatory and not ex-
ploratory), we report each pvalue with no adjustment
for the total number of tests conducted.
Results
Following the format of the “Methods ”section, we first
present the practice (ePortal) implementation trial success
(trial 1) and then the clinical effectiveness (Trial 2) of the
WATI on 6-month 7-day point prevalent cessation.
Trial 1: clinical practice ePortal implementation
One thousand, seven hundred and forty-four primary care
practices expressed interest in participating, and 174
(10 %) fully completed enrollment and randomization.
Those who participated were smaller (65.1 % solo practice
versus 55.6 % in non-participating, chi-square p=0 . 0 2 )
and somewhat more likely to report previous referrals of
smokers to quit-lines (47.3 % in participating versus
39.9 % in non-participating, chi-square p= 0.06) and morefrequently to report seeing over 20 smokers per week (71 %
versus 65 %, chi-square p=0 . 1 ) .
The 174 practices who participated were small (solo
physician = 68 % in e-referral, 63 % in paper-referral)
and saw a median of 40 smokers per week (Table 2).
The volume of patients was balanced across e-referral
and paper-referral practices. All practices had at least
one staff trained; 67.8 % of the e-referral practices and
72.4 % of the paper-referral practices had two; 8.1 % of
e-referral practices and 4.6 % of paper-referral had an
additional member of the practices trained. Of those
trained, 17 % were physicians, 4 % nurse practitioners/
physician assistants, 10 % nurses, and 69 % medical as-
sistants or other office staff.
Use of the ePortal in intervention practices
Eighty-one of the eighty-seven practices randomized to
e-referral referred at least one smoker. The total re-
ported number of smokers e-referred within 6 months
was 2166 (mean referrals per practice 24.89 (SD 22.29),
range from 0 to 142 (interquartile range 8 –37)) (Fig. 2).
In addition to the automated e-referral driven reminder
emails by the system, physicians and office staff from
slightly over half of e-referral practices (55 %, 48/87)
used the ePortal to send personalized messages to their
smokers after registration (among those using messa-
ging, mean messages per practice = 8.7 (SD 15.7), range
1t o8 8 ) .
Among the 87 intervention practices, the mean num-
ber of views of the practice feedback dashboard was 20.3
([SD 22.7], range 1 to 130, median 12, interquartile
range (IQR) 29.5). To estimate the impact of the practice
feedback on referral behavior, we assessed the rates of e-
referral stratified by the use of the practice feedback
dashboard. E-referral practices that did not use the prac-
tice feedback had a mean referral rate of 15 (SD 15)
within 6 months, and those that viewed the practice
feedback report between 1 and 10 times had a mean of
21 referrals (SD 18), compared with those who viewed
them over 10 times (mean 30 referrals [SD 25]) pfor
trend across categories = 0.008.
Comparing referrals and registrations by randomization
(paper versus ePortal)
Hypothesis 1 (Refer): Similar to ePortal practices, 82
paper-referral practices had at least 1 referral, and paper-
referral practices reported referring 2623 smokers (mean
referrals per practice 30.15 [SD 25.45]) in 6 months (not
statistically different compared with the ePortal [p =
0.15 for the difference mean referrals] ). The range of
paper-referrals was 0 to 150 (IQR 12 –42). While the total
number of e-referrals was only 83 % as great as the num-
ber of paper-referrals, this difference was again not signifi-
cant based on a negative binomial count regression modelHouston et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:154 Page 8 of 16
(incidence rate ratio = 0.83 (95 % confidence interval (CI)
0.63, 1.08), p=0 . 1 7 ) .
Hypothesis 2 (Go) —smoker registration : Among ePortal
practices, the mean percent of referred smokers register-
ing was 31 % (SD = 25), compared with 11 % (SD 15)
from paper-referral practices ( p= 0.001), as shown in
Fig. 2. The mean number registered per e-referred prac-
tice was = 6.90 (SD = 8.65) versus 2.85 (SD = 3.45) from
the paper-referrals ( p= 0.01). In further analyses using
count regression, during the 6 months of follow-up,
e-referred patients registered at 2.42 times the rate of
patients referred with paper referrals (incident rate
r a t i o = 2 . 4 2 ,9 5%C I :1 . 7 2 –3.40).
Figure 3 is a scatterplot that has, on the horizontal ac-
cess, the number of smokers referred by each practice
and, on the vertical axis, the number of smokers regis-
tered. Each practice is represented as a point (red for
intervention, blue for control), with a super-imposed
trend line. Although the dots are similarly distributed
across the horizontal axis, there was considerable vari-
ation overall in rates of referral. The trend lines show
very clearly that you get more people registered per per-
son referred with the ePortal intervention. Note thatthere were only two control practices that had over 10
smokers register, whereas 22 ePortal practices had over
10 smokers register.
Trial 2: clinical effectiveness of the web-assisted
tobacco intervention
A total of 990 primary care patients registered, with 900
reporting active smoking (see consort diagram —Fig. 4).
Most were female (63 %), between 35 –55 years of age
(50 %), and smoked 11 –20 cigarettes per day (Table 3),
and these characteristics did not differ by randomization
group.
Use of the web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2-
Quit.org) by smokers
The number of return visits to the WATI differed by
treatment condition and was highest in the personalized
group (mean visits 2.52 (SD = 4.09), median 1, IQR 2),
followed by the messaging group (1.81 (SD = 1.26), me-
dian 1, IQR 1), and followed by the control “state-of-the
art WATI ”(mean 1.71 (SD = 1.14), median 1, IQR 2)
(control versus messaging, p= 0.37; control versus per-
sonalized, p< 0.001; trend across groups, p< 0.001). In
the personalized group, the smokers had access to a to-
bacco treatment specialist and online peer support
group; 33.64 % ( N=147) of smokers used the asynchron-
ous tobacco treatment specialist messaging (mean
2.31 messages (SD = 4.29), median 1, IQR 1), and
21.74 % ( N= 95) used the online peer support group
(mean 1.78 visits (SD = 1.52), median 1, IQR 1).
Six-month and seven-day point prevalence smoking ces-
sation (patient hypotheses)
Of the 900 active smokers, 14 % declined follow-up, and
34 % could not be contacted (Fig. 4). Smoking cessation
(Tables 4) was higher (25 % cessation in completed
cases) among those in the fully enhanced (personalized)
compared to those randomized to standard functions
(control) (17 %) ( p= 0.06), although this is not statisti-
cally significant. The personalized group had a similar
rate of cessation to those in the messaging group (25.23
versus 26.73 %), which was not significantly different.
Using the selection model (Table 4), the smokers in the
enhanced groups who received pushed motivational mes-
sages (personalized and messaging) were more likely to quit
(odds ratio 1.69 (95 % CI 1.03 –2.8) p=0 . 0 3 8 )a sc o m p a r e d
with the control-without-messages group. In secondary
analysis with all those lost to follow-up assigned to missing,
we again found a similar result (odds ratio 1.732, (95 % CI
1.08–2.77) p= 0.022) . When comparing across the three
modeling techniques, note that there was no meaningful
nor significant difference comparing the messaging group
to the personalized group, all comparisons of personalized
versus control did not reach p=0 . 0 5 ( pvalue range 0.063Table 2 Trial 1: comparing paper-referral and ePortal practice

parisons of those receiving messages did reach significance
(pvalue range from 0.021 to 0.038 and odds ratios 1.688 =
1.732).
In this trial, we recruited all active smokers, including
those in the motivation phase (not ready to quit, think-
ing about quitting), and precessation phase (preparing to
quit, set a quit date). In stratified analyses, the motiv-
ational messages were similarly effective among those in
the motivation phase (6-month cessation 23 versus 15 %
control; odds ratio 1.616, 95 % CI 0.91 –2.87) and those
who already quit (37 versus 24 % control; odds ratio
1.932, 95 % CI 0.59 –6.38).
Discussion
We successfully completed a large, community-based
implementation trial, integrating a provider e-referral
system and a patient-directed WATI. Among the
smokers referred, the e-referral was far more effective,
with nearly threefold greater registrants (31 %) thanpaper (11 %). Enhancing the standard control with mo-
tivational messages improved the comparative effective-
ness of the WATI. For the average e-referral clinical
practice, the combination of increased patient registra-
tion and increased relative cessation of the virtually inte-
grated e-referral/enhanced technology-assisted tobacco
intervention resulted in enhanced quality of care for
smokers.
The rate of referral was slightly less in ePortal practices.
This is likely due to the increase in effort required to en-
gage with the ePortal. In our pre-implementation pilot
work, we reported that several physicians believed that an
e-referral requires some additional effort from and train-
ing of practice staff [9]. With this in mind, we tried to in-
tegrate the ePortal into clinic ’s workflow. We designed the
e-referral portal to use the data collected to provide feed-
back and positive reinforcement to providers, feedback
that was not available to paper-referral practices. Practices
could also use the data collected to provide feedback and
positive reinforcement to providers, feedback that was not

available to paper-referral practices. As noted, more views
of the practice reports were associated with more e-
referrals. In the initial implementation of the system, the
e-referral providers had found these reports helpful in mo-
tivating continued e-referral activity, and thus, we inte-
grated performance feedback into the portal [9].
As hypothesized, paper referral was a “thin”interven-
tion, with only 11 % of smokers registering. There are
few comparisons for benchmarking our registration
rates. Offline, fax referrals have been used as a proactive
way to refer patients to telephone quit-lines [10, 29].
Once referred, quit-lines will proactively call patients,
and of patients referred, quit-line staff was successful in
enrolling approximately 20 –30 % [10, 29, 30]. The e-referralregistration rate of 31 % is important when considering the
“higher-than-usual-for-Internet-interventions ”percentage
of referred patients who were not ready to quit [31].
Our positive clinical effectiveness result that smokers
randomized to receive enhanced, proactive features were
more likely to quit extends our knowledge beyond the
conclusions of the recent Cochrane review of WATIs
[17]. In a recent review of WATI by the Cochrane col-
laboration, pooled results from trials that compared
interactive WATI to usual care or written self-help de-
tected significant effects in favor of the intervention with
a calculated odds ratio of 1.46 (and relative risk of
1.41)—based on pooled data from three studies. To
place our study into context, note that these WATI trialsFig. 3 The number of smokers referred and registered by each practiceHouston et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:154 Page 11 of 16
have compared the WATI with usual care or written
materials. Our absolute difference in cessation (ranging
from 8.7 to 5.2 % favoring with messages over control) is
greater than prior WATI trials, even considering our
robust control condition. Our control was an evidence-
aligned state-of-the-art website built with extensive tailor-
ing based on readiness to quit and other interactive
components. Using this active control, we then added
enhanced proactive components (e.g., pushed auto-
mated messages). Our results support the recent re-
port on the effectiveness of pushed motivational text
messages [32]. These short, frequent messages spaced
over time are more likely beneficial than modular
“bolus ”online motivation.In the personalized group, the further availability of a
tobacco treatment specialist and online support group
was minimally utilized and did not result in a marginal
improvement in effectiveness. This arm may not have
been engaging enough to smokers, resulting in less-
than-optimal rates of participation with the TTS. Given
the asynchronous pattern of communication, this func-
tion may have been difficult for patients to engage with
and use. Because of the additional marginal cost in the
setting of an interactive technology intervention, health
systems should consider carefully how best to use to-
bacco treatment specialists. Further research is needed
on how best to engage smokers and tobacco treatment
specialist support online.

Consistent with our goal, we successfully registered
smokers who were not yet preparing to quit. This
places our study in contrast to most web-assisted to-
bacco interventions who have only recruited smokers
who were preparing to quit or actively quitting [31].
In our prior work, we have demonstrated that recruit-
ment from clinical practices results in more smokersnot yet ready to quit, as compared with recruitment
through other mechanisms, such as Google advertise-
ments, another important benefit to clinical integra-
tion of the WATI. In subset analyses, we
demonstrated that these harder to reach, not yet
ready to quit smokers, also benefitted from the en-
hanced, messaging component of the WATI, withTable 3 Trial 2: clinical effectiveness of the WATI, characteristics of active smokers registering from clinical practicesa, b

higher quit rates in the enhanced (messaging or
personalized) compared with the control WATI.
All trials have limitations. As we made the decision
to separate into three groups (the original control
group was further randomly subdivided into the con-
trol website-only group and the messaging group),
this reduced our power to detect differences by sub-
group. Note that although our retention rate of 52 %
at 6 months is higher than many published trials of
technology-assisted tobacco interventions, [22, 26, 27]
the non-response rate is an important consideration
in interpreting our patient-level results. As recom-
mended, [25] we used multiple analytic methods to
explore the bias that could be introduced by attrition.
Recommendations from the Society for Research on
Nicotine and Tobacco on the need for biochemical
verification [33] state that the degree of misclassi-
fication is moderated by characteristics of the smok-
ing cessation intervention. The more intensive the
intervention is, the higher the potential for mis-
classification due to social desirability. Differential
misclassification by randomization group, an even
more problematic measurement issue, increases with
the intensity difference between groups. In studies
similar to ours, misclassification and differential
misclassification are expe cted to be lower, where
biochemical verification is not required and can intro-
duce other problems, including refusal to participate
[33, 34]. The patients in our sample were highlyeducated, although compared with the sample derived
from Google, our sample is actually less educated
[31].
Conclusion
We have presented evidence of implementation suc-
cess and comparative effectiveness of an integrated
primary care practice e-referral/patient motivational
system on smoker engagement and cessation. Health-
care systems should move beyond paper-referral
“information prescriptions ”only. There will always be
a place for paper reminders, but they should be
considered in a supportive role. For the increasing
numbers of patients who can access the Internet,
email or text messages, clinical practice e-referrals
will result in higher rates of engagement, enhancing
the reach of technology-assisted publically available
interventions, and potentially enhancing clinical inter-
ventions. Future work should also explore making
e-referrals an integral function of electronic health
records, where providers will increasingly conduct the
work of clinical care. In our pilot implementation,
our highest e-referring practice had integrated
e-referral into their electronic health record [14].
Although our system was limited to smoking, the
concept of electronic referrals could be used for other
targeted behaviors and chronic disease self-
management systems, a fertile area for further studies.Table 4 Trial 2: Clinical Effectiveness of the WATI, Six-month cessation by allocation to Technology-Assisted Tobacco Intervention
