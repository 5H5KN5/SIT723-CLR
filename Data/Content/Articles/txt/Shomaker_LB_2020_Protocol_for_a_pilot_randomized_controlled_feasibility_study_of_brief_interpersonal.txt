Abstract
Background: Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant adolescents is a major public health concern.
Excess GWG increases risk of pregnancy complications as well as postpartum and offspring obesity and
cardiometabolic disease. Prevention interventions for pregnant adults that target lifestyle modification (i.e., healthy
eating/physical activity) show insufficient effectiveness. Pregnant adolescents have distinct social-emotional needs,
which may contribute to excess GWG. From an interpersonal theoretical framework, conflict and low social support
increase negative emotions, which in turn promote excess GWG through mechanisms such as overeating and
physical inactivity.
Methods: The current manuscript describes the design of a pilot randomized controlled feasibility trial of
adolescent interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to address social-emotional needs and prevent excess GWG. Up to 50
pregnant, healthy adolescents 13-19y, 12-18 weeks gestation are recruited from an interdisciplinary adolescent
maternity hospital clinic and randomized to IPT + usual care or usual care alone. IPT involves 6 individual 60-minute
sessions delivered by a trained behavioral health clinician during 12-30 weeks gestation. Sessions include
relationship psychoeducation, emotion identification and expression, and teaching/role-playing communication
skills. Between sessions, adolescents are instructed to complete a daily journal and to have conversations to work
on relationship goals. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, mid-program, post-program, and 3-months postpartum.
Primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability based upon rate of recruitment, session attendance, program
acceptability ratings, and follow-up retention. Secondary outcomes are perinatal social functioning, stress,
depression, and eating behaviors assessed with validated surveys and interviews; perinatal physical activity and

adiposity by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, maternal insulin sensitivity derived from 2-hour oral glucose
tolerance testing, and infant adiposity by air displacement plethysmography.
Discussion: This pilot trial will address a key gap in extant understanding of excess GWG prevention for a high-risk
population of adolescents. If feasible and acceptable, brief psychotherapy to address social-emotional needs should
be tested for its effectiveness to address excess GWG and postpartum maternal/infant health. If effective, such an
approach has potential to interrupt an adverse, intergenerational cycle of social-emotional distress, obesity, and
cardiometabolic disease among young mothers and their offspring.

Background
An estimated 194,400 babies were born in 2017 to
mothers ages 15 –19 years in the USA [ 1]. Major racial/
ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities persist in
adolescent pregnancy and childbearing. Non-Hispanic
Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native ad-
olescents are far more likely to bear children (27 –33 per
1000) than Non-Hispanic White (13 per 1000) and
Asian adolescents (3 per 1000) [ 1]. Similar to adults, the
majority of pregnant adolescents, approximately two-
thirds, gain more weight in pregnancy than recom-
mended by the Institute of Medicine guidelines [ 2]. This
excess weight gain pattern is observed both in adoles-
cents who are lean and those who have overweight/obes-
ity. Moreover, high rates of excess gestational weight
gain (GWG) remain consistent when based upon adult-
cutoffs for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI; kg/m2)
or on age- and sex-adjusted pre-pregnancy BMI ( z-
score) [ 2]. Experts have called for recognition of excess
GWG in adolescent pregnancy as a major public health
concern because it not only increases antepartum and
peripartum complications but also increases the risk of
postpartum weight retention and future metabolic risk
for both the mother and her offspring [ 3].
Problem of excess GWG in adolescent pregnancy
Excess GWG in adolescent pregnancy has multiple nega-
tive consequences. Excess GWG amplifies the risk of
pregnancy complications from pre-existing obesity, in-
cluding gestational diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia,
and need for Cesarean delivery [ 4–8]. In addition, excess
GWG amplifies mothers ’risk of obesity and cardiometa-
bolic disease after pregnancy [ 9–12]. The more excess
weight gained in pregnancy, the more weight retained in
the postpartum, increasing mothers ’long-term risk of
obesity and cardiometabolic disease progression [ 9–12].
In a large investigation of maternal and fetal growth dur-
ing adolescent pregnancy, adolescents with excess GWG
had greater postpartum weight retention, BMI, central
adiposity, and peripheral adiposity over a 2-year periodcompared to adolescents who gained recommended
amounts of weight [ 13]. Pregnant adolescents with ex-
cess GWG were nearly 5 times more likely to have obes-
ity approximately 12 years post-delivery than those who
gained appropriate weight [ 9]. While similar adverse ef-
fects have been documented in adults [ 14], excess GWG
in adolescent pregnancy may be particularly deleterious
[13]. In a study comparing adolescent and adult preg-
nancies, adolescents with excess GWG continued to gain
more weight between an initial and subsequent preg-
nancy as compared to adults [ 15]. Adolescence itself is
marked by increases in weight and adiposity in females;
therefore, pubertal gains in central adiposity are likely
exacerbated when pregnancy is timed in adolescence
[13].
Beyond the adverse effects on mothers, excess GWG also
affects offsprings ’risk of obesity and cardiometabolic disease
[7,8,16–21]. This intergenerational effect perpetuates a
cycle of obesity and cardiomet abolic disease in a population
at high-risk for social stressors, emotional difficulties, obes-
ity, and preventable chronic illness [ 22–25]. Offspring of
adolescent and adult mothers with excess GWG have higher
odds of macrosomia, greater ne onatal adiposity, higher BMI
in childhood and adolescence, and greater cardiovascular
disease risk factors in childhood [ 7,8,16–21,26]. The “fetal
overnutrition ”explanation, supported by animal and human
studies, is that intrauterine ca loric excess creates a metabolic
milieu that heightens obesity and cardiometabolic risk, inde-
pendent of other genetic and postnatal environmental risk
factors, through a host of mech anisms such as insulin resist-
ance and subsequent hyperin sulinemia, hyperglycemia,
hypertriglyceridemia, increased fat deposition in subcutane-
ous and intrahepatic depots, cha nges in appetite regulation,
mitochondrial function, impaired functioning of the adi-
poinsular axis, and epigenetic modifications [ 27]. Thus, feas-
ible and effective preventio n of excess GWG in pregnant
adolescents is a priority for reducing adolescent mothers ’
obesity and cardiometabolic disease risk, and for disrupting
the transgenerational cycle of obesity and cardiometabolic
disease affecting offspring of successive generations [ 28].Shomaker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:39 Page 2 of 14
Prevention of excess GWG
There have been few interventions designed to address
excess GWG in pregnant adolescents. In adult pregnant
women, the standard approach is lifestyle modification
intended to promote healthy eating and physical activity.
In an expert review of over 50 randomized controlled
trial studies in pregnant adult women, existing programs
unfortunately were concluded to be costly, time inten-
sive, and limited in effectiveness and scope [ 29]. In non-
pregnant adolescents who have overweight/obesity,
lifestyle-based interventions to address weight manage-
ment face challenges for adherence and effectiveness,
particularly in youth from historically disadvantaged ra-
cial/ethnic groups [ 30–34]. Thus, alternative strategies
to lifestyle-based approaches that are feasible and ac-
ceptable to pregnant adolescents are highly warranted.
One potentially promising framework is to target the
underlying social-emotional contributors to excess GWG in
pregnant adolescents. Interpers onal conflict, insufficient so-
cial support, and emotional co ncerns such as depression are
highly prevalent in pregnant adolescents [ 35]. During preg-
nancy, interpersonal stress inc reases within romantic part-
nerships, and potential lack of involvement from the father-
of-the-child is related to higher levels of depression symp-
toms in adolescents [ 36,37]. Inadequate social support, per-
ceived stress, and depression symptoms have been
associated with excess GWG an d postpartum weight reten-
tion [ 38–41]. In pregnant adolescents, prevalence of elevated
depression symptoms (14 –48%) is doubled compared to
both non-pregnant adoles cents and to adult pregnant
women [ 42–45]. Adolescents who gain weight rapidly and
who have greater total GWG report the highest levels of de-
pression during pregnancy, as compared to adolescents who
have slow or adequate GWG [ 46]. As displayed in Fig. 1,w e
propose that poor social functioning may contribute to per-
ceived stress and depression symptoms, which promote ex-
cess GWG through mechanisms such as overeating in an
attempt to cope with negative emotions, physical inactivity,
and sleep disturbance [ 47–52].
Therefore, interventions designed for pregnant adoles-
cents to decrease interpersonal conflict, improve social
support, and reduce perceived stress and depression
offer the potential to serve as a novel approach to miti-
gate excess GWG. Consistent with this possibility, one
cluster-randomized trial compared group prenatal care
with usual individual care for improving reproductive
outcomes among pregnant adolescents and young
women (ages 14 –21 years). In secondary analyses, the in-
vestigators found that those in group care showed
greater reductions in perinatal depression symptoms
[53] and had less GWG and less weight retention at 12-
months postpartum [ 54]. In a separate study, a retro-
spective chart review analysis showed that pregnant ado-
lescents who had received group prenatal care weremore likely to have met GWG guidelines than adoles-
cents who had received individual care [ 55]. While
group prenatal care offers a promising approach to ex-
cess GWG in adolescent pregnancy, there are challenges
to centering group care in pregnant teenagers. Group
care can be difficult to coordinate in terms of timing of
patients ’gestational age, appointment cancellations, and
less overall flexibility to accommodate individual
schedules.
Alternatively, interpersonal interventions to target
social-emotional difficulties merit testing to address the
problem of excess GWG in adolescent pregnancy by im-
proving social functioning, perceived stress, and depres-
sion. Previous studies with adult pregnant women have
shown that interpersonal interventions are associated
with improvements in depression symptoms. For ex-
ample, adult pregnant women assigned to a 16-week
group-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) program
demonstrated greater improvements in depression
symptoms as compared to those assigned to a parent
education program [ 56,57]. Moreover, adult pregnant
women assigned to a culturally relevant, enhanced brief
IPT (i.e., 8 individual sessions during pregnancy and
maintenance sessions up to 6-months postpartum)
showed improvements in social functioning and depres-
sion symptoms at 6-months postpartum, as compared to
enhanced usual care [ 58].
Study objectives
The current study is a randomized controlled pilot and
feasibility study. The primary aim is to determine the
feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session adolescent IPT
program for prevention of excess GWG. We selected
IPT based on its demonstrated effectiveness in reducing
depression symptoms and improving social functioning
in non-pregnant adolescents, including adolescents from
diverse racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic back-
grounds, as well as pregnant adults [ 56–61]. Moreover,
IPT has demonstrated effectiveness in non-pregnant ad-
olescents in targeting other posited mechanisms for ex-
cess weight gain, such as emotional eating and binge-
eating [ 62]. IPT is delivered as a relatively brief, manua-
lized program using individual sessions every 2 –3 weeks,
throughout 12- to 30-weeks gestation. We are assessing
feasibility and acceptability of IPT as delivered within
the setting of an interdisciplinary adolescent pregnancy
hospital clinic. The secondary aim is to estimate the ef-
fect of IPT integrated into usual prenatal care, in com-
parison to usual care only, on key healthcare outcomes
grounded in the theoretical framework, including peri-
natal social functioning, perceived stress, depression
symptoms, eating behavior, physical activity, sleep,
GWG, delivery outcomes, and at 3-months postpartum,Shomaker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:39 Page 3 of 14
maternal weight retention, maternal/infant adiposity,
and maternal insulin sensitivity.
Methods/design
Setting, inclusion criteria, and recruitment
Enrollment for the current study takes place at the Col-
orado Adolescent Maternity Program (CAMP) clinic at
Children ’s Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado
School of Medicine/Anschutz Medical Campus in Aur-
ora, Colorado. The CAMP clinic is an interdisciplinary
adolescent perinatal program that includes an obstetri-
cian/gynecologist, a nurse midwife, nurse practitioners,
dieticians, social workers, psychologists, and case
coordinators.
Inclusion criteria for the study are: [ 1] age 13 –19 years
[2]; pregnant, 12 –18 weeks gestation; and [ 3] patient re-
ceiving care at the CAMP clinic. Exclusion criteria are
[1] current full-syndrome psychiatric disorder that, in
the opinion of the study investigators, would impede
study compliance and/or necessitate more intensive
treatment, such as conduct disorder, schizophrenia, or
major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation
[2]; regular medication use likely to affect mood or
weight, such as anti-depressants or stimulants [ 3]; high-
risk pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, ges-
tational diabetes, hypertension, multiple gestation, pla-
centa previa, membrane rupture, or incompetent cervix
[4]; major renal, hepatic, or endocrinological disorder,
such as hyperthyroidism or Cushing syndrome, or a pul-
monary disorder other than mild asthma; and [ 5] pre-
pregnancy BMI < 5th percentile for age/sex.
The main recruitment method involves presenting the
study in-person during prenatal intake visits to adoles-
cents who appear to be eligible based upon review of the
hospital electronic medical record. Trained research staff
review the medical record as an initial screen of inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria, including a review of adolescent
age, gestational age, known pregnancy complications,
medication use, and any major medical disorders that
would be exclusionary. Adolescents who appear to be
eligible based upon the medical record review are visited
at an initial prenatal appointment by trained research
staff, including nurses from the Perinatal Clinical and
Translational Research Center (CTRC) at Children ’sHospital Colorado, who briefly describe the study, assess
interest, and give patients a flyer and consent form to re-
view. Participants who are interested after this initial
visit are contacted by a study team member to schedule
an initial screening visit at the clinic. Other recruitment
methods include posting flyers in the clinic and mailing
letters and flyers to CAMP patients.
Consent
Research staff trained to work in research involving hu-
man subjects obtain written and active informed con-
sent from potential research participants in a quiet,
private room in the CAMP clinic at the screening/base-
line study visit. Pregnant minors are able to consent
themselves because, according to Colorado State Law, a
pregnant minor is emancipated to approve prenatal, de-
livery, and post-delivery medical care for herself related
to the intended live birth of a child (Colorado Revised
Statute 13-22-103.5). Patients seeking services in the
CAMP clinic typically attend appointments without a
parent or guardian present; thus, requiring parental
consent for participation wou ld potentially exclude par-
ticipants and bias findings. A dditionally, study partici-
pation involves minimal risk. To participate in the 3-
months postpartum maternal ad iposity/insulin sensitiv-
ity assessments, participants must either be ≥18 years
to provide informed consent or have a parent/guardian
provide consent.
Randomization and interventions
Adolescents who are determined to be eligible upon
completion of the baseline assessment are randomized
to IPT + usual CAMP clinic care or to usual care only.
Randomization is stratified by age (13 –16 years versus
17–19 years), weight status (normal weight, BMI 5 –84th
percentile versus overweight/obesity, BMI ≥85th per-
centile), race (Non-Hispanic White versus Other Race/
Ethnicity), and baseline depression symptom level (Cen-
ter for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-
D) survey total score < 21 versus CES-D total score ≥
21). Randomization strings were generated by an elec-
tronic program with permuted blocks.Fig. 1 Theoretical model of interpersonal problems and excess gestational weight gain (GWG)Shomaker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:39 Page 4 of 14
CAMP usual care
Participants in both conditions continue to receive
adolescent-focused interdisciplinary prenatal care at the
CAMP clinic. Adolescent-focused prenatal care generally
differs from adult-focused prenatal care by providing de-
velopmentally appropriate services that are tailored to
meet the unique social-emotional needs of adolescents
[63]. More specifically, adolescent-focused prenatal care
addresses co-occurring psychosocial stressors that are
more prevalent among pregnant adolescents as com-
pared to pregnant adults, such as mental health prob-
lems, substance abuse and use, school problems, family
conflict, and poverty [ 35]. At the CAMP clinic, in
addition to usual obstetrical prenatal care, CAMP pa-
tients are seen a minimum of 4 times by clinic social
workers, once for a psychosocial intake and 3 additional
times during pregnancy. Additional social worker ses-
sions are scheduled as needed. These meetings provide
information about mood changes in pregnancy and basic
education on postpartum depression. All patients also
meet once with a dietician during the first trimester to
review healthy weight gain and nutrition in pregnancy.
Additional dietician appointments are scheduled if con-
cerns about inadequate weight gain emerge or in the
event of significant nausea and/or vomiting.
Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
Adolescents randomized to IPT + usual care also are
scheduled for the IPT program, “Healthy Relationships,
Healthy Weight. ”This program was adapted from the
IPT for the Prevention of Excess Weight Gain (IPT-
WG) manual, which was designed for use in non-
pregnant adolescents at risk for excess weight gain be-
cause of above-average weight and disordered eating/
loss-of-control eating patterns [ 62]. The IPT-WG pro-
gram is a 12-session group intervention based on the
interpersonal theoretical model, which posits that con-
flictual interactions and lack of social support can
worsen or maintain negative affect [ 64]. Negative affect,
in turn, can lead to overeating when not hungry or over-
eating highly palatable, energy-dense foods (e.g., sweets
and snacks), which taken together, lead to excess weight
gain [ 64].
The adaptation of IPT-WG for the current study in-
cludes 3 key modifications. First, sessions are delivered
in an individual versus weekly group format to facilitate
flexible scheduling. Facilitators make every effort to
schedule in-person sessions so that they occur immedi-
ately before or after usual prenatal care appointments at
the CAMP clinic to minimize participant burden. De-
pending on participant preference, facilitators are avail-
able to schedule sessions at the CAMP clinic during
normal business hours, independent of usual prenatal
care. Moreover, sessions are scheduled once every 2 –3weeks starting after the baseline and screening visit and
ending by 28 –30 weeks gestation, thus providing support
to adolescents throughout their pregnancy. We chose
not to offer telephone sessions in this pilot feasibility
study in order to explicitly evaluate feasibility and ac-
ceptability of delivering an in-person program within an
interdisciplinary adolescent perinatal healthcare setting.
Second, the number and duration of sessions is de-
creased from 12 90-minute sessions to 6 60-minute ses-
sions. This change was based upon preliminary survey
data from CAMP clinic patients that indicated a prefer-
ence for 6 or fewer sessions. Finally, session content is
specifically tailored to address typical issues associated
with adolescent pregnancy.
A summary of session content for this adaptation of
IPT for the prevention of excess GWG is provided in
Table 1. The first session focuses on psychoeducation
about the connections among social relationships, mood,
eating behavior, and healthy weight gain in pregnancy.
This initial session also includes a brief interpersonal in-
ventory to assess adolescents ’current relationships and
to formulate explicit program goals centered on address-
ing conflict and support in current relationships. The
second session focuses on communication analysis, espe-
cially nonverbal aspects of communication. The third,
fourth, and fifth sessions involve learning new communi-
cation skills and applying these communication skills to
current relationships with an aim to increase support or
reduce conflict. Finally, the sixth session involves plan-
ning for using new communication skills in the context
of the transition of delivery and psychoeducation about
help-seeking in the future. Participants are encouraged
to apply skills learned in each session to current rela-
tionships in between sessions through home practice ex-
ercises. These home practice exercises are facilitated by
a binder with handouts. Facilitators call and/or text mes-
sage participants in between sessions to check-in and re-
mind them to complete home practice and attend the
following session.
IPT sessions are facilitated by a clinical psychologist or
by a graduate student in clinical/counseling psychology,
marriage and family therapy, or related field. All inter-
vention facilitators are trained by a program developer
(LBS) in the administration of the IPT program and re-
ceive clinical supervision on audio-recorded sessions
from a program developer and licensed clinical
psychologist.
At the beginning of each session, participants ’height
and weight are measured and participants also report
their mood on a Mood Monitoring Questionnaire. Any
participant whose mood worsens considerably or who
develops a psychiatric issue necessitating additional
treatment is immediately referred. In the event of an
acute psychiatric crisis (e.g., active suicidal ideation), theShomaker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:39 Page 5 of 14

Outcomes
Primary and secondary outcomes are summarized in
Table 2.
Primary outcomes
Feasibility of study Feasibility will be defined according
to several metrics, including feasible recruitment, enroll-
ment, and retention. Estimates are derived from previous
longitudinal studies with pregnant women [ 65,87–90].
Feasible recruitment will be defined as identifying at
least 480 potentially eligible patients based upon medical
record review by research staff to approach during the
prenatal intake visit. Feasible enrollment will be defined
as approximately 25% (120/480) of preliminary eligible
patients agreeing to schedule a screening/baseline as-
sessment and about 67% (80/120) attending the assess-
ment and enrolling in the study. Feasible enrollment will
be estimated as 60% (50/80) of enrolled patients being
eligible to be randomized. Finally, feasible retention will
be assessed as at least 75% (38/50) of randomized partic-
ipants successfully completing at least three of four as-
sessment intervals, including the baseline/screening
assessment. This definition of feasible retention refers to
the assessment intervals only and does not include the
IPT sessions.
Acceptability of IPT Acceptability will first be mea-
sured by IPT session attendance. Acceptable IPT session
attendance will be defined by 50% of participants ran-
domized to IPT attending 5 or 6 ( ≥80%) of the total 6
sessions [ 87–90]. Acceptability will also be measured by
participant ratings on a program acceptability interview
adapted for the current study from the Treatment
Process Questionnaire and administered by a project
staff at the end of treatment assessment [ 66]. This ques-
tionnaire asks participants to report on their reasons forenrolling in the study, what they liked and did not like
about the IPT program and the perceived impact of the
IPT program on their mood and health. Acceptable par-
ticipant ratings will be defined as above-average ratings.
Secondary outcomes
Social functioning, perceived stress, and depression
Participants complete self-report questionnaires asses-
sing social functioning, perceived stress, and depression
on a computer through Research Electronic Data Cap-
ture (REDCap). A project staff member reviews com-
pleted questionnaires for missing items before the
conclusion of the study visit and invites participants to
respond to those missing items.
Social functioning is measured by two questionnaires.
The Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report (SAS-SR) is a
23-item questionnaire assessing social role functioning
in several domains including peer, family, romantic rela-
tionships, and school/work [ 67]. Higher scores indicate
worse social functioning. The Network of Relationships
Inventory-Behavioral Systems Version (NRI-BSV) is a
28-item questionnaire assessing five social support fea-
tures and three negative interaction features [ 68]. Stress
is assessed as a continuous measure of stress perception
by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 10-item question-
naire [ 69]. Higher scores suggest greater stress percep-
tion. Depression is measured by two questionnaires. The
Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale
(CES-D), a 20-item questionnaire assessing depression
as a continuous measure of symptoms [ 70]. Depression
is also assessed as a continuous measure of symptoms
on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a
10-item questionnaire [ 71,72]. Higher scores on the
CES-D and the EPDS are indicative of more elevated de-
pression symptoms. Finally, depression diagnosis is
assessed via the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID), a
structured diagnostic interview for psychiatric disorders
in children and adolescents.Table 1 Summary of IPT session content for the randomized controlled pilot study protocol

Eating behavior The overeating section of the Eating
Disorders Examination (EDE) Version 14.0, a semi-
structured clinical interview [ 74,75], is administered by
trained research staff to assess overeating episodes with
and without a feeling of subjective loss-of-control. The
EDE has demonstrated good reliability and validity in
adolescent samples [ 91]. Emotional eating, referring to
eating in response to negative emotions, is assessed with
the Emotional Eating Scale-Adapted for Children and
Adolescents (EES-C) [ 76]. The EES-C is a 25-item self-report questionnaire that has shown good psychometric
properties in adolescent samples [ 76].
Physical activity and sleep disturbance Habitual phys-
ical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep disturbance
are derived from ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers
(ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL), which have well-established
validity and reliability in adolescents [ 77,79]. These

removed for water-based activities, such as showering or
swimming. Accelerometers record data with a sampling
frequency of 30 Hz using 60-second epochs. Light phys-
ical activity, moderate-to-vigorous activity, and sedentary
time are classified based on mean counts per epoch ac-
cording to established guidelines [ 78]. Parameters of
sleep disturbance include total sleep time, sleep onset la-
tency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency [ 80].
Gestational weight gain Weight is derived to the nearest
0.1 kg on a calibrated digital scale, and height is derived by
a stadiometer in triplicate. Weight and height will also be
derived from the medical record for intervals that do not
coincide with a study assessment interval. More specific-
ally, weight and height will be derived from the medical
records at prenatal appointments, at delivery, and at post-
natal appointments. Continuous GWG during pregnancy
will be measured using two metrics: [ 1] GWG during the
experimental phase, as defined by the difference between
measured maternal weight at the baseline assessment to
the post-program assessment, and [ 2] total GWG, as de-
fined by the difference between self-reported pre-
pregnancy weight and maternal weight at delivery, derived
from the medical record. Classification of pre-pregnancy
weight status as normal weight, overweight, or obese will
be based on CDC BMI percentile for age [ 81]. Categorical
GWG, defined as appropriate versus excessive, will be
measured relative to Institute of Medicine guidelines for
gestational age for both GWG during the experimental
phase and total GWG.
Maternal postpartum weight retention Continuous
maternal postpartum weight retention will be measured
as the difference in self-reported pre-pregnancy weight
and measured maternal weight at the 3-month postpar-
tum assessment [ 39].
Maternal postpartum adiposity For those who partici-
pate in the adjunct metabolic assessments, participants
have a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to
evaluate body composition, including total lean mass
and total fat mass, using Hologic QDR Discovery A (S/
N81337; Bedford, MA) [ 82]. DXA has demonstrated
good validity in youth [ 83].
Maternal postpartum insulin sensitivity Maternal in-
sulin sensitivity is derived from a 2-hour oral glucose
tolerance test at the 3-month postpartum interval. In the
morning following a 10-hour overnight fast, participants
ingest 1.75 g/kg of glucola (max = 75 g). Blood is sampled
via an intravenous line for insulin, glucose, and c-peptide
at fasting, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after ingesting
the glucola [ 85]. Insulin sensitivity will be estimated with
the whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), as wellas the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index
(QUICKI) and the homeostasis model assessment of insu-
lin resistance (HOMA-IR). These methods of measuring
insulin sensitivity have been validated against euglycemic-
hyperinsulinemic clamp-derived measures in youth with
overweight and obesity [ 84].
Infant adiposity At the 3-month postpartum assess-
ment, infants will complete a PEAPOD to evaluate fat
mass and fat-free mass using air displacement plethys-
mography [ 86].
Participant timeline
All assessments take place at the CAMP clinic, with the
exception of the 3-month postpartum assessment, which
takes place at the Outpatient Pediatric CTRC at Chil-
dren ’s Hospital Colorado. Participant timeline is pre-
sented in Table 3.
Screening/baseline assessment
Potentially eligible and interested volunteers are invited
to participate in a screening and baseline assessment ap-
pointment. This appointment takes approximately three
hours. A trained research staff member obtains informed
written consent. Participants complete online question-
naires via REDCap to assess social functioning, perceived
stress, depression symptoms, and eating behaviors. A
project staff member administers a structured clinical
interview to rule out the presence of a psychiatric dis-
order, current self-injurious behavior, or current suicidal
behavior that would warrant more intensive treatment.
Participants who meet criteria for a current full-
syndrome psychiatric disorder or who report current
and active suicidal ideation are immediately referred to
CAMP behavioral health staff for further evaluation and
treatment. At the screening visit, project staff also ad-
minister a semi-structured interview to assess eating pat-
terns, including overeating and binge eating, and review
a 3-day diet record. Research staff who administer clin-
ical interviews are trained by clinical psychologists
through a combination of didactics, role-playing, and
live supervision. Clinical interviews are audio-recorded
and reviewed by clinical psychologists on the research
team for fidelity to the interview protocol. At the end of
the screening visit, participants are fitted with an ambu-
latory accelerometer that they are asked to wear for
seven days following the study visit to measure habitual
physical activity. Participants are paid $50 for complet-
ing this screening visit. At the end of the screening visit,
eligible participants are randomized to either IPT +
usual care or usual care only.Shomaker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:39 Page 8 of 14
Mid-program assessment
Participants complete a brief assessment, estimated to
take no longer than 30 min, halfway through the experi-
mental phase, corresponding to about 6 –9 weeks after
the baseline assessment. Participants repeat question-
naires assessing social functioning, stress, depression
symptoms, and eating behaviors. They also re-wear the
accelerometer for seven days following the study visit to
re-assess habitual physical activity. Participants receive a
pack of newborn diapers for completing this mid-
program assessment.
Post-program assessment
Participants complete an assessment at the end of the ex-
perimental phase, which corresponds to about 12 –18
weeks after the baseline assessment and just prior to deliv-
ery. This assessment takes about two hours. Participants
repeat the same research tasks as at the baseline assess-
ment. In addition, a project staff member administers a
program acceptability interview to adolescents who wererandomized to the IPT condition. Participants are paid
$75 for completing the post-program assessment.
3-month postpartum assessment
Participants complete a final assessment at 3-months
postpartum, a time when inter-individual differences in
postpartum weight retention and postpartum depression
emerge [ 92]. Participants repeat the same research tasks
at the baseline assessment. Participants ’3-month old ba-
bies complete an infant body composition assessment
using air displacement plethysmography (PEAPOD). A
project staff member reviews the medical record to as-
sess measured height and weight at delivery and postpar-
tum appointments, as well as any pregnancy or birth
complications. Participants are paid $75 for completing
the 3-month postpartum assessment.
Participants are invited to opt in, or out, of an add-
itional adjunct metabolic study, which includes a mater-
nal DXA scan of post-partum adiposity and a 2-h oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to estimate maternalTable 3 Overview of a participant ’s timeline, assessment intervals, and core measures

Sample size
We plan to randomize 50 out of 80 (60%) enrolled par-
ticipants following a screening/baseline eligibility assess-
ment. Our estimation of a total sample size of N=5 0
(i.e.,n= 25 per condition) is based on recommendations
for a two-arm superiority pilot trail in which small-to-
moderate standardized effects are anticipated [ 93]. Fur-
thermore, our sample size estimation is consistent with
recommendations for pilot randomized trials using an
80% one-sided confidence interval approach to exclude a
clinically important difference between study arms [ 94].
Statistical analysis
Baseline participant characteristics and feasibility/accept-
ability findings will primarily be measured with descrip-
tive statistics, including mean with standard deviation,
median with interquartile range, frequency, and percent-
age. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to
evaluate group differences (IPT + usual care versus usual
care) in secondary outcomes, including social function-
ing, perceived stress, depression symptoms, eating be-
haviors, physical activity, sleep disturbance, maternal
post-partum insulin sensitivity, maternal post-partum
adiposity, and infant adiposity. We will use 95% confi-
dence intervals to measure precision of the estimated
differences between conditions, per recommendations
[95]. Given that this is a pilot study, results will be con-
sidered preliminary. Although our theoretical framework
suggests that IPT + usual care, as compared to usual
care only, will impact these secondary outcomes via a
series of mechanistic pathways, this pilot feasibility study
is not sufficiently powered to test mediation. Covariates
considered in these models will include baseline mater-
nal age, gestational age, race/ethnicity, baseline CES-D
score, and pre-pregnancy BMI/weight status. Missing
data will be examined for patterns of missingness and
imputation, with the intent-to-treat sample, will be used
if deemed appropriate. Given the pilot nature of the
study, we also will conduct sensitivity analyses using list-
wise deletion with complete data.
Ethics and dissemination
The protocol has been approved by a single Institutional
Review Board, the Colorado Multiple Institutional Re-
view Board (COMIRB), which provides oversight for the
University of Colorado School Of Medicine and Chil-
dren ’s Hospital Colorado. An Institutional Review Board
authorization agreement was established between the In-
stitutional Review Board of Colorado State University,
an administrative site, and COMIRB, in order for
COMIRB to serve as the primary IRB. We followInstitutional Review Board requirements pertaining to
reporting of unanticipated problems and adverse events.
Personal information is collected directly from re-
search participants and from their medical record. Per-
sonal information is stored separately from other
research data and will not be shared with anyone outside
of the research team, which includes personnel at the
University of Colorado, Children ’s Hospital Colorado,
and Colorado State University, with the exception of en-
tities that monitor human subject research, such as
COMIRB. Electronic data are stored and managed by
REDCap and a secure server at the University of Color-
ado. The REDCap system is password protected and
only accessible by research staff members. Digital audio
recordings from interviews and interventions are
uploaded to password-protected folders on a secure ser-
ver at the University of Colorado. After uploading, re-
cordings are deleted from the digital recording device.
Paper data are stored in locked cabinets in administra-
tive research space at Children ’s Hospital Colorado. All
data will be preserved for seven years following IRB ac-
knowledgement of study closure. Results and conclu-
sions from the current study will be disseminated by
publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference
presentations. We also will disseminate findings to clinic
providers who have been involved in supporting the
study.
Discussion
The current study is a randomized controlled feasibility
study piloting a novel approach to the prevention of ex-
cess GWG in adolescent pregnancy. The primary aim is
to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a relatively
brief, 6-session individual IPT program, delivered within
the context of an interdisciplinary adolescent pregnancy
hospital clinic. The secondary aim is to explore whether
there are health benefits to pregnant adolescents who re-
ceive IPT —in perinatal social functioning, perceived
stress, depression symptoms, eating behaviors, physical
activity, sleep, GWG, and postpartum maternal and in-
fant metabolic health —as compared to the usual care
that pregnant adolescents would receive in an interdis-
ciplinary adolescent maternity clinic.
Preventative interventions for excess GWG in adult
women have previously focused on lifestyle modification,
including healthy eating and physical activity. The avail-
able literature suggests that lifestyle-based interventions
require significant financial and time resources, and un-
fortunately, generally demonstrate insufficient effective-
ness [ 29]. Moreover, no study to date has been
specifically designed to evaluate a prevention of GWG
intervention in pregnant adolescents, even though excess
GWG is prevalent in this population and is associated
with serious, negative health outcomes [ 3]. PregnantShomaker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:39 Page 10 of 14
adolescents face unique socioemotional needs, often in-
cluding mental health problems, academic problems,
family conflict, and poverty [ 35]. There is growing evi-
dence that such social-emotional factors may interfere
with a healthy weight gain in pregnancy through their
influence on overeating to cope with negative emotions
and stress, reduced physical activity, and disturbed sleep
[96,97]. From an interpersonal theoretical framework,
receipt of an IPT intervention is posited to reduce con-
flict and increase support in adolescents ’interpersonal
relationships, which in turn, is theorized to improve per-
ceived stress and negative affect, and ultimately facilitate
healthy eating, physical activity, and sleep to influence a
healthy GWG.
The proposed pilot randomized feasibility study is the
first necessary step in understanding the potential utility
of an evidence-based psychotherapy intervention —ad-
dressing social functioning, stress, and negative emo-
tions —for prevention of excess GWG in adolescent
pregnancy. We anticipate that IPT will be feasible and ac-
ceptable to pregnant adolescents. Moreover, we have pre-
liminary data that suggest it will be feasible to incorporate
a psychosocial intervention into an interdisciplinary hos-
pital clinic, as evidenced by a 72% attendance rate in an
existing parenting skills training intervention in the
CAMP clinic. However, it is possible that there could be
obstacles to attendance (e.g., transportation). Some we
have anticipated (e.g., providing taxis and bus passes as
needed), but others (e.g., school/work schedules) could
interfere with sessions. A strength of the individualized
nature of our IPT program is that it permits a high degree
of flexibility in rescheduling sessions at alternative times.
With respect to secondary outcomes, we anticipate
that adolescents who receive IPT, relative to usual care
only, will show patterns of improved perinatal social
functioning, lower perceived stress, reduced depression
symptoms, healthier eating patterns, increased physical
activity, improved sleep, less excess GWG, and better
postpartum maternal and infant metabolic health. How-
ever, IPT may improve social-emotional adjustment
without preventing excess GWG or postpartum weight
retention and metabolic outcomes. In this case, we
would have initial evidence for a brief, potentially cost-
effective approach to improving social-emotional health
in pregnant adolescents, which has important public
health relevance for postpartum depression prevention
and maternal-infant health, given the serious, negative
effects of depression on maternal-infant psychosocial
outcomes [ 98]. Ultimately, results and conclusions have
the potential to benefit not only emotional and physical
health outcomes for adolescent mothers, but also health
outcomes for offspring as part of a larger public health
perspective on the intergenerational transmission of de-
pression, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease.Feasibility and acceptability findings from the current
pilot study will inform the development of a larger ran-
domized controlled trial that is adequately powered to
measure the effectiveness of this brief individual psycho-
social intervention to prevent excess GWG in adoles-
cents. Testing the effectiveness of this psychosocial
intervention within the structure of an existing interdis-
ciplinary adolescent maternity hospital clinic is ideal to
facilitate successful transfer of research-based knowledge
to routine clinical practice. The potential for dissemin-
ation of this psychosocial intervention is further en-
hanced by evidence showing that IPT can be delivered
effectively and with fidelity by trained facilitators who do
not necessarily have an advanced degree in psychology,
such as lay community health workers [ 99].
We considered the selection of the control group ex-
tensively. A limitation of our usual care control is that
we will not be able to account for potential confounding
effects of attention. Because adolescent patients receive
education about depression as part of prenatal usual
care, and because we seek to first establish feasibility and
acceptability, we felt that comparison to usual care was
the optimal, initial step. Depending upon the results, a
subsequent well-powered trial might include a 3-group
design comparing [ 1] IPT to [ 2] usual care and either
(3a) an attention-matched educational control or (3b) a
standard behavioral lifestyle intervention. Due to the
pilot nature of this study, one shortcoming is that we
will only have maternal insulin sensitivity and maternal/
infant adiposity at postpartum, and thus, will not be able
to control for earlier levels of these variables. These
measures are secondary outcomes, and if positive signals
are detected from these pilot data, future studies might
consider use of repeated measures of maternal metabolic
characteristics and measures at birth of infant adiposity.
Another limitation of this pilot study is that outcome as-
sessors are not blind to intervention assignment, and
thus, assessment of some outcomes may be influenced
by expectancy biases (i.e., such as those measured by
clinical interview). That being said, a potential strength
of the current study is heterogeneity of outcome vari-
ables, either by participant self-report or objective mea-
sures, such as accelerometers to assess habitual physical
activity and sleep. A subsequent randomized controlled
effectiveness trial would have the resources to ensure
that research study staff who collect outcome data are
blind to intervention assignment.
The concept of focusing on pregnant adolescents will
allow us to target an underrepresented, underserved
group who are likely to face heightened social-emotional
challenges as compared to pregnant adult women [ 35].
Opportunities to intervene with this at-risk group can be
expected to help prevent many of these young women,
and their future infants, from a lifetime trajectory ofShomaker et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:39 Page 11 of 14
obesity with its multiple adverse health consequences.
The proposed IPT intervention represents a novel ap-
proach to addressing excess GWG in adolescents by tar-
geting psychosocial risk factors including social
functioning, perceived stress, and depression symptoms.
