Feasibility of an app-based parent-
mediated speech production intervention
for minimally verbal autistic children:
development and pilot testing of a new
intervention
Jo Saul1*and Courtenay Norbury1,2
Abstract
Background: Training speech production skills may be a valid intervention target for minimally verbal autistic children.
Intervention studies have explored various approaches albeit on a small scale and with limited experimental control or
power. We therefore designed a novel app-based parent-mediated intervention based on insights from the video
modelling and cued articulation literature and tested its acceptability and usage.
Methods: Consultation with the autism community refined t he initial design and culminated in a pilot trial ( n
= 19) lasting 16 weeks. Participants were randomly all ocated an intervention duration in an AB phase design
and undertook weekly probes during baseline and intervention via the app. We evaluated the acceptability of
the intervention via feedback questionnaires and exam ined the usability variables such as adherence to the
testing and intervention schedule, time spent on the app and trials completed during the intervention phase.
Results: High acceptability scores indicated that families liked the overall goals and features of the app. Ten
participants engaged meaningfully with the app, completing 82% of the test trials and uploading data in 61%
of intervention weeks; however, of these, only three met the targeted 12.5 min of intervention per week.
Conclusion: We discuss the possible reasons for variability in usage data and how barriers to participation
could be surmounted in the future development of this intervention.
Background
Multiple risk factors interact and combine to impact lan-
guage acquisition in autism, and expressive language tra-
jectories and outcomes are highly variable for autistic
individuals. Approximately 25% of autistic individuals re-
main minimally verbal [ 1,2], which means they have
very limited ‘useful ’speech (i.e. speech used in frequent,
communicative, non-imitative and referential ways [ 3]).Development of functional speech by age 5 is one of
the strongest predictors of positive adaptive outcome in
adulthood [ 4], which has important implications for ac-
cess to opportunities in the community, quality of life
and independence. Identifying barriers to spoken lan-
guage development and tailoring interventions accord-
ingly are thus an important clinical and research aim.
Longitudinal studies have shown a host of variables to
predict expressive language in young preverbal autistic
cohorts (e.g. parent responsiveness, child joint attention
skills and communicative intent), and these findings

have informed intervention design (e.g. [ 5–7]). These
studies have shown that parent and child interactive be-
haviour may be malleable, but downstream effects of en-
hanced joint engagement on child language measures
are not always apparent.
Mounting evidence points to additional speech-motor
barriers to language development in some autistic chil-
dren [ 8,9] which could explain different predictive pat-
terns when older or more impaired cohorts are
examined [ 10–12]. Consonant inventory is a commonly
used measure of speech skills, which describes the num-
ber of different key consonants produced by the child in
a language sample. Consonant inventory has been identi-
fied as an important predictor of expressive language
growth in minimally verbal autistic children [ 12,13].
The presence of motor-speech difficulties may call for a
specific type of language intervention (e.g. in comparison
with interventions where development of joint attention
is presumed to be the underlying driver of expressive
language growth).
The evidence base for interventions focusing on
speech skills for minimally verbal autistic children is
sparse. A systematic review of communication interven-
tions for minimally verbal autistic children only identi-
fied two high-quality studies [ 14]. Only one of these
targeted spoken language, and this was via a parent-
mediated focused play therapy for 32 –82-month-olds
[15]. This intervention focussed on improving engage-
ment and broad communication goals rather than
speech skills. Approaches to improving speech produc-
tion skills directly have mainly been evaluated by case
series or small group studies, with limited power and ex-
perimental control over confounds. The majority of
these used behavioural approaches such as discrete trial
training [ 16–18], naturalistic child-led programmes [ 19]
or combinations of these with Alternative and Augmen-
tative Communication aids [ 20–22]. Non-behavioural
approaches have included music- and/or rhythm-based
techniques such as auditory-motor mapping training
[23–25] or melodic-based communication therapy [ 26]
and sensory-motor training [ 27,28]. It is difficult to
draw conclusions about the efficacy of these interven-
tions, given the lack of robust well-powered evaluations
to date. However, common themes include (1) improve-
ments in target behaviours (e.g. parent responsiveness)
without subsequent improvement in child speech pro-
duction; (2) where speech production improvements are
seen, these rarely extend beyond the target stimuli (lack
of generalisation); and (3) participants are highly hetero-
geneous in their response to interventions.
Given there is not yet an established intervention tai-
lored to improving motor speech in this population, we
sought to design and create one, with the ultimate goal
of examining the causal relationship between speechproduction skills and expressive language development.
The intervention reported in this paper employed two
techniques novel to language interventions for autistic
children: video modelling and cued articulation.
Video modelling is a technique whereby a target be-
haviour is demonstrated via a pre-recorded video played
to the learner via an electronic device, rather than
through live demonstration. The person demonstrating
the behaviour in the video (the model) can be a peer, an
adult or the learners themselves (video self-modelling).
Videos are designed to accentuate important features of
the behaviour and remove distracting extraneous stimuli,
and video modelling interventions may involve repetition
of the stimuli to enhance learning. Several meta-analyses
have concluded that video modelling can be effectively
used to promote the acquisition of a variety of academic,
social, communicative and functional skills in autistic
children and adolescents [ 29–31]. To our knowledge,
video modelling has not been investigated as a potential
tool for speech production training; however, it has been
used to promote spontaneous requesting via speech-
generating devices [ 32] in participants with a similar
profile to those in the current study.
Cued articulation [ 33] is one way of visually indicating
how a speech sound is made, for those who do not find
it easy to copy speech sounds. The rationale behind cued
articulation is that each phoneme is accompanied by a
hand gesture which provides a visual clue as to how and
where the sound is made by the articulators, for ex-
ample, a ‘p’sound starts with rounded lips that open
when the sound is released, and the ‘p’-cued articulation
gesture is index finger and thumb creating a circle which
then opens as the sound is made. Unlike manual imita-
tion, speech sound imitation cannot be physically
prompted, and because much of it occurs inside the
mouth, it can also not be viewed. Cued articulation has
rarely been tested in research studies but has been
widely used by speech and language therapists (SLTs) in
a variety of conditions including English as an additional
language, hearing impairment, autism and speech sound
disorders, despite this lack of empirical evidence [ 34].
The intervention was devised to encourage children to
practise speech sounds with a parent, in order to in-
crease their speech sound repertoire. It aimed to take
into account specific features of autism and adapt typical
approaches to speech skill training accordingly. High-
quality intervention evidence for children with speech-
motor difficulties is lacking [ 35]. Nevertheless, widely
delivered interventions frequently include (a) the
provision of high-quality multi-modal models of sounds
to be imitated and (b) facilitating frequent practice of
the sounds incorporating the principles of motor learn-
ing [ 36]. For a myriad of reasons, typical approachesSaul and Norbury Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:185 Page 2 of 17
may be problematic for autistic learners and need to be
adapted.
Repeated modelling of sounds in the natural environ-
ment is designed to draw the child ’s attention to how to
articulate a given sound, often supported by additional vis-
ual cues such as the cued articulation signs. If a child is
minimally verbal, parent-child interactions may not afford
as many natural opportunities for the parent to model the
sound. Briefly presented multisensory social input (e.g.
sound and lip movement) may be less precisely perceived
by autistic individuals [ 37]. By placing the speech sound
model in a very structured repetitive video with no dis-
tractions in the background, we hoped to reduce the at-
tentional load required to process the model.
Repeated practice is needed in order to master a spe-
cific motor skill. SLTs often achieve this by playing mo-
tivating interactive games with a child, e.g. a ‘fishing for
sounds ’game where child and therapist take turns to lift
up pretend fish with a magnet fishing rod, each fish hav-
ing a sound symbol or picture. The person has to say
the sound aloud when they have ‘fished ’it. Autistic chil-
dren may find interactive games with an unfamiliar SLT
aversive, or if learning difficulties are present, play-
related tasks could increase the cognitive demands of
the task (e.g. child struggling with fine motor aspects of
‘fishing for sounds ’game). Simplifying the task and re-
moving the interactive aspect may thus benefit autistic
children. Motivation is of course important, and it may
be possible to replace the assumed social motivation
with a child ’s special interests, to motivate them to con-
tinue with speech practice. An example would be using
video clips as a reward after attempting the target sound.
Importantly, the intervention was designed to be sim-
ple, portable and requiring no additional materials or
reporting, given that engaging children in less preferred
activities may be challenging enough for parents. It was
thus designed to be delivered via a smartphone applica-
tion (or ‘app ’). Smartphones and tablets hold much
promise as cost-effective, flexible and efficient delivery
systems for a range of educational interventions, and re-
views have demonstrated their effectiveness for autistic
learners across a host of skills [ 38–42].
Aims
The central aim of the current study was to develop and
pilot an app-based speech sound intervention for min-
imally verbal autistic children, incorporating video mod-
elling and cued articulation.
Phase 1: Intervention development
The design phase involved two stages of formative evalu-
ation, resulting in improvements to the app. The aims of
this phase were as follows:1. To seek feedback on the preliminary concept from
a focus group comprising parents of autistic
children with additional language difficulties and
incorporate it into the initial app design
2. To briefly pilot a prototype of the app with a
convenience sample and incorporate their feedback
into the version used for preliminary pilot testing
Phase 2: Preliminary pilot testing
The pilot study aimed to evaluate two important aspects
of feasibility in a sample of minimally verbal autistic
children: intervention acceptability and usability. Our
pre-registered research questions were as follows:
1. Will parents rate this intervention as acceptable?
Acceptability will be tested by simply counting the
proportion of parent-child dyads who score greater
than 24 on the parent satisfaction measure.
2. Will parent-child dyads comply with the interven-
tion to a reasonable degree? Usability will be tested
by counting the proportion of participants who
spend a mean of > 12.5 min/week on the
intervention.
We explored additional analyses to further understand
usability:
1. Did parents comply with the intervention schedule
(i.e. did they begin the intervention on time)?
2. Did parents comply with the test schedule?
3. How many intervention trials per week did the
parents do (i.e. did they spend 5 min per day
completing just one trial)?
4. Do any of the factors considered in this study
explain whether parent-child dyads were ‘high ’or
‘low’users of the app?
Finally, we aimed to collate and synthesise qualitative
feedback regarding the app ’s acceptability from parents.
Method
This section first describes the intervention used in the
pilot study, and how it was designed and modified with
autism community input (stage 1 and stage 2 of consult-
ation). In the second section, the pilot study method-
ology is described.
Phase 1: Intervention development
Design process
Our iterative intervention design process comprised the
following:
a) Initial design
b) Stage 1 consultation and app creationSaul and Norbury Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:185 Page 3 of 17
c) Stage 2 consultation and associated improvements
to the app
The app was initially designed by the authors in col-
laboration with a team from the University College
London (UCL) ’s Computer Science Department. In
March 2017, before coding for the app had begun, we
carried out stage 1 of consultation (described below).
Once a working version of the app had been created
(May 2017), we trialled it on a small convenience sample
of users (stage 2 of consultation, described below). After-
wards, an independent programmer was commissioned
to carry out the recommended changes and solve
highlighted technical problems, resulting in the proto-
type version of ‘BabbleBooster ’, which was used for the
pilot study. This version is described, followed by brief
summaries of both consultation exercises and the im-
provements that resulted.
There is a growing awareness that high-quality autism
research should directly involve autistic individuals as
partners within a participatory framework. Fletcher-
Watson et al. [ 43] advocated for ‘user-centred design
with relevant stakeholders ’in their description of the de-
sign process for an app-based intervention game de-
signed for young autistic children but discussed the
challenges of facilitating full participation by the user
group. In some cases, necessary input is sought from
family members and experts in ‘participation by proxy ’.
Given our aim to create an intervention for minimally
verbal autistic children, we engaged in participatory de-
sign with parents both during stage 1 of the consultation
and for the pilot study, as they are the principal agents
of delivering this intervention and best placed to advo-
cate for their child ’s communication needs.
BabbleBooster description
BabbleBooster was designed to deliver predictable and
repetitive speech models via video modelling and with
cued articulation. The app-play is parent-mediated, so
parents are required to watch the stimuli with their chil-
dren, encourage them to make the sound and then pro-
vide feedback on the sound in order to trigger the
reward videos. Reward videos are designed with a gradi-
ent response, so a ‘good try ’at a sound (an incorrect at-
tempt) will result in a lesser reward than an accurate
response. The families were encouraged to make or up-
load their own reward videos, based on their under-
standing of the individual child ’s specific motivators.
BabbleBooster was designed specifically for use in a
case series design, whereby each participant acts as their
own control and the outcome variable is tested repeat-
edly both before and during the intervention period.
Each participant is given a personal intervention sched-
ule comprising A (baseline) and B (intervention) weeks.BabbleBooster thus functions in one of two ‘modes ’de-
pending on whether the participant is in an A or a B
week:
/C15Test mode : this is during the baseline data collection
period. The intervention itself is not accessible, but
the test module is live. Once per week, the
participants are prompted by text message to
complete the test module.
/C15Training mode : this is during the intervention
period. Both the intervention and the test module
are live. The participants are expected to carry out
the intervention as per instructions, plus complete
the weekly test module as above.
Each participant is likely to have a unique profile of
speech skills, meaning that targets need to be individua-
lised. Nine probe phonemes were allocated to each child
at the start of the intervention by following the ‘Sound
Target Protocol ’(see Additional File 4), of which three
were allocated as intervention targets and six were con-
trols. Each week, the test module comprised nine single
trials of all nine probe speech sounds. The untrained
sounds were used as a control to compare with trained
sounds (to investigate whether there was a systematic re-
lationship between any improvement in speech produc-
tion and the intervention) and to assess whether any
improvements generalised to other sounds. Weekly test
score was calculated as a percentage, representing the
number of phonemes correctly produced out of nine.
For each of the three target speech sounds , there is a
set of learning stimuli which comprise the following:
/C15Mandatory content : this is an unchangeable content,
such as the auditory model of the sound and the
cued articulation video.
/C15Customisable content : which can be added to,
removed and changed as much as desired by the
child (with help from the parent). For example, the
app comes loaded with images of items beginning
with ‘t’for the ‘t’target (e.g. tiger), but the child may
have a favourite toy called ‘Timmy ’or a family
friend called ‘Tania ’—images of these specific items
can be transferred onto the app to create a more
meaningful personalised set of stimuli. Example
screenshots are provided in Additional File 1.
In training mode, after watching the learning stimuli,
the child is prompted to attempt the speech sound. Chil-
dren can use the video capture part of the app as a mir-
ror whilst speech attempts are being recorded and have
the opportunity to play back and review their speech at-
tempts. Parents then press one of three buttons to assign
a rating to the attempt, in accordance with Table 1.Saul and Norbury Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:185 Page 4 of 17
Depending on the parent feedback, the child is either
presented with a customisable reinforcement video as a
reward, or another attempt begins. The app records pro-
gress made by the child and determines whether mastery
criteria have been fulfilled and whether a new target can
be selected or the existing target should continue.
Figure 1depicts how a single ‘trial ’of the intervention
works.
Consultation stage 1
An initial version of the app was presented at a focus
group in March 2017 with four parents whose autistic
children have co-morbid language difficulties (referred
to as participants L, E, R and A). A fuller description of
the focus group is provided in Additional File 2. Their
input contributed to the app prototype and is briefly
summarised below.
Technology All parents reported that mobile and tablet
devices were inherently motivating for their children,
with the most commonly used function being to access
video content online (e.g. via YouTube). The content
was often esoteric, user-uploaded and specific to thechild ’s special interests (e.g. people going on waterslides,
opening toys).
Aim All liked the idea of the app and the mirror func-
tion. Parents suggested that having images which match
the sounds would make the learning more functional.
Parents would like to have input on the initial sound se-
lection process.
Time commitment All parents agreed 5 min per day is
an achievable target.
Cued articulation aspect Only participant A had heard
of this approach, but when her daughter was minimally
verbal, she had found it very helpful in progressing
speech skills.
Video modelling aspect All agreed this would be good.
Participant R said it was hard to get her son to look at
her whilst she modelled language. She believes this is
why he found PECs (a picture exchange communication
method) easier than Makaton (a simplified form of sign
language, requiring learners to copy manual signs from
adult models).Table 1 BabbleBooster parent rating buttons

Parent feedback on child productions Parents unani-
mously disliked the proposed red ‘no’button, reporting
that their children were very sensitive to ‘getting things
wrong ’. They suggested changing it to a ‘try again ’but-
ton and altering the colours.
Reinforcing videos All parents agreed that customisable
content is a must-have feature of the app. Various ways
of supporting parents to create content were discussed,
for example, providing a parent idea sheet or ‘how to ’
videos.
In summary, changes to the app from this stage of
consultation were as follows:
a) Rather than just providing the sound and a letter
symbol in the sound modelling phase, this was
changed to three images corresponding to the
sound (e.g. for ‘b’:‘baby ’,‘ball’,‘biscuit ’). These can
be replaced or exchanged by parent customisation.
b) Rather than presenting parents with three choices
for feedback buttons ( ‘yes’,‘good try ’or‘no’), this
was changed to ‘yes’,‘good try ’or‘try again ’, and
red and green colours were removed.
Consultation stage 2
A second feedback phase occurred prior to launching
the pilot study. In May 2017, a convenience sample was
invited to try the app, over the course of a week. The
group included parents of children with additional
needs, who were or had been preverbal. Due to time and
budget constraints, this convenience sample only con-
tained one parent of an autistic child. Given that the aim
of this stage was to identify technical issues rather than
shape the design, this was deemed acceptable. A fuller
description of the test phase is provided in Add-
itional File 3. This process highlighted the technical
glitches and generated further improvements to the
layout.
Summary of changes from this stage is as follows:
a) Addition of a replay button so the attempt videos
can be re-watched
b) Addition of in-app camera to take photos of stimuli
directly from the customisation menu to aid
customisation
Phase 2: Preliminary pilot testing
Participants
Participants were 19 minimally verbal autistic children
(three girls, 16 boys) who met the following criteria:
/C15Parent reported fewer than 10 sounds
/C15Parent reported fewer than 20 words/C15During observation at visit 1, fewer than five words
spoken
The children were aged 47 to 74 months at visit 1
(mean = 60, SD = 7) with a confirmed diagnosis of aut-
ism. The following exclusions were applied at the initial
screening: epilepsy; known neurological, genetic, visual
or hearing problems; and English as an additional
language.
Children were initially recruited via social media, local
charities, independent therapists and a university-run
autism participant recruitment agency, and all took part
in a larger longitudinal study [ 12]. The goal of the larger
study was to investigate predictors of expressive lan-
guage development in autistic 3 –5-year-olds who were
minimally verbal at study inception. Children were vis-
ited three times in their homes prior to the current
study (see Fig. 4). As per Fig. 2, children who remained
minimally verbal by the fourth assessment wave (visit 1
of the current study) were invited to participate in the
intervention.
Parents reported 17 participants to be White, one to
be Asian and one to be mixed race. The formal educa-
tion levels of the primary caregivers were distributed as
follows: eight completed high school, eight completed
university education and three completed post-graduate
studies or equivalent. Eighty-eight per cent of parents re-
ported that their child had an Education Health and
Care Plan, a legal document that specifies special educa-
tional support required for the child, at visit 1.
Figure 2describes the process through which partici-
pants were selected for the study.
Procedure
Children were visited in their homes by the first author
in two sessions (visit 1 and visit 2), which were separated
by 4 months each (mean = 4.0, SD = 0.3). A token of ap-
preciation (small toy or £5 voucher) was provided fol-
lowing each visit.
Atvisit 1 , each participant received a new Samsung
Galaxy Tab A6 tablet containing the app, unless parents
expressed a preference to use the app on their own An-
droid device ( n= 3). One participant received a compar-
able second-hand Nexus 7 tablet. Parents were given a
demonstration of the app by the experimenter and an
information pack explaining how to download and use
the app. The probe phonemes were selected by following
the ‘Sound Target Protocol ’(see Additional File 4), and
each parent-child dyad was informed of their randomly
allocated intervention start date. Probe phonemes are
the nine sounds that are elicited each week in the base-
line and intervention period. They also form the list
from which initial three target phonemes are drawn for
the intervention. Probe phonemes remained the sameSaul and Norbury Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:185 Page 6 of 17
for each participant throughout the study, whereas the
target phonemes for the intervention could vary over
time according to specific mastery criteria. Probe pho-
nemes were not manipulated as part of the experiment;
rather, they were a necessary feature to accommodate
the fact that each participant has a unique profile of
speech-related difficulties.
Atvisit 2 , parents completed a post-intervention ques-
tionnaire (see Additional File 5) in order to objectively
analyse the user experience of this intervention. It con-
tains a grid of 10 questions regarding the usefulness and
user-friendliness of the app, which can each score between
one and four points, generating a score ranging between
10 and 40, with 40 representing the most positive rating of
the app possible. Additionally, the questionnaire contained
four open-ended questions regarding the strengths and
weaknesses of the app.
Atboth visits , a battery of language-related measures
was taken, some of which were designed as secondary
outcome variables (parent-reported measure of expres-
sive language and an observed measure of the range of
speech sounds made during a language sample, ‘conson-
ant inventory ’) and others related to a broaderlongitudinal study (of which these visits were time points
4 and 5). As part of this battery, at visit 1, questionnaires
on AAC use and educational placement were completed.
All participants were free to take part in as much or as
little additional therapy as they chose during the study,
and this information was recorded via parent question-
naires at both visits.
Between visits 1 and 2 , text message reminders were
sent to parents to remind them of the weekly obligation
to complete the test module (a ‘probe day ’), and if neces-
sary, missed probes were rearranged for the following
day. There were 16 weeks between visits 1 and 2, and
parents were randomly allocated to one of eight possible
intervention schedules, as illustrated in Fig. 3. On the
intervention start date, parents received a reminder text.
Thereafter, parents were asked to play with the app for
5–10 min per day for 5 days a week. This resulted in
children carrying out the intervention for between 6 and
13 weeks.
Throughout the baseline and intervention period, data
from the app were uploaded regularly to a secure server
accessed by the experimenter. These data comprised the
following:Fig. 2 Recruitment flow chartSaul and Norbury Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:185 Page 7 of 17

Additionally, as the participants are drawn from a pre-
vious longitudinal study (see [ 12] for further details), fur-
ther background measures, which were gathered
between 8 and 12 months prior to the current study,
were also available to characterise the sample. A sum-
mary of all the relevant data collected (including the lar-
ger study) is provided in Fig. 4.
Measures
The background measures gathered for each participant
are summarised in Table 2.
The accessibility analysis in this paper will focus on (a)
the post-intervention questionnaire and (b) the informa-
tion on time, type and duration of app usage. Analysis of
efficacy measures such as weekly probes and pre- and
post-intervention variables is provided in [ 47]. The ran-
dom allocation of intervention schedules and repeated
probing of an outcome measure are both key compo-
nents of the study design, which is explained in greater
detail in the efficacy analysis paper [ 47].
Data analysis
Preregistered questions The analysis plan was pre-
registered on Open Science Forum at https://osf.io/
9gvbs; the acceptability and usability hypotheses were as
follows:1. Acceptability: More than half of the participants
given the intervention will rate the app favourably
via the feedback form, as defined by a score of more
than 24/40 on a 10-question feedback form, where
each question can be answered from one (not
favourable) to four (highly favourable). This hypoth-
esis will be tested by simply counting the propor-
tion of parent-child dyads who score greater than
24 on the parent satisfaction measure.
2. Usability: More than half of the participants
given the intervention will comply with the
intervention to a reasonable degree, as defined by
an average of more than 12.5 min per week
engaging with the app. This threshold was based
on the instruction for parents to spend 5 min
per day for 5 days a week using the app with
t h e i rc h i l d .T h i st o t a l sa na v e r a g eo f2 5 m i np e r
week, which would define 100% compliance.
Based on previous studies [ 48], we rated 12.5 min
per week (50% compliance) to represent the
lower threshold of ‘reasonable compliance ’.T h i s
hypothesis will be tested by counting the number
of participants who spend a mean of > 12.5 min/
week on the intervention and dividing by the
total number of participants.
Multiple other aspects of compliance were investigated
using the available data to answer the following
questions:
1. Did parents comply with the intervention schedule
(i.e. did they begin the intervention on time)? This
was evaluated by calculating the number of weeks
of delay (vs. scheduled intervention start) for each
participant.

2. Did parents comply with the test schedule? This is
important for the chosen intervention efficacy
evaluation method and was evaluated by counting
the proportion of planned weekly test trials that
took place for each participant.
3. How many intervention trials per week did the
parents do (i.e. did they spend 5 min per day
completing just one trial)? This was a mean weekly
trial count for each participant.
4. Given that the participants separated into ‘high ’
users, who provided enough test data for analysis
purposes, and ‘low’users, who completed fewer
than 4 weeks of test probes, we asked if any
background variables or other factors could explain
these groupings. This was evaluated via a series of t
tests comparing the values for each group.
Finally, feedback regarding the app from parents was
aggregated from various sources (texts, emails, written
answers to open-ended questions on the App User
Questionnaire, notes made by the first author from ver-
bal comments made by parents at visit 2 following theintervention). The first author analysed this data using
thematic analysis [ 49], in order to glean further qualita-
tive information regarding acceptability and potential av-
enues for improvement.
Results
Acceptability: parent satisfaction
The acceptability questionnaire was completed by 89%
of participants.
Table 3outlines the key characteristics of each of the
19 participants and their acceptability score. Over half of
the participants were ‘high ’users (defined as providing
greater than 66% of test trial data). Two participants
dropped out during the trial, one was lost to follow-up
and the remaining six participants engaged with the app
but not enough to produce analysable data (fewer than 4
weeks of test data and fewer than five intervention tri-
als). Of these six participants, three did not find the
technology motivating, one had ongoing health prob-
lems; one had a technical issue with the app and one
made language progress via another therapy during the

course of the intervention so did not engage with the
app.
The pre-registered hypothesis that over half of partici-
pants would assign the app an acceptability score of over
24 was confirmed. In fact, participants gave the app a
mean score of 29.5 out of 40, and only one participant
rated it below 24 (see Additional File 6for score
breakdown).
To supplement this result, we briefly summarise the
qualitative feedback gathered via feedback forms and
verbal comments made by parents at visit 2.
The overall premise and main features of the app were
well received. One parent wrote, ‘We are working on sin-
gle sound production in ad hoc way and it is good to have
a framework/system to focus us. ’Another wrote, ‘Previ-
ously have focused on whole words, this strips it back to a
more basic skill, which I think is what we need. ’
Parents reported the app was quick to do, simple and
accessible, facilitating practice little and often. Stimuli
were clear and predictable, which parents felt was a
strength. Parent quotes include that it was a ‘short fo-
cused activity that we could fit into everyday life, simple
and easy to use ’and ‘my son enjoyed the predictability ’.
Many parents reported that their children particularly
liked the video modelling stimuli.
Most parents reported that their children were specific-
ally engaged by the mirror function (being able to watch
themselves on the screen during the speech trials and hav-
ing the option to re-watch these videos, e.g. ‘the selfie as-
pect was something I had not tried previously and my
child responded well to it ’. One parent suggested that in a
future version, the videos could be side by side with the
selfie screen during practice attempts. However, for a few
parents, this feature was felt to have a negative impact in
their child ’s engagement with the app (one parent re-
ported a more general issue that their daughter had with
mirrors and asked if the mirror function could be made
optional). Another parent suggested masking the eyes as
they felt their child did not like looking at their own eyes
but would have found viewing the mouth useful.
Feedback also highlighted five main areas that could
improve acceptability:
1.Better training and support with customisation .
Although customisation was a popular feature and
reported to be easy to do, several parents said that
they found it difficult to source the customised
stimuli. This problem was compounded by the fact
that most users were not using BabbleBooster on
their ‘own ’phone and thus did not readily have
access to their own photo library and usual apps.
Several parents suggested in a future trial that we
make a library of popular videos and images. One
parent reported frustration that the app could notinterface directly with YouTube, since that was
where all her child ’s videos were and it had the
functionality that her child was used to (e.g. volume
controls, fast forward buttons).
2.Modifications to the test mode to make it more
engaging . The test mode did not have any built-in
reward videos, and many parents said this made it
difficult to engage their children, particularly as they
were first exposed to only the test mode, during the
baseline phase. Furthermore, several parents re-
ported that the probe contained too many targets
(nine), and three would have been more
manageable.
3.Solving technical problems and limitations .
Technical problems were an impediment to
participation in that for a couple of users, the app
would take a long time to initiate or would fail to
login. This made it hard to plan therapy time and
left the child and parent feeling frustrated. A few
users reported that crashes led to the need to re-
customise the stimuli, which was time-consuming.
There were reports of recordings stopping mid-
video, leading to a lack of reward and frustration.
From a research perspective, we estimate that some
data has been lost through technical faults, prevent-
ing analysis of the full dataset. For 15% of the par-
ent ratings submitted in the test phase, the
accompanying video is missing due to technical
problems. It is not possible to estimate how much
more data may have been lost due to incomplete
trials. In this trial, it was not financially feasible to
provide the app in OS (suitable for iPhones/iPads)
as well as Android format, and this had numerous
disadvantages. Two children were motivated by
technology but had aversion to the new device be-
cause it was not their usual one and did not have all
the apps they had on the other one. The new device
became linked with work/demands and thus not
motivating.
4.Introduction of more variety and visual interest in
intervention presentation . One aspect of this
feedback is similar to point 3 above: parents
requested that the app look and sound more game-
like, e.g. tones, jingles, cartoons, glitter effects, col-
ours and animations. A specific suggestion was the
incorporation of letters in the app itself (some
members of this cohort had a special interest in let-
ters). Some parents reported an initial high level of
engagement and then a fatigue effect, which was re-
vived once targets were substituted.
5.Introduction of progress feedback for parents . Many
parents stated they would like quantitative progress
feedback to encourage them to continue with the
activities, e.g. percentage of attempts that wereSaul and Norbury Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:185 Page 11 of 17
correct, minutes spent using the app and progress
towards goals.
In sum, a more ‘game-like ’app that can run on partici-
pants ’own devices and is easier to customise with a
wider range of personally relevant stimuli is a key factor
that would enhance user experience and could be imple-
mented in future trials.
Usability
In order to consider whether the second pre-registered
hypothesis can be confirmed, we have presented usage
data in Table 4.
From this table, it is apparent that only three partici-
pants used the app for longer than 12.5 min per week of
intervention (fewer than half of the expected time on
task); therefore, the hypothesis is not confirmed. Time
spent on intervention and the number of trials per week
of intervention were both highly variable.
Other usability metrics are also presented; notably,
that of the ‘high ’users, 82% of all test trials were com-
pleted, indicating that compliance with the test element
of the trial was good in this subgroup. It was also not
time-consuming, taking a mean of 6.6 min to complete
per week. Adherence to the intervention schedule was
also reasonable at 61%, with a mean delay to starting of
1.4 weeks.
Characteristics of the ‘high ’user group
Given that approximately half of the participants en-
gaged successfully with the app to some degree ( n= 10),and nine participants did not, we present an exploratory
side by side analysis of group characteristics in Table 5,
to explore whether background characteristics like fam-
ily socio-economic status or child symptom severity in-
fluenced the use of the app. This analysis also
highlighted the limited amount of special clinical ser-
vices these families were receiving, on average fewer
than 2 h per week. The total therapy hours/week vari-
able is skewed by one high value (57 h vs. mean of 1.3 h/
week for all other participants).
Discussion
This is an acceptable intervention as judged by the pre-
registered analysis of post-intervention questionnaires.
Qualitative results reveal strengths in the study and app
design and areas for further development that largely
focus on solving technical issues and ease of customisa-
tion and gamification. This finding indicates that the
app intervention has numerous features which parents
and children liked and fostered engagement, and it has
potential for future development.
Usage figures, however, presented a more mixed picture.
Participants polarised into those who engaged with the
app to a minimal degree ( n= 9) and those who adhered
well to the test schedule ( n= 10). Of these 10 children,
intervention usage figures were highly variable (in minutes
spent and trials per week), but reasonable overall adher-
ence to the intervention schedule was observed. Due to
the unique features of this intervention, it is difficult to
compare these usage figures to others in the literature.

to be evaluated on criteria such as training session attend-
ance [ 50] or how many learnt strategies are employed by
parents at subsequent observations (e.g. [ 51]). App-based
autism interventions are usually designed to be independ-
ently accessed by users (e.g. [ 52]). The shared app-play
here resembles more closely the off-line ‘homework ’allo-
cated by speech-language therapists for children with
speech sound disorders; however, the developmental and
behavioural profile of children in this cohort is more chal-
lenging. A useful comparator is [ 53] which describes a
feasibility trial of an app-based parent communication
training for children with motor and communication dis-
orders. Parents were required to upload and annotate vid-
eos of themselves interacting with their child at regular
intervals and received remote coaching on their use of key
strategies. The attrition rate was 44%, and participation
levels fell short of the target (target = 39 sessions, median
= 26, range = 5 –33). Parents reported that they found the
intervention useful but cited time pressures and technical
problems amongst reasons for lower engagement.
Many who found the app acceptable still dropped out
or engaged only minimally, and it is important to con-
sider the reasons why this happened.
This was a pilot study run on a minimal budget,
and consequently, numerous practical challenges were
encountered, particularly in resolving technical diffi-
culties. Loss of data and frustration leading to avoid-
ance also explains why some children and families
were minimal users. We believe that these problems
would be surmountable if a professional app company
were to be engaged. This pilot has highlighted the
importance of having enough memory capacity on the
chosen device, which must be weighed up against cost
considerations for any future trial. A lack of cross-
platform approach led to limitations in device choice;
without a doubt, using participants ’own phones
would have been more effective. In a future trial, we
would strongly recommend a cross-platformapproach, so that participants can use their own
devices.
Thematic analysis of qualitative feedback received
from parents highlighted several key areas for improve-
ment. Parents reported that additional support with cus-
tomisation would be beneficial. Some of the difficulties
stemmed from parents not using their usual devices for
the intervention (due to the need to use a specific an-
droid device). This meant that they did not have direct
access to their personal photo libraries. We had posited
that with cloud-based file repositories and online access
to limitless content (e.g. YouTube or Google Images),
this would not be problematic; however, it appears to
have influenced the degree of customisation which took
place. The only official gauge of how much customisa-
tion occurred is by measuring minutes spent on the cus-
tomising screen; however, this gives a limited impression
of how much the stimuli were changed. In a future trial,
we would recommend the data capture to give more de-
tailed information of this or that parents record their
customisation activities in a diary format. In addition, a
library feature and better interfaces with popular video
sharing apps would enhance the usability for parents, al-
though a preliminary feedback exercise may be necessary
to ascertain which content would appeal to users.
A second area for improvement was the need for
gamification, particularly with the test module, which
parents found less engaging than the intervention. Over-
all, the test phase was a stumbling block for many users
and could have been responsible for several of the par-
ticipants dropping out or not adhering to the interven-
tion. It comprised nine probes, which parents suggested
was too many. This number was chosen to provide
enough items to demonstrate any improvement within
participant over time, incorporating trained and un-
trained items. It was designed to be a ‘cold probe ’in
order to provide evidence of an improvement in the tar-
get skill if there was one; therefore, no feedback wasTable 5 Descriptive statistics describing the demographic features of the high vs. low user groups

provided on speech attempts. An improvement would
be to incorporate non-contingent rewards into the test
phase, in order to ensure the children ’s first exposure to
the app was associated with the fun aspects that appear
later in the intervention phase (i.e. reward videos). As
BabbleBooster was a low-budget prototype, there was lit-
tle scope to ‘gamify ’the app by incorporating visual ef-
fects such as spinning images and sound effects, but
these may have also helped engage children from the
outset.
Gamification of the intervention trials was also called
for by parents. This would be a key area for refinement if
this app is developed further. Amongst potential solutions
are to intersperse targets with mastered items (although
this may have to be a non-speech task depending on the
children ’s ability level) or to have more targets but rotate
them frequently, perhaps at the syllable level so instead of
just working on ‘b’,w o r ko n ‘bee ’,‘boo ’and ‘bah ’.T h e
need to individualise and differentiate activities is com-
m o ni na p p - a s s i s t e da u t i s mi n t e r v e n t i o n s[ 54].
The final recommendation from parents was to in-
corporate a feedback mechanism, in order to inform and
motivate families during the intervention. This was an
initially planned feature that had to be disabled in the
final version of the app due to cost constraints (a
reworking of the app by the independent developer to
resolve technical issues identified at stage 2 had caused
the feedback mechanism to stop working, and no further
funds were available to reinstate it). In future trials, this
should be reinstated.
Parents of autistic children experience higher levels of
stress [ 55–57], and thus, fitting an additional therapy
task into daily life could also be challenging. The occur-
rence of family illness, carer chronic health conditions,
siblings with additional needs and difficult transition pe-
riods between educational settings and school holidays
were amongst the many barriers to adherence faced by
this cohort. Parent-mediated speech and language ther-
apy is often suggested, and digital tools such as Babble-
Booster are designed to make this more feasible;
however, we must be realistic that even this will be too
much for some families, given their circumstances. Rela-
tively few studies have analysed parent intervention ad-
herence in families with a minimally verbal autistic child
(e.g. [ 58]), and this is crucial to understanding what
intervention approaches are likely to enhance parent co-
operation.
Finally, we should recognise that app-based therapy is
also not for everybody and that is especially true in this
very heterogeneous group. Three of the children ’s fam-
ilies reported that they were just not interested in tech-
nical devices. In these cases, future studies could
consider whether the principles of the intervention de-
sign could be applied through different media. Animprovement for future studies could be to evaluate
technology use, familiarity and preferences amongst par-
ticipants (parents and children) prior to an app trial. In
the case of this study, children were recruited from a lar-
ger longitudinal study using pre-registered inclusion cri-
teria, which did not include information regarding
technology preferences, although the information mate-
rials available to parents as part of the consent process
did explain that the intervention would be app-based.
This study was not adequately powered to examine as-
sociations between background measures and ‘high ’/‘low ’
group membership. Future studies could test these rela-
tionships or seek to identify other factors which could
be important predictors of intervention compliance in
this population, such as parent physical and mental
health, employment, confidence in using technology or
delivering therapy.
Considering the challenges identified above, a future
trial could improve the technological and motivational
aspects of the app. It is also possible that asking other
significant adults (such as grandparents, learning support
assistants) to use the app with the child in different set-
tings could be an acceptable solution, in families where
adherence to intervention is not feasible. More detailed
predictions could be made regarding usability metrics,
and data should be collected on customisation activities,
in order to gauge whether the degree of engagement
with customisation was a factor in subsequent accept-
ability and usage scores.
Limitations
Like many feasibility studies, we evaluated participant
satisfaction using a bespoke questionnaire, tailored to
the key components of the intervention (e.g. [ 59,60]).
There are thus no appropriate benchmarks or norms
available for our acceptability measure. Future studies
could combine our highly informative bespoke measure
with a commonly used generic intervention evaluation
measure such as the Behaviour Intervention Rating Scale
(BIRS; [61]). The BIRS is a 24-item inventory using a 6-
point Likert-type scale ( ‘strongly disagree ’to ‘strongly
agree ’) and addresses acceptability and perceived effi-
cacy. Equally, the pre-determined threshold to assess ac-
ceptability on this measure of 24/40 was set arbitrarily,
whereas if a generic evaluation measure had been used,
the threshold could be more robustly justified and com-
pared with other studies.
Secondly, no fidelity measures were taken during the
parent training aspect of this study (e.g. checklists of
training topics or video coded analysis of parent training
session). This was deemed unnecessary given the simpli-
city of the app and provision of a detailed manual, but it
may be useful in a future study. Finally, thematic analysis
of qualitative feedback from parents was evaluatedSaul and Norbury Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:185 Page 14 of 17
subjectively by the first author alone. In future studies,
an experimenter from outside the study could gather
qualitative feedback using semi-structured interviews in
order to reduce bias, and themes derived from tran-
scribed interviews could be reviewed by another experi-
menter to ensure convergence.
The study aimed to incorporate user-centred design into
the creation of the app, via a focus group (consultation
stage 1). This phase did not lead to significant changes to
the app, yet a wealth of proposed changes resulted from
the pilot. This may suggest an ineffective consultation
process, perhaps it was not done in sufficient depth or at
the right time in the design process. These aspects were
constrained by the timeline and budget for the study.
Some aspects in need of improvement (such as technical
problems which only became apparent after several weeks
of video downloading) could not have come to light until
the app was in daily use.
Conclusion
This study reports a first attempt to develop and pilot a cus-
tomisable app to develop speech production skills in minim-
ally verbal autistic children, using video modelling and cued
articulation to demonstrate where and how speech sounds
were made, and video capture to record the child ’sp r o d u c -
tion efforts. Overall, parents reported that a structured focus
on improving speech skills was welcome and reported that
the app and the intervention design were acceptable. Never-
theless, parent compliance wit h the intervention schedule
was highly variable and parents delivered about half of the
recommended trials. Whilst tec hnical issues with software
and device may explain some of this, the demands of family
life may make parent-mediated interventions more challen-
ging for this population. A better understanding of how best
to facilitate engagement in therapies is a priority for future
research. Future research should aim to leverage the valuable
lessons learned in the current study, in order to further de-
velop and test app-based interventions for this hard-to-reach
and underserved population. In particular, future work
should investigate the impacts o f duration, frequency and in-
tensity for app-based speech interventions.
