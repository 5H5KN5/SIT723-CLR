Abstract 
Background: Sub‑Saharan Africa (SSA) is heavily burdened by HIV, with 85% of the global new infections among 
adolescents happening in the region. With advances in medication and national policies promoting antiretroviral 
therapy (ART), children < 15 years living with HIV (CLWH) continue to grow with a chronic, highly stigmatized disease. 
Unfortunately, the stigma they experience results in much lower quality of life, including poor mental health and 
treatment outcomes. Family members also experience stigma and shame by virtue of their association with an HIV ‑
infected family member. Yet, stigma‑reduction interventions targeting CLWH and their families are very limited. The 
goal of this study is to address HIV ‑associated stigma among CLWH and their caregivers in Uganda.
Methods: This three ‑arm cluster randomized control trial, known as Suubi4Stigma, will evaluate the feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary impact of two evidence ‑based interventions: (1) group cognitive behavioral therapy 
(G‑CBT) focused on cognitive restructuring and strengthening coping skills at the individual level and (2) a multiple 
family group (MFG) intervention that strengthens family relationships to address stigma among CLWH (N = 90, 10–14 
years) and their families (dyads) in Uganda. Nine clinics will be randomized to one of three study arms (n = 3 clinics, 
30 child‑ caregiver dyads each): (1) usual care; (2) G‑ CBT + usual care; and (3) MFG + usual care. Both treatment and 
control conditions  will be delivered over a 3‑month period. Data will be collected at baseline (pre ‑intervention) and 
at 3 months and 6 months post ‑intervention initiation.
Conclusion: The primary aim of the proposed project is to address the urgent need for theoretically and empirically 
informed interventions that seek to reduce HIV ‑associated stigma and its negative impact on adolescent health and 
psychosocial well‑being. As several countries in SSA grapple with care and support for CLWH, this study will lay the 
foundation for a larger intervention study investigating how HIV ‑associated stigma can be reduced to foster healthy 
child development—especially for CLWH as they transition through adolescence.

Introduction
Globally, an estimated 1.8 million children < 15 years are 
living with HIV [1, 2]. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is heav -
ily burdened by HIV, with 85% of new infections among 
adolescents happening in the region [2]. Uganda is one 
of 7 countries in SSA to achieve the 90-90-90 testing, 
treatment, and viral suppression targets [2, 3]. However, 
even with these improvements, HIV prevalence is still 
high (7.5%) among people between 15 and 49 years [4]. 
Moreover, close to 150,000 children (ages 0–14) were liv -
ing with HIV in 2019 [2]. While availability and access to 
free antiretroviral therapy (ART) have decreased child 
mortality [5], such accomplishment has resulted in the 
likelihood that more children living with HIV (CLWH) 
will transition into adulthood with HIV, a chronic, highly 
stigmatized illness [6]. Unfortunately, the stigma they 
experience results in a lower quality of life. However, very 
few stigma-reduction interventions targeting CLWH and 
their families exist in SSA [7, 8]. Thus, there is a need for 
data driven research to address stigma, especially among 
CLWH as they transition through adolescence into young 
adulthood.
HIV‑related stigma and associated outcomes
Among people living with HIV (PLWH), stigma is a com -
mon experience characterized by public blame and moral 
condemnation for contracting the infection [9–11]. It 
perpetuates a culture of silence and fear and prevents 
individuals from testing and seeking health care [9]. 
Stigma can be internalized as a result of perceived nega -
tive public attitudes. It translates into feelings that the self 
is reprehensible, damaged and defective; and is associ -
ated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorders 
(PTSD) [12, 13], feelings of loneliness and social isolation 
[14, 15], poor treatment and adherence to medication [10, 
16], poor HIV-related physical health [17], and increased 
sexual risk-taking behavior [18]. Moreover, internalized 
stigma increases the risk of loss to treatment follow up 
[19]. Public stigma is manifested by the general popula -
tion through negative stereotypes such as those related 
to sexual behaviors, prejudice (fear, aversion, hatred), and 
discrimination, all of which create social barriers, includ -
ing access to healthcare [20]. Moreover, many CLWH live 
with extended family members after losing their parents 
to HIV, where stigma is perpetuated through rejection, 
verbal insults, physical abuse, avoidance and ostracism 
due to unfounded fears of infection [21].
At the family level, family members are often con -
demned and stigmatized in similar ways, by virtue of 
their association with an HIV infected family mem -
ber [22, 23]. Stigma at the family level may be mani -
fested through gossip, name calling, rejection and social isolation, loss of social support, and harassment 
[22, 23]. Specifically, family members are often held 
accountable for not preventing the perceived “immoral 
behaviors” of the HIV-infected family member, leading 
to feelings of failure, anger, guilt, and shame [22]. Such 
feelings negatively affect family caregiving roles, fam -
ily functioning, and HIV health outcomes for PLWH, 
including CLWH. Due to this environment, CLWH may 
miss developing strong attachment bonds with family 
members and fail to develop self-esteem, emotional, 
and behavioral regulations [24]. Such unsupportive 
social environments increase the risk for mental dis -
orders, including depression, stress, and anxiety [25]. 
Therefore, it is critical to develop HIV stigma reduction 
interventions to improve life satisfaction, family func -
tioning, and reduce the potential spread of HIV.
Potential role of family members in addressing 
HIV‑associated stigma
Adolescence is a period of multiple vulnerabilities 
marked by the onset of physical and emotional matu -
ration accompanied by the challenges of adapting to 
social, emotional, and cognitive changes [26]. Hence, 
children need additional support, including emotional 
support and acceptance from family and community 
members. Yet, many CLWH cannot count on the “nor -
mal” transition to adolescence due to HIV-associated 
stigma where community and family members ostra -
cize them for being HIV positive [27], and where fam -
ily members suffer the same treatment due to having 
a CLWH in the family [22, 23]. Thus, understanding 
the role of family members, and involving them in the 
design and implementation of family level HIV-related 
programs and interventions for CLWH is essential to 
their success.
The protective role of families in influencing children’s 
behavior and mental health outcomes has been well doc -
umented [28]. Studies have shown that quality of fam -
ily relationships predict child mental health functioning 
and overall adjustment, and that when families are con -
sistently involved in children’s lives, children experience 
a more positive transition through adolescence [29, 30]. 
Parental skills have been associated with children’s psy -
chological adjustment, less risky sexual behavior, and less 
susceptibility to peer pressure [31, 32]. Moreover, more 
frequent and open communication with parents is asso -
ciated with better psychological adjustment [33, 34]. Yet, 
for CLWH, parent-child communication and involve -
ment may be adversely affected by orphanhood and HIV-
associated stigma. Therefore, family support strategies 
may strengthen family functioning and help to address 
individual and family-level stigma.

Need for HIV stigma reduction interventions targeting 
CLWH
While the negative impacts of HIV-associated stigma 
have been well-documented, systematic reviews have 
found that stigma reduction interventions for CLWH in 
SSA are almost non-existent [7, 8]. Existing interventions 
focus on reducing fear of HIV infection among non-
infected populations [8] as they interact with PLWH. For 
example, of the 48 stigma reduction interventions, only 
3 aimed to reduce stigma among PLWH in SSA [35, 36]. 
None targeted CLWH, nor assessed the impact of stigma 
reduction on HIV-related outcomes. To address these 
gaps, this pilot trial, entitled “Suubi4Stigma” (also known 
as Hope for Stigma in Luganda local language), seeks to 
address the urgent need for innovative, theoretically, 
and empirically informed interventions to reduce HIV-
associated stigma and its negative impact on adolescent 
health and psychosocial well-being. This study examines 
two evidence-based interventions used in mental health 
settings, schools, and communities: (1) group cognitive 
behavior therapy (G-CBT) focuses on cognitive restruc -
turing and strengthening coping skills at the individual 
level; and (2) a multiple family group (MFG) intervention 
that strengthens family relationships to address stigma 
among CLWH and their families. The specific aims are 
the following:
Aim 1
Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
impact of G-CBT and MFG on reducing HIV-associated 
(internalized and family level) stigma, and its impact 
on adolescent and family outcomes (trauma symp -
toms, depression, sexual risk, family/social support and 
adherence to medication) compared to: (a) usual care vs 
G-CBT; (b) usual care vs MFG; (c) G-CBT vs. MFG.
Aim 2
Qualitatively examine participants’ and facilitators’ inter -
vention experiences and identify individual, family, and institutional-level facilitators and barriers to G-CBT and 
MFG intervention implementation and participation.
The Suubi4Stigma study has been designed as a three-
arm cluster randomized control trial (RCT), consisting 
of a control arm and two treatment arms. Assessments 
will be conducted at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months 
post-intervention initiation.
Theoretical framework
This study is informed by the HIV stigma framework 
[37, 38] suggesting that HIV stigma impacts PLWH via 
distinct HIV stigma mechanisms of internalized, antici -
pated, and enacted HIV stigma. Anticipated and enacted 
HIV stigma involve experiences with others [38]. Inter -
nalized stigma—the focus of this study—involves endors -
ing negative feelings and beliefs associated with HIV and 
applying them to the self. In addition, family members 
of PLWH are also subjected to and experience stigma by 
association via similar mechanisms. Within this frame -
work, MFG provides opportunities for caregivers and 
children to communicate in a safe setting. It focuses on 
addressing internalized and family-level stigma by nor -
malizing shared experiences with other families, foster -
ing peer support and family communication, facilitating 
optimism and morale, and enhancing interpersonal and 
coping skills [39].
On the other hand, G-CBT addresses internalized 
stigma through the core components of psychoeducation, 
cognitive restructuring, and skill-building to increase 
adaptive coping mechanisms [40]. These mechanisms 
may impact a range of psychological, behavioral, and 
health outcomes for CLWH and their families (Fig. 1).
Methods
The Suubi4Stigma study is a three-arm cluster RCT 
evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
impact of G-CBT versus MFG interventions among, 90 
CLWH (10–14 years) and their caregivers (dyads). Nine 
clinics will be randomized to one of three study arms 
Fig. 1 Conceptual model
Page 4 of 14 Nabunya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:95 
(n = 3 clinics, 30 child-caregiver dyads each): (1) usual 
care; (2) G-CBT + usual care; and (3) MFG + usual care. 
Both treatment and control arms will be delivered over a 
3-month period. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-
intervention), 3 months, and 6 months post-intervention 
initiation (Fig. 2).
Study setting
The study will be implemented in the greater Masaka 
Region of Uganda. The region is composed of seven 
political districts: Rakai, Masaka, Lwengo, Kalungu, 
Lyantonde, Kyotera, and Bukomansimbi, and has the 
highest HIV prevalence compared to the national average 
[3, 4]. Child-caregiver dyads will be recruited from health 
clinics where the Washington University’s International 
Center for Child Health and Development (ICHAD) 
that houses the study and Reach the Youth (RTY), our 
implementation partner, operate. For a health clinic to be 
included in the study, it will have to be credited by the 
Uganda Ministry of Health to provide ART and have ado -
lescent friendly services (e.g., adolescent days).
Study participants
A total of 90 CLWH and their caregivers (dyads) enrolled 
in care at a health clinic that has partnered with ICHAD 
and RTY will be recruited into the study. Child inclusion criteria are: (1) living with HIV and know their status, 
(2) prescribed ART, (3) living within a family (defined 
broadly—not necessarily with biological parents), and 
(4) between 10 and 14 years. All eligible children from a 
particular household will be enrolled in the study and will 
be assigned to the same study condition. In addition, car -
egivers of children who agree to participate in the study 
will be enrolled. If the caregiver chooses to withdraw 
from the study, the child will also be asked to withdraw 
from the study. Children and caregivers will be excluded 
if they are unable to comprehend the informed consent/
assent process and study expectations or unwilling to 
complete study activities. A complete timeline of project 
activities is presented in Table 1.
Clinic randomization
Stratified random sampling will be utilized to assign 
health care clinics to two strata based on health clinic 
level (health center III vs health center IV) to ensure over -
all clinic balance across study arms. Per the 2019 Uganda 
Ministry of Health’s Guidelines for Health Center Health 
Unit Management Committees (http:// libra ry. health. go.  
ug/ publi catio ns/ health- infra  struc  ture), Health Center 
III is amid level care with provisions for basic laboratory 
services for diagnosis, maternity care and inpatient care 
with first level referral cover to the subcounty. It is usually

staffed by nurse aids, qualified nurses and clinical officers. 
Health Center IV on the other hand, is a higher-level pri -
mary care facility below the district hospital, staffed with 
a medical doctor, with provisions for operating theater, 
inpatient and laboratory services and receives referrals 
from lower-level health facilities. All clinics offer HIV 
services. Each clinic will be randomly assigned to one of 
the three study arms, such that all selected child-caregiver 
dyads in the same clinic receive the same intervention, 
to reduce contamination. Randomization of clinics will 
be done by an independent research associate based at 
Washington University in St. Louis, using STATA soft -
ware. Each health clinic’s assignment to a study condition 
will remain blinded to other study participants and facili -
tators, with the exception of research assistants, Project 
Coordinator and MPIs.
Recruitment, retention, and attrition
Recruitment procedures tested in our previous stud -
ies will be utilized [41]. Children will be identified and 
recruited from health clinics associated with RTY and 
ICHAD. Patients are seen at least annually and each 
patient on ART must have prescriptions filled monthly 
at each of the health clinics. Although appointment days 
(not times) are provided, most patients arrive early in 
the morning on days that are convenient for them and 
wait for several hours before they are seen, providing 
an opportunity for recruitment through medical staff. A 
list of all eligible families will be created from medical 
records by one of the medical staff. Each chart contains 
data on the patient’s HIV status, age, and family. A clinic 
staff member will review the daily schedule, noting the 
eligibility of patients. Providers will present the project to 
adult caregivers of eligible children during appointments. 
If caregivers are interested, verbal consent to be con -
tacted by research staff (who will be on-site during clinic 
days) will be requested. After speaking with the research 
staff one-on-one about the study, interested caregivers 
will provide written consent for themselves and for their 
child to participate. Children will be asked to provide 
written assent separately to avoid coercion.
The Suubi4Stigma study will take place in a highly sta -
ble region where geographical moves are rare, facilitat -
ing the ability to track and retain the sample. Retention 
procedures used in our previous Suubi studies will be 
utilized [41–43]. Specifically, we will ask participants to 
give their telephone number (if they have one), names, 
addresses, and contact information for three people who 
will always know how to reach them. Participants will be 
told that if we contact the people listed, we will not dis -
cuss any details about them or their study participation. 
We will use these records to help track their location only 
if we have lost contact. In addition, we will have monthly contact with children in both treatment conditions dur -
ing MFG and G-CBT intervention delivery. This frequent 
contact will enable the research team to continually 
engage all participants and minimize loss to follow-up. 
Based on prior studies in the same region, we conserva -
tively expect attrition by end of the 2-year study to be no 
more than 10% [43, 44].
Suubi4Stigma study arms
Control arm (usual care)
All participants in both control and treatment arms will 
receive the traditional clinic intervention that focuses on 
testing services, as well as medical and treatment support 
for PLWH, including children and adolescents [45]. Cur -
rently, patients coming to the clinics receive testing and 
ART treatment as well as information about disease man -
agement. Both children and caregivers will receive this 
information. All participants in both control and treat -
ment arms will receive medical and psychosocial support 
as part of usual care.
Treatment arm 1 (G‑CBT)
In addition to usual care, participants in this arm 
will receive 10 sessions of G-CBT for HIV-associated 
stigma. Within G-CBT for stigma, we will utilize core 
components of CBT, such as psychoeducation, cogni -
tive restructuring, and skill-building to increase adap -
tive coping mechanisms [40]: (1) exploration of HIV’s 
role and impact of stigma in adolescents’ lives; (2) use of 
cognitive restructuring to identify and address the nega -
tive stigma-associated beliefs, loss of self-esteem, and 
self-blame; and (3) skills-building around stress manage -
ment and emotion-focused coping strategies to address 
negative feelings (e.g., assertiveness, relaxation skills and 
problem solving skills) [46]. G-CBT will be facilitated by 
trained para-counselors with experience in mental health 
support and working with children and adolescents liv -
ing with HIV in the study region. Caregivers will not 
participate in G-CBT. Sessions will be delivered twice a 
week, outside of school hours and will be delivered in the 
Luganda local language. G-CBT is likely to offer more 
opportunities for normalization, positive peer modeling, 
reinforcements, social support, and exposure to social 
situations and feedback sources, given the context of 
shared experiences [47].
Treatment arm 2 (MFG)
The MFG intervention is rooted in family systems theory, 
structural family theory and social learning theory with 
elements of psychoeducation and social group work. 
MFG is a family-centered, group-delivered, evidence-
informed, strength-based 10-session intervention for 
adolescents whose families struggle with poverty and 
Page 6 of 14 Nabunya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:95 
associated stressors [39]. MFG integrates components 
of existing evidence-based practices that successfully 
improve parental management, mental health promot -
ing family processes, and family strengthening [48, 49]. 
Specific session content will draw on the current inter -
ventions implemented by ICHAD [42, 50]. Sessions will 
focus on the core components of MFG, also known as 
4Rs and 2S’s (rules, responsibility, relationships, respect -
ful communication, stress, and social support). Families 
(children and caregivers) will be combined into groups 
of no more than 10 families each to promote commu -
nication and support within and among families. Ses -
sions will be delivered in the Luganda local language, 
will last approximately 1 h and will be delivered twice a 
week, outside of school hours. Given the significant and 
protective role families play in children and adolescents’ 
health and mental health, we expect that strengthening 
family functioning and dialogue by involving caregivers 
through MFG will lead to better child outcomes, includ -
ing addressing HIV-associated stigma.
Intervention adaptation, delivery, monitoring, and fidelity
We will engage stakeholders, including implementing 
partners, community health care workers and peer par -
ents already trained in the delivery on MFG sessions 
[42, 50], as well as in-country mental health workers 
and community leaders, and para-counselors, who will 
deliver G-CBT sessions. In Uganda, para-counselors are 
trained to assist with the psychological needs of indi -
viduals, including those related to HIV/AIDS and men -
tal health [51, 52]. Specifically, while counselors undergo 
both generic and specialty training, para-counselors 
acquire basic general counseling and can offer basic help 
as they organize for a referral to the professional. They 
will participate in a 5-day training and receive monthly 
group supervision. Adaptation of G-CBT content, includ -
ing cultural adaptation, will be ensured by intensive con -
sultative meetings with the aforementioned stakeholders. 
During the consultative meetings, stakeholders will be 
introduced to the study and the core components of 
G-CBT for stigma, review manual/session content devel -
oped by the research team (based on a review of existing 
literature and CBT manuals utilized in Uganda and other 
settings), provide feedback on session content and cul -
tural relevance, and make final revisions to the manual. 
The research team will ensure: (1) content adaptation of 
the materials to address stigma associated with mental 
illness to the context of HIV/AIDS-associated stigma, 
(2) developmental and cognitive adaptation of the con -
tent for children between 10 and 14 years, and (3) cul -
tural adaptation of the G-CBT to local context. Content 
will be tailored to match children’s ability to comprehend 
and implement the therapeutic techniques, including age-appropriate activities, child friendly materials, sim -
plified language and visuals (e.g., cartoons) [53], less 
complex behavioral techniques, and more support, struc -
ture and feedback [46]. In addition, the cultural adap -
tation is intended to enhance its treatment relevance, 
credibility, efficacy, and effectiveness by aligning it to the 
socioeconomic situation, cultural beliefs, family, political, 
and health systems in the region [54, 55].
For MFG, parent peers (n = 6) and community health 
workers (n = 6) already trained in MFG delivery focused 
on child behavioral health [42, 43, 50] will be invited to 
participate and receive a refresher training focused on 
Suubi4Stigma’s new content. Sessions focused on HIV 
and stigma will be adapted from curriculum used in our 
previous HIV-focused studies and resources from the 
Ministry of Health [41, 53]. The protocols have been 
designed to provide opportunities during each session 
to directly apply content to the realities of family life, 
emergent cultural and values perspectives, as well as tai -
lor messages to age of child [43, 56]. These will include 
group activities, role plays, sharing experiences, and fam -
ily take home activities. During MFG implementation, 
facilitators will receive 2 h per month of group supervi -
sion across sites.
Implementation process evaluation
Process measures will be used to monitor fidelity and 
intervention implementation. For intervention delivery 
fidelity, independent observations (by trained research 
staff) using fidelity checklists will be made with a random 
sample of 60% of intervention sessions for both G-CBT 
and MFG. These data will be used to assess: (1) the rela -
tionship between planned and actual implementation; (2) 
integrity of implementation; and (3) how sessions were 
altered to maximize effectiveness and acceptability. In 
addition, having two facilitators per group will allow for 
detailed process notes on the implementation process 
and balancing “fidelity” and “fit” to local culture. Group 
participants will report monthly on factors that affect 
their participation using an implementation checklist 
that assesses satisfaction and obstacles to program deliv -
ery: (1) factors interfering with child  or family partici -
pation (e.g., time, other priorities, stigma); (2) concrete 
obstacles (e.g., weather, transportation); and (3) site and 
staffing obstacles (e.g., time constraints).
Quantitative data collection
Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 
months post-intervention initiation from both children 
and caregivers (see Table  2 for assessment measures). 
Interviewer administered interviews will be conducted 
by a trained research assistant at each clinic (in a private 
location) and take approximately 60–90 min with breaks 
Page 7 of 14
 Nabunya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:95 
 
and will be administered in Luganda, the local language 
widely spoken in the study region. Assessments will be 
translated and back translated into the local language by 
a certified translator.
Qualitative data collection
Our qualitative methods are informed by an interpretive 
approach that examines the experiences and practices of 
participants and their subjective meaning making pro -
cesses [76]. Two sets of qualitative interviews with par -
ticipants (children and caregivers) in the two treatment 
arms (G-CBT and MFG) will be conducted. The first set 
will be conducted at baseline to explore participants’ 
experiences with HIV-related stigma and its perceived 
impact on their lives and family wellbeing. The second 
interview will be conducted upon intervention comple -
tion to obtain feedback on intervention acceptability and 
relevance. Specifically, these interviews will (1) explore 
participants’ intervention experiences and perceived 
impact of the intervention on change mechanisms and 
(2) identify multi-level facilitators and barriers to G-CBT and MFG intervention, implementation, and participa -
tion. Our interview guides will be informed by the HIV 
stigma framework and the acceptability and appropriate -
ness concepts developed by Proctor et al. to explore per -
ceptions of intervention acceptability and impact [76]. 
The interviews will provide rich data on processes and 
experiences with the program; processes behind key out -
comes, mechanisms of change, and mediating variables; 
and potential individual, family, contextual, program -
matic, and structural factors affecting their experiences. 
Dyads with the highest, medium, and lowest scores on 
the stigma measures [66, 67, 73] in two treatment arms (6 
clinics) will be identified at following baseline. Two fami -
lies within each of these groups in the 6 treatment clinics 
will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews (2 
× 3 × 6 = 36 dyads). This sampling method will ensure 
that participants with varying experiences are repre -
sented. This will allow us to identify common patterns 
and variations in participants’ experiences. The sample 
size will be sufficient for theoretical saturation [77, 78], 
and will allow for identification of common patterns and/Table 2 Assessment table

all facilitators will be interviewed to gain a deeper under -
standing of implementation patterns and processes, 
including their views on sustainability. Interviews will 
be conducted in English or Luganda. Questions will be 
translated/back translated by two team members fluent

Quantitative measures and analyses
Feasibility
We will monitor recruitment rates and staff level of 
effort, number of screenings conducted, as well as pro -
portion eligible and agreed to enroll. Enrollment of 70% 
or higher will be considered feasible [79]. We will record 
the number of rescheduled, cancelled and missed G-CBT 
and MFG sessions, as well as assessments to inform esti -
mation of staffing needs and retention protocols for a 
subsequent trial. We will also monitor attrition at each 
data collection point.
Acceptability
We will adapt satisfaction surveys, e.g., the Client Sat -
isfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), to assess acceptabil -
ity [80]. Some of the items include: “How satisfied were 
you with the program?” , “How helpful was the program 
in addressing HIV-associated stigma?” and “How likely 
are you to recommend this program to other families 
with CLWH?” Given the modest sample size, quantitative 
analyses of intervention data will be largely descriptive 
and concentrate on tabulating and summarizing satisfac -
tion outcomes.
Preliminary impact
We expect that: H1: Following the intervention, relative 
to the control arm, participants in both treatment arms 
(G-CBT and MFG) will have: H1a: lower mean count of 
children reporting HIV-associated stigma; H1b: lower 
mean levels of reported HIV-associated stigma and 
improved child psychosocial functioning; H1c: lower 
mean levels of reported child mental health challenges; 
and H1d: higher mean levels of treatment adherence. H2: 
Following intervention, relative to the G-CBT interven -
tion arm, participants in the MFG intervention arm will 
have: H2a: lower mean count of children reporting HIV-
associated stigma; H2b: lower mean levels of reported 
HIV-associated stigma and improved child psychosocial 
functioning; H2c: lower mean levels of reported child 
mental health challenges; and H2d: higher mean levels of 
treatment adherence. Children will be the unit of analysis 
for these primary preliminary analyses.
Linear mixed models (LMMs) will be used to evaluate 
the proposed hypotheses. In addition, we will plot means by group over time to describe overall patterns of change. 
We will fit three-level LMMs including random inter -
cepts for clinic membership and random intercepts and 
slopes for subjects. Due to the modest sample size, signif -
icance testing will be de-emphasized. Similarly, although 
the modest sample size precludes formal investigation 
of moderation, we will apply the same LMM approach 
described above to compare children across study arms 
over time on the moderators listed in Table  2. These 
moderation analyses will be secondary exploratory analy -
ses. Additional exploratory analyses will study caregiv -
ers and children jointly as the unit of analysis via dyadic 
analysis methods such as actor-partner and means-and-
deviation models to quantify caregiver vs. child stigma 
effects and between- vs. within-dyad effects on mental 
health outcomes [81, 82].
Sample size and power calculation
Although the study purpose is to determine feasibility 
and acceptability, rather than conduct formal hypothesis 
tests, we conducted several power analyses using NCSS 
PASS to supply additional information. Assuming α = .05 
and power = .80, 81 participants would be retained at the 
final time point following 10% estimated attrition, and 
a clinic-based conservative unconditional ICC of 9.3% 
based on our previous Suubi study implemented among 
children orphaned by HIV/AIDS in the study region [83]. 
Therefore, our sample size of 90 dyads provides adequate 
statistical power to test our primary aim of feasibility. 
Additionally, for the target enrollment proportion of 70% 
to assess feasibility, the width to the limit of the confi -
dence interval is 27.9% (standardized distance .32). For 
continuous standard normal variables to assess accepta -
bility, the distance from the mean to the confidence limit 
is .30. These distances to confidence limits are between 
small (.20) and medium (.50) effect sizes. For preliminary 
efficacy exploratory analyses with two time points and 
paired comparisons of two out of the three groups at 81/3 
= 27 participants per group (N = 54 per comparison), 
minimum detectable standardized mean differences for 
continuous outcomes (stigma, mental health, and social 
support measures as described in Table  2) ranged from 
.79 to .97 for within-subject correlations (r) ranging from 
.20 to .80. Overall, our study is powered to detect small-
medium distances to confidence limits for descriptive 
statistics and large longitudinal analysis effects.
Qualitative data analysis
All interviews will be audio-taped, transcribed, and 
uploaded to QSR NVivo12 analytic software. Transcripts 
will be reviewed by the research team to develop a broad 
understanding of the content and identify topics of dis -
cussion and observation. Analytic induction techniques 
Page 9 of 14
 Nabunya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:95 
 
[84] will be used for coding. For initial coding, 10 tran -
scripts will be randomly selected and read multiple times 
and independently coded by the team using a priori 
(from the interview guide) or emergent themes (open 
coding) [85]. Broader themes will be broken down into 
smaller, more specific units until no further subcategory 
is necessary. Analytic memos will be written to further 
develop categories, themes, and subthemes, and to inte -
grate the ideas that emerge from the data [85, 86]. The 
codes and the inclusion/exclusion criteria for assigning 
a specific code [87] will be discussed as a team to create 
the final codebook in NVivo. Each transcript will then 
be coded independently by two team members using the 
codebook to establish inter-coder reliability. A level of 
agreement between 66 and 97% indicates good reliability 
[88]. Disagreements will be resolved through discussions 
in team meetings. The secondary analysis will compare 
themes within (including children versus caregivers) and 
across the two treatment groups to identify patterns, dif -
ferences, and relationships among findings. Facilitators’ 
data will be analyzed using the same procedures and will 
be compared and contrasted to participant data. To fur -
ther ensure rigor, member checking to explore the opin -
ions, beliefs and attitudes of participants, data audit trail, 
and analytic memos will be used [78, 89].
Data integration
Although qualitative and quantitative data analyses will 
be done separately, findings will be integrated at the 
interpretation and discussion stages. Conclusions and 
inferences will be synthesized for a more contextualized 
and thorough understanding of change mechanisms and 
the preliminary impact of each intervention arm. Spe -
cifically, qualitative and quantitative data will serve two 
purposes: (1) complementarity and (2) expansion [90, 
91]. Qualitative findings will be connected to quantitative 
findings where the former will provide explanations and 
context for findings produced by the latter. Moreover, 
qualitative findings will complement our understanding 
of attendance and participant satisfaction for each treat -
ment arm.
Data safety and monitoring
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will not be 
needed for this study because of the following: (1) Suub -
i4Stigma is a pilot intervention study with children and 
their caregivers in a single site; (2) We are using two evi -
dence-based interventions, with no known adverse effect 
on their recipients; and (3) the interventions are psycho -
social in nature and poses no more than minimal risk to 
participants. We believe that the multiple principal inves -
tigators (MPIs) (Nabunya and Ssewamala), In-country-PI 
(Mugisha), and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)—both in Uganda and at Washington University in St. Louis, will 
be sufficient to monitor the trial. The MPIs have put in 
place a detailed Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP , 
details below) to ensure data safety.
To protect the integrity of participants’ data, the fol -
lowing procedures will be followed: first, all data col -
lected from the study participants will be used only for 
the purpose of research. All data will be kept confiden -
tial. We will not share any information or answers we get 
from participants with their families, classmates, friends, 
or teachers. In the same way, we will not share any infor -
mation or answers we get from the primary caregivers 
with their children, other relatives, friends, teachers, or 
public officials. Second, all participants (adolescents and 
caregivers) in the study will be assigned a random code 
number by the in-country study coordinator under the 
guidance of the MPIs. This code number is used on all 
information collected from participants, including ques -
tionnaires. We will maintain lists of participants with 
links between identifying information and code numbers 
to facilitate participant follow-up. Only the MPIs and in-
country study coordinator will have access to these lists, 
which are kept in locked files. Other study personnel 
have access on an as needed basis to individual partici -
pants’ names and code numbers in order to adequately 
perform their duties, for example, interviewers must 
label the questionnaires with the correct code number of 
the participant whom they are interviewing.
All study personnel must complete certain levels of 
training before they are granted access to this identifying 
information. They must complete the Human Subjects 
Training. Personnel also sign confidentiality statements 
that specify that if the participants’ confidentiality is 
breached unintentionally that personnel will follow the 
procedures for reporting this breach to the MPIs. The 
confidentiality statements also state that unintentional 
or deliberate violations of participants’ confidentiality 
may result in demotion or termination depending upon 
the severity of the event. The project personnel also par -
ticipate in training with the MPIs, the in-country study 
coordinator and the in-country PI regarding data safety, 
confidentiality of participants, limits of confidentiality, 
and proper administration of the study protocol.
All hard copies of data will be stored in locked cabinets 
to which only the MPIs and the in-country study coor -
dinator will have access. After completion of an inter -
view with a study participant, data with code numbers 
is placed in a separate locked file cabinet while waiting 
for entry. Once data is entered into computer files and 
password protected, only the MPIs, the in-country study 
coordinator and data entry assistants will have access to 
these files. All requests, current and future, to use the 
data are reviewed by the MPIs. Any data files that are 
Page 10 of 14 Nabunya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:95 
provided to other individuals are stripped of identifiers 
and contain only code numbers so that data across multi -
ple assessment waves can be matched.
Within the informed consent/assent, participants are 
notified of the above procedures. Participants are also 
informed of the limits of confidentiality. Specifically, par -
ticipants are warned that Ugandan law mandates report -
ing of abuse and/or neglect of children, and that threat 
of harm to self or others requires intervention by clinical 
staff. Participants will be informed of these limits during 
the consent process and at the beginning of the interview 
process. To make sure that interviewers have accurate 
knowledge of what does and does not constitute report -
able child abuse and/or neglect, interviewers will receive 
training on the Ugandan laws regarding child abuse and/
or neglect. Interviewers who suspect child abuse and/or 
neglect will be instructed to contact the in-country study 
coordinator, the in-country PI, and/or MPIs, rather than 
contact the Ugandan local authorities themselves. Prior 
to making a decision of whether to make a report of child 
abuse and/or neglect, the case will be discussed among 
a group consisting of the interviewer, study coordinator, 
and the MPIs. It is important to note that all three MPIs 
are social workers by training and are knowledgeable 
about what types of child abuse and/or neglect rise to the 
level required for a report to be made. These procedures 
are intended to protect the safety of children, and at the 
same time reduce the risk that erroneous reports are 
made. If we determine that a report must be made, we 
will inform the caregiver of our intention to report, and 
the reasons why a report must be made, unless we think 
that doing so would pose an immediate risk to the youth. 
In case further counseling is needed, the project staff will 
make the referrals.
Monitoring and responding to adverse events
All study personnel based in Uganda will be trained in 
identifying indicators of conditions that may jeopardize 
the welfare of participants and the limits of confiden -
tiality. This training, conducted by the MPIs, includes 
reviewing possible scenarios and knowledge of key ques -
tions used to assess risk. Interview staff are trained to err 
on the side of caution and told to contact the study coor -
dinator, who will always be available, by telephone, in the 
event of the need to break confidentiality due to manda -
tory reporting or ethical concerns. Under the guidance of 
in-country PI, research staff are trained either to contact 
the police to ensure safety of participants, or if appropri -
ate, to have emergency personnel take the youth or car -
egiver to the nearest hospital.
Reporting of adverse events will occur according to a 
project protocol. For this study, safety and monitoring 
will be overseen by the in-country PI (Dr. Mugisha), and the in-country Co-I (Dr. Mwebembezi)—both of whom 
will be stationed in Uganda during the study, and the 
other two MPIs (Drs. Nabunya and Ssewamala, based in 
the USA). In the case of an adverse event, staff will inform 
the in-country PI (Dr. Mugisha) and Co-I, Dr. Mwebem -
bezi immediately and then the MPIs Drs. Nabunya and 
Ssewamala within 24 h of the presence of a possible 
unanticipated adverse event. Any presence of a possible 
unanticipated adverse event will be immediately reported 
and brought to the attention of the Washington Uni -
versity Institutional Review Board (along with the Eth -
ics Committee at Uganda Virus Research Institute, and 
Uganda National Council of Science and Technology). 
The IRBs will determine whether it is appropriate to stop 
the study protocol temporarily or will provide sugges -
tions and/or modifications to the study procedures. Pos -
sible modifications may include adding new risks to the 
consent form and re-consenting all study participants.
Preliminary outcomes data will be examined quarterly 
by the MPIs, in-country PI, and the co-investigators. If 
preliminary outcome data indicates harmful impact of 
the program to the study participants (the children and/
or their caregivers), Washington University IRB com -
mittee, as well as the Ethic Committee at Uganda Virus 
Research Institute and Uganda National Council of Sci -
ence and Technology IRB will be notified and it is pos -
sible that the study will be discontinued immediately. 
However, we do not anticipate any negative effects of
Data management and quality assurance
To collect data, Qualtrics, an electronic data capture sys -
tem will be used. All tablets/iPads containing Qualtrics 
will be password protected. However, the option of com -
pleting a paper interview will remain available in case of 
technical difficulties. The interviewer will submit the tab -
let/iPad to their supervisor who will store the tablet/iPad 
in a locked file box until return from the field. Responses 
from Qualtrics will be downloaded daily by the data man -
ager, onto a state-of-the-art secured dedicated server. 
All completed surveys will be printed out upon inter -
viewers’ return from the field. These hard copies will be 
stored as back up of the data in a double-locked environ -
ment. Trained, supervised research assistants will enter 
the data onto secure, encrypted computers. The entered 
data will then be double-checked for completeness and 
accuracy. To address concerns of breach of confidential -
ity, all study documents and data will be maintained in 
password-protected computer files. Confidentiality of 
study documents will be maintained by assigning unique 
study IDs and using these rather than participant names 
on all study related materials. Paper copies of documents 
will be maintained in locked file cabinets in respective 
countries. Participant consent forms and ID logs will be

 Nabunya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:95 
 
kept in a separate locked cabinet. Tracking information 
also will be kept on a password-protected computer. The 
master list will only be used to coordinate data collec -
tion, and all staff will be required to receive training on 
both human subjects’ protections, as well as maintaining 
the confidentiality of participants. The MPIs and the in-
country study coordinator will oversee the quality assur -
ance monitoring.
Missing data
Research assistants and study coordinator will be trained 
to check assessments for missing items before leaving 
the participant. If any missing items are identified, par -
ticipants will be asked to answer those items–unless 
they chose not to answer those particular items. The 
study coordinator will also review assessments within 5 
working days of completion. If missing items are identi -
fied in the baseline assessment (time point 1), research 
assistants will follow-up with the participants before 
the first session of the intervention. If missing items are 
identified at follow-up time points (3 and 6 months post-
intervention initiation), research assistants will follow-
up with the participants within 7 days of the original 
date of the assessment.
Plan for record keeping
The study will maintain records of adverse events, any 
referrals for counseling, as well as copies of the consent 
and assent forms. All records will be maintained in a 
locked filing cabinet at the Uganda-project office acces -
sible only by the research team. The MPIs will be respon -
sible for data security and record keeping. The data sets 
that will be used for analysis will not contain any iden -
tifying information—specifically, names and addresses of 
the participants.
Plan for disposition of identifiers at the end of the study
Identifiers for the participants will be disposed of follow -
ing local IRB guidelines. To protect the participants’ con -
fidentiality, identifiers only will be accessible by the MPIs 
and Co-Is (Uganda- and US-based) and the study coor -
dinator and will be kept separated from others with the 
participants’ responses.
Discussion
This study seeks to address the urgent need for innova -
tive, theoretically, and empirically informed interven -
tions to reduce HIV/AIDS-associated stigma and its 
negative impact on adolescent health and psychoso -
cial well-being. More specifically, the study will exam -
ine two evidence-based interventions used in mental 
health settings, schools, and communities: G-CBT 
focused on cognitive restructuring and strengthening coping skills at the individual level; and MFG interven -
tion that strengthens family relationships to address 
stigma among CLWH and their families. Existing inter -
ventions focus on reducing fear of HIV infection among 
non-infected individuals as they interact with PLWH. 
This study offers an opportunity to develop a cultur -
ally acceptable and effective family-level intervention to 
address HIV/AIDS-associated stigma and its impact on 
CLWH’s wellbeing in SSA.
This study innovates in the following ways: (1) HIV 
stigma-reduction interventions targeting CLWH in SSA 
are almost non-existent. This study will generate data 
driven knowledge to address HIV-associated stigma 
among CLWH and within their families. (2) The study 
will apply and compare two evidence-based, theoreti -
cally guided interventions, G-CBT vs MFG, to address 
HIV-associated stigma. (3) The MFG approach is cultur -
ally consistent with SSA’s collective approach of families 
raising children “together, ” which strengthens its appeal 
to communities and its likelihood of success in address -
ing both individual-and family-level stigma. (4) Delivery 
of G-CBT, which will be facilitated by trained para-coun -
selors, is an approach that has not been tested in this 
context and with this specific population. In Uganda, 
para-counselors are trained to assist with the psychologi -
cal needs of individuals, including those related to HIV/
AIDS and mental health. (5) Partnering with local institu -
tions, including health clinics and community organiza -
tions, grounds the project with a practical understanding 
of the needs of CLWH in Masaka, a region hardest hit by 
the HIV/AIDS epidermic.
Study findings will be disseminated through local, 
national, and global meetings/workshops/conferences 
and peer-reviewed publications. The research team will 
also hold meetings to share study results with commu -
nity stakeholders in the study region. This study will lay 
the foundation for a larger intervention study investigat -
ing how HIV/AIDS-associated stigma can be reduced to 
foster healthy child development, especially for CLWH 
as they transition to adolescence. The long-term goal is 
to develop culturally appropriate, feasible, acceptable, 
and effective interventions that address HIV/AIDS-asso -
ciated stigma and its impact on CLWH’s wellbeing and 
their families in SSA.
