Abstract
Background: There is little systematic operational guidance about how best to develop complex interventions to
reduce the gap between practice and evidence. This article is one in a Series of articles documenting the
development and use of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to advance the science of implementation
research.
Methods: The intervention was developed considering three main components: theory, evidence, and practical
issues. We used a four-step approach, consisting of guiding questions, to direct the choice of the most appropriate
components of an implementation intervention: Who needs to do what, differently? Using a theoretical framework,
which barriers and enablers need to be addressed? Which intervention components (behaviour change techniques
and mode(s) of delivery) could overcome the modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers? And how can
behaviour change be measured and understood?
Results: A complex implementation intervention was designed that aimed to improve acute low back pain
management in primary care. We used the TDF to identify the barriers and enablers to the uptake of evidence into
practice and to guide the choice of intervention components. These components were then combined into a
cohesive intervention. The intervention was delivered via two facilitated interactive small group workshops. We also
produced a DVD to distribute to all participants in the intervention group. We chose outcome measures in order to
assess the mediating mechanisms of behaviour change.
Conclusions: We have illustrated a four-step systematic method for developing an intervention designed to
change clinical practice based on a theoretical framework. The method of development provides a systematic
framework that could be used by others developing complex implementation interventions. While this framework
should be iteratively adjusted and refined to suit other contexts and settings, we believe that the four-step process
should be maintained as the primary framework to guide researchers through a comprehensive intervention
development process.

Background
Many resources have been directed toward improving
the quality and safety of health care, but major problemspersist [1]. Implementation interventions are interven-
tions designed to change clinical practice behaviour and
improve the uptake of evidence into practice. To date,implementation interventions have had limited and var-
ied effects [2]. This may be due, in part, to a lack of ex-
plicit rationale for the intervention choice and the use ofinappropriate methods to design the interventions [3-5].
The design of implementation interventions requires a
systematic approach with a strong rationale for designand explicit reporting of the intervention development
process [6-8]. One option is to use theory to inform the
design of implementation interventions [3,9]. The UKMedical Research Council ’s (MRC) guidance for devel-
oping complex interventions informed by theory [10-13]
is useful as a general approach to designing an imple-mentation intervention, but it does not provide detailed
guidance about how to achieve this.
Multiple theories and frameworks of individual and or-
ganisational behaviour change exist, and often these the-
ories have conceptually overlapping constructs [14-16].
Only a few of these theories have been tested in robustresearch in healthcare settings. There is currently no sys-
tematic basis for determining which among the various
theories available predicts behaviour or behaviourchange most precisely [17], or which is best suited to
underpin implementation re search [16,18]. Theories
that have been used in previous implementation re-search include PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing,
and Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and
Evaluation), diffusion of innovations, informationoverload, and social marketing [5].
This article is one in a Series of articles documenting
the development and use of the Theoretical DomainsFramework (TDF) to advance the science of implemen-
tation research. The TDF was developed using an expert
consensus process and validation to identify psycho-logical and organisational theory relevant to health prac-
titioner clinical behaviour change [19]. A set of 12
domains covering the main factors influencing practi-
tioner clinical behaviour and behaviour change were
identified: knowledge; skills; social/professional role andidentity; beliefs about capabilities; beliefs about conse-
quences; motivation and goals; memory, attention and
decision processes; environmental context andresources; social influences; emotion; behavioural regula-
tion; and nature of the behaviours. Relative to previously
accepted, often implicit, models for developing interven-tions (for example, need to raise awareness, to provide
information, to educate, need for an opinion leader or
champion), these 12 domains provide an extensiveframework that has greater coverage of potential barriersto change, and thus implies a greater range of potential
intervention components.
Although improved health care can be facilitated at
different levels of the health system, one important ap-
proach is to support individual health professionals to
modify their clinical behaviour in response to evidence-based guidance [15]. The focus on this level is because
much of health care is delivered in the context of an en-
counter between a health professional and a patient,making healthcare professional clinical behaviours an
important proximal determinant of the quality of care
that patients receive.
Development of implementation interventions can
draw on theory, evidence, and practical issues in the fol-
lowing ways. Theory can be used to understand the fac-tors that might influence the clinical behaviour change
being targeted, to underpin possible techniques that
could be used to change clinical behaviour [19], and toclarify how such techniques might work. Evidence can
inform which clinical behaviours should be changed, and
which potential behaviour change techniques and modesof delivery are likely to be effective. Practical issues then
determine which behaviour change techniques are feas-
ible with available resources, and which are likely to beacceptable in the relevant setting and to the targeted
health professional group.
This paper outlines a method for developing an imple-
mentation intervention, drawing on the guidance from
the UK MRC framework [10-12], and building on previ-
ously published methods for theory-informed interven-tion development [20,21]. We discuss how we used this
method for developing an implementation intervention
using the example of a recently developed interventionthat we tested in the IMPLEMENT cluster randomised
trial [22].
Methods
A method for developing implementation interventions
to change clinical behaviour
We used a four-step approach, consisting of guiding
questions to direct the choice of the most appropriate
components of an implementation intervention (Table 1).The four steps represent: identifying the problem (who
needs to do what, differently?); assessing the problem
(using a theoretical framework, which barriers andenablers need to be addressed?); forming possible solu-
tions (which intervention components could overcome
the modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers?); andevaluating the selected intervention (how can behaviour
change be measured and understood?).
Step 1. Who needs to do what, differently?
We selected the target clinical behaviours to be addressed,
based on documented evidence-practice gaps. We specifiedFrench et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:38 Page 2 of 8
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/38
the target behaviours in detai l by asking the following ques-
tions: What is the clinical be haviour (or series of linked
behaviours) that you will try to change? Who performs thebehaviour(s)? And when and where do they perform the
behaviour(s)?
Step 2. Using a theoretical framework, which barriers
and enablers need to be addressed?
We chose a theoretical framework that we considered
was most likely to inform the pathways of behaviourchange. We used qualitative methods, underpinned by
this theoretical framework, to identify the barriers and
enablers to the pathways of change that were likely toinfluence the target clinical behaviours.
Step 3. Which intervention components (behaviour
change techniques and mode(s) of delivery) could over-come the modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers?
Informed by our chosen theoretical framework, and em-
pirical evidence about effectiveness of behaviour changetechniques, we identified techniques to overcome the
barriers and enhance the enablers. We first established
the content of the intervention (what will actually bedelivered), then we identified possible modes of delivery
(how each chosen technique would be delivered) [23].
We based the final selection of behaviour change techni-ques and mode of delivery on what we considered was
locally relevant, likely to be feasible, and could be imple-
mented as a cohesive intervention.
Step 4. How can behaviour change be measured and
understood?
We determined in advance the outcome measures forbehaviour change and which mediators of change could
be measured to evaluate the proposed pathways of
change [24]. We based the selection of outcomemeasures on the availability of reliable and valid mea-
sures that were feasible to use.
Results
The resultant IMPLEMENT intervention was delivered via
two facilitated interactive small group workshops that werea combination of didactic lectures and small group discus-
sions and activities. We also produced a DVD to distribute
to all general practitioners (GPs) in the intervention groupwith the primary purpose of providing the material to
those who could not attend the workshops. This alternative
mode of delivering the same intervention content includedfilm footage from the workshops and electronic resources
related to acute low back pain management.
Step 1. Who needs to do what, differently?
The target behaviours for the IMPLEMENT intervention
arose from two recommendations from the Australianevidence-based clinical practice guideline for acute low
back pain [25]. The first target behaviour was to restrict
the ordering of plain film x-rays to situations in whichfracture is suspected because plain film x-rays are rarely
helpful in the management of acute low back pain and
are potentially harmful. The second target behaviourwas to advise patients with acute non-specific low back
pain to remain active because this reduces pain and
disability.
We chose these target behaviours because they had
strong supporting evidence, were potentially modifi-
able at a practitioner level, and were clinical beha-viours to be performed by the GP during a clinical
interaction early in the course of management of
acute low back pain.Table 1 Steps for developing a theory-informed implementation intervention

Step 2. Using a theoretical framework, which barriers
and enablers need to be addressed?
To develop the IMPLEMENT intervention, we used theTDF [19] to identify the barriers and enablers to the tar-
get behaviours and to guide the choice of intervention
components. Barriers to, and enablers of, the two targetbehaviours were identified in a qualitative study consist-
ing of focus group interviews with 42 GPs in Victoria,
Australia [26]. Each focus group was led by a trained fa-cilitator who investigated the reasons GPs gave for prac-
tising, or not, in a manner consistent with the guideline
recommendations. Questions were designed to explorethe domains from the TDF for each of the two beha-
viours. Key domains were identified that described the
specific barriers and enablers at a theoretical level, whichthen allowed us to access relevant evidence of likely ef-
fective behaviour change techniques.
Step 3. Which intervention components (behaviour
change techniques and mode(s) of delivery) could over-
come the modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers?
For the IMPLEMENT trial, our selection of behaviourchange techniques was informed by a matrix that
mapped behaviour change techniques to the theoretical
domains, based on expert consensus about effectivenessfor behaviour change [27]. We used the experience of
the research team including clinicians and clinician edu-
cators, together with feedback from clinical colleagueson potential intervention approaches, to determine
which behaviour change techniques and modes of deliv-
ery to select.
We chose the delivery mode of facilitated workshops
because interactive education is familiar, acceptable, and
feasible for GPs, and there is evidence that interventionsdelivered using this mode of delivery may change profes-
sional practice [28]. Also, this delivery mode could be
linked to the requirements for Continuing ProfessionalDevelopment points for GPs in Australia. Finally, the
intervention was assessed by the clinical members of the
research team who checked that the proposed contentwas likely to be regarded by participants as relevant and
helpful to their practice.
Table 2 provides details of the intervention develop-
ment process of the IMPLEMENT intervention. The
columns indicate how we linked specified barriers andenablers to theoretical domains and then identified be-
haviour change techniques and modes of delivery. For
example, one identified barrier was lack of skill: someGPs reported that they lacked the communication skills
to reassure patients that a plain film x-ray is unneces-
sary. We mapped this barrier to the domains ‘skills ’and
‘beliefs about capabilities ’. It was considered that these
domains were best addressed by using the behaviour
change technique ‘rehearsal ’[27]. We delivered this in
the facilitated workshop in a small group activity,where the GP took a clinical history with a trained
simulated patient who repeatedly requested an x-ray,
and the GP was asked to explain to the patient thata plain film x-ray was unnecessary, followed by a
group discussion of the issues the GPs faced during the
activity.
Detailed documentation of the full content of the IM-
PLEMENT facilitated workshops is available in the Add-
itional file 1.
Step 4. How can behaviour change be measured and
understood?
Table 3 outlines the constructs we planned to measurein the IMPLEMENT trial, describing outcomes mea-
sured to assess the causal pathway (mediating mechan-
isms of behaviour change), the practitioner outcomesand the patient outcomes.
Discussion
We have illustrated a four-step method for developing
an intervention designed to change clinical behaviour
based on a theoretical framework. We have demon-strated the use of this method in a case study of design-
ing the IMPLEMENT intervention, an intervention
designed to improve the management of low back painin general practice [22].
Many researchers who assess barriers and enablers for
implementation problem assessment do not do thiswithin a theoretical framework and are therefore limited
to pragmatic, rather than theoretically informed, solu-
tions [37]. The use of our method when designing im-plementation interventions allows the use of theory and
empirical research, along with the results of mixed
methods research, to decide upon intervention compo-nents and to build a complex intervention. This will
allow for further exploration of the associations between
intervention components and intervention effects [38].We also encourage researchers involved in developing
implementation interventions to better document and
report their own development process thus generating abody of knowledge about explicit methods for developing
these interventions.
Strengths of this method
The main strength of this four-step method is that it can
be used as a guide for implementation intervention
developers through a systematic method of moving from
target behaviours, to theoretical domains, to behaviourchanges techniques, and finally a full implementation
intervention. By basing implementation interventions on
a theoretical approach to behaviour change and linkingthis to relevant and effective behaviour change techni-
ques, researchers can make explicit, and thus investigate,
the hypothesised mechanisms of change. We propose astreamlined approach moving directly from identifiedFrench et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:38 Page 4 of 8

theoretical domains relevant to the implementation
problem to behaviour change techniques.
Multiple theories and frameworks of individual and or-
ganisational behaviour change exist [14-16], and choosingan appropriate theory for desi gning implementation inter-
ventions is challenging [16-18]. Setting predetermined cri-
teria for selection of theories may assist, for example,including consideration of the evidence base for the theory,
the relevance to the setting, and perceived usefulness of
the theory. Also, using a broadly based theoretical frame-work for behaviour change, rather than a single theory,
may allow a more comprehensive examination of potential
barriers and enablers, and possible mechanisms linkingthem to the target clinical behaviour. The TDF is arguably
the most comprehensive framework for designing imple-
mentation interventions as it offers broad coverage of po-tential change pathways; however other theoretical
frameworks, or specific theories, could be used.
There are many potential delivery modes in the clinical
setting for most behaviour change techniques [27], includ-
ing educational meetings, educational detailing, reminder
systems, and audit and feedback [39]. We suggest thechoice of the delivery mode is guided by local context and
what is acceptable and feasible in the target group.Potential limitations of this method
There is subjectivity in this proposed process of designingimplementation interventions of combining research evi-
dence, matrix mapping, and feasibility information. Fur-ther empirical work is required to test the method in
different contexts and examine the links between theoret-
ical assessment and behaviour change techniques. Thereare alternative ways of operatio nalising this method. For ex-
ample, in other studies the TDF has been used to identify
key domains followed by predictive theory-based surveys tocheck whether the domains regarded as ‘key ’actually do
predict clinical practice [40]. Another approach has been to
u s et h eT D Ft oi d e n t i f ys p e c i f i ct h e o r i e so fb e h a v i o u rchange to inform the intervent ion [40-42]. Documentation
and careful reporting of the development process of imple-
mentation interventions will further this field.
In IMPLEMENT, barriers and enablers were assessed by
conducting focus groups with GPs. Hence, the interven-
tion developed was directed at the individual clinician.However, in broader application of the TDF, although data
may be gathered at an individual level, theory is not
restricted to the individual level and may address organ-isational determinants of behaviour change, such as the
included domains Environmental context and resources,

Professional role and identity, and Social influences which
address issues beyond the individual clinician.
This method of intervention development requires
considerable time and resources. Developing the IMPLE-
MENT intervention involved time of a PhD student
(SDF), his supervisors (SEG and RB), and input from therest of the research team via teleconferences and email
correspondence over 12 months. During this time we
were also developing the method itself, adding to thetime needed. Full detail of the resources required to de-
velop the IMPLEMENT intervention will be reported in
a separate economic evaluation publication.
The resources required could be seen as a necessary
component of the development of complex behaviour
change implementation interventions [12]. Resources toenable this will depend on funding models allocating
sufficient funds for the intervention development com-
ponent of research studies and to require this as a com-ponent of guideline development and implementation
initiatives. Currently, many funding bodies expect that,
at the time at which funding applications are submitted,the intervention protocol for complex interventions is
already well formulated [43]. This contrasts with, for
example, pharmacologic interventions, for which it isaccepted that a decade or two of basic research is
required before an intervention is ready for trialling. The
publication of the new guidance for the MRC framework[12], along with applications of the framework which
demonstrate the resource intensive nature of this work,
will hopefully facilitate increased funding for this im-portant activity, increasing the likelihood that interven-
tions will be fit for evaluation in trials, and will therefore
better utilise research investments.
Conclusions
We have illustrated a four-step systematic method fordeveloping an intervention designed to change clinician
behaviour based on a theoretical framework. We propose
a streamlined approach moving directly from identifiedtheoretical domains relevant to the implementation prob-
lem to behaviour change techniques. This method is a
conceptual aid, rather than a rigid prescription; it may beiteratively adjusted and refined to suit other contexts
and settings. The process outlined here can be used by
researchers and quality improvement practitioners toguide a comprehensive intervention development process.
By basing implementation interventions on a theoretical
approach to behaviour change and linking this to relevantand effective behaviour change techniques, researchers
can make explicit, and thus investigate, the hypothesised
mechanisms of change. We have argued that using such amethod can facilitate the development of theory-informed
implementation interventions. Finally, appropriatereporting of the processes used to develop the interven-
tions, and of the components of the intervention, is
necessary.
