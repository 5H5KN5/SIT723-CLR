ABSTRACT
Background: Psychological interventions have mixed e ﬀects on
improving employee outcomes, partly due to signi ﬁcant variability
across studies and a lack of focus on mechanisms of action. This
scoping review reports on the parameters of these interventions
and examines intervention content to bring clarity to this
heterogeneous topic area and direct future systematic review work.
Method: Six databases were searched (Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase,
Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Science) from April 2010 to August
2020, and a grey literature search was undertaken. Screening was
undertaken independently by two authors. The results summarised
country, participant and employment characteristics, psychological
interventions and work, health and wellbeing outcomes. 10% of
the papers were analysed to determine the feasibility of coding
intervention descriptions for theory and behaviour change
technique (BCT) components.
Results: Database searches yielded 9341 titles, of which 91 studies
were included. Most studies were conducted in Europe (78%) and
included males and females (95%) ranging in age from 31-56.6
years although other demographic, and employment information
was lacking. Musculoskeletal pain was common (87%).
Psychological interventions commonly included cognitive
behavioural therapy (30%) and education (28%). Most studies
employed a randomised control trial design (64%). Over half
contained a control group (54%). Interventions were delivered in
mostly healthcare settings (72%) by health professionals. Multiple
outcomes were often reported, many of which involved measuring
sickness absence and return-to-work (62%) and pain and general
health (53%). Within the feasibility analysis, most papers met theARTICLE HISTORY

Conclusion: Psychological interventions for employees with
chronic pain vary in their nature and implementation. We haveshown scoping reviews can be used to assess the feasibility of
applying tools from health psychology to identify the content of
these interventions in future systematic review work to improve
intervention development.
Introduction
Pain is a major public health issue that is a burden on health and social care systems across the
world. Chronic primary pain, de ﬁned as pain in one or more anatomical regions that persists
or recurs for longer than three months (Nicholas et al., 2019)aﬀects up to half of the UK popu-
lation at any one time (Fayaz et al., 2016). Evidence suggests that moderate or severe chronic
pain can have a signi ﬁcant adverse impact on an individual ’s daily activities, including their
working lives (Breivik, Eisenberg, & O ’Brien, 2013). Musculoskeletal pain, a common type
of chronic pain, is among the leading causes of sickness absence in the UK and Europeand, along with presenteeism and changes in employment status bears a high economic
cost associated with reduced productivity in the workplace (Patel et al., 2012;P h i l i p s ,
2009). This burden is only set to increase with the ageing population and the removal of
the retirement age in established economies (Holland & Clayton, 2019). From the employee
perspective, not working is problematic because evidence suggests that healthy and safe work
confers bene ﬁts for physical and mental health, and these bene ﬁts outweigh the risks associ-
ated with long-term worklessness or prolonged sickness absence (Black, 2008).
To address the burden of chronic pain among employees, there is a clear need for
eﬀective interventions to be developed, implemented and scaled-up. Systematic reviews
have reported on interventions involving workplace accommodations, service coordi-nation and health service provision including psychological support to reduce sickness
absence and increase return-to-work among employees with pain and musculoskeletal
disorders, but there is mixed evidence on the e ﬀectiveness of these interventions
(Finnes et al., 2019; Pike, Hearns, & Williams, 2016; Wainwright, Wainwright, Coghill,
Walsh, & Perry, 2019). Some evidence suggests that psychological interventions work
best as part of multimodal interventions including e.g. workplace accommodations, and
broader psychosocial factors (Cullen et al., 2018; Kamper et al., 2015), however there is
little sense of how psychological interventions work or which particular intervention com-
ponents are associated with e ﬀectiveness. One of the key problems with getting useful
information out of the published literature is the signi ﬁcant heterogeneity in populations,
occupation, content, delivery and setting of interventions (Main & Shaw, 2016).
In the present study, we conducted a scoping review, the ﬁrst of its kind, to bring
clarity to this ﬁeld through reporting on various parameters within the published litera-
ture regarding psychological interventions among employees with chronic pain. The
purpose of our scoping review was to shape the direction of future research in the
ﬁeld through identifying gaps in knowledge and de ﬁning the parameters for future sys-
tematic review work seeking to improve intervention design. The following questionsdirected the review: (1) What is the volume, geographical scope, population and26 J. L. MCPARLAND ET AL.
employment characteristics of psychological interventions for employees with chronic
pain?, (2) What are the characteristics of psychological interventions for employees
with chronic pain?, (3) What are the primary and secondary outcomes of psychologicalinterventions for employees with chronic pain?
The second aim of our research was to determine the viability of analysing the content
of intervention descriptions in this body of literature for theory and behaviour change
techniques. We do this by assessing the viability of using tools from health psychologyto help resolve problems of heterogeneous intervention descriptions. Within health psy-
chology and behavioural science, a series of tools have recently been developed that
provide a common language of intervention components. These are invaluable for resol-ving problems of varied and inconsistent descriptions of intervention content. From the
behaviour change wheel approach (Michie, Strelan, & West, 2011) the common language
of intervention content can be thought of on several related levels, including (i) ‘interven-
tion functions ’that consider the type of intervention, (ii) the ‘theoretical domains ’, or the
causal mechanisms that key intervention components moderate and (iii) the ‘behaviour
change techniques ’(BCTs) that are often central to intervention content. Previous work
by Palmer et al. ( 2012) examined BCTs present in interventions for employees with mus-
culoskeletal disorders using an early behaviour change taxonomy but did not examine
underlying causal mechanisms and their theoretical relevance. Critically, to be able to
use these tools e ﬀectively, it must ﬁrst be established that there are adequate intervention
descriptions or manuals available within the published literature. We examined the
quality of intervention descriptions within a random sample of papers from the
scoping review to determine whether they could usefully be subjected to this type ofanalysis, allowing us to de-risk this type of analysis in future systematic review work
where the analysis of all intervention descriptions would be required.
Materials and methods
Approach to the scoping review
Aﬁve-stage methodology for scoping reviews was adopted (Arksey & O ’Malley, 2005).
This involved specifying the research question for the review (stage 1), developing the
search strategy for study identi ﬁcation (stage 2), screening and selecting relevant
studies (stage 3), developing a data extraction form (stage 4) and collating and summar-
ising the review ﬁndings (Stage 5). Details of the stages are provided below. An a priori
study protocol guided the conduct of the review. The protocol is unpublished but is avail-able from the ﬁrst author on request.
Identi ﬁcation of relevant studies
A comprehensive search strategy was developed in consultation with a specialist subject
librarian and experts in the ﬁeld, including an employer and an employee with pain. Six
databases were searched (Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, PsychINFO and Web of
Science) from 1st April 2010 until 1st April 2019, following the conduct of the last sig-niﬁcant review related to this work (Palmer et al., 2012). An updated search was con-
ducted in August 2020. Search terms were searched as keywords and MeSH terms andHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 27
combined as appropriate. The search strategy was developed and piloted in one database
(PsychINFO) before being applied to the remaining databases. The PsychINFO search
strategy can be found in supplementary ﬁle 1.
Peer-reviewed studies published in English that included adults (>16) with any type of
chronic pain, de ﬁned as pain for at least three months duration, in paid full or part-time
employment, who were either at work or on sick leave were included. Studies examining
acute or subacute pain; interventions for employers alone or for those who were unem-ployed or in voluntary occupations were excluded. Studies involving psychological
(including cognitive, behavioural, psychosocial) interventions seeking to improve work
and health and wellbeing outcomes among employees with chronic pain were included,while interventions that did not include at least one psychological intervention com-
ponent and at least one work outcome, or involved the prevention of pain were excluded.
Studies could include any design with an intervention component, although editorials,commentaries and case studies were excluded. Any type of control condition could be
included and could contain a psychological component if not included in the main inter-
vention. The reference sections of included papers were searched for additional papers, aswere the reference sections of relevant book chapters and systematic reviews that wereexcluded from the scoping review. A limited grey literature search of pain-related and
clinical websites and conference abstracts was also undertaken.
Study selection
Search results were exported into Zotero version 5.0.67.3, where duplicates were
removed. Titles and abstracts were initially screened by one author (PA) and following
this initial screening process the remaining titles were exported into Covidence. The
study inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the titles and abstracts whichwere independently screened by two authors (PA and JM). Independent full-text screen-
ing was also undertaken by these authors. Any disagreements between authors were dis-
cussed and where consensus could not be reached a third author (LK) was consulted. Theupdate to the review was undertaken by JM and LK. Additionally, screening of reference
lists of identi ﬁed book chapters, included studies and systematic reviews was conducted
to identify any potential titles. Finally, conference abstracts and protocols were screenedfor publication status and possible inclusion.
Charting, summarising and reporting data
A data extraction tool was developed by the review team and piloted by two authors (PA
and LK). One author (PA) independently extracted data from all studies. A second author(JM) independently extracted data from 10% of the studies and checked the extraction
undertaken from a further 10% of the studies. Inconsistencies in extraction were resolved
through discussion. Information was extracted on the year of study, country of study,number of participants and participate age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status
and pain condition; employment status, occupation and type of organisation (review ques-
tion 1 (RQ 1)); type of intervention, study design, control condition, participant recruit-ment, intervention setting and who delivered the intervention (review question 2 (RQ2)), and primary and secondary outcomes (review question 3 (RQ 3)).28 J. L. MCPARLAND ET AL.
The studies were grouped and categorised by country of origin (Word Health Organ-
isation regions); participant and employment characteristics (age, sex, marital status,
pain condition, ethnicity, education, pain condition, employment status, type of occu-pation and employer); characteristics of the psychological interventions (type of inter-vention, control condition, study design, recruitment, intervention setting and
delivery), and work and health and wellbeing outcomes. The results are presented in
the form of a numerical summary of frequencies within the data with an accompanyingnarrative descriptive summary of the results. We also reported gaps in knowledge that
emerged from the narrative synthesis. Data categorisation was undertaken by two
authors (PA and PF) and checked by a further two authors (JM and LK).
Viability of intervention coding
A random sample of n = 9 (10%) of the papers identi ﬁed within the scoping review were
subjected to an analysis of the feasibility of coding intervention descriptions for detailed
theoretical content and intervention components to de-risk future work. Two team
members (LW and PF) independently examined the presence, length and quality of inter-vention descriptions, including the presence of explicitly mentioned BCTs using the
Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) (Michie et al., 2013), theory of
change, and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) domains (Cane, O ’Connor, &
Michie, 2012). We selected these criteria as they provide us with a basis for determining
the viability of coding theoretical content and intervention components. We chose to
focus on explicitly mentioned BCTs as opposed to those that we could infer to determine
the viability of coding these intervention descriptions. If the intervention descriptorsrequire inferred coding this has implications for the time that would be required to under-
take this type of analysis in a future systematic review. Studies were examined on whether
they (i) provided no intervention description; (ii) provided only a couple of sentences ofintervention description; (iii) provided an intervention description that was at least a para-
graph (iv) provided an intervention description that was at least and paragraph and con-
tained links to an intervention manual and further resources; (v) provided an interventiondescription that was at least a paragraph and contained a logic model or theory of change;
(vi) provided a description of at least a paragraph and included a logic model, theory of
change and made explicit mention of theory/TDF and BCTT plus links to manual/resources. The decision to choose this level of intervention description as a criterion wasbased on our previous work in this area and re ﬂects that intervention descriptions are typi-
cally brief and comprise little detail (De Barra et al., 2018;H oﬀman et al., 2014). Accord-
ingly, we determined that having the criterion of a paragraph of intervention descriptionwould enable us to determine if there was su ﬃcient information available for theory and
BCT coding. We agreed prior to this analysis that at least 50% of the intervention descrip-
tions sampled needed to contain at least one paragraph of intervention description todemonstrate the viability of conducting behavioural analyses in a future systematic review.
Results
The search of six databases yielded 9341 titles. Following the removal of 3274 duplicatesand 2524 papers that failed to meet the a priori inclusion criteria at initial screening, 3543HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 29
papers underwent title/abstract screening, with 341 papers undergoing full-text screen-
ing. Following this process, 91 papers were included in the ﬁnal review. A summary of
the key features of the included papers is in supplementary ﬁle 2. Figure 1 summarises
the selection process for the scoping review.
Country, participant and employment characteristics (RQ 1)
There were 36,108 participants across studies, with sample sizes ranging from 10 to
6709 (mean = 397). With one exception, all studies reported the age characteristics
of their sample, with age ranges from 31-56.6 years reported for the whole sample,
with the majority of studies reporting a mean age below 50 years (not tabulated). Asindicated in Table 1 , most studies were conducted in European Countries (78% of
studies), particularly Nordic countries. Few studies were conducted in the UK. Most
studies included both males and females within the intervention and/or control

groups. Over half reported education level, ﬁnding participants largely received com-
pulsory education (up to 12 years in primary and secondary education). Fewer
studies provided information on marital status or ethnicity. Those that did reportedparticipants to be mostly married and Caucasian. Musculoskeletal pain was reportedin most studies, most commonly back/spinal pain and general chronic pain/musculos-
keletal pain ( Table 1 ).
Few studies provided information on type of employer or employment characteristics.
Just over a quarter of studies reported the type of job occupied by employees. Among
these studies were self-reported ‘blue collar ’occupations (manual labour, cleaning, low
skilled) healthcare professions (e.g. nurses, eldercare workers) and ‘white collar ’

workers (e.g. management, ﬁnance) ( Table 1 ). These ﬁndings suggest there are clear gaps
in relation to the relatively limited geographical location of the research and in the under-
reporting of demographic and employment characteristics.
Characteristics of the interventions (RQ 2)
The interventions tended to be complex, in cluding multimodal elements for example
physiological rehabilitation, exercise or medication management, in addition to
psychological components. The psychological components of interventions often con-tained multiple components that drew explicitly upon approaches such as cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) (30% of studies) (Angst et al., 2014 ; Asih, Neblett,

e.g. psychoeducation. Other interventions more generally reported the use of psycho-
logical and/or behavioural principles (27. 5% of studies) (Becker, Angerer, Weber, &

2017b ; Werner et al., 2016; Westman et al., 2010) overtly reported ‘no intervention ’or
‘usual’or‘standard ’care, although frequently little detail was provided on what ‘usual
care’consisted of. The remaining studies (39%) reported a speci ﬁc control
condition (Andersen et al., 2015,2016; Becker et al., 2020; Bethge et al., 2011; Bramberg
et al., 2017; Brendbekken et al., 2017; Brendbekken et al., 2018; Brox et al., 2010; Coole
et al., 2013; Gross et al., 2017; Hammond et al., 2017; Hampel et al., 2019; Hampel &

al.,2014; Park et al., 2018; Schlicker et al., 2020), for example, education or counselling
(Table 2 ).
Among the studies reporting the method of participant recruitment (88% of studies),
the most frequent recruitment method was through a rehabilitation or rheumatology
clinic, followed by an individual ’s health insurance provider. Interventions were deliv-
ered in multiple settings, mostly healthcare settings including inpatient and outpatientclinics and clinical contexts or health centres ( Table 2 ). Interventions were frequently
delivered by more than one professional, most frequently physiotherapists, medics,
including General Practitioners, psychologists, psychiatrists or counsellors and occu-pational therapists. Given the complexity of the interventions, it was not possible to
determine who delivered the psychological interventions alone, or the setting for the
delivery of these interventions. As indicated in Table 2 , there was a lack of workplace
involvement in the recruitment, setting and delivery of the interventions.
Outcomes (RQ 3)
It is di ﬃcult to de ﬁnitively report the number of employees were at work or on sick leave
at the time of the intervention due to insu ﬃcient information or ambiguity around work
status reported in some papers. The general pattern indicates that many more employees
were on sick leave rather than at work. Over half of the studies (n=53, 58% of studies) didnot report secondary outcomes. Forty studies (44 %) reported multiple work-related out-comes (not tabulated).34 J. L. MCPARLAND ET AL.
Table 3 shows the work outcomes measured across studies. More frequently, out-
comes addressed sickness absence and return-to-work. Examples of measures of sickness
absence and return-to-work include self-reported number of workdays lost due toabsence (Andersen et al., 2016; Beemster et al., 2020; Hampel & Tlach, 2015; Law et
al.,2016; Poulain et al., 2010; Rasmussen et al., 2016; Jensen et al., 2012a ; Gismervik et
al.,2020; Knapp et al., 2015; Soler-Font et al., 2019), patient registered data (Bergstrom
et al., 2010; Bergström et al., 2012; Brendbekken et al., 2018; Busch et al., 2018; Jensen et
al.,2012b ; Jorgensen et al., 2011; Odeen et al., 2013; Ree et al., 2016; Reme et al., 2016;
Stein & Miclescu, 2013) or disability payments made (Bergstrom et al., 2010; Busch et
al.,2011; Gross et al., 2017; Hara, Bjørngaard, Brage et al., 2018; Ibrahim et al., 2019;
Jensen et al., 2011; Marchand et al., 2015; Myhre et al., 2014). Other outcomes, some
of which were also indicators of return-to-work status, broadly measured the ability to
participate in and be productive in work, including self-reported work ability ( Table
3). This was measured, for example, using a measure of the Work Ability Index
(Becker et al., 2020; Calner et al., 2017; Coole et al., 2013; Frederiksen et al., 2017; Johan-
sen et al., 2019; Jorgensen et al., 2011; Hampel et al., 2019; Knapp et al., 2015; Rasmussen
et al., 2016; Saltychev et al., 2014; Sandsjo et al., 2010; Sorensen et al., 2010). A change to
employment status and presenteeism were less frequently measured ( Table 3
).
Health and wellbeing outcomes were measured in most studies (n=81, 89% of
studies), with many studies measuring multiple outcomes (n = 75, 82% of studies)(not tabulated). As indicated in Table 3 , pain intensity was the most common
outcome. This was frequently measured, for example, using the Visual Analogue
Scale (Andersen et al., 2015,2016; Asih et al., 2018; Caby et al., 2016; Chaléat-
Valayer et al., 2016; Calner et al., 2017; Coole et al., 2013; Ernsten & Lillefjell, 2014;
Gross et al., 2017; Hammond et al., 2017; Hartzell et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2011;
Hutting et al., 2015; Lambeek et al., 2010; Lebon et al., 2017; Luk et al., 2010; Mayer

et al., 2013; Tavares Figueiredo et al., 2016; van Vilsteren et al., 2017a ). General
health outcomes were also common ( Table 3 ). These were measured, for example,
using health-related quality of life measures, such as the SF-36 (Angst et al., 2014;
Bethge et al., 2011; Calner et al., 2017; Gross et al., 2017; Howard et al., 2012; Jensen

also indicates that some outcomes were less commonly measured. These outcomesincluded mood, which was examined using, for example, the Hospital Anxiety andDepression scale (Angst et al., 2014; Berglund et al., 2018; Bethge et al., 2011;
Chaléat-Valayer et al., 2016; Coole et al., 2013; Ernsten & Lillefjell., 2014; Hampel &

and kinesiophobia which were frequently measured using the Fear Avoidance andBelief Questionnaire (Campello et al., 2012; Chaléat-Valayer et al., 2016; Coole et al.,

2015; Luthi et al., 2018; Sullivan et al., 2012; Sullivan & Adams, 2012; Sullivan &
Simon, 2012
; Westman et al., 2010), and physical function that often involved measur-
ing disability using the Oswestry Disability Index (Brox et al., 2010; Campello et al.,
2012; Harris et al., 2017; Hartzell et al., 2014; Luk et al., 2010; Marchand et al., 2015;

Sander et al., 2020; Schlicker et al., 2020) or the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire
(Coole et al., 2013; Hart ﬁel et al., 2017; Lambeek et al., 2010; Jensen et al., 2011; Ran-
tonen et al., 2012; Rantonen et al., 2014; Rantonen et al., 2018; Sorensen et al., 2010;

Intervention coding
Table 4 shows that of the 10% sample of papers coded (Bramberg et al., 2017; Gross et al.,
2017; Hara, Bjørngaard, Jacobsen et al., 2018; Jensen et al. 2012a ; Linton et al., 2016;
Sjöström et al., 2013; Sorensen et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2016; van Vilsteren et al., 2017b )
the majority met the minimum criteria of containing at least one paragraph of interven-tion description, with an additional paper also providing a link to further resources.
Therefore, as 89% of the sample met the pre-established criteria (50% at Level 2 or
better) it can be concluded that it is possible to conduct a meaningful behavioural analy-sis of the intervention descriptions. In the sample of papers examined we found none that
contained a theory of change, logic model, or explicitly mentioned BCTs.

Discussion
This scoping review, the ﬁrst of its kind, provides a picture of the heterogeneity within
the published literature on psychological interventions for employees with chronic
pain. We conducted our review to shape the direction of future research in the ﬁeld
through identifying gaps in knowledge and de ﬁning the parameters for future systematic
review work. We were also particularly interested in establishing the viability of using
tools from health psychology within subsequent systematic reviews to disentangle
diverse and inconsistently described interventions.
We found 91 papers reporting interventions that sought to improve work, health and
wellbeing outcomes, published between 2010 and 2020. The studies were mostly con-
ducted in European countries, particularly Scandinavian countries. Recipients of theinterventions tended to be young to middle-aged employees with a musculoskeletal con-dition, most commonly back or spinal pain who were recruited through health insurance
databases or healthcare settings. There was a high level of complexity within the interven-
tions. Many psychological interventions contained at least some components of CBT andwere often delivered as part of multimodal interventions containing complementary
non-psychological elements in a RCT. Most of the interventions were delivered by
non-psychologists such as physicians and allied health professionals in predominantlyhealthcare settings. Given the complexity of the interventions, it was not possible to
determine who delivered the psychological interventions. Post-intervention outcomes
tended to be multi-domain in nature, incorporating various measures concerned withreturn-to-work and sickness absence, in addition to physical and psychological function-
ing. The ﬁndings of the scoping review are broadly consistent with the pattern of ﬁndings
reported in recent systematic reviews on interventions for employees with pain and mus-culoskeletal disorders (Cullen et al., 2018; Finnes et al., 2019; Palmer et al., 2012; Pike et
al.,2016; Wainwright et al., 2019). We have contributed to the ﬁeld through using our
broad search strategy to provide detailed clarity on the current state of science in this het-
erogeneous topic area in a way that is not captured by systematic reviews that often applyspeciﬁc parameters involving e.g. speci ﬁc types of psychological interventions or samples,
such as those returning to work, to searches. Using our search strategy we were, for
example, able to report on a vast array of psychological interventions delivered toemployees at work as well as on sick leave at the time of receiving an intervention,
although insu ﬃcient reporting within papers largely made it di ﬃcult to distinguish
between both groups.
The scoping review synthesis has identi ﬁed gaps in knowledge to be addressed in
future work. Firstly, more UK-based research is needed as the ﬁndings were dominated
by research in Scandinavian countries where di ﬀerent welfare systems and employment
policies make it di ﬃcult to generalise the ﬁndings to the UK context that has higher sick-
ness absence rates Holland & Clayton, 2019; Holland & Clayton, 2011). Secondly, given
the ageing workforce (Bevan, 2016), psychological interventions for employees over the
age of 50 are needed as there was a notable absence of this research within the review.Thirdly, more research is needed to include employers within interventions as evidence
suggests that healthcare settings, where most interventions were based, may be insu ﬃ-
cient alone for pain management as there is a tendency to focus on clinical outcomesrather than work outcomes (Staal et al., 2013). Fourthly, there was an under-reportingHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 37
of employment and demographic characteristics across the studies that should be
addressed in future research because the decision to return to work is a ﬀected not
only by medical factors, but also by other, personal factors (Burdo ﬀ,2013; Wilkie &
Pransky, 2012). The scoping review ﬁndings also lay the foundation for future systematic
review work. The review has identi ﬁed numerous RCTs of psychological interventions
that address work, health and wellbeing outcomes among employees with musculoske-
letal disorders (Andersen et al., 2015; Andersen et al., 2016; Becker et al., 2020; Berglund
et al., 2018; Bergström et al., 2012; Bethge et al., 2011; Busch et al., 2011; Bramberg et al.,
2017; Brendbekken et al., 2017; Brendbekken et al., 2018; Brox et al., 2010; Calner et al.,
2017; Campello et al. ( 2012); Chaléat-Valayer et al., 2016; Coole et al. ( 2013); Hart ﬁel et
al. (2017); Frederiksen et al., 2017; Gismervik et al., 2020; Gross et al., 2017; Hammond et
al.,2017; Hampel et al., 2019; Hara, Bjørngaard, Brage et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2017;
Hutting et al., 2015; Irvine et al., 2015; Jensen et al., 2011; Jensen et al., 2012a ,2012b ; Jor-
gensen et al., 2011; Knapp et al., 2015; Lambeek et al., 2010; Lindholdt et al., 2017; Linton
et al., 2016; Marchand et al., 2015; Mhyre et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2017; Odeen et al.,
2013; Park et al., 2018; Pato et al., 2010; Pereira et al., 2019; Rasmussen et al., 2016; Ran-
tonen et al., 2012; Rantonen et al., 2014; Rantonen et al., 2018; Ree et al., 2016; Reme et
al.,2016; Sander et al., 2020; Sandsjo et al., 2010; Schlicker et al., 2020; Soler-Font et al.,
2019; Sorensen et al., 2010; Stapelfeldt et al., 2011; Streibelt & Bethge, 2014; Tan et al.,
2016; van Vilsteren et al., 2017a ; van Vilsteren et al.. 2017b ; Werner et al., 2016;
Westman et al., 2010). We have identi ﬁed a high level of complexity within these inter-
ventions that should be addressed in future to disentangle the e ﬀects of di ﬀerent inter-
vention components. We have also shown that it is viable to use health psychologytools to analyse intervention descriptions in a ﬁeld where an analysis of intervention
functions, theoretical domains and BCTs is severely lacking within employee interven-
tions. Analysing these interventions in this way may enable within a full systematicreview a focussed understanding of the most useful intervention content that could beused in future interventions and address the call for the development of more focussed,
theory-led replicable employee interventions that can clearly articulate what works for
whom and in which context (Costa-Black, 2014; Main & Shaw, 2020). Since psychologi-
cal interventions are complex and can be delivered alongside non-psychological inter-
ventions, additional interventions e.g. related to workplace accommodations (Main &
Shaw, 2020) may also be considered within this evidence synthesis to determine how
diﬀerent types of interventions operate to improve work outcomes.
There are numerous strengths and limitations. One limitation is that only papers pub-
lished in English were included, and so some key papers may have been missed. Secondly,despite our best e ﬀorts we had di ﬃculty accessing the full text for a small number of
studies, and so may have excluded relevant papers., Thirdly, while we were able to de-
risk future work through determining the viability of coding intervention content fortheory and BCTs, in checking only 10% of the papers we did not examine a representativesample of papers. A strength of this research was the use of a comprehensive search strat-
egy which was developed in collaboration with key stakeholders and a subject specialist
librarian. Secondly, the review was conducted by an experienced reviewer. Thirdly, thetitle/abstract and full-text screening was undertaken independently by two authors.
Fourthly, we conducted the ﬁrst test of the viability of using health psychology tools to
analyse intervention content in this context.38 J. L. MCPARLAND ET AL.
Conclusion
There is much variation in the nature and implementation of psychological interventions
for employees with chronic pain. The scoping review has provided a picture of the par-
ameters of psychological interventions for employees with chronic pain. We have ident-
iﬁed patterns and gaps in knowledge to direct future research. We have also shown that it
is possible to use scoping reviews to assess the feasibility of applying tools from health
psychology to identify the active content of psychological interventions for employees
with pain in future systematic review work to improve intervention development inthis heterogeneous ﬁeld.
