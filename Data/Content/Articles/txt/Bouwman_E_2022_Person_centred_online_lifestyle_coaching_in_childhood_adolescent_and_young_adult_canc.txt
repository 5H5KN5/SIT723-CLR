Abstract 
Background: Physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary habits are known to be disadvantageous for the development 
of late adverse effects in survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer. To make interventions, aimed 
at improving lifestyle, fit into the daily life of survivors, interventions should be designed and delivered in a person‑
centred way with a limited time burden. As part of the European PanCareFollowUp project, an eHealth intervention 
was developed to support sustainable changes to physical activity levels and/or diet of childhood, adolescent, and 
young adult cancer survivors. This feasibility study aims to gain insight into the feasibility and potential effect sizes of 
the PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention.
Methods: The PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention consists of person‑ centred 3–6 screen‑to ‑screen sessions with 
a certified lifestyle coach. The intervention will be evaluated with a single ‑arm pre ‑post feasibility study conducted at 
two survivorship care clinics in the Netherlands. A total of 60 participants who are (i) diagnosed with cancer <25 years, 
(ii) ≥ 5 years post ‑treatment, (iii) aged 16–55 years, and (iv) have a low physical activity level and/or unhealthy dietary 
intake manifested by overweight will be recruited. Using reports, hospital records, and questionnaires for survivors, 
coaches, and late effect doctors, feasibility will be based on (i) adherence to intervention, (ii) acceptability, (iii) practi‑
cality, (iv) integration/implementation, (v) demand, and (vi) attrition. The potential effect sizes of the intervention will 
be explored by determining the percentage of survivors that reach the personalized lifestyle goals that were set with

Introduction
Children diagnosed with cancer now have a far better 
prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of over 80% com -
pared to 30% in the 1970s [1–3]. A similar, though slightly 
less dramatic, improvement in successful cancer cures 
can be observed in survivors of adolescent and young 
adult cancer [4, 5]. Therefore, the childhood, adolescent, 
and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivor population 
is rapidly increasing. Currently, there are over 500,000 
CAYA cancer survivors living in Europe and this number 
grows by approximately 12,000 CAYA cancer survivors 
each year [6]. However, due to their cancer treatment, 
CAYA cancer survivors are at high risk for developing 
chronic health and psychosocial problems, also known 
as late effects. These late effects can be severe and often 
result in excess morbidity and mortality compared to 
peers of the same age in the general population [7–10].
An unhealthy lifestyle, for instance characterized by a 
low physical activity level and unhealthy dietary habits, 
increases the already heightened risk of developing late 
effects in CAYA cancer survivors [11–13]. The beneficial 
effects of complying with healthy behaviours are illus -
trated in a study by Jones et  al. in which it was shown 
that adherence to national vigorous exercise guidelines 
(i.e. ≥9 MET hours/week) in Hodgkin lymphoma sur -
vivors was associated with a 51% lower risk of any car -
diovascular event compared with Hodgkin lymphoma 
survivors not meeting the guidelines [11]. Likewise, in a 
study by Schindera et al., higher aerobic fitness has been 
associated with a lower chance of having cardiovascular 
risk factors, such as having a high waist circumference, 
low HDL cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, a 
high composite cardiovascular risk score, and metabolic 
syndrome in childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) [14]. 
Previous research also showed that among survivors 
of childhood leukaemia, a Mediterranean diet, includ -
ing a high intake of fruit and vegetable and a low intake 
of meat, has been negatively associated with having the 
metabolic syndrome, meaning that for each point higher 
on the Mediterranean Diet Score (range 0–8 with 8 rep -
resenting full adherence to the Mediterranean diet), the odds of having the metabolic syndrome declined by 31% 
[15]. For this reason, cancer organizations and cancer 
survivorship guidelines recommend cancer survivors 
to participate in regular physical activity and maintain a 
healthy diet [16].
However, despite these evidence-based recommenda -
tions, CAYA cancer survivors often fail to meet them. 
Several studies have reported that intakes of fibre, fruit, 
and vegetables are often inadequate in survivors [17–19], 
whereas other studies report a high proportion of survi -
vors not meeting the physical activity recommendations 
[19, 20]. Low compliance of CAYA cancer survivors to 
the recommendations may be explained by potential 
physical (e.g. limb amputation, heart failure) and psycho -
logical (e.g. fatigue, depression) late effects due to their 
cancer history and/or treatment regimes. Therefore, 
being physically active and/or complying with a healthy 
diet can be challenging for CAYA survivors [21]. Proper 
guidance in the form of interventions given by healthcare 
professionals with knowledge of late effects and related 
limitations can be helpful for CAYA cancer survivors to 
achieve healthy behaviours.
Delivering interventions according to the concept of 
person-centred care seems a promising approach for the 
heterogeneous population of CAYA cancer survivors [22, 
23]. Person-centred care enables a partnership between 
the patient and their healthcare professional and is 
thought to be an important contributing factor in stimu -
lating self-efficacy and self-management [24]. In addition, 
it ensures that care meets the physical, mental, and social 
health needs of each individual survivor.
Moreover, in order to make the interventions fit into 
the daily lives of CAYA cancer survivors, lifestyle inter -
ventions should be delivered in a way that limits time and 
travel burden as much as possible. For this reason, elec -
tronic health (eHealth) may be an attractive mode of life -
style intervention delivery in this population as it avoids 
unnecessary clinic visits and limits impact on working 
life and care duties for CAYA cancer survivors. Though 
these interventions have not been extensively tested in 
CAYA cancer survivors, Beleigoli et  al. report in their

systematic review that web-based digital interventions 
led to greater short-term weight loss than offline inter -
ventions in overweight and obese adults [25]. In addition, 
in a study by Costello et al. on the delivery of survivor -
ship care via telemedicine, all participating childhood 
cancer survivors would recommend telemedicine to fam -
ily and friends and 94.1% would choose to have another 
telemedicine visit in the future [26].
As part of the European Union Horizon 2020-funded 
PanCareFollowUp (PCFU) project, the PCFU lifestyle 
intervention was developed to support the adoption 
of positive and sustainable changes in lifestyle behav -
iours (i.e. diet and/or physical activity) in CAYA cancer 
survivors [27]. The primary aim of the PCFU lifestyle 
intervention feasibility study is to gain insight into the 
intervention’s feasibility in terms of adherence to the 
intervention, acceptability, practicality, integration, 
implementation, demand, and attrition. The second aim 
is to assess potential effect sizes regarding CAYA cancer 
survivors reaching their personalized goal(s). These goals 
are set together with a lifestyle coach to adapt and sustain 
their desired lifestyle change behaviour. Lastly, short- and 
long-term changes in terms of physical activity level, die -
tary intake, body mass index (BMI), general self-efficacy, 
self-management, and motivation level will be assessed at 
three time points.
Methods
Design and setting
The PCFU lifestyle intervention study—a prospective 
single-arm pre-post feasibility study with three measure -
ment moments (T0 at baseline, T1 after the last session, 
and T2 at 4 months follow-up)—will be conducted at two 
survivorship clinics in the Netherlands: one situated at a university medical centre and one situated at a special -
ized clinic for childhood cancer. After recruitment of sur -
vivors at the clinic, the PCFU lifestyle intervention will 
be delivered remotely through screen-to-screen video 
calling with a lifestyle coach. The coach will provide the 
intervention from a computer at his/her workplace at one 
of the participating clinics or own practice. This study 
protocol will be reported in accordance with the SPIRIT 
guidelines (see Additional file  1) [28] and TIDieR check -
list (see Additional file 2) [29].
Study participants
In total, 60 participants (30 per centre) will be recruited 
for participation in this feasibility study (see the “Sample 
size” section). Eligible participants must meet all of the 
following inclusion criteria at study time: (1) is a survivor 
of childhood, adolescent, or young adult (CAYA) cancer 
(diagnosed with any type of cancer under the age of 25 
years to include most survivors attending the survivor -
ship care clinics); (2) is at least 5 years from the end of 
cancer treatment given that after this period survivors 
make the transition from the oncologists to a long-term 
follow-up at survivorship care clinics; (3) cancer free at 
time of the study; (4) is aged 16–55 years at time of inclu -
sion given that this age group is most likely to be inde -
pendent regarding dietary patterns as well as acquainted 
with video calling software; (5) not meeting the World 
Health Organization (WHO) norm for physical activ -
ity (exercising ≥150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic 
physical activity per week or ≥75 min of vigorous-inten -
sity aerobic physical activity per week or an equivalent 
combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activ -
ity, and should also do muscle-strengthening activities 
at moderate or greater intensity that involve all major

muscle groups on 2 or more days a week) and/or has an 
unhealthy dietary intake manifested by overweight (BMI 
≥ 25 kg/m2) (see Table  1); and (6) is motivated to change 
unhealthy lifestyle behaviour(s) according to the crite -
ria of the RICk (readiness, importance, confidence, and 
knowledge) criteria [30] as assessed by the late effect doc -
tor. Excluded are survivors who meet at least one of the 
following criteria: (1) diagnosed with Down syndrome, 
(2) diagnosed with cognitive disorders, (3) has depressive 
symptoms as assessed with anamnesis by the late effect 
doctors and/or by the Hospital Anxiety and Depres -
sion Scale (anxiety and/or depression score ≥8), (4) is 
diagnosed with complex endocrine disorders that might 
influence weight or other conditions that limit the sur -
vivor’s ability to engage in health promotion discussions 
and activities, (5) is already participating in an interven -
tion study or other interventions aiming to improve life -
style behaviours, (6) is underweight (BMI ≤ 20 kg/m2), 
or (7) has severe physical limitations which will hinder 
proper participation in the intervention as assessed by 
the late effect doctor. Lastly, to assess the feasibility of the 
PCFU lifestyle intervention, the lifestyle coaches and late 
effect doctors will be asked to complete several question -
naires as well.
Participant recruitment will take place at two survi -
vorship care clinics. On arrival at the survivorship care 
clinic for a routine follow-up visit, a healthcare profes -
sional (e.g. a nurse or physician assistant) will perform a 
weight and height measurement of the survivor to deter -
mine the survivor’s BMI as part of routine clinical care. 
The late effect doctor and/or nurse practitioner will be 
provided with this information prior to the start of the 
consultation which will serve as a conversational opener 
to discuss the survivor’s lifestyle behaviours, includ -
ing dietary intake and physical activity level. As part of 
screening procedures of the study, the late effect doc -
tor/nurse practitioner will assess the survivor’s compli -
ance with the WHO norm for physical activity using a 
short questionnaire based on the Global Physical Activ -
ity Questionnaire (see Table  1) [31–33]. Depending on 
the survivorship care clinic, the questionnaire will either 
be completed together, or the survivor will complete the 
questionnaire by himself before the consultation. All sur -
vivors will be verbally informed by the late effect doctor 
about the importance of a healthy lifestyle to prevent late 
health effects or improve their health outcomes. Subse -
quently, the doctor will check if the survivor meets the 
eligibility criteria of the PCFU lifestyle intervention. If 
applicable, the doctor will assess, based on the narrative 
of the survivor, the motivation and willingness of the sur -
vivor to change his/her health behaviour(s). Therefore, 
to assess qualification for the intervention, the late effect 
doctor/nurse practitioner uses the following checkpoints according to the RICk criteria: survivor’s readiness to 
change his/her lifestyle, the survivor knows the impor -
tance of changing his/her lifestyle, and the survivor has 
confidence that he/she will be able to succeed in chang -
ing his/her lifestyle and has the knowledge he/she needs 
before participating in a lifestyle intervention [30]. As 
the intervention aims to establish sustainable lifestyle 
changes in survivors, it is important that survivors are 
ready to commit to lifestyle changes.
The late effect doctor will register whether the survivor 
is motivated according to the RICk criteria on the regis -
tration form. In case of a survivor fulfilling the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, he/she will be introduced to the 
intervention and study and given brief information ver -
bally. If the survivor shows interest in participation, he/
she is provided with an information package contain -
ing an information letter and an informed consent form. 
Within 2 weeks after the clinic visit, the survivor will be 
contacted by phone by the local investigator/research 
nurse. During this phone call, the survivor has the oppor -
tunity to ask questions. If the survivor decides to par -
ticipate in the PCFU lifestyle intervention study, he/she 
will be instructed to sign the informed consent form and 
return it to their treating survivorship care clinic using 
a postage paid envelope. When informed consent is 
received by the study team, the survivor will be registered 
for the intervention. Subsequently, to ensure participant 
confidentiality, the survivor will be assigned an identifica -
tion code for all data collected in the study as well as for 
data on sociodemographic characteristics, cancer history, 
and treatment.
PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention
Development
To develop the PCFU lifestyle intervention, an approach 
guided by the 2008 Medical Research Council Frame -
work for the development and evaluation of complex 
interventions was used [34]. Furthermore, a systematic 
review, including two research aims, and two qualitative 
studies were performed to create an adequate evidence 
base. The first aim of the systematic review focused on 
facilitators and barriers of adopting a healthy lifestyle in 
CAYA cancer survivors (i.e. regular physical activity, a 
healthy diet, a healthy body weight, no smoking, limited 
alcohol consumption, no drug use, good sleep habits, and 
limited and protected sun exposure), whereas the sec -
ond review focused on the effectiveness and the effective 
components of eHealth lifestyle interventions developed 
for CAYA cancer survivors. To gain further insight into 
the barriers and facilitators of providing health behaviour 
support to CAYA cancer survivors, we conducted focus 
groups with healthcare professionals from survivorship 
Page 5 of 15
 Bouwman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:260 
 
care clinics across Europe. Lastly, the other qualita -
tive study aimed to assess the facilitators and barriers of 
adopting a healthy lifestyle as perceived childhood cancer 
survivors with a Dutch or another European nationality.
In addition, the protocol of nurse-led video-coaching 
(REVIVER) care interventions, as developed by late effect 
doctors and nurses at the Radboud University Medical 
Centre (Nijmegen, the Netherlands), served as a starting 
point for the development of the PCFU lifestyle interven -
tion [35]. The REVIVER interventions involve coaching 
sessions with CAYA cancer survivors delivered by trained 
nurses via screen-to-screen video calling. The interven -
tions aim to either reduce symptoms of cancer-related 
fatigue, stimulate self-efficacy, or change lifestyle behav -
iours in CAYA cancer survivors.
In order to develop the new PCFU lifestyle interven -
tion, the REVIVER lifestyle intervention has been refined 
using input from experiences of the REVIVER interven -
tions as well as the results of the systematic review and 
qualitative studies. Adaptations have been made on the 
structure of the intake session, coaching sessions, and 
reflection session in terms of items discussed during the 
sessions and planning of the sessions. In addition, con -
textual factors such as training of the coaches have been 
adjusted. Lastly, the intervention will be evaluated on 
other outcomes with other evaluation measures com -
pared with the REVIVER intervention to capture the 
potential effect sizes and feasibility of the PCFU lifestyle 
intervention.
Concept
The goal of the PCFU lifestyle intervention is to promote 
the adoption of sustainable changes in lifestyle behaviour 
in CAYA cancer survivors with the long-term goal of pre -
venting cardiovascular, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal 
diseases. The intervention targets CAYA cancer survivors 
with a low physical activity level and/or an unhealthy 
dietary intake manifested by overweight (BMI ≥25). The 
PCFU lifestyle intervention elaborates on the concepts of 
person-centred care which aims to empower survivors to 
take charge of their health. In addition, the intervention 
applies multiple behaviour change techniques (see Addi -
tional file  1) and involves synchronous participation by 
survivors and eHealth lifestyle coaches.
Delivery
The PCFU lifestyle intervention is individually and 
remotely delivered through a secure screen-to-screen 
video calling software for online meetings. The applica -
tion and use of the video calling software (Zaurus® or 
Skype for Business®) is free of charge and adheres to the 
General Data Protection Regulation. Therefore, the survi -
vor needs to be in the possession of a smartphone, tablet, or computer. The survivor can participate either at home 
or at another desired location with a secure and stable 
internet connection. During the intervention session, the 
lifestyle coach makes use of two screens, which enables 
the coach to share one screen with relevant information 
with the CAYA cancer survivor (e.g. websites with infor -
mation on physical activity and/or dietary intake).
The intervention will be delivered by lifestyle coaches 
affiliated with one of the two centres and in the posses -
sion of certificates for lifestyle coaching. Both coaches 
are trained in person-centred care by a person-centred 
care expert of the Radboud University Medical Centre 
(Nijmegen, the Netherlands). This centre has been certi -
fied by Planetree International for excellence in person-
centred care. In addition, both coaches are trained for 
the intervention and qualified for applying motivational 
interviewing. Lastly, as CAYA cancer survivors are a 
unique population with specific needs, the coaches are 
either trained in late effects by doctors with expertise in 
this field or had already years of working experience in 
the field of survivorship care.
Content and structure
To support CAYA cancer survivors in adopting a health -
ier lifestyle, multiple behaviour change techniques are 
applied by the coach in the PCFU lifestyle intervention. 
These behaviour change techniques with their presumed 
mechanisms of action are described in the table in S1 
Table [36, 37]. In addition, the intervention coach uses 
principles of person-centred care (i.e. listening to the 
wishes and preferences of the CAYA cancer survivor) to 
establish a partnership between the CAYA cancer survi -
vor and the coach.
The intervention consists of an intake session and 3 to 
6 screen-to-screen coaching sessions delivered within a 
period of 3–4 months. Approximately every 2–3 weeks, a 
session will be scheduled according to the preferences of 
the survivor. The exact number, frequency, and duration 
of the coaching sessions depend on the personal prefer -
ences of the participating survivor. The average duration 
of a session will be approximately 30–45 min.
The goal of the intake session is to reach a consensus on 
which unhealthy lifestyle behaviour(s) will be the main 
focus for the upcoming months. Together with the life -
style coach, the participating survivor will set a personal 
goal that he/she would like to reach by the last coaching 
session. This goal can either be focused on increasing 
physical activity and/or adopting healthier dietary habits. 
Considering personal needs and preferences, the coach 
and survivor together decide on the best plan of action. 
This also includes setting smaller, short-term goals. 
Lastly, potential barriers and facilitators for reaching the 
personal health goal are discussed. Subsequently, during 
Page 6 of 15 Bouwman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:260 
the regular coaching sessions that follow, the coach and 
the survivor will go through the following phases in moti -
vational interviewing: (i) engaging with the survivor, (ii) 
focusing on target behaviour and goal setting, (iii) evok -
ing by drawing out the survivor’s intrinsic motivation to 
change, and (iv) planning to make clear goals and plans 
to change behaviours. Each session starts with exploring 
the survivor’s Stages of Change [38], a reflection on the 
past time, and whether the short-term goals—and overall 
goal—have been reached yet. Next, the coach and survi -
vor discuss plans to overcome lifestyle behaviour change 
barriers experienced during the previous weeks (if appli -
cable). If needed, the coach and survivor will, in mutual 
agreement, adjust the plan of action for the survivor to 
reach the overall health goal. During the last (regular) 
coaching session, the lifestyle coach and survivor reflect 
on the intervention, the progress made, and whether the 
overall goal has been reached. In addition, a final reflec -
tion session will be scheduled 4 months ahead. Until then, 
the survivor is tasked to sustain the lifestyle behavioural 
changes made by him-/herself. During the reflection ses -
sion, the survivor’s progress will again be reviewed and 
the coach and survivor discuss strategies on how to make 
sure the lifestyle goals reached are sustainable.
Fidelity
The fidelity of the intervention will be pursued by eval -
uating the self-reported adherence of the coach to the 
intervention protocol. Following every intake, coaching, 
or reflection session, the coach needs to fill in an online 
report including questions on topics that should be cov -
ered during the session. This will serve as a prompt to 
discuss all these items in the sessions. Secondly, fidelity in 
terms of adherence of coaches to the intervention proto -
col will also be reviewed with the PCFU lifestyle interven -
tion evaluation questionnaire of CAYA cancer survivors. 
In this way, it can be checked whether all intended items 
are discussed. Thirdly, fidelity can be assured as the 
involved coaches are trained in person-centred care, 
motivational interviewing, lifestyle coaching, and the 
intervention protocol. Lastly, results by coaches of both 
participating survivorship care centres will also be dis -
played per centre in the main paper to compare results as 
a means to check for fidelity.
Data collection and outcomes
The schedule of enrolment, the intervention, and assess -
ments performed with the PCFU lifestyle intervention 
study are displayed in Fig.  1. The study flow of the PCFU 
lifestyle intervention study is detailed in Fig.  2. All data 
will be stored in an electronic data capture system (Cas -
tor EDC) compliant with all relevant regulations regard -
ing research with servers located in the Netherlands. Data from participating CAYA cancer survivors on can -
cer diagnosis and treatment are entered into the data -
base prior to the start of the intervention (pre-baseline). 
For CAYA cancer survivors, the measurements will take 
place before the intake session at baseline (T0), immedi -
ately following the last session with the coach (T1), and 4 
months after the last session on completion of the reflec -
tion session (T2). For the lifestyle coaches and referring 
late effect doctors, one measurement will take place at 
the end of the study period (T3).
Baseline characteristics
With the CAYA survivor’s consent, cancer- and treat -
ment-related data such as primary cancer diagnosis, 
age at diagnosis, and chemo- or radiotherapies will be 
retrieved from the medical records and entered in the 
study database. Sociodemographic information of the 
participants will be assessed with a standardized ques -
tionnaire including questions on age, educational level, 
employment status, and country of birth. The educational 
level will be scored in the categories “low” , “middle” , and 
“high” according to the Dutch standard education clas -
sification (27). Employment status will be categorized as 
either “unemployed” , “employed” , or “being a student” .
Feasibility evaluation
Feasibility of the intervention as a primary outcome 
measure will be assessed on the following indices: adher -
ence, acceptability, practicality, integration/implementa -
tion, demand, and attrition [39].
Adherence Adherence of CAYA cancer survivors to the 
PCFU lifestyle intervention will be measured by compar -
ing the scheduled appointments for the intervention ses -
sions with the actual attended appointments with survi -
vors. This will be reported in the online database by the 
coach after each intervention session with a survivor. 
Coaches’ reports of the coaching session will be assessed 
to evaluate the adherence to the PCFU lifestyle inter -
vention. The coach will record all made appointments 
for sessions, whether the survivors complied with the 
sessions.
Acceptability Acceptability of the PCFU lifestyle inter -
vention will be self-assessed with questionnaires (devel -
oped by the research team) which include questions on 
satisfaction with the content and delivery of the inter -
vention. This questionnaire will be provided to the par -
ticipating CAYA cancer survivors on completion of the 
reflection session (T2). The lifestyle coaches and referring 
late effect doctors will receive a questionnaire on accept -

the healthcare professionals focus on the general view on 
the referral process (for late effect doctors only), content, 
duration, and amount of sessions.
Practicality Practicality of the PCFU lifestyle interven -
tion in terms of intervention delivery will be measured by 
a self-assessed questionnaire developed by the research team. This questionnaire is provided to CAYA cancer 
survivors at T2 and the lifestyle coaches and late effect 
doctors at T3. In addition, practicality in terms of costs 
of the intervention will be evaluated by applying a micro-
costing approach that seeks to identify the costs of all 
underlying activities of the intervention. Therefore, time 
spent by coaches for tasks related to the PCFU lifestyle Fig. 2 Flowchart of participant recruitment and involvement in the PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention study

 Bouwman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:260 
 
intervention will be collected directly from the coaches’ 
reports. For every consultation, an estimate of the time 
needed to prepare a session, execute, and document a 
session will be collected. In addition, hospital records 
will be utilized to retrieve the salary costs of the lifestyle 
coaches to calculate the costs of the intervention.
Integration/implementation A self-assessed question -
naire will be used to assess the successfulness of the inte -
gration and implementation of the PCFU lifestyle inter -
vention. In this questionnaire (developed by the research 
team), questions on facilitators and barriers and suc -
cesses and failures of the intervention are included. This 
questionnaire will be provided to the CAYA cancer survi -
vors (at T2). The lifestyle coaches and late effect doctors 
will be provided with this questionnaire at T3. In addi -
tion, after every session, potential facilitators and barri -
ers experienced by the survivor with the intervention are 
reported by the coaches.
Demand To assess the demand for the intervention, 
all potential eligible survivors as well as their expressed 
interest in the intervention will be listed using a self-
compiled registration form. Late effect doctors involved 
in referrals to the PCFU lifestyle intervention study will 
be instructed to fill in this form during consultations with 
survivors. It contains questions on whether the survivor 
complies to the eligibility criteria, whether the survivor 
is motivated to change his/her health behaviour(s), and 
whether he/she is interested in the PCFU lifestyle inter -
vention study. The rate of interested survivors compared 
to those eligible survivors can be calculated from this 
registration form.
Attrition Data will be collected on measurements (i.e. 
questionnaires and accelerometers) completed by partici -
pating survivors at all measurement points (T0, T1, and 
T2). In addition, data on when measurements are com -
pleted will be retrieved as well from the study database.
Potential effect size evaluation
In order to evaluate potential effect sizes, all effect meas -
urements (except for motivation level) will be performed 
at T0, T1, and T2. The motivation level will be assessed 
by the lifestyle coach during each coaching session.
Reached lifestyle goals The potential effect sizes of the 
PCFU lifestyle intervention will be determined by eval -
uating the percentage of CAYA cancer survivors reach -
ing their personalized overall goals and sustaining them. 
After the intake sessions, the lifestyle coaches will register the personalized goal, as well as the progress made dur -
ing the next sessions, in the online study database. After 
the last regular coaching session (T1), the coach will 
report whether the survivor has reached his/her lifestyle 
goal (yes/no). After the reflection session (T2), the coach 
reports whether the goal has been sustained (yes/no).
Physical activity Physical activity will be assessed with 
the validated Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-
enhancing physical activity (SQUASH) questionnaire 
which comprises four domains on commuting activities, 
physical activity at work or school, household activities, 
and spare time [40]. CAYA cancer survivors will be asked 
to indicate the number of days per week and the amount 
of time per day they spend on each activity. An indication 
of the effort for commuting and spare time activities will 
be asked as well. At the end, the sum score will be calcu -
lated based on the number of days per week the survivor 
spends at least half an hour on all the reported activities. 
The reliability of the SQUASH questionnaire is shown to 
be fairly reliable and reasonable with a Spearman corre -
lation coefficient for overall reproducibility of 0.58 (95% 
CU 0.36–0.74) and a validity of 0.45 (P = 0.005; 95% CI 
0.17–0.66) in Dutch subjects [40].
In addition to the SQUASH questionnaire, physical activ -
ity levels of participants will also be assessed objectively 
by an accelerometer (Yamax digiwalker SW-200®). The 
Yamax digiwalker SW-200® has shown to be a reliable 
pedometer [41]. The participants will be instructed to 
wear an accelerometer on their belt or waistband for 7 
consecutive days from the moment they wake up until 
they go to sleep. The instrument responds to vertical 
accelerations of the hip during walking and other ambu -
latory movements. The accelerometer will be sent to the 
study participants in an envelope including clear instruc -
tions on how to wear and use it. At the end of every 
measurement day, the respondents will be asked to regis -
ter the type and duration of physical activities performed, 
as well as the number of steps registered by the acceler -
ometer for that day.
BMI As part of care as usual, weight and height are 
measured in every survivor attending the outpatient 
clinic to have an indication of the survivors’ BMI. The 
late effect doctors will use the BMI assessment to assess 
the eligibility of participants for the study. After inclu -
sion, self-reported weight measurements will be used to 
calculate BMI at T0, T1, and T2. Upon reporting weight 
at T0, T1, and T2, the survivor will be instructed to use 
the same scale. Height will be extracted from the medi -
cal records. To validate, self-reported weight at T0 will be 
compared with weight measured at the outpatient clinic.

Dietary intake To assess the quality of diet, the Dutch 
Food Habit Questionnaire, comprising 26 questions on 
the type and/or frequency of consumed products, will be 
used [42, 43]. The questionnaire is subdivided into three 
categories of nutrients and food categories: (i) fat, (ii) 
fibres, and (iii) vegetables and fruit. All items have 2 to 4 
different answer options. Scores on fat, fibres, vegetables, 
and fruit range from 1 to 3, where 1 corresponds to a 
healthy intake and 3 to an unhealthy intake. A total score 
(range 3–9) of the three categories can be calculated with 
the scoring manual.
Motivation level The CAYA cancer survivor’s motiva -
tion level will be assessed during every intervention ses -
sion by the coach. The coach will apply the “Stages of 
Change” model as developed by Prochaska and Di Clem -
ente to assess in which of the following motivation stages 
the survivor is during the intervention sessions: precon -
templation (“not ready”), contemplation (“getting ready”), 
preparation (“ready”), action, and maintenance [38]. In a 
study by Horiuchi et al., partial support was provided for 
the validity of applying the stages of change to regular 
exercise [44].
Self‑efficacy To estimate the CAYA’s cancer survivor 
self-efficacy level, the General Self-efficacy (GSE) scale 
will be used [45]. The questionnaire is comprised of items 
in which survivors are asked to indicate to what extent 
certain situations apply to them in the way they handle 
or act. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale, 
ranging from “completely true” to “completely false” . The 
total score is calculated by adding up the scores of the 
different items. The GSE scale, consisting of 10 items, 
has shown to have good psychometric properties with 
a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85 in Dutch subjects and 0.89 
in German cancer patients [46, 47]. In addition, a meta-
analysis of Luszczynsksa et  al. confirmed the validity of 
the GSE scale with correlations found with social-cogni -
tive behaviours [47].
Self‑management Self-management will be assessed 
with the disease-specific Self-Management Screening 
(SeMaS) questionnaire [48]. The questionnaire, consist -
ing of 25 items in total, screens the survivor’s capabil -
ity in self-management. The items are distributed over 
the subscales control coordination (3 items), own effec -
tiveness (2 items), social support (1 item), coping style 
(9 items), fear (4 items), depression (3 items), and skills 
such as computer skills (3 items). The total score can 
be calculated by adding up the different scores. A study 
by Eikelenboom et al. showed that the SeMaS is a valid 
tool with 31.7% of the variance explained in the Patient 
Activation Measure (PAM-13) instrument [49]. The psychometric characteristics of the subscales coping 
(problem solving) and self-efficacy were acceptable and 
good with a Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency of 
0.70 and 0.86, respectively [49].
Analyses
Sample size
As the primary aim of this study was to assess the feasi -
bility of the PCFU lifestyle intervention, a formal sam -
ple size calculation was not needed. Though there is no 
general consensus on sample sizes in feasibility studies, 
a pragmatic sample size of 30 participants per centre 
(n=60 in total) was chosen [50– 52]. This number will 
allow adequate acceptability, practicality, integration/
implementation, demand, and attrition testing of the 
PCFU lifestyle intervention. A sample size of 60 is real -
istic considering the number of CAYA cancer survi -
vors invited to the survivorship care clinics per month, 
the study running time (20 months), and the assump -
tion of a recruitment rate of 50%. For estimation of 
the potential effect sizes, a sample size of n =60 is also 
sufficient to estimate small to moderate differences in 
pre- and post-intervention and thus to get insight into 
possible effect sizes (and 95% confidence intervals) for 
the dichotomous primary effect measure percentage of 
survivors that reach the personalized lifestyle goals that 
were set with the coach and the continuous secondary 
effect measures level of physical activity, dietary intake, 
BMI, self-efficacy, and self-management. In case of a 
participant withdraws from the intervention study after 
inclusion and completing the T0 measurement, he/she 
will not be replaced by another participant. In case the 
participant withdraws from the study before complet -
ing the T0 measurement, he/she will be replaced by 
another participant when the recruitment period is still 
ongoing.
Data analyses
The feasibility of the PCFU lifestyle intervention will be 
determined by calculating (1) mean scores on acceptabil -
ity questions in the evaluation questionnaire; (2) percent -
ages of participants who would want chose to apply for 
an eHealth intervention again in the future as assessed 
in the evaluation questionnaire; (3) average duration for 
coaches needed to prepare, conduct, and report about 
the intervention sessions; (4) percentages of drop-outs 
and participants participating in all sessions; (5) percent -
age of eligible survivors participating in intervention; and 
(6) percentages of completed measurements. The exact 
success criteria of the PCFU lifestyle intervention study 
are displayed in Table  2 and will allow us to interpret 
Page 11 of 15
 Bouwman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:260 
 
the results and to determine the feasibility of the inter -
vention and study. Other feasibility data on acceptability 
(usefulness and satisfaction with elements of the inter -
vention, experiences with the coach), practicality (costs), 
and integration/implementation outcomes (barriers and 
facilitators of the intervention) will be collected to inform 
a future study and the replication manual, but will not be 
assessed with success criteria.
For exploratory testing of the potential effect sizes 
(and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) of the study, univari -
able and multivariable analyses will be performed. First, 
continuous data will be checked for normality and equal 
variances with normal probability plots and boxplots, 
respectively. For each of the two centres, percentages and 
means (± standard deviation) or medians (interquartile 
range) will be calculated for the baseline characteristics. 
The percentage of CAYA cancer survivors that improve 
their lifestyle on the behaviour(s) that they desire to 
change (yes/no) will be described at T1 and T2. Regard -
ing the secondary outcome measures physical activity, 
dietary intake, BMI, self-efficacy, self-management, and 
motivation level, the mean (± standard deviation) or 
median values (interquartile range) will be calculated at 
T0, T1, and T2. Estimates of differences in the secondary 
outcomes between T0 and T1, T0 and T2, and between 
T1 and T2 will be explored with two-tailed paired t-tests and presented with 95% CIs. Subsequently, mixed models 
for each secondary outcome will be estimated to inves -
tigate the effect of time, centre, anti-cancer treatment 
factors, age at assessment, sex, socio-economic status, 
amount of sessions, motivational change, and baseline 
scores of the lifestyle behaviour variables, on the second -
ary outcomes. A stepwise backward selection procedure 
will be used to determine potential confounding factors. 
First, a full model containing all potential variables asso -
ciated with each of the secondary outcomes will be cre -
ated, after which the magnitude of associations (β) and 
95% CIs will be carefully assessed. Variables with weak 
associations with the outcome measures, as well as wide 
95% CIs, will be removed from the model, leaving vari -
ables with strong associations with the outcomes in the 
model. These are the variables that should be considered 
potential confounding factors for a future trial.

Discussion
It has been shown that the presence of lifestyle risk fac -
tors, including physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary 
habits, increases the already heightened risk of develop -
ing these late effects in CAYA cancer survivors. Interven -
tions aiming at diminishing this risk by altering unhealthy 
lifestyle behaviours into healthy lifestyle behaviours are 
therefore key in the follow-up care for survivors. How -
ever, the heterogeneous character of the CAYA cancer 
survivor population demands a personalized approach to 
follow-up care and interventions. Our hypothesis is that 
the PCFU lifestyle intervention will positively modify 
lifestyle risk factors, self-efficacy, and self-management 
with preservation or improvement of the survivor’s 
health as the ultimate reward. In addition, by applying 
person-centred care, the PCFU lifestyle intervention can 
lead to improved well-being of survivors by empower -
ing them to care for their health by adopting healthy 
behaviours. Evaluating the PCFU lifestyle intervention 
with the proposed feasibility study will help in improv -
ing the content and conduct of the lifestyle interven -
tion in order to be implemented as part of standard care 
across other survivorship care outpatient clinics. In addi -
tion to that, the PCFU lifestyle intervention study has a 
lot of potential as it concerns an eHealth intervention for 
a relatively young population. Showing the feasibility of 
lifestyle support delivered via eHealth can clear the way 
for other distance-delivered eHealth interventions to be 
implemented.
The potential strengths of the PCFU lifestyle inter -
vention are mostly related to the personalized character 
of the intervention following a consultation according 
to the principles of person-centred care. The content 
of the intervention is completely adapted to the survi -
vor’s preferences and needs. In addition, delivering the 
intervention via video calling can relieve survivors from 
unnecessary visits to survivorship care clinics and can 
therefore better fit into the personal lives of survivors.
Although this seems to be a promising approach of 
improving lifestyle behaviours of CAYA cancer survi -
vors, several limitations need to be considered when 
interpreting the results of the PCFU lifestyle study. First, 
online self-reported questionnaires are used. Partici -
pants may use socially desirable answers when filling in 
the questionnaire or may forget activities that they per -
formed. Despite that, as almost all questionnaires used in 
this study are validated and widely accepted, we do not 
believe this to be a problem. Second, we chose to apply 
the “Stages of Change Model” of Prochaska and DiCle -
mente for both intervention purposes as well as an out -
come measure. However, a limitation of this model is the 
fact that boundaries between the “stages” are rather arbi -
trary selected and therefore it may be difficult for coaches to assess the appropriate stage of change in survivors 
during the intervention. However, as the lifestyle coaches 
are trained in using the “Stages of Change” , we believe 
they can still assess these stages properly. In addition, we 
believe that this feasibility study will also provide input 
on the usefulness of applying the “Stages of Change” as 
part of the intervention or as an outcome measure for the 
future. Third, as the GSE scale will only provide info on 
the survivor’s self-efficacy on a general level, we cannot 
make any statements on potential effect sizes of self-effi -
cacy regarding adopting healthier behaviours. However, 
one of the aims of this intervention is also to empower 
and enhance self-efficacy in survivors in their daily lives. 
Therefore, we believe that the GSE scale will provide us 
valuable information as well. Fourth, for practical rea -
sons, survivors are instructed to weigh themselves at 
home with their own weighing scale. These scales are not 
validated and survivors may not be honest with reporting 
their weight. Yet, as the survivors use the same scale for 
all the three measurements, the effect of the PCFU life -
style intervention regarding weight can still be noticed. 
Fifth, due to time and travel burden for survivors to come 
to the survivorship care clinic at every measurement 
point, height measurements at T1 and T2 cannot be 
conducted by healthcare professionals. For this reason, 
height may therefore not be accurate for the younger par -
ticipants who may potentially have grown between the 
T0, T1, and T2 measurements. Lastly, wearing an accel -
erometer may influence the physical activity patterns of 
the participants leading to a higher physical activity level 
on days where the participants wear them. In addition, it 
only registers vertical movements and no weight bearing 
exercises such as cycling and swimming.
The results of this feasibility study will be used to assess 
both the feasibility and potential effect sizes of the inter -
vention to determine whether a full-scale trial is feasible 
and/or adaptations of the PCFU lifestyle intervention 
are needed in order to proceed with the intervention. 
In addition, the results will, together with the results of 
a systematic review and qualitative studies on barriers 
and facilitators on adopting a healthy lifestyle, inform the 
manual which will be written to disseminate the PCFU 
lifestyle intervention. By publishing the manual, the 
PCFU project aims to help implementation of the PCFU 
lifestyle intervention at other European childhood cancer 
survivorship care clinics.
