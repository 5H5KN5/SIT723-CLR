Abstract
Background: Incorporating evidence-based integrated treatment for dual disorders into typical care settings has
been challenging, especially among those serving Veterans who are homeless. This paper presents an evaluation of
an effort to incorporate an evidence-based, dual disorder treatment called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety
Through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking —Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet) into case management
teams serving Veterans who are homeless, using an implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes (GTO).
Methods: This Hybrid Type III, cluster-randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of GTO over and above
MISSION-Vet Implementation as Usual (IU). Both conditions received standard MISSION-Vet training and manuals.
The GTO group received an implementation manual, trai ning, technical assistance, and data feedback. The
study occurred in teams at three large VA Medical Centers over 2 years. Within each team, existing sub-teams
(case managers and Veterans they serve) were the clust ers randomly assigned. The trial assessed MISSION-Vet
services delivered and collected via administrative data and implementation barriers and facilitators, via semi-
structured interview.
Results: No case managers in the IU group initiated MISSION-Vet while 68% in the GTO group did. Seven
percent of Veterans with case managers in the GTO gro up received at least one MISSION-Vet session. Most
case managers appreciated the MISSION-Vet materials and felt the GTO planning meetings supported using
MISSION-Vet. Case manager interviews also showed that MISSION-Vet could be confusing; there was little
involvement from leadership after their initial agreement to partici pate; the data feedback system had a
number of difficulties; and case managers did not have the resources to implement all aspects of MISSION-Vet.
Conclusions: This project shows that GTO-like support can h elp launch new practices but that multiple
implementation facilitators are n eeded for successful execution of a complex evidence-based program like
MISSION-Vet.

Background
Widespread evidence supports integrating behavioral
health and substance abuse treatments for those who
are dually diagnosed with both mental illnesses and
substance abuse disorders [1]. However, several large-
scale initiatives have demonstrated that it is challenging
to provide integrated care in typical treatment settings
for those who are homeless [2 –5]. For example, a
multi-site study that integrated dual disorders treat-
ment and Housing First found that while overall scores
for Housing First fidelity were high, scores of the item
specifically addressing “Integrated, Stage-wise Substance
Use Treatment ”were rated 3 or lower on a 5-point scale
[5]. In the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), up to
80% of the approximately 48,000 Veterans [6] who are
homeless suffer from mental health and/or substance
use disorders, threatening their housing stability and
leading to higher rates of relapse, treatment dropout,
poor community integration, and utilization of costly
emergency and inpatient services [7]. This paper pre-
sents a cluster-randomized trial of a specific implemen-
tation strategy aimed at supporting the use of a complex
integrated dual disorders model for Veterans who have
experienced homelessness.
Experts in dual diagnosis research have carried out
several initiatives attemp ting to document the degree
to which integrated treatments were adopted and im-
plemented. For example, the National Evidence-Based
Practice (EBP) Implementation Project was a non-
experimental effort to use in- person consultant/trainers
for 2 years to help 53 public-sector community mental
health agencies adopt two of five EBPs for those with
serious mental illnesses (SMI), one of which was an in-
tegrated dual disorder model. Although the sites did
improve their fidelity, only 18% of the sites who chose
the integrated treatment model had high fidelity [2, 3].
Other large-scale initiatives that employed similar im-
plementation strategies found similar results [4, 5].
Building upon these contributions, more research is
needed to specifically test implementation strategies in
settings that serve those who are not only dually diag-
nosed but also homeless.
An ideal setting for such research is the VA program
called HUD-VASH (Housing and Urban Develop-
ment —Veteran Affairs Supporti ve Housing). Veterans
at all VA medical centers who are homeless can receive
subsidized housing from HUD and VA case manage-
ment. In 2012, HUD-VASH adopted the Housing First
philosophy, which states that individuals do notneed to
demonstrate complete sobriety in order to receive
housing and case management services. In addition,
HUD-VASH recently accepted a significant number of
new Veterans to help support the goal of ending home-
lessness among Veterans by 2015 [7], straining availableresources, especially staff. Both changes increased the
number of Veterans in HUD-VASH with a need for in-
tegrated treatment for both substance abuse and mental
health diagnoses.
Although many evidence-based integrated treatment
models are available, one in particular —Maintaining In-
dependence and Sobriety through Systems Integration,
Outreach, and Networking —Veterans Edition (MIS-
SION-Vet) —was developed specifically for homeless or
formerly homeless Veterans [8, 9]. MISSION-Vet is a
manualized, integrated, co-occurring disorder treat-
ment model grounded in the Health Belief Model [10].
In MISSION-Vet, a Veteran, case manager, and “peer
specialist ”work together for about 2.5 h a week. Peer
specialists are individuals who have recovered from
their own mental health and substance issues and are
trained to provide support to others with the same dif-
ficulties [11]. Wide-scale implementation of MISSION-
Vet in HUD-VASH has not occurred, despite a strong
evidence base, the fact that both share a Housing First
treatment philosophy [12], and free, web-based training
and manuals. While implementation models such as
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Re-
search (CFIR) [13] show that research efficacy, concrete
tools, and compatibility with host sites are important
factors that facilitate implementation, these factors
alone are usually not sufficient to promote adoption by
settings like HUD-VASH [14]. Because systems fre-
quently do not adopt new practices even when they are
known to improve outcomes [15], innovative strategies
are needed at both individual and organizational levels
to encourage adoption.
To facilitate the adoption of MISSION-Vet within
HUD-VASH, we employed and then tested the Getting
To Outcomes (GTO) approach [16], modified for use
within the VA [17]. GTO is both an implementation
model —specifying steps pract itioners should take
when carrying out an EBP —and an implementation
strategy , providing ongoing implementation training,
technical assistance, and data feedback to improve
practitioners ’capacity to complete those steps [18].
GTO has been found to improve the capacity of indi-
vidual drug and teen pregnancy prevention practi-
tioners and the performance and fidelity of prevention
programs in both quasi-experimental [18] and ran-
domized controlled trials [19 –2 2 ] .H o w e v e r ,m o s to f
those studies involved non- evidence-based programs.
This study is the first to empirically test a version of
GTO in the VA with a rigorous design and also the
first instance GTO was used to support an EBP in a
clinical setting. We received funding from the VA
Quality Enhancement Research Initiative to compare
MISSION-Vet implementation with and without GTO
support in three large VA HUD-VASH sites.Chinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:34 Page 2 of 12

controlled trial assessing the impact of GTO over and
above MISSION-Vet Implementation as Usual (IU).
Both conditions received standard MISSION-Vet train-
ing and access to the MISSION-Vet treatment man-
uals, but only the GTO group received implementation
support. The study was conducted in HUD-VASH
teams at three large VA Medical Centers over a 2-year
period (March 2013 to Au gust 2015). Within each
HUD-VASH team, existing sub-teams (case managers
and Veterans they serve) were the clusters randomly
assigned, which is particularly appropriate when desir-
ing to lessen the risk of experimental contamination of
the implementation strategy [23]. With support from
study staff and technical assistance, each of the GTO
groups was able to fund two peer specialists. Necessi-
tated by the scope of the study, this structure repre-
sents an adaptation to the MISSION-Vet model, where
typically equal numbers of peer specialists and case
managers are used to form treatment dyads.
Although Hybrid Type III trials do collect clinical
outcome data, they primarily focus on the “utility of an
implementation strategy ”and measure “adoption of
the clinical treatment and fidelity to it, as well as re-
lated factors (pg. 220) ”[24]. The primary focus of this
paper was to evaluate how much the GTO implemen-
tation strategy facilitated HUD-VASH ’sa d o p t i o na n d
implementation of MISSION-Vet, operationalized as
MISSION-Vet services delivered. These services were
analyzed according to three domains of the implemen-
tation heuristic, RE-AIM [25] (Adoption, Reach, Imple-
mentation; see below). Blinding data collection was not
p o s s i b l e ;h o w e v e r ,M I S S I O N - V e ts e r v i c ed a t aw a sf r o m
secondary sources, described below. We hypothesized
that the GTO group would have greater Adoption,
Reach, and Implementation compared to the IU group
overall and at each site. To better understand the con-
text for implementation, we interviewed HUD-VASH
stakeholders about MISSION-Vet barriers and facilita-
tors based on CFIR. As a Hybrid Type III study, a sec-
ondary focus was on the mental health and substance
abuse outcomes of the participating Veterans. These
were documented by case managers via the VA ’se x i s t i n g
HUD-VASH data monitoring system and will be reported
in a separate paper.
The VA Central IRB that oversees multi-site trials
granted approval for this study in October of 2011.
The study received a waiver of consent to use
Veteran-level data from the HUD-VASH data man-
agement system. Harms of GTO were monitored by
s t u d ys t a f fd u r i n gt h et i m es p a nG T Ow a sa c t i v e .
None were reported.Participation sites and recruitment
Site composition
At the time of the study start, the size of the three
HUD-VASH teams were: team 1 (450 Veterans receiving
HUD-VASH housing vouchers and 18 case managers),
team 2 (850 Veterans receiving HUD-VASH housing
vouchers and 27 case managers), and team 3 (810 Vet-
erans receiving HUD-VASH housing vouchers and 24
case managers), for a total of 2110 Veterans receiving
HUD-VASH vouchers and 69 case managers. A housing
voucher is a subsidy a Veteran receives from HUD that
they can use to offset a portion of their rent. Each team
is made of two sub-teams of case managers, which were
randomized to IU or GTO by the team statistician using
a random number generator. The PIs (DS, MC) informed
each sub-team of their randomization status. Randomizing
within team holds constant the variation due to team-level
characteristics, funding streams, regulations, data collec-
tion activities, and political climates. The three HUD-
VASH teams were selected based on their willingness to
participate and their similarity. For example, 85 –95% of
each team ’s vouchers were in active use (Veteran living in
an apartment). Data compiled by the VA ’s Northeast Pro-
gram Evaluation Center shows that, on all three teams, all
Veterans get at least one contact per month, the HUD-
VASH minimum. Approximately 90% of the Veterans on
all three HUD-VASH teams have substance use and/or
mental health diagnoses according to reports of the VA
Homeless Network Coordinators at those sites. Add-
itionally, each of these teams report that approximately
75% of their Veterans receive other services at the VA or
in the community beyond standard HUD-VASH case
management services.
HUD-VASH case manager and Veteran recruitment
The research subjects were the HUD-VASH case managers
and peer specialists, but the case managers also recorded
data about the Veterans on their caseloads in the VA ’s
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). All case
managers were invited to participate and verbally con-
sented before randomization. Ten refused to participate
(n= 3, 3, and 4 across teams 1 –3, respectively); leaving 22
in the IU group and 37 in the GTO group (see Table 3 for
team and study condition level sample sizes). A case man-
ager and their total case load of Veterans were assigned to
study condition based on the case managers ’team assign-
ment to GTO or IU. All HUD-VASH case managers in
both groups were invited to the webinar training on
MISSION-Vet. After MISSION-Vet began, the case man-
agers and peer specialists had the opportunity to deliver
MISSION-Vet services for up to 1 year to any Veteran
who met the following: (1) had a current substance abuse
or dependence disorder and a co-occurring mental illness
and (2) was willing to receive MISSION-Vet services.Chinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:34 Page 3 of 12
The evidence-based program: MISSION-Vet
The core service components of MISSION-Vet are crit-
ical time intervention (CTI), weekly sessions delivered
by a case manager using dual recovery therapy (DRT),
and structured and unstructured peer specialist ser-
vices. The MISSION-Vet Treatment Manual provides
guidance to case managers/peer specialists, and the
MISSION-Vet Consumer Workbook provides home-
work assignments, readings, and checklists for Veterans.
In several studies, including a randomized matched at-
tention control trial, MISSION-Vet has demonstrated
efficacy in increasing treatment engagement, improving
mental health and substance abuse outcomes, and redu-
cing ER visits, re-hospitalizations, and recurring home-
lessness [26 –29]. More details about MISSION-Vet are
available in this project ’s protocol paper published in
Implementation Science [30].
GTO implementation model and strategy
Getting To Outcomes (GTO) is a strategy that builds
capacity for implementing EBPs by strengthening the
knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to choose, plan,
implement, evaluate, and sustain EBPs. GTO helps prac-
titioners address 10 key steps (Table 1) needed to obtain
positive results: steps 1 –6 for planning EBPs, steps 7 –8
for process and outcome evaluation, and steps 9 –10 on
the use of data to improve and sustain programming.
Implementation of these 10 steps is facilitated by
three types of assistance: the GTO manual of text and
tools published by the RAND Corporation [31] which
was specifically tailored to VA homeless services [32],
face-to-face training, and on going technical assistance
(TA). The goal is to help practitioners and leadership
integrate the practices GTO specifies into routine op-
erations and work collaboratively to tailor the EBP to
local conditions. Consisten t with social cognitive the-
ories of behavioral change [33, 34] and implementation
science theories such as CFIR, the GTO supportsenhance knowledge about GTO-related activities,
which improves attitudes towards these activities,
which in turn, improves execution of GTO-specified
tasks, which supports the strong implementation of
EBP needed for achieving outcomes [35]. For details
about how GTO operationalizes CFIR, see Acosta et al.
[19] and Smelson et al. [30].
Use of GTO to facilitate MISSION-Vet in HUD-VASH
Each GTO sub-team created a “GTO Planning Team ”of
HUD-VASH staff (led by a designated point of contact)
and the GTO TA staffperson (SM, in Pittsburgh) who
lead the sub-team through the GTO process. The key
GTO supports were as follows:
(1)Manual of tools —each team received the manual
Getting To Outcomes in services for homeless
Veterans: 10 steps for achieving accountability [32],
developed from a pilot project at the Pittsburgh VA
Homelessness Center [ 17]. Like all GTO manuals,
it provides guidance about how to complete several
“tools”or worksheets that prompt practitioners to
m a k e ,a n dt h e nr e c o r d ,d e c i s i o n sa b o u tv a r i o u s
tasks prescribed by the GTO 10 step model.
(2)Training —study staff (DS, MC, SM) conducted
an in-person, 6-h training with each sub-team on
how to use GTO to plan, implement, evaluate,
and conduct quality imp rovement on MISSION-
Vet. The MISSION-Vet webinar was conducted
by DS a few weeks after the GTO training.
(3)GTO technical assistance (TA) —GTO TA is similar to
“facilitation ”in the implementation science literature
[36]. Like facilitation, GTO TA emphasizes change in
work practices through encouragement and action
promotion via regular, ongoing meetings [ 37,38].
Typically, GTO TA providers guide practitioners
to use GTO-based tools to implement an EBP.
After feedback from HUD-VASH staff indicated
that completing the tools was overly time-consuming,
an adaptation was made so that most of the activities
that GTO prescribes (and that the tools address)
were completed informa lly during team meetings
with the GTO TA staffperson. However, all teams
did complete the GTO Goals Tool, which facilitates
setting service delivery benchmarks. The TA
staffperson met by phone, bi-weekly for 18 –23
months with each GTO Planning Team. HUD-
VASH team leaders were invited, and those from
teams 1 and 2 participated regularly; the team 3
leader participated rarely. As is typical in GTO
projects [ 18,21,39], the TA staffperson received
implementation supervision via weekly meetings
with experts in the EBP (MISSION-Vet, DS) and
GTO (MC), respectively. Initial meetings focusedTable 1 Ten GTO steps and information in the manual

on setting goals and performance targets, tailoring
MISSION-Vet for HUD-VASH teams, identifying
any gaps in skills required by MISSION-Vet,
and arranging additional training. Later meetings
involved reviewing performance data and
troubleshooting imp lementation. The TA
staffperson (SM) visited team 1 twice, team 3
four times, and team 2 only once (for initial
training) due to VA travel restrictions. The hours
of TA for each team, as recorded in log by the
TA staffperson, were 59, 34, and 35 h for teams
1, 2, and 3, respectively. While teams started and
ended at slightly different times, they averaged
about 1.5 h of technical assistance per month,
or about two meetings of 45 min.
(4)MISSION -Vet service tracking —MISSION-Vet
service data was collected with a CPRS note
template we developed for each team. Data
from the notes were extracted to create feedback
reports for each sub-team that were discussed in
GTO Planning Team meetings approximately
once a month.
Measures and data collection
To document GTO ’s impact on MISSION-Vet ’s Adop-
tion, Reach, and Implementation, we extracted from the
CPRS note templates completed by both groups the fol-
lowing MISSION-Vet services: which DRT sessions, peer
specialist sessions, and Consumer Workbook exercises
were completed; whether the MISSION-Vet Consumer
workbook was provided; whether community activities
were done with a Veteran (e.g., taken to appointment,
NA/AA meetings, recreational events, meetings with
landlords, or other activities); and referrals made to
other services. This data was only collected about case
managers (and their assigned Veterans) who were con-
sented into the study.
In addition to MISSION-Vet service delivery, we in-
vited all case managers and peer specialists from the
GTO group to participate in semi-structured interviews.
The response rates for teams 1, 2, and 3 were 83% ( n=
5), 43% ( n= 7), 55% ( n= 10), respectively. Eighteen case
managers, six supervisory staff, and one peer specialist
were interviewed. The interview protocol was structured
around four of the five CFIR domains: Intervention
Characteristics, Implementation Process, Inner Setting,
and Outer Setting; and the more granular implementa-
tion factors under each domain. Similar to Damschroder
and Lowery ’s use of CFIR to assess context of an imple-
mentation [40], we did not collect individual level infor-
mation appropriate for the Individual Characteristics
domain. Questions were drawn from the generic CFIR
protocol and then tailored to this project. All interviews
were conducted by a doctoral-level researcher whoworked on the project (GH) but was not involved in
the delivery of the GTO assistance. Interviews involved
asking open-ended questions and follow-up probes
about how each domain (and implementation factors
under each domain) was expressed on the team during
MISSION-Vet implementation. All interviews were
digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Data analysis
MISSION-Vet services by RE-AIM factors
RE-AIM states that impact of an intervention should
be judged by the following factors (http://re-aim.org/):
Reach —the proportion of individuals (in this case,
Veterans) who participated in the intervention; Effecti-
veness —the impact of the program on important
outcomes; Adoption —the absolute number or propor-
tion of clinicians or teams that initiated the intervention;
Implementation —the extent to which the interventions ’
components were carried out with fidelity; and Mainte-
nance —the extent to which a program becomes institu-
tionalized or part of the routine organizational practices
and policies. In this report, MISSION-Vet services of
both groups were analyzed to assess how much GTO
impacted Adoption, Reach, and Implementation —i.e.,
domains earlier in the cycle of EBP delivery. Table 2
shows how these domains were operationalized.
For each team, implementation data was collected
from the day on which the first MISSION-Vet note was
entered until the last day of the month in which the
team was formally engaged in the study: team 1 (6/11/
13–7/31/14), team 2 (12/31/13 –8/31/15), and team 3
(4/19/13 –12/31/14). These dates varied due to differ-
ences in how long each team participated in the study.
For the variables of Adoption and Reach, Received any
MISSION-Vet sessions were defined as at least one
MISSION-Vet session. All the other implementation
variables are computed on those Veterans who had at
least twoMISSION-Vet sessions (peer specialist or case
manager). This was to exclude Veterans who received
the MISSION-Vet orientation session but then chose
not to receive MISSION-Vet. Calculations of Reach
included all Veterans with a consented case manager.
This is a conservative measure of Reach because not all
of the Veterans with consented case managers had a
dual diagnosis and, thus, were not appropriate candi-
dates for MISSION-Vet. Although data on substance
abuse and mental illness were available in CPRS, dis-
cussions with case managers suggested that this data
was often inaccurate, so all Veterans were included in
the denominator to calculate Reach. We used Fisher ’s
exact test to compare the GTO and Implementation as
Usual groups with respect to the Adoption and Reach
outcomes. We conducted separate comparisons within
each team and across all teams.Chinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:34 Page 5 of 12
Ratings of CFIR implementation factors
Based on methods used by Damschroder and Lowery
[40], text data from the CFIR-based interviews were used
to make ratings for the individual implementation factors
under the four domains included. The inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria from the CFIR Codebook Template [41]
were used to associate text from the transcripts with CFIR
factors. Text could be associated with multiple factors or
no factor. One analyst (SM) coded the text initially and a
second research associate (GH) reviewed the coding for
accuracy. Any discrepancies in the coded text were dis-
cussed until consensus was reached. Two analysts then
used the text associated with each CFIR factor to rate each
factor on the extent to which it impeded or facilitated im-
plementation of MISSION-Vet. Again, discrepancies in
the ratings were discussed until consensus was reached.
Factors for which there was insufficient text to make a rat-
ing were dropped (leaving 20 of 31 CFIR factors). Taking
into account both the valence (i.e., either facilitating or
hindering) and the strength of each implementation factor,
the rating scale ranges from +2 (most facilitating) to −2(most hindering). Again, discrepancies in ratings were dis-
cussed until consensus was reached.
Results
MISSION-Vet services by RE-AIM domains
Adoption
As shown in Table 3, no case managers in the Imple-
mentation as Usual (IU) group at any study site adopted
MISSION-Vet while 68% (25 of 37) of case managers in
the GTO group adopted MISSION-Vet, a difference that
was statistically significant. Likewise, there was a signifi-
cant difference between the GTO and IU group with re-
spect to the adoption of MISSION-Vet within teams 1
and 2, but not team 3. Teams 1 and 2 had similar rates
of case manager Adoption (100, 92%), much more than
team 3 (39%). Team 1, which had the highest Adoption
among the GTO group (100%), also had the smallest
number of consented case managers in the GTO group
(n= 6). Team 3, which had the lowest Adoption rate
among GTO groups (39%), had the largest number of
consented case managers ( n= 18).Table 2 RE-AIM-based measures of MISSION-Vet service delivery

Reach
No Veterans with case managers in the IU group ( n=5 6 7 )
at any study site received any MISSION-Vet sessions.
Seven percent of Veterans with case managers in the
GTO group ( n= 996) received at least one MISSION ses-
sion. Only 1.7% of Veterans with case managers in the
GTO group received at least half of the available 24 struc-
tured DRT or peer specialist MISSION-Vet sessions. The
differences between the GTO and IU groups with respect
to the Reach outcomes were all statistically significant
when collapsing across all teams, although not all within-
team comparisons were significant. Again, teams 1 and 2
had similar Reach rates, double or more the rates for team
3 across multiple levels of MISSION-Vet received (any,
10%, 25%). As one would expect, the teams with higher
Adoption, also had higher Reach (see Table 3). For all
teams, the percent of Reach declined as the RE-AIM cri-
terion increased (any, 10%, 25%, 50%).Implementation
Across all teams, 73% of Veterans receiving MISSION-
Vet were given the Consumer workbook. Veterans re-
ceiving MISSION-Vet received on average 4.2 DRT ses-
sions, 3.3 peer specialist sessions, 1.5 self-guided
exercises, and referrals to 1.5 of the categories of referral
services. Teams 1 and 3 had similar patterns of case
manager implementation (see Table 4). Team 2 provided
less case manager services to MISSION-Vet Veterans
but more peer specialist services. No team ’s Veterans
received more than half the sessions of any type called
for by MISSION-Vet. Team 1 ’s Veterans received about

Ratings of CFIR implementation factors
In this study, the domain of Intervention Characteristics
addresses characteristics of the MISSION-Vet model
(see Table 5). All teams perceived that the decision to
use the MISSION-Vet model was reached externally to
HUD-VASH (Intervention source), which is typically
an implementation barrier. Teams 1 and 3 found
MISSION-Vet to be complicated to implement while
team 2 was neutral on Complexity. Across all teams,
MISSION-Vet was perceived as highly adaptable, such
that case managers could implement different aspects
of MISSION-Vet in different ways for different Vet-
erans, and this was seen as a major facilitator because
of the flexibility it afforded. Further, all teams rated
Relative Advantage as a facilitator, as case managers
reported that MISSION-Vet offered concrete, useful
ideas for how to treat those with dual diagnoses that
were good additions to their current strategies.
The CFIR Inner Setting domain refers to the setting
where the intervention took place, in this study, the
HUD-VASH teams. At this level, the low relative prioritygiven to implementing MISSION-Vet by the teams ’
leadership, in comparison to the high pressure to house
Veterans quickly, was seen as a major barrier to imple-
mentation across all three study teams. Further, many
case managers found MISSION-Vet was incompatible
with their work on the HUD-VASH team, as urgent
pressure to house Veterans, and large caseload sizes left
case managers with little time for the intensity of pro-
viding MISSION-Vet services. Case managers reported
no positive influence from Incentives or Rewards by
leadership for using MISSION-Vet (negative at two
teams, neutral at another) or by any feedback provided
a b o u tu s eo fM I S S I O N - V e t( n e u t r a la tt w ot e a m s ,
negative at another). Team c ommunications were also
challenging at two of the three sites, especially so for
the one site that hired peers specialists via contract
(not as VA employees), which added an additional level
of communication complexity.
There was only sufficient data available to provide
ratings for two constructs in the Outer Setting domain.
Understanding of patient needs and resources across all
three teams were a positive factor in implementation.
However, staff at team 2 made repeated statements indi-
cating their belief that the MISSION-Vet intervention
was inappropriate for the population they served be-
cause their Veterans were struggling to meet basic
needs (housing, food, and clothing) and were not ready
to address issues related to their dual diagnosis. This
perception was seen as negatively affecting the imple-
mentation of MISSION-Vet on this team.
In the Process domain, planning for implementation —
operationalized by the GTO implementation strategy —
was seen as a strength —as GTO helped organize the
teams, kept them on track, and provided a forum to
troubleshoot implementation. All teams reported signifi-
cant challenges engaging Veterans into MISSION-Vet
treatment, which is reflected in the negative rating on
the Engaging Veterans factor.
Discussion
We presented data assessing the impact of an implemen-
tation strategy (GTO) on the use of a clinical treatment
(MISSION-Vet) in three domains specified by the im-
plementation heuristic, RE-AIM (Adoption, Reach, Im-
plementation). To provide additional context, we also
assessed various factors that could hinder or facilitate
implementation according to CFIR. As hypothesized, the
GTO group had greater rates of Adoption, Reach, and
Implementation than the IU group. Regarding Adoption,
most case managers assigned to GTO attempted
MISSION-Vet, while no case managers in the IU group
did. Given that case managers in the IU group had
zero Adoption, they also had zero Reach and Imple-
mentation. These findings a re consistent with a greatTable 5 CFIR ratings of study teams

deal of research that shows t hat passive approaches to
implementation do not usually result in uptake of new
practices [42]. Although case managers in the GTO
condition attempted to deliver MISSION-Vet more
than IU case managers, they only implemented
MISSION-Vet with a small number of Veterans
(Reach) and delivered a small amount of MISSION-
Vet services compared to what the EBP typically re-
quires (Implementation). The findings regarding the
low level of implementation are different from past
GTO studies [22] but similar to past studies attempt-
ing to facilitate the delivery of integrated dual diagno-
sis treatment, as described above [2 –5]. Compared to
MISSION-Vet, however, the EBP in GTO studies have
been much less complicated to implement —e.g., an
eight-session teen pregnancy prevention program [22].
As we show below, the CFIR ratings highlight the nu-
merous challenges on the teams that made the use of
MISSION-Vet more difficult and some factors which
aided implementation.
Intervention characteristics
Although most case managers appreciated the guidance
and materials of MISSION-Vet, some case managers
found the treatment complicated and confusing. In par-
ticular, some stated that it was challenging to know
when and how to integrate the various components of
MISSION-Vet into the treatment for each Veteran.
MISSION-Vet was adapted quite often, which facilitated
case managers trying it out, but appeared to have made
it“acceptable ”to not implement it in full.
Inner setting
There were several factors associated with the HUD-
VASH setting that made MISSION-Vet implementation
more challenging. First, although approval for introdu-
cing MISSION-Vet was secured from both medical cen-
ter and HUD-VASH levels, there was little leadership
involvement from either level once the project began.
We primarily worked with frontline staff to implement
MISSION-Vet. Without higher level leadership buy-in,
there was little accountability when implementation
lagged or reward for those who did implement. Through
GTO, service delivery goals were established, but leader-
ship did not track performance compared to those goals.
The teams recognized that many Veterans needed more
comprehensive dual diagnosis treatment; however, there
were mixed feelings about whether it was reasonable
for case managers to deliver this treatment given con-
stant pressure to meet goals of housing Veterans within
specified time frames. MISSION-Vet is a comprehen-
sive treatment that requires 2.5 h a week of clinical
time, which was incompatible with the increasingly
large case load size of the HUD-VASH case managers.Another significant challenge was that the data feed-
back system established through the GTO strategy ex-
perienced a number of difficulties which undercut its
effectiveness and impact. First, case managers and peer
specialists did not always use the note template, and it
is likely that more services were delivered than re-
corded for many of those staff. Second, the VA data in-
frastructure made capturing the data extremely difficult
and required searching, accessing, and merging records
across multiple systems. Although the data was checked
f o re r r o r s ,i ti sl i k e l yt h a ts o m ed a t ae r r o r sr e m a i n e d .
Third, because the VA system did not have an easy
mechanism to capture the MISSION-Vet service data,
there were often discrepancies between what case man-
agers reported they were delivering and what the data
reports stated. All together, these circumstances made
the resulting feedback reports less accurate and thus
the case managers were mixed on the utility of the
feedback reports.
Outer setting
Serving patients was a priority for HUD-VASH case
managers, and that facilitated trying MISSION-Vet ac-
cording to the CFIR ratings. Although not officially
rated, two other factors in the CFIR Outer Setting do-
main, Peer Pressure (competition between teams), and
the presence of external policies and incentives may
have been working against implementation. That is be-
cause there was not a large-scale effort within VA to
use MISSION-Vet within HUD-VASH —i.e., there was
little national momentum for its implementation. Thus,
there were no external policies calling for MISSION-
Vet across the VA nor were there any external incen-
tives to deploy it. In the context of President Obama ’s
pledge to end Veteran homelessness by 2015, the incen-
tives were tightly aligned to securing housing.
Implementation process
Ongoing planning meetings of the GTO teams at each
site helped keep the HUD-VASH case managers fo-
cused on trying out MISSION-Vet. The GTO technical
assistance staffperson, who ran those meetings, was
the external change agent. However, case managers re-
ported great difficulty in engaging Veterans to try
MISSION-Vet. As stated, MISSION-Vet is intensive,
and many Veterans in HUD-VASH who have substance
abuse disorders may not have been ready to engage in
such an intensive treatment.
Limitations
Certain limitations should be noted. First, peer specialists
were not available to teams in the IU condition in two of
the three sites. The activation provided by GTO facilitated
peer specialists being added to the intervention (GTO)Chinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:34 Page 9 of 12
teams, but the roll out of peer specialists varied: one team
used contract peer specialists which involved greater com-
plexity and coordination, one team had significant turn
over in their peer specialists during the study, and one
team experienced challenges in peer specialists recording
notes into the templates. In addition, the shortage of peer
specialists in this study meant that the case managers in
all three GTO teams had to “share ”peer specialists, which
is not typical for MISSION-Vet implementation. Second,
we were able to interview only one of the eight peer spe-
cialists who had been involved over time at the three
teams. Third, the data from the electronic medical record
were limited and relied upon case managers, not trained
data collectors. It was not possible to completely confirm
accuracy of the data, although we were able to make some
data corrections by getting feedback from the case man-
agers (via the data feedback process). Fourth, we know
that the services documented underrepresented the actual
amount of services delivered. Case managers and peer
specialists in all GTO sites reported delivering some ser-
vices not recorded on the CPRS note template. Lastly,
using all Veterans on the HUD-VASH sub-teams as the
denominator for calculation of Reach likely made Reach
rates appear lower and could be considered a “lower
bound ”for Reach. That is because not all HUD-VASH
Veterans have a dual diagnosis and would be appropriate
for MISSION-Vet services.
Conclusions
This study suggests that while GTO implementation
support was critical to the launch of MISSION-Vet, this
alone does not equate to service delivery with high fidelity
for a complex intervention like MISSION-Vet. Despite the
support for the launching of MISSION-Vet services, a
constellation of implementation factors on the ground
(highlighted by the CFIR model) exerted tremendous in-
fluence on the amount of MISSION-Vet delivered and
consequently reduced fidelity. This project was launched
right as the VA was tasked to reduce the number of Vet-
erans who were homeless to zero and HUD-VASH had
been asked to adopt a Housing First philosophy (accepting
Veterans into services much earlier in their recovery). As
a result, case managers were under a great deal of pressure
to house more Veterans who had more significant impair-
ments than ever before, which left little room to take on
new initiatives, regardless of their utility. It is possible that
through the GTO approach, more could have been done
to engage leadership levels beyond the team at each site;
however, in the absence of any national momentum or ex-
ternal policies, it was unclear what incentives to leverage.
It could be concluded that MISSION-Vet was not an
optimal fit for the HUD-VASH program at the time this
study was conducted. Nonetheless, while choice in ser-
vice engagement is a core philosophy for homelessclients in Housing First programs, it is also important to
address co-occurring metal health and substance abuse
to prevent housing instability and loss, an area with
which the field is still struggling to optimally deliver sup-
port [43]. Thus, given its evidence base and philosoph-
ical overlap with HUD-VASH, it is possible that under
different circumstances, MISSION-Vet could be success-
ful. Since the end of the trial, the national HUD-VASH
program has funded additional training for Critical Time
Intervention (a key component of MISSION-Vet), multi-
disciplinary teams, and shared caseloads as a way to im-
prove access to a variety of services including integrated
dual disorders treatment. As the study ended, a GTO
team at one of the sites was in the process of creating a
special intensive case management sub-team in which
case managers with very low caseloads would use
MISSION-Vet to treat high-acuity patients. This idea
appears to be more favorable as it has high leadership
support, has high priority, and would be more compat-
ible with the new case load configuration —CFIR factors
that were implementation barriers during the study.
Overall, this project shows that GTO-like support can
help launch new practices but that multiple implementa-
tion facilitators are needed for successful implementa-
tion of an evidence-based program like MISSION-Vet.

Central IRB approval for this study was granted in October of 2011. The
three sites were trained on MISSION-Vet and GTO in the first half of 2013.
The first GTO planning meetings began directly after training occurred,
between January 2013 and November 2013 across the three sites. The
data collection —via a fidelity measure embedded into the VA Electronic
Medical Record System —began as each site initiated MISSION-Vet, between
April 2013 and January 2014 and ended between July 2014 and August 2015.
