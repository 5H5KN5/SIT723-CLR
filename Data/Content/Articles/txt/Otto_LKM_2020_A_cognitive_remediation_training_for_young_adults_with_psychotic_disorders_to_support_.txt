Abstract
Background: Most severe mental disorders have their onset between the age of 17 and 27, a time when many young
adults begin participating in secondary or post-secondary e ducation. The cognitive deficits typically associated with
psychiatric disorders, especially psychotic disorders, in crease the risk of leaving school early, which can lead to a
reduction in employment opportunities later on in life and, in turn, a poorer long-term prognosis. Therefore, specific
interventions aiming to improve these cognitive functio ns are needed. Cognitive remediation (CR) aims to improve
cognitive functioning and may increase real-world function ing in educational performance. This study aims to examine
the feasibility and applicability of a CR training named Mindset for students with psychotic disorders in the Netherlands.
Methods/design: Sixty students diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and currently reporting cognitive deficits will be
included from four Dutch Mental Health Care institutes. Half of the participants ( N= 30) will be randomly assigned to
the CR training consisting of twelve, individual, weekly 1-h m eetings. The other half will be assigned to an active control
condition consisting of twelve weekly assignments that will be sent by email aiming to improve school performance.
Students will be evaluated at baseline (T0), directly after f inishing the CR training or control intervention (T1), and 6
months later (T2). Treatment feasibility will be the primary out come, using evaluation forms, interviews with trainers and
participants, number of study drop outs, and patient eligib ility and recruitment rates. School functioning, cognitive
functioning, and strategy use will also be assessed to get a preliminary idea of the potential effectiveness of the
intervention.

Discussion: The CR training in this study will provide real-world exa mples and exercises aimed to teach useful strategies
to cope with the cognitive deficits experienced by students w ith psychotic disorders. Furthermore, since students with
other psychiatric disorders might also experience cognitiv e deficits, the results of this study may also provide some
further implications for future studies on the effect of this CR training for students with these disorders.

Background
Most psychiatric disorders include having cognitive
problems and have their onset between the age of 17
and 27 [ 1], which is often the period in which many
young adults participate in higher education.
Cognitive deficits are negatively associated with func-
tional outcomes like social functioning, independent liv-
ing skills, occupational functioning, and also level of
educational success [ 2–4].
Between 6 and 20% of the students participating in higher
education experience mental health problems [ 5–8],
and nearly 55% of this group is severely hindered by
their psychiatric disorders during college [ 9]. Research
shows that students with psychiatric problems spend
on average more time on their education per week.
However, they also receive lower grades compared to
students without psychiatric problems [ 10]a n da r ea t
higher risk of early school leaving [ 10,11], which re-
sults in having reduced chances of obtaining employ-
ment afterwards. This reduction in social participation
often leads to worsening of the prognosis of the dis-
order on a long-term basis [ 12]. Offering support to
these students while they ar e enrolled in school might
increase their chances of educational success [ 13]a n d
could mitigate the issues of unemployment and social
isolation seen in the older adult population. The cog-
nitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders
are, compared to other psychiatric disorders [ 14],
most prominent in people with psychotic disorders
[15,16]. These cognitive deficits are often already
present before the first onset of the psychotic dis-
order [ 17].
One intervention aimed at decreasing cognitive deficits
is cognitive remediation (CR). CR is defined as “a behav-
ioral, training-based intervention that aims to improve
cognitive processes (attention, memory, executive func-
tion, social cognition, or metacognition) with the goal of
durability and generalization ”[18]. Previous studies have
shown that CR has positive effects on almost all cogni-
tive abilities of people with schizophrenia [ 13,19–22],
with considerable variability in effects between studies.Various moderators for the effectiveness of CR were
identified. Previous studies, for example, have demon-
strated that baseline cognition can positively impact the
outcome of CR, with severe cognitive impairment at
baseline resulting in poorer study outcome post-training
compared to moderate cognitive impairments [ 23]. In
addition, medication usage [ 24], gender [ 25], age of on-
set [26], and self-confidence [ 27] have been identified as
moderating factors. In addition, the use of “bridging ac-
tivities ”to daily life, like supported employment, has
been shown to be more effective than cognitive training
alone [ 28].
Most studies on the effects of CR have focused either
on cognition [ 29,30] or cognitive functioning in an em-
ployment context [ 19–21,31–34] in people with schizo-
phrenia. These studies indicated that CR improves
cognitive functioning, especially when combined with
supported employment [ 19–21,35].
Positive results have been associated with young
adults; specifically, young adults have more cognitive im-
provements after CR [ 36–38], which could be possibly
explained by brain plasticity in young adults early in the
course of the illness [ 39,40]. Offering CR to young
adults might therefore lead to better results as compared
to older adults with more chronic forms of psychotic
disorders [ 39,40]. The few studies that have focused on
CR for adolescents or young adults with psychotic disor-
ders in an educational setting [ 13,41,42] demonstrated
a positive effect on cognition [ 42], academic functioning,
and self-esteem [ 13], as well as a decrease in self-
reported academic difficulties [ 41].
A CR for young students with a psychotic disorder is
not available in the Netherlands yet. This study therefore
aims to examine the feasibility and applicability of a CR
training in an educational setting for students with
psychotic disorders. To do this, a CR training developed
by Mullen and colleagues [ 41] was translated to Dutch,
adapted to the Dutch context, and was named Mindset.
Mindset will be studied as a pilot randomized controlled
trial at four mental health care (MHC) services in the
Netherlands.Otto et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:54 Page 2 of 8
Methods
Participants
Sixty students will be recruited from four Dutch Mental
Health Care services (in Dutch: Geestelijke Gezond-
heidszorg; GGz), namely GGz Drenthe, GGz Friesland,
Lentis Groningen, and the University Center of Psych-
iatry (UCP), Groningen. The recruitment will be done
by MH professionals, who will distribute information
brochures at the participating MHC institutions. Inclu-
sion criteria are (i) receiving treatment from an Early
Intervention Psychosis team of one of the participating
MHC services; (ii) officially diagnosed with a psychotic
disorder by one of the participating MHC services; (iii)
self-report of cognitive deficits which interfere with the
ability to participate in coursework; (iv) aged above 18;
(v) participating in mainstream postsecondary education:
intermediate vocational education, higher vocational
education, or university; (vi) at least 1 year remaining in
education after start of the training or control interven-
tion, and (vii) able to give written informed consent. Ex-
clusion criteria are (i) having participated in a supported
education or cognitive remediation program in the past
year and (ii) having an estimated IQ < 75 (identified by a
MH professional). Daily treatment of the participants
will be unchanged.
Sample size calculation
Sample size calculations are not applicable since the
study focuses on the feasibility and applicability of the
cognitive remediation training. According to the litera-
ture, a sample size of 25 to 30 per group should be suffi-
cient to estimate moderate effect sizes in a pilot test for
adequacy and acceptability of the instruments using α=
0.5 [ 43,44]. We therefore aim for 30 participants per
group. Participants will be recruited from the four par-
ticipating sites providing variation in demographic and
clinical characteristics useful for conclusions on general
feasibility.
Study procedures
The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for
Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 checklist [ 45] was
adhered to and is provided in Additional file 1. After
study procedures have been fully explained, participants
will provide written informed consent and will then be
randomized into either the CR training or the active
control group (see SPIRIT 2013 Fig. 1).
Feasibility, applicability, and exploratory efficacy out-
comes will be assessed at baseline (T0), upon completion
of the CR training or control intervention (post-treat-
ment; T1), and 6 months after T1 (follow-up; T2). The
written evaluation forms for fidelity and feasibility will
be completed by the trainers after each session. Evalu-
ation interviews will be held at the end of the training(T1) with both participants and trainers and will be per-
formed by the researcher involved.
Half of the participants will receive the CR training
(intervention group), whereas the other half will receive
study assignments without additional support (control
group). Participants in the control group are offered
Mindset 1 year after the experimental group completes
the intervention. Participants will receive compensation
(three times gift coupons of 12.50 euro each) for filling
in the questionnaires at baseline (T0), post-treatment
(T1), and during the follow-up, 6 months after T1 (T2).
Interventions
CR training
The Mindset training is designed to improve the cogni-
tive abilities of students with psychiatric disorders, in-
cluding psychotic disorders, and is aimed at improving
academic outcomes. The training consists of twelve indi-
vidual, 1-h meetings spread over 12 weeks. Personal
educational goals of the participants will be formulated
during an introductory meeting (session zero). The stu-
dents will be asked to relate the skills and strategies
practiced during the training to their own educational
goals. During the training, four cognitive domains will
be targeted: (1) prospective memory, (2) attention and
concentration, (3) verbal learning and memory, and (4)
cognitive flexibility and problem-solving. All sessions fol-
low the same structure: review of last session ’s home ex-
ercises, overview and importance of the current session ’s
topic, practice exercises, and review of new home exer-
cises. The training includes practical strategies such as
agenda usage and paying attention during class, forming
a direct link to educational settings. The trainers are
professionals from the participating MHC services and
received a 4-day training in the CR by the developer of
the original CR training.
Control group
Mindset will be compared to an active control condition
to control for attention. The control group also begins
with a session zero to formulate their educational goals
and will receive twelve weekly assignments via e-mail,
without any face-to-face contact involved. The home as-
signments will take about 1 h to complete. No feedback
will be provided on these assignments. The topics of the
assignments are designed in such a way that they do not
focus on cognitive functions but still provide some edu-
cational support. Examples of the exercises are “request-
ing for support, ”“dealing with stress, ”and “responding
to feedback. ”
Measurements
A full list of measurements and measure points is given
in the SPIRIT flow diagram (Fig. 1).Otto et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:54 Page 3 of 8
At baseline, the following demographic information
will be collected per participant: age, gender, alcohol and
drug usage, cultural background, education (previous
and current), level of education, number of hours spent
on their education per week (i.e., school credit hours
and homework), living arrangements (living with par-
ents/roommate(s)/partner and/or having children), em-
ployment information (number of hours), diagnosis(including age of onset and symptom severity), and
medication use (name and frequency).
Feasibility, applicability, and fidelity outcome measures
The main study outcomes are study feasibility and ap-
plicability and will be measured using an evaluation
form completed by the trainers, an interview with
trainers and participants, and by examining studyFig. 1 SPIRIT flow diagram of the study procedure showing enrolment, interventions, and assessmentsOtto et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:54 Page 4 of 8
dropouts. In addition, patient eligibility and recruitment
rates will be included as a measurement for feasibility
and applicability of the training within this population as
the number of potentially eligible people compared to
the number of actual participants.
Training fidelity will be measured by the previously
described interview and a session evaluation form, which
contains a short checklist of all session components. The
evaluation forms are designed in such a way that the
trainer can provide information on how much of the ses-
sions they have covered per exercise. The form also al-
lows the trainer to provide feedback for each exercise
within the session, as well as general feedback about the
session. The fidelity measurements will provide greater
understanding and description of how the training cri-
teria have been attained, or why they may not have been
attained.
The evaluation interviews will be semi-structured,
audio-recorded (with consent), and transcribed. During
the interview, questions like “Which session did you find
most useful? ”and “Are there aspects of the training that
can be, or need to be, improved? ”will be asked. All in-
terviews will be encoded by two independent re-
searchers. The codes obtained from both researchers
will be compared and discussed, resulting in one coding
file for each of the interviews.
Exploratory outcome measures
School- and cognitive functioning will be measured as
exploratory outcomes to get a first impression of the ef-
ficacy of Mindset. To do this, objective and subjective
school functioning, school satisfaction, school self-
efficacy, subjective school functioning, strategy use, and
cognitive functioning will be collected. In addition, infor-
mation concerning interruptions in schooling (like
school dropouts) will be gathered during the interviews.
Objective school functioning
School performance will be calculated as percentage of
courses successfully completed using the following for-
mula:succesfully completed courses
number of courses/C2100%, because the num-
ber of courses will not be the same for all participants.
Therefore, an absolute number will not provide enough
information about the total performance per student.
Subjective school functioning
The Educational Barriers Questionnaire or EBQ (Mullen
MG. Educational Barriers Questionnaire. 2016. Unpub-
lished) will be used to measure self-reported school func-
tioning. The EBQ is a questionnaire including 34
problems students might experience when going to
school, such as problems with “taking notes ”and “priori-
tizing tasks. ”The EBQ uses a 5-point scale, ranging from1 (not at all) to 5 (very often). Total scores on the ques-
tionnaire will be used for analyses, where higher scores in-
dicate experiencing more problems.
School satisfaction
School satisfaction will be measured using the Multidi-
mensional Students ’Life Satisfaction Scale (MSLSS) —
school subscale [ 46]. This subscale consists of nine state-
ments about school satisfaction, for example, “I look for-
ward to going to school ”and “There are many things
about school I don ’t like. ”Respondents are asked to in-
dicate on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (rarely) to 4 (al-
ways) to what extent the statements are applicable to
them. Negative items like “I wish I didn ’t have to go to
school ”will be reverse-scored. Higher scores indicate
higher levels of school satisfaction.
School efficacy
School efficacy will be measured using the College Self-
Efficacy Inventory or CSEI [ 47]. The CSEI is a 22-item
self-reported questionnaire measuring student confi-
dence levels related to their use of post-secondary edu-
cational skills such as “write a course paper ”and “ask a
professor or instructor a question outside of class. ”The
CSEI uses a 9-point scale, ranging from 0 (totally uncon-
fident) to 8 (totally confident). Total scores will be used
for analyses, where higher scores indicate higher confi-
dence levels throughout the scale.
Strategy use and cognitive functioning
Strategy use and subjective cognitive functioning will be
measured using the Cognitive Problems and Strategies As-
sessment, or CPSA [ 32]. This questionnaire contains 35
cognitive problems, such as “Ih a v ed i f f i c u l t yr e m e m b e r i n g
to do things that I have scheduled ”and 30 strategies like
“I keep a written list of things I need to do. ”The CPSA
uses a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (rarely/never) to 3 (al-
ways). Total scores on “cognitive problems ”and on “strat-
egy use ”will be calculated and used for analysis
separately. Higher scores on “cognitive problems ”indicate
having more problems, and higher scores on “strategy
use”indicate using more strategies.
Cognitive functioning
Objective cognitive function ing will be measured using the
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery or
CANTAB [ 48]. The CANTAB includes seven different
modules measuring various neurocognitive functions and
processes, including worki ng memory, episodic memory,
executive function, emotion recognition, cognitive flexibil-
ity, processing speed, and sustained attention.Otto et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:54 Page 5 of 8
Randomization and blinding procedures
Randomization will be done in blocks of four and six
participants, stratified for gender to control for possible
gender effects [ 25]. Participants will be randomly
assigned to either the CR or control condition by an in-
dependent researcher. Assessments will be done by
trained bachelor or master level students in Psychology
or Nursing, supervised by senior psychologists. The as-
sessors are blinded to the conditions of the participants.
Handling and storage of data and documents
Data will be handled confidentially in compliance with
the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act ( Wet Bescherm-
ing Persoonsgegevens ; WBP). Research assistants will as-
sign each participant with a unique identification code.
The key to this code and a subject identification list will
be safeguarded by the project manager. All data will be
stored and locked at the Hanze University of Applied
Sciences Groningen. Raw research data will be stored
until 15 years after finishing the study and will be
destroyed thereafter according to the code of proper use
(“Gedragscode Gezondheidsonderzoek ”;www.fmwv.nl ).
Dissemination
Dissemination of the results of the project will take place
through scientific publication(s) in (inter)national peer-
reviewed journals; presentations and workshops during
national and international conferences of associations of
educational staff, mental health workers, and rehabilita-
tion specialists; a closing symposium; online introduc-
tory course on Supported Education for mental health
professionals, students, and educational professionals;
newsletters; and social media (LinkedIn groups, Twitter,
Facebook, etc.).
Proposed analyses
Analyses will be performed according to the “intention
to treat ”(ITT) principle. Descriptive statistics will be
provided for all normally distributed variables in the
form of mean scores and standard deviations for each of
the assessment instruments. Descriptive statistics of vari-
ables that are not normally distributed will be repre-
sented as median scores and ranges. Data from the
interviews will be qualitatively analyzed. Differences in
the quantitative outcomes will be examined for T0 to T2
using repeated measures of variance with the MANOVA
test using 95% confidence levels providing estimates of
potential treatment effects since real significance and hy-
pothesis testing is not applicable for a pilot study.
Discussion
Cognitive remediation (CR) has shown positive effects
across almost all cognitive domains [ 13,19–21]. How-
ever, it should be noted that most of the previous CRresearch was conducted among samples of older adults
with mean ages that ranged between the 30 and 47 years
[19,22] and were focusing on cognitive functioning in
an employment context [ 19–21,31–34]. Most cognitive
skills needed for employment are also necessary for edu-
cational success. Furthermore, successfully completing
one’s education influences one ’s future perspective on
employment and consequently on one ’s social inclusion.
Decreased social inclusion can lead to a poorer progno-
sis [12], warranting for interventions like CR in an edu-
cational setting. However, CR in educational settings is
still studied by only a few [ 13,41,42].
In addition, young adults in the early phase of illness
may have greater brain plasticity, which is needed for re-
covery and learning. Offering CR to students aged be-
tween 17 and 27 might therefore lead to better results as
compared to older adults with a more long-term psych-
otic disorder [ 39,40].
This study will test the feasibility and applicability of a
CR training named Mindset for students with psychotic
problems in the Netherlands. Mindset incorporates prac-
tical strategies such as agenda usage and paying atten-
tion during class, forming a direct link to educational
settings. The use of these “bridging activities ”has been
shown to be more effective than cognitive training [ 28].
Although this is a pilot study with a relatively small
sample size, the results of this study will provide a good
basis for further research on CR in the context of educa-
tion. Furthermore, because cognitive deficits are not only
seen in students with psychotic disorders, but also in
students with other psychiatric disorders [ 2,3,35], the
results of this study might also provide some implica-
tions for further studies on the effect of CR on students
with other psychiatric disorders.
