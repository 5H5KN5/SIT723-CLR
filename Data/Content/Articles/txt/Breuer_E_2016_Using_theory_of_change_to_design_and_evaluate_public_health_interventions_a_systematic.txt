SYSTEMATIC REVIEW Open Access
Using theory of change to design and
evaluate public health interventions: a
systematic review
Erica Breuer1*, Lucy Lee2, Mary De Silva2and Crick Lund1
Abstract
Background: Despite the increasing popularity of the theory of change (ToC) approach, little is known about the
extent to which ToC has been used in the design and evaluation of public health interventions. This review aims to
determine how ToCs have been developed and used in the development and evaluation of public health
interventions globally.
Method s:We searched for papers reporting the use of “theory of change ”in the development or evaluation of
public health interventions in databases of peer-reviewed journal articles such as Scopus, Pubmed, PsychInfo, grey
literature databases, Google and websites of development funders. We included papers of any date, language or
study design. Both abstracts and full text papers were double screened. Data were extracted and narratively and
quantitatively summarised.
Results: A total of 62 papers were included in the review. Forty-nine (79 %) described the development of ToC, 18
(29 %) described the use of ToC in the development of the intervention and 49 (79 %) described the use of ToC in
the evaluation of the intervention. Although a large number of papers were included in the review, their
descriptions of the ToC development and use in intervention design and evaluation lacked detail.
Conclusions: The use of the ToC approach is widespread in the public health literature. Clear reporting of the ToC
process and outputs is important to strengthen the body of literature on practical application of ToC in order to
develop our understanding of the benefits and advantages of using ToC. We also propose a checklist for reporting
on the use of ToC to ensure transparent reporting and recommend that our checklist is used and refined by
authors reporting the ToC approach.
Keywords: Theory of change, Intervention development, Evaluation, Programme theory, Public health, Systematic

Background
Most public health interventions are inherently complex,
with multiple interacting components, delivered at mul-
tiple levels. This complexity makes them difficult to
evaluate using traditional experimental designs. Public
health interventions often rely on ongoing quality im-
provement based on the implementation experience.
Therefore, they may not reach the level of stability re-
quired to conduct evaluations such as randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs) [1]. Some researchers propose
that understanding the public health intervention ’s
underlying theory of change (ToC) and its related uncer-
tainties may improve the evaluation of complex health
interventions [1 –3].
Theory-driven evaluation is a collection of evaluation
methods which emphasise the importance of under-
standing how and why a programme works in order to
evaluate it [4, 5]. By programme, we mean a set of orga-
nised activities or interventions supported by resources
designed to achieve a specific result [6]. The theories are
first made explicit and then used to see how the
programme theory results in the intended outcomes [4].* Correspondence: erica.breuer@uct.ac.za

There are several overlapping types of theory-driven
evaluation approaches including logic models, logical
frameworks, outcomes hierarchies, realist evaluation,
and ToC [4, 5].
ToC was developed by Weiss and others [7] within
the tradition of theory-driven evaluation. Although
definitions of ToC vary, we define it as an approach
which describes how a programme brings about spe-
cific long-term outcomes through a logical sequence
of intermediate outcomes [8]. The ToC is often devel-
oped using a backward mapping approach which
starts with the long-term outcome and then maps the
required process of chang ea n dt h es h o r t -a n d
medium-term outcomes required to achieve this [9].
During this process, the assumptions about what
needs to be in place for the ToC to occur are made
explicit as well as the contextual factors which influ-
ence the ToC. Additional elements of a ToC can in-
clude beneficiaries ,research evidence supporting the
ToC,actors in the context ,sphere of influence ,stra-
tegic choices and interventions ,timelines and indica-
tors [8]. These elements are usually presented in a
diagram and/or narrative summary [8].
The ToC is usually developed in consultation with
stakeholders through workshops or interviews although
the participation of stakeholders can vary substantially in
practice [10]. For example, some ToCs are developed
through a series of workshops and meetings with a wide
range of stakeholders including service users [11, 12]
whereas others are developed by evaluators and funders
using programme documentation [13, 14]. The resulting
ToCs can be used as a framework for programme devel-
opment and evaluation [8]. The ToC approach is
method neutral and as such does not prescribe specific
types of evaluation methods such as qualitative inter-
views or RCTs [15].
ToC is distinct from sociological or psychological the-
ories which describe why change occurs although these
may be used to inform the ToC [3]. For example, Bauer
used an ecological model of community organising to
inform a ToC for a capacity and advocacy initiative for
residents to impact on public health policy and training
of public health professionals [16].
ToC differs from other theory-driven approaches to
evaluation despite similar origins. For example, al-
though logic models outline the inputs, processes,
outputs and outcomes of a programme in a similar
manner to ToC, they can be rigid and do not make ex-
plicit the causal pathways through which change hap-
pens in the way that ToC does [3]. Similarly, although
logframes were initially developed to summarise discus-
sions with stakeholders, funder-driven formats have
largely reduced logframes to a results-based manage-
ment tool [17]. Realist evaluation, on the other hand,comes from a perspective of scientific realism and fo-
cuses predominantly on the interaction between the
context, mechanisms and outcomes of the programme.
Usually used post hoc, evaluators seek to uncover the
underlying programme theories. These theories are
often more abstract than the theories developed
through ToC or logic models [18]. The development of
ToC has been influenced by Freirean thinking on how
to create social change by emp owering individuals [19].
Despite some fundamental differences in their theoret-
ical underpinnings, many of these approaches are used
interchangeably or together [18, 20].
ToC has been used widely in the development
sector for programme development and evaluation by fun-
ders such as the UK ’s Department for International
Development, Comic Relief, Grand Challenges Canada
and the Gates Foundation [3, 19]. However, there has
been no global systematic review to our knowledge
on the use of ToC for the design and evaluation of
public health interventions. Coryn et al. [4] conducted
a review of theory-driven evaluation more broadly.
They found 45 examples of theory-driven evaluation
in the peer-reviewed literature between 1990 and
2009. These evaluations included education, crime
and safety and transportation interventions. Roughly
half (21/45) were evaluations of health interventions
[4]. A rapid analysis of the included papers in prepar-
ation for this review indicated that only three of these
used ToC.
The lack of a systematic review means that there is
no clear idea of how the ToC has been used and re-
ported in the peer-reviewed and grey literature in rela-
tion to public health interventions. Given the increasing
popularity of the ToC approach, understanding how it is
has been used and described previously allows future
users of the approach to learn from the work of others
and build upon it. It also helps to move towards a more
consistent way of using the ToC approach.
In this review, we sought to review both peer-reviewed
and grey literature to determine how ToCs have been
developed and used in the development and evaluation
of public health interventions globally. Specifically, we
sought to answer the following questions:
(1)How are ToCs for public health interventions
developed and refined?
(2)How is the ToC approach used in the
(a) development of an intervention;
(b) implementation of the intervention;
(c) development of indicators for measurement;
(d) evaluation of the intervention, including
statistical approaches; and
(e) conceptualisation/evaluation of the influence of
context.Breuer et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:63 Page 2 of 17
Methods
The authors developed a protocol for this review which
was agreed prior to the commencement of the study.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1.
In summary, we included studies of public health in-
terventions which were defined as interventions which
are intended to protect health or prevent or treat ill
health in communities or populations [21]. We
included papers describing interventions addressing
any health issue in all populations which (a) described
how a ToC approach was used to design, implement
or evaluate a public health intervention or (b)
described the development of a ToC for a public
health intervention. Evaluation study designs included
longitudinal studies, quantitative surveys, case study
research [22] and qualitative studies.
We required papers to specifically mention that
they used “theory of change ”and excluded those who
did not for the following reasons. Firstly, as described
above, there are a range of overlapping definitions for
ToC and other programme evaluation methods. Given
the often minimal amount of detail provided about
the programme theory in papers, and especially in ab-
stracts, it would be difficult to enforce a standard criteria
for ToC against which papers could be evaluated for in-
clusion. Secondly, piloting the initial broad search strategy
(including all synonyms for ToC and programme logic)
returned more than 20,000 hits in only three databases. By
refining the criteria to specify ToC by name, we were able
to thoroughly explore literature which explicitly self-
identified using ToC.As the focus of this review was on public health inter-
ventions, we excluded papers in which the long-term
outcome of the ToC was a change within an individual
rather than change in the population. For example, a
ToC describing how cognitive behavioural therapy may
impact on an individual ’s cognitive processes and behav-
iour would be a change within the individual. However,
if the focus of the ToC was on how a cognitive behav-
ioural therapy intervention impacted the prevalence of
depression would be change in the population. We ex-
cluded reviews and methodological or advocacy papers
unless they included an example of how a ToC was de-
veloped or how ToC was used in the design, evaluation
and/or implementation of a public health intervention.
We did not limit the inclusion by date, language, study
design or type of publication.
Search strategy
The database searches were conducted between the 16th
November and the 4th December 2013 by EB. The main
search term used was “theory of change ”. Where the
database allowed, we limited this to health or healthcare
and to humans. We searched databases of peer-reviewed
journal articles (Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, Science
Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, Academic
Search Premier, Africa-Wide Information, CINAHL and
BIOSIS). An example of a search string used for
PyschInfo was “theory of change ”AND ( “health ”OR
“healthcare ”OR “health services ”OR “medicine ”). We
also searched grey literature databases (The Directory of
Published Proceedings OpenGrey, Disability Archive
UK, Eldis, Popline, DFID Research for Development,
SciDevNet and World Bank Documents and Reports)
and the first 50 pages of a Google search. The websites
of Comic Relief, DFID, Grand Challenges Canada, The Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation, HIVOS, World Vision,
the Robert Wood Johnson foundation, Actknowledge and
the Theory of Change Community were also searched. In
addition, we contacted experts in the field and sent re-
quests for papers to two existing global mailing lists for
evaluators: MandENEWS and Pelican.
Screening and eligibility
Following the search of databases of peer-reviewed jour-
nal articles, the titles and abstracts of the search results
from peer-reviewed papers were exported into Endnote
[23] where duplicates and irrelevant titles were removed.
The peer-reviewed journal articles found through con-
tact with experts were added to this. The titles and ab-
stracts were double screened by EB and LL against the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once the abstracts were
screened, the full papers or reports of the included ab-
stracts were obtained and assessed for eligibility by both
reviewers.Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Following the grey literature search as described
above, all potentially relevant results were saved into
Evernote [24]. These were double screened by both re-
viewers against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Any differences between authors ’opinions were re-
solved via discussion throughout the review process.
Data extraction and analysis
The data from the papers were extracted by the first au-
thor (EB) onto a data extraction form. This included in-
formation on authors, publication dates, the type of
interventions and outcomes, the development of ToC,
the use of ToC in the design, implementation and evalu-
ation of the intervention and the influence of context.
The data collection form also included key principles of
theory-driven evaluation proposed by Coryn et al. [4].
These included how the programme theory was (a) for-
mulated, (b) used to formulate and prioritise evaluation
questions, (c) plan and conduct evaluations, (d) inform
the measurement of constructs in the programme theory
and (e) provide a causal explanation. Where a paper de-
scribed or showed a ToC, we assessed what elements of
ToC they presented. The list of ToC elements was
adapted from Vogel and included context, long-term
change, process/sequence of change and assumptions
[8]. However, as there is no agreed upon assessment of
quality for papers reporting ToC, we did not asses the
quality of the included papers. We did not contact au-
thors for additional information.
Descriptive statistics were calculated using STATA 13
[25]. The papers were compared, evaluated and sum-
marised narratively in relation to review questions. Due
to the heterogeneity of the study designs, interventions
and outcomes included in this review, a meta-analysis
was not conducted.
Results
Search results
In total, 566 abstracts were screened, resulting in 200
full text peer-reviewed articles which were assessed for
eligibility. An additional 65 records were identified from
the grey literature search and screened for eligibility. A
total of 62 papers were included [1, 12 –14, 16, 26 –82].
Figure 1 is adapted from the PRISMA guidelines [83]
and summarises the search process and results.
Included studies
The publication dates of the papers range between 1999
and 2013, with a steady increase in papers over time
(Fig. 2). The majority were published in English in peer-
reviewed journals, but we also included PhD theses, pre-
sentations and NGO reports from the grey literature.
Most of the research was conducted in the USA or the
UK. More details are provided in Table 2. Four pairs ofpapers are reported on the same public health interven-
tions [1, 13, 42, 43, 54, 60, 81, 82]. However, as the pri-
mary interest of this paper is how the use of ToC is
described in reports and peer-reviewed journal articles,
we have included them as separate papers.
A variety of types of public health interventions re-
ported using ToC in the design, development and evalu-
ation of public health interventions (Table 3). These
included systems of care for adolescents with behav-
ioural and emotional difficulties [12, 26, 50, 53, 54, 56,
61, 65, 80 –82], substance use interventions [27, 49], do-
mestic violence interventions [29], comprehensive com-
munity initiatives [13, 16, 35, 62, 81], medication supply
among community health workers [40] and integrated
district level mental healthcare plans in low- and
middle-income countries [55].
Development of ToCs
Forty-nine papers (79 %) incl uded some information on the
ToC development process. Forty-three percent ( n=2 7 ) o f
the papers developed their ToCs prospectively and 19.4 %
(n= 12) retrospectively. The remainder either developed
their ToC during project replanning ( n= 3.5 %) or did not
specify when they developed their ToC ( n= 20, 32 %).
The ToCs were developed using workshops [28, 34,
47, 48, 55, 63, 64, 72, 76] and working groups [12, 53,
54, 61, 68, 69, 82], document reviews [16, 35, 44, 56, 67,
71], interviews and discussions [16, 27, 29, 35, 40, 44, 47,
56, 57, 62, 65, 66, 73, 80], surveys [31, 67], programme
observation [16, 44, 45, 56, 67], literature reviews [33,
40, 68, 69, 80] and existing conceptual frameworks or
theory [33, 40, 42 –44, 51, 64, 68, 69]. The ToC develop-
ment included consultations or interviews with the fol-
lowing stakeholders: programme staff [27, 38, 40, 44, 45,
52, 54, 57, 63, 65 –67, 72, 73, 82], management [12, 57,
61, 66, 70, 77, 82], families [12, 26, 54, 65, 77, 82], ser-
vice users [39, 47, 50, 61, 65], experts [40, 64] and evalu-
ators [13, 14, 38, 44, 52, 58, 61, 70, 75, 77, 81]. Many
used multiple methods, for example, Mookheriji and
Lafond used immunisation programme theory and dis-
cussion with programme stakeholders, including im-
munisation experts, to develop a ToC of routine
immunisation performance [64]. They used a case study
approach to evaluate immunisation performance and
then refined the ToC based on the results of this evalu-
ation and a stakeholder workshop.
The resultant ToCs were described using narrative
summaries ( n= 15, 34.1 %), diagrams ( n= 22, 50 %) or
both ( n= 6, 13.6 %). In one case, a table was used.
Table 4 outlines the components of the ToCs that were
described. Almost all of the ToCs outlined the long-term
outcome required, and the majority described the
process or sequence of change. However, assumptions
and indicators were displayed or described infrequently.Breuer et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:63 Page 4 of 17

Using ToCs to design public health interventions
Eighteen papers (29 %) described the use of ToC in the
development of a public health intervention. The major-
ity of these reported that they used the ToC as a frame-
work for the intervention [12, 31, 42, 43, 70] or as a
basis for a strategic plan [61, 68, 69, 76, 82]. Some exam-
ples of how ToCs were used to design public health in-
terventions follow. Basson et al. used formative research
to develop a ToC for a workplace wellness intervention
for HIV-affected nurses and presented this programme
theory as a framework for future research. Lund et al.
used stakeholder workshops to develop their ToC and
then used this to refine the substance and delivery of in-
tegrated district mental healthcare plans in five low- and
middle-income countries [55]. A few presentations and
papers reporting the development of systems of care for
children with behavioural difficulties used the ToC as an
outline of their public health intervention and as a basis
for their strategic plan [12, 61, 65]. Chandani et al. [40]
used the ToC to frame the results of their formative
work and used the ToC to identify interventions to ad-
dress the bottlenecks to the availability of essential medi-
cines among community health workers in Ethiopia,
Malawi and Rwanda.Using ToCs to evaluate public health interventions
Forty-nine papers (79 %) describe the use of ToC in the
evaluation of the intervention. This includes the devel-
opment of indicators, the overall evaluation design and
data analysis.
The development of indicators used in the ToC was
described in 28 papers. The indicators were often devel-
oped from the short-, medium- or long-term outcomes
described in the ToC [27, 35, 38, 58, 65, 74, 81, 84].
Thirty-two (51.6 %) measured process constructs, 28
(45.2 %) measured outcome constructs and 9 (14.5 %)
measured contextual constructs described in the ToC.
Only two papers [12, 82] explicitly described the use of
ToC to identify indicators for ongoing monitoring of the
implementation of the intervention.
The majority of papers (62.9 %) reported formulating
their evaluation questions around the ToC. However, the
papers varied in the amount of detail they provided on
this process. A common description was that the ToC
was used to provide a framework for the evaluation
[27, 32, 33, 48, 64, 72, 74, 78, 79, 81, 82]. Others re-
ported that they used the evaluation to develop [39],
refine [40] or validate the ToC [64]. Two papers re-
ported that their evaluation was guided by testing the
assumptions in the ToC [29, 34].
The data collection and analysis methods used varied
greatly across papers. Data collected for the evaluation
included routinely collected data [33, 44], custom-
designed surveys [13, 16, 32, 72, 76, 79] and qualitative
data. Qualitative data collection methods included
interviews [13, 27, 35, 47, 71, 73, 75, 79], programme
observation [13, 27, 35], programme documentation
[13, 35, 71, 75, 79] and visual evidence [32]. The
quantitative data analysis methods were strongly linked to
the types of data collected and included descriptive statis-
tics [33], inferential statistics [27, 40, 42, 43, 74, 78], multi-
level modelling [16] and path analysis [41]. Other
methods included case study approaches [16, 33, 36, 64]
and iterative thematic analysis [71] whereas others
did not explicitly state their specific data analysis ap-
proach [14, 77].
Few papers explicitly explored the influence of context
of the intervention in relation to ToC. Although some
ToCs mentioned context, particularly those with a realist
evaluation focus, there was little description of how con-
text affected the interpretation of the evaluation. There
were some exceptions [40, 56, 64, 72]. Mookherji and
LaFond used a case study approach to explore what
worked within and between immunisation programme
contexts to identify common factors influencing immun-
isation performance in Ghana, Ethiopia and Cameroon
[64]. For example, political and social commitment to
routine immunisation was seen as a key factor in
influencing immunisation performance although it wasTable 2 Basic descriptive statistics of included papers

described slightly differently for each context. Similarly,
Chandani et al. developed a cross-country ToC of com-
munity health worker supplied medication in Ethiopia,
Malawi and Rwanda. They compared whether each of
the preconditions and the outcome was achieved in each
setting [40]. These differences were then explained based
on the contextual factors in each setting such as types of
medication provided by the health workers, standard op-
erating procedures and data availability and means of
transport and travel times. Secker et al. [72] explored
the influence of socioeconomic and demographic char-
acteristics as well as infrastructure and organisational
processes and systems between eight pilot sites in the
evaluation of a preretirement health initiative.
Using ToC to provide causal explanations
Few papers reported on the identification of breakdowns
and side effects, effectiveness or efficacy and causal ex-
planation as described by Coryn et al. [4]. Only four
(6.5 %) identified breakdowns of programme theory,
three (4.8 %) identified unexpected consequences of the
intervention, ten (16.1 %) made cause-and-effect associa-
tions between theoretical constructs explicit, two (3.2 %)
described differences in direction and/or strength of re-
lationship between programme and outcomes and two
(3.2 %) described the extent to which one construct
accounted for/mediated the relationship between other
constructs.
Discussion
In this systematic review, we provide an overview of
how ToCs have been developed and used to develop and
evaluate public health interventions. As expected, there
is variation in how ToCs are developed and used inevaluation although the papers report very little detail
about the ToC process.
We have shown that the ToC approach has been in
use since at least 1999 with 62 papers found in peer-
reviewed journals and grey literature. This was signifi-
cantly more than expected, given that Coryn et al. [4]
found only three papers describing theory-driven
evaluation of health interventions using ToC. How-
ever, Coryn et al. only included papers that reported
the use of ToC for evaluation (rather than also de-
scribing the development of ToC or the use in the
design of an intervention ) and excluded those that
did not provide enough detail [4].
In this review, many papers provided little detail in re-
lation to the process of ToC development and how the
ToC was used to design the intervention or conduct the
evaluation. For example, Bonner [36] describes the ToC
approach in detail but provides only a short example of
the Health Action Zones experience of using ToC to
evaluate an intervention to reduce drug taking. Brown et
al. [37] reports using a ToC approach to evaluate a
health promotion intervention for adolescents. The only
description of ToC was found in the abstract and then
mentioned briefly in the discussion. There was no clarity
on how the ToC was developed or any explicit mention
of how it was used to inform the analysis.
In contrast, other papers provided extensive detail on
the ToC development process. For example, Hernandez
and Hodges [12] describe the 12 step process used to de-
velop a ToC for interagency delivery of mental health
services for children with serious emotional disturbances
and their families. They describe each step in detail in-
cluding the purpose of the stage of the process, the types
of stakeholders participating in the step, the substance
of the discussions and the decisions reached. The ToC
was then displayed as a logic model for readers to gain a
better understanding of the output of the process. Simi-
larly, Mookherji and LaFond [64] described in detail
their approach to developing their initial ToC and how
the ToC was used to determine case selection for a com-
parative case study. They then described how they used
the results of the comparative case study and the ToC
workshops to refine their ToC.
A range of methods were used to develop ToCs. The
methods ranged from participatory methods which en-
courage stakeholder participation and ownership of the
ToC such as workshops and working groups, to more
evaluator focused approaches such as programme obser-
vation and review of programme documentation. Al-
though the reason for the choice of methods was rarely
made explicit by the authors, these methods were pre-
sumably chosen based on the purpose, depth and level
of stakeholder buy-in the ToC required. For example,

children and adolescents with mental and behavioural
disorders viewed stakeholder participation as very im-
portant and therefore held a series of workshops with
multiple stakeholders from different government de-
partments, service providers, families and service
users [12, 50, 61]. In some cases, although stake-
holders were interviewed or participated in surveys,
they did not contribute explicitly to the development
of the ToC [16, 57]. Sullivan and Stewart [10] argue
that although participation of all stakeholders in the
development of ToC is the ideal presented by Weiss
and colleagues [7], this is not always practical or feas-
ible. They argue that different types of ToC develop-
ment and resulting ownership may have advantages
and therefore it is important to be explicit about the
development process.
The lack of detail in most of the examples in this re-
view makes it difficult to assess the thoroughness of
ToC development. In many cases, the ToC seems to
have been developed superficially and then used in a
cursory way during evaluation. Similarly, where diagrams
or narrative summaries of ToCs are presented in the pa-
pers, very little detail is included. Most authors present
the long-term outcomes, sequence of change, beneficiar-
ies and context. However, very few make their assump-
tions explicit although Vogel identifies these as a core
part of ToC [8]. Where ToC was used to develop the in-
terventions, it was often not clear how this was done
apart from providing an overarching framework or stra-
tegic plan for the intervention.
A surprising finding of the review was the paucity of
papers that describe the use of ToC for use during the
implementation of the intervention ( n= 2). Given the
popularity of ToC as a monitoring and evaluation tool
by international development agencies such as the De-
partment for International Development, UK, [8], we
had expected that more papers would use ToC during
the implementation phase to assess progress towards the
outcomes as well as modify implementation where
necessary.
ToC theorists such as Connell and Kubisch [15]
emphasise that the ToC approach to evaluation is
method neutral and, as such, does not prescribe a
specific type of study design or evaluation method.
This was reflected in the papers included in this re-
view which used a variety of qualitative and quantita-
tive data collection and analysis methods. This
flexibility in methods can be an advantage if re-
searchers can design evaluations which seek to under-
stand and evaluate both the outcomes and causal
mechanisms which are made explicit in the ToC.
However, flexibility in methods may also result in
evaluations being poorly formulated in terms of the
appropriateness of the methods, the rigor of dataanalysis or the results not interpreted in light of the
ToC. In this review, evaluations were often described
in detail but it was not clear how they linked to the
ToC or how the ToC was used to interpret the re-
sults. However, some authors clearly develop or refine
their ToCs as the results of the evaluation emerge.
For example, Carroll et al. [39] sought to describe a
theory of change for health promotion activities for
hard to reach groups which was developed through
the evaluation.
Most papers failed to explicitly discuss the results of
the ToC in relation to unexpected outcomes, direction
of causation and mediation of effects. This is similar to
the conclusions drawn by Coryn et al. who report that
programme theory was not used in any meaningful way
to develop evaluation questions or plan and conduct and
interpret the analysis [4].
It is interesting to note that no studies used ToC
alongside RCTs as a method to unpack the programme
theory underpinning the intervention. As we have noted
previously, ToC holds much potential for this as RCTs
alone are no longer considered adequate for the evalu-
ation of complex health interventions [3].
Detailed reporting of the ToC process is particularly
important as definitions of ToC differ considerably [8].
Many papers did not define ToC. However, there were
clear overlaps with other theory-driven evaluation ap-
proaches, in particular, realist approaches [32, 36, 38, 56]
and logic models [12, 26, 31, 52, 54, 61, 65, 66, 68, 69,
76, 82]. Realist approaches have a different theoretical
basis to ToC and differ in several ways including how
they articulate and generate theory, the degree to which
stakeholders are involved and the types of knowledge
they seek to generate [20]. Marchal et al. [18], in a sys-
tematic review on realist evaluation in health systems re-
search, also noted that ToC and realist evaluation were
often used together or interchangeably. Logic models are
conceptually similar to ToC but are usually presented in
a linear form with boxes for inputs, activities, outputs
and outcomes with little explanation of the causal path-
ways linking them [3]. Reducing a ToC to a logic model
may conceal some of the explanatory power of the
causal pathways.
Two limitations to this review are the lack of
double data extraction and the inability to effectively
m e a s u r et h eq u a l i t yo ft h ei n c l u d e dp a p e r s .W ed i d
extract data on a checklist of ToC components pro-
posed by Vogel [8] and principles of theory-driven
evaluation by Coryn et al. [4], but it was difficult to
make an assessment of quality. This is primarily be-
cause there is no agreed upon quality criteria for
ToC. This is compounded by the flexibility of the
ToC approach, both in the development of ToCs and
how they can be used for evaluation. BecauseBreuer et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:63 Page 13 of 17
evaluations using ToC vary in study design and
method, existing methodological checklists are of little
use for comparative purposes.
We suggest that authors planning to report on ToC to
guide the development or evaluation of public health in-
terventions provide more detail on the ToC process to
readers. In particular, it is important to make the ToC
used explicit and this is usually easier in diagrammatic
form. Complex ToCs can be simplified in a summary
diagram with detailed ToCs provided as web appendices.
This will help the reader to understand the authors ’ex-
pected pathways of change and judge their validity. In
addition, it is imperative that authors describe in detail
how the ToC was developed and used. This is particu-
larly important as there is no single way to develop or
use a ToC. Making the process explicit helps readers
judge the credibility of the ToC and strengthen the lit-
erature in this field.
We have therefore developed a checklist based on
this review and the work of Coryn et al. [4] and
Vogel [8] which can assist with the clearer reporting
of the ToC approach. The checklist gives guidance as
to which aspects of the ToC should be made explicit
(Table 5). It covers five domains, namely the (1) def-
inition of ToC; (2) description of the ToC develop-
ment process; (3) ToC diagram; (4) process of
intervention development and (5) use of ToC in
evaluation. The checklist would benefit from expert
review and piloting in the real world. However, it
provides a starting point for authors reporting a ToC
approach. As ToC is method neutral, this checklist
could also be used together with other existing check-
l i s t ss u c ha st h eC O N S O R Ts t a t e m e n tf o rR C T s[ 8 5 ] ,
the STROBE guidelines for observational research
[86] or CReDECI2 for complex intervention develop-
ment and evaluation [87].
Conclusion
The ToC approach is widespread in the public health lit-
erature. Clear reporting of the ToC process and outputs
is important to improve to allow the readers a thorough
understanding of the work and allows them to judge the
validity of the approach. We recommend that our pro-
posed checklist is used and refined by authors reporting
the ToC approach.
