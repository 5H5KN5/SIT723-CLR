Objective :The study ’s aim was to investigate psychological, behavioral and
medical long-term outcomes of an existing self-management intervention
targeting the development of proactive coping skills (e.g. goal setting and
identifying barriers) in type 2 diabetes patients. The study aimed to replicateprior research showing the intervention ’s effectiveness, and to extend it by (a)
adding booster sessions and (b) prolonging the period of follow-up measure-
ment to capture long-term effects.
Design/outcome measures :A total of 141 type 2 diabetes patients were
included in the intervention. The intervention employed a 5-step approach to
target proactive coping skills. Psychological (e.g. proactive coping and self-
efﬁcacy) and behavioural variables (e.g. self-care, diet and physical activity)
were assessed at baseline (T1), after the initial phase of the intervention (T2),after the booster phase (T3) and at follow-up (T4), comprising a total period
of 15 months. Medical variables were assessed at T1 and T4.
Results :Employing piecewise Latent Growth Curve Modelling, results
showed that participants improved on all psychological and behavioural vari-
ables during the initial phase and maintained these improvements over
12 months. The booster phase yielded no further improvements. Mixed ﬁnd-
ings were obtained on medical outcomes.
Conclusion :The original intervention is effective, but the added value of the
booster sessions is uncertain.

Type 2 diabetes is a serious chronic condition with a rapidly rising prevalence over the
last decades. When not cautiously regulated, diabetes can lead to severe macro- andmicro-vascular complications such as cardiovascular disease, blindness and foot pathol-ogy. To control their disease, patients are often advised to incorporate self-care behav-iours involving regular checking of blood glucose levels, dietary adjustments andphysical activity. Research has shown that, though generally highly motivated, many

patients do not succeed in maintaining their daily routines (e.g. Wing et al., 2001 ).
In that light, interventions that facilitate successful maintenance of behaviour changeare crucial to diabetes patients ’health. In the current paper, we investigate the long-term
effectiveness of a prolonged self-management intervention targeting the development of
proactive coping skills (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1997 ).
The current theory-based intervention (Beyond Good Intentions) was initially
developed by Thoolen, de Ridder, Bensing, and Rutten ( 2008 ) and focuses on the devel-
opment of proactive coping skills, or ‘the ability to undertake efforts in advance of a
potentially stressful event to prevent it or modify its form before it occurs ’(Aspinwall &
Taylor, 1997 ). The intervention is rooted in a framework of self-regulation and proactive
coping theories and emphasises an anticipatory planning and problem solving perspec-tive. Rather than being educated about the ‘right’behaviour, patients are taught by
means of a comprehensive 5-step plan how to (1) set small, concrete goals;
(2) identify conditions and potential barriers for goal attainment; (3) come up withproblem-solving strategies to deal with obstacles; (4) formulate speci ﬁc action plans and
(5) evaluate their progress. The intervention was previously tested in a sample of screen-detected type 2 diabetes patients and yielded signi ﬁcant improvements on psychological,
behavioural, as well as medical outcome variables (Thoolen, de Ridder, Bensing, Gorter,& Rutten, 2009 ; Thoolen et al., 2007 ) that lasted for a period of 9 months. Moreover,
participants ’evaluations of the intervention were very positive, with an average rating of
8.0 (on a 10-point scale) and 85% indicating they would recommend the programme to
someone else (Thoolen et al., 2008 ).
The current study aimed to replicate and extend the work by Thoolen and
colleagues in three ways. First, the intervention was tested in a broader sample of type2 diabetes patients. Rather than including only screen-detected patients, the currentsample consisted of patients who were recruited through general practitioners and whoreceived their diagnosis in the past 5 years. This broader sample may differ from ascreen-detected sample on several aspects. For example, screen-detected patients ’
motivation to change their behaviour may be boosted by the shock of receiving an
unexpected diagnosis (e.g. Beeney, Bakry, & Dunn, 1996 ). In contrast, ‘established ’
patients ’motivation might lack a sense of urgency as they feel they have already
adjusted to their condition. Thus, the ﬁrst aim was to establish the effectiveness of the
self-management intervention in a broader and potentially more challenging sample oftype 2 diabetes patients. As the intervention ’s effectiveness relative to a control group
was already established by Thoolen et al. ( 2007 ,2009 ), we provided the initial phase of
the intervention to all participants in the study. Second, we aimed to examine the long-
term effects of the intervention, thereby addressing the problem of behaviour change
maintenance. To that end, we prolonged the follow-up period to 12 months after theend of the intervention (i.e. 15 months in total).
The third and more prominent extension of the current study with regard to previous
work involves the addition of booster sessions. Though self-management interventions(particularly group-based programmes, Deakin, McShane, Cade, & Williams, 2005 )i n
general appear to be rather successful in terms of resulting in behavioral change (Norris,Engelgau, & Venkat Narayan, 2001 ), often the initial positive outcomes cannot be
maintained (Rothman, 2000 ; Wing et al., 2001 ). Recognising that the maintenance of
(health) behaviour change is one of the classic challenges in intervention research,scholars as well as policy makers now often recommend adding boosters to2 F.M. Kroese et al.

interventions (e.g. Brown, Garcia, Kouzekanani, & Hanis, 2002 ; Goodall & Halford,
1991 ; Newman, Steed, & Mulligan, 2004 ; Norris, Lau, Smith, Schmid, & Engelgau,
2002 ). Even though participants in the Beyond Good Intentions programme were able
to maintain their initial changes, they did not show further improvement after the inter-
vention, and Thoolen et al. ( 2008 ) reported that participants themselves indicated they
would have liked to receive booster sessions. Following up on this suggestion, the cur-rent study employed a prolonged intervention that included booster sessions at 1, 3 and6 months after the end of the initial phase. Speci ﬁcally, we investigated the differential
effects of two different booster conditions that will be referred to as the ‘how’or‘why’
boosters. The ‘how’booster sessions were included as a control condition and entailed
reinforcement of the protocol (i.e. the 5-step plan) that participants used in the initialphase, whereas the ‘why’booster sessions provided participants with an additional self-
regulatory technique to facilitate goal attainment. Speci ﬁcally, in the ‘why’boosters,
participants elaborated on their self-management goals in view of their higher-orderoverarching goals (e.g. ‘Why are you trying to get more exercise ’; cf. Freitas,
Gollwitzer, & Trope, 2004 ) before continuing with the usual 5-step programme.
Although activating positive outcomes of changing behaviour before moving on toidentifying and addressing barriers (as is done in the 5-step programme) is a promisingtechnique to bolster commitment to personal goals (Fishbach, Shah, & Kruglanski,2004 ; Oettingen, Pak, & Schnetter, 2001 ), to the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst
to apply it in an intervention.
Initial analyses (Kroese, Adriaanse, & de Ridder, 2012 ) showed that participants
evaluated the booster phase as less positive than the initial phase, and more strikingly,oneﬁfth of initial completers did not attend any of the booster sessions. Although these
analyses indicated that the booster sessions did not yield any further bene ﬁts on behav-
ioural outcome measures based on assessments immediately prior and after the boosterphase, baseline and follow-up (i.e. 6 months after the booster phase) measures are yetto be investigated. In the present paper, we provide such a complete overview of the
trajectories of change during the intervention ’s different phases, including psychological,
behavioural as well as medical measures and employing more advanced data analysistechniques, as described below.
In addition to the theoretical advances, the current study departs from traditional
statistical techniques to be able to fully appreciate the development of patients ’
self-management skills and behaviour throughout the course of the intervention. Ratherthan comparing mean baseline and end-scores, we tested individual trajectories ofchange in three phases of the intervention (i.e. initial phase, booster phase, follow-up).
The current study is one of the ﬁrst in the area of health psychology to employ piece-
wise latent growth curve modelling (piecewise LGCM; e.g. Duncan & Duncan, 2004 ;
Li, Duncan, Duncan, & Hops, 2001 ). Rather than treating individual differences as error
variances, LGCM takes individual trajectories into account, thereby yielding a morereliable re ﬂection of change over time. Additionally, the piecewise approach allows for
speciﬁc interpretations of patients ’development through each phase of the intervention,
thus suiting our research aims.
In sum, the current paper aims to establish insight into the development of self-
management skills during the initial phase, a newly developed booster phase and an
extended follow up period, comprising 15 months in total. We contribute to theliterature in several important ways, including (a) the replication of an effectivePsychology & Health 3

intervention in a different sample of diabetes patients, (b) the addition of booster
sessions and (c) the use of advanced statistical techniques that allow reliable and preciseestimation of intervention effects.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited through general practitioners. A total of 160 patients partici-
pated in the study, of whom 129 returned baseline (T1) questionnaires. Participants whodid not complete baseline questionnaires but who did return at least two questionnaires
at later assessment points were retained in the analyses, although it is noted that no
demographics (which were assessed at baseline) are available of this group ( N= 13).
Participants who completed only the baseline questionnaire were included in the analy-ses, but participants who completed only one questionnaire which was not the baseline(N= 4) were left out. Fourteen participants returned none of the questionnaires. These
together with data from one participant who reported to have failed to attend any of thegroup sessions were also disregarded in the analyses. Hence, the current sample con-sisted of 141 participants of whom 128 provided data at baseline, 98 at T2 (after the
initial phase), 80 at T3 (after the booster phase) and 93 at T4 (follow-up). Furthermore,
medical measures were obtained at T1 ( N= 116) and T4 ( N= 81).
Sex was distributed evenly with 52.3% male participants, and on average, partici-
pants were 60.4 years of age (SD = 8.6; range 39 –74). Over one-third of the sample
(37.5 %) had completed no or only lower education (i.e. lower vocational education orless), 38.3% completed medium-level education (high school or medium-level voca-tional education), and 24.2% were highly educated (college/university degree). A major-ity of 94.5% was born in the Netherlands. With regard to the medical background, the
average Body Mass Index (BMI) was 31.2 kg/m
2(SD = 5.7), and the mean level of
Hba1c at baseline was 49.1 mmol/l (SD = 8.3), re ﬂecting plasma glucose levels that
indicate diabetes (WHO, 2011 ).
Procedure
The initial phase (3 months) of the intervention comprised one individual and four
group sessions (6 –8 participants) that took place once every two weeks and were lead
by instructed trainers. The booster phase (6 months) consisted of three group sessions
at 1, 3 and 6 months after the end of the initial phase. Prior to the booster phase, par-ticipants were randomly assigned to ‘how’and‘why’groups. A description of the
Beyond Good Intentions programme as well as the booster sessions is provided below.The protocol for each group session was standardised and written out in a trainer ’s
manual. Prior to the start of the intervention two meetings with trainers were organisedin which trainers received detailed information about the ﬁve-step plan and session pro-
cedures. It was explicitly stated that trainers should adhere to the protocol, and a
researcher was present least one group session per trainer to ensure such adherence.
Baseline assessments of behavioural and psychological measures as well as demograph-ics were taken at T1, prior to the ﬁrst group session. Behavioural and psychological
measures were assessed again after the initial phase of the intervention (i.e. 3 monthsafter baseline; T2), after the booster phase (i.e. 9 months after baseline; T3), and at4 F.M. Kroese et al.

follow-up (i.e. 15 months after baseline; T4). The study was approved by the Medical
Ethical Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, and all participants signedinformed consents.
Beyond good intentions
The Beyond Good Intentions programme (Thoolen et al., 2008 ) is a proactive coping-
based self-management intervention. The programme revolves around a comprehensive5-step approach that teaches patients to (1) set small, attainable goals; (2) recogniseconditions and barriers for goal achievement; (3) ﬁnd problem solving strategies for
speciﬁc challenging situations; (4) formulate action plans and (5) evaluate progress.
Each of the four group sessions focused on one theme relevant for successful diabetes
care: eating behaviour, physical activity, medical regimes and a topic of patients ’own
choice (related to one of the previous three domains). In between group sessions,patients were provided with homework assignments related to the 5-step approach (e.g.keeping track of goal progress using food or exercise diaries).
Booster phase
In the booster phase, three group sessions were added to the original intervention. Par-
ticipants were split into two conditions, which entailed reinforcement of the focus on
small, attainable goals (i.e. a control condition repeating the protocol from the initialphase, referred to as the ‘how’-condition), that was augmented with an additional tech-
nique that challenged patients to focus on their higher order goals in the ‘why’condi-
tion. To illustrate, in the why-condition participants were asked to elaborate on one oftheir personal goals by repeatedly answering why-questions. For example, a goal couldbe to ‘exercise twice a week ’, and participants would consecutively elaborate on why
they want to exercise twice a week (e.g. ‘to stay ﬁt’), why they want to stay ﬁt (e.g. ‘to
be able to do things with my grandchildren ’), and why they want to be able to do
things with their grandchildren (e.g. ‘it makes me happy ’; cf. Freitas et al., 2004 ). In
the how-condition, participants followed the ﬁve-step approach as described above,
which focused on detailed plans on how a goal would be achieved.
Measures
Psychological measures
Proactive coping
Proactive coping skills were measured with the Utrecht Proactive Coping Competences
questionnaire (Bode, Thoolen, & de Ridder, 2008 ), which consists of 21 items (e.g. ‘I
am capable of coming up with alternatives when a solution doesnot work ’; Cronbach ’s
α= .93 at T1) that could be answered on a scale from 1 ( not at all )t o4( very capable ).
Self-ef ﬁcacy
To assess self-ef ﬁcacy, an adapted version of a questionnaire developed by Lorig et al.
(1989 ) was used (cf. Thoolen et al., 2009 ). The scale consisted of 12 items andPsychology & Health 5
Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 08:31 28 October 2013 

assessed self-ef ﬁcacy in performing a range of speci ﬁc self-care behaviours (Cronbach ’s
α= .84 at T1). Each item was phrased as ‘How con ﬁdent are you that you can …
[e.g. adhere to your doctor ’s dietary advice] ’and could be answered on a scale from 1
(not at all con ﬁdent)t o7( totally con ﬁdent).
Behavioural measures
Diabetes self-careDiabetes self-care behaviour was assessed with the revised summary of the Diabetes
Self-Care Activities measure (DSCA; Toobert, Hampson, & Glasgow, 2000 ). The scale
consists of 10 items assessing diet, exercise, bloodglucose testing, and footcare
(Cronbach ’sα= .65 at T1). Participants were asked to indicate for each domain ‘Over
the last 7 days, how often did you …’resulting in a mean score of 0 –7.
Medication adherence
The Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS; Horne & Weinman, 1999 ) was used
to assess the degree to which patients take their medication as prescribed (i.e. changing
doses, stopping or forgetting to take medication). The scale consists of 5 items with
scores ranging from 1 ( always true )t o5( never true ), with higher scores indicating bet-
ter adherence (Cronbach ’sα= .83 at T1). The questionnaire is widely used in interven-
tion studies among patients with chronic diseases and was also employed in priorresearch testing the Beyond Good Intentions intervention (Thoolen et al., 2009 ).
Lifestyle adherence
An adaptation of the MARS (Theunissen, de Ridder, Bensing, & Rutten, 2003 ) was
included to assess adherence to lifestyle recommendations (e.g. ‘I forget to adhere to the
lifestyle guidelines provided by my general practitioner ’). The scale consists of 5 items
with scores ranging from 1 ( always true )t o5( never true ), such that higher scores indi-
cate better adherence (Cronbach ’sα= .92 at T1).
Physical activity
Physical activity was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (Schuit,
Schouten, Westerterp, & Saris, 1997 ), which incorporates not only exercise but also
occupational, leisure and household activities. The scale consists of 15 items and thetime spent on each activity is translated into a composite score between 0 and 800reﬂecting the total energy expenditure. It is noted that the measure is not restricted to
elderly people, but more generally offers an assessment of a wide range of activities,including lighter activity domains that tend to be neglected in typical physical activitymeasures. As such, the scale is useful for getting a more complete and accurate view
on physical activity and particularly appropriate to use in patients with chronic diseases.6 F.M. Kroese et al.

Dietary habits
To assess dietary habits, the Kristal food habits questionnaire (Kristal, Shattuck, &
Henry, 1990 ) was used. The 20-item scale assesses how often patients employ speci ﬁc
activities to reduce fat intake, including, for example, the replacement of high-fat foodsand modifying meat preparation (e.g. ‘When you eat chicken, how often has it been
fried’; Cronbach ’sα= .67 at T1).
Medical outcomes
A number of medical variables were assessed by registered nurses at baseline (T1) and
at follow-up (T4). From blood measures, Hba1c, triglyceride and cholesterol (HDL and
LDL) were determined. Hba1c reﬂects average blood sugar levels over the past 6 weeks
and is an important indicator of diabetes control.
1Normal values should be below
48 mmol/mol. Triglycerides , together with cholesterol, are indicative of fat storage in
the body and are often elevated in diabetes patients (American Diabetes Association,2012 ). Typically, guidelines recommend to keep triglyceride levels below 1.7 mmol/l.
HDL , then, is known as the ‘good cholesterol ’and should be higher than 1.0 mmol/l,
whereas LDL is the ‘bad cholesterol ’which is recommended to be kept below
2.6 mmol/l (American Diabetes Association, 2012 ). Finally, blood pressure was mea-
sured, and BMI was computed by measuring patients ’weight and height
(BMI = weight/height
2).
Analyses
Psychological and behavioural outcomes variables were analysed using piecewise
LGCM. Importantly, rather than testing mean changes over time such as done by tradi-
tional techniques (e.g. repeated measures MANOVA), LGCM allows for the analysis of
individual trajectories of change. Being relieved of a number of limitations that tradi-tional statistical techniques are facing (e.g. Curran & Muthen, 1999 ), LGCM has greater
power to ﬁnd intervention effects. For example, for a repeated measures MANOVA, the
assumption is made that all covariances are equal, which is unlikely when the time inter-vals between different data points vary. Moreover, an important advantage of LGCMover the ‘traditional ’analyses of variance is that, rather than suffering from a loss of data
points due to listwise deletion procedures which is a problem especially when analysing
interventions with high drop-out rates, LGCM allows for all available data to be incorpo-
rated in the model. For the current study, we applied piecewise LGCM in MPlus(Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2010 ) to analyse the trajectories of change during the three
phases of the intervention: the initial phase, the booster phase and the follow-up period.Hence, the intercept refers to the overall starting point before the intervention, the ﬁrst
slope parameter refers to the initial phase (denoted by β
1), the second slope parameter
refers to the booster phase (denoted by β2) and the third slope parameter refers to the
follow-up phase (denoted by β3). As participants were assigned to the how- and
why-conditions only in the booster phase, the intercept as well as the slope during the
initial phase were constrained to be equal for the two conditions, whereas the other twoslopes were estimated for each condition separately.Psychology & Health 7

Because maximum likelihood with robust standard errors and chi-square (MLR)
estimators yielded negative variances, in the ﬁnal analyses Bayesian estimators were
applied (Lynch, 2007 ; Gelman, Carlin, Stern, & Rubin, 2004 ). Accordingly, signi ﬁcance
levels were determined based on central credibility intervals (C.C.I.), which are the
Bayesian equivalent of con ﬁdence intervals and re ﬂect a 90% probability that a certain
parameter lies in between two boundaries. When zero is not included in the centralcredibility interval, it can be said that the parameter (i.e. the slope) is signi ﬁcantly
different from zero. Group differences are demonstrated when the C.C.I. ’s for the two
groups do not show overlap. As an indicator of model ﬁt, we report the posterior
predictive p-value ( PPP), which is the Bayesian equivalent of classic ﬁt indices such as
TLI, CFI, or RMSEA. PPP-values around .50 indicate a well- ﬁtting model (Gelman
et al., 2004 ). In MPlus, the default settings of the Bayesian Estimator were used
with regard to prior speci ﬁcations, burn-in and convergence criteria (Muthén &
Asparouhouv, in press ).
As for the medical outcome measures, only two data points were available (T1 and
T4), only one slope was computed in MPlus. Again, the intercept was constrained to beequal for the two conditions, whereas the slope was estimated separately for thehow- and the why-condition.
Results
Primary outcomes: psychological variables
As can be seen in Table 1, for the initial phase, the data revealed signi ﬁcant positive
slopes of proactive coping ( β
1= .23) and self-ef ﬁcacy ( β1= .28). This indicates that,
overall, participants improved on these measures during this period. The slopes of thebooster phase as well as the follow-up phase did not reach signi ﬁcance, showing that
participants improved nor regressed during these periods. Correlations between proactive
coping and self-ef ﬁcacy ranged from .58 to .70 ( p’s < .001) at the different time points.

Secondary outcomes: behavioural variables
Diabetes self-care
The development of diabetes self-care revealed a positive slope during the initial phase
(β1= .87), and scores remained stable during the booster phase and follow-up (see
Table 2).
Lifestyle and medication adherence
For both lifestyle and medication adherence, a positive slope during the initial phase
was observed ( β1= .46 and β1= .34, respectively). Participants in the how-condition
showed regression during the booster phase ( β2=−.37 and β2=−.43), but this was not
found for participants in the why-condition. On medication adherence, patients in thehow-condition recovered during the follow-up phase ( β

for lifestyle adherence. For the why-condition, no signi ﬁcant slopes during the follow-
up phase were found for either measure, indicating stability. Interestingly, for both
measures, negative correlations were found between the intercepts and slopes during theTable 2. Standardised parameter estimates of growth curve predictions of behavioural outcome

1= .74 for both measures). On food habits, participants in the
why-condition regressed during the booster phase ( β2=−.57), whereas those in the
how-condition remained stable. Neither improvement nor regression was observedduring the follow-up phase. On physical activity, after the initial improvement bothconditions remained stable during booster and follow-up.
Tertiary outcomes: medical measures
The analyses revealed a signi ﬁcant increase in HDL, and a signi ﬁcant decrease in LDL,
reﬂecting a more favourable balance between ‘good’and‘bad’cholesterol levels. Fur-
thermore, participants in the why-condition showed lower systolic and diastolic bloodpressure, but this effect did not reach signi ﬁcance in the how-condition. No effect was
found on triglyceride levels or BMI. Furthermore, in the how-condition, a signi ﬁcant
rise in Hba1c levels was observed, indicating poorer glucose control (Table 3).
Importantly –although for some (psychological, behavioural, as well as medical)
outcome variables in particular phases the slope for one condition did reach signi ﬁcance
whereas the slope for the other condition did not –the credibility intervals for the how-
and why-condition had considerable overlap for all slopes (the only exception being forsystolic blood pressure). Therefore, we cannot conclude that the two conditions signi ﬁ-
cantly differed from each other in terms of their development during the intervention.
Missing data
As the current study suffered from missing data (e.g. 128 valid cases at T1, and 84
valid cases at T4), it was checked whether missing data could have biased the results.First, participants with and without missing data assessments were compared on base-

line psychological and behavioural variables, relevant demographics (sex, age and edu-
cation), and medical starting points (BMI and Hba1c assessed at baseline). No signi ﬁ-
cant differences between these groups of participants emerged ( p’s > .09 with the
exception of medical adherence, p= .054), suggesting that the statistical conclusions
are unlikely to be biased due to missing values. In addition, the LGCMs for two vari-
ables (proactive coping and diabetes self-care) were re-analysed with multiple imputeddatasets constructed with MICE software (Van Buuren, 2012 ; Van Buuren &
Groothuis-Oudskoorn, 2011 ). Running the analyses for ﬁve imputed datasets revealed
that, especially at the later time points (i.e. follow-up slopes), the variability in parame-ter estimates increased. Hence, as also re ﬂected in the credibility intervals in Tables 1
and2, it should be noted that the later slope parameters suffer from greater uncertainty,
due to the missing values. Importantly, though, although some numerical differences in
parameter estimates could be observed, the overall conclusions of our analyses did not
change: the intervention had positive effects in the initial phase, and participants tendedto remain stable during the booster phase and follow-up.
General discussion
The main aim of the current study was to investigate the development of psychological,
behavioural as well as medical variables during the course of a self-management inter-
vention targeting type 2 diabetes patients. In terms of psychological and behavioural
outcomes, during the initial phase a positive effect was found on all variables, showingthat patients on average improved on psychological (i.e. self-ef ﬁcacy, proactive coping)
as well as behavioural self-care measures. During the booster phase, patients tended toremain stable, although on some measures a slight relapse was observed. No clear dif-ferential patterns were distinguished between the how- and why booster sessions in thisregard. Finally, patients remained stable in the follow-up phase, showing neither relapsenor further improvement.
In line with previous ﬁndings (Thoolen et al., 2007 ;2009 ), results indicate that the
intervention is effective, yielding improvements during the initial phase that were gener-ally maintained for a period of more than a year. This suggests that the intervention ’s
focus on the development of proactive coping skills is a promising approach to success-ful initiation and maintenance of diabetes patients ’self-care behaviour. It should be
noted, though, that the maintenance of patients ’improvements in terms of psychological
and behavioural measures may not be necessarily due to the addition of booster ses-sions; prior research showed similar maintenance effects up to 9 months after the initial
phase without booster sessions (Thoolen et al., 2007 ). The ﬁnding that the booster ses-
sions did not yield further improvements contradicts the widespread belief that boostersessions should be implemented to render additional bene ﬁts (e.g. Newman et al., 2004 ;
Norris et al., 2002 ). Together with the fact that drop-out during the booster phase was
high and patients ’evaluations were not positive (Kroese et al., 2012 ), these ﬁndings
suggest that the added value of the booster sessions is questionable.
As we found no clear differential patterns between the how- and why-condition in
the booster phase, the current study suggests that introducing new techniques in the
booster sessions is not more favourable than continuing the regular programme. How-
ever, before dismissing the theory-based idea that focusing on the ‘why’of personalPsychology & Health 11

goals may have positive outcomes in interventions, we would recommend that this
approach receives further attention in future research.
Even though the booster sessions did not yield further improvements, the fact that
participants generally did not show regression over the course of the 12-month period
after the initial phase is, however, quite notable. While maintenance is generally
problematic in intervention studies targeting behaviour change (Newman et al., 2004 ;
Rothman, 2000 ), our results showed that improvements gained during the initial phase
remained mostly stable. Speculating on the factors that fostered the stability of the out-comes, we suggest that focusing on the development of self-regulatory skills, ratherthan providing behavioural guidelines, may have facilitated the maintenance of behav-iour change. The current intervention focused on the acquisition of proactive copingskills (i.e. goal setting, dealing with obstacles, evaluating progress) which –through
their frequent and repeated use –are likely to contribute to the development of adaptive
habits. When habits are indeed established, the wanted behaviour becomes largely auto-matic and thus requires little effort to maintain (Rothman, Sheeran, & Wood, 2009 ).
Moreover, once-learned skills provide people with the opportunity to apply the tech-niques to a wide variety of behaviours that they want to change, fostering patient auton-omy and empowerment. In line with this suggestion, the Standards of Medical Care,published yearly by the American Diabetes Association ( 2012 ), noted that the ‘current
best practice for Diabetes Self-Management Education is a skills-based approach that
focuses on helping those with diabetes making informed self-management choices ’
(page S25). Hence, the current study underscores the importance of employing theory-based interventions (see also Michie, Fixsen, Grimshaw, & Eccles, 2009 ) and teaching
skills rather than providing patients with mere behavioural guidelines.
Besides positive outcomes on psychological and behavioural measures, our study
also revealed signi ﬁcant effects on blood pressure and cholesterol at follow-up. The
improvements on cholesterol (both on lowering LDL and elevating HDL) are notewor-thy, as it has recently been suggested that lowering LDL is the primary lipid target
(American Diabetes Association, 2012 ). However, our other ﬁndings were mixed: On
triglycerides and BMI, we did not ﬁnd any improvements over the course of the inter-
vention and, in fact, patients in the how-condition showed even slightly worsenedHba1c levels at follow-up compared to baseline. The fact that we were only able toassess medical variables at baseline and at follow-up and, more importantly, that medi-cal outcomes are for a large part determined by medication, limits the interpretation ofthese ﬁndings in relation to the current intervention. However, noting that prior research
did report successful results on medical outcomes (Thoolen et al., 2009 ), we are unsure
why this was not replicated in the current study. Possible explanations may be found in
different sample characteristics or in the fact that medical variables in the current sam-ple were not that bad to begin with, implying the possibility of ceiling effects. Futureresearch is needed to further investigate the intervention ’s potential to yield improve-
ments in terms of medical outcomes.
Our study is one of the ﬁrst in the area of health psychology to employ piecewise
LGCM to evaluate the development of patients during an intervention (but see alsoVinkers, Adriaanse, Kroese & de Ridder, 2013 ). Whereas LGCM has started to ﬁnd its
way into the developmental psychology literature, papers reporting intervention studies
in health psychology seem to lag behind in this regard. An important advantage of themethod is that individual trajectories are taken into account, thereby creating larger12 F.M. Kroese et al.
Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 08:31 28 October 2013 

power to ﬁnd intervention effects. It is important to obtain the most accurate effects to
reliably assess an intervention ’s potential for implementation outside research settings,
and therefore statistical techniques that allow for such improvements are of great value.With this paper, we hope to contribute to the dissemination and stimulation of advanced
statistical methods within applied research settings.
In spite of the merits of this paper, some limitations of our study should also be
noted. First of all, our study suffered from patient dropout, which is a common problemin intervention studies (e.g. Vinkers, Adriaanse, & de Ridder, 2013 ). Next to the fact
that, despite repeated reminders, a large number of participants failed to return theirquestionnaires at each measurement point, those that were retained in the study did notnecessarily attend all group sessions (see also Kroese et al., 2012 ). Importantly, though,
we found that having missing data were not predicted by any patient characteristics,
thereby suggesting that our results are unlikely to be biased due to the dropout of
patients. It should nonetheless be noted that a re-analysis of our data using imputeddatasets showed that the presence of missing data introduced uncertainty in the resultsfor the later time points, which should accordingly be regarded with caution. On arelated note –as attendance is a prerequisite but not a guarantee for receiving the treat-
ment as planned –it is important for future research to systematically evaluate both
patients ’as well as providers ’adherence to the intervention protocol to ensure ﬁdelity
of delivery (see e.g. Hardeman et al., 2008 ).
Second, the initial phase of our study did not include a control condition. A previ-
ous randomised controlled trial of the current intervention showed that participants inthe control condition did not change on any of the variables, indicating that theimprovements found in the experimental condition were indeed due to the interventionrather than re ﬂecting mere measurement effects (Thoolen et al., 2007 ,2009 ). Hence,
based on ethical considerations, we chose to refrain from recruiting an additional groupof patients that would only be burdened with ﬁlling out questionnaires. However –
although the main purpose of the current paper was to assess patients ’development
over time during the intervention, rather than comparing start and end points –the inter-
pretation of the intervention ’s effectiveness in terms of its ﬁnal outcomes should be
considered with caution as we cannot say what the outcomes would be for a controlgroup that received no intervention.
In addition to addressing the drop-out issue, for example, by making the interven-
tion attractive to a wider audience, we foresee two other important directions for futureresearch. First, a natural question that follows from the theoretical underpinnings ofinterventions based on proactive coping skills is in what way the improvements on psy-
chological and behavioural measures are interrelated. That is, theoretically, it would be
inferred that changes are ﬁrst established on psychological factors, with behavioural
effects following as a consequence of the former. Cross-lagged models including multi-ple measurement points of each factor could provide insights into the relations betweendifferent variables and their development.
A second direction for future research would be to apply the current intervention to
different populations, especially those that may not be particularly skilled in terms ofproactive coping. For example, in the current intervention, it was found that, at
baseline, obese diabetes patients reported to have lower proactive coping skills
compared with non-obese patients. Importantly, however, both groups showed equaland signi ﬁcant improvements over the course of the intervention (Kroese, Adriaanse,Psychology & Health 13
Downloaded by [University Library Utrecht] at 08:31 28 October 2013 

& de Ridder, 2013 ). Given the promising ﬁndings thus far, it seems worthwhile to
continue the investigation of the effectiveness of self-management interventions indifferent target groups.
Altogether, notwithstanding the limitations outlined above, the current paper pro-
vides a relevant addition to the health psychology literature in two ways. First, we
showed the long-term effectiveness of a theory-based intervention focusing on proactivecoping skills in type 2 diabetes patients. Although the booster sessions did not yieldfurther improvements, the 15-month stability of our ﬁndings is notable. Second, we
applied a novel statistical technique to the analysis of the intervention effects, allowingfor more accurate interpretations of patients ’development over time. We conclude that
a focus on proactive coping skills comprises a promising approach to improving self-management behaviour among type 2 diabetes patients, which deserves continued
attention in the coming years.

1. Blood glucose levels were also assessed, but based on reports from the medical lab indicating
that not all patients had in fact abstained from eating prior to the blood withdrawals, we were
not convinced of the reliability of these data. Therefore, we only considered Hba1c levels,
which re ﬂect blood glucose levels over a period of six weeks and in that way constitute a
more accurate measure of patients ’average blood sugar control.
