Optimising the value of the evidence
generated in implementation science: the
use of ontologies to address the challenges
Susan Michie1*and Marie Johnston2
Abstract
Implementing research findings into healthcare practice and policy is a complex process occurring in diverse
contexts; it invariably depends on changing human behaviour in many parts of an intricate implementation system.
Questions asked with the aim of improving implementation are multifarious variants of ‘What works, compared
with what, how well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what setting and
why? ’. Relevant evidence is being published at a high rate, but its quantity, complexity and lack of shared
terminologies present challenges. The achievement of efficient, effective and timely synthesis of evidence is
facilitated by using ‘ontologies ’to systematically structure and organise the evidence about constructs and their
relationships, using a controlled, well-defined vocabulary.
Background
Implementing research evid ence into practice depends on
changing human behaviour —at individual, organisational,
community and population levels [1]. The pathways of
implementation are generally complex, weaving in non-
linear fashions through multi-level systems; but at every
level, practice only changes when people do things differ-
ently. People may be managers, service commissioners and
providers, ancillary, administrative and technical staff,
policy-makers, politicians amongst others.
A considerable body of evidence about behaviour
change in relation to health has accumulated, as evidenced
by systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library
(Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care
Group (EPOC) [2]). This evidence can be drawn upon to
inform implementation. Frameworks abound, with a
cross-disciplinary review identifying 83 theories [3, 4].
Many have been applied to implementation behaviours,
mainly healthcare professionals ’behaviours such as
clinical assessments and procedures, prescribing, advising
and test ordering [5]. However, despite some successes,
interventions to change behaviour have had modest and
variable success. This to some extent reflects the largeheterogeneity in interventions resulting in part from their
complexity, with many interacting components, both the
techniques themselves and their delivery features (e.g.
mode, source and dose). In addition, contexts are hetero-
geneous with huge variation in intervention setting and
target population, and context may influence the effective-
ness of interventions. Although the majority of implemen-
tation and behavioural intervention research is conducted
in the USA, the majority of global health challenges
concern settings and populations in very different
countries, cultures and contexts. A further source of
heterogeneity is the variety in study methods used in
intervention evaluations.
To make significant improvements, we want to be able to
answer with confidence, variants of the questions posed by
implementation and other researchers, policy makers and
practitioners: ‘What works, compared with what, how well,
with what exposure, with wha t behaviours (for how long),
for whom, in what setting and why? ’a n dw ew a n tt ob ea b l e
to do this for questions that often lack large amounts of
high-quality evidence. This will require very extensive
searches to identify evidence and the ability to make
inferences where evidence is lacking. Evidence of which
behaviour change interventions are effective is required by
a wide range of sciences (including implementation,
behavioural, psychological , clinical, human factors and* Correspondence: s.michie@ucl.ac.uk

Limitations of current efforts to generate and
apply evidence about behaviour change
Current efforts to systematically generate and apply the
available evidence about behaviour change are limited by
the quantity of evidence, its complexity and the lack of
standardised terminology and structures for reporting
interventions and their evaluations.
There is no shortage of publications on behaviour
change and interventions. For example, Google Scholar
searches identified over 145,000 publications for
‘behaviour change intervention ’in 2016 which reflects
the high publication rate for the last 20 years. At this
pace, only a very efficient system could aggregate the
evidence and we currently lack such a system. Our
limited search and review methods may additionally
contribute to the problem of reproducibility of results as
cognitive biases may influence our search terms and
interpretation of findings [6]. As a result, it is difficult to
ascertain what we know and where there are gaps in the
evidence base. Even where good evidence exists and is
synthesised, the resulting review and recommendations
are inevitably out of date by the time it is complete, due
to the laborious work involved [7].
The issue of quantity of evidence is exacerbated by its
complexity. An effective aggregation of evidence should
take account of the active content and delivery of the
interventions, the theoretical basis for the intervention,
the characteristics of populations and settings in
addition to specifying the target behaviours and the
methods of investigation. However, while evidence
continues to be generated at a fast pace, there is no
agreed framework for accumulating that evidence and as
a result, evidence is fragmented and gaps in the evidence
are difficult to identify.
Evidence synthesis is furth er hampered by the wide vari-
ability and quality of research methods used to evaluate the
effectiveness of interventions. Even for the same behaviour,
outcomes may be assessed in different ways, e.g. objective
versus self-report measure s, with different follow-up
periods. Even when a randomised controlled trial design is
used, interpretation of findings can depend on the support
or treatment given to the control groups.
Complexity is exacerbated when reporting of interven-
t i o n sa n ds t u d i e si si n c o m p l e t e [8], a problem that is greater
for behavioural than other non-pharmacological trials [9].
As a result, attempts to advance the science of behaviour
change are hampered and effective interventions cannot be
implemented reliably in practice. This means that there
continues to be wastage of evidence due to the inadequacy
of our terminology and structures for reporting behaviour
change and interventions.In sum, there is currently too much, incompletely
reported evidence on behaviour change interventions for
current methods to synthesise within an acceptable time
frame. In addition, the systems available for aggregation of
t h ee v i d e n c er e f l e c tac o m p l e x i t yr e q u i r i n gm o r eh u m a n
and funding resources than are available. Although these
points have been made about behaviour change interven-
tions, they apply also to implementation interventions.
The potential of ‘Ontologies ’to advance
collaborative and cumulative science
Recent advances in behavioural, computing and informa-
tion sciences provide a step change in the possibilities
for addressing complex questions efficiently, effectively
and in a timely manner. Developments in information
science include automating parts of the process such as
the evaluation of risk of bias in trials. Methods of
making synthesised evidence accessible are advancing
but depend on success in generating useful search terms
for accessing the accumulated evidence. In computer
science, developments such as natural language process-
ing, machine learning and artificial intelligence provide
new opportunities for synthesising the burgeoning and
fragmented scientific literature and making inferences
where gaps exist [10, 11]. Computing systems have
enabled more efficient identification of published reports
of interventions [12] reducing the human load and
increasing the speed of evidence synthesis. In addition,
they offer the potential to integrate the evidence more
effectively [13] and, in the long term, provide novel
insights by identifying patterns and associations not
detectable by current methods.
However, a review of automated evidence extraction
methods noted the incompleteness of methods, pointing
to the importance of having a strong framework or
‘ontology ’for organising the information that might be
extracted [14]. An ontology is a systematic structure for
organising knowledge about (1) entities (constructs)
using a controlled vocabulary for labels and definitions
and (2) their inter-relationships. They facilitate codifica-
tion of this knowledge in a computer-readable format to
enable organisation, reuse, integration and analysis [15].
In addition, the systematic organisation of knowledge by
ontologies may lead to the generation of additional
knowledge which is present but undetected in the
evidence base as computers can investigate patterns in
the evidence more rapidly and without the preconcep-
tions of humans.
Developments in behavioural science are providing
shared terminology and structures for conceptualising
behaviour change interventions providing a method for
more co-ordinated extractio n and synthesis of evidence.
Ninety-three behaviour change techniques, the active ingre-
dients of behaviour change interventions, had been definedMichie and Johnston Implementation Science  (2017) 12:131 Page 2 of 4
by 2013 [16, 17] organised hierarchically and shown to be
used reliably; and others have since been identified. Mean-
while, statistical methods of combining techniques to
explain outcomes are being advanced and initial typologies
of context have been developed in relation to interventions
[18], behaviours [19] and implementation [20]. More
recently, a hierarchical taxonomy of modes of delivery
based on more than 60 unique modes in use in published
literatures has been developed [21].
Structures for conceptualising behaviour change evalua-
tions and interventions have been developed such as
Cochrane ’s PICO ontology (specifying the population/
problem, intervention, controls and outcomes) [22], and
TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Repli-
cation) template for reporting the essential components of
interventions offers consensus methods for organising and
thus simplifying complexity [8]. The use of ontologies
goes some way to capitalise on recent developments in
order to address many of the problems raised above.
Behavioural science and implementation science could
gain enormously by drawing on computational methods
to optimise the value of current evidence. However, in
order to make these gains, we need to make our evidence
computer readable. This will require a consensus-based
system of organising our knowledge that identifies the key
‘entities ’which define our evidence and which can be reli-
ably recognised, on a limited scale, by humans. In sum, a
behaviour change intervention ontology is required to
allow accumulated evidence to be computer readable as a
basis for more rapid and effective evidence synthesis.
Implications for implementation science
If implementation science continues to depend on human
integration of evidence using heterogeneous terminologies,
we will accumulate more system atic reviews but is unlikely
to achieve the theoretical understanding about behaviour
change that is needed by implementation researchers and
practitioners, and the research, policy and practice commu-
nities more broadly.
The Human Behaviour Change Project, funded by the
Wellcome Trust from 2016 to 2020, aims to build on the
scientific developments to provide a step change in our
ability to synthesise evidence at scale, speed and granularity
[23, 24]. It will, using artific ial intelligence and machine
learning, develop and evaluate a ‘knowledge system ’that
continually scans the world literature on behaviour change
interventions, automatically extracts key information,
synthesises and interprets findings to generate new insights
about behaviour change and i mprove prediction of inter-
vention effectiveness.
The project will be collaborative throughout, generating
data that can be used by the research community to
address a wide range of research questions and involving a
large international consortium of stakeholders and scientificadvisors. The project will also build a user interface to allow
researchers to access up-to-d ate syntheses and interpreta-
tions of evidence.
We believe that ‘business as usual ’is not an option if we
are to make the step changes in evidence synthesis and in
our capacity to answer the ‘big’shared question for imple-
mentation and behavioural science: What works, compared
with what, how well, with what exposure, with what
behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what settings and
why? Ontologies offer a way forward by enabling us to
structure our knowledge to make it recognisable to com-
puters in order to gain the scale and completeness required.
Implications for research agenda
This work is in its infancy and suggests a wide range of
research questions, a few of which we set out here:
1. Are there important aspects of implementation
interventions which we cannot currently report
and which (a) would benefit from the
development of an ontology or (b) where an
ontology is likely to be impossible?
2. How acceptable and feasible are taxonomies and
ontologies to those conducting, reporting,
interpreting, synthesising and implementing evidence?
3. Do taxonomies and ontologies lead to evidence
reports which
a. Are more easily understood?
b. Are interpreted accurately, i.e. as in the original
intervention? and
c. Lead to faster, more precise implementation of
effective interventions?
