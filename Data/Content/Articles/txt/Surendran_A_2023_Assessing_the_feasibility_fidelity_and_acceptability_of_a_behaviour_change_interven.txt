Abstract 
Background In Ireland, the agriculture sector reports the highest number of fatalities even though farmers consti-
tute only 6% of the working population. Tractor-related behaviours are implicated in 55% of all vehicle work-related 
fatalities and 25% of reported injuries, and many of these occur in farmyards. There is limited research on the feasibility 
and acceptability of behaviour change interventions to improve tractor safety. Target behaviours that promote safe 
operation in farmyards, determining and addressing blind spots of tractors, were identified, and an intervention was 
developed following the Behaviour Change Wheel Approach. The objective of the study is to examine the feasibility, 
fidelity and acceptability of a behaviour change intervention to enhance the safe operation of tractors in farmyards 
with a particular focus on tractor blind spots.
Method A single group feasibility study will be undertaken. Approximately 16 farmers from four major farm types 
will be recruited for the study between August and September 2022. The intervention involves an in-person demo 
session, facilitated discussion and personalised safety training procedure with safety goals. The study will collect data 
from participants at three time points: baseline (3–10 days prior to the intervention), during the intervention and at 
the follow-up session (7–30 days post-intervention). Quantitative data will be collected through a pre-intervention 
interview and feedback surveys. A pre- and post-intervention qualitative interview will also be conducted with the 
participants and will be supplemented with qualitative data from recruitment logs, observational memos and logs 
and feedback from recruiters. Evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability and fidelity of the intervention will be guided 
by a pre-determined feasibility checklist, fidelity framework and theoretical framework of acceptability, respectively. 
Interviews will be analysed using the content analysis.
Discussion The current study can determine the feasibility and fidelity of delivering a systematic, theoretically driven, 
tailored behaviour change intervention. It will also assess whether the intervention, its ingredients and delivery are

Introduction
Background
Farming is considered a dangerous occupation globally, 
accounting for a high number of occupational accidents 
and fatalities [1]. In Ireland, the farming industry makes 
up only 6% of the workforce [2]. Yet, for decades, the 
agricultural sector reported the highest number of fatal 
incidents of any other economic sector [3]. The Irish 
Agriculture and Food Development Authority (Teagasc) 
National Farm Survey (NFS) reported a 31% increase 
in farm accidents in the last decade in Ireland [4]. Farm 
machines, vehicles and livestock are linked to most of the 
serious incidents on farms [4, 5].
While there have been a variety of initiatives and inter -
ventions to tackle farm accidents and fatalities, a number 
of limitations with these studies have been identified. 
For example, intervention targets have been limited to 
adopting technical solutions or safety guidelines, and 
demographic factors like age and psychosocial factors 
have been often overlooked [6–9]. Farm safety research 
has also historically relied on safety education; however, 
recent reviews have raised questions about the effective -
ness of education programmes to change farm operations 
and individual behaviours [1, 9].
Small-scale farms and family-run farms are regularly 
exempted from compliance with safety regulations, even 
though they work in an isolated environment with lit -
tle to no oversight [10–12]. The lone-working nature of 
farming results in farmers’ being their own bosses; along 
with day-to-day farming responsibilities, they are often 
burdened with the identification of risks and the develop -
ment and implementation of safety plans [9]. This often 
results in farmers prioritising the risk of financial failure 
over the risk of their own injuries by working long hours 
and taking unnecessary risks. These factors also act as 
barriers to adopting preventative safety behaviours such 
as routine maintenance activities [13]. Hence, a change 
in farm operation and farmers’ behaviour is required to 
improve the safety in farms.
Recent reviews indicate that safety interventions have 
been largely focused on the “Three Es”—“Education, 
Engineering and Enforcement” to prevent hazard expo -
sures. Farm research literature clearly indicates that 
psychosocial factors play a crucial role and repeatedly indicates to focus on behavioural-based interven -
tions targeting farmers’ attitudes and behaviours [14, 
15]. The Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance 
for developing and evaluating complex interventions 
underscores the importance of integrating theory and 
available evidence in developing interventions [16]. Evi -
dence emerging from public health research also indi -
cates that behavioural theories and models can help to 
understand the determinants of behaviours, explain the 
behaviour change process to shape the behaviour and 
environment and identify potential behaviour change 
strategies to facilitate long-term changes [17– 20]. 
Injury prevention literature also reports that successful 
strategies incorporated behavioural and environmental 
approaches [18, 19].
Analysis of risk factors and farm accidents indicates 
that demographic factors (e.g. age), farm characteristics, 
psychosocial factors (e.g. normalisation of farm acci -
dents among farming communities and stress) and exter -
nal factors (e.g. seasons and market pressures) influence 
farm safety [3, 21]. With an ageing farming population 
and age-related decline in physical and cognitive health, 
the older age (aged 65 +) group have been identified as 
having more injuries than any other age group [4, 8, 22]. 
A recent review by Nilsson [8] highlighted a lack of focus 
on older farmers in the intervention literature and that 
older farmers are less likely to participate and more likely 
to drop out of the safety initiatives. Previous studies have 
also indicated that the risk factors, behavioural practices 
and motivational factors differ across age groups [3, 13, 
22]. Given that the pattern and impact of accidents vary 
across demographic groups, the needs of these vulner -
able groups should be taken into account in the design of 
targeted intervention programmes in the future.
Development of BeSafe Intervention
BeSafe project is a research programme funded by 
the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine 
(DAFM), Ireland, supported by the Irish Health and 
Safety Authority (HSA) and operated by Teagasc (the 
Irish state agency providing research, advisory and edu -
cation in agriculture) to develop safety interventions to 
bring long-term changes to machine-related safety on 
farms. A lack of clear behavioural targets, limited inte -
gration of theory and limited reporting of the content of

 Surendran et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:114 
 
interventions have been identified as a major gap in exist -
ing farm safety literature [3, 15]. The BeSafe intervention 
was developed as a novel, theory-driven, tailored inter -
vention that aims to address these gaps.
The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework was 
developed by synthesising 19 existing behaviour change 
intervention frameworks to provide a comprehensive and 
systematic approach for developing behaviour change 
interventions [19]. The BCW framework is based on the 
Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) 
model, which suggests that for behaviour to change, an 
individual needs to have the capability, opportunity and 
motivation to engage in the target behaviour. These three 
components are interdependent and influence behaviour 
through multiple interacting factors. The COM-B model 
is linked to the BCW framework as it provides a theo -
retical understanding of behaviour change and helps to 
identify intervention functions, policy categories behav -
iour change techniques (BCTs) to support behaviour 
change. Intervention functions are the broad categories 
of strategies that can be used to change behaviour, such 
as education, training and environmental restructuring. 
BCTs are the observable, replicable and irreducible active 
ingredients of an intervention that can be used to change 
behaviour, such as goal setting, action planning and 
behavioural contract. This framework provides a struc -
tured approach for identifying the target population, tar -
get behaviour and the barriers and facilitators that need 
to be targeted by the intervention. This approach ensures 
that the intervention is tailored to the specific needs 
of the target population, is stakeholder-focused and is 
grounded in theory [23, 24]. Moreover, this approach 
allows for the evaluation of the feasibility, fidelity and 
acceptability of the active ingredients in a systematic and 
rigorous manner [19, 23].
As the first step of the intervention development, we sys -
tematically reviewed the interventions targeting machine-
related accidents on farms [25]. Behavioural components 
present in these selected studies were then mapped to the 
BCW framework, and the behaviour change techniques to 
deliver these intervention functions were coded using the 
BCT taxonomy V1 [24]. Though the review identified nine 
intervention functions and twenty-one BCTs, the effec -
tiveness of the BCTs was not assessed for various reasons, 
including the heterogeneity of the selected studies and 
missing information about the intervention components. 
Findings from the review encouraged the research team 
to create a tailored intervention that addresses vulnerable 
populations such as older farmers and is targeted at spe -
cific farm safety behaviours. Based on the review findings 
and Irish farm fatality reports, it was decided that the qual -
itative study would focus on the safe handling of tractor 
and quad-bike-related among older farmers. In the next phase, we conducted a qualitative study involving focus 
group discussions with older farmers (60 years and above). 
The focus group explored the barriers and facilitators to 
adopting safer tractor and quadbike-related behaviours. 
The findings were then thematically analysed and mapped 
to the COM-B domains. Participants have also suggested 
a few intervention strategies to address them, and the 
research team has mapped them to the BCW intervention 
functions and BCTs using the BCW framework and BCT 
taxonomy V1, respectively. In the next phase, we shared 
the findings from the review and focus groups with the 
panel members of the co-design workshops. Co-design 
workshops with experts and stakeholders identified the 
top target behaviours for the intervention, the potential 
behaviour techniques to address these behaviours and 
strategies for delivering these interventions. The subse -
quent meetings with the Teagasc representatives guided 
the selection and fine-tuning of the target behaviours (spe -
cific farm practices) and the intervention components. 
This exercise determined the usefulness and practicality of 
the intervention components and delivery strategies in the 
Irish farm context and ensured that they aligned with the 
Irish occupational safety approach. A detailed description 
of the intervention development is published elsewhere 
[26]. Intervention content was then mapped to the appro -
priate intervention functions of the BCW.
The BeSafe tractor safety intervention aims to equip 
farmers with knowledge, skills and resources to adopt pre -
ventive safety behaviours to address tractor-related blind 
spots on their farms and improve farm safety. To ensure 
the participation and feedback of older farmers, the study 
will ensure that at least 50% of the participants are aged 
above 60  years. The primary researcher, Teagasc repre -
sentatives (FB and JM) and agricultural machine instruc -
tors conducted multiple mock demos and informally 
tested various aspects, timing and administration, of the 
intervention components to determine the timeline and 
resources for the intervention. The target behaviours (farm 
practices) targeted by the intervention are as follows:
1. Farmers to demonstrate blind spots of tractors to 
family members/co-workers on their farm
2. Farmers to mark the zone of visibility around their 
tractor in a parking area
3. Farmers are to complete a walk around the trac -
tor each time before starting the tractor to check that 
there are no people or obstacles.
The BeSafe intervention is comprised of five interven -
tion functions (Education, Training, Persuasion, Model -
ling and Enablement) and nine BCTs, selected to target 
barriers and facilitators associated with target behav -
iours (see Additional file  1 for the detailed breakdown 
Page 4 of 17 Surendran et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:114 
of the intervention). The intervention involves an in-
person peer-to-peer demonstration session, facilitated 
discussion and personalised safety training procedure 
with safety goals delivered (see Additional file  4 for an 
example safety training procedure form). The Template 
for Intervention DEscription and Replication (TIDieR) 
checklist [27] was used to describe the interven -
tion (see Additional file  7 for TIDieR checklist for the 
BeSafe Programme).
Before evaluating the effectiveness of new interven -
tions, it is recommended that intervention feasibility, 
fidelity and acceptability be assessed [16]. Complications 
that arise from the delivery, fidelity and acceptability can 
be effectively identified during a feasibility study, thus 
providing an opportunity to refine or modify before 
a larger effectiveness trial [16, 28]. Guided by Bowen 
et al. ’s [29] framework for conducting feasibility studies, 
the current study will focus on the feasibility of imple -
menting the intervention in an Irish farm setting, imple -
mentation of the intervention as intended (fidelity) and 
acceptability and adoption among recipients [29–31].
Findings from the study have the potential to inform 
the development of a full-scale randomised trial to eval -
uate its effectiveness in increasing safety practices on 
farms. Evidence emerging from the study also can inform 
future farm safety research on the feasibility and fidelity 
of implementing behaviour-change-based interventions 
and the acceptance of BCTs among farmers.
Method/design
Aim
This feasibility study protocol aims to outline the evaluation 
plans of the BeSafe intervention programme and provide 
a comprehensive description of the methods that will be 
used to assess its feasibility, fidelity and acceptability. The 
manuscript is structured in a way that describes the inter -
vention and its theoretical underpinnings, the study design 
and methods, recruitment and participant selection crite -
ria, proposed outcome measures and data analysis plans.
The objectives of the feasibility study are:
1. To assess the feasibility of recruiting the participants 
and delivering the intervention, which includes the 
recruitment, retention, adherence and completion of 
the intervention
2. To assess the fidelity of the design, training, delivery, 
receipt and enactment of the intervention
3. To evaluate the acceptability of the active compo -
nents of the intervention among the participants
4. To identify participants’ perceived barriers and enablers 
to participating in, and completing, the interventionStudy design
This is a single-group feasibility trial. The study will use 
a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods 
to evaluate the intervention, including an exit survey 
and in-depth interviews with participants to gain insight 
into their experiences. Therefore, as per the guidance 
provided by the MRC framework for the feasibility trial, 
a mixed methods approach will be taken, as it will ena -
ble the integration of both quantitative and qualitative 
data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of 
the intervention [32– 34]. The duration of the study will 
be 30–45 days based on the recommendation of stake -
holders and the time limitation of the project. Baseline 
data collection will start at the beginning mid of August 
2022, and the post-intervention interview sessions are 
estimated to be completed in approximately 2 months. 
The flow chart of the study is shown in Fig.  1. This pro -
tocol is reported according to Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 
reporting guidelines (see Additional file  8 for SPIRIT 
Checklist) [35].
The participants’ demographic information will be 
collected during the pre-intervention interview, and 
descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the data. 
Short message service (SMS) surveys and exit surveys 
will explore the immediate feedback of the participants 
and the adoption of skills in their farm settings after the 
intervention. Post-intervention qualitative interviews will 
explore the feasibility of adopting the target behaviour, 
perceived acceptability and sub-constructs of fidelity. 
Content analysis [36] will be used to analyse the inter -
view and survey data. Details of the data collected are 
provided in the ‘ data collection ’ section.
The AgriDemo-F2F (Agricultural Demonstrations 
and Farmer-to-Farmer Learning towards Sustain -
able Agriculture) is a European Commission-funded 
project that aims to enhance peer-to-peer learning 
within the farming community by building an interac -
tive agridemo-hub community to promote practices 
and research-based farming solutions. The project is 
built on the principles of participatory and experiential 
learning, recognising that farmers learn best by seeing 
and doing [35, 37, 38]. The community provides guide -
lines and tools to design, implement and evaluate effec -
tive farmer-to-farmer learning approaches [35, 39–41]. 
As the current study involves peer-to-peer demonstra -
tion, we have incorporated participatory elements by 
following the recommendations and tools provided 
by the initiative. This will enhance participant engage -
ment and comfort, and increase the effectiveness of the 
demonstration.

Sample size
No formal sample size calculation was performed. There 
are several rules of thumb, ranging from 12 to 35 partici -
pants per group, for the pilot and feasibility studies [42, 
43]. This study aims to recruit a minimum of 16 partici -
pants, just in excess of the minimum recommended sam -
ple size of 12, to compensate for the anticipated dropout. 
Other determining factors of the size were the availability 
of local resources and the maximum number of partici -
pants the research team could address in a session.
Study setting
Teagasc is the semi-state authority in the Republic of Ire -
land responsible for research and development, training 
and advisory services in the agro-food sector. Teagasc 
personnel will assist the research team with:
1. Recruitment of the participants
2. Facilitation of in-person event
3. Arranging the demo site
4. Securing the site of intervention
All participants will be Irish farmers in contact with 
the Teagasc in the Republic of Ireland. The study will be 
conducted in selected Teagasc centres in the Republic of 
Ireland. To ensure the safety of the participants, the risks 
associated with each farm equipment that will be used 
in the intervention along with the preventive measures 
will be discussed during the session. Teagasc facilita -
tors will be present on the demo site from the time of 
the preparation of the demo site to the conclusion of the 
event. One day before each demo, Teagasc safety offic -
ers will do a mandatory risk assessment and ensure that 
the demo site is safe for everyone. Safety checks will be 
done according to the HSA farm safety code of practice 
for risk assessment [44].
Eligibility criteria
The average age of farmers in Ireland is 57, and fatal inci -
dents involving farmers aged 65 or older account for 45% 
of farm safety incidents [3, 45]. In the previous interven -
tions, the age range for “older farmers” varies between 55 
[8, 46] and 65 [47], depending on the context of the study, 
but for this project, it was defined as those aged 60 and 
above. The intervention is primarily designed for older 
farmers, but younger farmers will be included in the trial 
to examine the generalizability of outcomes and tailor the 
intervention for different age groups.
Inclusion criteria
• Currently working on farms part/full time• Aged 18 years or older
• Have access to facilities and opportunities to share 
their learning from the study with someone who is 
not part of the study, such as a family member, neigh -
bour or co-worker
Exclusion criteria
• Participants who report emotional distress about 
farm incidents and safety
• Intend to participate in any other farm interventions 
during the study period
• Non-English speakers
Recruitment strategy
Previous farm studies reported low participation and 
high attrition among older farmers [8, 22]. To ensure the 
participation of older farmers, at least half of the par -
ticipants will be above 60  years of age. Details on the 
involvement of older farmers at the development stage of 
the study will be discussed in a separate publication.
The recruitment will be primarily carried out with the 
help of the Teagasc farm advisors using a purposive sam -
pling strategy. At the beginning of the recruitment pro -
cess, advisors will contact the eligible farmers to discuss 
the benefits of the research for farmers. To maximise the 
representation of different demographic groups, 50% of 
the participants will be aged above 60 years, and farmers 
from four major farm types, dairy, beef, sheep and till -
age, will be recruited. The refusal rate and the reason for 
refusal cited by the farmers will be recorded. The research 
team will send the information sheet and consent form 
to the interested candidates. The contact details of the 
research team will be provided in case the participants 
have any questions. Once the participants sign the con -
sent form and send it via post or email to the research 
team, the team will arrange a convenient time to conduct 
the pre-intervention phone call. During the call, before 
proceeding with baseline data collection, the researcher 
will talk the participant through the procedure to ensure 
they fully understand what they are consenting to and is 
comfortable talking about fatal incidents and safety. This 
will be then followed by demographic data collection (see 
Additional file 3 for an example topic guide).
To ensure maximum retention, participants will be 
offered vouchers at the completion of each stage of the 
study. Every participant who completes all stages of the 
study will receive vouchers worth 100 euros by the end 
of the study. The introduction session is also intended 
Page 7 of 17
 Surendran et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:114 
 
to create a rapport between the research team and the 
participants.
Withdrawal of study participants
Participants will be given a minimum of 2 weeks to make 
the decision about their participation and every oppor -
tunity to clarify any enquiries they have related to the 
project. Participants will be informed at every stage of 
the programme that they can withdraw from the study 
without any penalty and without giving any reason. Par -
ticipants may get re-allocated to a different session or 
removed from the study by the researcher if they exhibit 
any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 infec -
tion. The data collected from that participant up to that 
point will be considered for evaluation unless specifically 
requested by the participant to delete it.
Procedure
Participation in the study includes four stages. The stages 
and their timeline is as shown in the flow diagram. Once 
the participant expresses interest and provides consent, 
the primary author will contact them to collect the base -
line data and confirm their attendance at the in-person 
event. The intervention involves a half-day in-person 
event and identical demo sessions with a maximum of six 
participants in each session will be conducted. The maxi -
mum number of participants per session was determined 
per the recommendation of agridemo guidelines [35, 48] 
and feedback from the informal demo session. Partici -
pants can choose to participate in any one of the sessions 
based on their convenience. At the end of the interven -
tion, participants will be asked to complete an exit sur -
vey to share their feedback about the intervention (see 
Additional file  5 for an example exit survey). The primary 
author will send an SMS survey after 7  days to moni -
tor the participant’s progress in the adoption of safety 
goals (target behaviours). All participants will be invited 
to take part in an online interview within 20 days of the 
intervention to assess the perceived acceptability of the 
intervention among participants.
Materials
The participants will be provided with all materials to 
implement the safety strategies demonstrated and dis -
cussed in the intervention session.
Data collection
Baseline assessments
The primary author will collect demographic data and 
the safety devices currently used by the participant dur -
ing the introductory session (stage 1) using a pre-pre -
pared questionnaire (see Additional file  1 for an example 
questionnaire).Follow‑up assessments
Immediately after completing the intervention ses -
sion, participants will be requested to fill out an anony -
mous exit survey. An exit survey is a modified version of 
the feedback form provided as a part of the EU H2020 
AgriDemo [35, 40, 48]. The objective of this survey is to 
gather participants’ immediate feedback on the accept -
ability of intervention components. This information may 
also help to gain the feedback of participants who may 
drop out before the post-intervention interview and is 
expected to support the researchers in refining the inter -
view guide for the qualitative interview. The convenient 
time to receive the SMS survey and set up the interview 
would also be collected at the end of the session.
The SMS survey is intended to remind and track the 
progress made by the participants on the adoption of 
the safety goals at their farms. The follow-up evaluation 
interview will be a 1-h semi-structured online inter -
view to explore perceived acceptability, measure receipt 
of treatment and enactment of skills (see Additional 
file 6 for an example topic guide). While the SMS survey 
measures the progress on the completion of safety goals 
(home-based tasks), the interview will further explore 
their experience with performing the tasks at home and if 
they faced any barriers to completing the activities.
Study outcomes and measures
A summary of the objective, measures and tools to assess 
the outcomes are provided in the table.
Feasibility outcomes
Consideration of feasibility criteria was guided by the 
agriculture literature and feasibility study guidelines [29, 
49]. Feasibility will be measured based on the criteria 
detailed in Table 1.
These criteria will be evaluated through an intervention 
checklist, direct observation, audio recording of the in-
person intervention sessions and reported experience of 
the facilitators.
Additionally, the current study will recruit farmers who 
have opportunities to demonstrate the learnings from 
the intervention to a non-participant person. During the 
feasibility evaluation, the authors will examine the report 
from the recruiters to determine whether this criterion 
came up as a barrier to recruitment or retention. This is 
especially relevant as farming in Ireland is generally small 
scale, with an average farm size of fewer than 14 ha, and 
farmers regularly meet through discussion groups or 
similar events [50, 51]. Peer-to-peer demonstration and 
facilitated discussion present a unique opportunity for 
knowledge sharing and learning within the community.

Fidelity of the intervention
Existing reviews indicate that the fidelity of the inter -
ventions is not often measured, reported or accounted 
for in the research [52, 53]. Measuring fidelity can 
not only ensure that core components are delivered 
as intended but also measure how it is delivered, the 
quality of the delivery and participants’ engagement 
[52]. Following international guidance, five compo -
nents of fidelity, treatment design (the degree to which 
the delivery adhered to the behaviour change theory 
that informed the design), provider training (adequacy 
of the training and resources to deliver intervention), 
intervention delivery (the degree to which the inter -
vention components were delivered as intended), 
intervention receipt (the degree to which the recipi -
ents demonstrate the ability to understand and per -
form the safety practices), and enactment (the degree 
to which recipients execute the practices in their own 
farms), will be assessed [54, 55]. By systematically 
assessing different aspects of the fidelity of the inter -
vention, researchers can identify where there might be 
gaps or discrepancies between what was intended and 
what is actually delivered. Moreover, measuring receipt 
helps to ensure that the intervention was delivered as 
intended and to the correct audience. Enactment, on 
the other hand, provides an accurate representation 
of participants’ actual performance of intervention 
skills or implementation of the core intervention com -
ponents in the intended situation. This information is 
important for improving the intervention’s replicability 
and generalizability [54].
In order to measure how well the intervention is deliv -
ered as intended, the fidelity of design, training and 
delivery will be assessed by the primary author using a 
pre-established checklist. To evaluate the participants’ 
understanding of the intervention components and appli -
cation of the intervention skills in their day-to-day life, 
the fidelity of receipt and enactment will be explored in 
the follow-up assessment [54, 56].
Since the intervention is delivered by the research team, 
no training is required. However, the authors will be pub -
lishing an intervention manual for future studies, which 
will address the resources, skills and training required.
Acceptability of the intervention
A review of farm safety interventions observed that 
even when the researchers report the intervention and 
its delivery, they provide little to no information on per -
ceived acceptability for the programme among partici -
pants [57]. Given that perceived acceptability reflects the 
extent to which the intervention was perceived as appro -
priate, the successful adoption of the intervention relies 
on it [58, 59].During the intervention development phase, the study 
utilised the BCW framework to identify BCTs for inclu -
sion in the intervention. As part of this process, the 
APEASE (Acceptability, Practicability, Effectiveness, 
Affordability, Spill-over effects, and Equity) criteria were 
utilised to ensure that the selected BCTs met the neces -
sary criteria of being acceptable, practical and effective 
[23]. However, to evaluate the acceptability of the inter -
vention and its components among participants, the 
study will use the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability 
(TFA) framework. The TFA framework is a comprehen -
sive and flexible framework that provides a structured 
approach to understanding the acceptability of interven -
tions. It enables researchers to explore how participants 
feel about the intervention and why they feel that way. 
The study will explore the seven component constructs 
of TFA: Affective attitude, Burden, Ethicality, Interven -
tion coherence, Opportunity costs, Perceived effective -
ness and Self-efficacy [59]. By breaking down the concept 
of acceptability into several domains, the TFA framework 
allows researchers to identify which aspects of the inter -
vention are most important to participants and where 
there might be issues with acceptability. This informa -
tion is essential for tailoring the intervention to meet the 
needs and preferences of the target population, which 
can increase its uptake and effectiveness.
The follow-up assessment involves an in-depth inter -
view that will explore the participant’s retrospective 
perceptions of the acceptability of the intervention, the 
expectations and experiences of the intervention, and its 
key components.
Data analysis
As per the pilot and feasibility studies guidelines, quanti -
tative data analysis will be descriptive [60, 61]. The demo -
graphic characteristic of participants and the use of safety 
devices on their farms will be summarised using descrip -
tive analysis. Qualitative data will be audio-recorded and 
transcribed verbatim using a third-party transcription 
service. Transcribed data, along with survey data, docu -
mented field notes and memos, will be managed using 
MaxQDA 2020 [62] and analysed by the primary author 
using content analysis to explore the feasibility, fidelity 
and perceived acceptability. To ensure the accuracy and 
reliability of the data analysis, a rigorous process will 
be followed. To begin with, half of the transcripts will 
undergo double coding by two independent researchers. 
The remaining transcripts will be coded by AS alone. In 
case of any discrepancies in the coding, the researchers 
will discuss and arrive at a consensus.
During the evaluation design phase, reported outcomes 
of previous farm interventions were considered while 
determining the factors for measuring the programme’s 
Page 14 of 17 Surendran et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:114 
success. For example, farm safety literature suggests that 
25–77% of the farmers contacted could be expected to 
agree to participate [63– 67], and an average of 80–100% 
satisfaction was reported among the participants with the 
previous farm safety intervention programmes [9 , 67, 68]. 
Since the study will be conducted in the summer, farmers’ 
busy work schedules and vacation plans are also expected 
to influence participation and retention [69]. To measure 
treatment fidelity, the study will adhere to the National 
Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium guide -
lines, which define high treatment fidelity as having more 
than 80% adherence to the intervention checklist [49]. The 
researchers will use the intervention checklist, which pro -
vides a clear outline of the key components of the inter -
vention and serves as a guide for implementation. The 
researchers will evaluate adherence by comparing the 
actual implementation of the intervention to the check -
list and assessing the percentage of key components that 
were successfully implemented. The criteria outlined in 
Table  1 are established a priori to evaluate the success of 
the study, specifically the feasibility of implementing the 
intervention, the extent to which participants received the 
intended intervention and the acceptability of the inter -
vention among participants. If some of the criteria are not 
met, the authors will investigate the potential causes of 
failures and consider changes to the intervention compo -
nents and its delivery methods before deciding whether to 
recommend the development of a future larger trial to test 
the effectiveness of the intervention.
Data management and monitoring
All participants will be assigned an identification number 
and a pseudonym, which will be used for the discussion of 
transcripts by the research team and in the publication of 
the study results. Consent forms and audio/video/electronic 
recordings could all contain information that could be used 
to identify a participant. Audio and video recordings will be 
deleted after transcribing them. Forms and transcribed data 
will be retained for 7 years. Hard copies, if any, will be stored 
in a locked filing cabinet within a restricted area. Access to 
this filing cabinet will be restricted to the study personnel 
and will be overseen by the principal investigator. Soft cop -
ies and Electronic recordings of meetings will be password 
protected and will be stored on a OneDrive/SharePoint net -
work of the research sponsor. Access to these files will be 
overseen by the principal investigator. Due to the low risks 
associated with this behavioural intervention, there are no 
pre-specified interim analyses or stopping rules. Due to 
the low risks associated with this behavioural intervention, 
the study anticipates minimal occurrence of adverse events 
directly associated with the intervention. Any adverse 
events will be reviewed by the study team according to the 
Teagasc Advisory Discussion Group safety guidelines.Discussion
This paper describes the protocol for a feasibility study 
that explores the feasibility, fidelity and acceptability of 
a novel intervention to address blind spots of tractors.
Evidence indicates that behavioural interventions have 
the potential to address the health habits of the popula -
tion at a low cost [70]. Yet, the active adoption of behav -
ioural change techniques in farm research has been slow. 
This study will provide useful information that will aid 
in adopting various BCTs to increase the knowledge, 
intention to adopt and adherence to preventive farm 
practices. Previous reviews and our own review of the 
farm safety literature identified a gap in theory-driven 
intervention development as well as the reporting and 
assessment of its active ingredients [1 , 6, 7, 71]. The 
intervention content and the evaluation procedure are 
described in this study, which will enable the replication 
or adoption of the intervention or one of its ingredients 
in future studies.
Conclusions
This study is limited, in generalisation, due to the small 
sample size. However, by evaluating intervention content 
and delivery, the study is expected to provide evidence 
of the feasibility of each ingredient, its delivery and its 
acceptance among participants. This could facilitate farm 
safety researchers to create and implement behavioural 
change theory-centred, tailored, and targeted strategies 
to address farm safety.
