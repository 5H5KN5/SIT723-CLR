Abstract
Background: In this protocol, we outline a mixed-methods randomized feasibility trial of Brief Relaxation, Education
and Trauma Healing (BREATHE) Ethiopia. BREATHE Ethiopia is a culturally and contextually adapted intervention for
PTSD in participants with severe mental illness. BREATHE Ethiopia maps onto the World Health Organization ’s
guidelines for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment in low- and middle-income country primary care
settings.
Methods: Specifically, this study includes a non-randomized pre-pilot ( n= 5) and a randomized feasibility trial
comparing BREATHE Ethiopia to Treatment as Usual ( n= 40) to assess trial procedures, acceptability, and feasibility
of intervention delivery, and investigate potential effectiveness and implementation. In a process evaluation, we will
collect data that will be critical for a future fully randomized controlled trial, including the numbers of participants
who are eligible, who consent, who engage in treatment, and who complete the assessments, as well as the
feasibility and acceptability of assessments and the intervention. Qualitative data on facilitators and barriers to
intervention delivery and quantitative data on provider fidelity to the intervention and participant and provider
satisfaction will also be collected. Quantitative assessments at baseline, post-treatment, 1-month follow-up, and 3-
month follow-up will assess change in mental health symptoms and functional impairment and hypothesized
intervention mechanisms, including knowledge about PTSD, stigma, trauma-related cognitions, and physiological
arousal.
Discussion: Findings from this study will inform a future fully-powered randomized controlled trial, and if found to
be effective, the intervention has the potential to be integrated into mental healthcare scale-up efforts in other
low-resource settings.

Introduction
In most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), se-
vere mental illness (SMI), including psychotic and bipo-
lar disorders, is a priority condition for treatment in
primary care [ 1]. In high-income countries (HICs), 25 –
50% of people with SMI are thought to have posttrau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) [ 2,3]. Trauma exposure,
particularly childhood abuse, has been identified as a risk
factor for subsequent SMI [ 4–8], and SMI symptoms
have been linked to increased risk of trauma [ 9,10].
Moreover, SMI symptoms and associated treatment, in-
cluding forced hospitalization and restraint, may also be
distressing and traumatic events themselves [ 11–14].
For people with SMI, comorbid PTSD is associated
with more severe SMI symptoms, greater functional im-
pairment, and worse treatment outcomes [ 15–19].
Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for PTSD in people
with comorbid SMI are often effective in addressing
PTSD symptoms [ 20–23]. However, these interventions
were developed in HICs, and have not been evaluated in
LMICs. Successful implementation of a psychotherapy
intervention in Ethiopian primary care may provide a
framework for interventions in other low-resource pri-
mary care settings, including those in HICs, where co-
morbid PTSD and SMI is usually overlooked, and
integration of EBIs for comorbid PTSD and SMI remains
minimal [ 10,13,24–32].
Despite the fact that PTSD may be higher in conflict-
affected LMICs, and at least as prevalent in non-conflict
LMIC settings, as compared to HICs [ 33–36], many
LMICs have extremely limited mental health services
making implementation of EBIs challenging [ 37,38].
Low-income countries have less than one mental health
provider per 100,000 people (compared to more than 50
in HICs), and almost all mental health services in low-
income countries are provided in hospitals in large cities,
with virtually no care available in rural areas [ 38–40].
Given the dearth of mental health specialists, primary
care may be best positioned to address mental health in
LMICs [ 41,42], not just as an efficient means to address
symptoms, but also because it provides care in the com-
munities where people live, may be less stigmatizing,
and has potential to integrate physical and mental health
needs of people with SMI.
While integration of mental health services at the pri-
mary care level is critical, there are barriers that must be
addressed [ 43]. In Ethiopia, like many LMICs, primary
care clinics are staffed by providers with little training in
mental health, limited time, and high staff turnover [ 43–
47]. Rural populations also face barriers to care includ-
ing lower literacy rates, large distances to clinics [ 43,47,
48], and low awareness of, and high stigma related to,
mental health concerns [ 49–51]. Despite these chal-
lenges, efforts are being made to implement evidence-based packages of care for people with SMI in Ethiopian
primary care [ 44,48,52]. Although some interventions
for PTSD have been adapted for use in LMICs, trials
have excluded people with SMI [ 53–56]. Likewise, only a
handful of psychosocial intervention studies for SMI
have been conducted in LMICs, none of which assessed
PTSD [ 57–60].
In this protocol, we describe a mixed methods ran-
domized feasibility trial of Brief Relaxation, Education,
and Trauma Healing (BREATHE) Ethiopia, a culturally
and contextually adapted intervention for PTSD in pa-
tients with SMI [ 61]. BREATHE Ethiopia was selected
for its brevity, its demonstrated effectiveness comparable
to first line PTSD treatments, development for use with
patients with comorbid SMI, and to address the pre-
existing barriers in this low resource primary care set-
ting, such as limited time and lack of staff with mental
health training, that may preclude longer more complex
treatments [ 62]. The aim is to test procedures for a fully
powered trial and investigate implementation outcomes
and potential effectiveness in a LMIC. Methods are dis-
cussed according to Standard Protocol Items: Recom-
mendations for International Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines
and all elements of the SPIRIT checklist are reported
below [ 63].
Method
Study setting
The study setting is the primary health care (PHC)
clinics and hospitals in and around Sodo and South
Sodo districts. Selection of the health facilities will be
based on an evaluation of the number of participants re-
ceiving mental health care, the accessibility of the clinic,
the interest of the providers and facility leadership, and
the other studies currently being run at each primary
care facility. Sodo and South Sodo districts were the sites
of the PRogramme for Improving Mental health care
(PRIME) in Ethiopia [ 44]. This region is 90% rural and
most of the 180,000 people live in villages widely spread
apart and difficult to access. There is one primary hos-
pital with general practitioner physicians, nurses, and
health officers, and an outpatient psychiatric clinic run
by a psychiatric nurse. There are also eight primary care
clinics staffed by nurses and health officers. The number
of staff per health center ranges from eight to 24, and
there is high staff turnover. Approximately 20,000 to
40,000 people are served by each clinic.
PRIME was a large-scale, multi-country mental health
services research program that investigated the imple-
mentation of evidence-based packages of mental health
care integrated into primary care in Sodo District [ 44,
48,52]. Although PRIME has concluded, the infrastruc-
ture that PRIME established will be leveraged for this
project. PRIME has trained health extension workersNget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 2 of 15
(community health workers) to detect people with prob-
able psychosis, including schizophrenia and bipolar dis-
order, and refer them to the local PHC facility. In that
facility, primary care staff have been trained to carry out
an assessment, make a diagnosis, prescribe psychotropic
medication, provide psychoeducation, basic psychosocial
care, support and monitoring, and refer if needed, for
more intensive services to the primary hospital and to
the specialty psychiatric hospital in Addis Ababa [ 44].
PRIME enrolled and delivered care to 300 patients with
SMI, and helped train primary care staff, psychologists,
and psychiatric nurses who might participate as inter-
ventionists or act as supervisors [ 44]. Finally, PRIME de-
veloped strong collaborations with local service users,
caregivers, providers, and leaders, and has conducted
formative research on stakeholder engagement, health
system needs, and social, political and economic con-
texts [ 43,44,64].
Selection and training of primary health care providers
Once primary care facilities have been identified, the
local government leadership will be approached for as-
sistance in identifying providers to train at each health
center. Providers who have received mhGAP training
and who are currently providing mental health services
will be prioritized. Providers who are not selected for
participation, but who also provide mental health ser-
vices will be eligible to participate as treatment as usual
(TAU) providers.
Using participatory methods, case scenarios, role plays,
and video clips, we will train primary care staff and su-
pervisors to deliver the adapted intervention. Training
will be delivered through a multi-component package in-
volving feedback, consultation, and supervision. We an-
ticipate that training will be 5 days and will involve
extensive role-play and case studies. Given current on-
going restrictions, training will be conducted virtually.
Before and after the 5-day training and after the pre-
pilot, providers will be rated on their clinical skills using
a standardized participant role play and will be evaluated
by the PI of the study, and clinical supervisors using a
tool (see Appendix 1) created for this intervention on
their fidelity to the intervention and their skill in
delivering the hypothesized active ingredients of the
intervention including (1) breathing retraining, (2) psy-
choeducation, (3) positive coping, and (4) homework as-
signment and review. In addition, they will also be
assessed on common therapeutic elements such as re-
flective listening and rapport building using the Enhan-
cing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors
(ENACT) measure [ 65] and their knowledge of trauma
and PTSD using an adapted version of the PTSD Know-
ledge Test, which has been used previously to assess
change in PTSD knowledge after the BREATHEintervention [ 66]. Final provider selection for both the
pre-pilot and the randomized feasibility trial will be
based on provider interest and motivation, and the re-
sults of the post-training proficiency testing and ENACT
and PTSD Knowledge test ratings.
Supervision of the primary care providers
Ongoing supervision, consultation, and coaching during
the pilot will be conducted using a “supervise the super-
visors ”model. Supervisors will be Ethiopian clinical psy-
chologists who have experience working with individuals
with SMI. LN will provide weekly virtual supervision to
the supervisors over the phone, who will in turn provide
weekly and as-needed supervision to the health center
staff in person or over the phone. All supervision ses-
sions will be audiotaped and coded to identify themes
discussed and potential challenges and strengths of the
intervention.
In order to facilitate rapid understanding of the inter-
vention and to improve training and supervision of pro-
viders, participants in the pre-pilot will be asked to
complete treatment sessions twice a week and to com-
mit to completing all five sessions in 2.5 weeks. During
the pre-pilot, providers will receive supervision twice per
week and supervisors will observe at least one session
per provider in person and will complete ENACT ratings
for every session they observe in person. In addition, all
sessions will be audio recorded and will be rated for fi-
delity to the intervention (see Appendix 1) within 1 day
of the session taking place. Supervisors and providers
will receive fidelity ratings from previous sessions, to be
discussed and problem solved during supervision.
During the randomized feasibility trial, intervention
sessions will be audio recorded, and supervisors and pri-
mary care providers will review clips of the sessions dur-
ing supervision. A random sample of 50% of sessions
will be rated for fidelity to the intervention and fidelity
ratings will be provided to supervisors and providers for
discussion during supervision.
Participant eligibility, screening, and consenting
See Fig. 1for the steps of the pre-pilot and the random-
ized feasibility trial study design. Primary health care
providers will be asked to provide a list of all the poten-
tial participants patients who meet the following inclu-
sion criteria: (1) at least 18 years old; (2) able to
complete procedures in Amharic; and (3) have met with
a provider at the health facility for a mental health prob-
lem and/or received a psychotropic medication from the
primary health facility in the last year. Providers will
then be oriented to the concept of “consent for re-
search. ”For each identified patient, providers will select
“Yes,”“No,”or“Don’t know ”whether patients are cogni-
tively able to consent for research. Patients who areNget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 3 of 15
rated “Yes”will be contacted by research staff to be
given informed consent to participate in the screening
study. Patients that are deemed “Don’t know ”will be
contacted to be assessed for the ability to consent by a
psychiatric nurse using a capacity to consent rating form
[67] and if they are rated by the nurse as being able to
consent, they will be given informed consent. Patients
who are rated “No”will not be contacted for participa-
tion. After patients are identified as being able to con-
sent for research by health providers or the psychiatric
nurse, if a phone number or home location is available,
research staff will contact patients directly to see if theyare interested in participating and being screened. If
contact information is not available, patients will be
identified and approached for participation as they come
into the health facilities for clinical services. During the
initial screening, eligible participants will be asked for
preferred contact information.
Participants who provide informed consent to be
screened for the study will be provided with 100 Ethiopian
Birr (ETB; $2.70 USD) for participating in screening.
Screening will occur in two steps. Step one of the screen-
ing involves participants providing self-report responses to
the following measures administered by a data collector:Fig. 1 Steps of study designNget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 4 of 15
Sociodemographics
The PRIME sociodemographic questionnaire will collect
data on participant sex, age, education, marital status,
family income, and food insecurity [ 52,68].
Trauma exposure
Trauma exposure will be assessed using an adapted ver-
sion of the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 [ 69] that in-
cludes items that were found to be relevant for the
target population during qualitative studies (i.e., animal
attack, drowning/near drowning, abduction for marriage
without consent).
Self-reported PTSD symptoms
PTSD symptoms will be assessed using the qualitatively
adapted PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 [ 70] which includes
suicidal ideation resulting from trauma exposure.
Functional impairment
Functional impairment will be assessed using a 12-item
version of the WHODAS-2 to assess functional impair-
ment [ 71].
Participants who meet the following inclusion criteria
will be given a second informed consent and will proceed
to step two of the screening process: Identified as having
(a) experienced a traumatic event; (b) associated PTSD
symptoms defined as scores on the PTSD Checklist DSM-
5 (PCL-5) [ 70]r a t e da s2= “Moderately ”or higher for at
least four items —(we have a low threshold of symptoms
because we do not know what the validated cut off or
presentation of PTSD is in Ethiopia); and (c) any associ-
ated functional impairment on the WHODAS-2 (i.e.,
scores of 1 or higher on any item) [ 71].
Participants who meet criteria and consent for further
screening for the trial will be provided with 100 ETB for
further screening and will proceed to step two of the
screening which involves being assessed by a psychiatric
nurse for (a) Capacity to Consent to both the BREATHE
intervention and to the research study using a rating scale
to assess participant capacity to consent to the study [ 67];
(b)Clinician -rated PTSD symptoms and diagnosis using
the past-month version of the Clinician Administered
PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) [ 72]; (c) SMI symptoms
using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Expanded Version
4.0 (BPRS-4.0) [ 73]; and (d) Suicidal ideation using the
Suicidal Ideation module of the CIDI [ 74].
Participants who meet the following inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria will be consented for participation in the
pre-pilot or randomized feasibility trial: determined by the
psychiatric nurse to (1) be cognitively and functionally
capable of attending and participating in the therapy ses-
sions; (2) be cognitively and functionally capable of pro-
viding informed consent for research and randomization;
(3) be not currently high risk of suicide as measured by anendorsement of current or recent suicide plan or attempt
on the CIDI Suicide module and psychiatric nurse clinical
assessment of suicide risk; and (4) have a diagnosis of
PTSD. Participants who are identified as having current
high suicide risk will be followed up by primary care pro-
viders and receive referrals for higher levels of care, as
needed. At any point in the study if patients exhibit dis-
tress and/or increasing severity of symptoms that warrants
a higher level of care, they will be referred to the district
hospital or to Butajira hospital or to Amanuel, the tertiary
psychiatric hospital in Addis Ababa.
Pre-pilot and intervention refinement
The first five participants who meet all inclusion criteria
and consent to the study will receive the adapted inter-
vention as part of the pre-pilot. Participants in the pre-
pilot will be asked to complete treatment sessions twice
a week and to commit to completing all five sessions in
2.5 weeks. To account for this intensive schedule, partic-
ipants will be provided 100 ETB ($2.70 USD) for each
treatment session and will be drawn from communities
that are close to the health facilities. Each provider who
will be delivering the treatment in the randomized feasi-
bility trial will deliver the intervention to one participant
in the pre-pilot phase (anticipated n= 5).
After all of the pre-pilot participants complete their
post-treatment quantitative and qualitative assessments
and satisfaction ratings, the quantitative results will be
summarized. The audio recordings of the qualitative in-
terviews will be analyzed using rapid assessment [ 75,76]
to facilitate efficient analysis and enable us to use results
to improve the intervention and/or research processes
before the start of the randomized feasibility pilot trial.
The providers will participate in an audio-recorded focus
group to understand their experiences during the pre-
pilot and to gather data on ways that the intervention
and research protocols could be improved.
In addition, two theory of change (ToC) workshops
[77] will be convened, one with the providers and super-
visors who participated in the pre-pilot, and one with
the participants who participated in the pre-pilot. The
ToC workshops will be used to understand the mecha-
nisms of action in the intervention and to further refine
the manual.
Any needed changes to the intervention or research
protocol that were identified during the post-
intervention qualitative interviews with participants, the
focus group with providers, or either of the ToC work-
shops will be implemented prior to the start of partici-
pant enrollment for the randomized feasibility trial. The
research team will complete the TIDieR checklist [ 78]t o
document any changes and their rationale that occurred
after pre-piloting. A second TIDieR checklist will be
completed after the feasibility trial is complete.Nget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 5 of 15
Intervention
BREATHE Ethiopia is a treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms for use with individ-
uals who have a diagnosis of PTSD or “probable PTSD. ”
This program is adapted from the “B.R.E.A.T.H.E. —Brief
Relaxation, Education and Trauma HEaling: A Brief
Intervention for Persons with PTSD and Co-Occurring
Serious Mental Health Conditions ”[79].
This intervention is designed to be delivered in primary
care and fits within the Ethiopian Ministry of Health ’s
mandate to expand the care for people living with mental
health conditions. Given the technical challenges in the
field the intervention is designed to be delivered in person
and has been adapted to follow mitigation procedures as
per current ongoing restrictions. The program meets the
guidelines provided by the World Health Organization ’s
Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) module on
the Assessment and Management of Conditions
Specifically Related to Stress [ 1]. The intervention was cul-
turally and contextually adapted using qualitative semi-
structured interview data from 48 participants including
patients with SMI ( n=1 3 ) ;c a r e g i v e r so fp a t i e n t sw i t h
SMI ( n= 13); health care providers ( n= 13); and commu-
nity and religious leaders ( n=9 )f r o mS o d oD i s t r i c t ,
Ethiopia [ 80]. Adaptations were made to the intervention
delivery and content.
Intervention delivery adaptations included changing
(1) the session number and length from three 50-min
sessions to five 20- to 30-min sessions, to accommodate
the needs of the primary health care centers; and (2) the
frequency of sessions from once a week to anywhere
from once a week to once a month, to accommodate
travel difficulties for patients and to map onto the nor-
mal frequency with which patients visit the primary care
facilities for medication management follow-up visits.
Content adaptations included (1) adding in positive cop-
ing skills and practices that were identified from the
qualitative data and that were feasible in the rural Ethi-
opian context, such as purposeful engagement in posi-
tive activities; (2) changing the language to be more
acceptable and understandable in Amharic (for example,
changing “hyperarousal ”to“over alertness ”); (3) adding
in psychoeducation about SMI symptoms and stigma;
and (4) providing more guidance to providers on com-
munication strategies, specifically ways to present the
intervention in encouraging, normalizing, and non-
stigmatizing ways.
The intervention consists of three main parts spread
over five brief treatment sessions: (1) breathing retrain-
ing: participants are taught and encouraged to use
breathing retraining to reduce current or anticipated
physiological arousal that is associated with anxiety.
Breathing retraining is taught in the first session and
reviewed in all subsequent sessions; (2) normalizingthrough psychoeducation: the intervention teaches par-
ticipants and (with participants ’permission) their fam-
ilies about the commonness of trauma, trauma
symptoms, and related problems so that they understand
that their reactions are normal and experienced by other
people too. This information is presented using informa-
tion handouts, worksheets, and discussion; and (3) posi-
tive coping: the intervention provides information about
the relationship between PTSD symptoms and related
problems and encourages participants to use positive
coping strategies to help them feel better and more able
to achieve their goals.
Randomized pilot feasibility trial design
This study uses a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation design [ 81] to conduct a randomized pilot
feasibility trial ( n= 40). The goal of the study is to assess
trial procedures, refine the intervention and its implemen-
tation, and explore effectiveness and implementation out-
comes. See Fig. 1for steps of the study design.
Quantitative assessments
We will gather preliminary data on demographics and
SMI symptoms, effectiveness outcomes including change
in hypothesized treatment mechanisms, and change in
symptoms and functional impairment.
Demographics and SMI symptoms
SMI symptoms
A psychiatric nurse will rate SMI symptom severity
using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Expanded Ver-
sion 4.0 (BPRS-4.0) [ 73].
Clinical diagnosis and characteristics
Health providers will be asked to complete a short form
about participant diagnosis, medication name, dose, and
frequency as well as whether the participant has been
adherent to medication during the last 3 months. Par-
ticipant psychiatric diagnoses, medication, dates of
attended mental health visits during the year prior to the
baseline assessment and up through the 3-month follow-
up, and length of psychiatric illness will be extracted
from medical records at the health center.
Treatment mechanisms
PTSD knowledge
Accurate knowledge about PTSD will be assessed using
an adapted version of the PTSD Knowledge Test which
has been used previously to assess change in PTSD
knowledge after the BREATHE intervention [ 66]. The
adapted PTSD Knowledge Test is a 14-item true/false
and multiple-choice test that assesses information about
trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, associated problems,
and treatment outcomes.Nget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 6 of 15
Mental illness-related stigma
Mental illness-related stigma will be measured by the
10-item version of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Ill-
ness Scale (ISMI-10) [ 82], which has been validated in
Ethiopia [ 49,83].
Post-trauma-related cognitions
Trauma-related cognitions will be assessed by the Post-
Traumatic Cognitions Inventory [ 84] which is a 36-item
measure assessing negative and inaccurate thoughts that
are common in people with PTSD.
Self-reported arousal
The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) will be used to as-
sess three domains of present-moment affective state:
valence (e.g., positive or negative), arousal (e.g., calm or
excited), and dominance (e.g., powerful or weak). Each
affective domain is rated by participants on a 5-point
scale using pictures [ 85].
Psychophysiological arousal
If found to be feasible, acceptable, and accurate follow-
ing usability testing, physiological arousal will be mea-
sured by increases in heart rate variability [ 86,87] using
the Empatica E4 wristband wearable device [ 88] and
Mindfield ESense Skin Response system [ 89] during the
PhenX Toolkit ’s trauma challenge assessment [ 90] which
was adapted from Foa & Rothbaum ’s Standardized
Trauma Interview [ 91], in which participants will be
asked to think about and recount details of their trau-
matic experiences. Similar to other trauma assessment
questionnaires and interviews, the PhenX Toolkit ’s
trauma challenge assessment interview asks about a par-
ticipants ’trauma experiences and assesses symptoms,
while also assessing physiological arousal before during
and after discussion of the trauma experiences and
symptoms [ 90,92]. At each assessment time point, data
will be collected for a total of 15 min including 5 min
during baseline, 5 min during the trauma interview, and
5 min during the trauma imagery.
Use of stress management strategies
For participants in the intervention condition, use of
stress management strategies that are taught during the
intervention, including breathing retraining and positive
coping skills, will be assessed by therapists during in-
session homework review, and will be validated by fidel-
ity raters when they review the audio-recorded sessions.
Mental health symptoms and functional impairment
Suicidal ideation
Suicidal ideation will be assessed using the Suicidal Idea-
tion module of the CIDI [ 74].Alcohol misuse
Hazardous alcohol use will be assessed using the Fast
Alcohol Screening Test (FAST) [ 93] adapted to include
conversions for local alcoholic beverages [ 94].
Clinician-rated PTSD symptoms and diagnosis
Psychiatric nurses will interview participants using the
past-month version of the Clinician Administered PTSD
Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Nurses will score partici-
pants to generate an overall symptom severity and clus-
ter ratings. They will also use the score on the CAPS-5
to decide about whether or not participants meet
current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
Self-reported PTSD symptoms
PTSD symptoms in reference t o the initially identified
traumatic event will be assessed using the Ethiopia
adapted version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5
(PCL-5) [ 95].
Functional impairment
Functional impairment will be assessed by the WHO
Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS 2.0) 12
item version, which has been used previously in
Ethiopia [ 96,97].
Depression symptoms
Depression symptoms will be measured by an adapted
version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
[98] which has been adapted for and used in Ethiopia
[99].
Intervention satisfaction Participants and caregivers
will complete satisfaction ratings that have been devel-
oped and validated in Ethiopia [ 47] during their post-
assessment and providers will complete ratings of their
perception of participant satisfaction, after the partici-
pant ’s last treatment session.
Feasibility trial assessment schedule
Quantitative assessments will be conducted by masked
data collectors and psychiatric nurses at baseline, post-
treatment: defined as the same day up to 1 week after
the last session (post), 1-month after treatment comple-
tion (1-month follow-up), and 3-months after treatment
completion (3-month follow-up; see Fig. 1and Table 1).
Intervention and healthcare satisfaction ratings will be
completed by providers and caregivers (with participant
consent) at post-assessment. Qualitative interviews with
participants who will be purposively sampled based on
those who do and do not complete all of the treatment
sessions and those who do and do not have positive
symptom improvement will be conducted during the 1-
month follow-up by a different researcher to preserveNget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 7 of 15
blinding. Participants who do not want to continue ther-
apy sessions may still participate in assessments.
The time from initial contact to each assessment and
each treatment session will be tracked. To allow for sched-
uling flexibility, participants will be able to complete each
assessment up to 1 week before or after the target assess-
ment date, for a total of a 2-week assessment window for
the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, and a 1-week as-
sessment window for the post-assessment.
Since intervention participants may take between 5
weeks to 5 months to complete the intervention, partici-
pants in the TAU condition will be matched by study

pant in the intervention condition, and will completefollow-up dates on the same schedule. Since interview
times may differ by participant, participants will be told
they will complete five sessions and four interviews dur-
ing the study, but will not be told the assessment sched-
ule in advance.
Assessments will take place at the primary care cen-
ter or hospital, unless this is not feasible for partici-
pants. If participants cannot come to the primary care
center for assessments, then the assessments will be
completed in participant ’s homes or another location
of their choice. All intervention and TAU sessions
will take place in the health care center, and all par-
ticipants will continue concomitant medication man-
agement and follow-up care.Table 1 SPIRIT 2013 figure

When participants are initially consented for the trial,
participants will be given a phone number and a 25 Ethi-
opian Birr (ETB) phone card to use to contact re-
searchers about scheduling or questions or if they
experience any adverse events. In addition, they will be
asked how they would like to be contacted in the event
that they have missed a session. Options will include a
phone call or home visit by a researcher or no contact. If
participants select a phone call or home visit, providers
will attempt to contact them three times before dis-
continuing them from the study.
Participation and retention
We will collect data on participant and provider partici-
pation and retention. Participant participation is defined
as the number of eligible participants (i.e., met inclusion
criteria for screening one and two) who agreed to par-
ticipate in the feasibility trial. Participant retention is the
number of participants who were randomized to the
intervention condition who completed intervention ses-
sions one, two, three, four, and/or five, as well as the
number of all participants in the feasibility trial who
completed the post-assessment, 1-month follow-up, and
3-month follow-up. Provider participation includes the
number of providers who agreed to participate out of
the total number who were offered the opportunity to
participate. In addition, we will gather data on the num-
ber of providers trained to deliver the intervention, and
the number who ultimately were rated highly enough on
their clinical skills and knowledge of trauma and PTSD
to be eligible to be providers during the pre-pilot and
pilot. In addition, when participants, caregivers, and staff
are offered or trained in the intervention but decline to
participate, they will be asked to complete a brief
interview assessing reasons for non-participation.
Quantitative data will be entered using REDCap soft-
ware with smartphones and uploaded to a secure
encrypted server. Data will be downloaded to a password
protected and encrypted computers at UCLA facilities
and Ethiopia field site. All paper data files and audio re-
corders will be kept securely stored in a locked file cabi-
net in a locked office at field site. Qualitative data and
audio recordings will be uploaded to secure encrypted
server and downloaded to a password protected and
encrypted computer. Data management reports across
the three following domains will be employed: entered,
verified, and edited. These reports of data records will be
evaluated once a month.
Ongoing supervision will be achieved through weekly
phone calls and at least three times per year annual site
visits, virtual or neighboring site personnel, to provide
training and supervision. Study coordinators will ensure
consistency of procedures, problems/challenges, and
general training issues. For example, will address issuesof data collection, budget, recruitment, data manage-
ment and analysis, and perform training and ongoing
review of the protocol and assessment procedures. Data
will be examined weekly and feedback provided to
research staff to make any corrections in as close to real
time as possible.
Randomization
Starting with the sixth participant enrolled (the first five
participants will be in the pre-pilot), participants will be
randomized to receive the intervention or treatment as
usual (TAU) which includes medication management
and follow-up at the health facilities. There are currently
no other psychotherapies available so TAU was chosen
as the comparator. The sixth to the 50thparticipant (45
participants to be randomized to account for potential
dropout) will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 allocation
using a computer-generated randomization schedule
that will be created by the PI. After screening is
complete, researchers will run a randomization com-
puter program to identify the assigned treatment arm.
Researchers will then record the participant ID number
and treatment arm in the study log and will also record
the participant ’s treatment arm in their medical chart.
Researchers will then notify the health provider of the
participant ’s allocation and the date and time the partici-
pant will start the treatment or TAU. Participants,
research staff, and psychiatric nurses conducting the pre,
post, and follow-up assessment will be masked to the
participant ’s condition.
Quantitative data analyses
With a small sample size, the analyses will be descriptive
and exploratory and will primarily be used to inform a
future fully powered trial. We will calculate descriptive
statistics to assess participation, retention, satisfaction,
and fidelity. We will explore the relationship between
covariates and baseline outcome scores and retention,
satisfaction, and fidelity to identify any characteristics
that might be associated with higher or lower implemen-
tation success. In addition, we will calculate summary
statistics on all treatment mechanisms, mental health
outcomes, and covariates of interest. We will investigate
how scores on the outcome measures listed above
change over time, paying particular attention to change
between baseline and post-intervention scores and com-
parison between the intervention and the TAU groups.
We will conduct bivariate analyses to assess the associ-
ation between covariates and outcomes. Participant and
caregiver reports will be analyzed separately. For con-
tinuous outcomes, we will use mixed-models with the
participant as the random intercept to assess repeated
measures change over time. This approach was selected
because it models all available data regardless of whetherNget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 9 of 15
individuals were missed at some time points. If deemed
necessary, we will employ variable transformation tech-
niques to improve the normality assumption. The ana-
lysis will include all participants who completed the
baseline assessment and at least one treatment session,
effects of outlier data inclusion in analyses will be
assessed, and if necessary missing data will be handled
using multiple imputation. Given the aim of the study to
assess feasibility and implementation and the low sample
size, differences in comorbidities will not be a main
focus of analysis. Future larger iterations of the protocol
will take these into account.
Qualitative interviews
To understand participant and provider experiences with
the intervention and to identify and explain positive or
negative treatment mechanisms or effects, we will con-
duct semi-structured interviews with all of the partici-
pants enrolled in the pre-pilot ( n= 5), a purposive
sample of half of the participants enrolled in the treat-
ment arm of the feasibility trial ( n= 13), and one inter-
view with each primary health care providers who
administered the intervention and their supervisors. The
primary questions of interest are as follows: (1) what are
the facilitators and barriers to delivering and sustaining
the intervention and (2) how could the intervention be
modified to improve acceptability, implementation, and
sustainability? Interviews with participants will take
place during the 1-month follow-up assessments, after
the quantitative questionnaire. Participants will be pur-
posively sampled to have approximately equal numbers
of men and women, and to have equal numbers of par-
ticipants who did well in the treatment and who did not
do as well (based on satisfaction ratings and outcome
measures completed during the post-assessment). In
addition, we will purposively sample participants who
dropped out of the treatment.
Interviews with healthcare providers and supervisors
will occur after they have finished seeing their last par-
ticipant. Questions of interest include experiences with
the intervention and aspects of study design including
randomization, logistical or other challenges with imple-
mentation, and emotional or behavioral changes during
and after the intervention. In addition, we will ask par-
ticipants for feedback on the feasibility and time burden
of the assessments, audio recordings, screening, and
other aspects of the research trial protocol. The inter-
view guides include open-ended questions to facilitate
inductive analyses and more specific probes related to a
priori research questions.
All interviews and assessments will be conducted by
trained researchers with experience interviewing partici-
pants with SMI, their caregivers, and community mem-
bers. We will also conduct additional training onqualitative interviewing, study protocols and interview
guides, and questions or concerns that might arise when
asking about trauma or PTSD. Audio-recorded inter-
views will be transcribed and translated verbatim from
Amharic into English. Each week, we will review the
transcripts with the interviewers to discuss emerging
themes, modify the interview guide as needed, and assess
theoretical saturation.
Qualitative data analytic plan
Analysis will be iterative and follow descriptive qualita-
tive thematic content analysis [ 100,101]. We will use a
“framework analysis ”[102] approach to facilitate ana-
lyses related to the central research questions. Concepts
will be used to develop a codebook consisting of a label,
a definition, and illustrative quotes from the data. We
will review the coded transcripts to determine emerging
themes. Final themes will be agreed upon in consultation
with mentors and research staff. A research staff mem-
ber will also code the transcripts and we will assess
inter-rater reliability. Data will be re-examined in on-
going discussions to allow for further theorizing and
making connections between research questions, coding
categories, and raw data. We will explore links between
emerging themes to guide intervention development and
the implementation approach.
Discussion
Globally, mental and substance use disorders account
for 23% of years lost to disability, making them the
leading cause of disability [ 103]. Areas of the world
experiencing rapid population growth, such as sub-
Saharan Africa, are estimated to have a 130% increase
in the burden of disability due to mental disorders by
2050 [ 104]. In contrast to the massive need, in low-
income countries, the estimated gap between those
who need mental health care and those who receive
it exceeds 90% [ 105–107].
In Ethiopia, more than 1% of the population [ 108] lives
with SMI and 10% have at least one relative with SMI
[109]. People with SMI in Ethiopia experience high rates
of stigma, neglect, chaining and restraint, human rights
abuses, physical and sexual violence, and road traffic ac-
cidents [ 44,49,51,83,109–117] and have been found to
be victims of violence at higher rates than people with-
out SMI [ 117]. Overall, 25% of people with SMI in
Ethiopia die from unnatural causes [ 118]. In the general
population, almost half of rural Ethiopians experienced
major threatening events in the previous 6 months [ 52].
Providing primary health services that address trauma
exposure and subsequent symptoms may reduce the
negative impact of stressful life events and be acceptable
and feasible in a low-resource setting. Indeed, service
users, caregivers, and providers in Ethiopia supportNget al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:149 Page 10 of 15
provision of mental health services in primary care due
to ease of access, lower costs, and reduction in caregiver
burden [ 119], and over 90% of primary health care
workers in Ethiopia believe mental illness is a problem
and want mental health services integrated into their
health facilities [ 45,119]. The Ethiopian government has
made integration of mental health services into primary
care a policy priority [ 39].
The current study uses mixed methods to evaluate the
potential effectiveness and implementation of a psycho-
therapy intervention to treat PTSD in patients with SMI
in Ethiopian primary care clinics.
Although some interventions for PTSD have been
adapted for use in LMICs, trials have excluded people
with SMI [ 53–56]. Likewise, only a handful of psycho-
social intervention studies for SMI have been conducted
in LMICs, none of which assessed PTSD [ 57–60]. Under-
standing whether interventions are feasible and effective
in LMICs has implications for improving access to, and
sustainability of, care, and has been identified as a critical
research need [ 120] and a National Institute of Mental
Health grand challenge in global mental health [ 121].
Moreover, successful implementation of a psychotherapy
intervention in Ethiopian primary care may provide sup-
port and a framework for interventions in high-income
countries, where comorbid PTSD and SMI is still usually
overlooked, and integration of EBIs for comorbid PTSD
and SMI remains minimal [ 10,13,24–32].
One of the central design considerations for this study
was the selection of the BREATHE intervention [ 61,62]
for adaptation and implementation. Although first-line
PTSD treatments such as CPT and PE have the largest
evidence-base for PTSD treatment, trials have generally
excluded people with SMI, and the interventions are
highly intensive, leading to implementation challenges
[122–125]. Since the goal of this study was to develop
an intervention for PTSD symptoms for people with co-
morbid SMI in a low-resource setting with pre-existing
barriers to implementation including no staff with men-
tal health training and very limited time to spend with
patients [ 43,45–47,126], we chose to use the BREATHE
intervention which was developed for people with
comorbid SMI, is brief and relatively simple, and has a
strong theoretical basis and demonstrated effectiveness
that is almost comparable to intensive first-line PTSD
interventions [ 61,127]. Indeed, assessing the feasibility,
effectiveness, and implementation of the BREATHE
intervention in a low-resource primary care setting has
implications for PTSD treatment in the USA, as re-
searchers have called for brief PTSD care models that
can be easily implemented and sustained in real-world
care [ 122].
Since the intervention is being developed for a new
context, we decided to devote most of the researchresources to a comprehensive qualitative and mixed
methods approach to develop an in-depth understanding
of the cultural and contextual factors that would facili-
tate or hinder effective delivery of the intervention rather
than to a fully powered randomized trial to assess effect-
iveness. If the intervention is acceptable to participants
and providers and implementation challenges can be
addressed, we hope to test its effectiveness in a fully-
powered randomized trial in the future.
In addition, we decided to utilize a hybrid
effectiveness-implementation design rather than only fo-
cusing on effectiveness because the lack of available
mental health services in Ethiopia and other low-income
countries necessitates research designs that can rapidly
move interventions from the laboratory to real-world
clinical care. While an effectiveness design would allow
for direct assessment of the intervention effect, the inter-
vention might still not be suitable for the Ethiopian
health care system. We believe that the type 1 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation design [ 81] is the best
model to develop an effective and contextually and cul-
turally appropriate PTSD intervention that can be sus-
tained in Ethiopian primary care.
Finally, for logistical purposes and the fact that health
services are ordinarily offered in Amharic, we have lim-
ited participants to those who are able to complete pro-
cedures in Amharic. Although most people in Sodo and
South Sodo districts are fluent in Amharic, this is not
true of everyone, particularly those with very limited
education. In addition, the first language of the region is
Gurage, and so the intervention may not be as effective
or acceptable if it is delivered in Amharic.
