Abstract
Background: As dietary behaviours developed during early childhood are known to track into adulthood,
interventions that aim to improve child nutrition at a population level are recommended. Whilst early childhood
education and care (ECEC) is a promising setting for interventions targeting children ’s nutrition behaviours, previous
interventions have largely used high intensity, face-to-face approaches, limiting their reach, implementation and
potential impact at a population level. Web-based modalities represent a promising means of supporting the
delivery of childcare-based interventions whilst overcoming challenges of previous approaches; however, the
feasibility of using such modalities to support implementation is largely unknown. As such, this study sought to
collect feasibility and pilot data to inform the design of a web-based intervention together with health promotion
officer support within childcare centres. Child dietary intake will also be assessed to provide an estimate of the
impact of the implementation intervention.
Methods: A superiority cluster randomised controlled trial with repeat cross-sectional data collection employing an
effectiveness-implementation type-II hybrid design will be conducted with childcare centres within the Hunter New
England region of New South Wales, Australia. Type-II hybrid designs provide the opportunity to assess intervention
efficacy whilst piloting the feasibility of the implementation strategies. Centres allocated to the intervention group
will receive access to a web-based program together with health promotion officer support to implement targeted
healthy eating practices to improve child diet in care. A number of outcomes will be assessed to inform the
feasibility to conduct a larger trial, including childcare centre and parent recruitment and consent rates for each
component of data collection, uptake of the implementation strategies, acceptability of the intervention and
implementation strategies, appropriateness of the implementation strategies and the contextual factors influencing
implementation.

Discussion: This study will provide high-quality evidence regarding the potential feasibility of a web-based
intervention and the impact of healthy eating practices on child diet in care. Web-based modalities provide a
promising approach for population-wide implementation support to childcare centres given their potential reach
and consistency with existing infrastructure.

Background
Childhood overweight and obesity increases the risk of
adult obesity and several other chronic diseases, includ-
ing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and specific
cancers [ 1]. Internationally, more than 41 million chil-
dren aged 0 –5 years were classified as overweight or
obese in 2016 [ 1]. Poor dietary behaviours, including a
low intake of fruit and vegetables and a high intake of
energy-dense discretionary food and beverages (those
which are high in sodium, saturated fat and added
sugars), are considered to be primary risk factors for
the development of childhood overweight and obesity
[2]. Current evidence from Australia, the United States
(U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) report that over
90% of pre-school aged children do not consume recom-
mended servings of vegetables, and almost all consume
excessive amounts of discretionary foods [ 3–5]. Although
substantially higher than vegetables, evidence suggests
that an inadequate proportion of children are consuming
the recommended servings of fruit [ 6]. As dietary behav-
iours developed during early childhood are known to track
into adulthood [ 7], interventions that aim to improve child
nutrition at a population level are recommended [ 8].
Early childhood education and care (ECEC) is a
promising setting for interventions targeting children ’s
nutrition behaviours. With at least 80% of children in
countries including Australia and the U.K. attending
formal centre-based childcare (herein referred to as
childcare centres) [ 4,9], including long day care and
preschools, interventions targeting this setting have the
potential to reach a large number of children during a
crucial developmental period. In Australia, children at-
tend care for an average of 21 h per week [ 10], provid-
ing multiple opportunities to reinforce healthy eating
behaviours. Furthermore, as children can consume up
to two thirds of their recommended daily intake whilst
in care [ 11], interventions to improve the healthy eating
environments of childcare centres have the potential to
substantially improve a child ’s overall nutrition intake.
Internationally, sector-sp ecific recommendations for
childcare centres exist [ 12–14] which acknowledge the
potential impact of the childcare centre environment
on influencing children ’s dietary intake. Importantly,two recent scoping reviews summarising findings from
systematic reviews have identified several childcare-
based nutrition practices associated with improved
child diet outcomes. These include the provision of
interactive child educatio n to improve child knowledge
and skills, educator positive role modelling and en-
gaging with parents to target the provision of healthier
foods [ 15,16].
Whilst the implementation of such practices could po-
tentially improve child nutrition, studies show that such
practices are not routinely implemented by childcare
staff [ 17]. A 2016 systematic review of implementation
support strategies in the childcare setting suggests that
comprehensive approaches, addressing multiple barriers
to implementation, may be most effective in improving
centre uptake of evidence-based nutrition interventions
and dietary intake of children in care [ 18]. However,
such approaches are often resource-intensive, relying on
face-to-face training and ongoing support to childcare
centre staff, which pose significant financial constraints
to achieve sustained implementation at scale [ 18].
Web-based modalities may be a promising way of
supporting the implementation of childcare-based in-
terventions whilst overcoming some of the challenges
of previous approaches. As 100% of childcare centres
in Australia have access to and use a computer daily
for reporting requirements [ 19], web-based interven-
tions are likely to have a broader reach compared to
traditional face-to-face modalities [19]. Additionally,
web-based approaches have the potential to be more
cost-effective than traditional approaches by reducing
the burden on resources such as time and staffing
and allowing access to the intervention at a time and
place convenient to staff [ 15]. Further, behavioural
strategies can be embedded within web-based inter-
ventions to deliberately target reported barriers to the
implementation of healthy eating practices [ 20].
To our knowledge, only two randomised controlled
trials (RCT) on the impact of a web-based program in
childcare centres have been published. A pilot imple-
mentation RCT with 31 centres who provided food in
care from within the U.S. assessed the impact of the
web-based Nutrition and Physical Activity in Child CareBarnes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:163 Page 2 of 11
(Go-NAPSACC) program on childcare healthy eating
environments [ 20]. The study assessed improvements in
childcare nutrition environments via childcare centre
director self-report and found that centres who had
received the intervention had improved self-reported
nutrition environment scores [ 20]. Within Australia, one
RCT with 54 centres evaluated the impact of a web-based
menu planning program on centre provision of foods in
accordance with sector dietary guidelines. Whilst the
intervention did not result in a statistically significant in-
crease in dietary guideline compliance, significant im-
provements in the provision and consumption of healthy
foods and a significant decrease in unhealthy healthy foods
were found [ 21,22]. Whilst these studies show promise,
little is known about the feasibility of implementing such
an intervention within Australian childcare centres,
particularly amongst those that are not responsible for
providing food to children.
Given the limited existing evidence base, the primary
objective of this study is to examine via a type-II hybrid
cluster RCT, the potential feasibility of a web-based
intervention together with health promotion officer
support within childcare centres, whilst assessing the
uptake, acceptability and appropriateness of the inter-
vention and implementation strategies, and contextual
factors influencing implementation.
Secondary objectives are to:
1. Examine the potential effects of the implementation
strategy employed in the study on childcare centre
implementation of recommended practices;
2. Assess the effectiveness of the intervention in
increasing child dietary intake of fruit and vegetable
servings, and decreasing child dietary intake of
sodium (milligrams (mg)), saturated fat (grams (g))
and added sugar (grams (g)) in care; and
3. Assess the effectiveness of the intervention in
increasing servings of fruit and vegetables packed
within children ’s lunchboxes.
Methods and analysis
Study design and setting
A superiority cluster RCT with repeat cross-sectional data
collection employing an effectiveness-implementation
type-II hybrid design will be conducted [ 23]. A hybrid
effectiveness-implementation design enables the assess-
ment of the feasibility of the intervention and the potential
effects of an implementation strategy on centre imple-
mentation of healthy eating practices, whilst assessing the
effectiveness of the intervention in improving child dietary
intake of fruit and vegetables [ 24]. The study will take
place in the Hunter New England (HNE) region of the
state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The HNE
region has approximately 422 centre-based childcarecentres, including preschools and long day care, which
typically enrol children aged 0 –6 years for an average 21 h
per week [ 10,25]. The protocol is reported according to
the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Inter-
ventional Trials (SPIRIT) (Additional file 1)[26].
Study population and recruitment
Childcare centres
To be eligible, childcare centres must (1) enrol > 20 chil-
dren per day, (2) have internet access at the centre, (3)
not provide meals or snacks to children (i.e. parents or
caregivers must be required to provide food packed in
lunchboxes), (4) not be currently participating in any
other intervention to improve child healthy eating and/
or physical activity and (5) not be fully compliant with
healthy eating practices targeted by the intervention and
specified in the NSW state obesity prevention program
(i.e.Munch & Move )[27]. Mobile preschool, family day
care centres and centres that do not cater to children
aged 2 –5 years, cater exclusively for children requiring
specialist care, or are run by the Department of Educa-
tion and Communities Centre will be excluded due to
differing operational characteristics.
A list of potentially eligible centre-based childcare cen-
tres located within the HNE region will be provided by
the NSW Ministry of Health [ 28]. Evidence-based recruit-
ment strategies in the childcare setting will be employed
to reduce risk of recruitment bias and maximise centre
participation in the study [ 29–31]. Specifically, one mem-
ber of the research team will coordinate centre recruit-
ment and monitor consent rates [ 32]. A recruitment
package consisting of a study information statement and
consent form will be progressively distributed to poten-
tially eligible centres in random order. Approximately 2
weeks later, a research assistant (RA) will telephone cen-
tres in random order to assess eligibility, review study de-
tails and request consent for study participation. Centres
will continue to be contacted until the required number
have consented. Such recruitment strategies have been
used previously by the research team to obtain consent
rates over 70% [ 33]. The RA will also schedule a 2-day site
visit to complete baseline data collection for consenting
centres. Centre-level information provided by the NSW
Ministry of Health and demographic information collected
during centre recruitment calls will be used to characterise
non-participants and assess the potential for selection bias.
To minimise attrition, centres will be contacted prior to
follow-up data collection to thank them for their partici-
pation and to schedule a date for data collection at a time
convenient to them [ 32,34].
Children
In order for children to be eligible to participate, they
must (1) have prior written consent from a parent orBarnes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:163 Page 3 of 11
guardian, (2) be between the ages of 2 and 5 years and
(3) not have a dietary restriction that requires specialised
tailoring of their diet (e.g. allergies, intellectual or phys-
ical disability).
Approximately 2 weeks prior to data collection,
centres will be asked to distribute parent information
statements and consent forms via electronic methods,
including email and parent communication apps, and
child pigeonholes as part of standard communication
with parents. The dates of the scheduled site visits will
not be disclosed to parents to avoid any changes to par-
ent usual lunchbox packing. Additionally, approximately
1 week prior to the scheduled site visit, and on the day
of the scheduled site visits, two RAs trained in recruit-
ment and data collection procedures will be present at
the childcare centre to request written consent from
parents for child participation in the study.
Randomisation and blinding
Childcare centres will be randomly allocated following a
block randomisation procedure in a 1:1 ratio to either
intervention or control using a computerised random
number function in Microsoft Excel 2013. Due to the
demographic and socioeconomic diversity of the HNE
region, randomisation will be stratified by centres with a
high number of Aboriginal child enrolments (> 10%)
and by centre socioeconomic status (SES), as determined
by Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas categorisation
using centre postcodes [ 35,36]. Randomisation will be
completed following baseline data collection by a statisti-
cian not otherwise involved in the trial. Staff at participat-
ing childcare centres and those delivering the intervention
will be aware of group allocation. Every effort will be made
to keep data collectors and analysts blind to group
allocation. However, there is potential for data collectors
to become aware of group allocation due to the nature of
the intervention (e.g. display of intervention resources
within the centre).
Intervention practices targeted by the web-intervention
The intervention will target nominated supervisors and
staff within childcare centres and support their imple-
mentation of five healthy eating practices. The selection
of the targeted practices is broadly consistent with the
social ecological framework (SEF) which posits that indi-
vidual behaviour can be influenced via factors through
five nested, hierarchical levels (individual, interpersonal,
community, organisation and policy/enabling environ-
ment) [ 37]. Whilst the framework acknowledges that
broader level factors influence behaviour, this intervention
seeks primarily to influence child diet whilst attending
childcare and, as such, primarily targets the individual and
organisational determinants. The selection of the targeted
practices are based on empirical evidence supporting theassociation between these practices and improved child
dietary intake in childcare, or more generally in other set-
tings [ 38,39] as well as recommendations by international,
national and state guidelines [ 13,14,27]
Specifically, childcare centres will be asked to imple-
ment the following targeted healthy eating practices
within the 6-month intervention period:
i.) Supporting families to provide healthier foods
consistent with dietary guidelines: Childcare centres
will be asked to monitor children ’s lunchboxes for
consistency with dietary guidelines on a daily basis
and distribute nutrition-focused messages to
parents that promote the packing of healthy
lunchboxes at least twice during the intervention
period. Messages will offer advice to address
parents ’commonly reported barriers to providing
healthy foods, including overcoming fussy eating,
improving food acceptance, providing healthy foods
on a budget and quick and healthy options [ 36].
ii.) Provision of intentional learning experiences about
healthy eating to children: Childcare centre staff
will be asked to provide children with intentional
learning experiences at least twice per week aimed
to support children ’s development of healthy eating
behaviours [ 40]. Intentional learning experiences
include, but not limited to, tasting sessions with
new food, planting seeds within a vegetable garden
and reading books about healthy foods.
iii.) Use of feeding practices that support children ’s
healthy eating: Childcare centre staff will be asked
to provide positive reinforcement and
encouragement to children to promote healthy
eating and trying new foods at every meal and
snack occasion. They will also be asked to model
healthy food and drink choices at every meal,
provide positive comments about healthy foods
within children ’s lunchboxes and avoid the use
of food incentives to encourage desired behaviour
[14,15,41].
iv.) Staff participation in professional development in
healthy eating: Childcare centres will be asked to
have at least 50% of staff take part in online training
opportunities targeting staff healthy behaviours and
practices in the centre [ 27,42]. This training
contains videos, interactive activities and reflective
practice questions that will provide educators with
the knowledge, skills and resources to embed
healthy eating into their centre.
v.) Having a comprehensive written nutrition policy
that outlines key healthy eating practices: Childcare
centres will be asked to develop or modify their
existing nutrition policy to ensure the centre has
strategies, procedures and guidelines to enforce theBarnes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:163 Page 4 of 11
implementation of healthy eating practices to
improve child diet [ 43]. Childcare centres will be
asked to include the following elements within the
policy: strategies are in place to ensure staff
monitor children ’s lunchboxes daily for alignment
with dietary guidelines, communication with
families regarding foods packed within lunchboxes
at least twice every 6 months, scheduling and
delivery of intentional nutritional learning
experiences at least twice per week, staff role
modelling positive feeding practices at every meal
and snack time to support children ’s healthy eating
and at least 50% of staff participate in professional
development in healthy eating.
Implementation
The Behavioural Change Wheel (BCW) [ 44] was used to
identify specific components within the web-based pro-
gram as well as other implementation support strategies
that could be employed to support childcare staff to
change their behaviour or their organisation to create
supportive environments for child healthy eating, and
therefore, potentially improve child diet intake in care
[44]. Specifically, barriers and enablers to childcare staff
behaviour change were identified through a systematic
review of the literature [ 17,45–48] and consultation
with stakeholders, including childcare centre staff
and health promotion officers (HPO) with experienceworking within the setting. The BCW process out-
lined by Michie et al. was then followed to categorise
these barriers and enablers using the COM-B model
as either capability, motivation or opportunity [ 44]. A
summary of this process, in cluding the behavioural
change techniques (BCTs) employed within the inter-
vention to address the barriers and enablers, is de-
scribed in Table 1[44]. The implement ation support
strategies, defined according to the Expert Recommen-
dations for Implementing Change (ERIC) taxonomy [ 49],
have been previously used by the research team within
childcare-based interventions and aim to address reported
barriers to intervention implementation whilst being em-
bedded within current infrastructure of the units health
promotion team [ 17,50].
Specifically, the implementation strategies incorporated
into the web-based program, known as Childcare Electronic
Assessment Tool and Support (EATS), include:
Audit and feedback
Childcare EATS includes a self-assessment of the imple-
mentation of targeted healthy eating practices. Following
the completion of the self-assessment, the web-based
program will immediately provide centres with feedback
on practice performance. Childcare centres will be
encouraged to complete the self-assessment at least
twice during the intervention period to self-monitor im-
provements in practice [ 20,33].
Table 1 Determinants of child diet in childcare and strategies to address targeted barriers and enablersBarnes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:163 Page 5 of 11
Develop a formal implementation blueprint
Following the completion of the self-assessment, childcare
centres will be encouraged to use Childcare EATS to set
goals and create an action plan to facilitate improvements
in practice [ 20]. Centres will be encouraged to develop an
action plan at least twice within the intervention period
and continually monitor progress in consultation with
centre staff to assist improvement in practice.
Distribute educational materials
Childcare EATS will house relevant materials developed
through consultation with key stakeholders, including
childcare centre staff, cultural liaisons and health promo-
tion officers with extensive experience working within the
setting. Materials were designed to assist centre ’s adoption
of targeted practices and include factsheets, email mes-
sages and newsletter snippets to facilitate communication
with parents regarding children ’s lunchbox alignment with
guidelines; educational materials to improve staff know-
ledge of providing a positive healthy eating environment;
example activities to demonstrate intentional nutrition
learning experiences within the centre; directions to
online learning opportunities, including webinars and
eLearning modules to support staff professional develop-
ment in nutrition; and nutrition policy templates [ 27].
In addition to web-based resources, childcare centres
allocated to the intervention will receive support from
HPOs within the local health district with experience
working with childcare centres. The implementation
strategies provided through these HPOs will include:
Identify and prepare a centre champion
Upon notification of group allocation, the HPO will ask
centres to identify and prepare a staff member from the
centre who will dedicate themselves to supporting,
marketing and driving implementation of the interven-
tion [ 49,51].
Conduct educational outreach visit
Centre staff (nominated supervisor and centre cham-
pion) will receive one face-to-face training session by an
HPO to support implementation of the healthy eating
practices and introduce the web-based program at the
beginning of the intervention period [ 35]. This will be a
practical, hands-on training session to ensure staff are
comfortable using Childcare EATS, accessing supporting
resources and are aware of the key practices targeted by
the intervention.
Mandate change
Centre nominated supervisors will be asked to show
support for implementing targeted healthy eating prac-
tices via a memorandum of understanding, which will
outline the responsibilities and expected commitmentfrom both the childcare centre and HPO in working to
improve the implementation of healthy eating practices
to improve child dietary intake in care. The memoran-
dum of understanding will be discussed and agreed upon
during the educational outreach visit with centre
supervisors.
Provide ongoing consultation and local technical assistance
Childcare centre staff will be provided with approximately
two telephone calls by an HPO, pending childcare centre
needs, within the intervention period [ 52,53]. Barriers to
centre implementation of healthy eating practices and use
of Childcare EATS will be identified and strategies to
address these barriers will be discussed. Email support will
be provided by HPOs upon request by the centre. An
additional training session delivered by an HPO via online
modalities will be offered to centres, pending centre
needs.
Control group and contamination
Childcare centres allocated to the control group will
receive usual care during the intervention period. Usual
care includes general support from health promotion of-
ficer upon request to implement the state-wide obesity
prevention program [ 27]. Support provided to centres
within the HNE region to implement this state-wide
program is centrally monitored by the research team.
Enhanced support to implement the healthy eating
practices targeted in the intervention will be offered to
control centres after 12-month follow-up data collection
is complete. Assessment of potential contamination will
be collected via a telephone interview with nominated
supervisors and centre champions during follow-up data
collection.
Outcomes
Feasibility of intervention
Feasibility of the intervention, defined as the extent to
which the intervention can be successfully used or
carried out within the childcare setting [ 54] for a fully-
powered implementation trial, will be assessed through
childcare centre and parent recruitment and consent
rates for each component of data collection.
Childcare centre uptake of implementation strategies
Childcare centre use of Childcare EATS will be assessed
through data provided via Google Analytics [ 55]. These
analytics include, but not limited to, total time logged
into the program, completion of the self-assessment and
action plan, most frequently used program features and
the number of requests for assistance. The research team
has previously used these metrics to evaluate childcare
centre adoption of web-based programs [ 21,56]. Internal
records detailing the provision of implementation strategies,Barnes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:163 Page 6 of 11
including the completion, d uration and centre staff in
attendance at the educational outreach visit; type (i.e. tele-
phone, email, online training), frequency and duration of
ongoing support; centre staff signatories on the memoran-
dum of understanding; and selection of a centre champion,
will be maintained by research team members.
Acceptability of implementation strategies and intervention
Supervisors and champions of the childcare centres
randomised to the intervention group will complete a
telephone interview to assess acceptability during follow-
up data collection (6 and 12 months). Acceptability will
be defined as the perception amongst centre staff that
the intervention and implementation strategies are
agreeable, palatable or satisfactory [ 54]. This will be
assess using modified items by Weiner et al. [ 57] and
items previously used by the research team to capture
data on perceived intervention effectiveness, unintended
consequences, reach and adoption and acceptability
(workforce, infrastructure, time requirements) [ 46,58]
and engagement with Childcare EATS [ 59].
Appropriateness of implementation strategies
Appropriateness, defined as the perceived fit, relevance
or compatibility of the intervention and implementation
strategies for the childcare setting [ 54], will be evaluated
through information collected during follow-up telephone
interviews with centre supervisors and champions. The
telephone interviews will include modified items by
Weiner et al. [ 57] and items used by the research team in
previous childcare interventions [ 33].
Implementation context
Relevant constructs within three of the five domains of
the CFIR [ 60] (inner setting (compatibility with centre
values and direction, level of priority). innovation
characteristics (perceived complexity and cost) and
outer setting (external influences such as policies, regula-
tions and peer behaviour)) will be used to identify factors
associated with implementation at follow-up during a tele-
phone interview with childcare supervisors [ 17,60].
Potential effectiveness of the implementation strategy in
improving implementation of targeted healthy eating practices
Childcare centre implementation of the targeted healthy
eating practices (e.g. provision of intentional learning
experiences about healthy eating and staff professional
development in nutrition) and additional data on centre
nutrition environments will be assessed with the Environ-
mental and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO)
tool [ 61]. Per EPAO protocol, a trained RA will undertake
a one-day observation and review of childcare centre
documentation. The EPAO has been previously used by
the research team in 18 childcare centres [ 36] and hasdemonstrated high inter-observer agreement. The tool is
considered to be gold standard for environmental observa-
tions in the childcare setting [ 61]. This will be undertaken
at baseline and follow-up (6 and 12 months).
Secondary effectiveness outcomes
Child dietary intake of fruit and vegetable servings in care
The mean servings of fruits and vegetables from all food
and beverages consumed whilst in care will be assessed
through the measurement of lunchbox foods and bever-
ages across the day. On the days of the site visit, two
trained RAs will assess the lunchboxes of participating
children. Measurement of lunchbox contents will be
conducted on two occasions across the day: prior to the
children ’s first meal time and after the children ’s last
meal time. RAs will remove all contents of the lunchbox
and remove any lids that inhibit the view of contents. A
photo will then be taken of the entire lunchbox contents.
RAs will then weigh each food item included in the
lunchbox, with strict adherence to safe food handling
practices to address occupational health and safety con-
cerns. A written description of the contents will also be
captured to enable accurate recordings where ingredi-
ents may be easily deciphered via photograph, e.g. sand-
wiches and mixed meals. The process of photographing,
weighing and recording lunchbox contents will be re-
peated after the children ’s last meal. Consumption will
be calculated based on foods and beverages present at
the first measurement minus foods remaining at the sec-
ond measurement. Educators will direct children to keep
food wastage, including all partially consumed food and
beverages, within their lunchboxes. All food wastage will
be collected by the research team during the second
measurement and factored into child consumption mea-
surements. The weighed plate method with photographs
has been previously used by the research team [ 36] and
has proven to be a precise measure of dietary intake in
previous studies [ 62]. This weighed food record data will
be entered into a nutrient analysis database (FoodWorks)
[63] by a trained dietitian blinded to centre allocation.
During this process, the dietitian will categorise the food
and beverage items into food groups and calculate mean
servings of fruit and vegetables consumed in accordance
with the serving sizes specified within the Australian
Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) [ 64]. Photographs will
be used to validate written descriptions of foods and the
weights recorded. Lunchbox measurements will be con-
ducted across the two-day site visits at three time points,
baseline and follow-up (6 and 12 months).
Child dietary intake of sodium, saturated fat and added
sugar in care
The nutrient output provided by weighed food record data
entered into the nutrient analysis database (FoodWorks)Barnes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:163 Page 7 of 11
following the process described above will be used to
measure mean sodium (mg), saturated fat (g) and added
sugars (g) from all foods and beverages consumed whilst
in care.
Mean servings of fruit and vegetables packed within
lunchboxes
To determine the impact of the intervention on parent
provision of healthy food in lunchboxes, the mean
servings of fruit and vegetables packed within children ’s
lunchboxes will be assessed via observation and measure-
ment of lunchboxes and lunchbox foods and beverages
following the same process described above.
Centre characteristics
Operational centre characteristics will be assessed at
baseline during a telephone interview with nominated
supervisors. Items within the telephone interview have
been used previously by the research team [ 33], and in-
clude centre type (e.g. preschool, long day care), number
of years in operation, days and hours of operation, post-
code, number of children enrolled and attending, num-
ber of staff employed and the number of Aboriginal or
Torres Strait Islander children enrolled at the centre.
Child characteristics
Child characteristics, including gender, age, Aboriginal
and/or Torres Strait Islander origin, days attending care
and parent level of education, will be collected from
parents/guardians when providing written consent to
participate in the study.
Power calculations
As this is a pilot study, a formal sample size calculation
for the primary outcome is not required [ 65]. However,
we estimated the number of centres required as approxi-
mately 25% of the number needed for a fully-powered
implementation trial. Based on consent rates from previ-
ous web-based intervention studies conducted within
the ECEC setting and allowing for a childcare centre
attrition rate at follow-up of 10%, it is estimated recruit-
ment of 22 childcare centres would be sufficient to
provide data to inform feasibility of undertaking the trial
[21]. To assess the impact of the intervention on child
diet, an approximate difference of 0.3 servings of both
fruit and vegetables is considered clinically significant
based on the potential reduction in risk of chronic dis-
ease [ 66,67]. As such, given the 10% childcare centre at-
trition rate at follow up, recruitment of approximately
440 children from 22 childcare centres (20 children per
centre) will enable detection of a mean difference of 0.3
servings in intake of fruit and vegetable servings, with an
alpha of 0.05 and an estimated ICC of 0.1 [ 32], with 80%
power [ 35,68] and a standard deviation of 0.6 servings.Based on unpublished internal data, this number of
participants will allow detection of a clinically meaning-
ful difference of approximately 1.9 g saturated fat, 4.7 g
added sugar and 155 mg sodium [ 69].
Statistical analysis
The primary trial end-point will be the 6-month follow-
up. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe childcare
centre and child characteristics, the feasibility, uptake of
implementation strategies, acceptability and appropriate-
ness of the intervention and determinants of implementa-
tion. At the centre level, to determine the impact of the
intervention on the implementation of healthy eating
practices, scores of the EPAO will be compared between
intervention and control centres at follow-up, adjusting
for baseline, through linear regression analysis. At the
child and centre levels, multiple imputations will be per-
formed as part of a sensitivity analysis for missing follow-
up data as recommended by White et al. [ 70]. At the child
level, mixed linear regression models will be run on all
secondary outcomes, where a group by time interaction
will assess effectiveness of the intervention. All models will
include a random effect for childcare centre to account
for potential clustering effect, as well as fixed effects for
prognostic variables (SES, gender) under an intention to
treat framework. At the child level, subgroup analyses by
centre socioeconomic status and child gender will also be
undertaken to assess whether there was a differential im-
pact of the intervention.
Progression criteria
Data obtained from the trial will inform decisions
regarding progression to a fully powered implementation
trial. Such decisions will be made via majority, from core
members of the research team, including a representa-
tive from a public health service partnering in the
research that intends to adopt the intervention and im-
plementation support strategy if identified as beneficial
[71]. The decision will follow consideration and discus-
sion between the core members of measures of feasibil-
ity, acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention
and implementation strategies utilised in the study, and
measures of the effect of the intervention on child diet-
ary outcomes. Specifically, in order to progress, the team
must deem the intervention, and implementation strat-
egy to be sufficiently acceptable and feasible that it
would likely be adopted by > 25% of childcare centres
that were offered it. Or, that this could reasonably be
expected with adaptations to the intervention or imple-
mentation approach based on steps previously employed
by the research team [ 72]. Measures of implementation
of the recommended practices, together with assessment
of feasibility, uptake, acceptability and appropriateness
will be used to identify opportunities to further strengthenBarnes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:163 Page 8 of 11
its capacity prior to a fully powered implementation trial.
This will enable the identification of implementation strat-
egies and healthy eating policies and practices required to
achieve the greatest outcome in implementation, and
therefore, child diet.
Discussion
Interventions targeting the childcare setting are recom-
mended to improve child dietary intake in care due to
the potential to reach a large number of children during
a crucial developmental period [ 73]. Despite the exist-
ence of evidence-based healthy eating practice recom-
mendations, previous findings on the impact of such
recommendations on child diet in care are mixed [ 16].
Web-based interventions represent a promising modality
to provide population-wide support to childcare centres
given their potential reach and consistency with existing
infrastructure [ 19]. This study will provide important
data to support the conduct of a fully-powered implemen-
tation trial within Australian ECEC settings and inform
the development of future implementation interventions.
