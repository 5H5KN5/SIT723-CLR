RESEARCH
Development, feasibility, and acceptability 
of SPoRT: a dating violence and sexual 
risk prevention intervention for college 
student -athletes

Abstract 
Background Student-athletes are one subgroup of college students in the USA at risk for dating violence and sex -
ual risk behaviors. Despite this, research on student-athletes’ dating behaviors is limited; existing research pertains 
primarily to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I athletes and focuses on male student-
athletes as perpetrators of dating and sexual violence. While some existing programs aim to reduce dating violence 
and promote healthy relationships, these programs are education based, and not tailored to the specific strengths 
and challenges of student-athletes. We therefore designed Supporting Prevention in Relationships for Teams (SPoRT), 
a novel, four-session prevention intervention for Division III student-athletes of all genders to reduce dating violence 
and sexual risk behavior by targeting knowledge and skills identified in pilot research, incorporating psychoeducation 
with techniques from cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, bystander intervention, and normative feedback.
Methods This study represents stage 1 of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stage Model for Behavioral Inter -
vention Development, evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of SPoRT. We describe the development, content, 
and proposed delivery methods for SPoRT and evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the program using 
a mixed-methods approach. Thirty college student-athletes (12 men, 18 women) completed questionnaires and par -
ticipated in focus groups to provide feedback on the program’s length, timing, group size and dynamics, content, 
and suggestions for making the SPoRT prevention intervention more feasible and acceptable.
Results Our recruitment procedures were successful, and participants rated the program as feasible in terms of deliv-
ery methods and logistics. Participants liked that SPoRT was developed based on pilot data collected from student-
athletes, brief, and skills based and tailored to athletic team needs. SPoRT was perceived as appropriate and relevant 
to student-athlete needs in terms of dating violence and sexual risk prevention knowledge and skills. Most partici-
pants (63%) rated the program as “excellent” and said they would recommend it to others.
Conclusions We found SPoRT to be both feasible and acceptable in terms of content and delivery. Suggested 
modifications will be incorporated into the SPoRT healthy relationships prevention intervention to be tested in an NIH 
Stage 1 efficacy trial.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• What uncertainties about feasibility existed prior to 
this study?
 SPoRT is the first data-driven prevention interven -
tion to promote healthy relationships and reduce 
dating violence and sexual risk behaviors among 
NCAA Division III college student-athletes of all 
genders in the USA. Because SPoRT is a novel pro -
gram designed for a unique population, we needed to 
assess student-athletes’ perceptions of the program’s 
content, length, timing, group size, and composition, 
to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the 
prevention intervention before testing its efficacy in a 
randomized control trial. Consistent with the goal of 
designing this tailored prevention intervention with 
input from the community, it was important for us to 
collect qualitative data to assess whether participants 
found the program activities interesting and engag -
ing and what changes they would like to see. An addi -
tional feasibility aim was to pilot our recruitment 
procedures to determine if we could successfully 
recruit student-athletes as participants, given their 
busy schedules.
• What are the key feasibility findings from this study?
 Using a mixed-methods approach, we evaluated 
student-athletes’ satisfaction with and perceptions of 
the proposed delivery methods and program content. 
Key feasibility findings include participants’ willing -
ness to participate in SPoRT, satisfaction and positive 
evaluations of SPoRT’s content, length and timing 
of sessions, and the program being delivered within 
each team. Specific suggestions and modifications 
participants wanted to see in the program included 
more discussion of college hook-up culture and the 
inclusion of multiple activities to practice specific 
skills to reinforce learning. Our success with recruit -
ment in the present study supports the feasibility of 
recruiting student-athletes to participate in a pilot 
randomized controlled trial.
• What are the implications of the feasibility findings 
on the main study’s design?
 These results will inform the next phase of the 
research, following the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) Stage Model of Behavioral Intervention Devel -
opment. Our findings indicate that we can proceed 
with a Stage 1 pilot randomized controlled trial of 
SPoRT with all student-athletes at one National Col -
legiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III 
university, which we will conduct after incorporating 
modifications to the program based on participant 
feedback.Background
Dating violence (DV) can be defined as the victimiza -
tion or perpetration of physical violence, sexual violence, 
threats of physical or sexual violence, stalking, and psy -
chological aggression against a partner in a dating rela -
tionship [1, 2]. A dating relationship includes a variety 
of behaviors, including spending time with a romantic 
interest with the expectation of future interactions, to a 
committed and exclusive partnership. Upwards of 47% 
of women and 38% of men first experience DV between 
the ages of 18 and 24 [1]. Further, DV is more common 
among college-aged couples relative to other age groups 
[3]. Among college students specifically, physical aggres -
sion occurs in 20 to 30% of dating relationships, while 
psychological aggression occurs in 50 to 80% of dating 
relationships, and sexual aggression occurs in 15 to 25% 
of dating relationships [4, 5].
Intercollegiate student-athletes are one group of col -
lege students at high risk for DV in the USA [6, 7]. The 
NCAA has three divisions: Division I athletic programs 
are the most competitive and award the most athletic 
scholarships, Division II programs are less competitive 
and award some scholarships, and Division III programs 
are less competitive than the other divisions and are not 
allowed to award athletic scholarships [8]. However, 40% 
of college student-athletes in the USA compete at the 
Division III level, with 438 college and university pro -
grams [9]. Notably, student-athletes are overrepresented 
as sexual violence perpetrators in judicial affairs com -
plaints as compared to their non-athlete counterparts 
and are more likely to endorse acceptance of violence, 
rape myths, hostility towards women, and sexist beliefs 
than nonathletes [10–13]. Student-athletes also exhibit 
high rates of sexual risk behaviors (SRB), such as alco -
hol use before sex, condomless sex, and multiple sexual 
partners [14], which may lead to health outcomes such as 
unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infec -
tions [6, 11–13, 15–17]. Further, student-athletes report 
hazardous drinking, a known risk factor for DV and SRB 
involvement, with male student-athletes exhibiting high 
rates of alcohol use in conjunction with SRB [14, 18]. 
Specifically, alcohol use is associated with the perpetra -
tion of DV [19–23] among Division III student-athletes 
[14, 24, 25] and increases instances of unprotected sex 
[26].
In the USA, NCAA requires student-athletes to 
engage yearly in education on sexual violence prevention 
(NCAA.org, 2017). However, of the prevention programs 
targeting DV among college student-athletes, most are 
solely education based, and their efficacy has not been 
evaluated. Education, while necessary, is not sufficient 
for positive behavioral change [27] and may be unlikely 
to reduce rates of DV. Such programs include peer-led 
Page 3 of 14
 Jaffe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:183 
 
bystander training [28] and web-based format focused on 
alcohol use [29]. Instead, teaching evidence-based rela -
tionship skills in conjunction with psychoeducation may 
be more likely to elicit positive behavioral change [27]. 
Additionally, interventions are maximally effective when 
targeting unique strengths and challenges of any popula -
tion [30].
Supporting Prevention in Relationships for Teams 
(SPoRT) is a prevention intervention developed to tar -
get the strengths and challenges of NCAA Division III 
student-athletes in establishing and maintaining healthy 
dating relationships. It is an inclusive, targeted, data- and 
skills-driven prevention intervention guided by the Cent -
ers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations 
to the White House Task Force to Protect Students from 
Sexual Violence [27]. The overall goal of SPoRT is to have 
a positive impact on dating and relationship behaviors 
among Division III student-athletes by reducing risk for 
DV, SRB, and alcohol use through targeting several key 
mechanisms for change. These include psychoeducation 
about DV, SRB, alcohol use, and sexism; teaching cogni -
tive-behavioral and mindfulness-based emotion regula -
tion, stress management, and communication skills; and 
harnessing the strengths of the athletics and team envi -
ronment to provide normative feedback and encourage 
bystander behaviors.
Psychoeducation
Psychoeducation on DV in addition to SRB, alcohol, 
and sexism is a necessary start for successful behavioral 
change [27]. In addition, attitudes like hostile sexism and 
rape myth endorsement are associated with DV and SRB. 
This may be the result of sexism motivating perpetration 
or the endorsement of rape myths justifying perpetra -
tion [19, 31]. However, those attitudes are modifiable, 
and psychoeducation about rape myths, consent, and 
sexual risk reduction can reduce DV on college campuses 
[32]. Further, athletes with attitudes supportive of gender 
equity are less likely to report perpetrating DV [33]. Thus, 
these attitudinal risk factors are an important interven -
tion target that may cultivate environments which are 
less conducive to DV and SRB [34].
Emotion regulation and stress management skills
Targeting affective attitudes through emotion regula -
tion and adaptive stress management strategies may 
increase positive outcomes as affective attitudes elicit 
behavioral change [35]. Further, emotion dysregulation is 
associated with maladaptive behaviors, such as alcohol-
involved violence [36]. One stress management strategy 
commonly associated with emotion regulation is mind -
fulness. As an adaptive stress management strategy, 
mindfulness reduces stress [37, 38]. Specifically, among athletes, several facets of mindfulness, such as acting 
with awareness and non-judgement, are associated with 
stress reduction [39]. Mindfulness may also affect SRB, 
because it is associated with sexual consciousness and 
motivation [40].
Over the last decade, mindfulness-based interventions 
have also been designed to treat addictive behaviors, such 
as alcohol use [41]. Specifically, awareness of and reac -
tions to aversive cognitive, affective, or physical states 
(i.e., cravings) are targeted through mindfulness-based 
interventions [42]. These include mindfulness-based 
relapse prevention [43, 44] and mindfulness-based sub -
stance abuse treatment for adolescents [45]. As such, it 
is reasonable to suggest that mindfulness may also help 
reduce alcohol use among college student-athletes.
Communication skills
Another key mechanism for change includes increasing 
assertive communication skills. Dating partners can be 
taught to communicate effectively in order to establish 
and maintain healthy relationships. Assertive communi -
cation, which involves firm and direct verbal and nonver -
bal communication of one’s feelings, beliefs, and desires, 
may improve relationship quality and result in a reduc -
tion of SRB. Historically, intervention participants have 
been taught assertive communication to express a desire 
for safer sex behaviors [46, 47]. Interventions including 
a communication component have proven efficacious, 
resulting in more positive communication between dat -
ing partners [48, 49] and less DV [50]. Further, commu -
nication among college couples can increase safe sex 
behaviors, such as condom use [51, 52].
Bystander behaviors
Bystander interventions can increase knowledge about 
DV and simultaneously lead to decreases in attitudes con -
doning of violent behaviors [53]. The intent of bystander 
interventions is to improve the decision-making pro -
cess, during which bystanders notice a situation, address 
it, assess their own skills, and choose to intervene [54]. 
Among high school athletes, intention to intervene as a 
bystander is associated with less DV perpetration [33]. 
In addition, bystander interventions appear to reduce 
attitudinal risk over standard DV awareness education 
programs among college samples [55, 56]. Bystander 
interventions have also had a positive effect on attitudes 
towards DV, willingness to help, and other bystander 
behaviors [57–60]. Student-athletes often serve as leaders 
on campus and are in a unique position to address dan -
gerous situations that may result in DV or SRB and inter -
vene with their teammates and classmates.

Normative feedback
Normative feedback corrects atypical assumptions influ -
encing behaviors [61]. Providing normative feedback may 
decrease SRB, as young adults’ perceptions of their peers’ 
sexual activity, both frequency and quantity of part -
ners, can be positively skewed; among student-athletes, 
unhealthy sexual behaviors are overestimated, leading to 
a false consensus effect [62]. The delivery of team-spe -
cific data can aid in the reduction of other SRBs, such as 
number of sex partners, frequency of sexual activity, and 
engaging safe sex behaviors prior to the onset of sexual 
activity. Normative feedback can also change perceived 
norms and reduce drinking behaviors among college stu -
dents [61]. Further, online interventions for student-ath -
letes utilizing normative feedback increase knowledge on 
DV behaviors and rape supportive beliefs [29]. As such, 
interventions should prioritize team-specific data-driven 
discussions in addition to evidence-based skills.
The current study
Both phases 1 and 2 of this study represent Stage 1 of the 
NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Develop -
ment [63]. Stage 1 includes modification to improve both 
the training materials and implementation of the new or 
revised intervention [64]. By adhering to the stage model 
of intervention development, we recognize that the sci -
entific study of behavioral interventions neither begins 
nor ends with randomized control trials (RCTs). Instead, 
development begins with manual development (phase 1) 
and feasibility testing (phase 2).
The current study describes the development of the 
SPoRT prevention intervention manual and initial evalu -
ation of the feasibility and acceptability of SPoRT. All 
study procedures were approved by the university’s 
institutional review board. The aims of a feasibility and 
acceptability study, as defined by the stage model, include 
demonstrating (a) participant acceptance of the new 
intervention, (b) the investigators’ ability to recruit from 
the target population, and (c) feasibility of intervention 
delivery [64]. This approach can be used to determine 
what aspects of the research methods and/or interven -
tion protocol require modification [65]. Specifically, an 
evaluation of feasibility and acceptability is required in 
order to determine student-athletes’ satisfaction with the 
content and preferences for program delivery.
Hypothesis
SPoRT differs from existing prevention interventions 
aimed to reduce DV and SRB because it is data-driven 
and targeted to the specific needs and strengths of 
NCAA Division III student-athletes. Further, develop -
mental research with student-athletes informed SPoRT’s 
recruitment procedures, content, and delivery in order to increase feasibility. We developed SPoRT based on 
student-athletes’ needs and preferences to facilitate 
acceptability of the prevention intervention. As such, we 
predicted that NCAA Division III student-athletes would 
find SPoRT both feasible and acceptable.
Methods
Phase 1: SPoRT development
The intervention modules in SPoRT consist of psychoe -
ducation about DV, SRB, and alcohol use risk reduction. 
challenging sexist attitudes and rape myths, and teach -
ing brief emotion regulation, stress management, and 
communication skills [27, 57, 66–70]. Previous mixed-
methods data collected from Division III student-ath -
letes informed the inclusive development of SPoRT [24], 
accounting for diversity of gender and sexual orientation 
in addition to relationship experiences.
First, we conducted a survey of all student-athletes at 
the target Division III university. Quantitative data were 
collected from a sample of 350 Division III student-ath -
letes (53.1% male, 45.4% female, 0.9% preferred not to 
say, 0.6% did not answer) from 16 sports teams (7 male 
teams and 9 female teams). These teams included foot -
ball, men’s and women’s track and field, field hockey, 
men’s and women’s soccer, men’s and women’s swimming 
and diving, men’s and women’s cross country, baseball, 
men’s and women’s basketball, volleyball, softball, and 
women’s lacrosse. For a review of the quantitative data 
collected, see Table1.
Next, we conducted focus groups to inform specific 
components of intervention delivery, such as when dur -
ing the athletic season the intervention should take place, 
facilitator preferences, and size of intervention groups. 
Analysis of this data was guided by a consensual quali -
tative research (CQR) approach [71]. For a summary of 
core ideas, see Table  1. Both the qualitative and quanti -
tative findings from the intervention development phase 
were used to inform the final SPoRT intervention manual 
used in this feasibility and acceptability study.
SPoRT content and delivery
The four 75-min SPoRT sessions addressed the follow -
ing topics: (1) taking care of yourself and your team, (2) 
healthy relationships, (3) sexual violence, and (4) sexual 
risk. Each session was rehearsed first with research assis -
tants to confirm the timing for each module within the 
session. See Table  2 for an outline of the content areas of 
each intervention module.
SPoRT is designed to be delivered to one athletic 
team at a time, co-facilitated by a trained mental health 
clinician working with a student team leader, who is 
identified in consultation with team coaches and ath -
letic staff. Evidence-based techniques facilitate group

discussions and skills delivery. Normative feedback is 
derived from a baseline survey administered to teach 
team prior to session 1. Co-facilitators use a motiva -
tional interviewing approach [72] to deliver team-
specific normative feedback data to build motivation 
for change. Cognitive-behavioral techniques [73] are 
used to teach, model, and reinforce skills. Addition -
ally, mindfulness-based relaxation strategies are intro -
duced to assist in targeting multiple key mechanisms 
for change by improving emotion regulation, reducing 
stress, increasing sexual awareness, and reducing rates 
of alcohol use.
Phase 2: feasibility and acceptability of SPoRT
Participants
Eligible participants included intercollegiate student-
athletes enrolled in a public NCAA Division III uni -
versity in the northeastern USA with an undergraduate 
student population of approximately 15,000. All inter -
collegiate student-athletes over the age of 18 were eli -
gible for participation and were randomly identified 
from team rosters and recruited via email. Of the 422 
student-athletes invited, 71 responded. Of those who 
responded, 52 expressed interest in participating, 10 
stated that they were not interested in participating, 
and 9 were lost to follow-up after requesting to learn 
more. An additional 22 were lost to follow-up after 
scheduling and failing to attend or expressing interest 
and failing to sign up for an available group. In total, 
30 student-athletes participated in the focus groups: 
12 male-identified and 18 female-identified. Of note, 
this response rate is consistent with student-athlete’s 
statements regarding their availability. For more infor -
mation, please see intervention timing section of feasi -
bility results.Procedure
This study was approved by university’s institutional 
review board. Focus groups were held virtually via Webex 
video, and separated by gender, with male (N = 12) and 
female (N = 18) student-athletes. Groups were recorded, 
and student-athletes were prompted to not use any iden -
tifying information once the recording device was turned 
on. Any identifying information was removed during the 
transcription phase. Participants were compensated with 
US $20. The focus group facilitator (the first author) was 
a female doctoral student in clinical psychology with 
experience leading groups and 4 years of clinical training.
During the focus groups, the facilitator introduced each 
of SPoRT’s four sessions and provided an example of the 
intervention techniques to facilitate experiences. When 
reviewing the first session, taking care of yourself and 
your team, student-athletes discussed emotion regulation 
strategies and were taught mindfulness-based relaxa -
tion strategies through in  vivo practice and encouraged 
to download a United States Veteran’s Affairs-sponsored 
mindfulness phone application. For the second session, 
healthy relationships, student-athletes learned the defi -
nition of DV, subsequently engaged in a DV activity, and 
learned assertive communication skills. When reviewing 
the third session, sexual violence, student-athletes dis -
cussed consent and watched a popular video explaining 
consent through sport metaphors. For the fourth session, 
sexual risk, student-athletes learned about SRB, reviewed 
a condom race activity, the impact of alcohol-use on SRB, 
and discussed a handout on SRB.
Following this presentation on some of the content, 
activities, and handouts included in SPoRT, student-
athletes engaged in a semi-structured, guided discussion 
about their opinions on the acceptability and feasibility of 
the materials that were presented [74]. The focus group 
guide contained questions concerning (a) participant’s Table 2 SPoRT intervention modules

overall thoughts towards SPoRT, specifically what they 
liked and disliked; (b) preferences towards and appro -
priateness of interactive activities; (c) perception of the 
purpose of SPoRT and the ability to identify overarching 
domains and core ideas throughout intervention deliv -
ery; (d) specific skills embedded within the intervention; 
(e) what additional content should be included or sub -
sequently, excluded from SPoRT; (f) acceptability of the 
discussions concerning difficult topics; and (g) when in 
their season student-athletes would like to receive SPoRT 
in addition to preferred length of the sessions. Follow-up 
probing questions were used to elicit complete, detailed 
responses, and after the guided discussion, a brief ques -
tionnaire was completed.
Quantitative approach
Measures  The feasibility and acceptability question -
naire contained 13 items. The items included were 
informed from a previous study examining the feasibil -
ity and acceptability of a DV and sexual risk intervention 
[75]. The first item concerns student-athletes’ willingness 
to discuss the topics presented in SPoRT, with student-
athletes required to indicate whether they are willing to 
discuss these topics or not. Participants were then asked 
to describe their reasoning as to why they would or 
would not participate in SPoRT.
Student-athletes were then presented with seven Likert 
scale items asking about the acceptability of discussing 
their experiences or their teammates’ experiences with 
DV, safe sex behaviors such as condom use and dis -
cussing STIs, consent, dating relationships, and sexual 
encounters. Student-athletes were asked to indicate if it 
is very easy (1), easy (2), neutral (3), hard (4), or very hard 
(5) to address these topics. Two additional open-ended 
items queried whether there are any topics included in 
SPoRT that the athletes would like to see removed and 
if there were any topics athletes would like to see added.
Client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ) The CSQ [76] 
is an eight-item self-report measure of participant satis -
faction. Designed to evaluate human service programs, 
the CSQ allows participants the opportunity to evaluate 
the services provided to them. We adapted the language 
of certain items in the CSQ to reflect the current study 
(i.e., replacing “program” and “service” with “interven -
tion”). Each item contains four answer options, ranging 
in degree of satisfaction with the service or intervention 
received. For example, some answer options range from 
“almost all of my needs have been met” to “none of my 
needs have been met. ” Scores of three or above reflect a 
positive evaluation, while scores of two or below reflect a negative evaluation. For example, answer options include 
the following: 4 = very satisfied, 3 = mostly satisfied, 
2 = indifferent or mildly dissatisfied, and 1 = quite dis -
satisfied. The CSQ has strong internal consistency, with 
a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 [76]. For the current study, 
the CSQ demonstrated strong internal consistency, with 
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86.
Qualitative approach We transcribed focus group data 
via otter.ai and converted the transcripts into word pro -
cessing documents. A research assistant reviewed these 
transcripts for fidelity, comparing them with the original 
focus group recordings. All identifying information was 
removed during this process. Coding was guided by a 
consensual qualitative research (CQR) approach, which 
allows for data to be collected through open-ended ques -
tions and consists of several coders throughout the analy -
sis phase in order to foster multiple perspectives before a 
consensus is reached concerning the meaning of the data 
[77]. The research team, comprised of an auditor (the 
first author) and two undergraduate research assistants 
as coders, created a coding manual based on preliminary 
analysis of the transcripts and memos. Of note, coding 
focused on the primary constructs of interest: feasibility 
and acceptability. As such, while the NIH Stage Model for 
Behavioral Intervention Development framework guided 
the focus group agenda, an iterative process consist -
ent with CQR guided data analysis. Research assistants 
entered transcript codes into spreadsheets. The coding 
manual was organized into domains, core ideas, catego -
ries, and sub-categories. This methodology is consistent 
with the three general steps of CQR, which are (1) divide 
data into domains, (2) construct core ideas within each 
domain, and (3) cross analyze the data to develop catego -
ries consistent with the core ideas within domains (71). 
The auditor reconciled disagreements across research 
assistants and cross-checked the research assistants’ cod -
ing with the transcripts.
Results
Quantitative results
Participants were encouraged to complete the CSQ given 
their knowledge of SPoRT following the overview of ses -
sions and presentation on some of the content, activities, 
and handouts included in SPoRT. Participants expressed 
general satisfaction with SPoRT, with an average total 
score of 28 (N = 25, SD = 3) out of 32 on the CSQ, with 
higher scores expressing greater satisfaction. All eight 
items received mean scores of three or above, reflecting 
general satisfaction with SPoRT. Three items received 
scores of two or below, reflecting indifference or mild dis -
satisfaction. These findings are summarized in Table 3.

In terms of intervention delivery, the majority (62%, 
N = 18) of participants noted a preference for receiving 
SPoRT across 4 weeks, with four 1-h and 15-min sessions 
occurring in the evenings. The majority of students (55%, 
N = 16) also indicated a preference for engaging in SPoRT 
during their freshman year. When asked about prefer -
ences towards the format of the activities embedded 
within SPoRT, 76% (N = 22) of participants identified a 
preference for games over videos (27.6%, N = 8), role-play 
activities (31%, N = 9), or audio recordings (3%, N = 10).
Qualitative results
Following a CQR approach, domains and associated core 
ideas, categories, and sub-categories were developed and 
organized into a coding manual. Frequencies were not 
included as percentages, as CQR encourages utilizing 
labels to describe frequency. These labels include gen -
eral, typical, and variant. “General” reflects a core idea, 
category, or sub-category included in all or all but one of the focus groups. “Typical” reflects a core idea, cate -
gory, or sub-category included in more than half of the 
focus groups but less than all but one of the focus groups. 
“Variant” reflects a core idea, category, or sub-category 
included in at least two of the focus groups to the cutoff  
for typical. The label rare is used when a code idea, cate -
gory, or sub-category is only included in one focus group.
Feasibility
Core ideas concerning the feasibility of SPoRT included 
intervention length, intervention timing, and interven -
tion group size. Within intervention length, length of 
sessions and number of sessions were included as catego -
ries, with attention and module length as sub-categories. 
Within intervention timing, categories included when 
in the year, time of day, day of the week, and individual 
schedules. Sub-categories for when in the year included 
preseason or camp, in-season, or out of season; sub-cate -
gories for time of day included mornings, afternoons, or Table 3 Overview of client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ)

evenings; and sub-categories for day of the week included 
weekdays or weekends. Within intervention group size, 
categories included small groups. Sub-categories for 
small groups included accessibility and comfortability. 
Those categories and sub-categories are described below, 
with examples.
Intervention length
Student-athletes noted that they found the interven -
tion length, including length of sessions, and number of 
sessions, not only feasible but also a strength of SPoRT. 
Given the amount of content included and amount of 
time allotted between sessions (6  days, one session a 
week), four 1-h and 15-min sessions were deemed appro -
priate and according to one male student-athlete “very 
digestible. ” Similarly, female student-athletes commented 
on the benefits of both the amount of and length of 
sessions:
I think it is also the fact that it’s over multiple days 
it’s not like the same time all at once is great because 
I think it’s creating a long-term narrative versus just 
I am here to sit here for 3 hours and have to just pay 
attention and then I leave.
Further, student-athletes also acknowledged that this 
structure allows for students to remain engaged in the 
content. Such a format also increases comfort with dis -
closure. For example, a male student-athlete noted the 
following:
Okay, so I think just being there four days, one day 
a week, I think it would build a bond between the 
team, especially with the same, the same people 
within the group.
When asked about the time allotted for activities and 
discussions, student-athletes responded positively. A 
female student-athlete stated the following:
I liked them, I felt like they were not over strenuous 
or invasive or overly time consuming. It really drove 
the points.
Intervention timing
When presented options for the timing of the interven -
tion, student-athletes expressed a preference for either 
preseason or during the beginning of the athletic sea -
son. For example, a male student-athlete expressed the 
following:
Definitely preseason. When you are getting accli -
mated. If it is at a time when you are getting reac -
climated, if something like this comes along, it can be 
very beneficial.Participants also noted time constraints related to 
off-campus athletic competitions. In addition, they 
highlighted the need to consider first-year students, 
by making sure they receive the information included 
in SPoRT before becoming accustomed to the college 
atmosphere. Another male student-athlete stated the 
following:
I also think preseason for my group just because 
that’s when all the freshmen start to come in and you 
got to like, I guess, bring the message out early before 
seasons start so that it’s there.
Other preferences included engaging in SPoRT in the 
evenings during the week, as there are fewer classes in 
the evening, and the weekends are often reserved for 
competitions and other commitments. A female student-
athlete noted her preference for the evening: “probably 
the evening because, like, a student-athlete schedule is 
packed. ” Some student-athletes recommended replac -
ing a practice session with SPoRT, as doing so would 
strengthen motivation to participate in SPoRT. One male 
student-athlete described the following:
I think if you can get into, like ending practice early 
and having a meeting people will be more inclined 
to pay attention, because I know whenever we have 
meetings after practice and we have just work our 
asses off and have work to do or meetings for club no 
one really wants to go into something they just see as 
mandatory session. 
Across focus groups, student-athletes shared a pref -
erence for replacing or augmenting practice time with 
SPoRT due to their busy schedules.
Intervention group size
Smaller group sizes of up to eight to ten student-athletes 
provided student-athletes with an increased sense of 
comfort when discussing difficult topics, such as STIs 
and DV.
It’s very small and since we are doing it with the 
same group each week, I feel like it’d be more com -
fortable environment to speak in. 
Not only does a small group size foster a safe environ -
ment but it also contributes to an active learning envi -
ronment where student-athletes can share their thoughts 
and experiences.
I just like the smaller better because it’s more in 
depth and I think creates a better environment and 
a better… speaking environment and trust within 
people as opposed to that one it’s like here’s some -
thing we have to do and we’re just going to get it over 
Page 10 of 14 Jaffe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:183 
with. 
Taken together, small group sizes were identified as a 
strength of SPoRT and the preferred format across focus 
groups.
Acceptability
Core ideas related to the acceptability of SPoRT were 
group dynamics, intervention content, retention of 
intervention content, content to keep, suggested con -
tent, and content requiring modification. Categories 
embedded within group dynamics included gender, age 
and academic year, facilitators, and interaction styles. 
Sub-categories included cliques, taking the intervention 
seriously, planting seeds, and utilizing senior team lead -
ers. Within intervention content, categories included 
the following: relatability, activities, interactive modules, 
discussion-based modules, gender-inclusive content, 
depth of content, healthy relationships, hook-up culture, 
and emotion regulation. Sub-categories of relatability 
specifically included talking to students and to student-
athletes. Finally, categories of retention of intervention 
content included holding onto information and applying 
the information.
Group dynamics
Group dynamics were most prominently discussed in 
terms of age and academic year, in addition to interaction 
styles. Student-athletes noted a preference for diversity 
among SPoRT group members as it pertains to academic 
year in order to assist those younger team members, 
particularly freshmen, feel comfortable with their fellow 
team members. One female student-athletes explained as 
follows:
Maybe breaking senior cliques and freshman cliques 
and mixing them grade wise will help because peo -
ple who are more mature about handling and open -
ing up a little more than maybe like a freshman 
who’s maybe a little more immature. 
Other group dynamics included interaction styles, 
which speaks to how group members feel most com -
fortable interacting with one another. For example, par -
ticipants acknowledged that some group members may 
prefer interactive content and competition-based activi -
ties, while others may prefer watching videos and listen -
ing to discussions. As such, one male student-athlete 
suggested the following:
One idea for it maybe is have one, at the beginning, 
people might not be as comfortable with the other 
people there. So I mean a little bit less still interac -
tive, but like a little bit less person to person until 
they get more comfortable. And later on, you could do ones that are more interactive with more of the 
people once they are more comfortable.
Student-athletes also described strategies that could 
help improve engagement in the group and session 
material. One such strategy includes involving a stu -
dent team-leader as a co-facilitator, which participants 
found appealing. One male student-athlete explained 
several benefits for including student team leader as a 
co-facilitator:
I think having a team leader saying that guys let’s 
take this seriously will help to reinforce that because 
I think if it was just someone in an outside source 
trying to facilitate this it would not be taken seri -
ously.
Intervention content
This category and its related sub-categories refer to stu -
dent-athletes’ preference for specific modules and the 
content embedded within those modules. For example, 
content perceived favorably by student-athletes was rel -
evant to student-athletes and their non-athlete coun -
terparts. Other such preferences included interactive 
content (i.e., active discussions and competition-based 
activities), in-depth discussions, and information that 
is gender-inclusive in its presentation. For example, a 
male student-athlete spoke specifically to the activities 
included within SPoRT:
I like the activities. They were interactive. And that’s 
one thing I feel like with an activity we have to make 
it interactive. The less we have people pitch in the 
less they are gonna pay attention.
I think a lot of athletes learn from hands-on doing 
things. If you are using athletes, these are people who 
use their hands use their eye-hand coordination. 
They learn by doing most of the time.
This is in contrast to other interventions, which focus 
on lecture-based learning. The interactivity of SPoRT 
appeared appealing to student-athletes, as it increases 
participant’s attention and possibly engagement in the 
session material.
Consistent across focus groups, student-athletes dis -
cussed their enjoyment of the mindfulness exercise 
included in SPoRT. They also highlighted the benefits of 
the content on emotion regulation. A male student-ath -
lete stated the following:
My personal favorite is just the breathing and emo -
tional exercises. Sometimes when I am anxious it’s 
something I forget to do. I forget to stop and decom -
press. So, I just like taking a step back.
Page 11 of 14
 Jaffe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:183 
 
Two female student-athletes agreed, acknowledging the 
following:
I really like how the program started off, like when 
we talked about emotional management and 
detaching yourself from emotion and knowing that 
you are not your emotions.
The first one talked about mindfulness and more of 
your own emotions and regulating your emotions 
and that was not something I quite expected to be 
in it but I think it really important and is not talked 
about enough.
Other student-athletes identified the benefits of includ -
ing additional content on hook-up culture and casual 
sexual relationships. A female student-athlete said:
I think maybe there should be a small section about 
hookup culture. Especially, college students see that 
a lot and like they might not know how to feel with 
it or go into it or feel pressured to go into something 
they are not comfortable with. But I think hookup 
culture is a big thing with college students. 
As such, student-athletes spoke both of the content 
they identified as crucial to the goal of SPoRT—to teach 
student-athletes about healthy relationships—and con -
tent that is not yet included in SPoRT that may assist 
student-athletes in establishing and maintaining healthy 
relationships.
Retention
Student-athletes consistently noted the benefits of receiv -
ing and reviewing information primed for retention and 
able to be applied in everyday situations. For example, a 
male student-athlete described SPoRT as something “I 
wanted to pay attention because I felt it would be very 
useful for me to like, understand and know more about 
it. ” Another benefit of SPoRT—the amount and length 
of sessions across 4 weeks—includes reinforcing session 
content between and during sessions. Student-athletes 
perceived this as beneficial for retention. This was com -
pounded by the order of the session material, as noted by 
a female student-athlete: “I feel like the way you chose the 
order is like the best way like learn the information. ”
Content to keep
Student-athletes identified several positive features of the 
SPoRT intervention content, including learning about 
and engaging in a mindfulness exercise, interactive and 
competition-based activities, a variety of activity formats, 
and consistent check-ins and group discussions. Further, 
student-athletes specifically compared the content and delivery of SPoRT to the content and delivery of other 
NCAA sanctioned interventions as described below:
…this kind of stuff it’s usually like, an hour-long 
meeting of just somebody like talking at you, and I 
feel like this can be an awesome way to like break it 
up, get involved and interact like not just sit down 
and stare at a PowerPoint and listen the whole time.
Suggestions
Some participants expressed interest in including addi -
tional information in SPoRT not already embedded 
within the modules. One such topic discussed frequently 
across focus groups was the casual hook-up culture of 
college. Other participants discussed creating multiple 
activities for one topic in an effort to increase engage -
ment in the session material.
I just think it should be something where it’s individ -
ualized… because you know as people, we are very 
… some people lose track and stuff like that.
These changes or additions to the modules were coded 
as suggestions and reflect modifications that will be made 
to improve SPoRT for testing in an open pilot trial.
Modifications
Content that student-athletes identified as removable was 
identified as content subject to modification. For exam -
ple, a female student-athlete discussed removing take-
home activities designed to reinforce session content. She 
stated the following: “Honestly, I don’t really like that part 
that much. It feels more like a class and a chore than a 
training. ” Other modifications student-athletes discussed 
were regarding specific activities such as the consent and 
condom use activities in SPoRT. In discussing the con -
dom use activity, a male student-athlete said:
The concept of having a relay race is cool in the 
aspect that it’s like everybody working together and 
trying to figure things like that and maybe there’s 
a learning term for it but, tying back into what I 
was saying, like, that aspect of having a relay race 
might make it more of a joke than usual sexual 
interventions...I feel like the idea of the relay race 
will make it too informal if that make sense. Again, I 
would not know unless it started.
This student-athlete acknowledged that more interac -
tive activities may be viewed as less serious than some 
of the other activities that focus exclusively on reinforc -
ing SPoRT’s content without an interactive component. 
However, there was no consensus on material that should 
be removed across focus groups. Rather, student-athletes 
acknowledged their personal preference.

Discussion
Developed in collaboration with Division III student-ath -
letes, SPoRT represents an inclusive, targeted, data- and 
skills-driven intervention. SPoRT was designed to suit 
student-athletes’ needs and preferences. As such, stu -
dent-athletes expressed satisfaction with SPoRT’s content 
in addition to the delivery of that content. This includes 
the activities and other modules within SPoRT, the num -
ber of sessions, the length of those sessions, and session 
group sizes. Our success recruiting student-athletes to 
participate in the present study also suggests that it is fea -
sible to recruit student-athletes to participate in a rand -
omized controlled trial of the prevention intervention to 
evaluate the efficacy of SPoRT.
Quantitative and qualitative data analyses revealed 
that student-athletes found SPoRT to be a feasible and 
acceptable way to promote healthy relationships among 
student-athletes. Quantitative results identified student-
athlete’s comfort with discussing difficult topics included 
within SPoRT, such as DV, safe sex, and consent. These 
data also identified student-athletes’ willingness to par -
ticipate in SPoRT and their preference for interven -
tion delivery in the evenings, across 4  weeks, with four 
1-h and 15-min sessions. Qualitative results revealed 
specific strengths of SPoRT, such as its appropriateness 
and relevance to student-athletes, interactive modules, 
order in which content is delivered, the variety of con -
tent (i.e., healthy relationship and safe sex behaviors), 
use of emotion regulation and mindfulness-based coping 
strategies, small group sizes, and senior team leaders as 
co-facilitators.
These results likely reflect the development of SPoRT 
as a collaboration between researchers and student-
athletes. While these data continue to contribute to our 
understanding of our target population, they also reflect 
some necessary changes to SPoRT. These changes includ -
ing allowing flexibility in the activities are included 
within the session modules and the addition of content 
that speaks to casual relationships or hook-ups. This can 
be done through adding alternative activities based on 
athletes’ engagement in SPoRT and embedding content 
that describes student-athlete hook-up culture.
Making the proposed changes identified across focus 
groups can increase student-athletes’ satisfaction with 
SPoRT and improve outcomes. For example, includ -
ing alternative activities allows for our facilitators to uti -
lize those activities best suited to the group. Hands-on 
or physically oriented learners can engage in more active 
activities, while verbal or visual learners can take part in 
other activities that speak to both their learning style and 
strengths. This is consistent with previous literature stat -
ing student groups vary in learning style [78, 79]. Further, 
hook-up culture is an important topic to include within SPoRT. As such, by including discussions concerning risk 
factors associated with hook-up culture, we will increase 
the relevance and relatability of SPoRT. For example, hook-
up culture can be used to describe SRB and the subsequent 
importance of practicing safe sex strategies in an attempt 
to reduce risk for STIs and unintended pregnancy.
Limitations of this study include how the struc -
ture and content of SPoRT was presented to student-
athletes. Rather than engage participants in SPoRT in 
full intervention, participants received an overview of 
SPoRT while engaging in select discussions and activi -
ties. As such, these data do not reflect student-athletes’ 
perception of the full intervention. While this was done 
intentionally given certain constraints as the result of 
COVID-19, it is possible that intervention trial results 
may differ based on student-athletes’ ability to engage 
in SPORT as intended, in four 1-h and 15-min sessions 
across 4 weeks.
Future directions should include analyzing the prelimi -
nary efficacy of SPoRT following an open pilot trial of the 
full SPoRT intervention. This is consistent with the NIH 
Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development 
[63]. Identifying preliminary efficacy through an open 
pilot trial is included within Stage 1 and answers the 
question “does it work?” . Following completion of an open 
pilot trial, Stage II consists of randomized clinical trials 
to evaluate the efficacy of a manualized and pilot-tested 
intervention [64]. More than one RCT is often included 
within Stage II, as Stage III involves generalizability to a 
larger sample and implementation concerns, in addition 
to cost-effectiveness and marketing issues [64].
Other future directions involve identifying the gen -
eralizability of SPoRT. While SPoRT was designed to 
target the needs and behaviors of Division III student-
athletes, future studies can assess the generalizability of 
SPoRT to all NCAA divisions. Identifying specific differ -
ences between Divisions I, II, and III student-athletes can 
inform changes needed to modify SPoRT to target either 
NCAA Division I, II, or III student-athletes at a variety 
of universities. As such, our future goal is to understand 
how behaviors, needs, and preferences differ across 
Division I, Division II, and Division III student-athletes. 
Ultimately, we hope that SPoRT can meet the healthy 
relationship prevention intervention needs of student-
athletes across divisions.
