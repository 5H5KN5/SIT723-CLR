Abstract 
Background: Physical inactivity is a main cause of childhood obesity which tracks into adulthood obesity, mak -
ing it important to address early in life. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) is an evidence-based intervention that 
has shown good effect on physical activity levels in adults, but has not been evaluated in children with obesity. This 
project aims to evaluate the prerequisites, determinants, and feasibility of implementing PAP adapted to children with 
obesity and to explore children’s, parents’ , and healthcare providers’ experiences of PAP .
Methods: In the first phase of the project, healthcare providers and managers from 26 paediatric clinics in Region 
Västra Götaland, Sweden, will be invited to participate in a web-based survey and a subset of this sample for a focus 
group study. Findings from these two data collections will form the basis for adaptation of PAP to the target group 
and context. In a second phase, this adapted PAP intervention will be evaluated in a clinical study in a sample of 
approximately 60 children with obesity (ISO-BMI > 30) between 6 and 12 years of age and one of their parents/legal 
guardians. Implementation process and clinical outcomes will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 8 and 
12 months’ follow-up. Implementation outcomes are the four core constructs of the Normalization Process Theory; 
coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring; and appropriateness, acceptability, and 
feasibility of the PAP intervention. Additional implementation process outcomes are recruitment and attrition rates, 
intervention fidelity, dose, and adherence. Clinical outcomes are physical activity pattern, BMI, metabolic risk factors, 
health-related quality of life, sleep, and self-efficacy and motivation for physical activity. Lastly, we will explore the 
perspectives of children and parents in semi-structured interviews. Design and analysis of the included studies are 
guided by the Normalization Process Theory.
Discussion: This project will provide new knowledge regarding the feasibility of PAP for children with obesity and 
about whether and how an evidence-based intervention can be fitted and adapted to new contexts and populations.

Contributions to the literature
• “Physical activity on prescription” is an evidence-
based, complex intervention that is proven effective 
on adults, but neither implementation outcomes nor 
process has been evaluated in the context of paediat -
ric health care.
• The hybrid-designed feasibility project combines 
process and outcome evaluations and uses both 
quantitative and qualitative methods.
• The use of Normalization Process Theory as a frame -
work for the whole project will contribute to the lit -
erature on its application in various contexts.
• The project will contribute knowledge on the feasibil -
ity of whether and how an evidence-based interven -
tion can be adapted and fitted to another population 
and context.
Background
Childhood overweight and obesity is one of the most 
important global public health concerns in the twenty-
first century. Prevalence has increased dramatically over 
the last four decades and remains high in many countries 
[1, 2]. The prevalence of overweight in European children 
aged 5–9 years was 28.9% in 2016, and the prevalence of 
obesity was 11.4% [3]. In Sweden, 21% of children aged 
6–9 were overweight or obese in 2019, an increase by 
14% since 2016 [4]. Of those 21%, 6% had obesity, up 
from 4% in 2016. Within this age group, the prevalence 
was twice as high in 9-year olds than in 6-year olds. There 
is also a gender difference, with an 11% obesity preva -
lence in boys versus 9% in girls [4]. Parent’s income level, 
education level, and country of birth are key predictors of 
lifestyle habits and obesity in children [5].
Physical inactivity is, alongside a poor diet, the main 
driver of childhood obesity [6]. As obesity in childhood 
tracks into adulthood [7, 8], addressing physical inactiv -
ity in early life is crucial. Particularly in middle child -
hood, social factors and physical inactivity are important 
risk factors for obesity [9]. Physical activity (i.e. any bod -
ily movement that increases energy expenditure above 
a basal level [10]) has well-documented positive effects 
on physical and mental functions in children and is also 
important in relation to risk factors for lifestyle-related diseases, such as overweight/obesity, diabetes type 2, and 
to cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors [11, 12]. For 
children who are overweight or obese, physical activity 
has been shown to yield positive effects on weigh-related 
outcomes, especially when combined with dietary advice 
[13]. A recent systematic review of physical activity inter -
ventions in children with obesity showed effects on both 
body mass index (BMI) and physical activity [14]. Other 
reviews, however, are inconsistent, showing little to no 
effects on physical activity [15, 16].
In Sweden, national recommendations are that all chil -
dren between 6 and 17 years should be physically active 
at least 60 min per day at a moderate-to-vigorous level 
[12], and that children who are insufficiently physically 
active should be offered physical activity counselling 
in health care [17]. The WHO also recommends limit -
ing sedentary time and recreational screen time, which 
have shown detrimental effects on, e.g. physical fitness, 
metabolic health and school performance [18]. For chil -
dren with obesity, physical activity at least 3 times/week 
at 75% of maximal heart frequency is recommended, for 
effects on lipids and insulin sensitivity [12]. Studies show 
that parents’ physical activity levels generally are linked 
to child physical activity levels, and parental support is 
perceived as crucial, indicating the benefit of involving 
parents in research on children [19–21].
Obesity is considered a complex multifactorial condi -
tion [22], and behaviour change interventions aiming 
to improve dietary intake, increase physical activity, 
and reduce sedentary behaviour are often prescribed 
and recommended [23]. One such intervention that 
aims to change physical activity behaviour is “physical 
activity on prescription” (PAP). This is an intervention 
developed in Sweden to promote physical activity and 
motivate the patient to increase their physical activity 
level [24]. Several studies have shown effectiveness of 
Swedish PAP in adult populations, including patients 
with overweight or obesity, measured as increased 
physical activity levels [25]. There is, however, a pau -
city of studies of PAP for children and adolescents. One 
small study investigated PAP in children with cerebral 
palsy and found PAP to be both feasible and leading to 
increased physical activity levels [25]. For children with 
obesity, no study has been identified that evaluates the 
implementation or effect of PAP . Before conducting a 
definite effectiveness trial, it is important to evaluate The results may inform a larger scale trial and future implementation and may enhance the role of PAP in the manage -
ment of obesity in paediatric health care in Sweden.

the feasibility and prerequisites for implementing this 
potentially behaviour-changing intervention in paediat -
ric health care. The vulnerability of the patient group, 
the parental involvement, and the complexity of the 
intervention make it particularly important to investi -
gate areas of uncertainty in a future effectiveness trial 
so that, e.g. recruitment, attrition, intervention fidelity, 
and other feasibility measures can be assessed and may 
be tweaked prior to a main trial.
When studying and implementing new interventions in 
a complex context such as health care, it is important to 
examine implementation determinants that can be used 
to develop an effective implementation strategy. Imple -
mentation determinants are factors that might prevent 
or enable improvements in professional practice [26] 
and are commonly used as an umbrella term for factors 
that hinder (barriers) and facilitate or enable (facilitators) 
implementation. They exist at several levels, including 
patient level, organisational level, and the wider environ -
ment/society [27]. Barriers for implementing PAP for 
adults that have been identified among Swedish primary 
healthcare providers include lack of knowledge about the 
intervention and lack of organisational support [28–30]. 
Facilitators include affirmative attitudes among col -
leagues and central and local supporting structures. For 
children, family support and parental role models are 
crucial when implementing physical activity, underscor -
ing the need to involve parents in any efforts to promote 
physical activity [19, 31]. However, no study has investi -
gated determinants for implementation of PAP for chil -
dren with obesity.
This project addresses the above knowledge gaps. 
Increased knowledge and understanding of these factors 
are essential for successful implementation of PAP as an 
intervention for treatment of obesity in paediatric health 
care. The project will contribute important findings that 
can form the basis for implementation efforts in Region 
Västra Götaland, Sweden, and beyond. It will also provide 
knowledge about the feasibility of PAP for children with 
obesity, as well as about how an evidence-based interven -
tion can be adapted to a new context and population and 
how implementation can be facilitated.
Aims
The overarching aim of this project is to evaluate the pre -
requisites, determinants, and feasibility of implement -
ing PAP for children with obesity in paediatric health 
care. Quantitative studies will investigate implementa -
tion and clinical outcomes, while qualitative studies will 
explore implementation determinants among different 
stakeholders.
Specific study objectives are as follows:• Study 1: To examine how healthcare professionals 
and managers perceive working with PAP for chil -
dren with obesity in terms of coherence, cognitive 
participation, collective action, and reflexive moni -
toring and how they perceive acceptability, appro -
priateness, and feasibility of a PAP intervention and, 
furthermore, to explore barriers and facilitators for 
working with PAP for children with obesity.
• Study 2: To explore experiences, barriers, and facili -
tators for using PAP for children with obesity among 
healthcare professionals and managers.
• Study 3: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability 
of a PAP intervention for children with obesity on 
implementation outcomes and clinical outcomes, 
with physical activity pattern being the primary clini -
cal outcome variable.
• Study 4: To explore children’s and parents’ experi -
ences of participating in a PAP intervention, with a 
focus on perceived barriers and facilitators for imple -
menting PAP .
Specific research questions are presented in Table 1.
Methods
Findings from the individual studies will be reported 
according to the appropriate EQUATOR checklist [32, 
33]. This protocol is reported according to the SPIRIT 
checklist [34], supplemented by relevant items from 
the CONSORT extension to pilot and feasibility tri -
als [35]. The clinical study is registered in clinical trials 
(NCT04847271). Any important changes to the protocol 
will be amended in the registry and reported in the rele -
vant publication. A brief structured summary of the clini -
cal study in the format of a WHO trial registration data 
set is provided in Supplementary file 1.
Study design
An overview of the research project and design of the 
different studies is outlined in Fig.  1. The project incor -
porates qualitative and quantitative research methods 
and comprises four studies to be performed over 4 years, 
divided into two phases. The design, including combin -
ing feasibility with outcome evaluation, follows guidance 
from the Medical Research Council on assessing feasibil -
ity and evaluating complex interventions [36]. It is con -
sistent with a hybrid type-1 approach, in which a clinical 
intervention will be tested while concurrently evaluating 
the implementation process by gathering information 
on its delivery and potential for implementation in a 
real-world situation [37]. Both implementation process 
outcomes and clinical outcomes will be assessed. In 
phase 1, two studies target healthcare professionals and 
managers in paediatric health care. Study 1 investigates

implementation determinants among staff and managers 
at paediatric clinics in a cross-sectional, web-based sur -
vey. Study 2 builds on the implementation determinants 
identified in the survey and further explores them in a 
subsample of this population, using focus group discus -
sions. Findings from these two studies will feed into an 
adaptation of PAP and provide input for an implementa -
tion strategy for phase 2 of the project. This second phase 
includes a clinical intervention in which the adapted PAP 
intervention is tested using a single-group before-after 
design (study 3) and a qualitative interview study (study 
4). The clinical intervention will be evaluated using a 
single-group design in which children and one of their 
parents/guardians will take part in a PAP intervention for 
4 months. Clinical outcomes in children and parents will 
be assessed after the intervention, with long-term follow-
ups at 8 and 12 months after baseline. Pre- to post-inter -
vention changes in implementation outcomes will also 
be measured using the same questionnaire as in study 
1, with follow-up 12 months after baseline. Process out -
come data will be collected during and after the interven -
tion. Finally, a qualitative interview study (study 4) will 
explore experiences of PAP treatment among children 
with obesity and their parents/guardians. A reference 
group that includes children, parents/guardians, health -
care professionals, managers, and other stakeholders will 
be consulted throughout the project.
Theoretical framework
Health care and healthcare systems have a high degree 
of complexity [38], involving a multitude of perspec -
tives, structures, and stakeholders and making it a par -
ticularly challenging context in which to implement new 
interventions and other practices. Promoting and pre -
scribing physical activity to children with obesity are a 
complex healthcare intervention, embedded by social 
processes surrounding the child that may involve their 
family, friends, the school, community, sports arenas/
clubs, and the healthcare system. When studying and 
implementing a complex intervention in a complex con -
text such as health care, as in this project, the use of a 
theoretical framework may facilitate implementation and 
increase the chances for its success [26, 39]. A theoreti -
cal framework for implementation that can explain social 
processes related to the necessary change of the childs’ 
behaviour is appropriate.
The Normalization Process Theory (NPT) was devel -
oped to understand and explain the social processes that 
frame the implementation of complex interventions in 
health care [38]. This theory is particularly suitable for 
feasibility studies of complex interventions in complex 
contexts, such as health care [40]. The NPT posits that 
implementation is a dynamic process, involving all those who carry out the implementation: healthcare profes -
sionals, organisational leaders, and patients and their 
families [41]. The theory is concerned with explaining 
what people do rather than their attitudes, beliefs, or 
perceptions and comprises 4 core constructs: coherence 
(sense making), cognitive participation (engagement), 
collective action (working/operationalising the inter -
vention), and reflexive monitoring (evaluation). These 
constructs, which drive the implementation process, 
represent ways of thinking about implementation and 
focus on how interventions can become part of everyday 
practice [40].
In this project, the NPT was used in the planning of 
the project and will be used both as a framework for the 
qualitative studies and as a support for the clinical study 
in which we will examine implementation outcomes 
using an NPT-based instrument. Data collection, analy -
sis, and reporting of findings will be guided by the NPT.
Setting
The empirical arena of this research is the paediatric 
healthcare organisation in Region Västra Götaland, as 
well as the PAP clinics in Gothenburg. The paediatric 
healthcare organisation comprises seven specialist pae -
diatric clinics in the city of Gothenburg, six clinics in 
surrounding communities, and 13 clinics in the remain -
ing part of Region Västra Götaland. Approximately, 240 
healthcare professionals (paediatric nurses, paediatri -
cians, psychologists, dieticians, and physiotherapists) are 
involved in the treatment of children with obesity. For 
the clinical intervention, clinics in Gothenburg and sur -
rounding communities will be invited to participate.
The PAP intervention
The intervention that is to be adapted and evaluated in 
the clinical intervention (study 3) comprises PAP accord -
ing to standardised procedures and, if needed, additional 
support provided by the PAP clinics. The PAP interven -
tion itself consists of 3 core elements: a person-centred 
counselling dialogue, individually tailored physical activ -
ity recommendations with a written prescription, and 
individualised, structured follow-up (13). The initial dia -
logue is based on motivational interviewing [42], which 
has shown promising results in the treatment of paedi -
atric obesity [43–45]. This counselling technique incor -
porates discussion about the patient’s self-efficacy beliefs 
and motivation for physical activity, known mediators of 
physical activity behaviour change [46–48].
The prescription includes recommendations for one or 
several types of physical activity that can be individual 
or group based and carried out in different settings, e.g. 
home, school, gym, or outdoors. Frequency, duration, 
and intensity of the chosen physical activity are specified. 
Page 6 of 15 Bernhardsson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:117 
Available group activities are typically arranged by pri -
vate or municipal associations.
In study 3, included children and parents/guardians 
will participate in an adapted PAP intervention during 4 
months. The study period will be spread out over a cal -
endar year, which will allow for seasonal variation in the 
activities provided and a mix of indoors and outdoors 
physical activity. At the end of the 4-month intervention, 
the participants will be encouraged to continue with their 
chosen activity or try another activity of their choice. To 
support implementation and facilitate sustainability, the 
intervention will be aligned with current standard care 
processes, existing infrastructure will be used, and the 
intervention will predominantly be carried out by regular 
staff at the paediatric clinics.
Adaptation and implementation
Adaptation of PAP to the target group and the context 
will be performed in collaboration with the Centre for 
Physical Activity (CFFA) Gothenburg and representa -
tives from paediatric health care, based on the findings 
from studies 1 and 2 and with input from the reference 
group. Adaptation is defined as a systematically planned 
and proactive process of modification aiming to fit the 
intervention into a new context and enhance its accept -
ability [47, 49]. The 2019 systematic review by Movsisyan 
et  al. [49] will be used as guidance for the adaptation, 
considering the specific needs of the population and the 
circumstances of the paediatric healthcare organisa -
tion and assuring intervention salience and fit with the 
new context. The implementation determinants identi -
fied in study 1 and study 2 will be addressed in the PAP 
adaptation.
The identified implementation determinants also will 
provide input to the development of a tailored implemen -
tation strategy for those units who choose to participate 
in the clinical intervention. To support implementation 
of the adapted PAP intervention, information/education 
material will be developed. Relevant healthcare profes -
sionals will be offered education on the effects of physi -
cal activity, concept and components of PAP , and how to 
organise the structure of PAP routines on a local basis. 
Other educational needs identified in the survey and 
focus groups will also be addressed. A register of locally 
available physical activity service providers, e.g. sports 
associations, will be developed.
Recruitment of study participants and sample size
For the assessment of implementation determinants in 
study 1, comprising a cross-sectional survey, all approx -
imately 240 healthcare professionals and managers 
involved in the treatment of children with obesity at the different paediatric healthcare clinics in Region Västra 
Götaland will be invited to participate.
For study 2, comprising focus groups, we plan to recruit 
approximately 30 healthcare professionals of various dis -
ciplines who have experience from treating children with 
obesity and have some experience of using PAP . They will 
be recruited from paediatric clinics in Gothenburg and 
surrounding communities. Eligible healthcare profes -
sionals are paediatric nurses, assistant nurses, paediatri -
cians, psychologists, dieticians, and physiotherapists. In 
addition, 6–10 first-line managers, senior managers, and 
development managers from the paediatric organisation 
will be recruited. A purposive sampling strategy will be 
used to select eligible participants.
For the assessment of clinical outcomes in study 3, we 
aim to recruit approximately 60 children with obesity 
who have been prescribed PAP and one of their parents/
guardians from the paediatric clinics in Gothenburg 
and surrounding communities who agree to participate. 
Because this is a feasibility study, we have not undertaken 
a formal sample size calculation but aim to include a suf -
ficient number of participants to provide information 
about practicalities such as recruitment and attrition 
rates, intervention fidelity, dose, and adherence, as well 
as for statistical analyses of clinical outcomes. We have 
also given consideration to the likelihood of a fairly large 
attrition rate at each time point. Uncertainties about the 
recruitment procedure, the capacity to achieve an appro -
priate sample size, and the intervention itself will be con -
sidered in terms of feasibility and whether it is of value 
to proceed to full-scale evaluation. Children and parents 
will be screened for eligibility by the staff at the partici -
pating paediatric clinics in conjunction with their first 
visit. All who meet the inclusion criteria will be given oral 
and written information about the study and asked about 
interest in participating. Inclusion criteria are as follows: 
being aged 6–12 years, diagnosed with obesity (BMI > 
ISO-BMI 30), having an insufficient physical activity level 
according to national recommendations, and having a 
parent who is willing to participate. Insufficient physi -
cal activity level is defined as not reaching the national 
guidelines recommendation of 60 min of moderate to 
vigorous physical activity per day [12]. Exclusion crite -
ria are as follows severe psychiatric comorbidity, severe 
intellectual or physical disability, or planning to relocate 
outside the study area within 12 months. To support 
recruitment and reach the desired sample size, site coor -
dinators will be appointed, trained, and provided with 
adequate study material.
For study 4, we expect to recruit approximately 10–15 
children-parent pairs. Sample size cannot be determined 
in advance because data collection should ideally go on 
until no new information emerges in the interviews.

 Bernhardsson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:117 
 
Eligible children and parents/guardians will be identi -
fied in collaboration with staff at the involved clinics. 
A purposive sampling strategy will be used, aiming for 
maximum variation in gender, age, parent’s gender, age, 
and education. Inclusion criteria will include being aged 
6–12 years, diagnosed with obesity, having an insufficient 
physical activity level, and having a parent who is willing 
to participate. Parents will be approached and invited to 
participate by the project coordinator, who will provide 
oral and written information about the study and its aims 
and give the opportunity to ask questions.
Patient involvement
Both users (healthcare professionals) and end users (par -
ents of children with obesity) have been involved in the 
design and planning of the project. We will continue to 
solicit user input throughout the project. We are collabo -
rating with the patient organisation HOBS (health inde -
pendent of size). User representatives are included in the 
reference group. The reference group will be consulted 
on an as-needed basis (e.g. in the recruiting process, the 
adaptation of PAP , the development of the clinical inter -
vention, and in developing intervention material). Chil -
dren’s and parents’ views and experiences of PAP will be 
solicited in interviews (study 4), which will contribute to 
evaluation of the PAP intervention and its feasibility, and 
provide input to further development of the intervention.
Data collection and outcomes
Implementation outcomes
Implementation outcomes will be measured pre-imple -
mentation, post-intervention, and at 12-months follow-
up. Data will primarily be collected from healthcare 
professionals and managers through a web-based ques -
tionnaire comprising several validated instruments. 
Primary implementation outcomes are the four core con -
structs of the NPT: coherence, cognitive participation, 
collective action, and reflexive monitoring. They will be 
assessed using the Normalization MeAsure Development 
(NoMAD), which measures implementation from an 
NPT perspective and reflects the four constructs [50, 51]. 
The validated Swedish version S-NoMAD [52] is used 
in this project and has been adapted to fit children with 
obesity and address both healthcare professionals and 
managers. The S-NoMAD comprises 23 items, answered 
on 11-point or 5-point Likert-type scales.
Secondary implementation outcomes are the accept -
ability, appropriateness, and feasibility of implementing 
PAP in paediatric health care. Acceptability is defined 
as the perception among stakeholders that a given treat -
ment, service, practice, or innovation is agreeable, pal -
atable, or satisfactory; appropriateness is the perceived 
fit, relevance, or compatibility of the innovation or evidence-based practice for a given practice setting, pro -
vider, or consumer and/or perceived fit of the innovation 
to address a particular issue or problem; and feasibil -
ity is the extent to which a new treatment, or an inno -
vation, can be successfully used or carried out within a 
given agency or setting [53]. These outcomes will be 
measured with the Acceptability of Intervention Measure 
(AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), 
and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) [54], all 
validated instruments with the purpose of assessing the 
fit and match of a practice or intervention to a given con -
text, targeting different criteria [54]. The three measures 
comprise 4 items each, answered on 5-point Likert-type 
scales. Before use, they were translated and cross-cultur -
ally adapted into Swedish and adapted to children with 
obesity, following established procedures including for -
ward and backward translation and validating the trans -
lation using cognitive debriefing [55, 56]. The translation 
aimed to produce a language version with conceptual 
equivalence with the original and relevance to the new 
target culture and context.
Barriers and facilitators will be explored in two open-
ended questions, in which the respondents will be 
given the opportunity to describe their experiences and 
thoughts regarding determinants for implementing PAP 
in their clinic, expressed in their own words. They will 
also be further explored in the focus group study.
Acceptability of the intervention from the child’s per -
spective will be measured with the Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire (CSQ-8) [57], translated to Swedish and 
adapted to children and parents. Feasibility for the child 
to participate in PAP will also be examined by collecting 
process data on fees, equipment, and transport costs of 
the chosen physical activity, as well as travel time, time 
spent at the activity, and at assessments and other con -
tacts during the intervention.
Additional implementation process outcomes will be 
assessed as follows: recruitment and attrition rates will 
be examined. When possible and if participants con -
sent, reasons for dropout will be documented. Interven -
tion fidelity (intervention delivery as intended) and dose 
(quantity of intervention) will be captured by monitoring 
intervention components delivered. Other simultaneous 
treatment, e.g. dietary recommendations, will be docu -
mented. Availability of local physical activities will be 
documented. Data regarding intervention adherence and 
participation in the chosen physical activities will be col -
lected via analogue and/or digital activity diaries.
Clinical outcomes
All clinical outcomes will be measured pre- and post-
intervention and at 8 and 12 months’ after baseline. 
The primary clinical outcome will be physical activity

level, measured as minutes per day spent in moder -
ate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and assessed 
using the Axivity accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Axivity 
Ltd., UK). Accelometry is the most commonly used 
method in clinical and epidemiological research for 
objective measurement of physical activity, is easy to 
use for the study participant and the researcher, and 
has a high sensitivity for detecting changes in physical 
activity (30). The accelerometer will be placed above 
the child’s and parent’s hip in an elastic belt and worn 
24 h per day for seven consecutive days. In this posi -
tion, the accelerometer can be used to assess physi -
cal activity at different intensities. The accelerometer 
recording is accompanied by an activity diary to deter -
mine bedtime, non-wear time, and sport activities. A 
strict protocol for data quality assurance (malfunction, 
spurious data, wear time, valid days) will be used. A 
project coordinator will provide the accelerometer to 
the participants together with oral and written instruc -
tions, support the participants if necessary, and collect 
the accelerometer after use. Measurement procedure, 
quality assurance, data processing, and analysis will be 
supported by an experienced team at the Center for 
Health and Performance [58].
Secondary clinical outcomes will be physical activ -
ity patterns (time spent in different types of activities 
and at different intensity levels, including sedentary 
time) measured with accelerometry; anthropomet -
ric measures, i.e. BMI; and waist circumference, col -
lected from medical charts. Metabolic risk markers 
will be assessed via blood pressure measures and blood 
samples, including fasting plasma glucose, high- and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin resist -
ance, and triglycerides. In addition, patient-reported 
health-related quality of life will be measured using 
KIDSCREEN-10 [59], and the child’s sleep will be 
measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) 
[60, 61]. Parents’ perception about their child’s sleep 
will be measured using the Pediatric Insomnia Sever -
ity Index (PISI) [62, 63]. The child’s self-efficacy for 
physical activity, and motivation for physical activity, 
will be measured with validated instruments adapted 
to children with obesity and parents and appropriately 
translated to Swedish [64– 67]. Adverse events will be 
monitored and documented.
Demographic data on children will be collected at 
baseline, including age, gender, comorbidities, and 
country of birth. Data on participating parents/guard -
ians include age, gender, BMI, comorbidities, country 
of birth, and education level.
To enable missing data analysis, demographic data 
will also be collected for those who decline participa -
tion, when possible.Qualitative data
For study 2, data will be collected from healthcare pro -
fessionals and managers using focus group methodology 
[68]. Semi-structured focus group discussions will be 
conducted, with groups comprising a mix of professions. 
Managers will form separate focus groups. The focus 
group methodology was chosen to stimulate discussion 
among the participants and capture collective interaction 
and experiences. The discussions will be facilitated by a 
moderator and an observer. Discussions will be recorded 
and transcribed verbatim. A discussion guide will be 
developed to ensure that adequate data responding to the 
research questions are collected, and that the four NPT 
constructs are covered in the discussions.
For study 4, data will be collected in individual, semi-
structured interviews with children who have partici -
pated in the PAP intervention and one of their parents/
guardians. A purposive sampling strategy will be used, 
aiming to ensure maximum variation in the sample (e.g. 
child gender and age, parent gender, age, education level, 
and country of birth). Data collection will continue until 
no new information seems to be forthcoming in the 
interviews. The interviews will be recorded and tran -
scribed verbatim. An interview guide will be developed 
to ensure that adequate data responding to the research 
questions are collected.
Data analysis
Implementation outcomes
Implementation outcome data will be analysed in two 
steps. First (in study 1, where the purpose of this sur -
vey is to assess healthcare providers’ perceptions of PAP 
treatment with the aim of identifying implementation 
barriers and facilitators), baseline (pre-intervention) data 
will be analysed descriptively using absolute and relative 
frequencies, as well as means and standard deviations. 
Differences between age groups, years’ of experience, and 
different professions will be analysed using chi-square 
tests We will do a subgroup analysis of respondents from 
the Gothenburg clinics in which PAP has already been 
implemented, including access to extra support from 
the PAP clinics. Second (in study 3), in the subset of the 
study 1 participants in which the intervention is carried 
out, we will perform longitudinal analysis of changes 
after participating in the intervention, using data from 
pre- and post-intervention, and follow-up at 12 months 
after baseline. Average change over time will be analysed 
across the three time points using mixed linear model -
ling, given the assumption that data are normally distrib -
uted. Analyses will be per protocol, and missing data will 
be handled with maximum likelihood estimation. The 
free text answers to the open-ended questions related 
Page 9 of 15
 Bernhardsson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:117 
 
to implementation determinants will be analysed using 
qualitative content analysis [69].
Clinical outcomes
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise char -
acteristics of the participants and will be presented as 
means with standard deviations or frequencies and 
percentages. For physical activity outcomes, raw accel -
erometer data will be processed and filtered in several 
steps to a measure of activity intensity (mg) [58]. Previ -
ously developed and tested calibration equations for 
body positions, activity type, and for activity intensities 
will be applied [70, 71]. Accelerometer data will be ana -
lysed in 3-s epochs in order to accurately detect normal 
variation in physical activity [58]. Continuous data on 
physical activity patterns at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months, 
will be analysed using multivariate regression analysis 
for repeated measures, controlled for multicollinearity 
between intensity levels. To examine potential influences 
of demographic and parental factors (gender, age, educa -
tion level, country of birth) on physical activity patterns, 
the models will be adjusted for these variables. Change 
in absolute BMI in kg/m2 and in metabolic risk markers 
in mmol/L will be calculated and analysed using mixed 
linear modelling. Standardised measures for the separate 
risk factors waist circumference, insulin resistance, sys -
tolic and diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipopro -
tein, and triglycerides will also be combined in a so-called 
MetS score and analysed using mixed linear modelling. 
Patient-reported outcomes will also be analysed using 
mixed linear modelling and adjusted for the same demo -
graphic and parental factors. Changes over time will be 
presented with 95% confidence intervals. The self-effi -
cacy and motivation variables’ potential mediating role 
for physical activity will also be explored by including 
these parameters into the models as covariates. Statistical 
significance will be set at p < 0.05.
Qualitative data
Data from the focus group discussions will be analysed 
using qualitative content analysis for focus groups [68]. A 
combination of inductive and deductive analysis will be 
used. Codes will first be developed inductively from the 
transcribed focus group sessions, and then, in a deduc -
tive approach using NPT as a coding framework, sorted 
into categories that reflect the four constructs of the 
NPT. Findings that cut across categories will be devel -
oped into one or several themes capturing the essence 
of the discussions and allowing for interpretation and a 
higher level of abstraction.
Data from the interviews with children and their par -
ents will be analysed inductively using qualitative con -
tent analysis reflecting manifest and latent content of the interviews [69]. Meaning units of the transcribed inter -
views will be identified, condensed, and coded. Codes 
will be compared and, based on similarities, classified 
into categories and subcategories that describe the mani -
fest content. Lastly, one or several overarching themes 
will be formulated based on the latent content that can be 
discerned across the categories.
Ethical considerations and data management
In study 1, written participant information is provided 
via a link in the email that invites participants to answer 
the survey, and participants acknowledge having read the 
information and provide their consent by checking a box 
in the survey. In studies 2–4, written informed consent 
will be obtained from all participants. In studies 3–4, 
children and their parents/guardians will be provided 
oral and written information about the respective study, 
and informed parental consent and child assent will be 
obtained by the project coordinator or a site coordinator. 
Written information will be developed in a child version 
and a parent version. Because we consider it important to 
not exclude eligible non-Swedish-speaking children and 
parents, several language versions will also be developed, 
and interpreters will be available for those who do not 
speak Swedish or English.
A data management plan (DMP) has been developed, 
providing details on how data will be collected and man -
aged throughout the project, as well as how they will 
be documented, stored, and archived after the project 
has been concluded. The DMP also contains informa -
tion about how, when, where, and to whom data will be 
made available. The DMP can be provided on reason -
able request from the principal investigator. Routines 
for data storage from Region Västra Götaland will be fol -
lowed, and metadata standards will be used to describe 
the data material. A data management team will manage 
and monitor data accuracy and quality and comprises the 
principal investigator, the project coordinator/doctoral 
student, a postdoc researcher, and a research assistant. 
All study data, including the final study dataset, will be 
treated confidentially, and access will be restricted to the 
research team. When reporting findings, no data will be 
traceable to individual participants.

Discussion
This research project investigates the feasibility of imple -
menting physical activity on prescription to address 
childhood obesity, a global health issue of great and grow -
ing importance. The pre-implementation, hybrid design 
feasibility project was designed to evaluate the prereq -
uisites, determinants, and feasibility of implementing 
PAP adapted to children with obesity and to explore the 
experiences of children, parents, and healthcare provid -
ers related to their experiences, attitudes, and perceived 
determinants for implementation. Implementation out -
comes will be collected using questionnaires, based on 
validated instruments, before, during, and after a pilot 
implementation in participating paediatric clinics. Clini -
cal outcomes will be collected from children and parents 
pre- and post-intervention and at 8 and 12 months from 
baseline. The process will be followed closely, and pro -
cess evaluation data will be collected during and after the 
intervention. The project is expected to show whether 
PAP is a feasible intervention and has a place among 
other treatment options in paediatric health care.
The hybrid type-1 implementation-effectiveness 
approach is a useful design that allows parallel evalu -
ation of the implementation process, preconditions, 
and determinants, as well as clinical outcomes [37]. It 
is particularly suitable in a context where the interven -
tion is supported by evidence in one population but 
needs to be adapted and tested in another population 
while simultaneously assessing barriers and facilitators 
to “real-world” implementation of this intervention. 
This design is often used when testing an intervention 
in a randomised controlled trial design but can also 
be applied for the type of single-arm feasibility study 
in which an intervention is evaluated using a before-
after approach. An important advantage of the hybrid 
design is that it could speed up the process of translat -
ing research findings into routine practice and allow for 
addressing many implementation research questions 
earlier than what could be achieved in a more tradi -
tional, linear “efficacy-effectiveness-implementation” 
approach [37]. The combination of outcome and process 
evaluation is particularly relevant in interventions that 
involve multiple stakeholders and, as in this case, par -
tially is conducted in community settings where contex -
tual factors will influence intervention outcomes [72].
Our choice of NPT as a theoretical framework for the 
project was based on its focus on the social processes 
surrounding the child, involving multiple stakehold -
ers both within and outside the healthcare system. In addition to guiding implementation planning, its use also 
may help explain social processes related to implement -
ing PAP in paediatric health care. The PAP intervention 
is complex and involves multiple healthcare professions 
and a range of other stakeholders, in addition to the child 
itself and their family. It also includes multiple processes 
that may be better understood through the lens of an 
implementation theory such as the NPT. Further advan -
tages of using NPT is its empirical grounding in health 
care and its description as being stabile, robust, and user-
friendly [73].
There is an abundance of measures to choose from 
when assessing implementation outcomes, with a varying 
range of psychometric quality [74]. We strived to select 
the most appropriate, relevant, and validated measures. 
The NPT-based S-NoMAD will be used to assess the 
implementation process, with a focus on the collective 
action employed in the different work processes involved 
in the treatment of children with obesity in the paediatric 
healthcare context. We chose the NPT constructs as pri -
mary implementation outcomes because they represent 
the mechanisms that shape the implementation process 
looking into a real-world setting, in this case a paediat -
ric healthcare organisation. Furthermore, the S-NoMAD 
can be used to point out problems that can be addressed 
when implementing the intervention, as well as to assess 
the implementation process over time [37]. Supplement -
ing S-NoMAD with the AIM, IAM, and FIM instruments 
will allow us to also assess implementation outcomes 
that are important determinants for implementation suc -
cess. These outcomes have been proposed to be the most 
salient implementation outcomes to measure before the 
start of an implementation process in which an evidence-
based practice is adapted and implemented [53]. The 
instruments are very brief, giving excellent usability, and 
have been rigorously developed and psychometrically 
tested [ 54].
A challenge when adapting a clinical intervention 
such as PAP that has been evaluated and found effective 
in another context is that adaptation by default means 
that intervention fidelity is not maintained [49]. Fidel -
ity is considered important for implementation success 
[75] and an important part of a process evaluation [76]. 
However, a high degree of intervention fidelity requires 
strict adherence to a protocol and implies a top-down 
approach to implementation, whereas adaptation that 
involves engaging users and other stakeholders reflects a 
bottom-up approach [77]. This approach is not only more 
politically appealing from a social development perspec -
tive but is also likely to improve acceptability and feasibil -
ity of the intervention in the new context.
We chose physical activity level as primary clinical 
outcome because increasing physical activity is the main 
Page 12 of 15 Bernhardsson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:117 
goal of the PAP intervention and because the effect of 
PAP on activity level has been established in adults [78]. 
We will assess physical activity objectively using acceler -
ometers in this project as it reduces measurement errors 
associated with subjective methods, especially in children 
[58]. In addition, a robust measurement protocol will be 
applied to assure a high-quality standard, considering all 
steps from data collection to processing to achieve useful 
and reliable measures [58].
We will collect clinical outcome data immediately 
post-intervention and again at 8 and 12 months from 
baseline. It is well known that behaviour change takes 
time, and continued physical activity will be encour -
aged at the end of the intervention period. Conversely, 
it has also been shown that a positive change post-
intervention, for example in BMI, may not be sustained 
in the long term [13].
PAP has already been used at several paediatric 
healthcare units, to varied extents, both in Region 
Västra Götaland and elsewhere in Sweden. This, 
together with the fact that PAP is a well-established 
intervention for adults, constitutes a clinical advantage 
and should facilitate a wider implementation of the 
intervention, if found effective, throughout the region 
and, later, to other regions in Sweden and potentially 
elsewhere. This project is expected to generate new 
knowledge regarding the feasibility of adapting PAP to 
children, as well as about whether and how an evidence-
based intervention can be fitted and adapted to new 
contexts and populations. The qualitative study find -
ings will increase our understanding of implementation 
determinants, including contextual factors, and of chil -
drens’ and parents’ experience of participating in a PAP 
intervention. The study results may form the basis for 
a larger scale clinical trial, may guide future implemen -
tation, and may potentially enhance the role of physi -
cal activity in the management of obesity in paediatric 
health care in Sweden. If the adapted PAP intervention 
shows positive results on physical activity levels and 
other outcomes for the children included in this study, 
the prospects are good for implementing the interven -
tion in routine paediatric health care.
Strengths and limitations
Main strengths of the project are the hybrid design 
with assessment of both implementation and clinical 
outcomes, the use of both quantitative and qualita -
tive methods and validated outcome measures, and 
the objective measurement of the primary clinical 
outcome. Further strengths include the application of 
a well-established, appropriate implementation the -
ory in both quantitative and qualitative studies, the involvement of children and parents throughout the 
project, and the long-term follow-up. The main limita -
tion of the project is the lack of control group and ran -
domisation, precluding conclusions about effectiveness 
of the adapted PAP intervention. Another limiting fac -
tor is the small sample size in study 3, which may make 
the study underpowered and limit generalisability of 
the results to a larger population.
