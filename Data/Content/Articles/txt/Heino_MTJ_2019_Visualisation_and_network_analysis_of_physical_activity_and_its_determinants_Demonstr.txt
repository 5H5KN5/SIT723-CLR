ABSTRACT
Background: Visualisations and readily-accessible web-based
supplementary ﬁles can improve data reporting and transparency.
In this paper, we make use of recent developments in software
and psychological network analysis to describe the baseline
cohort of a trial testing the Let ’s Move It intervention, which
aimed to increase physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary
behaviours (SB) among vocational school students.
Methods: At baseline, 1166 adolescents, distributed across 6 school
clusters and four educational tracks, completed measures of PA and
SB, theoretical predictors of these behaviours, and body composition.Within a comprehensive website supplement, which includes all
code and analyses, data were tabulated and visualised, and
network analyses explored relations between predictor variables
and outcomes.
Results: Average daily moderate-to-vigorous PA was 65 min (CI95:
57min –73 min), and SB 8h44 min (CI95: 8h04min –9h24 min), with
25.8 (CI95: 23.5 –28.0) interruptions to sitting. Cluster randomisation
appeared to result in balanced distributions for baselinecharacteristics between intervention and control groups, but
diﬀerences emerged across the four educational tracks. Self-reported
behaviour change technique (BCT) use was low for many but not all
techniques. A network analysis revealed direct relationships between
PA and behavioural experiments, planning and autonomousmotivation, and several BCTs were connected to PA via autonomous
motivation. Visualisation uncovered a case of Simpson ’s paradox.
Conclusions: Data-visualisation and data exploration techniques (e.g.
network analysis) can help reveal the dynamics involved in complex
multi-causal systems –a challenging task with traditional data
presentations. The bene ﬁts of presenting complex data visually
should encourage researchers to publish extensive analyses andARTICLE HISTORY

Background
Declining physical activity (PA) and increasing sedentary behaviour (SB) are costly and
growing concerns for public health, especially among individuals with low socioeconomicstatus (SES) (Dieleman et al., 2018 ; Elgar et al., 2015 ). Patterns of low PA among adults
begin earlier in the life course, with evidence that declines in PA and increases in SB
begin during childhood and adolescence (Husu, Vähä-Ypyä, & Vasankari, 2016 ; Mäkelä
et al., 2016 ). This highlights the need for further research into interventions to improve
PA and SB among adolescents.
As adolescents spend a signi ﬁcant amount of their time in schools, the school setting pro-
vides valuable opportunities for PA and SB interventions (van Sluijs et al., 2008). The Let ’s
Move It intervention aimed to reduce SB and in crease PA among adolescents in vocational
schools, and was developed using stakeholder i nput and co-creation with target group repre-
sentatives, as well as theories and empirical evidence from behavioural science (Hankonen,Heino, Kujala, et al., 2017; Hynynen et al., 2016). Contrary to typical s chool-based interven-
tions with relatively homogeneous participants , this trial was carried out in vocational schools
with distinct and varied educational tracks (i .e. practical nurse, business information and
communication technology, busi ness administration, and hotel, restaurant and catering).
Understanding the implications of these distinct tracks on the way participants engage in
both PA and SB will support a better understandi ng of the individual and contextual deter-
minants of behaviour and more informed interpr etations of the results obtained in the trial.
The hypothesised programme theories (Moore et al., 2015 ; Rogers, 2008 ) for changing
PA and SB di ﬀered from one another. In order to increase PA, one needs to make a con-
scious e ﬀort and implement self-regulatory skills (e.g. action planning and overcoming
barriers to PA) to make optimal use of opportunities. The Let ’s Move it intervention
places a particular emphasis on helping adolescents understand and use techniques to
manage their motivation and behaviour (see also Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen, et al.(2017 ) and Hankonen ( 2018 )). To date, there is little knowledge about how the use of
these techniques links to each other, and it would be important to examine these links
empirically. The theoretical model for changing SB, on the other hand, is more drivenby environmental opportunities, such as having the option to stand up during class.
In order to increase moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA, the Let ’s Move It intervention
targeted several behavioural determinants, including behavioural beliefs (outcome expec-tations, descriptive norms, intention, self-e ﬃcacy/perceived behavioural control), auton-
omous and controlled motivation, environmental opportunities, action and coping270 M. T. J. HEINO ET AL.
planning, and behaviour change technique (BCT) use. Key hypotheses regarding students ’
PA change have been registered in OSF ( https://osf.io/tb8fu/ ). To reduce total SB and
introduce breaks in SB, the programme aimed to change the school environment by train-ing teachers in the use of active teaching techniques and altering physical choice architec-ture in classrooms (Köykkä et al., 2018 ). The intervention also included poster campaigns
in schools, a website, and materials to target community actors and parents (Köykkä et al.,
2018 ). More information of the content of the intervention and the development of it is
reported elsewhere (Hankonen et al., 2016 ; Hankonen, Absetz, & Araujo-Soares, 2019 ;
Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen, et al., 2017 ).
It has long been a standard recommendation for quantitative analyses to investigate
data visually as a core precursor of conducting statistical analyses (Cleveland, 1993 ;
Tukey, 1977 ). However, in social and life sciences, such visualisations are rarely shared
in publications. Information about data are usually limited to means and standard devi-ations, which presents at best limited information about the variables of interest
(Traﬁmow, Wang, & Wang, 2018 ). Medians, modes, skewness and kurtosis provide
helpful additional information, but human cognition places limits on evaluating these stat-istics simultaneously, especially when comparing groups of observations. For example, twodistributions can have di ﬀerent means but the same mode, di ﬀerent modes but the same
mean, or the same mean and standard deviation but a meaningful skew. Summary stat-
istics conventionally calculated from the data leave important distributional propertiesuncovered, as illustrated in recent discussions on the inadequacy of bar plots (Saxon,
2015 ; Weissgerber, Garovic, Savic, Winham, & Milic, 2016 ; Weissgerber, Milic,
Winham, & Garovic, 2015 ).
Data visualisations are crucial supplements to large numerical tables of descriptive stat-
istics (Tay, Parrigon, Huang, & LeBreton, 2016 ). With visualisations, researchers can com-
municate large amounts of information –including the associated uncertainty –in an
accessible format, without requiring extensive mathematical expertise from the reader.This is important for researchers who intend to build on previous results (Chalmers &
Glasziou, 2009 ). Such practices may reduce problems that have led to the recent loss of
conﬁdence in the reproducibility and replicability of research ﬁndings (Gigerenzer,
2018 ; Kepes & McDaniel, 2013 ; Nosek, Ebersole, DeHaven, & Mellor, 2018 ; Nosek,
Spies, & Motyl, 2012 ; Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011 ; Smaldino & McElreath,
2016 ). Fully open data sharing would be ideal, but this is not always possible due to
privacy concerns (Expert Advisory Group on Data Access, 2015 ) and, at the time of
writing, remains a lamentably rare practice (Vanpaemel, Vermorgen, Deriemaecker, &
Storms, 2015 ). In addition, open data does not necessarily accommodate stakeholders
with low technical expertise in data analysis and visualisation, such as clinicians, patients
and policy makers; see Hallgren, McCabe, King, and Atkins ( 2018 ), p. 2.
Three recent developments give impetus to a new approach. First, many journals now
allow publication of supplementary online materials, which circumvents both word andﬁgure restrictions of traditional manuscripts. Second, statistical software such as R (R
Core Team, 2015 ) has recently become increasingly mainstream among applied research-
ers, with many free tutorials available online, opening the door for a variety of data visu-alisation techniques. Third, novel statistical methods in social and health psychology, such
as psychological network analysis, may help to understand relationships between variables
by making better use of visual representations of associations.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 271
The aims of this paper are to describe central characteristics of the Let ’s Move It trial
baseline cohort, focusing on co-primary outcomes and other activity measures (as
measured by accelerometry) of the trial both arms, genders and educational tracks inboth trial arms. A further aim is to describe psychological and social correlates, as wellas hypothesised determinants of the intervention ’seﬀect on moderate-to-vigorous PA
(MVPA), with detailed visualisations of the dataset provided in an extensive supplemen-
tary website. As a sub-aim, we also investigate the network of relationships betweenMVPA, quality of motivation and BCT use at baseline. We provide all code as open
source scripts, so that other researchers can use those scripts as templates to visualise
their own datasets in a format that requires no special skills or tools to view.
Methods
This study analyses baseline data from a cluster-randomised controlled trial testing Let ’s
Move It, a complex whole-school system multi-level intervention conducted in Finnish
vocational schools. Details of the Let ’s Move It trial have been described in the study pro-
tocol (Hankonen et al., 2016 ). At baseline, consenting participants in both intervention
and control groups answered an electronic survey, underwent bioimpedance measure-
ments and were instructed to wear an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. The base-line data collection started in January 2015 and ended in April 2016.
Six school units were included in the study. There were four educational tracks in the
schools from which students were recruited: 1. Practical Nurse (Nur), 2. Hotel, Restaurantand Catering (HRC), 3. Business and Administration (BA), and 4. Information and Com-munications Technology (IT). Schools were paired so that there would be matching
numbers of students from each educational track for both members of the pair. Blinded
randomisation by a statistician was then conducted so that a random member of eachpair was selected as intervention school, the other as control school (details reported in
Hankonen et al. ( 2016 )). Student participants provided informed consent and were
blind to allocation at baseline.
All conducted analyses and visualisations with accompanying code, can be found in the
supplementary website at https://git.io/fNHuf (permalink at Heino and Sund ( 2019 )), pre-
viously piloted in (Heino, Knittle, Haukkala, Vasankari, & Hankonen, 2018 ). Source code

Measures
The measures are presented brie ﬂy, as they have been previously described in Hankonen
et al. ( 2016 ), and all individual items of the scales are available in the supplementary
website (see section https://git.io/fjfLw ).
Primary outcome variables of the trial
In the LMI trial, there were multiple primary outcomes. The primary outcome for PA was
moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), measured by accelerometry and self-reports. Primary out-comes for sedentary behaviour (SB) were measured by accelerometry; they included timespent sitting or lying down, and the number of times sitting was interrupted during the day.272 M. T. J. HEINO ET AL.
Self-reported MVPA. Self-reported MVPA was measured with two questions in accordance
with the NordPAQ measurement (Fagt et al., 2012). The ﬁrst question asked participants
about the number of days during the last week in which they did more than 30 min ofMVPA, the other probed the overall amount of MVPA (in hours) during the past seven days.
Accelerometer-measured MVPA and SB. No more than seven days after responding to the
questionnaire, students were given an accelerometer to be worn on seven consecutive days.The hip-worn accelerometer (Hookie AM 20, Traxmeet Ltd, Espoo, Finland) using a
digital triaxial acceleration sensor (ADXL345; Analog Devices, Norwood MA) was
attached to a ﬂexible belt and participants were instructed to wear the belt around their
right hip for seven consecutive days during waking hours, except during shower and
other water activities. The acceleration signal was collected at 100 Hz sampling frequency,
±16 g acceleration range and 0.004 g resolution. De ﬁnitions of the parameters are
described in detail in the supplementary website (section https://git.io/fjJNi ).
Theoretical predictors of PA
The determinants postulated by the programme t heory included behavioural beliefs (outcome
expectations, descriptive norms, intention, self-e ﬃcacy/perceived behavioural control), auton-
omous and controlled motivation, opportunitie s, action- and coping planning, and behaviour
change technique (BCT) use. Participants were allowed to skip questions, and scales were com-
puted as means of all items where responses were a vailable. In other words, answering a single
item of a speci ﬁcs c a l es u ﬃced. For the scales, all items, respons e options, descriptive statistics,
as well as information about missing values and estimated reliability coe ﬃcients, are available
in the supplementary website (section https://git.io/fAj0e ); made using R package codebook
(Arslan, in press ) for automatic dataset documentation.
Statistical analysis
We used RStudio (RStudio Team, 2015 ) 1.1.456 running R (Version 3.6.0; R Core Team,
2018 ) for all our analyses and ﬁgures.
In our case (no con ﬁrmatory hypotheses), con ﬁdence intervals are more appropriate to
report than p-values, as they provide readily interpretable values on the same scale as the
original variable, accommodating inferences of practical relevance (Gardner & Altman,
1986 ; Nosek et al., 2018 ; Sterne, 2001 ; Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016 ). Hence, we omit explicit
statistical testing from the tables.
Activity data was explored by utilising 100% stacked bar charts, which are useful when
comparing proportions which add to 100%. MVPA data was, in addition, examined with
augmented raincloud ridge plots to unveil distributional properties. Psychological andsocial determinants were examined with diamond plots (Peters, 2018 ), and heuristic
(here: not taking into account the clustering of the participants into schools and class-
rooms) e ﬀect sizes between means of intervention arms and genders, transformed from
Cohen ’s d to Pearson ’sr .
Psychological network analysis was used to estimate and visualise relations among BCT
use, motivation and MVPA. Such networks contain nodes (variables) and edges (statisticalrelationships between variables). Unlike in social network analysis, the connections are notdirectly observed, but are estimated. We used network models that estimate conditionalHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 273
dependence relations among a set of variables, which can be interpreted similarly to partial
correlations. An edge between two variables implies that they are related after controlling
for all other variables; the absence of an edge implies that the two variables are (con-ditionally) independent.
The Mixed Graphical Model uses regularisation, a procedure that has been shown to
help recover the true network structure in data in case the data were simulated under a
network model (Haslbeck & Waldorp, 2015 ). Regularisation has the goal to avoid estimat-
ing spurious relationships among items (i.e. false positive relations), and results in a par-
simonious network structure. The regularisation technique used here is the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO; Tibshirani ( 2011 )), which shrinks all edges and
sets very small edges to exact zero. A paper that explains LASSO regularisation in network
models in detail can be found elsewhere (Epskamp & Fried, 2018 ).
Network models applied to between-subjects data at one time-point can be useful for
describing health psychological data, as well as facilitating group-level hypothesis gener-
ation regarding which parts of the system are central for a problem at hand (Fried &
Cramer, 2017 ). Identifying these determinants of importance can thus supplement tra-
ditional structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches. SEM usually speci ﬁesdirected
models, usually in an acyclic manner (i.e. disregarding feedback loops). This can be valuable
for con ﬁrmatory modelling in multivariate data when there has been previous work on
understanding putative causal e ﬀects of the involved variables. However, due to model
equivalence —the fact that often many dozen of undirected path models can be ﬁt to the
same data with identical ﬁt (Stelzl, 1986 )—directed models can be challenging to use in
highly multivariate, exploratory cases. All of these equivalent directed models can be sub-sumed into one undirected model, a network model that estimates and visualises the multi-
variate conditional dependence relations highly relevant in health psychological contexts,
where many causal factors contribute to produce e ﬀects in a mutually reinforcing manner.
Network analysis has recently been taken up in many ﬁelds such as social psychology
(Dalege, Borsboom, van Harreveld, Waldorp, & van der Maas, 2017 ,2016 ), personality
(Mõttus & Allerhand, 2017 ), intelligence (Van Der Maas, Kan, Marsman, & Stevenson,
2017 ), psychopathology (Fried et al., 2017 ), and empathy research (Briganti, Kempenaers,
Braun, Fried, & Linkowski, 2018 ), and is beginning to be applied for health behaviours on
a broader scale. Several helpful tutorial papers aimed at empirical researchers are available
(Costantini et al., 2015 ,2019 ; Dalege, Borsboom, van Harreveld, & van der Maas, 2017 ;
Epskamp & Fried, 2018 ; Epskamp, Borsboom, & Fried, 2018 ), and also exist for health psy-
chology context in particular (Hevey, 2018 ).
To ease interpretation of the network analysis, we dichotomised the heavily skewed
controlled motivation variable in such a way that 1 represents answers 3 ( ‘partly true
for me ’) or higher, and 0 the rest. In addition, BCT use variables were dichotomised by
giving 0 if a person reports completely disagreeing with their statements, or neverhaving used the technique, and 1 otherwise. A correlation matrix of the variables canbe found in the supplement ( https://git.io/fhAgk ).
Findings
In this section, we ﬁrst present data in traditional numeric tables, and follow up by aug-
menting them with graphical illustrations. Table 1 shows the main demographic variables274 M. T. J. HEINO ET AL.
of the cohort by educational track. Among 638 intervention arm participants, 80.5% (429/
533) reported having been born in Finland. Among the 528 control arm participants, thepercentage was 88.7% (423/477).
While on average the sample was relatively balanced on boys and girls (43.5% vs.
56.5%), educational tracks were heavily divided by gender: Practical Nurse track hadthe highest amount of girls (82.3%) and IT track lowest (16.0%). Age ranged from 16to 49, with the average age being 18.50. Altogether there were 190 (16%) students who
reported being at least 20 years old.
Table 2 shows summary statistics for primary outcome variables with their intra-class
correlations (ICCs) for class and school (see supplementary website, section https://git.io/
fjIcc, for ICCs of all variables). The ICC can be interpreted as the proportion of the vari-
able’s variance accounted for by group membership.
At baseline, 63.6% students provided at least 4 days with a minimum of 10 h per day of
valid accelerometer data. On average, the participants reported engaging in at least 30 min
of MVPA on 2.80 days a week. Accelerometer data indicated, that girls were as active asboys (mean 65 vs. 67 min). Given that boys are generally more active than girls (Husu,Vähä-Ypyä, et al., 2016 ), this result will be elaborated on below.
To give the reader a richer perspective than from what can be gauged from considering
these summary statistics only, we present the results graphically in Figure 1 . We can seeTable 1. Baseline demographics of educational tracks. Omitted are 24 participants, who reported
‘other ’as their track, as well as 81 participants from whom data is not available. Nur = Practical

that the patterns of average baseline activity, as measured by the accelerometer, are similar
within gender and intervention allocation groups. However, the charts reveal that the ITtrack is more sedentary compared to other tracks and that girls are actually lessactive in
each educational track.
The plot shows the average activity types relative to measurement time, but hides varia-
bility around the averages. The graph does not depict, for example, that while the averageportion of time spent in sedentary behaviour for the IT track was 72.0%, almost half
(42.0%) of that track ’s participants were sedentary more than 75% of the time.
Zooming in on accelerometer-measured MVPA, Table 3 gives us statistics –some of
which more commonly reported, others less so –on the variable.
Figure 2 displays an augmented density plot, representing and elaborating on infor-
mation from Table 3 . The density curves can be read like a histogram, but the shape is
not dependent on the bar width. They also help illustrate di ﬀerences across groups,

revealing potential di ﬀerences in variability and distribution shape. The plot shown pre-
sents raw data below the density curve, to allow the reader to see the data on which thedensity algorithm is based upon. Augmenting the graph with the diamond facilitates infer-
ences based on location of the mean. (Peters, 2018 )
As the diamonds in Figure 2 illustrate, participants who study practical nursing are the
most active, followed by HRC students and BA students, with the IT track being the leastactive. There is considerable variation within tracks though. This explains the gender
diﬀerence in MVPA: the practical nurse track is the largest, and its students, mostly
girls, are the most active. The IT students, mostly boys, are the least active.
In sum, boys did more MVPA in every educational track (mean di ﬀerences in minutes:
12.80 for Practical nurse, 5.40 for Hotel, restaurant and catering, 11.90 for Business and
administration, and 19.90 for IT). In spite of this, girls appear more active in the aggregate.This is also known as the Simpson ’s paradox, and is best investigated by visualising data
(see Kievit, Frankenhuis, Waldorp, and Borsboom ( 2013 ) for an introduction). Examining
the left side of Figure 2 reveals the di ﬀerence between boys and girls in MVPA, the di ﬀer-
ence between Practical nurse and IT tracks, the di ﬀerences in gender composition, and
diﬀerences in the amount of participants in each track. These, when taken together, con-
tribute to a comprehensive understanding of the data.
Similar plots for all primary outcome variables can be found in the supplement. In brief,
regardless of track, boys reported more days with at least 30 min of MVPA, while report-
ing more e.g. gym training, which was more strongly connected to the self-reported
MVPA than the accelerometer-measured one. Accelerometer measurement also indicated,that boys engaged in more sedentary time and interrupted sitting less often than girls (see
supplementary website, sections https://git.io/fjvWv andhttps://git.io/fjvCj ).

Theoretical determinants
InTable 4 below, we present the means for the primary outcome variables by gender and
trial arm.
In 14 of the 18 variables presented here, the mean of the control group is more favour-
able than that of the intervention group (average unadjusted advantage 1.91%). InFigure 3 , the results are visualised in a concise manner.
From the left side of Figure 3 , we can e.g. observe, that SB descriptive norms are
bimodal (observations are clustered in answer options 1 and 4) and thus the means arenot representative of typical participants. In addition, several of the variables are
skewed (e.g. PA intention and PA amotivation), which has implications on analytical
choices as well as interpretations of the mean values. On the right side, the e ﬀect size esti-
mates indicate highest di ﬀerence between genders in SB outcome expectations, and
highest di ﬀerence between treatment arms in PA descriptive norms –the overlap,
though, is large and likely underestimated due to not taking cluster memberships intoaccount (see methods).
Behaviour change technique usage
There were no clear di ﬀerences in frequency-dependent BCT use between genders or arms
(Figure 4 ).
Figure 4 tells that the most frequent response is 1, indicating non-use of that BCT. In
fact, a large number of BCTs seem to indicate a composite distribution, where one popu-
lation reports never using the BCT, and another is seems normally distributed around the
middle of the scale.
The aforementioned forms can also be observed in the distributions of agreement-
dependent BCTs, as presented in Figure 5 .Table 4. Main theoretical determinants of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB). Mean

Demonstration of network analysis
Figure 6 shows a LASSO regularised mixed graphical model of BCT use, motivation and
the two MVPA measures. We can observe, that after taking into account all the othernodes in the network and regularising small connections to zero, autonomous motivation
appears to serve as a link between many BCTs and MVPA. In fact, only having a plan
made by someone else, and having tried out new ways to be physically active (duringthe past three weeks), are directly connected to either of the MVPA nodes. In addition,use of certain BCTs are coupled particularly closely: Comparatively strong links exist

between goal setting and having an own PA plan, between identifying barriers and plan-
ning to overcome them (i.e. problem solving/coping planning), and between goal setting
and an own PA plan (i.e. action planning). We can also see a triad, where re ﬂecting posi-
tive consequences is connected to goal review, through having thought of personal reasonsto do PA, as well as less strongly coupled social support and having made changes to home
environment. Such connections can be understood as variables in ﬂuencing each other, but
can also be indicative of underlying latent variables (i.e. the three variables are causal con-sequences of a shared origin) (Molenaar, 2010 ).
Conclusions
This study investigated the baseline characteristics of the Let ’s Move It trial cohort, making
use of modern tools to visualise key results and exhaustively report the analyses, ﬁndings
and analytical choices made. We found high levels of sedentary behaviour in the sample,
with heterogeneity across educational tracks. MVPA, motivation and BCT use were mod-
elled as a network, which highlighted the relevance of autonomous motivation in associ-ations between PA and BCT use.
In contrast to earlier international and Finnish data collected in the general population
(e.g. Husu, Suni, et al. ( 2016 )), girls performed slightly more PA than boys in this sample.
This is due to the practical nurse track being most active and mostly female; in otherwords, after accounting for track, no meaningful gender di ﬀerences in accelerometer-

measured MVPA could be seen. Further, boys reported doing more MVPA than girls, and
the accelerometer-measurement implied boys were also more sedentary and interruptedsitting less often. Intervention and control groups were similar in their accelerometer-
measured MVPA. This observation supports the decision of pairing educational tracks
in randomisation, such that all tracks were represented in both arms. The practicalnurse track was simultaneously the largest, the most active and had the highest percentageof girls, which means that potential gender di ﬀerences in eventual intervention results
should be interpreted with caution.
To our knowledge, this is one of the ﬁrst studies to measure the use of potential BCTs
comprehensively already at the trial baseline. As can be expected, many people indeed do
use BCTs even before the intervention takes place. The results reveal that in the past three
weeks, many participants report not having used self-regulation related BCTs such asplanning, problem solving or goal setting, which on the other hand have been indicated
to be useful techniques for PA self-management (Michie, Abraham, Whittington,
McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ). To our knowledge, this is also the ﬁrst trial to measure the
use of a range of BCTs among both control and intervention arm participants.
Comprehensive, transparent reporting of results leads to a vast amount of information
to be presented: visual exposition is thus vital. Visualising distributions makes the varia-
bility among study participants more salient, which informs us about the distributionalassumptions that underlie many common statistical techniques. Modern and traditional
approaches to data visualisation also allow us to go further than just comparing means

(Rousselet, Pernet, & Wilcox, 2017 ), and provide opportunities to avoid drawing false con-
clusions (e.g. in the case of Simpson ’s paradox) based on summary statistics alone.
The results of the network analysis highlight, how most naturally used BCTs –exceptions
including having a plan made by someone else, and trying out new forms of PA –possibly
require autonomous motivation to a ﬀect MVPA. This ﬁnding, if corroborated in longitudi-
nal data, would support the theoretical framework of the intervention, which held autonomysupport and behavioural experiments at the forefront. So far, network models have been
largely used as a tool for exploring empirical relationships among variables, often with
little existing theory (Fried et al., 2017; Mõttus & Allerhand, 2017). One could understand
this as the ﬁrst generation of network papers in psychology, and there have been recent calls
for a second generation that is con ﬁrmatory in nature, and based on existing theories of
relationships among biological, psychological and social variables (Fried & Cramer, 2017).
The study also has limitations. It should be noted that while we consider 7-day accel-
erometry (with inclusion criterion of accumulating more than 4 days of over 10 h wear
time) an approximation of a participant ’s true habitual PA and SB in their daily life, it
is not an errorless measure and it does not capture all forms of activity. Additionally,the questionnaire to measure the BCTs requires future validation (Bringmann &
Eronen, 2016 ; Flake & Fried, 2019 ; Hankonen, 2018 ).
In the network model used, regularisation techniques are applied to remove spurious
relations and control for multiple testing (for an in-depth tutorial on such regularised
network models, see Epskamp and Fried ( 2018), and for a health psychology speci ﬁcu s e
case, see Hevey ( 2018)). At the same time, these networks estimate relations that are akin

the conditional dependence relationships between the variables of interest (edges which connectnodes), which can be interpreted akin to partial correlations. Pies depict means as proportion of theor-etical maximum (in the case of accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity(MVPA), mean as proportion of highest observed value); behaviour change technique (BCT) use andcontrolled motivation are dichotomised (see Methods). Node colours distinguish the three types ofnodes; MPVA (blue), motivation (yellow), and BCT use (green).282 M. T. J. HEINO ET AL.
to partial correlations to derive the conditional dependence structure among variables. Poten-
tial pitfalls of these models and their application have been discussed elsewhere in detail (Fried
&C r a m e r , 2017; Guloksuz, Pries, & Van Os, 2017). Most importantly, while in social net-
works one can include all relevant nodes (e.g. all people in a classroom or company), this isnot so in biopsychosocial networks, where the question of what items to include as nodes
remains a challenging question. Relations among items are often interpreted as putative
causal pathways (although many other interpretations exist, Epskamp and Fried ( 2018)),
which means one should not include two variables that are simply two indicators of the
same construct (e.g. the items ‘I often feel sad ’and‘I often feel blue ’). Another important chal-
lenge is that one should avoid statistically controlling for common e ﬀects, also known as col-
liders: If in the true model both A and B independently cause C, C is a collider. If one controls
for C in the model, a negative relation between A and B will emerge where no relation exists in
the true model. This applies to all regression models and network models that are based onregressions, and it can be challenging to determine if a given variable is a collider. Rohrer
(2018) provides an approachable introduction to causal inference in observational data.
The type of supplement used for this manuscript allows for presenting a lot, but not
all, information due to resource considerations. One of the reader groups not fully con-sidered are researchers and educators, who wish to use these data to guide intervention
design. We would like to point out that the results, like most of the research in the area,
only provide a group-level snapshot of a wide variety of constantly unfolding dynamicprocesses. Few individual participants are described by the group-level summary stat-
istics: In fact, using Daniels ’(Daniels, 1952 )d eﬁnition of an ‘approximately average
individual ’as falling in the middle 30% of the range of values, only 1.50% of partici-
pants can be considered ‘average ’on all of the primary outcome measures (see sup-
plementary website, section https://git.io/fpOy1 ). Intervention designers looking at
this cohort to choose to-be-targeted determinants for their study may want to considerapplying clustering techniques on the data once it becomes publicly available. Still, andespecially when processes are considered, group-level data does not inform the individ-
ual-level mechanisms of action in the case of non-ergodic systems, and hence the agree-
ment between features of these two levels should be investigated (Fisher, Medaglia, &Jeronimus, 2018 ).
In conclusion, this analysis of baseline data from the Let ’s Move It intervention trial
indicates that randomisation did not result in highly disproportionate groups, i.e. thediﬀerences between arms were small –although, in the case of complex systems, even
minimal di ﬀerences may proliferate and lead to group imbalances (Rickles, 2009 ). It
also highlights that vocational school students di ﬀer in many regards by their chosen edu-
cational track. Finally, graphical methods of presenting descriptive data are an important
addition to traditional tables displaying means and standard deviations, which are most
informational for symmetric distributions. Conventional approaches would have e.g.left the reader with an impression that the means of the multimodal or skewed variablesare interpretable as central tendencies, and that the sample is homogenous. Transparent
and accessible sharing of data characteristics, analyses and analytical choices is imperative
for increasing con ﬁdence in research ﬁndings.
In the past, adopting methods such as the ones presented here, have come with large
barriers to entry. Nowadays, with increased access to learning resources (such as
code.org, khanacademy.org or datacamp.com), the increased appreciation of codingHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 283
(Bers, 2017 ), as well as technology ’s rising role in minimising research errors (Rouder,
Haaf, & Snyder, 2018 ) and facilitating collaboration (Pain, 2018 ), these barriers are
being torn down. Hence, we are con ﬁdent that approaches such as this will become
easier to adopt for the research community in the coming years. In high-quality RCTswith pre-speci ﬁed outcomes, the exploratory data analysis techniques presented here
have a role in detecting unintended e ﬀects commonly observed in complex systems
(Moore et al., 2019 ). In such trials, the graphical representation of data retains its impor-
tance in conveying information, which promotes non-dichotomous thinking about stat-
istical signi ﬁcance tests or con ﬁdence intervals (Amrhein, Greenland, & McShane, 2019 ;
Mayo, 2018 , p. 10), and elaborate supplements can act as a platform to present robustness
tests and assumption explorations in.
