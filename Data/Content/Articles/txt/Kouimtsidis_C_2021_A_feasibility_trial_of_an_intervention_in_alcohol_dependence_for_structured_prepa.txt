Abstract
Background: Individuals who are ‘moderately ’or ‘severely ’dependent consume alcohol at levels that are likely to
have a severe impact on their own health and mortality, the health and behaviours of others (family members) and
to have economic and social implications. Treatment guidelines suggest that treatment needs to be planned with
medically assisted withdrawal (also referred to as detoxification), and aftercare support but outcomes are poor with
low proportions engaging in after care and high relapse rates. An approach of structured preparation before
alcohol detoxification (SPADe) puts an emphasis on introducing lifestyle changes, development of coping strategies
for cravings, stress and emotions as well as introducing changes to the immediate family and social environment in
advance of alcohol cessation. Such a pre-habilitation paradigm compliments the established treatment approach.
The key research question was: can we design a large scale, randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will answer
whether such an approach is more effective than usual care in helping individuals to maintain longer periods of
alcohol abstinence?
Methods: This is a pragmatic, parallel, two-arm, feasibility RCT comparing SPADe and usual care against usual care
only in maintaining alcohol abstinence in adults with alcohol dependence receiving care in two community
addiction services in London. Feasibility outcomes, exploration of primary and secondary clinical outcomes and
health economic outcomes are analysed. The trial follows the guidelines of phase 2 of the Medical Research
Council (MRC) for complex interventions.
Results: We were able to recruit 48/50 participants during a period of 9 months. Retention in the trial for the
whole period of the 12 months was 75%. Treatment compliance was overall 44%. Data completion for the primary
outcome was 65%, 50% and 63% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. The intervention group had more days
abstinent in the previous 90 days at the 12 months ( n= 54.5) versus control ( n= 41.5).

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15What uncertainties regarding feasibility existed prior
to the study? In 2005 in the UK, an innovative
group intervention for preparation before alcohol
detoxification, based on CBT Relapse Prevention
interventions, developed by members of the research
team, reduced dropouts during the detoxification
process and improved outcomes at 1, 3 months and
6 months. Qualitative evidence found that ‘regaining
control ’was the main learning point across all group
sessions of the programme. However, these findings
were from small naturalistic studies. Evidence was
required on whether structured preparation before
detoxification rather than detoxification alone
improves short- and long-term treatment outcomes
and therefore whether the whole treatment para-
digm should shift.
/C15What are the key findings on feasibility from this
study? The rate of recruitment was higher when the
research assistants were on site, which was
supported by the qualitative interviews of staff.
Retention in the trial for the whole period of the 12
months was 75%, indicating strong acceptability in
the study population. Treatment compliance was
overall 44%, which is considered acceptable for a
population attending addiction services. Data
completion for the primary outcome was 65%, 50%
and 63% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively, with
more follow-ups taking place over the phone.
/C15What are the implications of the findings on the
design of the main study? In a future RCT, we
would randomise individuals at a later point once
they are retained in the service for a brief period and
so demonstrating some clear commitment to
treatment. Furthermore, the intervention should be
better standardised with the expectation that
participants attend consecutive weekly sessions,
within a maximum period of 12 weeks. Missed
sessions would be offered by one of the facilitators
on an individual basis. Most importantly there
would be more enhanced communication and
cooperation between key workers and group
facilitators for a pro-active and more effective man-
agement of participants at risk of dropping out.Support of group facilitators should be allocated to
local supervisors to increase hands-on support, to
reduce contamination between the intervention and
usual care.
Background
Harmful use of alcohol continues to be a global health
problem and tackling the impact of harmful and
dependent drinking is a key global public health priority.
Global estimates suggest that one in five adults report at
least one occasion of heavy drinking in the past month
[1]. Individuals who are ‘moderately ’or‘severely ’
dependent consume alcohol at levels that are likely to
have a severe impact on their own health and mortality,
the health and behaviours of others (family members)
and to have economic and social implications [ 2]. In the
UK, hospital admissions attributable to alcohol in 2017 –
2018 remained similar to the previous year (338,000).
However, this is 15% higher than 10 years ago [ 3]. Alco-
hol misuse is linked directly to a range of health disor-
ders. Cancer, accidental injuries and mental health
problems remain the main alcohol directly related diag-
nosis leading to a hospital admission [ 3]. More than
5000 individuals died directly from alcohol use in 2016
in the UK, which is 6% higher than 2011 [ 3]. However,
in the year 2018 –2019, in the UK those in treatment for
alcohol alone neither increased nor decreased on the
previous year. This follows large year-on-year declines
from a peak of 91,651 in 2013 to 2014 [ 4].
Treatment guidelines in the UK for moderate to severe
alcohol dependence have largely remained the same for
the past decade. They suggest that treatment needs to be
planned, with up to four motivational sessions focusing
on treatment engagement and development of aftercare
support, followed by medically assisted withdrawal (also
referred to as detoxification), and finally aftercare sup-
port, which should include pharmacological treatments,
psychological treatments and access to self-help inter-
ventions and support [ 2]. Benzodiazepines are normally
prescribed during detoxification to reduce the overt
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (sweating, tremor) as
well as prevent potentially life-threatening complications
(e.g. convulsions, delirium tremens) [ 2]. However, these
drugs do not prevent alcohol craving, relapse back into
alcohol consumption and other long-term effects onKouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 2 of 14
mental functioning [ 2,5]. Outcomes from detoxification
are often poor with low proportions engaging in after
care [ 6] and are associated with high relapse rates [ 2].
There is accumulating evidence from animal and human
studies that exposure to multiple detoxifications is asso-
ciated with cognitive and behaviour changes in tasks in-
dicating impairment in conflict resolution, i.e. what
alcohol dependent individuals experience when there is
a conflict between the intention to abstain from drinking
and the desire to drink. In addition, those individuals
show an increased sensitivity to stress and heightened
craving. Together, these factors may contribute to re-
lapse and might compromise the effectiveness of after-
care support [ 7–12].
In the light of the evidence indicating risks associated
with detoxification, one potential approach to maximise
effectiveness of each detoxification may be following a
pre-habilitation treatment approach that compliments
the established treatment and rehabilitation approach.
Such an enhanced paradigm considers and plans for the
management of the risks associated with detoxification
as well as the risk factors associated with relapse. Such
an approach involving structured preparation puts em-
phasis on introducing lifestyle changes, development of
coping strategies for cravings, stress and emotions and
introduces changes to the immediate family and social
environment in advance of alcohol cessation. There is
currently no guidance specifically on preparation for the
detoxification process apart from general guidance on
care coordination and case management [ 2]. Absence of
specific guidance reflects the lack of developed interven-
tions in this area. Evidence is required on whether struc-
tured preparation along the lines of pre-habilitation
principles before detoxification rather than detoxifica-
tion alone improves short- and long-term treatment out-
comes and therefore whether the whole treatment
paradigm should shift. Before embarking on a full trial
of the effectiveness of such a structured preparation,
there is a need to undertake a feasibility study to estab-
lish key parameters that influence trial design such as re-
cruitment, adherence to the intervention, retention, and
sensitivity of alternative outcome measures.
A literature search of PubMed Central using alcohol
relapse prevention treatment-related MeSH terms
undertaken in June 2014, found (i) that group interven-
tions with diverse theoretical bases are considered to be
more cost-effective than one-to-one interventions; and
(ii) cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) relapse preven-
tion interventions are well supported by evidence [ 13].
In 2005 in the UK, an innovative group intervention for
preparation before alcohol detoxification, based on CBT
relapse prevention interventions, developed by members
of the research team, reduced dropouts during the de-
toxification process [ 6,14] and improved outcomes at 1,3 months and 6 months [ 15]. However, these findings
were from small naturalistic studies. Qualitative evidence
found that ‘regaining control ’was the main learning
point across all group sessions of the programme [ 16].
This feasibility study builds on the above preliminary
evidence by refining the preparatory intervention and
assessing the feasibility of conducting a large-scale evalu-
ation (Structured Preparation before Alcohol Detoxifica-
tion: SPADe) for individuals with moderate to severe
alcohol dependence, as an adjunct to usual care, consist-
ing of planned detoxification and aftercare.
The intervention under investigation in this study is
based on Plans, Responses, Impulses, Motives, Evalua-
tions (PRIME) theory of motivation [ 17] and Social
Learning theory [ 18]. PRIME theory is a synthetic theory
of motivation from conscious decision-making through
to classical and instrumental learning processes. The
theory understands the motivation system as a system of
forces and operates at five levels of complexity. Any of
these can function abnormally in addiction. As a person
moves from reflex responses, through impulses, then
motives and evaluations, greater flexibility of responding,
consideration of a wider range of factors and anticipa-
tion of future consequences are allowed. At the highest
level, plans allow action sequences to be prepared in ad-
vance of the circumstances when they are needed. This
is consistent with the overall pre-habilitation approach
that aims to prepare people to cope with life after the re-
moval of alcohol. Social learning theory introduces the
concept of self-efficacy that underlies the use of psycho-
logical interventions aiming to reverse the development
of automatised behaviour and associated loss of control,
such as CBT relapse prevention interventions. The inter-
vention combines the long established (in alcohol treat-
ment) ethos of group intervention, and follows the
biological principle of homeostasis, which is disturbed
with prolonged alcohol use [ 19], to help individuals re-
gain control over their drinking as the first step towards
lifelong sustainable abstinence.
Methods
Aim
The key research question was: can we design a large
scale, randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will answer
whether the SPADe intervention is more effective than
usual care in helping adults to maintain longer periods
of alcohol abstinence? The feasibility trial compared the
use of SPADe with usual care against usual care alone in
two sites and enabled us to do the following:
1. Measure the number of eligible participants, willing-
ness of clinicians to recruit participants, recruitment
rate, loss to follow-up, adherence to the intervention and
standard deviation of the primary outcome measures.Kouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 3 of 14
This will ultimately inform the sample size calculation
for a multicentre clinical trial.
2. Determine the acceptability of randomisation to ser-
vice users, through its effect on recruitment, dropout
rates and via qualitative interviews.
3. Determine the appropriateness and the acceptability
of the outcome measures to participants to explore the
suitability of our chosen primary and secondary outcome
measures; percentage of days abstinent, service use and
health-related quality of life.
4. Estimate the time needed to collect and analyse
baseline and outcome data.
5. Explore the utility of the health-related quality of
life instrument (EQ-5D-5L) (see outcome measures
below) in allowing the estimation of quality adjusted life
years in the sample, as well as exploring other aspects of
cost-effectiveness assessment.
Reduction in subjective measures of alcohol depend-
ence and craving as well as improvement in objective
measures of mental functioning were also explored.
Finally, we have conducted qualitative interviews with
participants and service providers, to assess the accept-
ability of the treatment and to explore their experience
of the treatment including any barriers and/or facilita-
tors to taking part in the study. Findings from these in-
terviews will enable us to refine the SPADe intervention
and the design of the future definitive RCT.
Design
The study design is reported in detail elsewhere [ 20].
This is a parallel, two-arm, feasibility RCT comparing
the clinical and cost-effectiveness of SPADe and usual
care, against usual care only, in maintaining alcohol ab-
stinence in adults with alcohol dependence receiving
care in the community. The trial followed phase 2 Med-
ical Research Council (MRC) guidelines for complex in-
terventions [ 21] and includes adaptation of the
intervention, feasibility study including health economics
and process evaluation.
Setting
Participants were recruited from specialist alcohol com-
munity services offering recovery orientated treatment
for individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Re-
cruitment took place in two sites in London, both offer-
ing the intervention and usual care, to explore
challenges associated with implementation of the inter-
vention across two different treatment services. Both
sites were run by a partnership between a third sector
organisation and the National Health Service (NHS), a
common funding model in the UK. The two sites had
different integration levels; site 1 was fully integrated
with a single management and clinical governance sys-
tem; site 2 had two parallel systems. Notably, site 1 hadbeen offering the intervention for several years as part of
the standard treatment pathway, whereas in site 2 the
intervention had to be added to the clinical pathway.
This meant that in site 1 those randomised to control
did not follow the established local treatment pathway
but were provided with ‘usual care ’as provided else-
where in London.
Participants
Inclusion criteria
1. Presentation to either of the two alcohol services in
London, Hounslow (site 1) and Camden (site 2)
seeking abstinence from alcohol.
2. Alcohol dependence (moderate to severe), scoring
16 and above on Severity of Alcohol Dependence
Questionnaire (SADQ) (see outcome measures
below). This level of dependence indicates that it
would be clinically appropriate to receive a
medically assisted detoxification [ 2].
3. Stated intention to stay in the area within the time
period of the intervention.
4. Willingness to be part of a group intervention if
randomised to receive it.
Exclusion criteria
1. Age less than 18 (as not usually treated by specialist
alcohol services).
2. Pregnancy: pregnant women need urgent
intervention to withdraw from alcohol, due to the
effect of alcohol on the foetus.
3. Known terminal illness with life expectancy of less
than 6 months.
4. Severe medical condition that requires urgent
medical admission, which would lead to an
unplanned medically assisted withdrawal.
5. Severe cognitive impairment that compromises
capacity and/or ability to participate in a group
intervention.
6. Acute stage of a severe and enduring mental illness
(schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, recurrent
depressive disorder: current episode severe), when
acute symptomatology compromises a service user ’s
ability to participate in a group intervention.
Assessments
Participant assessments were conducted at baseline and
at 3, 6 and 12 months by the research assistants who
were trained in assessing capacity and obtaining consent,
administering the questionnaires and interviewing par-
ticipants. A window of 2 weeks either side of assessment
time points was allocated to maximise engagement with
follow up.Kouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 4 of 14
Feasibility measures
Feasibility outcomes were (I) recruitment and retention
rates: monthly monitoring of the number of alcohol
dependent individuals accessing services during the re-
cruitment period of the study; how many meet the eligi-
bility criteria; and how many were invited and accepted
into the study and retained in each group for the full 12
months. (II) Compliance with treatment: number of
SPADe sessions attended (for the intervention arm)
using the facilitator ’s record of attendance. (III) Data
collection and completeness: attendance for assessments
and completeness of instruments; loss to follow up and
missing data for all outcomes were analysed.
A variety of possible outcomes were used at each time
point (3, 6 and 12 months post randomisation), so the
primary outcome for the future trial could be identified
and sample size calculations to be conducted, including
duration of continuous abstinence with no incidents of
lapse or relapse; percentage of days of abstinence (PDA)
(both via self-report using Time Line Follow Back
method) (TLFB) [ 22]; and time to relapse (from stopping
alcohol to first day of alcohol use; also as defined by
self-report).
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes were measured using validated in-
struments at 3-, 6- and 12-month post randomisation:
1. Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire
(SADQ), a 20-item self-completion questionnaire, scores
range 0 to 60, (16 to 29 indicates moderate severity,
above 30 indicates severe dependence) [ 23].
2. Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), an eight-item
self-completion questionnaire containing three domains of
drinking urges: desire for a drink; expectation of positive ef-
fect from drinking; inability to avoid drinking, with a score
range from 7 to 56. Responses are scored on a Likert-type
scale ranging from 1 (strong ly disagree) to 7 (strongly
agree), according to how the participant is feeling currently,
with a higher score indicating more severe urges [ 24].
3. Incentive Conflict Task (ICT). ICT is a newly devel-
oped task which models contributors to relapse (inher-
ent conflict in abstaining drinkers between the intention
to abstain from drinking, and the desire to drink). The
ICT requires participants to abstain from responding
during presentation of a novel compound stimulus (AB)
predicting lack of reward made up of two visual cues
that the participant has previously learned to signal re-
ward availability when presented separately (A or B
alone). The task requires the participant to respond for
the monetary reward, but to withhold responding under
conditions in which an increased size of reward might
be anticipated (A and B together), but no reward follows.
Data are presented as percentage of trials to which par-
ticipants responded (pressed a key; Table 2). In otherwords, ICT engages both bottom-up triggers of reward
seeking, and the top-down processes that normally
modulate and veto responses to such triggers. We have
suggested that the task creates a conflict between
abstaining and responding for reward similar to that ex-
perienced by the participants before relapse, and that the
impaired ability of multiple-detoxified participants to
perform the task accurately reflects the consequences of
detoxification on top-down control of their behaviour
[9]. Alcohol-dependent people, as they experience suc-
cessive detoxifications and their alcohol dependence in-
creases, become increasingly impaired in performing the
ICT [ 25].
4. EQ-5D-5L, an improved version of EQ-5D-3L by
Euro-Qol Group [ 26], is a generic preference-based
measure of health- related quality of life that is widely
used in health economic evaluations. The descriptive
system questionnaire comprises five dimensions: mobil-
ity, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anx-
iety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe
problems and extreme problems. It was administered
with other outcome instruments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12
months. We translated the EQ-5D-5L scores into value
sets using Delvin et al. ’s approach [ 27]. Scores from EQ-
5D-5L provide a standardised unit of measurement —the
quality adjusted life year (QALY) —for use in economic
evaluations [ 28].
5. Self-reported participation in aftercare activities,
using a specifically developed log, measuring type and
frequency of activity attended, during the period prior
the follow-up interview at each follow-up point.
Process evaluation —treatment fidelity
Observation of 25% of the intervention sessions offered
across both recruitment sites using a modified version of
the Yale Adherence and Competence Scale version II
(YACS II) (2005) was planned [ 29]. YACS II is a widely
used tool that assesses both the frequency/intensity
(quantity) and how well CBT techniques (quality) are
used in a session, with a score from 1 to 7, with 4 con-
sidered as acceptable. Furthermore, 10% of the interven-
tion sessions were planned to be rated by an additional
independent rater using YACS II. Additionally, group fa-
cilitators were asked to complete a self-assessment form
following each session to reflect on their fidelity to the
intervention manual. The latter was not completed (see
‘Results ’section).
Audio recording and rating of 25% of the key-working
sessions offered to the usual care group was also
planned, to assess possible contamination between the
study arms, using a specifically developed form based on
YACS II items and the main objectives of the SPADe
group intervention. The aim was to detect presence ofKouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 5 of 14
CBT or elements of the intervention within the usual
care key working sessions. A low score indicates no
presence of specific CBT content and no contamination.
The treatment fidelity assessment exercise was particu-
larly important for site 1, where the intervention had
already been implemented previously as part of the local
treatment pathway.
Interventions tested
SPADe
The intervention provides structured group preparation
(additional to usual care) with the aim of helping partici-
pants (i) regain partial control over their drinking prior
to detoxification and (ii) initiate lifestyle changes for the
individual and the immediate family environment. These
changes are linked with developing new coping skills
and enhanced self-efficacy [ 30].
The six sessions are numbered and offered weekly in a
given order. Stabilisation of alcohol consumption and
pattern of drinking is a common theme across all the
sessions. To that effect each session can act as an entry
point (i.e. an open rolling programme group), despite
the special theme covered in depth during the second
part of the session. Each session has two facilitators, lasts
for one hour and is divided into three parts:
/C15In the first part (15 min), group rules are
established, new members are introduced, as are the
aims of the intervention. In-between sessions ’prac-
tice allocated in the previous session where individ-
ual targets were set are also reviewed.
/C15The second part (30 min, main part) explores the
following themes depending on session number:
1—Understanding habit, addiction and alcohol
dependence; 2 —Stabilise and control your drinking;
3—Lifestyle changes for you and the people around
you; 4 —Reduction of your drinking; 5 —Achieving
abstinence; 6 —Relapse prevention strategies. In each
session, collaborative activities were completed by
the group with facilitators ’support.
/C15In the third part (15 min), the group summarises
the main learning points and agrees in-between ses-
sions ’practice and targets to be achieved before the
next session. A group work folder was provided for
participants which enabled notes and worksheets to
be kept together.
The number of participants per group at any point is
between two and eight. This is considered appropriate
for theory-based treatment groups, to (i) reach a balance
between the educational and treatment elements of the
intervention, (ii) promote interactions between group
members (group therapeutic effect) and (iii) secure the
facilitator ’s attention to each member individually [ 31].The intervention manual is available online [ 32]. Partici-
pants allocated to the intervention arm entered detoxifi-
cation at the first available opportunity following
completion of the intervention.
Usual care
Usual care includes planning for detoxification, detoxifi-
cation delivery and aftercare conducted in one-to-one
keywork appointments. Participants entered detoxifica-
tion at the first available opportunity (expected to be
within 4 weeks from presentation). Whilst waiting for
detoxification, they meet their keyworker on 3 –4 occa-
sions to maintain motivation and plan aftercare.
Detoxification was medically assisted in the community
as an outpatient (both sites), or inpatient (only for site 1), as
clinically indicated. The choice depended on health risk fac-
tors and availability of social support during detoxification
[2]. Participants allocated to Intervention could achieve
abstinence by Guided Self-Detox which refers to gradual re-
duction of drinking guided by the group facilitator during
the intervention period. As mentioned above, aftercare (fol-
lowing detoxification) included a relapse prevention group,
a small number of individual key worker sessions (4 –6s e s -
sions), pharmacological interventions as appropriate peer
support groups such as Self-Management and Recovery
Training (SMART) Recovery or Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA) or more comprehensive aftercare group programme
either as an outpatient (both sites) and inpatient (only
site 1).
Participants in both intervention and control groups
received all the elements of usual care available in the
recruiting service. At any time during the trial, change of
clinical needs or risks were monitored by the clinical
team and participant ’s treatment plan was modified ac-
cordingly, e.g. urgent hospital admission. These inci-
dents were monitored and reported as per standard
ethical recommendations for safety monitoring. Each
participant ’s care pathway was recorded and analysed for
variability within and between sites as part of the eco-
nomic evaluation (see below), to ensure these were
equivalent across trial arms.
Statistical and health economic analysis
The main analysis was planned to be based on the
intention-to-treat principle considering all randomised
clients according to the arm they were allocated.
The feasibility outcomes were summarised using de-
scriptive statistics where appropriate. The potential pri-
mary and secondary outcomes were summarised by arm,
as well as completion rates estimated for each outcome
measure. Duration of continuous abstinence, as mea-
sured from randomisation, and the time to relapse, as
measured from the end of the detoxification. Formal hy-
pothesis tests and confidence intervals have not beenKouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 6 of 14
reported due to the nature of this trial as the focus was
on the completion rate of outcomes, and the estimation
of parameters required for a sample size calculation for
the main trial.
Economic evaluation in the feasibility study tested the
collection of data on costs and outcomes that would be re-
quired in any future definitive trial assessing the cost effect-
iveness of the SPADe intervention. Data gathered on the
resources-use involved the delivery of the intervention and
on service use by participants over the 12-month period of
the study. Clinic contacts wit h key workers, nurses, and
doctors for delivering the intervention and usual care were
obtained retrospectively at 3, 6 and 12 months from clinic
records by research assistants . The records covered all par-
ticipants ’contacts including face-to-face and by phone with
health professionals. For those in the intervention group,
the clinic records included attendances at the detoxification
preparation sessions. These c ontacts were subsequently
separated out as part of the analysis, in order to assess com-
pliance and isolate other service use. To assess potential
service use offsets, data on other service utilisation by par-
ticipants was gathered by self-report using the Client Ser-
vice Receipt Inventory. The CSRI was administered to
participants by researchers in the clinic at 3, 6 and 12
months. The questionnaire covers all forms of health and
social care and includes contact s with the police and justice
services [ 33]. The data on contacts with health and social
care professionals and service-use were converted to costs
by multiplying contacts by nationally validated unit costs
(which include on costs and fac ilities and managerial over-
heads) in British pounds 2018 [ 34] .T h e s ed a t af r o mc l i n i c
records included the duration of contacts (in minutes)
which were used for the cost calculation. Unit costs for
legal services and police contacts were obtained from the
Home Office and related sources [ 35].
Qualitative interviews
A purposive sample of participants across both trial
groups and sites (approximately 20) were planned to be
interviewed at 3 months to establish experiences of ran-
domisation, recruitment and initial trial procedures
(wave 1) and follow up interviews were planned to take
place at 9 months (completion of the study, wave 2) to
give specific feedback on retention issues and treatment
conditions. Due to difficulties interviewing participants
at two time points, interviews were conducted at any
time between 6 and 9 months from recruitment into the
study. A selected sample of staff involved with the inter-
vention (both directly and in-directly) were also inter-
viewed on study completion.
Sample size
No formal calculation is required for a feasibility study
since measuring effectiveness was not a key objective.The sample size of 50 was considered appropriate for
assessing key objectives related to recruitment, retention,
randomisation, data capture, performance of outcome
measures and acceptability. In particular, this would
allow us to estimate the retention of the participants to
within ± 11% assuming an 80% retention rate and is in
line with current guidelines to estimate the parameters
required for a sample size calculation [ 36].
Randomisation and masking
Following written informed consent, participants were
randomised using a third-party web-based randomisation
system which ensured concealed allocation. Participants
were stratified according to number of previous detoxifi-
cations (> 2 vs. ≤2) and site. Randomisation had a random
block size (2 –4). Research Assistants were blind to the
randomisation occurring at the opposite study site. It was
planned for them therefore to conduct the follow-up in-
terviews for the opposite site. This initial plan for cross
site follow-up was abandoned during the 3 months
follow-up period as it proved to be too great a logistic and
administrative barrier for successful follow up efforts.
Progression criteria
Progression criteria to a full RCT were agreed in ad-
vance and included study retention, treatment compli-
ance and data completion.
Results
Demographics
We recruited alcohol-dependent individuals, aged 18
or over who had a desire to stop drinking. Table 1
shows the baseline data for all 48 randomised partici-
pants. Overall, whilst the two groups were reasonably
equivalent in terms of mean age, ethnicity, years of
education and key variables such as baseline SADQ,
there were also important differences in sex and liv-
ing arrangements with more males and single people
in the intervention group. However, this is not unex-
pected given the size of the groups. Overall, the par-
ticipants had an average age of 46.4 years (range, 31
to 63), 28 (58%) were male and had previously under-
taken a median of two previous detoxifications (range,
0 to 24). These demographics reflect the population
in treatment.
Feasibility outcomes
Recruitment
Forty-eight out of fifty eligible participants were re-
cruited over 9 months (September 2017 –May 2018).
Thirty-three participants were recruited from site 1 and
15 from site 2. The main reasons for not been eligible to
participate were not wishing to be abstinent and inability
to commit to group work (see Fig. 1). The rate ofKouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 7 of 14
recruitment was higher when the research assistants
were on site, which was supported by the qualitative in-
terviews of staff (see section below).
Retention
Retention in the trial for the whole duration of the 12
months was 75%, 80% ( n= 20) for the intervention
group and 69% ( n= 16) for usual care. The retention
rate indicates strong acceptability in the study popula-
tion (see Table 2).
Follow-up
The follow-up rate was 65% ( n= 31) at 3 months, 50%
(n= 24) at 6 months and 63% ( n= 30) at 12 months,
with more follow-ups taking place over the phone. The
follow-up rate at 3 months was 74% ( n= 17) for usual
care and 56% ( n= 14) for the intervention. At 6 months,
it was 52% ( n= 12) for usual care and 48% ( n= 12) for
the intervention. Finally, at 12 months, it was 61% ( n=14) for usual care and 64% ( n= 16) for the intervention
(Fig. 1).
Intervention sessions attended
Treatment compliance, defined as attending 6 ses-
sions over 12 weeks, was 44% with 47% (8/17) and
37.5% (3/8) for the first and second site respectively,
which is considered acceptable for a population at-
tending addiction services [ 13].
Progression criteria
Progression criteria to a full RCT were agreed in
advance and included study retention, treatment
compliance and data completion. As shown in
Table 3, retention was excellent, and no change is
required. Regarding treatment compliance, minor
changes are required to proceed to a full trial,
whereas regarding data completion for primary out-
come major changes are required before proceeding
to a full trial.
Data completeness
Completeness of data outcomes was varied (29% as low-
est for Alcohol Urge Questionnaire at 6 months to 74%
for days of abstinence at 3 months). Completeness of
primary outcome was 65%, 50% and 63% at 3-, 6- and
12-month follow-up respectively.
Completion of the Incentive Conflict Task (ICT) was
compromised with only 13 tests completed at three 3
months and even less at all three follow-up points. This
was direct result of the need for most participants to be
followed-up over telephone and not face to face as ini-
tially planned (see Table 2).
Primary outcomes
The intervention group had more days abstinent in the
previous 90 days at 12 months (54.5) versus usual care
(41.5). Seven intervention participants (28%) and five of
the usual care group (22%) restarted drinking at some
point during the follow up period.
Secondary outcomes
Severity of dependence (SADQ scores) were higher, time
to relapse shorter and urges (Alcohol Urge Question-
naire scores) higher for the intervention group at all fol-
low up points. The results from ICT will be reported
separately. A summary is presented in Table 2.
Equal percentages (52%) from each arm were detoxed
(including guided self-detox). This is lower than antici-
pated, possibly due to generic challenges that services
face.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of randomised participants

Health economics evaluation
Of the total of 48 participants, 39 were included in
the health economic analysis (19 intervention and 20
usual care). Of the nine excluded, one had moved
from intervention to usual care outside of study
protocol procedures and the clinic records for eight
i no n es i t ew e r em i s s i n gd u et oaf a c i l i t yr e l o c a t i o n .
Clinic data were not complete for many of the
remaining 39 participants with more items missing in
the usual care than intervent ion group. Approximately
50% of participants in both groups provided 12
months follow-up questionnaire data (service use and
EQ-5D). These levels of missing data were considered
too high to provide accurate estimates of costs or
changes in health-related quality of life. Two key
workers delivered each session of the intervention at
a cost (2018) of £102 per session (£17 per participant
per session), based on six per group, and NHS unit
costs [ 34].The mean time spent with participants by keyworkers
was 230.5 min in the usual care group and 340.84 min
for the intervention group. Converting service use into
costs, based on mean durations of contact, gives mean
total costs of £356.81 for the intervention group, com-
pared to £254.69 for usual care group. The intervention
group reported more community service use than the
usual care group. The overall costs are reflective of con-
tacts with healthcare professionals: £947.54 for the usual
care group compared to £1933.62 for the intervention
group, which includes costs for attendance at prepara-
tory sessions.
Process evaluation-treatment fidelity
At least one of each of six group sessions were observed
and scored independently for compliance with the man-
ual, by the Chief Investigator (CK) and an independent
rater (nurse Consultant in Addiction services), using
YACS II (2005). Group facilitators did not rate theirFig. 1 Trial consort diagram by treatment armKouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 9 of 14
own fidelity as per the original protocol. Instead, the
group facilitators were interviewed individually by CK
following the end of the intervention provision period
for the study. As far as usual care was concerned, tape
recording of key working sessions offered as part of
usual care was done in site 1 only. Nine of those sessions
were assessed in total, with at least one of each of the
three planned sessions and at least one session per key-
worker, using a specifically developed tool (see above).
In the second site, keyworkers refused to be taped. To
that effect, medical notes were reviewed by CK and the
content of session was scored using the same assessment
tool. Scores suggested no contamination of key working
session with content from the intervention in site 1. Insite 2, 3/7 participants allocated to usual care, received
additional sessions of psychological work beyond Motiv-
ational Interviewing, either by their keyworker or a
psychologist.
Qualitative interviews
Fourteen participants were interviewed from both sites.
Five of those were interviewed twice (between 3, 6 and
12 months) as per the original protocol, providing in
total 19 interviews. Interview guides were constructed
taking a narrative approach, asking participants to ‘tell
the story ’of their history of alcohol use, previous treat-
ment episodes, detoxification attempts, events that led
up to the current treatment episode, experiences of

taking part in the intervention/control preparation
groups, experiences of the actual detoxification, then
subsequent recovery, adaptation or relapse experiences.
Interviews were conducted by experienced researchers
trained in qualitative interviewing techniques (BH, CN).
Interviews lasted 60 –90 min. Audio files of interviews
were transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Data were
inductively thematically analysed case by case independ-
ently by both BH and CN using QSR NVIVo v12 soft-
ware. Descriptive thematic analysis was the most
appropriate analysis technique for answering feasibility
questions [ 37].
Overall, the qualitative data was generally positive and
supportive of the study. With a few exceptions, partici-
pants understood the purpose of the study and were
willing to be randomised. It was noteworthy that there
was some confusion regarding group allocation. This
suggests that simply ‘being in the study ’had a positive
benefit. Also, of note was the positive feedback for the
preparation groups (intervention). However, the inter-
views gleaned little detailed data on CBT-specific ele-
ments of the group intervention. Instead, participants
had generally positive feedback that seemed to be related
to a generalised group effect (being part of a group,
sharing experiences and learning from others). Most in-
dividuals found this beneficial, with only a few excep-
tions (notably those with diagnosed mental health
conditions who found group participation difficult).
Two staff members were interviewed (one from each
site) following the end of the study. Staff were generally
supportive of the intervention; however, staff acceptabil-
ity of both content and structure was key in consistent
facilitation of the intervention. Staff were initially hesi-
tant to use novel pre-habilitation strategies until they
had seen results for themselves and then understood
how it was useful to participants. There were some prac-
tical issues raised —availability of rooms and room set up
as being important to the running of the groups. There
was a lot of discussion about re-tendering of treatment
services and collection of outcome measures which may
conflict with ‘contract-led ’key performance indicators
for joint service providers. These discussions initially im-
peded smooth service running and group facilitation
until it was evident that the intervention facilitated
achievement of key performance indicators for the ser-
vice providers. This is an important context for under-
standing difficulties with implementing the group
intervention.
Discussion
This study reports the feasibility of conducting a trial to
further enhance the psychological work offered before
alcohol detoxification within the overall concept of pre-habilitation, to complement the existing rehabilitation
treatment approach.
We have recruited from two urban clinical addiction
sites, with easy access to public transport. Both sites
were covering a multicultural population, where lan-
guage could be a barrier for accessing treatment, even
more so when accessing a group intervention. In this
feasibility study, we did not need to offer the interven-
tion on an individual basis due to language barriers (as
per protocol); nevertheless, language remains a barrier
for a group intervention. Limited transport and longer
duration to and from the place that the group is offered
could be a barrier, as it could prolong the period of non-
drinking required and associated risk of withdrawal
symptoms. Another important factor related to the gen-
eralisability of the intervention concerns differences in
service models and commissioning arrangements be-
tween the recruitment sites. Such differences might be
challenging for the standardisation of the usual care arm
of the study; nevertheless, the challenges faced enhance
the wider generalisability of the results. In this feasibility
study, there was a major difference between the two sites
on the procedures for access to inpatient detoxification.
In site 1, the decision and the budget were controlled by
the local team, whereas in site 2 the decision and
budget allocated involved commissioners and specific
steps had to be followed (which did not allow random-
isation). This meant that only participants requesting
outpatient detoxification were entered into the study in
site 2. Remaining procedures across sites were
standardised.
We were able to recruit appropriate participants (mod-
erate to severe dependence on alcohol) with a rate of six
recruits per month. The recruitment rate has been com-
promised by the generic environment of the addiction
services in England such as limited investment, frequent
re-tendering of services and an overall climate of compe-
tition rather than collaboration [ 37]. Such factors could
become barriers for successful recruitment for a future
RCT trial. Nevertheless, the sample demographic charac-
teristics reflected those of the population in treatment
[13]. Randomisation was successful except for more
males and single people having been allocated to the
intervention arm; however, neither were considered to
be important confounders likely to affect the results.
The retention rate was particularly good for dependent
alcohol users. Similarly, follow-up rates at 12 months for
the primary outcome were also acceptable. Low follow-
up rates were observed at 6 months which coincided
with the immediate period prior and post re-tendering
in the highest recruiting site (site 1). Interview over tele-
phone was found to be the best follow up strategy but
compromised the ability to collect data for ICT, CSRI
and other questionnaires, indicating the importance ofKouimtsidis et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:148 Page 11 of 14
using brief tools rather than longer self-completion
questionnaires. A mixed method of CSRI and clinical
notes review should be used for health economic evalu-
ation. There were also technical difficulties with the op-
eration of ICT. Despite the above challenges, this has
been the first time that ICT is used with persons whilst
they are still drinking (23 participants at baseline), and
this study provides valuable data on the effect of alcohol
in decision making. These results will be reported separ-
ately. Data completion though for the primary outcome
was lower than expected suggesting major changes are
required. Equally, we consider a longer recruitment
period with full time research assistants positioned in
each recruiting site would be more effective than seeking
larger numbers of recruiting sites with either part time
or full-time research assistants recruiting for shorter re-
cruitment periods. Such a strategy might compromise
the generalisability of the results. This risk could be re-
duced with better triangulation of recruiting sites taking
into account two main factors (i) geography (urban/
rural), and (ii) commissioning arrangements.
To allow for better monitoring of study participants,
research assistants were blind to randomisation occur-
ring at the opposite site. The original plan was for re-
search assistants to complete follow-ups at the opposite
site and hence to be blind to allocation. However, blind-
ing for psychological interventions is difficult with this
population [ 2]. Blinding proved to be over ambitious for
a trial with this population where appointments were
missed and subsequent follow up was further compli-
cated by research assistant availability.
Compliance with the intervention although acceptable
has indicated that changes are required for a definitive
trial. We consider that recruitment and randomisation
at the first point of contact with the service increased
the risk of early drop out from treatment and the study,
compromising treatment compliance. Furthermore, in
the current study, two individuals with long histories of
poor treatment retention and early dropouts were allo-
cated to the intervention arm. In a future RCT, we
would randomise individuals at a later point once they
are retained in the service for a brief period (usual prac-
tice of 4 weeks), having received a small number of key
working sessions and so demonstrating some clear com-
mitment to treatment. Furthermore, the intervention
should be better standardised with the expectation that
participants attend consecutive weekly sessions, within a
maximum period of 12 weeks. Missed sessions would
be offered by one of the facilitators on an individual
basis. Most importantly there would be more en-
hanced communication and cooperation between key
workers and group facilitators for a pro-active and
more effective management of participants at risk of
dropping out.The strategy used to assess fidelity to the intervention
manual was adequate as was the training, supervision
and support provided to group facilitators for the study.
For a future trial, support of group facilitators should be
allocated to local supervisors per recruitment site to in-
crease hands-on support. This is considered critical to
reduce contamination between the intervention and
usual care.
The low rate of participants receiving detoxification
for both arms could be an indicator of limited progres-
sion of clients through treatment stages, highlighting the
major challenges that services face in their efforts to de-
liver treatment in a timely and structured way. Generic
factors in English addiction services such as tendering of
services, limited resources and high turnover of staff are
compromising the capacity of treatment services to host
clinical research and are also compromising the standar-
dised delivery of both intervention and usual care. These
factors have been discussed widely both in the past and
more recently in the UK [ 38]. In a future trial, the on-
going support to group facilitators and the monitoring
of usual care provision should be augmented, given the
challenging clinical reality.
Conclusions
Psychological interventions with individuals who are
dependent on alcohol and who are actively drinking at
the time of the intervention have been regarded as chal-
lenging. Furthermore, limited work has been done so far
on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The results
of this feasibility trial indicate that despite the challenges
described above, with appropriate modifications, a full
multicentre trial would be possible to test the effective-
ness and cost-effectiveness of a pre-habilitation-based
intervention such as SPADe group against usual care.
