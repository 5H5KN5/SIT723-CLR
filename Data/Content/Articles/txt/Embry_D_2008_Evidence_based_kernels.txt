Abstract This paper describes evidence-based kernels,
fundamental units of behavioral inﬂuence that appear to
underlie effective prevention and treatment for children,adults, and families. A kernel is a behavior–inﬂuence
procedure shown through experimental analysis to affect a
speciﬁc behavior and that is indivisible in the sense thatremoving any of its components would render it inert.
Existing evidence shows that a variety of kernels can
inﬂuence behavior in context, and some evidence suggeststhat frequent use or sufﬁcient use of some kernels may
produce longer lasting behavioral shifts. The analysis of
kernels could contribute to an empirically based theory ofbehavioral inﬂuence, augment existing prevention or
treatment efforts, facilitate the dissemination of effective
prevention and treatment practices, clarify the activeingredients in existing interventions, and contribute to
efﬁciently developing interventions that are more effective.
Kernels involve one or more of the following mechanismsof behavior inﬂuence: reinforcement, altering antecedents,
changing verbal relational responding, or changing physi-
ological states directly. The paper describes 52 of these
kernels, and details practical, theoretical, and research
implications, including calling for a national database ofkernels that inﬂuence human behavior.
Keywords Evidence-based kernels /C1
Public-health beneﬁts /C1Prevention /C1TreatmentThis paper presents an analysis of fundamental units of
behavioral inﬂuence that underlie effective prevention and
treatment. We call these units kernels . They have two
deﬁning features. First, in experimental analysis,
researchers have found them to have a reliable effect on
one or more speciﬁc behaviors. Second, they are funda-mental units of behavior inﬂuence in the sense that deleting
any component of a kernel would render it inert. Under-
standing kernels could contribute to an empirically basedtheory of behavioral inﬂuence, facilitate dissemination of
effective prevention and treatment practices, clarify the
active ingredients in existing interventions, and contributeto developing interventions that are more efﬁcient and
effective. Subsequent sections of this paper expand on the
two essential features of evidence-based kernels, as well asthe origins of the idea and terminology.
The ultimate goals of treatment and prevention research
are a reduction of the prevalence of the most common andcostly problems of behavior and an increase in the preva-
lence of wellbeing. Current thinking about how to
accomplish this assumes that we will identify empirically
supported programs and, to a lesser extent, policies, and
will disseminate them widely and effectively. Althoughsubstantial progress is occurring through this strategy, there
are at least four limitations to it that point to the value of
kernels as a complementary strategy.
First, it is difﬁcult to implement a program’s efﬁcacy
widely with ﬁdelity or effectiveness. Ringwalt et al. ( 2003 )
surveyed a sample of 1,795 school staff members who werein charge of teaching substance-use prevention programs.
Nearly two-thirds reported teaching content that meta-
analyses showed was effective. However, only 17% usedeffective delivery and only 14% used both effective
delivery and content. In a second study, Ringwalt et al.
(2003 ) found that about one-ﬁfth of teachers of substance-

use prevention curricula did not use a curriculum guide at
all and only 15% reported following one closely. Hallfors
and Godette ( 2002 ) studied 104 school districts in 12 states.
They found that many districts selected evidence-basedprograms, but only 19% of district coordinators indicated
their schools implemented those programs with ﬁdelity.
They concluded there was inadequate funding and infra-structural support for implementation. More recently,
prevention programs with long-standing efﬁcacy data from
more controlled conditions and settings, such as ProjectAlert or Reconnecting Youth (e.g., Bell et al. 1993 ;
Ellickson et al. 1993 ), were tested for effectiveness in real-
world contexts and conditions. Most often, the obtainedeffectiveness results do not replicate the efﬁcacy trials
(e.g., Hallfors et al. 2006 ; Sanchez et al. 2007 ; St. Pierre
et al. 2005 ). Research on how to get programs widely
adopted, effectively implemented, and appropriately
adapted to different conditions is still in its infancy.
However, initial evidence suggests that sole reliance onprogram dissemination to affect population outcomes will
have a limited impact, even with restrictive policies (e.g.,
Hallfors et al. 2007 ).
Second, many problems—or behaviors—that affect
wellbeing do not require lengthy or complex interventions
involving consultations, workshops, training, or support.Consider a few examples. A teacher might improve
classroom behavior just by using some non-verbal cues
during transitions (Abbott et al. 1998 ; Krantz and Risley
1977 ; Rosenkoetter and Fowler 1986 ) or reduce aggression
and bullying on the playground by cooperative games(Murphy et al. 1983 ). A parent might easily improve a
teenager’s cooperation with a mystery motivator (Madaus
et al. 2003 ). A principal might reduce disturbing or dis-
ruptive behaviors and increase engaged learning with the
principal’s lottery (Thorpe et al. 1978 ). A college professor
might increase participation of students with responsecards instead of the expensive clicker systems (Shabani and
Carr 2004 ). In other words, a simple method of behavior
inﬂuence might well solve a speciﬁc problem, and that wasall that was required. The simple solution might actually
avoid larger, more unpleasant difﬁculties or have greater
good over time. For example, the response cards used in aclassroom increase academic achievement (Gardner et al.
1994 ) or the use of organized recess might not only reduce
aggression on the playground, but also improve the aca-demic performance of children in the classroom with
ADHD (Jarrett et al. 1998 ). Thus, simple solutions might
just be sufﬁcient in many cases.
Third, program dissemination is unlikely to affect
practices or problems that fall outside the scope of a pro-
gram. Teachers, clinicians, parents, healthcare providers,coworkers, supervisors, and many others are constantly
trying to have a beneﬁcial inﬂuence on others’ behavior.Existing formal programs address only a small range of
situations and behaviors they seek to inﬂuence. For
example, parents may complain to a teacher, principal,
nurse, or doctor how hard it is to get their young childmoving in the morning. Alone, such a complaint does not
merit implementing parenting skills training. However, a
simple behavior change strategy, such as the Beat the
Timer game (Adams and Drabman 1995 ), in which the
child receives a reward for completing a behavior before
the timer goes off, could solve the problem, and preventparent–child conﬂict. Even in situations where an effective
program exists, the program dissemination strategy will fail
to affect anypractices of those who choose not to adopt the
program. A related issue is that that many problems have
no evidence-based programs on published approved lists.
For example, bipolar disorder is increasingly commonamong younger children, yet there are no listed programs
for teachers with such children. Thus, given current evi-
dence, it is likely that for now most daily practices thatinﬂuence human development will fall outside the scope of
existing programs. Failing to improve those practices is a
missed opportunity.
Cost is a fourth limitation of depending solely on pro-
gram dissemination to affect public health. The National
Registry of Effective Programs and Practices providescost information (see http://modelprograms.samhsa.gov/
template.cfm?page=nrepbutton ). Direct costs for program
developers include material production, training, licensing,
ongoing consultation of adopters, results monitoring, and
program improvement. There are also hidden costs, such asvenues, staff training, temporary staff replacement to cover
duties, and administrative costs. For example, a model
universal program that reduced observed aggression on theplayground by about 10% (Grossman et al. 1997 ) requires
17.5 h of direct instruction per pupil, plus indirect costs for
material and training of teachers. Thus, a school with 25teachers may spend $12,000–15,000 for materials, training,
staff timing, and (possibly) substitute teachers. A cost of
$500 per teacher per universal program is unexceptionalfor listed programs. Therapeutic model programs (e.g.,
Ogden and Halliday-Boykins 2004 ; Szapocznik and Wil-
liams 2000 ) can cost between $80,000 and 200,000
depending on the nature of licensing needs, training,
materials, supervision, monitoring, and stafﬁng. If multiple
evidence-based programs are required, costs per problem(e.g., tobacco, alcohol, violence, bullying, or mental ill-
ness) can bring the total to hundreds of thousands of dollars
in direct and indirect costs per setting. These funds are nottypically available to schools, human service agencies,
groups, and others charged with prevention and treatment.
There is no reason to expect a surge in such funds at alocal, state, or federal level anytime soon. Clearly, if pro-
gram adoption is the only avenue to large population76 Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113

effects, progress will be slow and costly. It would be very
useful from a public health and safety perspective if there
were low-cost prevention, intervention, and treatment
strategies to deploy easily—reducing the need for moreexpensive strategies that might not be possible to ﬁeld
where money and resources are scarce.
A ﬁfth concern is that existing programs have limited
effectiveness, modest effect sizes, scalability concerns,
weak generalization, difﬁculty with maintenance or sus-
tainability, and even iatrogenic effects (e.g., Hallfors et al.2006 ; St. Pierre et al. 2005 ; Sanchez et al. 2007 ). This is
not to diminish the enormous progress of prevention sci-
ence in the past 30 years (Biglan 2004 ). However,
inspection of recent meta-analyses of interventions (e.g.,
Bledsoe 2003 ; Derzon et al. 2005 ,2006 ; Ennett et al. 2003 ;
L}osel and Beelmann 2003 ; Lipsey et al. 2006 ; Scheckner
et al. 2004 ; Tobler et al. 2000 ) ﬁnds plenty of room for
improving the effectiveness of our programs.
A sixth concern is that current evidence-based programs
do not easily meet the diffusion criteria (Rogers 1995 ). For
instance, individuals who might be early adopters of pro-
ven and tested prevention strategies can often gain accessto these strategies only through institutions such as schools
or state agencies. If a school or agency lags, thousands of
individuals or families in geographic areas cannot availthemselves of strategies that might prevent school failure,
substance abuse, mental illness, delinquency, or other ills.
Individual teachers also cannot adopt science-based strat-
egies, as almost all evidence-based prevention programs
require school or district adoptions. For example, it iseasier for a parent or teacher to gain access to a prescrip-
tion drug to treat ADHD or depression than to obtain
evidence-based strategies that might similarly affectbehavior (e.g., Ridgway et al. 2003 ; Schilling et al. 2003 ;
Larun et al. 2006 ).
Each limitation points to the value of identifying and
making available kernels of behavior inﬂuence. We do not
suggest that kernels replace tested, proven programs; we
propose that kernels supplement or strengthen programs,help to create new programs more efﬁciently, or make
effective behavior–inﬂuence techniques available in situa-
tions where programs are unavailable, impractical, or justunnecessary based on the simplicity of the problem
addressed.
Kernel Deﬁnition, Derivation, and Examples
We designate as evidence-based kernels any indivisible
procedure shown through experimental evaluation to pro-
duce reliable effects on behavior (Embry 2004 ). The
derivation of the term ‘‘kernels’’ arose in Embry’s ( 2004 )
paper describing the active ingredients in evidenced-basedprevention or treatment behavior-change programs, distinct
from the earlier nebulous concepts of ‘‘principles of
effectiveness.’’ The perceived need for a taxonomy and
nomenclature for these active ingredients emerged from ayearlong series of meetings organized by the second
author, involving some 20 leading prevention, scientiﬁc,
and policy leaders. Some of the scientists at the meetingswere Richard Catalano, Harold Holder, Brian Flay, and the
authors of this paper. These scientists had created and
tested many prevention and treatment programs and had
used some common ingredients to make those programs
work. The scientists, however, had never denominatedthose ingredients or active components in ways that each
other understood or that others might easily perceive for
new invention or systematic replications.
Other disciplines do have such taxonomies and
nomenclature. For example, medications contain lists of
known ‘‘active ingredients,’’ which have proven effec-tiveness separate from effects of the compounded product.
For example, aspirin is clearly effective in its own right,
and so are enteric coatings. Joined, they result in a productsuch as ‘‘buffered aspirin,’’ composed of two separate
active ingredients. One can look up medications’ active
ingredients in publications like the Physician’s Desk Ref-
erence and look up how to use them in the Merck Manual .
Nothing similar exists in applied behavioral science.
We chose the term ‘‘evidence-based kernel’’ for several
reasons. First, it had the metaphorical resonance of some-
thing organic that inﬂuenced life or behavior. Second, the
metaphor was about something very compact, althoughobviously in quantity or through blending, it could become
something bigger or more productive. Third, the term was
novel, which would confer the ability to track its use andmake its meaning clear and crisp compared to words or
phrases in past use such as ‘‘principles of effectiveness.’’
The unit of a kernel is indivisible in the sense that it
would be ineffective if one eliminated any of its compo-
nents. Experimental evaluations of kernels may involve
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or interrupted time-series experiments (Flay et al. 2004 ). Examples of kernels
include timeout, written praise notes, self-monitoring,
framing relations among stimuli to affect the value of agiven stimulus, and physiological strategies such as nasal
breathing when upset or increasing omega-3 fatty acids in
the diet in order to inﬂuence behavior. The description of akernel as an indivisible procedure merits discussion by
metaphor and example.
First, a kernel is like a seed that contains central infor-
mation for growth or change. Second, a kernel also evokes
the idea of an implicit human technology to effect change
from the earliest use of agriculture to the use of core rou-tines in modern computers. A broken seed will not grow,
and a broken core computer routine (‘‘kernel panic’’) willClin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113 77
123
cause the machine to be inoperative. One of the oldest
prepared foods by humans, dating to the Neolithic era—
bread, further illustrates the point of indivisibility. Bread
consists of ﬂour and water. Bread may be leavened orunleavened. Even unleavened, bread can be quite varied:
lavashes, tortilla, chapatis, rotis, naans, etc. Bread is simple
and irreductable: remove the ﬂour or liquid, there is nobread. The example of bread also illustrates the nearly
inﬁnite ways additions to it can make it sweet, spicy, bitter,
fattening, medicinal, or celebratory. Of course other prep-
arations of meat, legumes, fruits, or vegetables can be
served with bread to form daily meals or diet—a culinaryequivalent of a program.
Second, an evidence-based kernel has core components
that cannot be removed and be effective. Consider someexamples: (1) Timeout must be a brief removal from
whatever is reinforcing the undesirable behavior, followed
by intensive reinforcement for engaging in the desiredbehavior upon return; (2) a Home-Note from school must
cue high rates of positive reinforcement from home adults,
not emphasize the bad behavior at school; (3) beat thetimer requires some kind of mechanical device to keep
track of time, set for a brief time, and with a signal that
cues reinforcement for the target behavior when the timeelapses; and (4) nasal breathing must involve breathing
through the nose and not the through the mouth, when
upset, for the physiological and behavior beneﬁts tohappen.
Programs, however, are rarely irreductable. Programs
contain many components or kernels, and the loss of asingle one enables the program still to have some effect in
most cases. For example, evidence-based reading programs
like Direct Instruction or Success for All have kernels suchas choral responding or peer-assisted learning among many
other active ingredients. The loss or omission of a single
program component may reduce results but will not oblit-erate results typically.
Naturally, some may ask about the cultural competence
of evidence-based kernels. Anthropologists or evolutionarytheorists (e.g., Wilson and Wilson 2007 ) posit human
evolution and advancement are signiﬁcantly based on our
ability to inﬂuence each other for group beneﬁt. We sug-gest that the idea of evidence-based kernels has deep roots
in anthropology. Humans have a long history of creating
ways to inﬂuence each other, and noticing the effects oftheir inventions to do so. While we hold fast to the notion
that an evidence-based kernel must have peer-reviewed
publication showing experimentally proven results, we arenot blind to the fact that many kernels listed in this pub-
lication have more than chance analogue in the wisdom
traditions of cultures to inﬂuence the behavior of relatives,mates, and neighbors. Many of the kernels herein are not
just found in evidence-based programs or scientiﬁcjournals; they can be found, too, in old culturally selected
practices. For example, choral responding is a scienti-
ﬁcally proven practice described herein (e.g., Godfrey
et al. 2003 ), yet it can be found as a cultural practice from
cultures as environmentally diverse as Polynesians to
Arctic peoples; scientists funded by the National
Institute of Health have recently experimentally demon-strated the efﬁcacy of the omega-3 fatty acid on
inﬂuencing many types of human behavior (e.g., Freeman
et al. 2006a ,b), while grandmothers several hundred years
ago made sure that everybody had their daily dose of cod
liver oil; and while legions of behavioral scientists sincethe 1960s may have demonstrated the effects of praise
(e.g., Leblanc et al. 2005 ), the Yup’ik peoples of Alaska
apparently applied the principle a long time before Euro-pean contact.
Humans—be they parents, teachers, leaders, business
people, or even scientists—attempt to inﬂuence behavior,which begs the question of what inﬂuence might mean.
Thus, a kernel may increase the frequency or duration of a
behavior or may make a behavior less likely. The change infrequency or duration of behavior is observable in real
time. The mechanism of inﬂuence might be a function of
an antecedent to channel behavior, a consequence follow-ing the behavior, a set of words about the behavior, or
direct manipulation of physiology. These possible mecha-
nisms or pathways of how kernels can inﬂuence theacquisition, rate, or duration of behavior will be discussed
subsequently. Some examples of kernels now merit
attention.
The Example of Timeout
Timeout was one of the ﬁrst kernels of behavior–inﬂuence
technology (Wolf et al. 1964 ). Dicky was a 3-year-old boy
with autism who had undergone surgery for cataracts. He
lived in a psychiatric hospital and had frequent tantrumsresulting in self-injury. In tribute to the late Montrose
Wolf, Risley described this landmark study (Risley 2005 ):
After having just discovered the power of adult
attention for young children, and realizing that the
staff could not simply ignore temper tantrums, espe-cially violent ones with mild self-abuse, Wolf
decided to prescribe a response to tantrums that
would minimize any social reinforcing effect of thenecessary attention and counterbalance that rein-
forcement with a period of social isolation. The
prescription for tantrums was to place Dicky, calmlyand without comment, in his room until the tantrum
ceased and at least 10 minutes had passed. When
tantrums were under control and after wearing glasseshad been hand shaped, Dicky began to throw his78 Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113
123
glasses occasionally. When the social isolation pre-
scription was applied, glasses throwing decreasedfrom about twice per day to zero. But the hospital
staff doubted that it was due to the procedure,
because Dicky didn’t seem to mind being taken to hisroom; he just rocked in his rocking chair and hum-
med to himself. Because throwing glasses was both
less serious and more reliably measured than tan-trums, Wolf agreed to discontinue the procedure—
and glasses throwing soon increased to the previous
level. The social isolation procedure was reinstated,and glasses throwing decreased again to zero.
(pp. 281–282)
Thus was born timeout , shown since in hundreds of
studies to reduce the frequency of a vast range of behav-
iors. It is a staple of nearly every evidence-based
prevention program for parenting (e.g., Incredible Years[Webster-Stratton and Reid 2007 ]; Triple P [Sanders and
Markie-Dadds 1996 ]; Parent Management Training
[Forgatch et al. 2005a ,b]). It is also part of popular culture.
Shows like Nanny 911 display its use; websites with advice
to parents describe it (e.g., http://www.thelaboroﬂove.com/
forum/quality/timeout.html ). Although there is no popula-
tion-based data on the prevalence of families and schools
using timeout, it seems that in many areas, timeout is the
normative replacement for harsh methods of discipline.
The Example of Nasal Breathing or ‘‘Doing Turtle’’
Humans are amazing at noticing the effects of small
physiological interventions that inﬂuence human behavior.
Grandmothers and experienced teachers, for example,often tell children who are emotionally overwrought and
hyperventilating to close their mouths and breathe through
the nose while exhaling through the mouth. This strategyis taught formally in such evidence-based prevention
programs as the Incredible Years and PATHS (Positive
Alternative Thinking Skills), and even has a child-friendlyname and story of ‘‘doing turtle’’ (Robin et al. 1976 ). The
strategy is based in empirical observations of the rela-
tionship among breathing patterns, physiologicalmeasures, behavior, and children’s emotional states
(McDonnell and Bowden 1989 ; Naveen et al. 1997 ; Perna
et al. 2002 ; Pine et al. 1998 ; Telles et al. 1997 ; Zaich-
kowsky et al. 1986 ). This kernel also illustrates how a
simple strategy might be independently discovered and
tested from very different theoretical perspectives (e.g.,pediatric medical practice, basic research, child psychol-
ogy, prevention, parenting, and even alternative bodywork
such as yoga). Like most kernels, it can be used andproven on its own, or incorporated in programmatic
efforts.Theoretical Taxonomy of Kernels
Although simple enumeration of kernels may support
effective practice, their contribution may be more sub-
stantial if we organize them within a theoretical frameworkto delineate the key inﬂuences on behavior. Such a frame-
work would facilitate generating new kernels and could
point to overlooked procedures for inﬂuencing behavior.
Kernels are understandable in terms of the operant
behavior of biological organisms, viewed within a
developmental and evolutionary perspective. Humanbehavior—including verbal, cognitive, and emotional
functioning—has developed over time as a function of the
biological capacities of the organism and the consequencesto behavior. Human behavioral tendencies are adaptive
functions of current situations and a history of consequences
for behaving in similar situations (e.g., Biglan 1995 ).
Kernels involve one of four primary processes. Many
involve consequation of behavior—the presentation or
removal of reinforcing or aversive consequences (Biglan1995 , Chap. 3). Others involve an antecedent stimulus
affecting motivation to behave due to a history of conse-
quences for responding to that stimulus (e.g., teachers’ use ofstandard signals to prompt students to sit down; Jason, Neal,
and Marinakis 1985 ; Wasserman 1977 ). A third type pri-
marily involves altering the relations that people deriveamong verbal stimuli in ways that affect motivation. For
example, to elicit a public commitment to engage in a
behavior (Chassin et al. 1990 ), a person feels prompted to
associate a network of consequences (such as others’
approval) with engaging in the behavior and other conse-
quences with not engaging in the behavior (e.g.,
disapproval). Each of these three types of kernels involves
ways in which a person’s social environment affects his or
her behavior. In a sense, kernels provide prescriptions forhow the social environment can show more support of human
development.
A fourth type of kernel alters a biological function of the
organisms in ways that affect behavior. An example is sup-
plementation of diets with omega-3 fatty acid (Haag 2003 ).
Indeed, any pharmacological agent that affects behaviorwould fall into this category, although we stress the impor-
tance of distinguishing prescription medications from non-
prescription, scientiﬁcally proven kernels that individuals ororganizations might choose to use without a prescription.
Table 1presents a list of kernels organized according to
this theoretical framework. We categorize each kernel interms of the primary mechanism by which it affects
behavior, although clearly many kernels involve more than
one process. Space precludes a complete review of the
empirical evidence for each kernel, but we cite all exper-
imental evaluations done for each kernel along with thetypes of experimental evaluations that have occurred. InClin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113 79

each of the following, we describe the empirical evidence
in detail for one kernel.
Designating Example Kernels for This Paper
The 52 kernels presented in Table 1are not exhaustive; they
are simply examples that meet the deﬁnition of a kernel
from the four types. That is, the kernel has one or more peer-reviewed experimental studies showing behavior change.
We are aware of many more kernels; the more kernels we
identiﬁed, the more we found others. Because of the year-
long process that gave rise to the need for and idea
denominating the active ingredients of evidence-basedprevention and a book about the science of preventing
problems of adolescence (Biglan et al. 2004 ), many of the
52 kernels were evident to us at ﬁrst blush because of ourown published studies and that of our colleagues on par-
enting, violence prevention, substance abuse prevention,
etc.; others we chose deliberately to illustrate the potentialtheoretical diversity of kernels—an interesting point in
itself, exempliﬁed by reactions to early drafts of the paper.
Some early readers were delighted to see the inclusion ofexamples from behavior analysis, yet chaffed at the physi-
ological kernels such as omega-3 and massage—despite the
scientiﬁc evidence available for each. Others objected tobehavioral procedures, arguing that behavioral procedures
were proven to be ineffective—despite studies showing
otherwise. We are aware that any given professional com-munity might disagree with the theoretical approach of
another professional group, yet a taxonomy of kernels
begins to elucidate how, where, when, for whom, and forwhat scientiﬁcally proven strategies might be more or less
beneﬁcial in inﬂuencing human behavior. We imagine that
a database of kernels will emerge, much like the humangenome project (i.e., http://genomics.energy.gov/ ) wherein
the breadth, depth, magnitude, and replications of the
effects of any given kernel might be reported by the inter-national research community in order to build an open-
source molecular technology of behavioral inﬂuence. The
arbitrary selection of the 52 kernels in this paper illustratesthe possibility of a rich ‘‘behaviornome’’ type project for
fundamental units of behavioral inﬂuence. Subsequent
paragraphs detail examples of four types of kernels forinﬂuencing behavior from Table 1, as a proof of concept
from 52 experimentally demonstrated kernels.
Kernels Altering Consequences for Behavior
Increasing Rate or Probability of Behavior
Many kernels increase behavior by mobilizing reinforce-
ment for the targeted behavior. These include vocal praise,
written praise notes, prize bowls, and public posting offeedback about the rate of a targeted behavior. Each delivers
positive consequences contingent on a behavior. In the case
of public posting of feedback, it is necessary that the recip-
ients of the post in some sense want to increase the behaviorrecorded in the postings. An example of a powerful yet
simple reinforcement kernel involves writing positive notes
to increase behavior. Written praise notes from a supervisorincrease work performance (Nordstrom et al. 1988 ), notes
written by a teacher to students increase academic success
(Hickey et al. 1979 ), and notes from students to each other
increase social competence (Skinner et al. 2000 ).
We also put special play with parents in this category. It
involves adults letting the child lead in free play activities
(Webster-Stratton and Reid 2007 ). Its purpose is to facili-
tate interactions in which parents do not command,criticize, or unduly restrict activities of the child and allow
the child to engage in fantasy play with the parent. Such
interactions presumably are reinforcing for parent andchild; the child receives the undivided attention of the
parent contingent on cooperative play, and the parent
experiences cooperative and pleasant interactions with thechild contingent on listening to the child and following the
child’s lead.
Decrease Behavior by Altering Consequences
Other procedures alter consequences in order to decrease
the frequency or probability of a behavior. Some involveensuring an undesirable behavior does not elicit rein-
forcement. Timeout is one such procedure. Rewarding
behavior incompatible with the undesirable behavior isanother.
A third set (ostensibly designed to decelerate behavior
rates) involves delivering aversive consequences for acertain behavior—traditionally termed punishment . How-
ever, many so-called punishments (e.g., lengthy grounding,
mandatory minimum sentences) have no beneﬁcial effectand, in fact, cause harm (Sampson and Laub 1994 ). Indeed,
a major challenge for many parenting programs is getting
parents to be less punitive. Thus, in developing proceduresto make aversive consequences contingent upon behavior,
we must evaluate them carefully to ensure they are effec-
tive and have few side effects.
Fining is an example of a negative consequence
affecting behavior. Agras et al. ( 1980 ) found that receiving
a ﬁne reduced individual, but not business, water wastage.Fletcher ( 1995 ) found that ﬁnes for parking in disabled-
reserved spaces notably decreased the behavior.
Kernels Altering Behavior Through Antecedents
Many kernels work by establishing the functions of ante-
cedents to behavior. A common example in schools is86 Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113
123
teachers establishing signals to guide transitions (Marion
and Muza 1998 ; Rosenkoetter and Fowler 1986 ; West et al.
1995 ). For example, many teachers turn lights off and on to
signal students to return to their seats and become quiet andattentive. Of course, positive consequences (e.g., praise)
are involved in establishing effectiveness of the stimulus,
but once established, the salient feature is the inﬂuence ofthe light on the behavior.
Assigning students meaningful roles (Rutter 1981 ),
such as setting up equipment for an assembly, taking roll,
or taking photographs for communicating desirable school
functions, are activities that organize useful behavior.Antecedents may also include organized playground
activities to reduce aggressive behavior and occasion
various social competencies (Murphy et al. 1983 ). Rein-
forcement follows naturally from the enactment of the
role.
It would be arbitrary to classify antecedent interventions
based upon whether they increase or decrease behavior.
This is because antecedents that prompt a desired behavior
simultaneously make troublesome behavior less likely.
Kernels Altering Behavior by Inﬂuencing Relational
Responding
Tradition within psychology suggests it is unfeasible to
deal with cognitive and emotional inﬂuences on behavior
within a basic behavioral framework of antecedents andconsequences. However, recent work on relational frame
theory (Hayes et al. 2001 ) has shown that human cognitive
and verbal behavior can be understood in terms of basicoperant processes, while honoring that humans do appear
to have unique evolutionarily selected brain structures
supporting language. To the extent this is true, it provides aparsimonious account of complex human functioning
within a contextualist framework focusing on manipulable
inﬂuences on behavior (Biglan and Hayes 1996 ).
Research on Relational Responding
There is growing evidence that a fundamental feature of
human cognitive or verbal processes is the relating of
stimuli (Barnes et al. 2000 ). Because this analysis is a
recent development and likely to be unfamiliar to mostreaders, we will elaborate on it here. Barnes et al. ( 2000 )
present a theoretical analysis of relational responding.
According to them, relating stimuli is the core feature ofverbal behavior. Perhaps the most rudimentary relational
responding involves naming. At the beginning of learning
language, young children learn to say names for objectsand separately learn to orient to objects when they hear
their names. Each response is operant behavior reinforced
by consequences such as attention, praise, and gaining ofan object. After multiple experiences of this sort, however,
a child also learns that if an object has a name, the name
also goes with the object. In other words, they become able
to derive the mutual entailment of name to object and
object to name. Further experiences like this enable chil-
dren to derive relations that are more complex. For
example, learning that a puppy is a kind of dog and thatBuddy is a puppy, a child is able to derive that Buddy is a
dog. We call this ability to derive relations between two
stimuli based on their relations with a third stimulus
combinatorial entailment.
The third deﬁning feature of relational responding is the
transformation of function . Humans’ derivation of relations
among stimuli can transform the functions of stimuli that
participate in the relation. For example, discovering thatone coin is worth more than another makes the coin more
reinforcing. Learning that water has bacilli in it may have
no impact on a child, but upon learning that bacilli aregerms, and that germs can you make you sick, a child’s
reaction to the water changes.
A fourth deﬁning feature of relational responding is
arbitrary applicability . Many of the relations we learn arise
from physical relations among stimuli. For example,
smaller than andlarger than are terms based on the relative
size of objects. However, humans become able to relate
stimuli in these terms even though the stimuli do not have
physical features involving relative size. If you hear thatone person has a bigger heart than another person does, you
may expect that person to be kinder, even though you
understand that his heart is not literally larger.
For theorists accustomed to the panoply of existing
cognitive constructs, which admittedly do a good job of
predicting much human behavior, the value of this analysismay be obscure. Its value lies in providing a direct analysis
of the speciﬁc procedures that inﬂuence relational
responding and thereby transform the functions of stimuli.
Increasing Behavior by Altering Relational Responding
Perhaps the simplest and most important procedures of this
type are those that augment the value of stimuli by inﬂu-
encing people to relate them to stimuli they already value.
If we tell children they can stay up a half hour more if theyget ﬁve stickers, we change their valuing of the stickers. In
essence, any procedures inﬂuencing people to relate a
stimulus with stimuli they already value make that stimulus
more reinforcing. Prevention and treatment scientists,
unlike marketing professionals, are often unfamiliar with
relational responding.
One example of relational responding involves branding
to inﬂuence behavior (Fischer et al. 1991 ). A recent study
shows that children preferred foods ‘‘branded’’ asMcDonald’s (logos, wrapping papers, etc.), even forClin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113 87
123
carrots, which McDonald’s does not sell (Robinson et al.
2007 ). Another example of branding is the introduction to
the PeaceBuilders program (Embry et al. 1996 ). It used
kernels like peer-to-peer praise/tootle notes and positivenotes home to establish the word PeaceBuilder as a valued
concept and to make being a PeaceBuilder—and all
behaviors later related to this concept—more reinforcing.The program improved social competence and reduced
aggression and injuries due to violence (Flannery et al.
2003 ; Krug et al. 1997 ). Biglan and colleagues recently
completed a study showing that pairing fun social activities
for middle-schoolers with a non-smoking brand (f2b—forFreedom to Breathe) reduced smoking among students
even when the program had little overt antitobacco content
(Gordon et al. 2008 ).
Another example of a kernel using relational responding
involves public commitment. When people publicly com-
mit to engage in a behavior, they are more likely to followthrough on the behavior (e.g., Burn and Oskamp 1986 ).
The public oath makes behavior inconsistent with that
pledge aversive due to expected disapproval for failing tofollow through with the promise.
In self-modeling, the professional helps to create a story
about a person’s behavior (Hosford 1980 ); the person typi-
cally participates in the process. The story embeds a person’s
self in a set of relations with desired behaviors and attributes
(e.g., depicting a child as a hero at school or home for helpingbring about peaceful behaviors; Embry et al. 1996 ). A child
might learn a series of self-help skills through photographs or
video (Hartley et al. 1998 ), making the child more apt to
relate engaging in the behavior with valued ideas, such as
being a ‘‘PeaceBuilder’’ (Embry et al. 1996 ).
Motivational interviewing (MI) is a powerful example of
relational responding. MI may seem complex, yet we believe
that subdividing it would destroy its effects. In MI, the
interviewer prompts a person to discuss a topic he or shegenerally avoids (e.g., one’s drinking patterns and difﬁcul-
ties associated with them; Bernstein et al. 2005 ;
McCambridge and Strang 2004 ; Miller et al. 1988 ). The
interviewer is warm and accepting as the person talks but
asks questions designed to put the person in psychological
contact with negative consequences of his/her behavior andthe possible beneﬁts of changing the behavior. It is clear this
process has reinforcing and antecedent features, but the most
salient aspect of the process seems to be that it alters the waypeople relate their problematic behavior to negative conse-
quences and the possible alternatives to more reinforcing
consequences. In other words, MI changes people’s net-works of relations in ways that make some behaviors more,
and others less, desirable. Although most treatment profes-
sionals are familiar with complex forms of MI, very brief,scientiﬁcally validated forms do exist (McCambridge and
Strang 2004 )—including just 15 min (Cohen et al. 2006 ).Decreasing Behavior by Altering Relational Responding
Some behavior–inﬂuence procedures discourage behavior
by prompting a person to relate the behavior to aversive
stimuli. In general, any procedure that prompts a person torelate undesirable behavior to negatively valenced stimuli
would qualify as such a procedure— provided there was
experimental evidence of its effect . For example, media
associating drug use with negative outcomes have some-
times been shown to reduce drug use (Palmgreen et al.
1995 ). Messages suggesting that youth’s peers will reject
them for smoking affects their motivation to use tobacco
(Pechmann and Knight 2002 ; Pechmann et al. 2003 ).
Kernels Altering Behavior Through Physiological
Interventions
Finally, some procedures primarily affect physiological
behavior. For centuries, humans have altered their health
and mood by manipulating physiological states. Anthro-
pological and archeological literatures are replete withexamples (Lalramnghinglova 1999 ; Rajan et al. 2002 ;
Rodrigues 2006 ; Spindler
1995 ). Hunters and gatherers
often consume plants with stimulant properties, apparentlysince they confer an advantage during tasks such as hunt-
ing, which requires sustained effort and attention. Modern
humans have similar reasons for using caffeine.
The impact of omega-3 fatty acid is a particularly
important example of a physiological kernel (Olafsdottir
et al. 2005 ). We use this example because of its exemplary
laboratory, epidemiological, and randomized control stud-
ies across many domains of prevention, intervention, and
treatment. Aside from epidemiological research on therelationships of omega-3 fatty acid (n-3) to a wide variety
of causes of morbidity and mortality (Hibbeln 2001 ),
experimental and quasi-experimental studies ﬁnd supple-mentation of omega-3 reduces violent aggression among
men (Gesch et al. 2002 ). Its use also reduces depression or
bipolar disorder (Mischoulon and Fava 2000 ; Stoll et al.
1999 ; Sund et al. 2003 ) and other health or public health
concerns, such as low birth weight and offspring IQ
(Helland et al. 2003 ). Although not yet proven, omega-3
may even alleviate some of the problems associated with
poverty, since poorer people have diets lower in omega-3
(Egeland et al. 2001 ; Liu et al. 2004 ).
Another intervention affecting behavior through direct
impact on physiology is deep breathing, shown to reduce
anxiety, arousal, and aggression among all ages (Appelset al. 1997 ; DiFilippo and Overholser 1999 ; Peck et al.
2005 ; Sharma et al. 2005 ; Suzuki et al. 2000 ). Zinc sup-
plementation may reduce or moderate ADHD symptoms
(Arnold et al. 2005 ; Bilici et al. 2004 ). We include a
variety of strategies that enhance self-regulation in aroused88 Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113
123
states such as ‘‘rough and tumble’’ play and related martial
arts training for children, as studies have shown it to reduce
children’s aggressive behavior (Bjorklund and Brown
1998 ; Paquette 2004 ; Pellegrini 1992 ; Shannon et al. 2002 )
and the mechanism appears to involve alteration of brain
chemistry (Panksepp et al. 2003 ; Siviy et al. 1996 ; Taylor
et al. 1986 ). The martial arts studies with children show
improved self-regulation, less aggression, and positive
mood along with decreased impulsiveness (Lakes and Hoyt
2004 ; Palermo et al. 2006 ; Twemlow and Sacco 1998 ;
Zivin et al. 2001 ), though student self-report may show less
change than classroom teacher reports (McDiarmid 2008 ).
The distinction between biological and environmental
interventions is not certain. Of course, any environmental
manipulation may inﬂuence biological functioning. Belowwe discuss interventions that directly manipulate biological
processes instead of changing psychological or behavioral
functioning.
Although many pharmacological agents alter behavior
and meet our deﬁnition of a kernel, the substantial litera-
ture on these inﬂuences is beyond the scope of this paper.Moreover, unlike nutritional supplements and nasal
breathing, FDA-approved pharmacological agents require
prescriptions; thus, they would not be available to mostprevention practitioners or consumers directly.
Prevention scientists, oriented toward the implementa-
tion of programs, may overlook physiological interventions.Publications about these kernels are not in journals devoted
to behavioral science but more likely to appear in medical,
public health, or specialty journals. However, the evidencefor them suggests that treatment and prevention scientists
should pay greater attention to the reciprocal relationships
between physiology and behaviors.
Types of Experimental Evidence Supporting Kernels
We deﬁne kernels as procedures shown empirically to
affect a behavior. In keeping with the Society for Preven-
tion Research Standards of Evidence (Flay et al. 2004 ), our
criteria for empirical support include RCTs and interruptedtime-series designs in which a procedure’s impact is
evaluated on a repeated measure of target behavior. Most
evaluations of kernels have been via interrupted time-seriesdesigns, while some, such as omega-3 impact, have been in
randomized trials. Some have undergone evaluation both
ways. Some studies measured generalizability of resultsacross time, behaviors, people, or places; others measured
only proximal or immediate effects.
Many kernels result from interplay between basic and
applied research. Variable interval or ratio contingency
management kernels (e.g., Mystery Motivator, Prize Bowl)
have roots in animal (Ferster and Skinner 1957 ) then human
(Majovski and Clement 1977 ) research. Researchers nextconducted clinical studies using interrupted time series
(Henderson et al. 1986 ; Leibowitz 1975 ; Libb et al. 1973 ;
Madaus et al. 2003 ; Moore et al. 1994 ; Robinson and
Sheridan 2000 ; Snell and Cole 1976 ) and formal RCTs
(Petry et al. 2004 ,2005 ).
Physiological kernels have a similar scientiﬁc trajectory.
For example, the understanding of omega-3 (n-3) has rootsin early epidemiological or forensic inquiries showing
differences among individuals with diseases or disorders
(Anderson and Connor 1989 ; Gudbjarnason et al. 1991
;
Lieber et al. 1969 ; Rudin 1981 ). Initial epidemiological
ﬁndings (Hibbeln 1998 ,2001 ,2002 ) prompted precision-
oriented laboratory studies (Hibbeln et al. 1998 ; Hibbeln
and Salem 1995 ) and larger epidemiological inquiries. All
this work led to clinical trials evaluating omega-3 supple-mentation (Nemets et al. 2002 ; Sund et al. 2003 ; Zanarini
and Frankenburg 2003 ).
The frequent use of interrupted time-series designs in
developing kernels deserves further comment. It reﬂects not
simply an arbitrary methodological preference but an
incremental, inductive, bottom-up strategy to build effectivebehavior–inﬂuence practices. Kernels are of necessity sim-
ple steps targeting a behavior one can easily measure
repeatedly; it is thus easy to implement interrupted time-series designs. Single-subject studies are quite robust in
terms of reducing threats to validity (Sidman 1960 ) and in
answering questions of whether a particular medication,procedure, or process is efﬁcacious in changing the behavior
of a person or small group of persons (e.g., families, class-
rooms, and organizations; Dadds et al. 1984 ; Greenwood
and Matyas 1990 ; Mayer et al. 1983 ; McGrath et al. 1987 ;
Reagles and O’Neill 1977 ). Such interrupted time-series
designs are not limited to evaluating individuals but are oftenthe choice for evaluating policy impact on large, important
social issues (Briscoe et al. 1975 ; Hayes and Cone 1977 ;
Wagenaar et al. 1988 ). One may summarize interrupted
time-series designs effectively via effect sizes and meta-
analyses (Campbell 2004 ; Stage and Quiroz 1997 ).
An important limitation on current understanding of
kernels is that we have relatively little information about
situations in which they will be effective and those in
which they will not be effective. Further research shouldexplore the range of situations in which given kernels work
and seek to develop a theory of the relationship between
situations and the efﬁcacy of kernels.
The Utility of Kernels
Disseminating Effective Behavior–inﬂuence Practices
If our ultimate public health goal is to minimize the
prevalence of behavioral and psychological problems andClin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113 89
123
improve wellbeing, then increasing the prevalence of
effective behavior–inﬂuence practices is essential. Dis-
seminating kernels could be an important supplement to
current reliance on program dissemination for achievingthis outcome. Kernels have most features that Rogers
(1995 ) identiﬁed as important in fostering dissemination.
He observed that people are more likely to adopt andimplement a practice if it is simple and easily tested, its
effects are readily observable, it appears to offer an
advantage over existing practices, it addresses an important
problem, and it is compatible with existing practices.
Most kernels are quite simple and consist of an easily
tested, low-cost activity. Moreover, it is usually possible to
observe their immediate impact on a person’s behavior; it
does not require statistical analysis of groups of individu-als. As a result, the person who tries a kernel is likely to
observe immediate beneﬁt, which will likely reinforce its
use. Finally, as the list of kernels in Table 1shows, most
kernels affect behaviors important to change agents.
As noted above, even if empirically supported programs
were widely disseminated, numerous behavior–inﬂuenceinteractions in society would fall outside the scope of
existing programs. For example, programs may teach social
competencies to avoid aggressive behavior (Taylor et al.1999 ) but teachers and youth leaders need ways to structure
interactions among youth so that prompts for aggressive
behavior decrease. Cooperative games (Murphy et al.1983 ); peer-to-peer tootle/praise notes (Embry et al. 1996 ;
Mayer et al. 1983 ,1993 ; Skinner et al. 2000 ); the princi-
pal’s lottery or preferrals (Thorpe et al. 1978 ,1979 ); and
non-verbal transition cues (Abbott et al. 1998 ; Embry et al.
1996 ; Krantz and Risley 1977 ; Rosenkoetter and Fowler
1986 ) are easy to build into daily school or afterschool
routines. They can also structure student interactions to
minimize prompts to engage in aggression. If we widely
disseminated kernels to behavior–inﬂuence agents (e.g.,teachers, therapists, youth leaders, human service workers,
and parents), it could result in effective behavior support
practices being more widely used than if we waited for theseagents to generalize good practices from programs that they
were trained to use in speciﬁc situations.
Glasgow et al. ( 1999 ) proposed the RE-AIM framework
for thinking about the long-term public health effects of
interventions. They argue that the beneﬁt of a practice is a
function of its Reach times its Efﬁcacy . However, even an
efﬁcacious intervention that reaches many people will have
limited impact over time, unless it is Adopted, Imple-
mented , and Maintained . From this standpoint, kernels
supplement program dissemination strategies because their
readily observed beneﬁts (efﬁcacy) make them prone for
adoption and maintenance and because they will increasethe reach of beneﬁcial behavior–inﬂuence practices since
there are kernels relevant to so many situations.A recent RCT of a media version of Triple P (Positive
Parenting Program(s); Sanders et al. 2000 ) illustrates this
point. Behavioral parenting skills programs consist largely
of kernels (e.g., timeout, praise, and special play). Parentswho go through such programs learn several important
behavior–inﬂuence strategies. However, the reach of these
programs is limited, due to administration costs and costsin time and money to participants. Triple P’s media version
reﬂects the recognition that a population-based impact may
be greater if speciﬁc kernels of effective parenting practice
can reach large numbers of parents. Preliminary data from
this 18-county RCT showed that the promotion of ‘‘kernel-like’’ parenting practices through media, tip sheets, and
brief, structured interactions reached about 25% of the
population in intervention counties. Multiweek parentingcourses were available for parents who needed support that
was more intensive. The combination of kernels and pro-
grams, where needed, signiﬁcantly reduced child-abusereports, medical injuries, and out-of-home foster placement
(Prinz et al. accepted ).
In sum, in addition to empirically supported programs
coming into wider use, we foresee the spread of kernels
into the repertoires of many change agents for situations
without designed programs and those where the problem
does not require a multicomponent program.
Reducing the Cost of Beneﬁcially Inﬂuencing Behavior
Making kernels widely available to behavior–inﬂuence
agents may reduce the cost of bringing about widespread
use of effective practices. Most of the kernels we identifyare in the public domain, easy to adopt, and useful across
many situations. Their dissemination requires no expensive
materials. Training in their use can be accomplished muchmore cheaply (often simply by modeling or deﬁning) than
training in complex programs.
Since kernels are in the public domain, it discourages
certain types of proﬁt-motivated dissemination. For
example, despite strong evidence of its efﬁcacy for diverse
problems, omega-3 (ﬁsh oil) offers little incentive topharmaceutical companies to market it for treatment of
bipolar disorder, post-partum depression, depression,
developmental disabilities, or aggression.
Nevertheless, viable business models exist that would
motivate dissemination of kernels. It is possible to make
access to information about kernels a commodity sold onthe Internet at low cost. Indeed, video modeling of—and
supporting materials for—kernels could be available
through iTunes, amazon.com, or e-bay. Alternatively, somekernels could be available at drug stores, supermarkets, or
video rental stores. Workplaces, local governments, and
other potential beneﬁciaries of kernels might well becomebulk purchasers or distributors of kernels that they90 Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113
123
calculate will affect health, safety, competitiveness, or
other important outcomes.
Using Kernels Across Developmental Stages
The example kernels in this paper have utility with par-
ticular ages or developmental periods. Table 2includes
kernels with experimental evidence across multipledevelopmental stages, those predicted to be useful for ages
for which they have not undergone testing, and those
without data or clear hypotheses about their utility for
developmental stages except the ones on which they have
been tested. We will show kernels that are effective acrossmultiple age ranges.
Implications of Kernels for Policy
The evidence on kernels points to the possibility that pol-
icies requiring or promoting the use of some kernels may
be appropriate. For example, peer-to-peer tutoring of Title1 students in ﬁrst grade increases long-term academic
success into middle school (Greenwood 1991a ,b). Creating
a federal, state, or district policy to use peer-to-peertutoring in Title 1 schools or at-risk areas theoretically
could raise academic performance and reduce historical
racial, ethnic, and cultural disparities (Greenwood 1991a ,
b)—without adopting a new curriculum. Communities or
school districts with high rates of dropping out in ninth
grade might consider making a policy around using the 15-min motivational process in seventh grade that improves
grades in ninth grade (Cohen et al. 2006 ). Another kernel,
taking omega-3 (cod liver oil) during pregnancy increasesthe child IQ at age 4 (Helland et al. 2003 ). The evidence
justiﬁes a policy for providing free omega-3 to pregnant
and post-partum mothers via Women, Infants, and Children(e.g., Helland et al. 2003 ; Hibbeln et al. 2006 ; Richardson
2006 ). The American Psychiatric Association recently
created a policy recommending at least 1 g/day of omega-3for all psychiatric patients (Freeman et al. 2006b ), which is
an example of a professional organization adopting a
kernel.
Some Concerns About Kernels
Some argue that kernels are useful only if their effects are
lasting. Numerous kernels do have such effects. For
example, the errorless-compliance training kernel has at
least a 6-month maintenance of effects for parent–childpairs coming from violent homes (Ducharme et al. 2000 )
and for children diagnosed with autism (Ducharme and
Drain 2004 ). The safe playing kernel (Embry 1984 ) has
reduced dangerous behavior 9 months after parentsTable 2 Kernel utility across age groups

implemented the strategy at home. Peer-to-peer tutoring
has effects that last from ﬁrst-grade intervention throughmiddle school (Greenwood 1991a ,b). Omega-3 supple-
mentation of cod liver oil during pregnancy has effects on
children’s cognitive development at least through age 4.Emotional writing reduces or prevents medication use,
healthcare visits, or continued unemployments months later
(Richards et al. 2000 ; Smyth et al. 1999 ; Spera et al.
1994 ). Response slates—as opposed to having students
raise their hands—improve performance on academicmeasures of retention, recall, and end-of-term tests for that
content (Christle and Schuster 2003 ; Kellum et al. 2001 ).
Finally, a 15-min motivational interview on paper has an18-month lasting effect on the improvement of grades of
high-risk African American students from seventh grade to
ninth grade (Cohen et al. 2006 ).
Yet even if a kernel does not seem to have a lasting
impact, we should not overlook its value. In numerous
situations, parents, teachers, youth workers, and othersneed to inﬂuence a behavior. For example, if the only
evidence for response slates was that they increased
classroom participation (Christle and Schuster 2003 ; Kel-
lum et al. 2001 ), they would be valuable to teachers who
want to raise classroom participation. In general, providing
people with simple and reliable ways of inﬂuencingbehavior is an important beneﬁt for them, even with no
current evidence that the impact is long lasting. Put anotherway, if we wish to create a society with high levels of
caring and effective guidance in all areas, the widespread
dissemination of kernels could help in this quest.
Another concern might be that kernels needed daily or
weekly are futile. Yet to exclude from the approved
armamentarium of prevention any strategies that do not
permanently change behavior seems odd both scientiﬁcallyand practically. Such a stance would exclude taking a daily
aspirin to prevent strokes and heart attacks; using UV
lotion to prevent skin cancer before going outside; con-
ducting daily physical activity to prevent obesity, health
problems, and depression; using a car seat each trip toprotect an infant, etc. From a contextual standpoint,
behavior is always, to some extent, a function of the
immediate environment (e.g., Biglan 1995 ). In order to
ensure that the environment promotes prosocial behavior
through kernels is a useful way to improve human
wellbeing.
Population-level Prevention
The literature reports two tracks of parenting interventions:
brief solution focused and general parent training, each
with experimental evidence supporting its efﬁcacy. Solu-
tion-focused parenting involves brief interventions thatmay be kernels like safe playing or good shopper; others
may be to-the-point recipes for going to restaurants, bed-
wetting, cleaning up, doing homework, getting ready forbed, etc., showing experimentally controlled results (e.g.,
Dadds et al. 1984 ; Sanders et al. 1984 ). The more general
strategies—8-to-12 week courses focusing on generalparenting skills with high-risk populations—also have
positive results (e.g., Hoath and Sanders 2002 ).
Recently, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control sup-
ported an RCT of a combined solution-focused and
general-parenting skill model to prevent child abuse in 18
South Carolina counties (Prinz et al. accepted ). In counties
receiving the multilevel parenting model (e.g., Sanders
et al. 2003 ), most of the utilization of services was for the
solution-focused kernels or recipes and not for the inten-sive services, yet the intervention produced signiﬁcant
reductions in substantiated child maltreatment reports,
child maltreatment-related medical injuries, and out-of-home placements (Prinz et al. accepted ). It may seem
counterintuitive that these simple and narrowly focused
strategies could produce such effects, but many acts ofchild maltreatment happen precisely during the types of
activities addressed by the solution-focused interven-
tions—getting ready, mealtimes, homework, chores,bedtimes, etc. The defusion of the brief kernel-like recipes
to solve these problems for thousands of parents in these
communities makes further sense when one understandsthat ofﬁcial reports of child physical maltreatmentTable 2 continued

underestimate its prevalence by 40 times (Theodore et al.
2007 ), making logistics and stafﬁng for intensive parenting
courses clearly impractical and improbable for thousands
of families at any given time in a community or county.
The South Carolina experiment suggests that providing
individuals access to self-selected simple preventative
strategies could have large implications for public healthand safety. The study hints that science-based prevention of
behavioral issues could be an individual consumer product.
Currently, individuals cannot access best practice preven-
tion programs, as they can consume products for child
safety, such as car seats, bike helmets, or safety guards forelectric sockets or kitchen cabinets.
Improving the Effectiveness of Prevention
and Treatment
Eddy ( 2006 ) has noted that intervention research does not
contribute to the extent it could to improve our under-standing of basic psychological and social processes that
interventions must target. In most cases, we have no
models of preventive interventions to show which social orpsychological processes they target, the effects of the
intervention on those targets, and the effects of changes in
these targets on outcomes. As a result, we have notdeveloped a robust and generalizable theory of the key
aspects of human functioning and the ways in which to
affect them. We can therefore say little about how toconstruct new interventions in new problem areas and
cannot easily communicate to nonscientists what they
might do for novel problems. All we can say is ‘‘apply thisprogram.’’ However, often there are no evidence-based
programs to apply.
A theoretical analysis that pinpoints speciﬁc procedures
to inﬂuence behavior and psychological processes would
stimulate research to reﬁne and improve these component
strategies and encourage creation of new, more effectiveprograms, and practices. Specifying fundamental units of
behavioral inﬂuence could point to components to add to
the existing programs and provide building blocks forcreating new and more powerful programs. We propose
that kernels are candidate building blocks for a generaliz-
able science of intervention and prevention. The next fewparagraphs, therefore, loop back to the conditions that gave
rise to the need for a taxonomy of active ingredients of
science-based prevention and treatment (Embry 2004 ) and
discussed early in this paper, showing how existing evi-
dence-based programs can be analyzed or strengthened by
kernels.
In order to illustrate how we created one evidenced-
based program using kernels, we brieﬂy outline the active
ingredients of PeaceBuilders (Embry et al. 1996 ), con-
structed by using previously validated kernels (Embryet al. 1996 ; Embry 1997 ). Note we did not have the lan-
guage for kernels then, but quite consciously used the
principle of kernels in the program design. There were ﬁve
core kernels in PeaceBuilders. First, the children and adultsreceived a framing language repertoire via a self-modeling
story kernel, which we had tested for its impact on
behavior. Second, children and adults created a vision ofpeaceful behavior using a goal/node map kernel. Third,
adults and children adopted an adjectival identity noun
kernel, ‘‘I am a PeaceBuilder.’’ Fourth, adults and children
learned to use praise notes or ‘‘caught-you-being good’’
notes for reinforcing behaviors deﬁned earlier in the self-modeling stories. At the same time, adults learned to use
the positive-home note kernel to support the reinforcement
of these same peacebuilding behaviors. Fifth, classroomsand schools received public recognition and posting for
engaging in peacebuilding behaviors or creating peace-
building ‘‘inventions’’ each week. Weekly walk-throughsof the school allowed monitoring of these active kernels.
This combination of kernels was tested in a randomized
control design over several years, and showed reductions inactual violent injuries (Krug et al. 1997 ), increased social
competence and resiliency measures, as well as reduced
aggression and inattention (Flannery et al. 2003 ). It affec-
ted the high-risk students the most (Vazsonyi et al. 2004 ).
The selection and use of kernels in PeaceBuilders is an
example of how kernels can both construct an interventionand clearly specify the putative ingredients.
In order to illustrate how kernels can clarify why pro-
grams work, we examine the Good Behavior Game (GBG),not created with kernels in mind. The GBG has already
increased cooperative on-task behavior in school signiﬁ-
cantly (Barrish et al. 1969 ; Medland and Stachnik 1972 )
and reduced antisocial behavior and smoking in adoles-
cence and adulthood (Kellam et al. 2008 ,1994 ; Kellam
and Anthony 1998 ). Its core kernels include a response cost
for negative behavior (e.g., Conyers et al. 2004 ); team
competition (e.g., Beersma et al. 2003
); public posting of
results (e.g., Parsons 1982 ); and team rotations (deemed
critical but with no supporting study). Additional kernels
include a low emotional response to negative behaviors
(e.g., Abramowitz et al. 1987 ), playing three games per
day, and using beat the timer (e.g., Adams and Drabman
1995 ).
The GBG also provides an occasion to describe the
utility of kernels in helping disseminate programs. Until
2003, when the ﬁrst author started collaborating with Johns
Hopkins, there was virtually no diffusion of the GBG basedon Kellam’s work or even earlier behavior analysis studies,
beyond journal articles. Inspection, direct replication, and
systematic replication in different settings of the GBG(Embry 2002 ) as implemented by Kellam and colleagues,
pointed to several ways that planned dissemination andClin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113 93
123
further testing underway at Johns Hopkins could strengthen
it. First, it was necessary to stop edible reinforcers used by
Kellam and colleagues, as social context and validity do
not support this 20 years later. A switch to a kernel ofprizes based on the Premack Principle (Andrews 1970 ;
Homme et al. 1963 ; Hosie et al. 1974 ; Premack 1962 ; Van
Hevel and Hawkins 1974 ) proved acceptable and rein-
forcing to children and adults alike.
Second, we added kernels to improve adoption, imple-
mentation, and maintenance of the GBG based on
observations and consumer feedback. These included non-
verbal cues (e.g., Cox et al. 2000 ; Rosenkoetter and Fowler
1986 ) to improve generalization and adoption of the Game
and meaningful roles as differential reinforcement of other
behaviors (e.g., Rutter 1981 ) to reduce accidental negative
attention. Another includes setting generalization recipes
for carrying over the GBG to hallways, restrooms, cafete-
ria, etc. (e.g., Fishbein and Wasik 1981 ) to improve
generalization by students and acceptability by adults.
Other kernels include symbolic self-modeling (e.g., Embry
et al. 1996 ) to improve imitation of behavior and school-
home notes (e.g., Kelley et al. 1988 ) for prompting family
reinforcement and generalization of behavior to home.
Others are peer-to-peer praise notes (e.g., Skinner et al.2000 ) to improve social competence and reduce negative
peer attention, and the good behavior lottery (e.g., Putnam
et al. 2003) to increase generalization when not playing theGame. Inserting these kernels provided a more systematic
approach to address the issues of diffusion of scientiﬁc
innovation, raised by Rogers ( 1995 ), of relative advantage,
compatibility, ease of use, trialability, and observability.
Kernels may also be useful in strengthening existing
programs. Several investigations have noted problemsreplicating the results of Project Alert in community con-
texts (e.g., St. Pierre et al. 2005 ). In Houston, an agency
requested assistance from the ﬁrst author for improvingimplementation of Project Alert in the context of gym
classes—they had never tested it scientiﬁcally but it was
the only slot available in the school day. Attendance waspoor and pre–post assessments did not show that the pro-
gram affected the students. We recommended use of
several kernels in order to make attendance more rein-forcing and the lessons more participatory, and to create
peer pressure for attendance: prize-bowl, random calling,
peer-to-peer tutoring, tootle notes, response slates, pleasantgreetings to students by program staff in the halls, and
student jobs. In year-to-year comparisons, attendance
doubled, increasing to 90% in most of the schools. More-over, for the ﬁrst time, students achieve the target scores
for the post-tests proposed to measure dose and ﬁdelity by
the developers of Project Alert.
The analysis of kernels can also help construct new
interventions by putting together a set of kernels that allappear relevant and useful for new problems. For example,
methamphetamine addiction is a serious public-health
problem and there is a dearth of evidence-based programs
to reduce it (Embry et al. 2005 ). Table 3outlines a
potential community- or state-level response to metham-
phetamine use via evidenced-based kernels. The table
tackles the huge public health problem that arises frommeth-exposed infants or children who enter the medical,
social service, and legal systems as well as intervention,
prevention, and treatment issues associated with teens or
adults using or at risk for using methamphetamine.
Of course, such a constructed program demands experi-
mental evaluation via randomized trials or at least via quasi-
experimental studies. At the same time, however, practitio-
ners and policymakers desperate to deal with themethamphetamine problem must have a strategy, that,
although not yet evaluated in an RCT, is composed of ele-
ments, each one shown in prior experimental work in RCT orinterrupted time series to affect its target behaviors. The
bundled kernels to address this public health and safety
problem could face testing in an interrupted time-seriesdesign across neighborhoods, communities, or counties
using naturally occurring archival data on meth-related
crimes, arrests, emergency-room care use, or child removals.
The theoretical analysis of kernels also may help to
develop new kernels. In essence, the framework suggests
that, in any instance requiring altered behavior, it will payto examine systematically whether it is possible to alter
consequences or antecedents for the behavior, if it is pos-
sible to inﬂuence relational responding in ways that changethe value of relevant behaviors, and ﬁnally, whether
physiological interventions could alter the probability of
behavior. A thorough understanding of existing kernels
would contribute to the success of this effort.
Prevention science might also gain strength by mapping
kernels onto risk and protective factors. For instance, muchresearch points to early antisocial behavior, school bond-
ing, and inadequate parental monitoring as predictors of
various adverse outcomes (Arthur et al. 2002 ; Dekovic
1999 ; Duncan et al. 2000 ). Numerous kernels are relevant
to affect these constructs. Examples include the percentage
of students with meaningful roles in a day, the squarefootage of student work displayed on the walls, the number
of peer-to-peer positive written notes, the caught-you-being
good notes, or positive notes home (Rutter 1981 ). Articu-
lating the kernels relevant to each risk or protective factor
would provide practitioners with more precise guidance as
to which kernels are most useful for altering key risk andprotective factors.
Thinking in terms of kernels may also facilitate our
identifying kernel-like practices that occur naturally insociety, as has already happened in some cases. For
example, epidemiological studies show that omega-394 Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev (2008) 11:75–113
123
consumption was associated with many important health
and behavior outcomes, such as reduced CVD, depres-sion, and homicide (Hibbeln 2001 ,2002 ; Hibbeln et al.
2007 ; McGrath-Hanna et al. 2003 ; Tanskanen et al.
2001 ). Then intervention studies showed that changes in
the consumption of omega-3 reduced these types of
adverse conditions (Freeman et al. 2006a ; Gesch et al.2002 ). In a similar vein, epidemiologists can use existing
evidence about kernels to examine whether kernels occurnaturally in social systems and beneﬁt the population.
Such research would strengthen the link between epide-
miology and intervention research and practice, whilestrengthening empirically based theory about human
development.Table 3 Applying kernel to community-level methamphetamine addiction issues

A Database Repository of Kernels
In the interest of fostering the dissemination and further
development of kernels, we propose a database repositoryof kernels, analogous to the human genome project, which
might be called the behaviornome. Initially, it would
contain the kernels that Table 1lists and would enable
people to describe additional kernels and empirical evi-
dence regarding their effects. The database would allow a
user to search for speciﬁc kernels or to identify a behaviorand search for kernels relevant to inﬂuence the behavior.
We are hopeful that this repository will provide detailed
information about how kernels inﬂuence behavior, thecircumstances in which they do or do not work, and any
iatrogenic effects, potential positive or negative combina-
tions of kernels not documented presently, variations ofkernels related to cultures or other establishing conditions,
and proximal and distal behavioral effects. In time, the
database would have hyperlinks to PsychInfo or PubMed.We expect the repository to help reduce the cost of bene-
ﬁcially inﬂuencing behavior and improving the efﬁcacy of
prevention and treatment practice and theory.
Summary
Kernels are fundamental units of behavior–inﬂuence tech-
nology. They provide a wealth of resources for those trying
to inﬂuence human behavior in beneﬁcial ways. The four
primary mechanisms of kernels are providing conse-quences for behavior, establishing antecedent stimuli for
behavior, altering people’s relational framing about tar-
geted behaviors, and altering physiology that affectsbehavior. Understanding the range and effectiveness of
kernels could contribute to the public-health goals of
decreasing the prevalence of problems and increasingwellbeing. Kernels could provide behavior–inﬂuence
agents with a wider array of effective practices. Denomi-
nation of kernels could clarify the active components ofexisting programs. It could also lead to the development of
new programs composed entirely of effective kernels.
Finally, it could contribute to the development of anempirically based theory of behavior inﬂuence consistent
with current knowledge of risk and protective factors and
that clariﬁes the mechanisms through which behaviorinﬂuence occurs.
