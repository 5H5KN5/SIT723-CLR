Many self-directed weight-loss in terventions have been develope d using a variety of delivery 
formats (e.g. internet, smartphone) and change t echniques. Yet, little research has examined 
whether self-directed interventions can ex clusively promote weight loss. MEDLINE, 
Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were systematically reviewed for 
randomised controlled trials eval uating self-directed interventions in relation to weight loss 
outcomes in adults. Standard mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
were calculated using a random effects mode l. Twenty-seven tria ls incorporating 36 
comparisons met our inclusion criteria. Participants using self-directed interventions lost significantly more weight ( MD = -1.56 kg, CI -2.25, -0.86 ranging from 0.6 to 5.3 kg) 
compared to those in the minimal-interven tion or no-treatment groups (3.1-month follow-up 
median). The majority of interventions were internet-based (18 evaluations) and these were effective at 3 months ( MD = -1.74 kg, CI -2.65, -0.82 ranging from 0.6 to 4.8 kg) ( SMD  = -
0.48, 95% CI -0.72, -0.24,  I² = 82%; p < .0001; 16 evaluations) and 6 months follow-up ( MD 
= -2.71 kg, CI -4.03, -1.39 rangi ng from 2.2 to 5.3 kg) ( SMD  = -0.59, 95% CI -0.99, -0.19, I ² 
= 76%; p = .004; 4 evaluations). Self-directed weight -loss interventions can generate modest 
weight loss for up to 6 months but may need to be supplemented by other interventions to 
achieve sustained and clinically  meaningful weight loss.

Self-directed interventions to promote weight loss:  
a systematic review and meta-analysis 
Introduction 
Being overweight or obese is associated with multiple health risks including cardiovascular 
disease and a range of cancers, which account for many premature d eaths (Allender, Peto, 
Scarborough, Boxer, & Rayner, 2006; Whitlock et al., 2009). Yet the prevalence of obesity worldwide has more than doubled since 1980, incr easing ill health, mort ality and healthcare 
costs. In the United States (US), for exampl e, 68% of adults ar e overweight or obese, 
accounting for more than 20% of health care co sts (Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Curtin, 2010) 
while in the United Kingdom (UK),  62% of adults are overwei ght or obese (Health and 
Social Care Information Cent re, 2015), and it has been pr edicted that by 2050, 40% of the 
population could be obese, resulting in hea lth and social costs of £49.9 billion (US$76.1 
billion) per annum (Butland et al., 2007). Weight control is, th erefore, a global public health 
priority (Finucane et al., 2011; World Health Organisation [WHO], 2014).  
Obesity-related health risks can be reduced substantially with weight loss of as little 
as 5% of body weight (Jensen et al., 2014) and this may gene rate psychological benefits 
including improved health-related quality of  life, body image and depression (Blaine, 
Rodman, & Newman, 2007; Busch et al., 2013; Lasikiewicz, Myrissa, Hoyland, & Lawton, 
2014). In the US, the Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention have developed clear 
policies promoting weight loss and prevention of weight-related illness (e.g. Leeman et al., 
2012). Similarly, UK public health policy advoca tes weight loss through individual lifestyle 
change (Department of Health [DoH], 2013; Natio nal Institute of Health  and Care Excellence 
[NICE], 2014). Self-directed inte rventions may facilitate econom ical implementation of these 
policies, because, if effective, they are more likely to be cost-effective and have much wider 
reach than, for example, face-to-face individual or group interventions.

By “self-directed interventions”, we mean  those requiring no professional contact or 
no contact beyond an introductory face-to-face se ssion. Such interventions require users to 
self-regulate and generate change without prof essional assistance. They can be implemented 
with existing infrastructure and staffing and embedded in users’ everyday lives. Many such 
interventions have been developed (Arem & Irwin, 2011). Attrition rates can be high 
(Eysenbach, 2005)—for example, in one study, only 30% of subscribed participants reported use of a website program after 52 weeks (N eve, Collins and Morgan (2010)—but evidence 
suggests that such interventions can promot e weight-loss and can augment face-to-face 
weight-loss interventions (Tang, Abraham, Greaves, & Yates, 2014; Wieland et al., 2012). In a review of reviews, Tang et al. (2014) found that self -directed interventions employ 
particular change techniques in cluding individualised feedback and online social support to 
enhance effectiveness. These authors concluded that further reviews of primary level studies 
should clearly categorise interventions by m ode of delivery and investigate features 
associated with increased effectiveness.  
Information technology advances have allowe d development of interactive systems, 
which can be adapted to individual users’  needs and preferences. These have been 
incorporated in a wide range of electronic interventions usi ng various digital platforms (e.g. 
smartphones, tablets, and tracker bracelets). De livered online and offline, these interventions 
can emulate elements of face- to-face interactions by, for exam ple, prompting goal-setting, 
instructing progress monitoring and providing tim ely goal-related feedback (McEwan et al., 
2016). By scaffolding self-regulation, such interventions may facilitate cognitive and affective change that underpins changes in weight-gain behaviour pa tterns (Kessler, 2009). 
Social support and social comparison can also be provided through message boards and 
online chat sessions. The use of self-regulat ory prompts and social support provision are

associated with weight loss effectiveness in face-to-face weight loss programmes (Greaves et 
al., 2011) but it is unclear if they have a sim ilar effect in self-dir ected interventions.  
Self-directed interventions are likely to be less costly than f ace-to-face services and 
could have greater public health impact, but ev idence for their effectiveness remains unclear 
(Harris et al., 2011; Manzoni, Pagnini, Corti, Molinari, & Castelnuovo, 2011; Turk et al., 
2009). A recent review of reviews synthesised the findings on effectiveness of self-directed 
interventions (Tang et al., 2014) . Twenty relevant reviews provided mixed but promising 
findings, for example, one review found a significant average increase of up to 1.5kg in weight loss over evaluation periods when intern et-based interventions were delivered in 
conjunction with standard weight loss treatm ent (Reed, Schifferdecker, Rezaee, O'Connor, & 
Larson, 2012). Another review found evidence that computer-based interventions were 
effective in promoting weight loss and reduced weight regain (Wieland et al., 2012). Weight 
loss across all evaluations reviewed ranged fr om 0.8-7.8kg but most reviews advised caution 
in interpretation of findings because of vari ability in intervention content and delivery. 
Most narrative reviews and meta-analyses have  combined self-directed interventions with 
those including face-to-face, online and group sessions. For example, Hutchesson et al. 
(2015) found that eHealth weight -loss interventions could gene rate significantly greater 
weight loss than minimal interventions. Th is is encouraging bu t the 183 interventions 
considered in this review included a variet y of delivery formats in cluding self-directed 
interventions and those that i nvolve regular online profession al contact (e.g. via emails). 
Further review work is needed to clarify whether self-directed in terventions, without 
professional contact, can promote weight loss.  
   Hartmann-Boyce, Jebb, Fletcher, and Aveyard (2015) undertook meta-analyses to 
assess weight loss generated by “self-help” interv entions compared to minimal controls. They 
concluded, encouragingly, that self-help interv entions can effectivel y promote weight loss

(MD = -1.85 kg) and called for further progress to understand and improve such 
interventions. Hartmann-Boyce et al. (2015)  focused on overweight and obese populations 
and evaluated weight loss (kg) at between 6 to 12 months follow up. They also included 
“self-help” interventions involving ongoing online professional contact. 
The Present Study 
Our focus is on interventions that do not i nvolve ongoing professional contact. We include 
interventions that involve one face-to-face intro ductory session but no further contact. We are 
interested in the capacity of such interventions to promote weight loss, not only among those 
who are already overweight, but also, preven tatively, among normal weight and sedentary 
populations. While focusing primaril y on weight loss, we are also interested in weight-related 
outcomes such as BMI and waist circumfere nce and on short, medium and longer term 
effects. In addition, we are interested to di scover if different delivery modes (e.g., online 
versus paper-based) and in clusion of particular comm only-used change techniques 
differentiate between more or less effective self-directed interventions.  
Research Questions 
This review addressed th ree research questions: 
(1) How effective are self-direc ted interventions (without ongoi ng professional contact) 
in promoting short, medium and l ong-term weight loss in adults?  
(2) Are particular modes of deliv ery of self-directed weight-l oss interventions more or 
less effective?   
(3) Do particular, frequently employed cha nge techniques enhance effectiveness? 
Methods  
Inclusion criteria  
Downloaded by [2.124.227.49] at 11:47 19 April 2016 

7 
 
We included articles published in English before and during July 2014 that reported 
randomised controlled trials (RCT) of self -directed weight-loss or weight-control 
interventions.  
Intervention Characteristics 
Included trials evaluated interventions that: 
1. targeted either physical activity, diet or both, 
2. were self-directed with no more than one face-to-face contact (e.g. an introductory or 
instructional session lasting no longer than 90 minutes), 
3. included at least one interactive component involving engaging users with the 
interface (e.g. entering personal data in response to prompts), 
4. included at least one self-regulatory elem ent involving users reflecting on their 
thoughts or behaviour patterns (such as diary keeping, goal- setting or goal-review).  
Outcome Measures 
Trials included one or more of  the following outcome measures:  
1. body weight (kilograms or pounds) 
2. body mass index (BMI) kg/m² 
3. waist circumference (inches or centimetres) 
Comparison groups 
Trials  were included if they compared self-dir ected weight loss in terventions to a no 
intervention or minimal interven tion control grou p including:  
1. usual care 
2. minimal interventions (e.g. provision of information) 
3. educational materials (b oth online and paper) 
4. no intervention (wait-list control)

Trials were included if th ey were conducted with:   
1. healthy adults (18 years or ove r) including those at risk of diabetes (but not diagnosed 
with diabetes or other long-term illnesses) who were not taking medications which 
could affect weight, 
2. people who were of normal we ight, overweight or obese 
Search strategy 
  
We used the Cochrane PICOS (participant , intervention, comparison and outcome, study 
design) method to formulate our search criteria. Details of the search st rategy are available in 
Supplementary Table 1. Searches were conduc ted in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), 
PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL, and the Cochrane Libr ary. We also searched the references of 
included articles to identify further trials. All titles and abstracts retrieved from electronic 
searches were exported into reference manage ment Endnote X4 software before the removal 
of duplicate articles.  
The first author examined the titles and ab stracts of articles identified by our search 
against the above inclusion criteria. A second researcher checked the quality and accuracy of 
study selection by screening (a randomly selected) 10% of availabl e titles and abstracts. Full 
text copies of the selected relevant articles were obtained and checked against the inclusion criteria by the first author and by two additiona l researchers. Disagreements were resolved 
through discussion and reasons for exclusion were recorded for each article (See Supplementary Table 2). 
Quality assessment of Included Studies 
We used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool (Higgins et al., 2011) to assess risk of 
bias in the included articles. Judgements were  made on the following seven items to assess 
selection, performance, detec tion, attrition, and reporting bias, namely: (1) Was the random 
sequence adequately generated? (2) Was the allocation adequately concealed? (3) Was

knowledge of trial arm allocation blinded from participants and pers onnel during the study? 
(4) Was knowledge of trial arm allocation b linded from outcome a ssessors? (5) Were any 
issues of incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? (6) Were repor ts of the study free 
of suggestion of selective outcome reporting ? (7) Was the study apparently free of other 
problems that could put it at a hi gh risk of bias? Each article was judged to have ‘unclear’, 
‘low’ or ‘high’ risk of bias  in relation to each of these questions. A second researcher 
checked a random selection of 50% of articles for risk of bias and discrepancies were 
discussed and resolved. 
Data extraction 
 
From each article, we extracted basic info rmation concerning: Setting and methods (e.g. 
country, year, context, blinding, study design, bias); participants (e.g. total number of 
participants, missing participants, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria); participant 
characteristics (e.g. mean age, sex); comparis on groups (e.g., usual care  or no-intervention); 
outcome measures (e.g. primary outcome measur e, secondary measure, method of assessing 
outcomes, duration of follow up); main findi ngs; (e.g. type of cognitive, emotional, 
behavioural or physiological cha nges targeted and or assessed  in process evaluations) and 
mode of delivery (e.g. internet, smartphone, l eaflets, multicomponent, DVD).  In addition, we 
coded intervention descriptions for inclusion of  specific change techniques. We identified 12 
previously defined change techniques that were  included in at least one of the evaluated 
interventions (Abraham & K ools, 2012; Abraham & Michie , 2008; Albarracín et al., 2005; 
Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009). These were (1) highlighting affective consequences of be havioural choices, (2) instruction to enhance decision-making 
skills, (3) prompting goal set ting, (4) self-monitoring (5) provi ding feedback, (6) teaching use 
of reminders, (7) identif ication of behavioural cues and prompts, (8) modelling behaviours, 
(9) providing instructions to enhance behavi oural skills, (10) provi ding social comparison

opportunities, (11) prompting soci al support or social network formation, and (12) prompting 
group identity formation. When a technique was identified in an intervention description, a 
further judgement was made as to whether it wa s tailored to the participant or participant’s 
group or delivered in a generic manner. A second researcher checked a random selection of 
the interventions (50% of interventions included  in meta-analysis) for change techniques and 
discrepancies were discussed and resolved. The kappa and AC1 statistic were used to assess 
inter-rater agreement (Gwet, 2002).  
We also extracted outcome data for meta-analyses and for methodological quality 
assessment (using Cochrane Risk of Bias T ool) (see Supplementary Table 3 for full data 
extraction form). 
Analyses  
We followed the quality criteria specifie d by the PRISMA checkli st for reporting of 
systematic review and meta-analyses (Higgins  & Green, 2011). All meta-analyses and forest 
plots were generated using RevMan (version 5.3). Effect sizes were reported as standardised 
mean differences ( SMD ), the equivalent of Hedge’s g, that is, the mean difference in weight 
loss between the control and intervention gr oup divided by the pooled standard deviation, 
averaged across studies, along w ith 95% confidence intervals. These were calculated using 
random effects models to account for the assump tion that different studies estimate different 
or heterogeneous true interven tion effects. As a sensitivity analysis, we investigated the 
underlying effects sizes under a fixe d effect model that assumes th at all studies included in 
the meta-analyses are estimating the same, but unknown, intervention effect. When SMDs were found to be significant, we reported the weighted average additional weight lost in the 
intervention groups, per participan t, over and above that lost in  the control groups (i.e. the 
MD between intervention and control group), an d the range of average additional loss across 
interventions. To avoid double-counting of participants and to account for the correlation of

multiple evaluations in studies, where two or mo re interventions were compared to the same 
control group from the same population, we com puted a single effect size as the average for 
multiple evaluations and a variance that take s into account the correlation between multiple 
evaluations (Borenstein, He dges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 200 9; Higgins & Green, 2011). 
These included five articles containing two ev aluations (Brindal et al., 2012; Collins et al., 
2012; Lally, Chipperfield, & Wardle, 2008; Morgan et al., 2013; Napolitano, Hayes, Bennett, 
Ives, & Foster, 2013), and one study containing three evaluations (Gow, Trace, & Mazzeo, 2010).  
All weight-related outcomes were converted  into the same unit of measurement for 
meta-analysis (e.g. lbs to kg or in ches to cm). In articles wher e standard deviations were not 
available, using formulas recommended by Co chrane Collaboration guidelines (Higgins & 
Green, 2011), confidence intervals (CI) and standard  errors (SE) were co nverted into standard 
deviations for change in we ight from baseline to follow-up (SD). We ensured that 
heterogeneity of variance was minimised by co mbining only studies using similar modes of 
delivery and outcomes. Inspections of funnel plots generated by RevMan were used to examine possible publication bias. Following Wi eland et al. (2012), we examined outcomes 
at the following time points: 4 months or le ss; greater than 4 but less than 12 months; 12 
months or more.   
Meta-analyses were performed to assess th e effectiveness of included self-directed 
interventions in promoting weight loss (kg), reducing Body Mass Index (BMI) and 
decreasing waist circumference (cm). To asse ss overall effectiveness we pooled weight-
related outcomes at final follow-up. We th en performed subgroup analyses to assess 
effectiveness at defined follow-up points to examine effectiveness over time. Meta-analyses were also performed to examine the effec tiveness of interventi ons including change

techniques compared to those without cha nge techniques. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to assess the imp act of outlier studies.  
Results 
Our search identified 3884 references for title and abstract screen ing, excluding duplicates. 
This generated 232 potentially eligible articles for full text examination of which 25 satisfied 
our inclusion criteria. Two additional eligible articles were identified by searching references of included articles, resulti ng in a final sample of 27
1(see Figure 1).  
Second coding of articles for study selec tion showed good reliability with 100% 
agreement on title and abstract (n = 368) and full-text article (n = 23) selection. Most 
excluded articles did not evaluate self-direc ted interventions and many did not have an 
appropriate comparison group (see Supplementary Ta ble 2 for a list of excluded articles).

Study characteristics  
Supplementary Table 4 presents study char acteristics for the 27 included articles 
reporting 36 RCT evaluations of self-directe d interventions. Two interventions included 
introductory face-to-face sessions lasting no up to 75 minutes (Morgan, Lubans, Collins, 
Warren, & Callister, 2011a; Morgan et al., 2011b). 
The majority of studies were conducted in the US, Australia and the Netherlands. A 
variety of samples were use d, but most recruited community participants while others 
                                                            
1 In the course of analyses and publication, an updated sear ch up to November (2015) identified two further studies that 
would have been included in our review appeared in the li terature. These are: (1) Blomfield, R. L., Collins, C. E., 
Hutchesson, M. J., Young, M. D. , Jensen, M. E., Callister, R. , & Morgan, P. J. (2014). Impact of self-help weight loss 
resources with or without on line support on the dietary intake of overwei ght and obese men: Th e SHED-IT randomised

in Morgan et al. (2013), which we included in our meta-analysis, and the latter reported an effe ct size well-within the range 
reported in the studies included in our meta analyses. Thus while it will be interesti ng to update this review as the literatur e 
grows, the findings are current to July 2014.

recruited from work places and universities. The total number of participants randomised 
included across all trials was 28,500, of which 71% were female with a mean age of 41. Four 
articles comprising six relevant evaluations included exclusivel y female samples (Jacobi et 
al., 2007; Levine et al., 2007; Low et al., 2006; Mouttapa et al., 2011) and four articles 
containing five evaluations were exclusiv ely male (Morgan, Lubans, Collins, Warren, & 
Callister, 2011a; Morgan et al., 2011b; Mo rgan et al., 2013; Veverka et al., 2003).  
Eleven articles including 17 ev aluations targeted overwei ght and obese participants 
and five articles recruited sede ntary participants. Twenty-thr ee articles focused on weight 
loss, while three articles targeted weight  maintenance (Kelders, van Gemert-Pijnen, 
Werkman, & Seydel, 2010; Gow et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2008) and only one study 
assessed weight loss and weight maintenance (van Genugten et al., 2012). Seven articles 
included two interventions arms and a minimal intervention or no treatment control (Brindal 
et al., 2012; Collins et al., 2012; Lally et al., 2008; Levine et al., 2007;  Morgan et al., 2013; 
Napolitano et al., 2013; Schroder, 2010), two ar ticles had three intervention arms and a 
minimal intervention or no trea tment control (Gow et al., 201 0; Low et al., 2006) and 18 
articles compared one intervention to a mini mal intervention or no treatment control.  
Twenty articles including 26 evaluations repo rted weight loss as an outcome. Fifteen 
articles comprising 19 evaluations assesse d BMI and eleven ar ticles containing 13 
evaluations reported waist circumference. Twen ty-six evaluations assessed outcomes at 1-4 
months, 17 evaluations assessed outcomes be tween 4 months and 12 months and seven 
assessed outcomes between 12 and 36 months, w ith some studies reporting outcomes at more 
than one follow-up point. Comparison groups in cluded 9 no-treatment, 10 wait-list controls, 7 
provision of information or minimal interventi ons and 1 usual care comparison. Three articles 
described physical activity interventions (Carr et al., 2008; Carr, Karvinen, Peavler, Smith, & 
Downloaded by [2.124.227.49] at 11:47 19 April 2016

Cangelosi, 2013; Hansen et al., 2012), and 24 in cluded interventions targeting both diet and 
physical activity.  
The majority of the interventions (29 of  the 36) were delivered primarily through 
internet use. Three were multi-component pr ogrammes (Carr et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 
2013; Werkman et al., 2010) by which we mean th at they employed more than one mode of 
delivery, for example, Morgan et al. ( 2013) employed a DVD-based programme and a 
pedometer. Two used mobile phones to delive r text messages (Haapala, Barengo, Biggs, 
Surakka, & Manninen, 2009; Shapiro et al., 2012) and one used leaflets (Lally et al., 2008).  
Supplementary Table 5 presents a list of change  techniques reported in at least five of 
the 36 self-directed interventions. Self-monitori ng was included in 30 (of 36) interventions 
(and was personalised in 26). Many interven tions reported the use of feedback (26 
interventions), goal-setting (19 interventions), social support/networks (19 interventions) and 
behavioural skill instruction (25 interventions). The least used techniques (of those observed) 
were group identity promotion and decision-ma king skills instruction of which both were 
identified in seven interventions. Interesti ngly, one intervention included 11 of the 12 
techniques in an internet-based format including weekly weight change visual feedback in the 
form of a graph and a social discussion forum (Gow et al., 2010). Based on 50% of the 
interventions included in the meta-analysis, the inter-rater agreement was high with kappa 
and AC1 values of 0.91 and 0.84, respectively. 
Risk of bias of included studies 
The inter-rater reliabil ity between two reviewers was high with 100% agreement on all risk of 
bias domains after discussion. Overall, study qu ality was low, with only three of the 27 
studies having a low risk of bias in at least fi ve of the seven main cat egories (Collins et al., 
2012; Morgan, Lubans, Collins, Warren, & Callister, 2011a ; Morgan et al., 2013). The quality 
of reporting was also low with only two studies reporting sufficient detail to fully assess risks

of bias (Morgan et al., 2013; Morgan, Lubans, Collins, Warren, & Callister, 2011a ) (see 
Supplementary Figure 1 & 2). The main risks of bias identified from study descriptions were 
failure to blind assessors (21 of  27 articles), failure to blind participants and personnel (20), 
not providing sufficient detail on allocation concealment (18), and inadequate reporting of 
randomisation procedures (11).  
Effectiveness of self-directed interventions  
Weight loss  Required data could be extracted for 25 evaluatio ns of weight loss. Figure 2 shows the mean 
and standard deviations for weight loss in the intervention and control groups for each 
included trial as well as the standard mean difference and corresponding forest plot. Similar 
supplementary tables are available for all me ta-analyses reported below. The results show 
that those using self-directed interventions lost  significantly more weight  than those receiving 
minimal intervention or no treatment ( MD = -1.56 kg, CI -2.25, -0.86) ( SMD  = -0.41, 95% CI 
-0.60, -0.23, I ² = 79%; p < .00001). Additional average weight  loss per participant in the 
intervention group ranged from 0.6 to 5.3 kg. Th e median follow-up time for this whole-
sample analysis was 3.1 months. Subgroup analyses  (Suppl. Figure 3) rev ealed similar weight 
loss at 0-4 months (3-month median) follow-up ( MD = -1.65 kg, CI -2.40, -0.89) ( SMD  = -
0.48, 95% CI -0.69, -0.27,  I² = 79%; p < .0001; 20 evaluations with additional average weight 
lost ranging from 0.6  to 4.8 kg per participant across interventions) and at 4-12 months (6-
month median) ( MD = -2.26 kg, CI -3.35, -1.18) ( SMD  = -0.48, 95% CI -0.76, -0.21, I² = 
67%; p = .0005; six evaluations with  additional average weight lost ranging from 1.7 to 5.3 
kg), but considerably less weight loss at 12 months or more (12-m onth median) follow-up 
(SMD  = -0.14, 95% CI -0.38, 0.10, I² = 55%; p = 0.24; five evaluations).

In the 16 evaluations assessing body mass index, participants rece iving self-directed 
interventions showed significantly greater re duction in BMI levels than those receiving 
minimal intervention or no treatment ( MD = -0.41 kg/m², CI -0.70, -0.11) ( SMD  = -0.28, 95% 
CI -0.53, -0.04, I ² = 88%; p = 0.02). Additional average loss of BMI points per participant in 
the intervention group ranged from 0.08 to 1.7 kg/m² (Suppl. Figure 4). The median follow-
up time for this whole-sample analysis was 3.1 months. Subgroup analyses (Suppl. Figure 5) 
revealed somewhat greater BMI reducti on at 0-4 months (3-month median) (MD  = -0.54 
kg/m², CI -0.88, -0.19) ( SMD  = -0.43, 95% CI -0.72, -0.13, I² = 87%; p = .004; 12 evaluations 
with additional average BMI loss ranging fr om 0.1 to 1.5 kg/m² per participant across 
interventions) than at 4- 12 months (6-month median) ( SMD  = -0.20, 95% CI -0.83, 0.43, I² = 
91%; p = 0.53; six evaluations) where BMI differen ces were non-significant . Insufficient data 
(only two evaluations) prevented subgroup analys es for BMI reduction at 12 months or more. 
Waist circumference outcomes 
 Twelve evaluations reported waist circumference and the me ta-analysis showed somewhat 
greater decreases in the self -directed interventi on group than those receiving minimal 
intervention or no treatment ( MD = -2.37 cm, CI -4.12, -0.61)  ( SMD  = -0.66, 95% CI -1.05, -
0.26, I ² = 94%; p = .001). Additional average lo ss of waist circumference per participant in 
the intervention group ranged from 0.1 to 6.3 cm (Suppl. Figure 6). The median follow-up 
time for this whole-sample analysis was 5 months. Subgroup analyses (Suppl. Figure 7) 
showed a significant reduction in waist circ umference at 0-4 months (3-month median) ( MD 
= -2.81 cm, CI -4.25, -1.37)  ( SMD  = -0.98, 95% CI -1.56, -0.39, I² = 95%; p = .001; nine 
evaluations with additional average waist circumference loss ranging from 0.1 to 5.2 cm 
across interventions), but not at 4-12 months (6-month median) ( SMD  = -0.24, 95% CI -1.07, 
0.59, I ² = 94%; p = 0.57; four evaluations). Insufficient data (only two evaluations) prevented 
subgroup analyses for waist circumfere nce reduction at 12 months or more.

Effectiveness of internet-based  self-directed interventions  
 
The majority of interventions (18 of 25, 72 %) included in the above  meta-analyses were 
internet-based. Participants receiving internet-based self-directed interventions lost 
significantly more weight than  those receiving minimal intervention or no treatment ( MD = -
1.72 kg, CI -2.60, -0.84) ( SMD  = -0.45, 95% CI -0.67, -0.23,  I² = 80%; p < .0001). Additional 
average weight loss per part icipant in the intervention group ranged from 0.59 to 5.3 kg 
(Suppl. Figure 8). The median follow-up time for this whole-sample analysis was 3 months. Subgroup analyses (Suppl. Figure 9)  showed significant weight lo ss results at 0-4 months (3-
month median) ( MD = -1.74 kg, CI -2.65, -0.82) ( SMD  = -0.48, 95% CI -0.72, -0.24, I² = 
82%; p < .0001; 16 evaluations with additional aver age weight lost ranging from 0.6 kg to 4.8 
kg per participant across interventions) and at 4-12 months (6-month median) ( MD = -2.71 
kg, CI -4.03, -1.39)  ( SMD = -0.59, 95% CI -0.99, -0.19, I² = 76%; p = .004; four evaluations 
with additional average weight lost ranging from 2.2 kg to 5.3 kg). Insufficient data (only two 
evaluations) prevented subgroup analyses fo r follow-up at 12 m onths or longer. 
 Similarly, participants receiving internet-bas ed self-directed interventions achieved a 
significantly greater reduction in BMI levels than those re ceiving no treatment or minimal 
intervention ( MD = -0.47 kg/m², CI -0.81, -0.14) ( SMD  = -0.32, 95% CI -0.61, -0.03, I² = 
90%; p = 0.03; 13 evaluations). Additional average loss of BMI points in the intervention 
group ranged from 0.08 to 1.7 kg/m² (Suppl. Figure  10). The median follow-up time for this 
whole-sample analysis was 3.1 months. Subgr oup analyses (Suppl. Figure 11) revealed a 
greater reduction of BMI at 0-4 months (3-month median) ( MD = -0.58 kg/m², CI -0.98, -
0.19) ( SMD  = -0.46, 95% CI -0.79, -0.13, I² = 89%; p = .006; 10 evaluations with additional 
average BMI loss ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 kg/m² pe r participant across in terventions) than at 
4-12 months (6-month median) ( SMD  = -0.23, 95% CI -0.88, 0.42, I² = 91%;  p = 0.49; five

evaluations) where BMI differences were non- significant. Insufficient data (only one 
evaluation) prevented subgroup analyses fo r BMI reduction at 12 months or more. 
Eight internet-based evaluations report ed waist circumference and found greater 
decreases in the internet-based self-direct ed intervention group than those receiving no 
treatment or minimal intervention ( MD = -2.69 cm, CI -5.01, -0.37) ( SMD  = -0.85, 95% CI -
1.40, -0.29, I ² = 96%; p = .003). Additional average loss of waist circumference per 
participant in the intervention group range d from 0.1 to 5.8 cm (Suppl. Figure 12). The 
median follow-up time for this whole-sample an alysis was 4 months. Insufficient data (only 
one evaluation) precluded longe r-term sub-analyses for waist circumference outcomes. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
We omitted Veverka et al. (2003) as its effect si ze was much larger than other evaluations but 
found that this did not change the magnitude or  direction of the overall findings. Funnel plots 
of analyses containing five or  more studies were inspected and these appeared to be 
symmetrical suggesting a small possibility of pu blication bias in studies. Due to the low 
overall quality of the studies included, it was not  possible to perform a sensitivity analysis 
including only high quality studies. 
Change Technique Inclusion and Effectiv eness of Self-Directed Interventions 
It was possible to compare interventions that di d or did not include fi ve of the 12 identified 
change techniques, namely, goal setting, self-mon itoring, provision of feedback, instructions 
to enhance behavioural skills and provision of social support. For each of these techniques, at 
least four studies described interventions that did and di d not include the technique. 
Insufficient data was available for other ch ange techniques. Inte rventions describing 
inclusion of each of these techniques were not f ound to be more effective, in terms of mean 
weight loss, than those that did not report inclusion. Detailed results are presented in 
Supplementary Table 5 and Figure 13–17.

Interventions incl uding goal setting (SMD  = -0.46, 95% CI -0.68, -0.25, I² = 79%; p < 
.0001; 15 evaluations) were not significantly more  effective that those not including goal 
setting ( SMD = -0.31, 95% CI -0.67, 0.04, I² = 75%; p = 0.08; 10 evaluations) ( p = 0.48). 
Interventions includ ing self-monitoring ( SMD  = -0.43, 95% CI -0.63, -0.24, I² = 78%; 
p < .0001; 21 evaluations) were not significantly more effective th at those not including self-
monitoring ( SMD  = -0.22, 95% CI -0.62, 0.18, I² = 66%; p = 0.29; four evaluations) ( p = 
0.35). 
Interventions including feedback resu lted in slightly more weight loss ( SMD  = -0.42, 
95% CI -0.62, -0.21, I² = 79%; p < .0001; 17 evaluations) than those not including feedback 
(SMD  = -0.52, 95% CI -0.89, -0.16, I² = 82%; p = .005; eight evaluations) but this difference 
was not statistically significant ( p = 0.62).  
Interventions including instructions to enhance behavioural skills ( SMD  = -0.48, 95% 
CI -0.71, -0.25, I² = 77%; p < .0001; 16 evaluations) were not significantly more effective 
that those not including instructions  to enhance behavioural skills (SMD  = -0.27, 95% CI -
0.55, 0.01, I² = 76%; p = .06; nine evaluations) ( p = 0.26). 
Finally, interventions including social support resulted in slightly more weight loss 
(SMD  = -0.42, 95% CI -0.68, -0.17, I² = 82%; p = .001; 15 evaluations) than those not 
including social support ( SMD  = -0.36, 95% CI -0.62, -0.10, I² = 72%; p = .006; 10 
evaluations) but this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.74). 
Discussion 
This is the first systematic review of randomised controlled trials of self-directed, interactive, 
weight-loss interventions, i nvolving no professional contact apart from an introductory 
session. Our findings show that these intervention s are, in general, effective in promoting 
weight loss at three and six m
onths follo w-up compared to no treatment, minimal 
interventions or usual care. On average, across interventions, those in self-directed

intervention groups lost an additional 1.56 kg when compared to those in the minimal 
intervention or no treatment groups. Similar resu lts were found for reduced BMI at up to 6 
months compared to the comparison groups. The ma jority of the interventions were delivered 
using the internet and this subset showed very  similar results to the overall study sample with 
additional weight loss per partic ipant in internet-based, self-d irected interventions of 1.72 kg. 
We conclude that self-directed weight-los s interventions, including internet-delivered 
interventions, are effective for s upporting weight loss up to 6 months.  
The average magnitude of observed weight loss just falls short of what is regarded as 
clinically meaningful (approximately 2-3 kg) (Greaves et al., 2011) suggesting that these 
interventions have potential as c linically-relevant sta ndalone services. In addition, since they 
are likely to be cost-effective, when effective,  they may also augment clinic services. They 
can provide 24-hour (on-the-go) access to multiple  self-regulatory weight-loss techniques 
such as self-monitoring, feedback and social support to help w ith weight maintenance. More 
importantly, with only one initial face-to-face professional contact, they can prolong client 
and professional contact engage ment without further professional contact. Only one of the 
trials (McConnon et al., 2007) considered here  included an economic evaluation and they 
found that a self-directed  internet-based intervention cost  £716.28 more per person per year 
compared to usual care. However, they advi sed caution in the interpretation of results 
because of high attrition and low compliance. Further economic evaluations are required to 
assess the value of the observed magnitude of weight loss in rela tion to the cost of providing 
such interventions in community and clinical contexts. 
We did not find evidence of effectiveness of self-directed, weight-loss interventions at 
follow-up of one year or longer but the small numbers of studies av ailable prohibit firm 
conclusions on this question. Wei ght loss is typically regained after 3-5 years in individuals 
who participate in various weight manage ment programmes (Dansinger, Tatsioni, Wong,

Chung, & Balk, 2007; Katan, 2009), so it may be th at different approaches—such as online 
behavioural counselling, weekly  face-to-face or group weight management sessions—are 
needed to ensure weight loss maintenance.   
 Our findings are consistent with those of Hartmann-Boyce et al. (2015) who found 
that an overlapping set of trials of “s elf-help” interventions, some including ongoing 
professional support, were effective at promoting weight loss among overweight and obese users. These authors findings at 6 months follow up ( MD = -1.85 kg, CI -2.86, -0.83 based on 
7 studies) are similar to our 0-4 month follo w up findings (3.1-month follow-up median) for 
self-directed interventions ( MD = -1.65 kg, CI -2.40, -0.89 based on 13 studies including 20 
evaluations). Hartmann-Boyce et al. (2015) repo rted that self-help interventions were not 
effective at 12 months and we also found that self-directed interventi ons did not generate 
sustained weight loss gains beyond 12 months. It is interesting to compare findings for our sub-group of internet-based self-directed interventions ( MD = -1.72 kg, CI -2.60, -0.84; 13 
studies) with those reported by Hutchesson et al. (2015) ( MD= -2.70 kg, CI -3.33, -2.08; 9 
studies) and Wieland et al. (2012) ( MD = -1.5 kg, CI -2.1, -0.9; two studies), which both 
included internet-based interventions involving professional contact. Hutchesson et al. (2015) 
reported greater weight loss (additional 0.98 kg) when compared to a minimum or no 
treatment comparison group whereas Wieland et al. (2012) reported less weight loss, based 
on a meta-analysis including just two studies. Given the broadly similar findings found across 
all four reviews, it is interesting to questi on whether professional contact, which adds to 
costs, is necessary for self-initiated weight loss up to six months and whether effectiveness 
depends on online collaborative sessions between professionals and users. If, as our findings 
suggest, self-directed interventions can gene rate weight loss up to  six months without 
ongoing professional contact this co uld greatly enhance the cost effectiveness of weight loss 
services, including those targeting diabetes prevention.

Our review is the first to identify and asse ss the effects of includi ng particular change 
techniques in self-directed interventions. Unfortunately, however, our categorisation of 
change techniques from interven tion descriptions provided in published papers offers little 
insight into optimal design. We were only able to compare interventions that did or did not 
include five change techniques and found no si gnificant weight-loss differences between 
intervention including and excluding these techniques. We cannot infer that the inclusion of 
these change techniques makes no difference to  effectiveness because  the relatively small 
numbers of intervention compared vary in ma ny other respects. Moreover, our capacity to 
characterise intervention content may have been  limited by the brief descriptions provided in 
the papers we examined, such analyses may be better undertaken usi ng full intervention 
manuals (Abraham & Michie, 2008). It would be  helpful if trials evaluating self-directed 
interventions described their in terventions in more detail (e.g.  in supplementary documents) 
and provided readily available manuals to allo w researchers and commissioners to examine 
content in detail. When more trials are availabl e, further research may clarify whether factors 
other than the inclusion of change techniques are more important in these interventions or 
whether our study was simply not powered to find small but potentially important increments 
in effectiveness that may follow from inclusi on of particular self-re gulatory techniques.  
 This review has both strengths and limitations. It is the first review to focus exclusively on self-direc ted interventions and we found that  most of these were internet-
based. Consequently, our data allows conclusi ons to be drawn about a specific group of 
weight loss interventions. On the other hand, we  had small samples, which may have reduced 
power to identify the effects of intervention co ntent on heterogeneity of  effect sizes and to 
draw conclusions about maintenance of weight loss. Heterogeneity was large across all meta-
analytic calculations even when subgroup an alyses accounted for length of follow-up. This 
wide variation may be the result of severa l factors including dive rse target populations,

intervention content, applied theoretical frameworks, inaccu racy of study descriptions, 
intervention intensity and duration, and study qua lity. It is noteworthy too that while our 
inclusion criteria specified heal thy adults, many of the samples in this review were not, on 
average, overweight or obese, perhaps furthe r limiting the implicati ons of our findings for 
clinical applications of these interventions. 
 Although every effort was made to eliminate bias in the search, selection of studies, 
data extraction, and data analysis, it is possible that we excl uded some relevant studies due to 
inadequate intervention descriptio ns in study abstracts.  It is also important to note that the 
methods employed in many trials here indicated a risk of bias in interpretation. Finally, this 
review emphasise the importance of using objective measures of weight loss and weight 
maintenance at 12 months and beyond.  
 In conclusion, self-directed weight-lo ss interventions that do not involve ongoing 
professional support, including those delivered using the internet, can generate modest 
significant weight loss at up to si x months but, as yet, there is little evidence to suggest that 
they promote weight loss maintenance. Since th ey are likely to be cost effective, when 
effective, they may provide usef ul adjuncts to existing commun ity and clinical services, and 
could potentially be used exclus ively to generate clinically me aningful weight loss. Further, 
high-quality trials are needed to establish the longer-term effects of self-directed interventions in a wider range of formats.
