Abstract
Background: Approximately, half of stroke survivors experience fatigue. Fatigue may persist for many months and
interferes with participation in everyday activities and has a negative impact on social and family relationships,
return to work, and quality of life. Fatigue is among the top 10 priorities for ‘Life after Stroke ’research for stroke
survivors, carers, and clinicians. We previously developed and tested in a small uncontrolled pilot study a
manualised, clinical psychologist-delivered, face-to-face intervention, informed by cognitive behavioural therapy
(CBT). We then adapted it for delivery by trained therapists via telephone. We now aim to test the feasibility of this
approach in a parallel group, randomised controlled feasibility trial ( PostStroke Intervention TrialInFatigue,
POSITIF).
Methods/design: POSITIF aims to recruit 75 stroke survivors between 3 months and 2 years post-stroke who would
like treatment for their fatigue. Eligible consenting stroke survivors will be randomised to either a 7-session
manualised telephone-delivered intervention based on CBT principles plus information about fatigue, or
information only. The aims of the intervention are to (i) provide an explanation for post-stroke fatigue, in particular
that it is potentially reversible (an educational approach), (ii) encourage participants to overcome the fear of taking
physical activity and challenge negative thinking (a cognitive approach) and (iii) promote a balance between daily
activities, rest and sleep and then gradually increase levels of physical activity (a behavioural approach). Fatigue,
mood, quality of life, return to work and putative mediators will be assessed at baseline (just before randomisation),
at the end of treatment and 6 months after randomisation. POSITIF will determine the feasibility of recruitment,
adherence to the intervention and the resources required to deliver the intervention in a larger trial.

Background
Approximately, 130,000 people have a stroke each year
in the UK [ 1,2]. Of these, almost a half will experience
post-stroke fatigue [ 3]. Fatigue can be defined as a sub-
jective feeling of lack of energy, weariness and aversion
to effort [ 4] and in many cases, becomes a chronic
symptom that has an adverse effect on a person ’s ability
to manage everyday activities, socialise and maintain in-
timate relationships and to return to paid employment
[5,6]. The self-reported quality of life of fatigued stroke
survivors is often very low [ 7]. It is therefore not surpris-
ing that the need to find effective treatments for fatigue
was amongst the top 10 priorities for ‘Life after Stroke ’
research shared by stroke survivors, carers, clinicians
and researchers [ 8].
The search for effective treatments for post-stroke fa-
tigue has been challenging. There has been little success
in identifying biological causes. For example, there is no
clear association between fatigue and the severity of
stroke or stroke lesion location [ 9]. Perhaps not surpris-
ingly, biological treatments have so far been shown to be
ineffective at alleviating fatigue in this population [ 10].
Therefore, in order to identify intervention targets in a
broader context of stroke illness, we conducted a sys-
tematic review to explore the correlates of post-stroke
fatigue [ 11]. Drawing on this evidence and our qualita-
tive study of the experiences of individuals with post-
stroke fatigue [ 12], we developed a stroke-specific model
of fatigue, which proposed that depressive symptoms,
anxiety, low self-efficacy, passive coping, reduced phys-
ical activity, sleep problems and inadequate social sup-
port are all important factors in the development and/or
maintenance of fatigue [ 13]. These associations are con-
sistent with findings from a qualitative study in which
patients with post-stroke fatigue reported that rehabilita-
tion and good sleep improved fatigue symptoms [ 12].
Figure 1presents a conceptual model of post-stroke fa-
tigue based on our work.
The psychological, behavioural and environmental fac-
tors outlined above are consistent with cognitive behav-
ioural models for functional neurological symptoms (e.g.
[14]), where these factors are interconnected and may
cause or maintain fatigue symptoms, and our earlier
work treating fatigue in the population [ 14,15] and
cancer-related fatigue [ 16]. The premise of cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT) is that addressing unhelpful
thoughts and behaviours can change how people feel
physically and emotionally [ 17]. We hypothesised [ 13]
that increasing physical activity would be a starting point
to break this ‘vicious cycle ’of post-stroke fatigue, be-
cause increasing activity levels would challenge cognitive
barriers to activity (e.g. ‘This discomfort when I move is
a sign I should take it easy ’). The experience of being
more active would then improve patients ’self-efficacy in
taking physical activity and thus reduce fatigue and im-
prove mood [ 18]. There is an association between post-
stroke fatigue and inactivity [ 19], and, therefore, increas-
ing activity levels after stroke is a key component of the
intervention.
To test these ideas, we created a brief manualised
intervention with input from stroke survivors and stroke
clinicians [ 20]. The intervention aimed firstly to provide
individuals with an explanation of post-stroke fatigue
based on the psychological factors identified following
systematic review of the literature, and to explain that
the impact of post-stroke fatigue is reversible. Secondly,
it encouraged fatigued stroke survivors to overcome any
fears they might have about taking physical activity, spe-
cifically to challenge negative thoughts about their fa-
tigue (e.g. ‘There ’s nothing I can do about this ’), that is
to say a cognitive approach. Thirdly, the intervention
promoted a balance between daily activities, rest and
sleep, aiming for individuals to increase in increments
their level of physical activity using diary monitoring and
activity scheduling, in other words, a behavioural ap-
proach [ 14]. At the development phase, the intervention
was delivered in an uncontrolled pilot study to 12 partic-
ipants with post-stroke fatigue by a clinical psychologist
with a special interest in stroke, to determine prelimin-
ary acceptability and feasibility [ 20]. The intervention
comprised a participant handbook that included forms
for diary keeping, six face-to-face treatment sessions and
one follow-up telephone-delivered review ( ‘booster ’) ses-
sion. Fatigue levels were lower at the end of the study
than at baseline for the eight individuals who completed
treatment, and all participants reported favourable opin-
ions of the intervention [ 20].
Following publication of the findings from this small
observational trial, the trial intervention handbooks were
edited taking into account participant feedback. WeGillespie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:84 Page 2 of 14
added new information about stroke survivors ’experi-
ences of fatigue following a workshop about post-stroke
fatigue at the Stroke Association UK Stroke Assembly (a
conference for stroke survivors) in July 2017. At this
point, a decision was made that for the next stage of
intervention development, the Post Stroke Intervention
Trial InFatigue (POSITIF) would be delivered by trained
nurses or other allied health care professionals (AHPs)
or psychology graduates with training in CBT rather
than clinical psychologists; the latter are too few in num-
ber to deliver this intervention across a national health
care system, but nurses and other AHPs are core mem-
bers of most stroke care teams, and are potentially a
more cost effective option.
For pragmatic reasons, it was decided that the inter-
vention would have a better chance of being accepted
by clinical services if it could be offered to partici-
pants via telephone rather than face-to-face. This is
because stroke services woul d struggle to offer treat-
ments, even ones that are clinically effective, if the re-
sources required to deliver them were too great. Wewere also mindful of the f act that many stroke survi-
vors, particularly those with fatigue, struggle to get to
hospitals and clinics so telephone delivery might offer
a convenient way to receive a psychological
treatment.
A telephone approach is justified as there is evidence
from the literature that telephone-based delivery of CBT
is feasible and effective. For example, a meta-analysis of
8 studies recruiting 658 participants with a range of
physical problems including stroke revealed that tele-
phone counselling, delivered by therapists or psycholo-
gists, resulted in significant improvements in coping
skills and strategies, community integration and reduc-
tion in depression [ 21]. In participants with traumatic
brain injury, seven scheduled telephone sessions over 9
months designed to elicit current concerns, provide in-
formation and facilitate problem solving in domains
relevant to traumatic brain injury recovery that were as-
sociated with lower depression scores compared with
usual care [ 22]. Our previous work in chronic fatigue
syndrome had suggested that telephone treatment was

acceptable to patients in a small randomised controlled
trial [ 23].
The aim of this trial is to assess the feasibility of our
trial methods.
Methods
Study registration
The study design was approved by the East of Scotland
Research Ethics Committee (30 January 2018). The trial
was registered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health
onClinicalTrials.gov (11 June 2018) with trial identifica-
tion NCT03551327. Recruitment commenced in January
2019 and is currently ongoing.
Trial design
The study is a UK-based, multi-site, randomised con-
trolled feasibility trial including participants with post-
stroke fatigue with broad entry criteria and follow-up to
ascertain outcomes at 6 months after randomisation.
The primary aim of the POSITIF feasibility trial is to as-
certain recruitment rates, participant adherence to the
intervention and completeness of data capture during
intervention delivery and at follow-up. At the time of
submission to ClinicalTrials.gov , our intention was to
move seamlessly from a feasibility trial to an efficacy trial
without stopping and analysing data. However, our ap-
plication for further funding was not successful and so a
decision was made to analyse and report data from the
feasibility trial as described in this paper, in line with our
pre-specified criteria for moving to the main phase of
the trial.
The expected flow of participants through the trial is
shown in Fig. 2.
Sample size
The recruitment period is 14 months, and we aim to re-
cruit at least 75 participants in total from three hospital
sites and online self-identification. This number is con-
sistent with recommended sample sizes for pilot rando-
mised controlled trials (RCTs) [ 24], 60 –100 participants
generally being required to estimate event rates in a sin-
gle group. We will monitor recruitment rates closely so
that any issues or barriers to recruitment can be identi-
fied and resolved.
Participants
We aim to recruit participants who meet the eligibility
criteria (see below). A three-pronged approach to re-
cruitment, namely, retrospective, prospective and self-
identification will be used.
For retrospective recruitment, each site will identify
potentially eligible participants by screening stroke regis-
ters, audit databases, patient hospital discharge summar-
ies and The Scottish Health Research Register (SHARE)and through nurses and support workers who see pa-
tients after discharge from hospital. In Scotland, nurses
from the charity Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland
(CHSS) visit most patients after discharge from hospital.
The retrospective approach will be used until the ‘pool ’
of potential participants who have had a stroke within
the previous 2 years has been reached. Individuals iden-
tified as being potentially eligible will be contacted by
letter or in person by a member of the clinical team (in-
cluding, but not limited to, the lead clinician for the ser-
vice, the individual ’s hospital consultant or charge nurse)
with an invitation to participate in the screening process
and the trial if eligible; a participant information sheet
and a consent form will be provided. If no response is
received from the letter of invitation within 2 weeks, the
local team will telephone the individual to ensure that
the information was received and answer any questions
they might have. Screening questionnaires and consent
forms will be completed by participants at home and
returned to the research team by post or by email.
For prospective recruitment, participants will be identi-
fied shortly after their hospital admission for stroke, at
outpatient stroke clinics or soon after discharge from hos-
pital by the stroke nurses who visit patients in the com-
munity (generally three weeks following discharge). The
initial approach to the patient will be in person by a mem-
ber of the clinical team. Consent will be obtained for sub-
sequent screening 3 months after stroke onset and for
participation in the trial if eligible. If a patient is ‘missed ’
whilst in hospital (e.g. due to a very short hospital stay),
then they will be contacted as for the retrospectively re-
cruited participants. If a patient consents but does not re-
turn the screening questionnaires, a telephone call will be
made to find out if they wish to take part.
Finally, individuals will be able to identify themselves
as potential feasibility trial participants from the web
links of the UK ’s two main stroke charities, CHSS ( Self-
help4stroke , a self-management resource for anyone who
has had a stroke, and Stroke4carers , an information and
signposting portal for the carers and families of stroke
survivors) and The Stroke Association ( My Stroke Guide ,
a website providing resources and information to people
affected by stroke). Those who are recruited in this way
will participate in screening as described above.

If a participant scores ≥15 (the threshold for moder-
ately severe depression) or scores 1, 2 or 3 on the sui-
cidal item on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item
(PHQ-9) [ 27], they will be telephoned by a member of
the research team to ascertain the individual ’s level of
risk. We will write to the participant and their General
Practitioner (GP). The GP will be advised of the score
and what this means, and that we suggest further inves-
tigation and treatment. The same procedure —writing to
participant and GP —will take place if a participant
scores ≥15 on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item
(GAD-7) [ 28] (the usual threshold for severe anxiety).
We will not inform participants of their scores but we
will inform them that screening has indicated possible
problems with their mood or anxiety, and that we
strongly encourage them to discuss this with their GP.
Individuals will be excluded only if they are actively
suicidal, requiring in-patient treatment or have
depression-related cognitive impairment or if the
individual has a PTSD syndrome or panic disorder (see
above). In such situations, specific intervention from
psychiatry or psychology would be needed before joining
the POSITIF trial.
Co-enrolment
Inclusion in another resear ch study, including another
randomised controlled trial, will not automatically
exclude an individual from participating in POSITIF.
As long as inclusion in the other study would not
confound the results of POSITIF, co-enrolment will
be permissible.
However, if someone has already been enrolled into a
trial of a psychological therapy, they cannot be enrolled
into POSITIF. If a participant is enrolled into POSITIF
and is still being follow-up, they may not subsequently
be enrolled into a trial of psychological therapy. If an
individual has been recruited to a trial of a physical
activity intervention, we will not allow them to take part
in POSITIF.When considering co-enrolment, we will be mindful of
the potential burden upon participants, their families
and research staff.
Consent to participate
Eligible participants will be given a Patient Information
Sheet (PIS) that explains what is involved in the study
and an Informed Consent Form (ICF). If the potential
participant requires additional information, they can
contact the POSITIF trial team in the Edinburgh Clinical
Trials Unit (ECTU) or the local investigator. We have
developed ‘easy access ’materials (PIS, ICF and partici-
pant handbook) to support the participation of people
with communication difficulties with input from people
with aphasia.
Participants will receive the PIS/ICF differently de-
pending on how they are identified:
(a) Participants who are identified retrospectively will
be sent an ‘invitation pack ’which includes an
invitation cover letter, PIS, ICF and screening form
(b) Participants who are identified prospectively will be
either given the PIS only (if an in-patient and stroke
occurred < 3 months ago) and the ICF and screen-
ing form will be sent later, or they may be given/
sent the invitation pack as described above if the
stroke occurred ≥3 months ago
(c) Participants who self-refer will either give consent
on-line (via a secure webpage) or they will be sent
an invitation pack as described above (the partici-
pant will be able to choose their preference). Partic-
ipants who consent on-line will be sent a paper
copy of the PIS for their records.
Screening
There will be 6 screening items:
a) Two simple screening questions for fatigue [ 25]:
(participants must answer ‘yes ’to both to be
eligible): ‘Do you feel tired all the time or get tired
very quickly since your stroke?; ‘Would you like
additional help and support for this? ’
b) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ 9) [ 27]. The
scores range from 0 –27, with a higher score repre-
senting more severe depression (0 –4 none, 5 –9
mild, 10 –14 moderate, 15 –19 moderately severe,
20–27 severe)
c) Generalised anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) [ 28]. The
score ranges from 0 –21 with a higher score
representing more severe anxiety (5, 10 and 15 are
the thresholds for mild, moderate and severe
anxiety, respectively)Gillespie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:84 Page 6 of 14
d) ‘In the past week, how difficult was it for you to
think quickly? ’(cognitive item from the Short
Stroke Impact Scale, SF-SIS) [ 26]
e) ‘In the past week, how difficult was it to understand
what was being said to you in a conversation? ’
(language item from the SF-SIS) [ 26]
f) Besides your stroke, do you have any other serious
or life-threatening illnesses?
In addition to the screening items outlined above, in-
formation on stroke subtype will be obtained. We will
assess this by asking the question ‘Was your stroke due
to a bleed or a blood clot? ’We did consider extracting
information about stroke type from all participants ’
medical case notes, but whilst this would be possible for
participants identified by local recruitment sites, it would
not be so easy to obtain this information for participants
who self-identify for the study. In this feasibility trial, we
will assess the agreement between participant report and
case note diagnosis for participants recruited locally.
This will enable us to estimate the extent of incorrect
classification. We will also collect self-reported Modified
Rankin Score (simple question version) [ 29] to obtain in-
formation on level of dependence, and we will ask indi-
viduals to list their medications and then answer the
following question ‘Do you suffer from any of the follow-
ing illnesses: cancer, heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis,
Parkinson ’s disease, multiple sclerosis? ’because all of
these illnesses can cause fatigue [ 14,15].
Those eligible will be asked to complete baseline data
and will be randomised through the trial database. If the
participant completes the screening questionnaires, and
is found to be eligible for randomisation, they will be
sent a baseline data collection form for completion (ei-
ther by email or by post), and will then be randomised.
We anticipate that some participants may change their
mind after being found to be eligible to participate. If we
do not receive the baseline data, the participant will be
telephoned. If the baseline data are not returned even
after a telephone call, we will categorise the participant
as having consented and been found to be eligible, but
not randomised.
Withdrawal of study participants
Participants may consent, be eligible and then change
their minds at a later time. The participant ’s doctor may
advise them to stop participating in the intervention. We
will record how often each of these scenarios occur. We
will still follow-up the participant per protocol and col-
lect 6 months follow-up data for the primary analyses.
However, if a participant chooses to withdraw com-
pletely from the trial and not participate in follow-up,
we will retain the data collected on that participant up
to that point.If a participant loses capacity during the trial, no fur-
ther follow-up will be obtained but we will retain data
already collected.
This intervention is low risk, and we do not anticipate
major problems. However, should a participant develop
any contraindication to participation during the inter-
vention, for example due to severe deterioration in men-
tal state, they will stop participating in the intervention
but will continue to be followed up. If the contraindica-
tion resolves within 4 weeks, the participant will be
allowed to restart the intervention and complete the six
sessions and the booster phone call.
Randomisation
Each participant ’s screening and baseline data will be en-
tered into a computerised central randomisation service
by means of a secure 24/7 web interface. After the com-
puter program has checked data for completeness and
consistency, it will allocate the participant a unique
study identification number and assign them to either
the intervention or the control arm of the study. The
system applies a minimisation program to achieve bal-
ance for three factors, namely, (i) time since stroke (as
fatigue tends to improve over time; < 1 year versus ≥1
year) [ 3], (ii) sex (since fatigue tends to be more com-
mon in women) [ 30] and (iii) depression score at base-
line (since those with more depressive symptoms may
have more severe fatigue and so respond differently to
the intervention) [ 11]. Minimisation on anxiety and fa-
tigue will not be required because depression, anxiety
and fatigue tend to be highly correlated [ 11].
The randomisation record will be stored within the
trial database. Following randomisation to either the
intervention or control arm, a letter will be sent to the
participant ’s GP to inform them of their patient ’s enrol-
ment in the trial with a copy of the signed participant
consent form. The participant will be informed by tele-
phone, email or post about the randomisation outcome.
The intervention will commence within 2 weeks of ran-
domisation, depending on the availability of therapist
and participant.
Intervention
This is a pragmatic trial. As stroke psychologists are
scarce in the United Kingdom National Health Service
(NHS) [ 31], it was decided that nurses or AHPs would
be trained to deliver the intervention. The nurse/AHP
therapists will receive standardised training from an ex-
perienced stroke clinical psychologist (DG) and fatigue
expert and cognitive behavioural psychotherapist (TC)
in how to deliver the intervention, and how to record
the content of each session using a checklist. The 1-day
training will comprise an overview of the literature on
post-stroke fatigue as well as an introduction to theGillespie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:84 Page 7 of 14
principles and practice of CBT, including role play and
group discussion; reading materials for self-study will be
also provided.
The delivery of the intervention will be by telephone.
Trial materials (including written information about fa-
tigue, a participant handbook, participant diary and
follow-up questionnaires) have been made available on a
trial website ( www.ed.ac.uk/usher/edinburgh-clinical-tri-
als/our-studies/all-current-studies/positif/the-positif-
trial).
The intervention will be tailored towards the specific
needs of participants, including their existing activity
levels. For example, after the first session, the participant
completes diaries to record activity and sleep. Then,
based on those diaries, goals related to increasing activity
and improving sleep are negotiated. The content of goals
will be individualised and inevitably vary between partic-
ipants. The participant handbook includes information
sheets about how pain, medication and other medical
conditions may be related to fatigue; participants will be
sign-posted to the particular information relevant to
them.
The intervention comprises six sessions, each sepa-
rated by 2 weeks. In the intervals between sessions, it is
suggested that participants work on their chosen goals.At the final session, participants reflect on any gains
made, how they were achieved, discuss potential set-
backs and make a plan to maintain and/or build on any
behavioural changes they have made which may be influ-
encing levels of fatigue. There is a review phone call two
to four weeks after the sixth session, to check on pro-
gress and to offer ongoing encouragement. An outline of
the content and main focus of each session is provided
in Table 1.
All sessions will be audio recorded on encrypted voice
dictation devices. Nurse/AHP therapists will receive fort-
nightly telephone supervision for the duration of the
study (approximately 30 min per fortnight); the supervis-
ing psychologist (DG) will have the opportunity to listen
to audio recordings before supervision sessions. Table 2
provides an overview of the rationale for the study, as
well as study materials and procedures.
Comparator
Careful consideration was given to the nature of the
control intervention. As there is no effective intervention
for post-stroke fatigue that is routinely available in clin-
ical practice, it is not possible to compare the active
intervention in POSITIF with another active interven-
tion. A ‘placebo ’control intervention such as relaxation

was considered, but would have required considerable
additional resources to administer, and may have been
less acceptable to participants [ 32]. A wait list design
was also considered in which no intervention would be
provided during the experimental treatment period, with
active treatment offered after the final follow-up assess-
ment, but this would also have needed additional re-
sources. The participant handbook could have been
provided to control participants at the end of the post-treatment assessment, but it was designed to be used
with therapist input and could not be easily used by in-
dividuals without support and guidance. Finally, the con-
trol could have been ‘usual care ’, but there were
concerns that participants might decline the invitation
to participate if there was a 50% probability of receiving
nothing additional to routine care. Therefore, it was de-
cided to provide control participants with information
about fatigue. Although information about post-strokeTable 2 Overview of intervention rationale, materials and procedures
Brief name of intervention PostStroke Intervention TrialInFatigue (The POSITIF Trial)
Why (rationale for treatment) Post-stroke fatigue is common, experienced by approximately half of all stroke survivors. It has a
negative impact on a range of important life domains. A systematic review of the literature found
that psychological factors, namely, depression, anxiety, low self-efficacy, passive coping, reduced
physical activity, sleep problems and low levels of social support are implicated in the develop-
ment or maintenance of fatigue following stroke. This evidence suggests that cognitive behav-
ioural treatment methods, which target individuals ’thoughts, behaviours and feelings, and have
been used to treat fatigue in other health conditions, could be effective in the treatment of post-
stroke fatigue.
What (materials) POSITIF is a manualised cognitive behaviourally informed treatment that targets the factors that
have been associated with post-stroke fatigue in the literature. Individuals will receive a participant
manual that includes written information about post-stroke fatigue, as well as activity and sleep
diaries and worksheets for goal setting and thought challenging. Before POSITIF, the materials
were provided to 12 stroke survivors in a small uncontrolled pilot study and edited to take account
of participant and clinician feedback (see Table 1).
What (procedures) Information will be provided to participants about post-stroke fatigue and individuals will be given
an opportunity to discuss their ‘model ’of fatigue, i.e. why they believe they experience it. Any mis-
conceptions about fatigue will be corrected. Activity diaries and sleep diaries will be completed by
participants throughout the intervention and sent to the therapist (by post); these will form the
basis for a tailored approach designed to promote a balance between daily activities, rest and
sleep, the aims being to gradually increase levels of physical activity, and to avoid ‘boom and bust ’
activity patterns. Therapists will identify participant beliefs about fatigue and help participants to
challenge negative thinking, encouraging them overcome any fears about undertaking physical ac-
tivity (see Table 1). The comparator group will receive written information about fatigue only, in
the form of a leaflet (available at www.strokeassociation/dudfuhfud.com ).
Who (profession, expertise, specific training,
etc)The intervention is to be delivered by nurses or Allied Health Professionals (AHPs). These therapists
will be individuals with clinical experience of stroke, but no prior training in Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy (CBT). They will be representative of the nurses who work with stroke survivors in
community stroke settings. Therapists will receive a one-day training that comprises an overview
of the literature on post-stroke fatigue, an introduction to the principles and practice of CBT, and
information on how to deliver the intervention, including how to record the content of sessions. A
stroke clinical psychologist and a cognitive behavioural psychotherapist will deliver the training.
Brief role plays and group discussions will be included; reading materials, including journal articles
will be provided to trial therapists for self-study. Nurse/AHP therapists will receive fortnightly tele-
phone supervision (30-minutes duration) from the stroke clinical psychologist who delivers the
training.
How (modes of delivery) POSITIF sessions will be telephone-delivered. Phone calls will be made at times convenient to par-
ticipants. Therapists will try to call participants at least two or three times before a session is
classed as ‘missed ’, as would happen in clinical practice. Participants will be required to have their
written manuals in front of them during the calls so that therapists can direct them to particular
worksheets and other materials.
Where (infrastructure and relevant features) Participants will receive the telephone sessions in their own homes. They will receive the
participant manuals by post.
When and how much (number of sessions,
duration, intensity, dose)The intervention comprises six sessions, one every two weeks. Sessions will be up to 60 minutes in
duration. In the intervals between sessions, participants will work on their chosen goals. A review
‘booster ’telephone session will take place two to four weeks after the sixth session.
Tailoring (personalisation) Goals will be individualised for each patient to take account of their baseline level of activity and
sleep patterns, their physical health, levels of fatigue and their interests and aspirations.
Modifications (from existing or initial
protocol)Any modifications that are required in the course of the intervention will be recorded.
How well (planned adherence) Adherence to the intervention will be determined as number of sessions each participant receives.Gillespie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:84 Page 9 of 14
fatigue is easily available (e.g. from charity websites), our
clinical experience is that patients are not usually sign-
posted to it. A Cochrane review of information provision
after stroke reported that information alone has a very
small, probably not clinically significant effect on depres-
sion, though there are no data on the effect of informa-
tion provision on fatigue [ 33]. A copy of the information
leaflet, given immediately following randomisation, can
be found at https://www.stroke.org.uk/sites/default/files/

Feasibility outcomes
The following data will help to inform the design of a fu-
ture main efficacy trial:
Recruitment
–The feasibility of individuals referring themselves for
fatigue screening via links to patient websites
including CHSS and The Stroke Association
(number and rate)
–The feasibility of identifying stroke survivors
through local sites (number and rate) and the
proportion who agree to fatigue screening
–The number of stroke survivors who complete the
screening questions, according to the method by
which they were identified (by local sites or self-
identification)
–The proportion of individuals who undergo fatigue
screening who are eligible to participate
–The proportion of eligible patients who are
randomised
–The recruitment rates by different methods and by
different sites
–The feasibility of identifying and training nurses and
AHPs to deliver the intervention
Adherence and retention
–The adherence rate and reasons for non-adherence
(number of sessions participants receive)
–The fidelity of the intervention (i.e. therapist
adherence to the manual)
Data completion and data variability
–The response and completion rates for postal and
web-based questionnaires, and the proportion of
participants requiring telephone calls to collect
follow-up questionnaires
–Variability in our fatigue outcome measureResources
–The resources required to deliver the intervention
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be estab-
lished, and a DMC charter will be written. In this feasi-
bility trial, the Trial Management Group (the
investigators) will provide oversight of the trial and will
function as a Trial Steering Committee (TSC).
Progression criteria
We will proceed to an efficacy trial if the following cri-
teria are achieved in the feasibility trial:
a) Recruit 75 participants in 1 year (from local sites
and through self-referral, e.g. links with relevant
websites)
b) Follow-up (primary outcome in at least 90% of
participants)
c) Adherence to therapy: at least four of the six
sessions attended
If these criteria are not met, the TMG will explore the
reasons for this and may still proceed with an efficacy
trial if the reasons are addressable, for example sick
leave amongst therapists delivering the intervention.
Potential future outcome measures for an efficacy trial
The following measures are not outcomes for this feasi-
bility trial, but are potential measures for a future effi-
cacy trial:
–The Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS). The FAS is a
10-item self-report scale that is valid and reliable in
stroke [ 34]. The scale measures mental and physical
fatigue. A difference of four points is considered to
represent a clinically relevant change on this scale
[35].
–Self-reported mood assessed using PHQ-9 [ 27] and
the GAD-7 [ 28]. We will enquire whether antide-
pressants or anxiolytics have been prescribed
–Self-reported fearful beliefs in relation to exercise, to
determine if these are a mediator in the effect of
CBT on post-stroke fatigue, measured using the fear
avoidance questions from the Cognitive and Behav-
ioural Responses Questionnaire (CBRQ) [ 36]. The
decision to include the CBRQ was made after the
trial was registered with the National Institutes of
Health, as an amendment to our protocol
–Stroke specific quality of life including participant-
reported social participation assessed using the Short
Form of the Stroke Impact Scale (SF-SIS) [ 26]
–Quality of life adjusted life years (QALYs) assessed
using the Euroqol 5D (5-level version) [ 37].Gillespie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:84 Page 10 of 14
–The number of hours participants are working
relative to before their stroke (participants asked to
report average hours worked per week currently and
immediately before stroke).
–We will collect data on health costs (visits to the
GP, number of admissions to hospital, days in a care
home, number of visits from social carers, cost of
the therapist delivery time, cost of the supervision
time from psychology/psychiatry). In a future
efficacy trial, this would enable us to perform a
health economic analysis which will tell us howmuch the intervention costs, whether there are
savings in use of health/social care and what QALYs
are associated with the intervention.
Statistical analysis
We will report numbers and percentages for the tests of
feasibility, without formal statistical testing.
For the proposed outcome measures for a future effi-
cacy trial, in this feasibility study, we will present overall
summaries across both treatment groups combined,
such as mean and standard deviation, number andTable 3 Summary of study assessments and treatment telephone calls

Discussion
A high proportion of stroke survivors experiences fa-
tigue. Post-stroke fatigue is negatively associated with
physical, psychological and social functioning —particu-
larly for those unfortunate enough to experience fatigue
long term —and there is little existing evidence from
RCTs of effective treatments. However, absence of evi-
dence is not the same as evidence of absence; psycho-
logical/behavioural treatments for post-stroke fatigue
have simply not yet been put to rigorous scientific test.
To address this gap, the feasibility stage of POSITIF
aims to test the feasibility of a nurse/AHP provided
telephone-delivered CBT-informed intervention for indi-
viduals who experience fatigue 3 months to 2 years fol-
lowing stroke. We have preliminary data from a
previous pilot study that indicates that the content and
style of the intervention is acceptable. Small improve-
ments have been made to the intervention protocol in
the light of participant and therapist pilot study feed-
back. The main changes from the published uncon-
trolled pilot study have been to move from face-to-face
to telephone delivery of the intervention and to have
nurses and AHPs rather than clinical psychologists de-
liver the intervention. These changes were made on clin-
ical and pragmatic grounds. As far as mode of therapy
delivery is concerned, there is published evidence for the
efficacy of telephone-delivered CBT interventions in
clinical health populations, including participants with
neurological injury [ 21,22] and chronic fatigue syn-
drome [ 23], though we do acknowledge that delivery by
telephone may be less acceptable to individuals with
communication impairment. Delivery of the intervention
by nurses and AHPs rather than clinical psychologists is
a more realistic proposition for health care systems such
as the UK where clinical psychologists are in relatively
short supply [ 31]. Therapists working in multidisciplin-
ary IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies)
teams could also deliver the intervention [ 38].
The intervention may have several advantages over
traditional face-to-face delivered CBT. Because the inter-
vention is delivered by telephone, participants will be
spared the expense of time and effort to travel to clinic
appointments. It is especially important to consider the
demands made on fatigued individuals in interventions
of this type, because potential participants might be re-
luctant to commit scarce energy reserves to such in-
terventions; as noted in a recent Cochrane review,fatigue trials often have high dropout rates [ 10].
Though the intervention is manualised, there is scope
within it to negotiate goals with each participant. In-
deed, the emphasis is on empowering the individual
at all stages of the intervention. It is hoped that this
will enable individuals to make gains beyond the
period of active treatment. The aim that participants
become, in effect, their own therapists lies at the
heart of CBT [ 17].
Improvements in fatigue are not the only outcome of
interest. As well as mood outcomes (depression and anx-
iety), we will record individuals ’social participation, how
likely they are to return to paid work and their overall
quality of life. These are important outcomes, because
one would hope that if the intervention delivered in the
POSITIF trial improves functioning via activity schedul-
ing, then participants ’level of fatigue will also improve.
The importance of improvement in key life roles is well
recognised by so-called ‘third wave ’cognitive behav-
ioural therapies [ 39,40] which help people connect with
personal values and do what matters to them. We also
expect that treatment effects may be mediated by
changes in fearful beliefs. Mechanisms of change will be
assessed in a future trial.
There are limitations and possible challenges. One is
the possibility of loss to follow-up, particularly the attri-
tion bias that would occur if the most fatigued partici-
pants dropped out of the study. Although the
intervention is relatively brief (10 weeks duration, ex-
cluding the booster session), as with all cognitive behav-
ioural therapies, it demands active involvement on the
part of the participant, and home-based practice is ex-
pected following every treatment session. The key, we
believe, is to make sure participants who sign up to the
feasibility trial genuinely do want help to manage their
fatigue and understand what is expected of them (with-
out being off putting). Participant information sheets will
make clear the active nature of the intervention. We will
also perform a sensitivity analysis to compare the char-
acteristics of individuals who complete the intervention
with individuals who do not. We acknowledge that a
limitation of this feasibility study is that intervention and
control conditions are not matched for contact time,
which may have a positive behavioural effect in itself.
However, it would have been impractical within the con-
straints of funding to perform a three arm feasibility
trial. A larger efficacy trial might match participants in
intervention and control arms for therapist contact time,
perhaps comparing individuals receiving POSITIF with
individuals receiving an equivalent amount of non-
directive discussion about the general impact of stroke
on everyday life, such as the unstructured social contact
delivered as the control arm in a trial of communication
therapy for aphasia and dysarthria following stroke [ 41].Gillespie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:84 Page 12 of 14
Fatigue is a serious complication of stroke, blighting
the lives of the large number of individuals who experi-
ence it. The findings will determine whether a rando-
mised trial involving larger numbers of participants with
adequate statistical power is feasible and warranted.
