Abstract
Background: The Healthy Lifestyle Program for women (HeLP-her) is a low-intensity, self-management program
which has demonstrated efficacy in preventing excess weight gain in women. However, little is known about the
implementation, reach, and sustainability of low-intensity prevention programs in rural settings, where risk for
obesity in women is higher than urban settings. We aimed to evaluate a low-intensity healthy lifestyle program
delivered to women in a rural setting to inform development of effective community prevention programs.
Methods: A mixed method hybrid implementation and evaluation study, guided by the RE-AIM framework
(addressing the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance), was undertaken. Data collection
tools included anthropometric measures, program checklists, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews with
participants and local stakeholders. The RE-AIM self-audit tool was applied to assess evaluation rigor.
Results: Six hundred and forty-nine women from 41 relatively socio-economic disadvantaged communities in
Australia participated: mean age 39.6 years (±SD 6.7) and body mass index of 28.8 kg/m2(±SD 6.9). A between-
group weight difference of −0.92 kg (95% CI −1.67 to −0.16) showed program effectiveness. Reach was broad
across 41 towns with 62% of participants reporting influencing some of the health behaviors of their families.
Strong implementation fidelity was achieved with good retention rates at 1 year (76%) and high participant
satisfaction (82% of participants willing to recommend this program). Over 300 multi-level community partnerships
were established supporting high adoption. Stakeholders reported potential capacity to implement and sustain the
prevention program in resource poor rural settings, due to the low-intensity design and minimal resources
required.
Conclusions: Our comprehensive RE-AIM evaluation demonstrates that an evidence-based obesity prevention
program can be successfully implemented in real-world settings. The program achieved broad reach, effectiveness,
and satisfaction at the community and stakeholder level, revealing potential for program sustainability. The
evaluation addressed implementation knowledge gaps to support future obesity prevention program scale-up.

Background
Treatment of established obesity via lifestyle interven-
tions is challenging with poor engagement, high costs,
and minimal sustainability [1, 2]. Weight loss is difficult
to achieve at the individual level due to adaptive physio-
logical responses post-weight loss, which almost univer-
sally drives weight regain [2, 3]. At the individual level,
weight gain prevention is feasible, requiring only minor
modifications to energy intake and expenditure [4]. At
the system level, primary prevention programs have the
potential to reduce health care costs [1, 5]. In this con-
text and with alarming escalation in obesity rates inter-
nationally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
identified prevention of excess weight gain as an inter-
national health priority [6].
Government prevention agencies have advocated the
need for weight gain prevention programs in high-risk
populations. Women have high rates of unhealthy
weight gain [7, 8], and in many world regions, women
have greater obesity prevalence than men [9] with higher
subsequent obesity-related complications [10, 11]. Lon-
gitudinal data reveals that 20% of reproductive-aged
women within a healthy weight range will become over-
weight within 5 years [12]. For most individuals, weight
gain is gradual over several decades and estimated at
600–800 g per year [4]. Notably, even slight increases in
weight of ~0.6 kg per year have been shown to increase
the risk of breast cancer [13], hypertension [14], type 2
diabetes [15], and coronary heart disease [16] in women.
Furthermore, as reproductive-aged women often have a
key role in determining household food choices and sed-
entary behaviors, the need to invest in strategies to pre-
vent excess weight gain in women is clear. In this
context, we developed a low-intensity healthy lifestyle
program for women, The Healthy Lifestyle Program for
women (HeLP-her), shown to have efficacy for prevent-
ing weight gain in women in prior RCT ’s in different set-
tings and ethnically diverse populations [4, 17 –19].
In developed countries, rural-dwelling women are
more vulnerable than urban-dwelling women with lower
socio-economic status and elevated rates of weight gain
and obesity [20, 21]. Additional challenges include re-
duced access to primary health care services, resources,
and trained health professionals [22]. However, few
healthy lifestyle programs have been implemented in
rural settings [5, 23], and a systemic review has
highlighted that the value of weight gain prevention pro-
grams in rural communities has not been established [1].
As such, low-cost, low-intensity weight gain prevention
programs are urgently needed in rural settings [20, 21].
Evaluation provides vital insights into how a program
achieves efficacy and effectiveness. It also generates es-
sential knowledge to drive implementation and scale-up
[24–27] and deliver impact from research investment atthe population level [28 –32]. Despite this, few evalua-
tions have been applied to weight gain prevention pro-
grams, leaving a major knowledge gap [24, 33, 34].
Common barriers to evaluation are lack of funding, time
constraints, limited workforce knowledge, skills, and fa-
miliarity with evaluation methodologies and the dearth
of valid evaluation tools [35].
The RE-AIM evaluation framework (Reach, Effective-
ness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) ex-
plores program implementation and generalizability,
focusing on the transferability of research findings into
clinical practice and policy. The RE-AIM framework was
developed specifically to evaluate health promotion in-
terventions and encourages data collection at both the
individual and organizational level [36, 37]. The RE-AIM
framework has been applied numerous times to health
promotion programs and to childhood obesity preven-
tion programs [38, 39], highlighting its value and meth-
odological rigor. However, on assessment of health
promotion research programs and grants employing the
RE-AIM framework, less than 10% had applied the
complete RE-AIM reporting criteria [40, 41]. Most mea-
sured one or two RE-AIM dimensions only. The authors
of the RE-AIM framework have recently developed cri-
teria to assess the use of the RE-AIM framework [40].
The Healthy Lifestyle Program (HeLP-her) is an
evidence-based weight gain prevention program for
reproductive-aged women, which here was adapted for
rural settings in the HeLP-her Rural trial, with an em-
bedded hybrid implementation and evaluation design
[42]. This manuscript aims to (a) provide a summation
of evaluation and implementation results from the large-
scale HeLP-her Rural randomized controlled trial, utiliz-
ing the RE-AIM framework and (b) assess the applica-
tion of the RE-AIM framework to the HeLP-her Rural
program (utilizing the RE-AIM assessment criteria) [40],
ultimately aiming to inform implementation and scale-
up of obesity prevention programs broadly.
Methods
Program design, setting, theory, and implementation
The efficacy of the HeLP-her program has been estab-
lished previously in two large RCT ’s in a community set-
ting for urban-dwelling women and in an antenatal
clinic setting for pregnant women [4, 17]. Here, we have
used an integrated community cluster RCT design to
adapt and implement the HeLP-her program in relatively
disadvantaged rural communities in the state of Victoria,
Australia (HeLP-her Rural). As previously described,
rural town selection was based on population size
(2000 –10,000 people) and distance from Melbourne cen-
tral business district (CBD; towns located 100 –400 km
from CBD). Study randomization occurred at the town
(cluster) level and analysis at the individual level. Overall,Kozica et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:151 Page 2 of 13
41 rural townships met these criteria and were randomized
to intervention or control towns. Randomization was con-
ducted by the study biostatistician using a computer-
generated randomization list. The primary outcome of
HeLP-her Rural was the diffe rence in weight gain between
control and intervention grou ps at 12 months. Study meth-
odology is published elsewhere [42].
The HeLP-her Rural program
In summary, the program involved a 1-year active inter-
vention followed by a 1-year observation phase (yet to
report). Control participants received a single general
group health information session. The intervention
aimed to improve participant ’s self-management capacity
through skill development including goal setting, prob-
lem solving, and relapse prevention underpinned by the
self-determination theory [43] and motivational inter-
viewing [44]. Participants received the program via
mixed delivery modes with minimal personal contact
(one group session) and lifestyle advice delivered re-
motely (phone coaching, text messages, a program man-
ual, and a website) (see Table 1 for further details). The
study and embedded implementation-evaluation pro-
gram were approved by the Monash Health Research
Ethics Committee for research involving humans, and all
participants provided written informed consent, project
No. 12034B. Written consent was provided by all
participants.
Program evaluation design and theory
This manuscript reports on the results of the embed-
d e dp r o g r a me v a l u a t i o nu s i n ga ne f f e c t i v e n e s s -
implementation hybrid study design and involved the
simultaneous testing of clinical outcomes and imple-
mentation strategies. This research design is thought to
facilitate “more rapid translational gains, more effective
implementation strategies and promote the collection of
useful information for decision makers for scale-up ”[45].
This study design is most appropriate for use when effect-
iveness of the program of interest has been established
previously; such is the case for the HeLP-her program.
The HeLP-her Rural evaluation aimed to explore program
implementation strategies in general within complex sys-
tems, assessing implementation rigor. Within this evalu-
ation, process evaluation measures included program
fidelity, recruitment strategies, dose of the program deliv-
ered and received, program acceptability, and contextual
factors influencing program implementation. A summa-
tive evaluation investigated overall program effectiveness,
quality, community outcomes, and potential for future
scale-up. Results on program effectiveness (weight
changes), implementation (dose delivered and received, fi-
delity, recruitment, and program context) and the poten-
tial for program sustainability at the organization levelhave been previously published [46 –50]. However, these
results are also summarized here to address all elements
of the RE-AIM framework.
Program recruitment and implementation
Recruitment occurred from September 2012 –April 2013
(Fig. 1) [49]. Participant recruitment strategies were
underpinned by a comprehensive communication and
engagement plan and were deliberately simple and lowTable 1 HeLP-her Rural implementation and delivery
Community engagement
Regional government departments and community and school
leaders were contacted by email, and a follow-up phone call was made.
They were invited to support the program implementation by providing
introductions to key community groups and assistance with recruitment
and providing facilities for program delivery.
Program setting and facilitation
The program was facilitated by three tertiary qualified health
professionals with expertise in nutrition, physical activity, and evidence-
based practice, and all had worked within the Australian health sector
previously. Program facilitators underwent a 1-day training day, led by
the program leader, which covered the HeLP-her program theory and
practical component, as well as provided motivational interviewing
techniques.
Program theory and delivery
The program was designed to be low intensity and focused on
participants making small long-term sustainable behavior changes. In
this program, 41 rural communities were randomized to intervention or
control groups. The control participants attended a single general group
health information session. The intervention participants received lifestyle
advice through mixed delivery modes including (i) limited personal
contact: one group session and (ii) remotely, consisting of one
phone coaching session, monthly text message reminders, and a
program manual. The delivery methods were designed to reinforce
program messages, appeal to various learning styles, and minimize
program costs.
Group session
One 60-min group session was held with 8 –15 women at community
locations such as schools or halls. Facilitators delivered general
health information plus simple health messages. Facilitators using an
interactive model and supported by the program manual worked
through examples of behavioral self-management skills including setting
health priorities, problem solving, and self-monitoring, focusing on small
changes to behavior.
Program manual
The manual included simple information to improve knowledge and
included activities to develop self-management skills such as problem
solving, goal setting, and action planning. The participants completed
the activities during the interactive group session and were then requested
to work through manual activities in their own time.
Phone coaching
Each participant was provided a single 20-min phone coaching
session at 16 weeks post intervention commencement. The phone
coaching session was delivered by trained coaches to assist completion of
manual activities and reinforce program health messages.
SMS text messages and support
One text message was sent every 4 weeks in line with program
messages, to remind the participants of the key program messages and
goals.Kozica et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:151 Page 3 of 13
cost to reflect community practice. To assist implemen-
tation, we focused on community integration within
existing structures and engaged rural communities at
multiple levels including local government departments,
health services, primary schools, kindergartens, and
community groups. Participants were recruited through
the distribution of an invitation letter and flyer to
women, and research staff visited each township to pro-
vide information in person to potential participants. All
women aged 18 –55 living in the 41 selected communi-
ties were invited by letter and community flyers to par-
ticipate in this program. Program recruitment strategies
are described elsewhere [50] (Table 1).
Data collection methods
The HeLP-her Rural evaluation used mixed method data
collection design (Additional file 1) [47]. These included
the following: (1) sourcing and analyzing administration
data, (2) checklists and log books completed by program
leaders, (3) observations by research team, (4) anthropo-
metric data, (5) questionnaires completed by partici-
pants, (6a) semi-structured interviews with a sub-group
of participants, (6b) semi-structured interviews with
rural stakeholders, and (7) an evaluation self-audit.1) Administrative data and contextual data
To explore program reach and context, data from
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) measuring
Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) of relative
disadvantage was utilized [ 51]. Potential scores ranged
from 1 to 10 with a lower score indicating a greater
level of social disadvantage relating to household total
income, education attained, and unemployment rates.
2) Program checklists and log books
Program specific process evaluation checklists were
developed in conjunction with the research team
field notes to assess implementation fidelity,
recruitment, dose delivered, and program context.
Program log books were kept to monitor program
communication with organizational program
partners.
3) Observations by the research team
The intervention was delivered by a research team
(dieticians and exercise physiologists), working in
pairs, with one researcher delivering the
intervention, the other observing implementation,
collecting data, completing checklists and offering
feedback to ensure delivery consistency. Program
fidelity was addressed by all researchers undergoing

a 1-day training workshop (August 2012) delivered
by an experienced trainer (CB) and receiving ongoing
support and utilizing program developed presenta-
tions and resources, promoting consistency of
program delivery (Table 1).
4) Anthropometric data
Weight, height, and waist and hip circumference
measurements were collected by the trained team at
baseline, 12 months (end of active intervention), and
24 months (end of observation).
5) Questionnaires completed by participants
All participants completed program devised
questionnaires at baseline (prior to intervention
commencement) and 12 and 24 months including
items on demographic characteristics, socio-cultural
and physical environment, health status, and pro-
gram satisfaction. Participant program satisfaction
(overall program, information provided, program
delivery, and support provided) was assessed on a
program-devised Likert scale (1 –5) with higher
scores representing greater satisfaction.
6) Semi-structured (qualitative) participant and
stakeholder interviews
In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted
with a sub-group of participant ’s 6 months post
intervention commencement. A criteria-based, con-
venience sampling approach as previously described
[47,48] involved women from ten communities (six
intervention and four control). One trained re-
searcher conducted all interviews (SK), guided by an
interview schedule (Additional file 2). Forty-five par-
ticipant interviews were conducted until data satur-
ation was met, determined when no new ideas
emerged from the interviews, as per standard
methods [ 52].
Local stakeholders were identified as those who had
a direct interest in the development, delivery, and
outcomes of prevention programs and included local
government employees, clinical health care providers
(general practitioners, allied health, community
nurses), and non-clinical health providers as previ-
ously described [ 46]. These stakeholders had not dir-
ectly implemented the HeLP-her Rural program,
rather enabled access to local networks for the re-
search team during program implementation. Stake-
holders were asked to provide insight into the
enablers, barriers, and strategies that would promote
program implementation for weight gain prevention.
Prior to interviews, each stakeholder was provided
with an overview of the HeLP-her study background,
the design, staffing, intensity, and implementation
plan. Twenty-four semi-structured telephone inter-
views were conducted led by one researcher (SK)
(Additional file 3).7) Evaluation self-audit (meta-evaluation) of the HeLP-
her Rural program
A meta-evaluation refers to the auditing and assess-
ment of a program evaluation, determining if the
evaluation has produced credible and justifiable con-
clusions [ 53]. We applied a criteria-based tool to as-
sess the application of the RE-AIM framework to
the HeLP-her Rural evaluation, developed by Kessler
et al. [ 40]. This tool outlines a minimum set of
“core ”items ( n= 31) producing total and item-
specific scores for each of the five RE-AIM domains.
This corresponds to a comprehensive application of
the framework, termed “fully developed use of RE-
AIM ”. Items that are not applicable to the program
were excluded from the total calculated score
(Table 2)[40].
Data analysis
The statistical analysis plan has been previously reported
as has statistical methods applied [42, 49]. Data analysis
was conducted using STATA and SPSS version 19.0 for
Windows. The trial was designed to have a statistical
power of 80% to detect a difference of 1.0 kg in weight
between groups at 1-year with the use of a two-sided
test at a significance level of 0.05. Results are presented
as mean (SD) for continuous and relative frequencies for
categorical data.
Qualitative transcripts were analyzed thematically,
with grounded theory principles of analysis enabling the
identification, coding, and categorization of primary data
patterns. All transcripts were independently analyzed
and coded by two investigators, assisted by the NVivo
Software program (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version
10, 2012, Victoria, Melbourne).
Results
Results are presented in accordance with the RE-AIM
dimension and associated key evaluation questions
informed by previous literature [33, 37, 40].
Reach
Q1: To what extent did the program reach the target
group?
Broad program reach at both the community and
organizational level was achieved. Groups that en-
gaged readily included local government agencies,
health workers (community health centers, medical
clinics, and hospitals), community groups (women ’s
organizations, neighborhood houses, and sports
clubs), education groups (primary schools, kindergar-
tens, and child care centers), and private groups (local
businesses and recreational centers) (Fig. 2). As previ-
ously reported, n= 649 women were recruited, repre-
senting ~10% of the eligible target population [47, 50].Kozica et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:151 Page 5 of 13

for women of a similar age (25 –54 years) for income
and education [50, 54, 55].
Q2. What were the key motivators and barriers to program
engagement at the participant level (reach)?
As previously described in qualitative analysis, moti-
vators for program participation were convenience of
the program location and perceived program utility
such as weight management and optimisation of life-
style choices, as well as a ttending the program with
peers. Barriers to engagement included lack of ano-
nymity, self-consciousness, and segregated social net-
works in rural settings [50].
Q3: Are healthy lifestyles contagious amongst family
members and the social networks of program participants?
Qualitative participant interviews highlighted that the
HeLP-her Rural program prevention messages reached
beyond participants to their families and households. Of
the intervention participants interviewed, all reported in-
fluencing the health behaviors of their household to vari-
ous degrees such as increasing water, fruit, and
vegetables consumption and physical activity frequency
and limiting high-fat snack foods and takeaways.
It’s a roll on effect because if you ’re eating healthy
yourself and doing healthy meals it follows on to the
kids –[intervention participant]
Participants unable to influence their household health
choices described barriers which primarily related to un-
supportive or resistant family members.
(My husband) he ’s my resistance band. He ’s like, no,
you can have Coke, you can have pies. It ’s very hard
(for me)- [control participant]
I’ve got two kids that are very fussy eaters …At the
end of the day I can ’t be bothered with the arguments
and whinging - [control participant]
In contrast, women were less likely to influence the
health behaviors of their social networks, citing personal
and social reasons. Personal reasons related to feelings
of“embarrassment, ”wanting to maintain “privacy, ”and
“low confidence ”.
My weight is something I ’m very embarrassed about
so I tend not to discuss it with friends. I don ’t
suppose my friends are struggling with it as I am -
[control participant]
Social barriers to broader program reach included lack
of socially acceptability to talk to friends about theirweight and lifestyle choices as they do not want to be
perceived as “self-absorbed ”and “talking about myself
all the time. ”Other participants described that as many
of their friends were already “very active ”and “pretty
healthy, ”there was no need to discuss program learn-
ings. Social isolation was another commonly described
reason for not influencing social networks. Others noted
beliefs that their friends were “unsupportive ”and disin-
terested, “none of my friends are really into exercise and
healthy lifestyles ”.
Consistent with our qualitative findings, quantitative
questionnaire data collected from intervention ( n= 230)
and control participants ( n= 207) at 12 months showed
that 62% of the participants reported influencing health
behaviors of their families. However, there was no statis-
tical significant difference between groups. The partici-
pants were most likely to influence their children (38%),
friends (34%), and partners (30%).
Effectiveness
Q4. Was the HeLP-her Rural program efficacious at preventing
weight gain in intervention participants?
As previously reported, HeLP-her Rural prevented
weight gain at 1 year with the mean weight change from
baseline in the control group at +0.44 kg (95% CI −0.09
to 0.97) and the intervention group at −0.48 kg (95% CI
−0.99 to 0.03), with a between-group difference of
−0.92 kg (95% CI −1.67 to −0.16) or −0.88 kg (95% CI
−1.62 to −0.13) adjusted for baseline values and
clustering [49].
Q5. What were the enablers and barriers to behavior
change sustainability within this program?
Behavior change continuation was facilitated by partici-
pant ’s ability to apply the core program messages such
as setting achievable behavior change goals, problem
solving, and relapse prevention. Improved health know-
ledge, internal motivation, self-efficacy, and internal ac-
countability all supported continued behavior change as
previously described [48].
Adoption
Q7. How many and which organizations supported HeLP-
her Rural program implementation?
We partnered with more than 300 local organizations
across the 41 rural communities with at least three
partners from various community sectors in each
community. Our partnering success rate was 95%
amongst local stakeholders (Table 3). However, local
partners were not required to deliver the interven-
tion, rather to support program implementation and
delivery. Local partners were highly valuable and rea-
sons included the following: (1) providing local in-
sights regarding community so cio-cultural influences,Kozica et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:151 Page 8 of 13
(2) assisting program recruitment through promotion
to professional and social networks, distribution of
promotional material, and validation and legitimisa-
tion of the program, and (3) assisting program deliv-
ery (provision of venues to host the program). As
local partners did not directly deliver the HeLP-her
program, adoption by staff could not be directly
assessed.Q8. Do stakeholders value weight gain prevention
programs?
According to stakeholders, prevention programs were
highly valuable and aligned with rural organizational
health priorities.
I would encourage my managers to support
[prevention programs] because, the demand on the
service for weight management is huge and it is
particularly women - [Local dietician]
Stakeholders partnered with the HeLP-her Rural pro-
gram team due to the underlying robust theory, evidence
base, and simplistic low-intensity design.
The model (program theory) sounded like something
worth promoting. That low commitment program …It
sounded like a good program to support –[Health
Service Manager].
In addition, many stakeholders valued the use of re-
mote methods to deliver lifestyle advice, “It’s new, in-
novative ideas and I think that using digital medium is a
great way. ”
Indeed, due to the low intensity of the program and
minimal resources required, many stakeholders dis-
cussed that their organization would likely have suffi-
cient capacity to implement such a program.
I think we could probably deliver a program like that
ourselves, with the correct information, I mean and
tailoring it to what we ’ve got. Actually I was sitting in
on the program and thinking you know we could do
this –[Community nurse]
Stakeholders provided recommendations to improve
program delivery and optimize future scale-up of pre-
vention programs. As previously reported, key recom-
mendations included the development of multi-level
partnerships, ongoing mentoring relationships via elec-
tronic communication, delivery of programs amongst
outlying rural townships, and the provision of a suite of
implementation resources to support cost and time-
efficient implementation [46].
Implementation
Q9. To what extent had the HeLP-her Rural program been
implemented as per the study protocol?
Process evaluation revealed strong implementation fidel-
ity and high dose delivered and received, confirmed
through administration records, researchers observa-
tions, and completed program devised checklists, as pre-
viously reported. This highlighted the acceptability of
low-intensity healthy lifestyle programs with mixed face-Table 3 HeLP-her Rural partnership development

to-face and remote delivery modes in this population
group. Qualitative participant interviews revealed that
group education sessions were most valued, followed by
text messages and phone coaching. Overall, delivery of
lifestyle advice through multiple delivery modes (group
sessions, phone coaching, text messages, and a program
manual) was recommended by participants to optimize
program acceptability and accommodate diverse learning
styles [47]. A full economic analysis is underway based
on a pending 2-year data analysis and will be reported
elsewhere.
Q10. Were participants satisfied with the HeLP-her Rural
program experience?
Qualitative participant interviews reported a high level
of program acceptability.
I think [the program] is fantastic and just like the fact
that you held it in the first place, I thought oh wow,
there ’s people that are actually out there to help and
yes, it felt like a privilege –[intervention participant]
The 1-year satisfaction surveys showed high partici-
pant satisfaction with 82% of the participants agreeing
they would recommend this program, with more inter-
vention participants recommending the program (90
versus 73%, P< 0.05) and being satisfied with program
support than the controls (84 versus 61%, P< 0.05).
Maintenance
Q11. Is there evidence of an organizational demand for
program continuation post study completion?
The HeLP-her program has been identified as an
evidence-based community program by the Victorian
State Government as part of a state-wide system-based
approach to tackling the rising rates of obesity and pre-
venting obesity-related conditions [56]. This demon-
strates the value of a self-management lifestyle program
to prevent weight gain and the need for comprehensive
evaluation and implementation evidence.
Q12. Utilizing a criteria-based meta-evaluation audit tool,
does the HeLP-her Rural program measure all “core ”RE-
AIM dimensions?
Employing Kessler ’s et al. RE-AIM meta-evaluation tool,
this evaluation assessed all “core ”elements of the RE-
AIM framework, producing a score of 96% for “fully de-
veloped use across all RE-AIM dimensions ”(Table 2)
[40]. We were unable to assess the domain “adoption at
the researcher and staff level ”as this was not applicable.
Discussion
The HeLP-her, low-intensity healthy lifestyle program
has now been delivered in a range of settings andpopulations in a series of RCT ’s where it effectively im-
proves lifestyle and prevents weight gain [4, 17, 49]. The
HeLP-her Rural program achieved broad program reach
across 41 rural townships with most participants report-
ing influencing some of the health behaviors of their
families. Program implementation was supported by 300
multi-level partnerships with partners valuing program
theory and low-intensity program design. Stakeholders
reported capacity to locally implement and sustain the
program. The HeLP-her Rural program prevented a
weight gain of nearly 1 kg on average amongst women
living in rural Australia. The US Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality defines a weight difference of
0.5 kg between groups as clinically significant and mean-
ingful. Notably, a modeling study estimated that a 1-kg
weight loss, if applied across the USA population, could
avoid 2 million cases of diabetes, 1.5 million cases of car-
diovascular disease, and more than 73,000 cases of can-
cer [57]. These findings add new information on
effective weight gain prevention strategies, mirroring
current clinical guidelines and addressing international
health priorities to halt the obesity epidemic.
The RE-AIM framework was developed to facilitate
translation of research findings into improved popula-
tion health outcomes, focusing on increasing the
reporting of implementation strategies and external
program validity [41]. A systematic review of the RE-
AIM framework shows broad application to health
promotion programs mainly around chronic disease.
However, the framework has been inconsistently and
sometimes incorrectly applied across all five dimen-
sions [40, 41]. Reporting all RE-AIM dimensions and
criteria is critical with interdependent relationships
important for public health impact [41]. Updated RE-
AIM criteria [40] recommend qualitative research to
improve understanding of results, yet this is rarely
employed [40, 41]. Here, we address key evaluation
and obesity lifestyle prevention gaps by applying
qualitative and quantitative research methods and ex-
tending evaluation to all RE-AIM dimensions. Subse-
quently, increasing the generalizability of our results
to obesity prevention programs more broadly.
Here, we targeted rural women based on high rates of
weight gain, risk of obesity and related complications,
adverse impact on maternal and child short- and long-
term health, and relative disadvantage for rural women.
Despite reported difficulties in engaging socio-economic
disadvantaged groups into research [58], we reached
women from disadvantaged communities who were
representative of regional women of a similar age (25 –
54 years) based on income, household size, and educa-
tion [54]. We note that participants reported directly
influencing their household ’s lifestyle behaviors, such as
improving fruit and vegetable intake and physical activityKozica et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:151 Page 10 of 13
frequency and reducing discretionary food and take-
away consumption. Research exploring the relation-
ship between lifestyle changes in women participating
in healthy lifestyle programs and family reach is lim-
ited. Further research exploring measurable impact of
participant ’s reports of influence with members of the
household is needed. However, our results support
the potential importance of targeting reproductive-
aged women [59 –61], due to their influential role in
influencing household lifestyle behaviors and food
choices [62].
The HeLP-her Rural program and evaluation has
addressed the dearth of lite rature surrounding the ac-
ceptability of low-intensity weight gain prevention
programs in young women [59, 63]. The program has
successfully engaged 1127 women across three large
RCT ’s, emphasizing that low-intensity programs ap-
peal to women from highly diverse socio-economic,
ethnic, and educational backgrounds [4, 17, 47]. Fur-
thermore, we have shown that a combination of deliv-
ery modes (face-to-face, phone coaching, text
messages, and program manuals) optimizes program
acceptability and delivers effectiveness. This is in
keeping with a recent systematic review reporting the
effectiveness of using diverse e-health methods (email-
ing, texting, phone apps, and websites) to prevent
and manage obesity [64]. Supporting the high value
of weight gain prevention programs in women, 92%
of intervention participants reported that they would
recommend this program. Conversely, intensive
weight loss programs are generally poorly received
with low engagement and high attrition rates [65].
The value and effectiveness of low-intensity weight
gain prevention programs demonstrated here can in-
form the design and execution of prevention pro-
grams and strategies more broadly.
Implementing, scaling up, and sustaining evidence-
based lifestyle programs in diverse real-world settings
are notoriously challenging, yet they are fundamental
to improve public health outcomes [66]. Here, we re-
port on the strong potential for program adoption
and scale-up, related to broad community reach, ef-
fectiveness, low-intensity program design, and high
acceptability at the participant and organizational
levels. Supporting the value of the prevention-based
programs at the organizational level, we successful
partnered with local organizations. Stakeholders val-
ued the underlying program theory and design and
alignment of the program objectives with their
organizational health priorities because this was a
unique professional development opportunity. These
partnerships were essential to optimizing program im-
plementation, especially in relation to participant en-
gagement. As previously reported [46], stakeholdersrecommended strategies for optimizing program sus-
tainability and scale-up including building local cap-
acity, developing partnerships and minimizing
implementation costs [67, 68]. Moving forward, the
HeLP-her program is ready for delivery by local rural
health professionals with an interest in weight gain
prevention. To date, training of rural communities by
the HeLP-her Rural research team has occurred to
support professional capacity building of the rural
workforce. Funding has been provided by the Austra-
lian government preventative health taskforce to re-
fine resources, engage, and adapt considering ethnic
diversity and for initial steps in community roll-out
[69]. However, to enable program sustainability long-
term funding is required, and partnerships with
funders in a range of setting are currently in
development.
Study strengths and limitations
Study strengths include utilizing a robust mixed
methods evaluation design with an underpinning theor-
etical framework and a meta-evaluation that revealed all
“core ”RE-AIM elements were assessed. However, we
note that “adoption ”at the staff level was unable to be
measured within this context due to program design.
Limitations include that our program checklists explor-
ing program fidelity and contextual influences were
completed by researchers involved in the trial, rather
than independent evaluators. Contextual factors and
characteristics could also have been further explored.
Furthermore, whilst comprehensive 2-year weight data
and program economic analysis are underway, these data
are needed to inform program maintenance. Given a
large amount of data needed to meet all “core ”RE-AIM
dimensions, a staged approach to data collection and
analysis in RE-AIM evaluation is common.
Conclusions
Evidence-based obesity prevention programs such as the
HeLP-her healthy lifestyle program have potential for
population level scale-up, with broad reach beyond dir-
ect participants, demonstrated effectiveness across a
range of populations and settings, low-intensity design,
and high acceptability at the community and stakeholder
levels. Here, we report strong program implementation
rigor and comprehensive application of the RE-AIM
framework. Moving forward, there is a clear need to re-
define lifestyle program success if we are to deliver pub-
lic health impact. Success must extend beyond
effectiveness to incorporate program reach, adoption
and potential for implementation and sustainability in
diverse real-world settings. This is critical to inform pol-
icy and scale-up of lifestyle programs to address the
current obesity epidemic.Kozica et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:151 Page 11 of 13
