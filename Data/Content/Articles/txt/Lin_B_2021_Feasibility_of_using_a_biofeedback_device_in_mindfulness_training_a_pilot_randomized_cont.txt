Feasibility of using a biofeedback device in
mindfulness training - a pilot randomized
controlled trial
Brenna Lin, Christopher Prickett and Steven Woltering*
Abstract
Background: Stress can negatively impact an individual ’s health and well-being and high levels of stress are noted to
exist among college students today. While traditional treatment methods are plagued with stigma and transfer
problems, newly developed wearable biofeedback devices may offer unexplored possibilities. Although these products
are becoming commonplace and inexpensive, scientific evidence of the effectiveness of these products is scarce and
their feasibility within research contexts are relatively unexplored. Conversely, companies are not required, and possibly
reluctant, to release information on the efficacy of these products against their claims. Thus, in the present pilot, we
assess the feasibility of using a real-time respiratory-based biofeedback device in preparation for a larger study. Our
main aims were to assess device-adherence and collaboration with the company that develops and sells the device.
Method: Data were collected from 39 college students who self-identified as experiencing chronic stress at a
Southwestern university in the USA. Students were randomized into either a mindfulness-only control group without a
biofeedback device ( n= 21), or an experimental group with biofeedback device ( n=1 8 ) .B o t hg r o u p sr e c e i v e d
mindfulness meditation training. Pre-test and post-test procedures were conducted 2 weeks apart. Further, both
participant compliance and company compliance were assessed and collaboration with the company was evaluated.
Results: Participant device-adherence as well as the company ’s collaboration necessary for a full-scale study was
determined to be low. This may also have affected our results which showed a strong main effect for time for all
outcome variables, suggesting all groups showed improvement in their levels of stress after the intervention period. No
group by time effects were identified, however, indicating no added benefit of the biofeedback device.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest feasibility of future studies requires full collaboration and detailed and agreed upon
data sharing procedures with the biofeedback company. The particular device under investigation added no value to
the intervention outcomes and it was not feasible to continue a larger-scale study. Further, as the technology sector is
innovating faster than it can validate products, we urge for open science collaborations between public and private
sectors to properly develop evidence-based regulations that can withstand technological innovation while maintaining
product quality, safety, and effectiveness.

Background
Stress and barriers to treatment
Mental health problems related to stress and anxiety are
an increasingly prevalent issue facing college students
today [ 1–7]. This is an alarming trend considering the
host of negative associations related to stress and anxiety
such as decreased academic performance1 [ 8–10],
school satisfaction [ 11], depression [ 5,6,12], health
problems [ 13,14], substance use [ 5,15–18], poor sleep
[19], unhealthy eating behavior [ 18,20], and reduced
self-efficacy [ 21,22]. With this in mind, stress is an im-
portant target for prevention and treatment on college
campuses. Despite the general effectiveness of cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) [ 23–28], there are problems
reducing its ultimate usefulness as a treatment for some
people related to a lack of help-seeking behavior due to
stigma, time-constraints, privacy concerns, and costs
[29–31]. Furthermore, a problem that traditional treat-
ment faces is the difficulty individuals experience apply-
ing the techniques learned in therapy to real life
emotionally charged problems. This has also been
dubbed the transfer problem [ 32]. Notably, stress and
anxiety may be particularly susceptible to the transfer
problem as patients often receive interventions in calm,
controlled settings removed from distressing events or
triggers that may lead to stressful thoughts or feelings.
Once faced with these stressors, however, they may find
it difficult to apply what was learned in therapy in these
moments when they lack situational control. Further-
more, the emotions of fear that grip people in stressful
states is characterized by reduced cognitive control and
a rigid fixation on perceived concerns [ 33–35] making it
even more challenging to break loose from habitual and
unhelpful thought patterns.
With the above in mind, it is important to consider
and develop treatment options that can effectively re-
duce stress and anxiety while also circumventing the
many barriers that reduce the usefulness of traditional
treatment related to help-seeking and transfer. The pri-
mary aim of the present pilot was to assess the feasibility
of testing a low-cost wearable biofeedback device based
on mindfulness medication techniques in college stu-
dents with high levels of self-reported stress.
Meditation, mindfulness, and biofeedback devices as
possible solutions
Meditation interventions may address some of the short-
comings of traditional treatment. For instance, an array
of resources exists for meditation, including online vid-
eos, apps, and tutorials, addressing the cost and privacy
barriers that exist with traditional treatments. Addition-
ally, meditation is often associated with a lifestyle and
may not carry the stigma of being in therapy which may
make it easier for individuals to seek treatment.Furthermore, self-reported improvements in stress levels
have been indicated in as little as 30 min [ 36,37] redu-
cing the time and commitment needed in order for indi-
viduals to feel and see improvement. Notably, evidence
for the effectiveness of meditation is increasing. Medita-
tion based practices and trainings have been shown to
improve individual ’s abilities to regulate attention [ 38],
improve executive functioning [ 38,39], improve emotion
regulation [ 40], and strengthen neural systems needed
for emotion regulation [ 41]. In relation to stress, a num-
ber of studies have found that regular mindfulness prac-
tices can reduce stress [ 42–44].
Mindfulness, a form of meditation, is characterized as
a way of paying attention in a purposeful way [ 42].
Intentionally directing one ’s attention can be regarded as
a self-regulatory practice and is often achieved through
meditation [ 45]. While mindfulness meditation can refer
to many practices, the core of these practices is the
moment-to-moment awareness of one ’s body and mind,
without judgment or criticism. This is often done by fo-
cusing attention on one ’s own breath, promoting cogni-
tive control [ 46]. Focusing one ’s attention on the present
moment can reduce negative rumination and worry
about the future, common in highly stressed individuals.
The attentional focus on breathing slowly and in a reg-
ulated fashion may help reduce stress as breathing has
significant influence on self-regulatory processes such as
cardiac modulation [ 47]. Individuals under high stress
consistently exhibit erratic breathing patterns, while in-
dividuals under low stress are shown to exhibit slow,
regulated breathing patterns [ 48,49]. The relationship
between the breath and cardiac modulation is bi-
directional, in that changes in breath rate can also influ-
ence stress levels [ 50,51]. Moreover, alterations in
respiratory patterns are proven to affect an individual ’s
physiological and emotional arousal as well as percep-
tions of negative distress [ 50,52,53], while short-term
modification of breathing patterns has been found to re-
duce the subjective experience of stress [ 54]. Solutions
to the transfer problem, however, are more difficult to
find or to practically realize. One would have to have
therapeutic settings closely resemble or simulate the
real-life situations that patients experience their prob-
lems in. This appears hard and costly to do but would, if
realized, likely increase the efficacy of treatment. Indeed,
the benefits of treatment are often the largest when such
an approach is possible.
Various newly developed wearable biofeedback de-
vices, however, may offer unexplored possibilities. Bio-
feedback involves observing one ’s own physiological
responses and modulating behavioral patterns in real
time [ 55], possibly providing a solution to combat the
transfer problem encountered by many health providers.
Wearable biofeedback devices can deliver prompts basedLinet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:84 Page 2 of 13
on continuously monitored physiological signals.
Prompts, such as minor vibrations, text messages, or
other cues, can provide real-time feedback cueing
wearers to adjust unhealthy habits. These devices can re-
mind wearers of their mental and physiological state and
signal them to perform behavioral cues in real-life con-
texts at the exact moments they are actually experiencing
certain emotions. Specifically, a signal to remind individ-
uals to modulate their respiratory patterns may increase
the transfer of learning. Wearable devices also have the
advantage that they are becoming increasingly more af-
fordable and available. Self- tracking of health factors
such as weight, exercise, blood pressure, sleep, and blood
sugar are now commonplace and can be provided at
relatively low-cost [ 56].
Public-private disconnect
Furthermore, biofeedback interventions include modula-
tion and direction of awareness towards one ’s own
physiology, akin to the process of mindfulness. Through
feedback signals from the device, individuals are able to
gain increased awareness of physiological processes and
ideally gain control and modulate these processes. The
use of biofeedback-aided interventions for stress and
anxiety has proven successful with various populations
including school aged children [ 43], college students
[57], professionals [ 58], athletes [ 59], and individuals suf-
fering from mental illnesses, (e.g., depression and post-
traumatic stress disorder) [ 60–62]. A majority of evi-
dence, however, utilizes non-portable biofeedback de-
vices, which limits the ecological validity. Furthermore,
non-portable biofeedback devices are costly and access
to these devices is often restricted, requiring permission
through medical offices or wellness centers. Hence, con-
sidering the limited literature on this topic, there is a
clear need for more robust discussions on the feasibility
of using these biofeedback devices within the context of
randomized control trials (RCT).
In our current day and age, private companies are not
required to provide detailed information regarding feasi-
bility and effectiveness of released products, unless they
are seeking FDA approval. While these devices are rela-
tively inexpensive for individual users, the overall wear-
able market is growing and predicted to increase over
the next few years, with global estimates ranging be-
tween $25 and $44 billion dollars, by 2020 [ 63–65]. The
exponential growth of technology [ 66] has produced an
ecosystem of relatively inexpensive technological prod-
ucts that may or may not provide real clinical value.
Currently, there is a lack of incentivization for private
companies to partner with researchers. Further, these
health-related technological devices do not require clin-
ical trials, to assess the efficacy, prior to making claims.
Despite the large market for this industry, to the best ofour knowledge, literature supporting the use of wearable
biofeedback devices is often theoretical [ 67] or mechan-
ical [ 68,69] in nature, while applied research of products
is scarce (despite a few studies, see [ 70,71]). Moreover,
we could not identify literature pairing wearable biofeed-
back devices with meditation as a treatment option.
Coupling the lack of literature with the vast number of
devices that exist on the market indicates a need to test
the feasibility of these devices as well as evaluate the
quality of participant adherence and collaboration with
private companies.
The current study
The literature suggests a strong potential for meditation
and biofeedback treatments in reducing stress [ 72,73].
Further, because of mindfulness meditation ’s focus on res-
piration and physiology, the integration of respiratory-
based biofeedback and mindfulness meditation appears
evident. Our study had two key objectives. Our primary
objective related to feasibility and had two key compo-
nents. First, we needed to assess adherence with the de-
vice. We will test this using the amount of missing data
due to adherence. Second, we needed to assess the bio-
feedback company ’s communication and transparency.
This was important because if we showed the device was
effective, we would need to determine the mechanism of
action in a larger RCT. This objective could be tested by
our research team gaining access to the algorithms and
raw data. Our expectation was that both the participants
and the biofeedback company with comply with our study
design and data requirements in such as it would be feas-
ible to run a larger scale study.
A secondary objective was to estimate the effectiveness
of a wearable biofeedback device in addition to the ef-
fects of a mindfulness meditation intervention. This was
important because if the device did not demonstrate any
potential effectiveness, we may have to seek a different
type of biofeedback device or question our theoretical
assumptions. If there was evidence that the device con-
ferred added benefit and that data feasibility was accept-
able, we would design a larger and more elaborate study
with a waitlist control group that would confirm these
findings and also test more specifically for the mecha-
nisms of improvement. We note that, due to the current
experimental design of the pilot, we cannot make claims
regarding the effectiveness of the mindfulness treatment
nor the mechanism of action. We can only make claims
as to the estimated added effectiveness of the specific
biofeedback device tested.
Methods
Participants
University students who self-identified as experiencing
chronic stress were recruited through flyers and aLinet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:84 Page 3 of 13
campus wide email on a large Southwestern United
States campus between February and July of 2017. Inclu-
sion criteria were as follows: (1) at least at least 18 years
of age and be a student at time of testing, (2) self-
identify as highly stressed. Exclusion criteria included (1)
major psychiatric or developmental disorders besides de-
pression or anxiety, (2) limited proficiency in English
language.
Sample size
Figure 1shows a detailed chart in accordance with the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
reporting standards of the flow of participants through
our study. Eligible participants were randomized, before
they visited the lab using a simple randomization
scheme through the website www.randomization.com ,
into two arms: a meditation treatment with biofeedback
group (the biofeedback experimental group; final n= 21)
and a meditation without biofeedback group (no-bio-
feedback control group; final n= 18). As no previous
studies have been conducted on this topic, no effect size
could be identified for power analysis. Additionally, as
this was a pilot study, we decided to keep the groups to
approximately 20 each.
Lab procedure
Eligibility screening was conducted via a brief phone call.
Following the eligibility screening, participants visited
the psychology lab, located on the campus of the univer-
sity, for their first visit where they signed informedconsent before data collection began. First, participants
completed a set of questionnaires relating to demo-
graphic data and mental-health functioning (see details
in the “Measures ”section). Next, participants completed
cognitive and behavioral tasks, which are not examined
in the current study and are to be reported elsewhere.
Following these tasks, a relaxation training session was
conducted which utilized mindfulness-based relaxation
techniques [ 42,46]. Randomization was conducted by
the project manager during the mindfulness training ses-
sion to determine group placement of participant into
one of two groups: (1) control group without a biofeed-
back device; (2) experimental group with biofeedback
device. The first lab visit lasted approximately 65 min.
Participants were also notified that a nightly survey
would be sent at approximately 8 pm each night of the
intervention. After 2 weeks, participants returned to the
lab for their second visit, in which outcome data was
collected via questionnaires.
If the participant was randomized into the experimental
group, the research assistant would then conduct hands-
on instruction with the participant on the use of the bio-
feedback device. This included information on how to
properly pair the device to their phone, how to charge the
device at night, and a high-level overview of the app ’s
functionality. After the participant ’s device was properly
paired and basic functionality of the device was under-
stood and verified, the research assistant then provided
the participant with the gift card and provided them infor-
mation about daily surveys to be delivered each night. If
Fig. 1 Flow diagram of participantsLinet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:84 Page 4 of 13
the participant was placed in the control group, the re-
search assistant would provide the participant with a gift
card and ask them to fill out a daily survey that will be
texted to them each night for the duration of the treat-
ment. Participants returned to the laboratory after a 2-
week interval. Participants received a monetary compensa-
tion of $40 ($20 pre-training and $20 post-training follow-
up) for their time in the form of an Amazon gift-card. The
same lab procedures were followed for the second lab
visit. The local ethics review board approved the study.
(Protocol reference: #IRB2015-0786D). This study was
preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT02837016. Regis-
tered 19 July 2016, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT02837016
Mindfulness meditation training
Both arms received mindfulness meditation training.
The mindfulness relaxation training script was designed
by a clinical psychology graduate student and executed
by trained undergraduate research assistants. In this
training, the research assistant began by providing a brief
overview of the theory behind mindfulness meditation
and reviewed why it can work in controlling stress. First,
the research assistants discussed how to breathe slowly
and deeply for relaxation [ 47,50] and monitored the
participants breathing habits to ensure proper breathing
techniques were established before moving on. Then,
the research assistants discussed current theory and re-
search on mindfulness meditation. After that, the re-
search assistant left the room, while a 20-min
mindfulness meditation audio was played on the com-
puter. The audio emphasized awareness of the body and
regulation of the breath [ 42,46,50]. Lastly the research
assistant returned to the room and asked the participant
if s/he has any follow-up questions. Additionally, the re-
search assistant discussed how the participant might be
able to integrate these techniques in their daily lives.
Wearable respiratory-based biofeedback device
A biofeedback device was used that collects continuous
respiration data and claims to provide real-time feedback
through a messenger app when breathing patterns indi-
cate tension. The device, which can sit comfortably on
someone ’s hip, will buzz and vibrate and send a message
to the wearer ’s phone when it detects erratic, defined by
fast and highly variable, breathing patterns. The message
may, for example, gently remind participants to mind
their breath and do a deep breathing exercise to help al-
leviate stress. This device was chosen based on afford-
ability, unobtrusiveness, and its focus on respiration.
Prior to data collection, the authors discussed the de-
sign and goal of the study with a senior member of the
company. We received verbal confirmation we would be
able to receive back end data, such as notifications perday, activity on the app, types of alerts received. This
data could be anonymized based on device ID to allow
for data matching. Further, we were notified that we
would be able to also receive information about the spe-
cific algorithm used. After data was collected, initial
findings were presented and shared with the senior
member of the company.
Measures
A scale was developed in order to gather information on
possible covariates. The scale was administered after
physiological hookup. Frequency of exercise was
assessed using item ‘I exercise often, ’measured on a 5-
point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to
strongly agree. Whether participants were in treatment
or taking medication were assessed using items, ‘Are you
currently receiving any treatment for your stress? ’and
‘Are you prescribed any medications? ”both measured
through dichotomous, yes or no, responses. Alcohol
usage was measured using item ‘How many days a week
do you typically drink alcohol? ’, with a scale between 1
and 7. Last, using the Macarthur Scale of subjective So-
cial Status [ 74], individuals were asked to place them-
selves on a ladder based on their perceived social
standing relative to their community on a scale between
1 and 10. Additionally, at the end of the lab visit, both
groups were asked to answer questions on their motiv-
ation and expectation to change using items ‘How much
do you expect a positive change?, ’and ‘How motivated
are you to try new things to change? ”on a scale from
1—very little to 10 —very much.
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
The STAI is a self-report questionnaire that measures trait
and state anxiety in adults [ 75,76]. The term anxiety is
used to describe both an unpleasant state (state-anxiety)
as well as an individual ’s relatively stable personality trait
that describes an individual ’s proneness towards anxiety
(trait-anxiety) [ 76]. Please note that no clinical or diagnos-
tic procedures were conducted which means findings may
not generalize to individuals with anxiety disorders. Our
findings can only speak to the symptomology associated
with trait and state anxiety. For these reasons, we will
adopt the more generic term ‘stress ’to describe the symp-
toms in this manuscript. The STAI is considered a widely
used, reliable, and valid measure of stress and its sympto-
mology [ 75–77].
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)
The DERS is a self-report questionnaire that measures
multiple aspects of and difficulties with emotion regula-
tion [ 78]. The DERS provides a total score as an indica-
tor of emotion regulation difficulty, as well as subscales
specific to emotion regulation strategies, non-acceptanceLinet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:84 Page 5 of 13
of negative emotional responses, emotional clarity, im-
pulse control, goal-directed behavior, and emotional
awareness. This measure is a widely used and generally
considered a reliable, and well-validated measure captur-
ing difficulties in emotion regulation [ 78,79].
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
The PSS is a self-report measure of how stressful one
perceives his or her own life [ 80]. This scale was used as
evidence indicates the importance and role of cognitive
appraisal in perceptions of stress [ 81]. The PSS provides
a single total score to reflect this stress level. This meas-
ure is a well-published, and generally considered a reli-
able and valid measure of perceived stress [ 80–82].
During conversion from paper to digital format, an error
occurred causing item seven ( ‘In the last month, how
often have you been able to control irritations in your
life?’) to be left off from the questionnaire. Thus, this
item is not reported or reflected within PSS pre-training
or post-training scores.
Compliance
A nightly survey, for the entire 2-week intervention, was
sent to both groups at 8 pm via text message through a
service called Survey Signal [ 83]. This measure was used
as an approximation for device-adherence. We asked
participants to answer this survey as soon as they re-
ceived it. The survey asked questions about whether a
participant had meditated that day. A participant ’s re-
sponse, of either yes or no, was used as a measure of
compliance (see Table 3). All continuously enrolled par-
ticipants were sent both minimum and maximum num-
ber of fourteen surveys, one for each day they were
enrolled in the study. Additional adherence was to be es-
timated based on the biofeedback company ’s user data;
however, the one-time data sent by the company re-
sulted in a low match rate with our device identifiers
and the company then became unresponsive despite
multiple attempts to follow up.
Analysis
SPSS version 24.0 [ 84] was used for the analyses. Re-
peated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was
used to compare the different treatment arms across
time for each of the main outcome measures. For the
main analyses, the STAI will be used to index changes in
anxiety, the PSS will index changes in stress levels,
whereas the DERS will be used to measure changes in
the ability of emotion regulation. To assess group differ-
ences in age, sex, ethnicity, and grade type, chi-square
and independent sample ttest were used. Analyses of
variances (ANOVAs) were used to test group differences
in income, state-anxiety, and trait-anxiety. 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI) are provided for the change-scoresacross session for each group (control and experimental)
and group for each session time point (pre- and post-
treatment).
No missing data existed on major variables (less than
5% for all measures) and no outliers were identified
(scores above 2 standard deviations from the mean). Each
individual was tested and included only once within our
sample and analysis. Additionally, we have no reason to
suspect that measurements for one subject may have
influenced or is related to the measurements of other sub-
jects and participants were explicitly instructed not to dis-
cuss the research study with anyone else.
Results
The campus can be characterized as diverse, featuring
students from urban and rural areas and different ethnic
and socioeconomic backgrounds. Table 1shows demo-
graphic data for the final sample broken down by group.
The baseline values for age, gender, ethnicity, grade
level, income, and state-anxiety and trait-anxiety levels
did not differ among the groups.
Additionally, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
[73] used to confirm high stress and anxiety levels in our
sample through comparison with college-age normative
scores. State-Anxiety refers to an unpleasant state, while
trait-anxiety describes an individual ’s proneness towards
symptoms of anxiety [ 73]. Male and female participants
scored in the 81st and 79th percentiles for state-anxiety,
respectively, while both groups scored above the 90th
percentile for trait-anxiety symptoms. Scores at or above
the 75th percentiles, for both State and Trait-Anxiety,
indicate clinically significant levels of anxiety that may
affect their ability to function [ 73]. Again, chi-square
and ANOVA results indicated no group differences
among our sample (Table 1).
Preliminary analysis examined group differences on
sociodemographic measures between group. See Table 2
for means and standard deviations for pre-training time
and post-training time for both groups. No group differ-
ences on major descriptive variables were found. Eight
additional items were examined: frequency of exercise,
in treatment, taking medication, alcohol usage, social
ladder perception, motivation to change, expectation to
change, and compliance. Chi-square goodness of fit and
ttests were used to assess group differences for each of
the above variables. No significant group differences
were found on all above variables (see Table 3) indicat-
ing no statistically significant group differences between
the control versus experimental group on possible covar-
iates including compliance.
Our first objective regarding feasibility was to test
compliance. While compliance was not statistically dif-
ferent between groups, the low average rate of compli-
ance in both the control ( M= 9.3, SD = 4.6) andLinet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:84 Page 6 of 13
experimental ( M= 8.1, SD = 5.6) groups indicate our
daily device-adherence measure to be insufficient with-
out supplementary data on actual utilization. As for our
secondary objective, the company failed to provide ad-
equate supplementary data needed. We did not receive
access to the raw data or gain insight into the algo-
rithms used to compute “stress level ”from the breathing
signal.
Figure 2shows the data pre-training and post-training
for our four outcome measures: the state anxiety, trait
anxiety, perceived stress, and difficulty in emotion
regulation.
To measure the effects of the wearable biofeedback de-
vice on state anxiety, trait anxiety, perceived stress, and
emotion regulation, four separate 2 (group: experimen-
tal, control) × 2 (time: pre, post) RM-ANOVA with the
outcomes measures as the dependent variable were con-
ducted (Table 4). These analyses showed strong main ef-
fects of time for state anxiety ( F(1,37) = 9.370, p= .004,
ηp2= .202, trait anxiety ( F(1,37) = 23.602, p= .000 , ηp2
= .389, perceived stress ( F(1,37) = 25.65, p= .000 , ηp2=.409, and emotion regulation ( F(1,37) = 5.343, p= .026 ,
ηp2= .126. No main effects of group were identified for
state anxiety ( F(1,37) = 3.089, p= .087, trait anxiety ( F(1,
37) = .320, p= .575, perceived stress ( F(1,37) = .65, p
=.424, or emotion regulation ( F(1,37) = .016, p= .901.
No group × time interaction effect was statistically sig-
nificant (all p’s > .237). Table 4shows the relevant statis-
tics and effects sizes from the RM-ANOVA.
Discussion
Data feasibility
Though participant compliance was not different between
groups, the low average rate of compliance pointed to-
wards a need for the biofeedback company ’sa c t u a l
utilization data to supplement our daily survey. However,
due to lack of shared data regarding user behavior in rela-
tion to these devices and low transparency, we determine
that the feasibility of such a study without full collabor-
ation with private companies is low. The feasibility of fu-
ture studies requires full collaboration with companies
that includes detailed, agreed-upon procedures for dataTable 1 Descriptive statistics by group

sharing. It is essential to ensure data from the back-end,
such as verification that participants were in fact wearing
the device, number of notifications provided by the com-
pany, as well as the user ’s activity once a notification was
received is provided in order to understand how this be-
havior interacts with other measures taken at the lab.
Without this data, adherence can only be estimated and
assumed. While we hoped that a randomized designwould control for consumer behavior surrounding these
devices, feasibility of the study was ultimately jeopardized.
For future studies, we recommend formal written partner-
ships, as well as a detailed data passback policy to ensure
transparency and successful data matching by participant.
Additionally, future studies could design to accommodate
for the low rate of participant adherence. For example,
text messages could be sent as reminders on anTable 2 Means, standard deviations, and 95% paired means confidence intervals for dependent variables by group (control,

intermittent basis. Furthermore, biofeedback devices that
do not require frequent charging and that are waterproof
may work best for younger samples so as to decrease ac-
tions needed for better adherence.
Potential device effectiveness
Our secondary objective, examining whether this par-
ticular wearable respiratory-based biofeedback device
would reduce stress more effectively than mindfulness
meditation alone, ultimately showed no difference. Re-
sults of our small-scale trial showed that participants in
the experimental biofeedback group were not different
from the control group in their change of levels of stress
before and after the treatment period. Our study did find
that both the experimental and control group reported
reduced levels of stress across the treatment period.
As we did not utilize a proper control group to test for
the effect of meditation training alone (e.g., a waitlist or
active control group), it is possible that the beneficial ef-
fect could be due to the administration of the meditation
training which was provided for both arms. Thesefindings suggest that the wearable respiratory-
biofeedback device did not have an added benefit in re-
ducing stress above and beyond mindfulness meditation
training and that the use of this specific device does not
prove feasible for a larger scale study.
The current findings can be explained in several ways.
First, it is possible that the device-algorithm was not
working optimally. From a measurement perspective, ac-
curately capturing respiratory information in real-life sit-
uations, in which participants are constantly moving and
speaking, is challenging [ 85,86]. Being able to link those
signals back to specific emotions, among a possible myr-
iad of other movements and states, may simply have
been too complex. Although some basis for the wearable
device was provided by the company [ 87,88], these pa-
pers did not constitute an actual validation of the algo-
rithms of the device. Unfortunately, we were unable to
obtain the algorithms and, as such, the scientific contri-
bution of our study is more utilitarian than mechanistic.
Second, it is possible that the device was accurately cap-
turing the respiratory signal but that the breath is simply

control) and at both time points (pre- and post-training)Linet al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:84 Page 9 of 13
not a good way to measure stress physiology in real-life
situations. Currently, respiratory measurements are
noted to be widely subjective depending on method-
ology, and previous studies have exposed reliability and
validity issues relating to respiratory rate measurements
[89]. Furthermore, to properly measure the breath, infor-
mation on the rate, the volume, and the pattern must be
reviewed in tandem. And while RSA and HRV are well
validated in the literature, the introduction of new ways
of measuring, such as apps or electrical equipment
within cell phones, combined with possible artifacts gen-
erated through these new data captures, requires much
more evidence to support the use of these devices for a
clinical population. Third, these findings could indicate
that the mindfulness meditation intervention paired with
the breath regulation instruction alone may provide ef-
fective treatment, without the need for the use of a
wearable biofeedback device.
Our results are difficult to situate in the current bio-
feedback literature. To the best of our knowledge,
Gutierrez-Osuna ’s group at Texas A&M University is
only other group that conducted research utilizing a
wearable biofeedback device capturing breathing rate as
a means to influence stress. They showed that breath-
based biofeedback training was more effective in indu-
cing relaxation in participants than electrodermal- and
cardiovascular-based biofeedback [ 90]. Though our stud-
ies are similar in some respects, they differ in that their
study used the device as a training tool to remediate
stress through a video-game interface, whereas in ourstudy the device was used for the recognition of stress
physiological markers.
Limitations
Further limitations of the study should be considered in
the development of a full-scaled study. One limitation is
the lack of a waitlist control group (or active control
group for the meditation alone) precluding statements
regarding the effectiveness of the meditation. No waitlist
control was utilized as we were primarily interested in
the additive effects of the biofeedback device as opposed
to the effects of meditation intervention per se. This
study was planned as a phase 1 exploratory study testing
the feasibility of a particular wearable biofeedback device
that we intended to use in future, more detailed, studies
to assess the general overall of the treatment compared
to a waitlist or to determine the mechanism of action if
results were positive.
Despite this limitation, we do point out that other
studies which have utilized active control by meditation
designs have found meditation interventions to generate
positive effect sizes ranging from 0.30 to 0.67 [ 91,92].
Also, previous studies conducted with students have
found outcome variables relating to stress to either re-
main stable or increase in intensity between pre-test and
post-test [ 85,89]. As students in our study showed sta-
tistically significant decreases in stress measures, we be-
lieve, albeit speculatively, this could suggest that the
meditation treatment was effective for high stress college
students.
Furthermore, a few statistical limitations must be men-
tioned. We decided to run this study as a pilot to a future
larger study as no previous studies have been conducted
on our specific variables of interest and no effect size
could be estimated. Because of this, the recruitment of
highly stressed individuals combined with the smaller
sample size may have affected the variability of our out-
come variables reducing statistical power to detect mean-
ingful findings. Additionally, it is also possible that
regression to the mean, as well as test-retest effects could
account for changes in both the test and control groups.
We also note that the present sample consisted of a
non-clinical sample of college students who self-
reported experiencing high levels of stress. It is possible
findings could be different if a clinical sample was tar-
geted in which people had confirmed diagnoses. Future
clinical trials with diagnosed patients suffering from
stress could help confirm the present findings.
Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that the de-
vice was working properly but that the participants were
simply not adhering to, or misunderstood, the instruc-
tions. We do believe this is unlikely as participants re-
ceived more information on the use of the device than if
they bought the device from the store. Furthermore, ourTable 4 RM-ANOVA results for dependent variables

team also made sure to demonstrate how to properly
wear and use the device. Given the aforementioned limi-
tations, it is important that future studies rigorously
evaluate the validity of wearable biofeedback devices
against currently existing, well-validated treatment
options.
Implications
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its
kind in studying a wearable respiratory-based biofeedback
device in conjunction with mindfulness meditation
through an RCT design. Strengths of this study include
the application of these treatment options within an eco-
logically valid setting and the rigorous design using an ac-
tive control group. Our findings suggest the biofeedback
device provided no additive benefit to mindfulness train-
ing for stressed individuals which could be concerning as
individuals with high stress levels seeking clinical solutions
may be more susceptible to marketing messages. Further-
more, the authors caution against the use of commercially
produced wearable biofeedback devices without Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in clinical
settings and for patient monitoring. However, ultimately,
as various limitations must be considered, future testing is
recommended. Finally, we decided not to continue with
the present company due to challenges related to trans-
parency and information sharing.
Conclusions
The goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using
the biofeedback device, a respiration-based wearable bio-
feedback device claiming to reduce stress in a sample of
college students. As such, our study is among the first to
independently test commercially available biometric
wearables. Our findings showed no added effectiveness
of the specific respiratory-based biofeedback device we
tested in reducing stress. Thus, we believe that
these companies should comply with the same FDA
standards required for medical companies. As it stands
now, the lack of regulation can lead to public confusion
and false hope in health-related industries. Furthermore,
the validation of a commercial product proved difficult
due to limited access to participants' behavior and ad-
herence data regarding the device from the device
maker. We assess that the feasibility of such a study
proves difficult without closer collaborations between in-
dependent scientists and corporation in the research and
development of such devices. With this, we would like
to advocate for the collaboration of the FDA, academics,
and private companies in the development of evidence-
based regulations that will allow for a successful certifi-
cation process that can bolster technological innovation
while maintaining product quality, safety, and effective-
ness. Ultimately, academia ’s role as research andlearning institutions can be strengthened through the
government ’s data collection and regulatory process cap-
abilities, while industry can help close the gap between
research and application through the development of
products. Moreover, the open science research paradigm
[93] can promote data sharing, preregistration, and fund-
ing source databases, and foster trust and collaboration
across industries and disciplines.
