(Received 20 November 2013; accepted 27 January 2014 )
In 1988 a group of pediatricians, developmental, clinical, child and social psychologists,
anthropologists and health educators began researching in Baltimore, Maryland, on anHuman Immunode ﬁency Virus (HIV) prevention intervention, Focus on Youth (FOY). Over
the next 25 years, the questions being addressed by FOY re ﬂected those of the global HIV
research experience. During the ﬁrst phase, the questions being addressed by the broader
research community included: Can HIV risk behaviors be purposefully impacted by
behavioral interventions? If so, how do successful interventions differ from those that are noteffective? Are theory-based interventions more likely to be effective than information-only-
based interventions? Can theories be translated into culturally and developmentally
appropriate interventions including those that are appropriate for children and adolescents?
Should parents be involved –and if so, how? During its next phase, the FOY team
increasingly became concerned with a disturbing reality. A large number of interventions had
been developed and some had been shown to have evidence of impact. But virtually all of
these interventions had been conducted in the USA or Europe. The questions facing
researchers included: With the global burden of HIV disproportionately impacting low- and
middle-income countries (LMIC), especially those in southern Africa, the Caribbean and partsof Asia, what is known about the effectiveness of western-based interventions in theseculturally, racially and economically disparate settings? With the exciting proliferation of
interventions, federal agencies in the USA and international agencies including Joint UnitedNations Programme on HIV/AIDS realized the importance of assessing the research portfolio
and developing metrics of effectiveness. The questions during this phase included: What is an
“effective ”intervention? How are effective interventions implemented in a new setting? This
phase merged with the next phase as researchers and public health workers realized that thedissemination to a new community of an intervention developed and found to be effective in
one community requires change. The central questions during this time included: What
changes or kinds of changes can be made to an intervention without undermining its
effectiveness? What aspects of an intervention cannot be changed without potentially
undermining its effectiveness? What constitutes a “change ”? Who should be involved in this
decision-making? These efforts culminated in our current phase, one focused on
implementation. We must learn more about the factors that allow an intervention to surviveand thrive and selectively target these critical factors. The main objective of this paper is to
review our experiences and lessons learned in developing, implementing and evaluating FOY
in a wide range of socio-cultural settings over the past quarter of century.

The context in which the Focus on Youth research effort was begun
The 1980s witnessed a world drowning in the wake of the surging Human Immunode ﬁency Virus
(HIV) epidemic. By the late 1980s the causative agent had been identi ﬁed and modes of infection
were understood, but modern medicine had little to offer in terms of prevention or treatment. Bio-
medical scientists were furiously working to understand this virus and develop drugs and vaccines
that could slow or reverse its effects and ultimately prevent its spread (Brandt, 2013 ).
Until this time there had been relatively little interaction among behavioral scientists, public
health scientists and biomedical scientists; the era of multidisciplinary teams was starting, butthere was only limited experience with interdisciplinary work. As an early step in this direction,
clinical, public health, behavioral and anthropologic communities began working together todevelop and implement a range of behavioral interventions designed to impact behaviors to
decrease transmission of the disease and decrease its devastating impact.
Care providers and researchers with a particular interest in children and adolescents realized
that beside the psychological and cultural aspects to be considered in creating public health inter-ventions targeting children, adolescents and young adults, developmental aspects must also be
considered.
In 1988, a group of researchers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds began work in Balti-
more, Maryland, on an HIV prevention intervention initially known as Focus on Kids and laterrenamed as Focus on Youth (FOY). (To avoid confusion, in this report, we shall refer to all ofthe activities as FOY.)
Over the next 25 years the questions being addressed have changed considerably, informed by
the global collective research experience. FOY has had the privilege of evolving through thesemany phases.
HIV intervention development: creating the portfolio of prevention interventions
The initial members of the FOY team included anthropologists (with vast experience in partici-
pant observation, focus group discussion, semi-structured individual interviews and quantitativeethnographic techniques such as pile-sorting (Stanton, Aronson, Borgatti, Galbraith, & Feigel-
man, 1993 ; Stanton, Black, Kaljee, & Ricardo, 1993 ); psychologists (with an understanding
and familiarity with theories of behavioral changes, survey construction and developmental
aspects of children and adolescents (Black, Ricardo, & Stanton, 1997 ; Li, Howard, Stanton,
Rachuba, & Cross, 1998 ; Romer et al., 1994 ; Stanton et al., 1995 ); community-based health edu-
cators (with an understanding of community involvement in intervention development) (Galbraithet al., 1996 ); pediatricians (with an understanding of the medical aspects of health and disease in
children and adolescents) (Feigelman, Li, & Stanton, 1995 ; Stanton, Li, Galbraith, Feigelman, &
Kaljee, 1996 ); and statisticians (with the ability to analyze a wide array of longitudinal data and
expertise in instrument development) (Stanton, Li, Black, et al., 1996 ). What each of these pro-
fessional disciplines of the members of the team lacked was a substantial history in workingacross disciplines; what each of the members of the FOY team had in common was the realizationthat we must learn to work together for in isolation, our skills were inadequate to address the
epidemic.
During our initial years of work, the questions being addressed by the broader research com-
munity included: Can HIV risk behaviors be purposefully impacted by behavioral interventions?
If so, how do successful interventions differ from those that are not successful? How do we de ﬁne
and measure success? Are theory-based interventions more likely to be successful than infor-
mation-only-based interventions? Can theories be translated into culturally and developmentally
appropriate interventions including those that are appropriate for children and adolescents? Do232 B. Stanton and X. Li
we involve parents and if so, how? During this phase of FOY, our work was done in collaboration
with the communities and their representatives and the residents themselves, both children and
parents, living in and around the public housing developments in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
Our target audience was early to mid-adolescents, who are capable of reasoning about hypothe-
tical dilemmas as well as adults but draw on different data banks as they are experimenting withnew behaviors with varying potential for risk but do not possess the experience to adequately esti-
mate the consequences of these behaviors. While these age-related characteristics may predispose
them to risk, their individual exposure varies as a result of genetics, family and other environ-mental in ﬂuences (Cauffman & Steinberg, 2000 ; Jacobs-Quadrel, Fischoff, & Davis, 1993 ).
Thus, we viewed our task as creating an intervention that was developmentally targeting mid-ado-lescents but addressed a range of risk exposures prevalent in their communities and propensities
based on personal and familial characteristics about which we would have limited knowledge.
We selected a social cognitive model, Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers, 1983 ),
appealing for its balance of risk and protective considerations. Because we wanted to emphasizeto the youth that actions should be based on decisions, we wanted a model that supported a
Figure 1. Diagram of PMT. PMT (Rogers 1983 ) is a social-cognitive model that posits a balance between
thethreat appraisal pathway and the coping appraisal pathway in deciding whether to engage in a risky or
protective behavior. In assessing the “threat” , we consider the bene ﬁts of the risk behaviors: intrinsic rewards
(Sex feels good; I want to be intimate with my partner); extrinsic rewards (Having sex make me cool) minus
the perceived severity of the consequences of sex (Getting my partner pregnant would not be so bad; getting
HIV would be bad) and one ’s vulnerability (My partner has a reasonable chance of getting pregnant, I have a
low chance of acquiring HIV). In assessing the potential “coping ”response, we assess the effectiveness of
the possible strategy (Condoms are an effective way to prevent HIV if you are going to have sex) and one ’s
ability to perform the protective action (I could buy a condom; I could put a condom on; I am not sure if I
could ask partner to use a condom) minus the Response Cost (My friends say condoms take away the plea-
sure of sex; My partner might think I did not trust her if I asked her to use a condom).Health Psychology & Behavioral Medicine 233
decision-making framework; PMT lends itself very well to such an approach. Figure 1 provides a
graphic illustration of PMT and an example of the application of the theory to a speci ﬁc decision a
hypothetical boy is making about having sex and whether to use a condom.
Guided by PMT, we began our intervention development by two years of participant
observations in which we regularly volunteered in the public housing developments and
recreation centers in which we would be conducting our research. We maintained ﬁeld
notes and began to construct semi-structured interviews for focus group discussions and indi-vidual interviews. The group and individual interviews included various hypothesis generatingand testing exercises such as rank-ordering (listing items in order of importance, risk, appeal,
etc.) and pile-sorting (arranging items in clusters and then explaining the characteristics in
common which resulted in their shared groupings) (Stanton, Aronson et al., 1993 ; Stanton,
Black et al., 1993 ).
These exercises, followed by an iterative process of pilot testing, enabled us to draft both a
risk/protective assessment tool, the Youth Health Risk Behavioral Instrument (YHRBI) and the
FOY intervention. The resulting YHRBI consisted of approximately 200 questions each of
which was relevant to one or more of the eight constructs of the PMT; therefore, we would beable to address not only whether the intervention worked (e.g. increases in knowledge, protective
intentions and behaviors) but also how it was working (e.g. which of the eight constructs had
shown improvement –such as increased self-efﬁ cacy to perform the protective maneuver or
decreased perception of external rewards to partake in the risk behavior) (Stanton, Li, Ricardo,
et al., 1996 ).
The resulting FOY intervention was eight sessions (each session about 75 minutes in length),
each session addressing several of the PMT constructs through games, storytelling, demon-strations and factual presentations. Unique aspects of the curriculum including the requirement
that the youths develop community projects to practice working with others (Self-perceptionTheory), delivered to “natural friendship ”groups, a story about a ﬁctional family is used to con-
textualize decision-making and risk that appeared throughout the curriculum, discussion andapplication of a decision-making model to various situations throughout the curriculum. Thefront cover of the Focus on Kids training manual is shown in Figure 2 .
FOY was assessed through a randomized, controlled trial of 76 naturally formed peer groups
consisting of 383 (206 intervention and 177 control) African-American youths 9 –15 years of age
recruited from six public housing developments in Baltimore, Maryland. The YHRBI which
assessed perceptions, intentions and self-reported sexual behaviors was administered to all
subjects at baseline (pre-intervention), 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months later (Fang, Stanton, Li,Feigelman, & Baldwin, 1998 ; Li, Stanton, Feigelman, & Galbraith, 2002 ). In brief, self-reported
condom-use rates were signi ﬁcantly higher among intervention than control youths (85% vs.
61%; p< .05) at 6-month follow-up, although the difference was no longer signi ﬁcant at
12 months. The intervention impact at 6 months was especially strong among boys and among
early teens (13 –15 years old). Self-reported condom-use intention was also increased among
intervention youths at 6 months but not at 12 months. Following a booster administered at
15 months and again at 27 months, intervention impact again became signiﬁ cant. The conclusions
from this trial were that a theory-based and culturally and developmentally appropriate behavioralintervention delivered to small groups of youth can increase adolescent protective behaviors andreduce risk perceptions, intentions and some behaviors for periods up to six months but require
additional boosters to be sustained.
Unanticipated were qualitative ﬁndings from both the youth and their parents throughout all
phases of the study: parents would like to be able to be involved but lack the speci ﬁc knowledge
and skills to conduct conversations with their children on topics addressing sexuality. Accord-
ingly, the FOY team undertook the development of a parental monitoring intervention, using a234 B. Stanton and X. Li
similar approach to that described earlier for the development of FOY. Ultimately in collaboration
with a professional videographer (Video Press, Baltimore, Maryland), the resultant intervention
(Informed Parents and Children Together (ImPACT)) included a 22-minute video (Protect YourChild from Acquired Immunode ﬁcinecy Syndrome (AIDS) ) followed by a condom demonstration
involving the parents and two role plays with six simple messages: (1) talk to your children aboutsex before they have sex; (2) talking about sex is awkward –atﬁrst; (3) know where your child is,
with whom your child is with and what your child is doing; (4) condom-use skills; (5)

communication skills are important and require listening and practice; and (6) your child wants to
talk to you (Li, Feigelman, & Stanton, 2000 ; Romer et al., 1999 ; Yang et al., 2006 ).
The effectiveness on ImPACT on both parent and youth outcomes was assessed two and six
months post-intervention through a randomized controlled trial of 237 parent –youth dyads who
were randomized at the level of the dyad to receive ImPACT or a dose-matched control condition,a goal setting video developed for parents and youth. (The control video was developed after con-
versations with community members as to other skills that they would ﬁnd useful.) At baseline,
parents signi ﬁcantly underestimated youth ’s risk behaviors; but two and six months post-interven-
tion, parents and youth receiving ImPACT compared to controls demonstrated signi ﬁcantly
increased similarity of youth involvement in risk and protective behaviors. Through six
months post-intervention, ImPACT youths and parents demonstrated higher levels of condom-
use skills, but no signi ﬁcant impact on youth risk behavior was found, leading us to speculate
that a parental monitoring intervention such as ImPACT should be given to parents in conjunction
with more traditional youth-centered risk-reduction interventions (Stanton et al., 2000 ).
Accordingly, we undertook a randomized, controlled trial involving 817 African-American
mid-adolescents from 35 low-income sites in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Because FOYhad been demonstrated to reduce risk behaviors through six months post-intervention, all
youth participated in the eight-session, theory-based, small group, risk-reduction intervention.
In addition, 496 youth and parents received the one-session ImPACT intervention, while theremaining 321 dyads received the one-session Goal for It attention-control condition. The
YHRBI was administered to the youth to assess risk and protective behaviors, perceptions and
knowledge at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. At six months post-intervention, FOY plusImPACT reported signi ﬁcantly lower rates of sex, sex without a condom, alcohol use and cigarette
use compared to FOY plus Goal for It. At 24 months post-intervention , 6 of 16 risk behaviors were
signiﬁcantly reduced among FOY plus ImPACT youth compared to 4 of the 7 theory-based
subscales reﬂ ecting signi ﬁcant protective changes (Li, Stanton, & Feigelman, 2000 ; Li,
Stanton, Galbraith, et al., 2002 ; Stanton et al., 2004 ; Wu et al., 2003 ).
Importantly for the national efforts to reduce HIV transmission, several federal and other
national groups had developed processes to identify behavioral interventions with credible evi-
dence of effectiveness in reducing risk behaviors and/protective factors associated with risk beha-
viors. Particularly notable among these efforts was that of the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC). Speci ﬁc to adolescent risk reduction, the CDC ’s Division of Adolescent
Health identi ﬁed through several levels of analysis conducted by CDC staff and external
panels of experts six “Programs that work ”, evidence-based HIV risk-reduction interventions tar-
geting adolescents (Collins et al., 2002 ). These programs were then packaged for dissemination in
partnership with professional health educator national agencies. FOY was included in both ofthese portfolios and in collaboration with Educational Training Resources (ETR) Associates(Scotts Valley, California: Pub.etr.org) two national trainings (reaching 64 trainers from across
the USA) were conducted. FOY was identi ﬁed in several other US sites identifying effective pro-
grams including SAMHSA ’s National Registry of Effective Programs, the Urban Institute ’s“Teen
Risk Taking: Promising Prevention Programs and Approaches ”and the US Of ﬁce of Population
Affairs ’Program ’s“Archives
on Sexuality, Health and Adolescence ”. By the later 1990s, to our
knowledge there were sites in 12 states throughout the USA in which FOY had been offered to at
risk youth (Galbraith, 2004 ; Galbraith et al., 2009 ). The FOY team itself conducted a longitudinal
trial of a rural adaptation of FOY in West Virginia (D ’Alessandri et al., 2003 ; Stanton et al., 2005 ,
2006 ). While some of the groups and individuals adapting FOY to new settings conducted ran-
domized controlled trials to evaluate the program and published the results (e.g. Bell et al., 2007 ;
Gaydos et al., 2008 ; Morrison et al., 2007 ), although we suspect that the majority did not conduct
effectiveness trials.236 B. Stanton and X. Li
The “big picture ”ﬁndings from this phase of research included the following: (1) anthropo-
logic and psychological approaches can be employed to produce an effective theory-based, cul-
turally and developmentally based intervention; and (2) youth and parents desire parental
involvement in sexual risk-reduction efforts and their involvement augments the impact of the
intervention.
The global epidemic: adapting effective interventions to new settings
Although grati ﬁed with our US-based efforts and results, the FOY team had increasingly become
troubled by a disturbing reality. A large number of interventions had been developed and some
had been shown to have evidence of impact. But virtually all of these interventions –and
especially those that had been evaluated –had been conducted in the USA or Europe. By the
end of the twentieth century, 94% of persons infected with HIV were living in the developingworld; 86% of those infected lived in sub-Saharan Africa, home to only 9% of the world ’s popu-
lation. In several of these countries, the sero-prevalence exceeded 25% (Iliffe, 2006 ). And, closer
to home of the USA, two countries in the Caribbean had rates in excess of 4% and 5% (Wheeler &Radcliffe, 1994 ). Particularly concerning the FOY group, youth between the ages of 10 and 24
accounted for more than 50% of new post-infancy infections worldwide.
The questions facing researchers during this phase included: With the global burden of HIV dis-
proportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially those in southernAfrica, the Caribbean and parts of Asia, what do we know about the effectiveness of western-based
interventions in these culturally, racially and economically disparate settings? Many of us were
being asked to bring our interventions to these different settings. What is the process for adapting
effective interventions to new settings? How do researchers from different continents form partner-ships with communities without living and working together? During this phase, we worked (and
continue to work) with many communities across the globe in Africa (Namibia), Asia (China
and Vietnam) and the Caribbean (The Bahamas, Tobago and Trinidad).
The issues confronted and subsequent journeys of the FOY curriculum and team in these settings
varied tremendously. In two settings (Namibia and The Bahamas), the thrust of our efforts remaineddirected toward adolescents; accordingly, these are the international efforts which will be featured in
this manuscript. In China, although several trials were conducted among adolescents (Cottrell et al.,
2005;L ie ta l . , 2004, 2008; Zhang, Li, Shah, Baldwin, & Stanton, 2007; Zhang et al., 2004, 2010)
given the age of sexual initiation, ultimately we felt our efforts were more appropriately directed
toward young adults. These efforts (with examples of relevant publications) include rural to
urban migrants and sex workers (Hong et al., 2006;L ie ta l . , 2006; Liu et al., 2006;Y a n ge ta l . ,
2004) and other issues of great importance requiring research attention such as children whoseparents were living with or had succumbed to AIDS (Hong et al., 2011;L ve ta l . , 2010;T ue ta l . ,
2009;Y ue ta l . , 2013;Z h a oe ta l . , 2007, 2009). Likewise in Vietnam, with an older age of sexual
initiation, our efforts were focused on young adults (Kaljee et al., 2005, 2011). Therefore, since
this manuscript is focused on adolescents, we shall not describe the efforts in detail here.
Although the age ranges were similar to those that we had addressed in the USA, in Namibia
and The Bahamas there were many aspects of the situations which were quite different. Therefore,in both settings we elected to conduct ethnographic and some survey work to adapt the curriculumto these different settings.
Namibia
Ourﬁrst experience was in Namibia. Namibia achieved independence from South Africa after a
protracted war ending in 1990. In 1993 the First National HIV Prevalence Study was conductedHealth Psychology & Behavioral Medicine 237
and found the sero-prevalence to be 5%. The results were met with shock and uncertainty and so
the survey was repeated in 1994, revealing a sero-prevalence of 8%. The third such study wasconducted in 1996, revealing an overall rate of 15%, with the rate as high as 25% in Caprivi
(Fitzgerald et al., 1999 ). The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Mission Director was
aware of FOY and invited us to work with the Ministry of Health, of Youth and Sport and
UNICEF to develop FOY to an intervention appropriate for Namibia.
The Ministry of Education and UNICEF made the decision to focus the initial efforts in two
districts with especially high rates of HIV. Efforts to determine if FOY were appropriate for theNamibian setting including conducting focus group discussions and some individual interviews
among students in the upper school (high school). The ages of these students varied considerably
with most of the females being in their mid- to late teens, while the males also included former
freedom ﬁghters in their 20s who had returned to complete their education after independence.
Using the information obtained from these interviews, we adapted the YHRBI to better re ﬂect
the issues facing these youth in Namibia, but maintained the general structure of the question-naire, including the underlying theory (PMT) which appeared to be consistent with their
decision-making frameworks. The revised instrument (renamed by the Namibian partners ofthe team to “Towards a Healthy Namibia ”) was administered to 922 youth. The results generally
conﬁrmed the applicability of PMT and of the general FOY curriculum, but identi ﬁed many
differences which required adaptation of the curriculum including signi ﬁcant differences in per-
ceptions and risk behaviors by gender, very limited knowledge regarding HIV, limited access to
condoms throughout the nation and very high use of alcohol (Stanton et al., 1999 ). The resulting
Namibian version of the intervention was renamed “My Future is MY Choice! ”including six
additional sessions to accommodate new facts, more local stories to illustrate points, and sessionsregarding gender inequality and alcohol use. The same format of stories, discussions, vignettes
and time for questions was retained with an emphasis on decision-making, condom skills, nego-tiating skills and gender rights (Fitzgerald et al., 1999 ; Stanton et al., 1998 ). A randomized, con-
trolled trial was conducted among 515 (262 intervention) youth in 10 secondary schools.Although it was delivered after school, there was an 80% participation rate among the students.As we had found in the prior survey, there were highly signi ﬁcant gender differences across the
majority of variables. There were signi ﬁcant increases in knowledge skills, perceptions and inten-
tions. Use of condoms remained very low at least in part due to lack of access (Fitzgerald et al.,1999 ; Stanton et al., 1999 ). The Ministry of Health and UNICEF devised a strategy to increase the
supply of condoms throughout the nation based on these results. The subsequent story of “My
Future Is MY Choice ”is very heartening. The curriculum is owned by Namibia. Last posting
by UNICEF ( 1999 ,2007 ), the curriculum was implemented in middle and high schools
through Namibia to over 160,000 students. It was identi ﬁed by Joint United Nations Programme
on HIV/AIDS as a “Best Practices ”HIV curriculum in 2000. In a subsequent “south-to-south ”
transfer, Namibian educators taught the intervention to Mozambique educators who implemented
it in 13 districts through the Ministry of Youth and Sports. The last posting on the internet indi-
cates that 15,000 Mozambique youth had been trained in the intervention (UNICEF Mozambique,2004 ).
The Bahamas
Halfway around the world from Africa, the Caribbean was also struggling with the HIVepidemic.
In the mid-1990s, the sero-prevalence in the recently independent Commonwealth of The
Bahamas approached 5%. The government aggressively mounted an impressive effort tocombat the epidemic (Wheeler & Radcliffe, 1994 ). In 1998, the government learned about
FOY and invited members of the team to work with the Ministry of Health to adapt FOY for238 B. Stanton and X. Li
use in The Bahamas. The adaptation, resulting in a 10-session intervention with the 2 additional
sessions addressing alcohol use, was initially pilot-tested among adolescent females attending aschool for pregnant teens.
The pilot test indicated that the program was effective, but the Ministries of Education and
Health jointly decided that a more effective national strategy would be the development of aprogram targeting younger youth, ideally before they had initiated sex. The program was
further modi ﬁed to be developmentally appropriate and was named Caribbean Focus on Youth
(FOYC). While FOYC was well-received in focus groups and a pilot test among grade 6 students,
the students, parents and teachers indicated a preference to have a companion parent intervention
(Yu et al., 2006 ). They were interested in a program similar to the US-based parental monitoring
intervention “ImPACT ”described earlier, but wanted an approach which better reﬂ ected the
developmental needs of the younger age of the youth (preteens rather than teens) and the Baha-
mian culture. Similar to ImPACT, the new parent intervention, Caribbean Informed Parents and
Children Together (CImPACT) was built around a video (Keeping the Promise ) lasting about
25 minutes. (Click link to view segments of Keeping the Promise ,https://www.dropbox.com/s/
gq5v6o2079y2f0t/VTS_01_1.VOB .) This video, ﬁlmed in The Bahamas, was adapted to be cul-
turally appropriate for The Bahamas and developmentally appropriate for the age of the target
children (pre-adolescence, rather than early– mid-adolescence). Although the general messages
regarding parenting were similar to the original US-based version, they were more appropriate
to the younger youth and reﬂ ected the local culture. While ImPACT was delivered to the
parent –youth dyad, CImPACT was delivered to small groups of parent –youth dyads. Similar to
ImPACT, a condom demonstration and role play followed the showing of the video; in addition,a1 5 –20-minute discussion followed. The Bahamian government wished to conduct an effective-
ness trial of FOYC and CImPACT. The same parent control that had been used in the USA (thejob skills preparation entitled “Goal for it ”) was felt by participants in focus groups to be suitable
for use without remaking it. However, for the control comparison for FOYC, The Bahamian
Ministry of Education desired a program that itself would be of bene ﬁt to the youth and requested
an environmental program. In collaboration with an ecology consultant, the West Indian Whistling
Duck and Wetlands Conservation Project and the Bahamian Land Trust, we designed a dose-equiv-
alent environmental conservation intervention targeting Bahamian waterways and marshes entitled
the Wondrous Wetlands.
In collaboration with The Bahamian Ministries of Health and of Education, the FOY team con-
ducted a three-celled randomized controlled trial among 15 of New Providence ’s 26 government
elementary schools involving 1360 students and their parents of the estimated 1900 studentsattending the schools. Five schools each were randomized to receive FOYC plus CImPACT
(436 youth and a parent), FOYC plus Goal for It (427 youth and a parent) and the Wondrous
Wetlands plus Goal for It (497 youth and a parent). Six assessments were performed (baseline
through 36 months follow-up) employing a Bahamian version of the YHRBI. As shown in
Figure 3 , youth receiving FOYC (and especially the youth randomized to receive CImPACT)
demonstrated consistently higher knowledge, intentions to use a condom if they were to have
sex, their self-ef ﬁcacy regarding condom use and at 36 months post-intervention, higher
condom-use rates (Chen et al., 2009 ,2010 ,2012 ; Deveaux et al., 2007 ). As in our previous
work, besides assessing intervention impact, the data collected permitted us to explore manyrelated aspects of sexual decision-making including peer, neighborhood and parental in ﬂuences
(Liu et al., 2007 ; Stanton, Jones, et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 2013 ; Yu et al., 2008 ), the development
of assessment instruments (Deveaux et al., 2007 ;
Stanton et al., 2009 ) and the exploration of the
many experiences gained through complex, community- and school-based research (Deveaux
et al., 2011 ). We are currently completing a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of
a modi ﬁed version of CImPACT administered to grade 10 students. Utilizing all eight governmentHealth Psychology & Behavioral Medicine 239
high schools on the island of New Providence, we are able to examine the impact of the modi ﬁed
version of FOYC administered at this grade level (with or without CImPACT) among naïve grade
10 students (e.g. those who had no prior exposure to FOYC) but also the impact on those who pre-viously had received FOYC in grade 6. Because several hundred of the students were enrolled in
both the grades 6 and 10 studies, we were able to determine that the intervention was still impactful
four years later (Stanton, Chen, et al., 2012 ). Through a series of analysis examining various com-
binations of the grade 10 intervention status and that of the grade 6 study, we were able to deter-
mine that six months post-Bahamian Focus On Older Youth (BFOOY) intervention, receipt of
BFOOY by youth who had notreceived FOYC in grade 6, resulted in increased HIV knowledge
and condom-use skills. By contrast BFOOY grade 10 youth who hadreceived FOYC in grade 6
already had increased knowledge and condom-use skills at baseline compared to those of the unex-posed grade 10 youth; these youth did not receive a signi ﬁcant increase from the additional
exposure to BFOOY. However, if instead of controlling for baseline differences between the
two groups in grade 10 (since the differences did result from prior exposure among one group
to the intervention), the youth receiving both interventions (e.g. FOYC in grade 6 and BFOOYin grade 10) displayed both a carryover effect from the FOYC and an additional boost from
BFOOY, and thus demonstrated the highest scores six months post-intervention in condom-use
skills (Dinaj-Koci et al., 2012 ). These data provide support for the importance of continued teach-
ing of the curriculum in grade 6, but also suggests that the second exposure in grade 10 to the cur-
riculum serves a useful and valuable purpose: it has a signi ﬁcant impact on youth who missed the
grade 6 exposure and serves to effectively boost the skills of the youth who did receive FOYC back
in grade 6.

What happens after we leave?
This work was remarkably exciting and gratifying. It was very ful ﬁlling to know that at some time
our efforts had touched children, adolescents and parents in settings across the globe. Still, many
times we wondered –what happened after we left? Were our former research trainers still using
the curriculum? One member of our research team was a health educational doctoral student at the
time who elected to conduct her dissertation exploring sustained implementation and ﬁdelity of
the multiple FOY trainings around the globe. She identi ﬁed over 300 individuals who had
been trained to deliver FOY in some venue in multiple sites across the globe; through adecision-making tree she sought to interview the 43 trainers she identi ﬁed who had implemented
FOY within the past year. She was able to administer a cross-sectional telephone survey to 34
(73%) of the targeted individuals, assessing how the interviewer or organization had adhered
to, adapted, dropped or altered the intervention. None of those interviewed had implemented
all of the critical elements of the intervention (“ Core Elements, vide infra ). She concluded that
more effort is needed to reﬂ ect the constraints practitioners face in non-research settings
(Galbraith, 2004 ; Galbraith et al., 2009 ). Her work, conducted about a decade again, helped to
set the stage for the next phase of intervention focus at a national and global level, identifyingand preserving the components of effective interventions.
Bringing evidence-based interventions to the community
As more and more HIV prevention interventions were developed through the decade of the 1990s,
public health professionals and researchers contemplated the next steps for the prevention ﬁeld.
While countless HIV prevention programs had been developed, many had never been evaluated,
and some that had been evaluated had not been shown to be effective but were still being
implemented and/or disseminated. With the exciting proliferation of interventions, federalagencies in the USA and international agencies realized the importance of assessing the research
portfolio and developing metrics of effectiveness. At a broad level, the goals were to enable com-
munities and agencies desiring to protect their residents, members or students to be able to selectan intervention that had already been developed and found to be effective and to guide them as to
which effective intervention might best suit their needs. The questions during this phase included:
How do we –and who is “we”–determine what an effective intervention is? How –and who –
trains new communities in the implementation of an effective intervention in a new setting? As
part of this response, the CDC created the Prevention Research Synthesis program whosecharge was to convert evidence from the published research literature into practical informationaccessible to prevention providers, researchers and health departments (local and state) through-
out the USA and beyond. CDC staff and panels of experts conducted rigorous, structured ef ﬁcacy
assessments in which they adhered to prede ﬁned strict criteria de ﬁning criteria for the evidence
base; only those programs achieving one of two levels of evidence (Best andGood Evidence )
were accepted. First published in 1999 with periodic updates thereafter, the evidence-based inter-
ventions (EBIs) were listed and described in the Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions
with Evidence of Effectiveness. The Risk Reduction Chapter of the Compendium included valua-
tions of the interventions, had to have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, been identi ﬁed
through systematic search, focused on an HIV, AIDS and/or Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)behavioral prevention intervention, included a comparison condition, been conducted in the USA
and report atleast one behavior directly impacting HIVor biologic measures of HIVor other STD
infections. At its most recent update in 2011, the Risk Reduction chapter included 74 EBIs: 44
Best-Evidence and 30 Good -Evidence interventions. FOY plus ImPACT was selected as one of
the Best-Evidence EBIs. (See http://www.effectiveinterventions.org for more details.)Health Psychology & Behavioral Medicine 241
What this Compendium does offer as a stand-alone product is an easily accessible list of inter-
ventions determined to be effective along clearly de ﬁned criteria and contained a brief description
of the target audience, format and content of the intervention. What it does notaccomplish is the
provision of a manual useful for interested groups to guide and facilitate their implementation
efforts. Therefore, despite a directory of the many well-evaluated interventions found to be effec-tive, there was still limited utilization of EBIs in the ﬁeld. (For more information, see www.cdc.
gov/hiv/dhap/prb/prs/index.html .)
Accordingly, the Capacity Building Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS, Center for Diseases and
Prevention instituted a companion program, the Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions
(DEBI) program (Collins, Harshbarger, Sawyer, & Hamdallah, 2006 ; Dolcini et al., 2010 ; Lyles,
Crepaz, Herbst, & Kay, 2006 ; McKleroy et al., 2006 ). The DEBI program was designed to de ﬁne
and implement a national-level plan for the training, ongoing ﬁeld support and general trouble-
shooting to support the implementation of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions to
state and community HIV programs throughout the USA. To be included as a DEBI program,
an intervention had to be a Best-Evidence EBI, the CDC staff needed to determine that the inter-
vention could be packaged, and the developers needed to be willing to have the program packagedand to participate in the effort. FOY with ImPACT was selected into the DEBI program. (For more
details, see www.effectiveinterventions.org/en/home.aspx .)
ETR Associates was selected to serve as the implementing partner for the DEBI roll-out.
(As noted above, ETR had also been our partner for the roll out of FOY as one of the Programs
that Work discussed earlier.) The packaging of the program included reﬁ lming the ImPACT video
as it was felt to be somewhat local in nature and the creation of program worksheets for the
students to facilitate intervention implementation for the trainers. Prepared by professional trai-
ners and approved by researchers, a speci ﬁc curriculum manual was produced to teach the trainers
how to implement the curriculum. Training sessions (“ institutes ”) were scheduled to provide
direct training to future trainers of trainers and regional, state and local trainings were providedto diffuse the intervention throughout the USA. Researcher involvement was encouraged (and
we did participate) in the train-the-trainer sessions which included intensive skill-buildingaround the intervention, the establishment relationships between the trainers and his/her coach
and speci ﬁc implementation plans. A variety of trainer support mechanisms were offered to the
trainers for use after the training session was over including online training (primary or second-
ary), satellite broadcasts, list serves, newsletters, follow-up calls, etc. This experience underscored
the importance of an active partnership with excellent communication at all stages among
researchers, agencies concerned with public health (such as the CDC), the implementingpartner (such as ETR) and the actual implementers (the trainers). Implementation of an effective
intervention requires multidisciplinary effort among community change agents, curriculum
writers, trainers, those providing backup to the trainers, the researchers and agency administrators(Dolcini et al., 2010 ; Stanton et al., 2007 ).
Intervention implementation research: the new frontier
These efforts culminated in our current exploration, an implementation phase. HIV continues to
impact LMIC nations as well as ﬁnancially and socially stressed populations within industrialized
nations. There is no question that behavioral interventions –and several very powerful biomedical
interventions –can dramatically reduce the transmission of HIV and the impact of HIV infection
on an individual. However, we and others interested in implementing effective interventions have
come to realize several other realities. First, adaptation of interventions as they are implementedby different trainers and/or in different sites is inevitable. Adaptation is also necessary as we
learned each time we sought to implement FOY in a new setting. What we do not know is:242 B. Stanton and X. Li
How much adaptation is too much? Are there “Core Elements ”or components of an intervention
that cannot be eliminated or altered? (Stanton et al., 2011 )
It is equally clear that the resources invested to maintain interventions at an effective level using
external reinforcements are beyond the ﬁnancial resources of most communities and certainly
LMIC communities. Therefore, we must learn more about the factors that allow an intervention
to survive and thrive and selectively target these critical factors. This is the heart of implementation
research and represents our current research focus, whose research platform is in The Bahamas with
their national implementation of FOYC throughout all government grade 6 Bahamian classrooms.
Our current effort is based on the principles of implementation science and seeks to further
develop this ﬁeld of science. Implementation science is primarily concerned with the process of
delivery and how this process impacts anticipated outcomes based on prior effectiveness research
(Dearing, 2009 ). In our ongoing research in the Bahamas, the Ministries of Education and of
Health are hopeful that the nationally implemented FOYC plus CImPACT program will remain
as effective in increasing student knowledge and protective skills, increasing protective perceptions
and intentions and increasing condom use as it was during the effectiveness trial (Chen et al., 2010 ;
Stanton, Chen, et al., 2012 ). National implementation of an evidence-based behavioral intervention
offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the emerging ﬁeld of behavioral implementation science
(McKleroy et al., 2006 ; Rogers, 2010 ).Fidelity of behavioral implementation refers to the degree to
which program implementers ( “trainers ”who in The Bahamas are the grade 6 teachers) actually do
implement the program (e.g. do teach FOYC) and implement it as intended by the program devel-oper (Dearing, 2009 ); in the present case, the developers of FOYC intended that all 10 sessions of
the FOYC curriculum be taught, including all components of activities in each session. However, a
robust literature regarding implementation of education and behavioral interventions con ﬁrms what
we have stated earlier in this section: some degree of alteration is unavoidable (Bellg et al., 2004 ;
Dusenbury, Brannigan, Falco, & Lake, 2004 ; Ringwalt, Vincus, Ennett, Johnson, & Rohrbach,
2004 ; Rohrbach, Ringwalt, Ennett, & Vincus, 2005 ). At the same time, there is a small but compel-
ling literature that the closer intervention delivery is to that shown to be effective, the closer theoutcomes will be. A particularly comprehensive examination of ﬁdelity and effectiveness assessing
seven nationally disseminated education and criminal justice projects found that implementations
conducted with high- ﬁdelity (few changes) were more effective than low- ﬁdelity (many changes)
implementations (Blakely et al., 1987 ). They also observed that local additions to the model
appeared to increase effectiveness or were unrelated to effectiveness.
To enable trainers of a curriculum in a new setting to make some adaptations without impair-
ing the effectiveness of the intervention, the DEBI program has worked with researchers to expli-
citly identify what they believe are the Core Elements or critical characteristics of the original
(effective) intervention without which it is questionable whether the intervention would retainits effectiveness (McKleroy et al., 2006 ). Core Elements can be considered in two categories:
Implementation-Pedagogy (characteristics relating to the logistics of establishing a positive learn-
ing environment and the teaching process used); and Content (the information, skills, values, etc.
that are being taught). Each of these components is considered critical in diffusion/adaptation ofinterventions. At the time that the CDC had accepted FOY with ImPACT into the DEBI program,
we were working with researchers in The Bahamas to adapt the intervention for grade 6 students
in the largest of the Bahamian island, New Providence. To identify the Core Elements of FOYwith ImPACT, we used the three-step process suggested by Kelly et al. (2000 ): (1) examine
the behavioral science theory; (2) use the experience and feedback from participants and experi-enced program staff about what activities were most effective and (3) derive insights from con-trolled experiments of the intervention. Identifying the Core Elements of FOY with ImPACT
involved the developers, the CDC and the DEBI implementers and occurred over many
months. (See Table 1 for
Core Elements of FOY with ImPACT.) Therefore, in the adaptationHealth Psychology & Behavioral Medicine 243

Implementation Core Elements: FOY
Core Element 1 : Deliver intervention to youth in community-based settings
Core Element 2 : Use two skilled facilitators to model communication, negotiation and refusal skills for the
youth
Core Element 3 : Use “friendship” or venue-based groups (i.e. a basketball team, a scout troop, church
group, an existing youth group) to strengthen peer support
Content Core Elements: FOY
Core Element 4 : Use culturally appropriate interactive activities proven as effective learning strategies to
help youth capture the important constructs in the theoryCore Element 5 : Include a “family tree ”to contextualize and personalize abstract concepts, such as
decision-making and risk assessmentCore Element 6: Enable participants to learn and practice a decision-making model such as SODA (Stop,
Options, Decide, Action)
Core Element 7 : Train participants in assertive communication and refusal skills speci ﬁcally related to
negotiation of abstinence or safer sex behaviorsCore Element 8 : Teach youth proper condom-use skills
Implementation Core Elements: ImPACT
Core Element 1 : Delivering intervention one-on-one to parents/guardians and youth in community-based
setting or home at a time and place that is convenient for parent/guardian
Core Element 2 : Use of a facilitator whom the parents/guardians ﬁnd credible. Facilitator should be skilled
at building rapport with parent and youth at the beginning of the sessionCore Element 3 :ImPACT should be delivered prior to or soon after the youth begin the FOY intervention
Pedagogy Core Elements
Core Element 4 : Use the Protect Your Child from AIDS video that shows the challenges and importance of
parents talking to their children about sex, abstinence, STDs, etc.
Core Element 5 : Facilitator must sit down and watch the video with the parent/guardian and youth. Youth
and parent/guardian must watch the video together
Content Core Elements
Core Element 6 : Enabling parent and youth to learn and practice communication skills
Core Element 7 : Teaching parent/guardian and youth proper condom-use skills
Core Element 8 : Distributing and guiding parent/guardian and youth through a Resource Guide that
includes the following topics:
Basic components of good communication and how to talk to your youth
Importance of parental monitoring
Steps for proper condom use
STD and HIV facts, including prevalence data among young African-Americans
Video/DVD Key Messages(1)It is important to talk to your youth about sex before they start having sex
Best time to in ﬂuence is before youth start having sex
Find a good time for you (parent/guardian) and youth
You cannot wait for them to ask about sex
Do not wait until he/she is in the situation, because you will not be there!
Parents need to talk with their youth about STDs and pregnancy
(2)Parents should talk to their children about abstinence
Talking to youth about abstinence and making sure to correct the misperception that “everybody ’s doing
it”will allow them to make better sexual decisions
(3)It is important to know whom your youth is with, what he/she is doing and where he/she is
(4)It
is important for youth to know how they would respond if they were in a situation in which they might
be pressured into having sex
(5)There are serious consequences to risky sexual behavior
Although treatment is now available that allows people to live much longer with HIV, there are still manydifﬁculties with being HIV infected
Sex can make it dif ﬁcult for a young person to reach their goals
The decisions youth make when young have an impact on their future
(6)Parents should talk to their youth about proper condom use, making sure they know how to use condoms
(7)Communication goes both ways244 B. Stanton and X. Li
of FOY with ImPACT to the Bahamian version (FOYC plus CImPACT), the US-Bahamian
researchers were careful to adhere to as many of the identi ﬁed Core Elements of both FOY
and ImPACT as considered appropriate in the Bahamian community. Therefore, the Core
Elements for the adapted intervention used in The Bahamas remain very similar to those identi ﬁed
for the original DEBI program.
To advance our understanding of implementation science and to aid the Ministry of Edu-
cation of The Bahamas in their national implementation effort of FOYC, the FOY team and
our Bahamian researcher partners are conducting (1) an evaluation of the ﬁdelity of the
implementation of FOYC plus CImPACT; (2) an assessment of factors potentially in ﬂuencing
ﬁdelity of implementation; (3) a study of the impact of variations in ﬁdelity of implementation
on intervention outcomes and (4) exploring issues in the measurement of ﬁdelity. Fidelity and
factors potentially in ﬂuencing ﬁdelity are being assessed through seven measures of implemen-
tation (structured observations of the teachers by trained observers and teacher self-reports).
The Ministry is administering a curriculum assessment to the students at the beginning andend of grade 6 (pre- and post-curriculum delivery) and again at the end of grades 7 –9 which
assess knowledge, condom-use skills, perceptions, intentions and some self-reported behaviors.The assessment is totally anonymous (no name or student identi ﬁcation number) as the interest
is in curriculum effectiveness, not individual student behavior. These data are being used to
assess whether the curriculum remains as effective and to correlate student impact with ﬁdelity
of implementation.
The project is being implemented over two waves. The ﬁrst wave of national implementation
(2011) involved 35 government primary schools and 110 teachers. The school received assess-
ments from approximately 2500 grade 6 students both prior to and after the teaching of FOYC(Knowles, Kaljee, et al., 2012 ; Knowles, Wang, et al., 2012 ). A summary of our ﬁndings
reveals that teachers taught a mean of 16.3 out of 30 core activities, 24.9 out of 46 total activitiesand 4.4 out of 8 sessions. (The Ministry of Education had rearranged the 10-session FOYC cur-riculum described earlier into 8 sessions; however, the content was not changed.) The strongest
predictor of implementation ﬁdelity was teacher comfort with the FOYC curriculum. Teachers
who did not perceive the FOYC intervention to be important for their students or who had
attended only part of an FOYC training workshop were more likely to change the curriculum.
Increased duration of experience as a teacher (>10 years) was negatively associated with
ﬁdelity of implementation. Teacher ’s perception of the importance of the FOYC intervention
and implementation ﬁdelity had direct positive effects on students ’HIV/AIDS knowledge,Table 1. Continued.
Be approachable. A parent ’s negative reaction to a youth coming to talk can stop future conversations
It is important to listen to your youth
Often youth wants parents to talk to them about sex. It shows them you care
(8)Talking with your youth is dif ﬁcult but it gets easier over time
Both parents and youth often feel awkward about these discussions
Be prepared. Do the best you can do as a parent and for yourself
It is OK to tell your youth you do not know the answer to a question and to ﬁnd out the answer later
(9) Parents and youth are having these dif ﬁcult conversations successfully
(10)If you feel you cannot talk to your youth about sex, it is important to ﬁnd someone else to talk to him/her .
Find someone who shares your values and has a good rapport with your youth so the youth respects and
enjoys talking with this person
(11) Allow youth to grow toward independence, but set guidelines too
Ultimately, youth are going to make their own decisions, but it is parents ’job to give them information
and prepare them as much as possibleHealth Psychology & Behavioral Medicine 245
reproductive health skills, protective intentions and self-ef ﬁcacy. Youth did not appear to bene ﬁt
from FOYC if two or fewer sessions were delivered.
This is an exciting phase for the FOY team as all of the efforts that we and other teams have
invested in intervention development and evaluation is of diminished value if our interventions
are not adapted, sustained and implemented in a manner that retains initial effectiveness.
Ruminations
How does one summarize over two decades of work in a single manuscript? The answer is simple;
one does not; one only scratches the surface. Still, so many lessons have been learned which are
generalizable.
First, parents wherever we have been recognize that they have dif ﬁculty talking with their
children about sex –but desire the skills to be able to do so. And, in each community we have
visited, the youth have been pleased to have these conversations. Parents would endure substan-tial inconveniences to be able to take advantage of the opportunity to gain these skills and/or to
have a guided discussion about these topics with their children.
Second, each community has very different needs, needs which may be dif ﬁcult to imagine
without asking; but regardless of their needs, youth everywhere have questions about sex anddiseases related to sex which they want to discuss. Despite a very high HIV sero-prevalence,
many youth in Namibia had never heard of HIV. By contrast, despite their very young age,most grade 6 students in The Bahamas were well aware of HIV. Even though youth in
Vietnam and China did not engage in sex at an early age, they were very interested in learning
about HIV.
Third, communities desire ownership of the curriculum that they develop; they take pride in
what they have produced. This is of course a good thing and the more involvement of the com-munity in the adaptation of the curriculum, the more likely it is that the community will regard itas“theirs ”. Our failure to substantially involve the community in the development of the West
Virginia version of FOY may in part explain why the intervention was less impactful in thatsetting.
Fourth, at some point, if the process has gone well, the researcher may become accepted by a
community. In our experience, this honor is unlikely to be accompanied by formal declarationsand therefore the investigator may not realize his or her change in status. It is important to besensitive to this acceptance for it is accompanied with substantial privilege and considerable
responsibility. It is not that we actively or consciously sought acceptance. We did not ask to be
accepted; through our actions and interactions, it happened (to one degree or another) in some
settings, but not in others. In retrospect, our work was very much less effective in those commu-
nities in which we were not accepted. But once acceptance has occurred, the researcher must bothbe aware (and appreciative) of the honor and be mindful of the responsibilities that accompany
such acceptance.
Conclusions
During each of these phases we have learned much about risk and protective factors at the level
of the child, family and community; changes in the constellation of these factors across the ado-lescent years; and cultural variations in these factors. We have gained increased understanding of
the roles of parents and how to enhance their protective effects as well as the role of peers and how
to modify their effects. We have learned about the sequencing of interventions across the adoles-cent years. These ﬁndings have real implications and we like to believe that we have made a
difference.246 B. Stanton and X. Li
But what we know is that FOY –and the individuals with whom we have had the joy of col-
laborating across the globe –has profoundly impacted us. Behind every description of the various
phases of the FOY quarter-century history are countless memories and stories –and a wellspring
of gratitude to the hundreds of communities who opened their doors and gave us the gift of
partnership.
