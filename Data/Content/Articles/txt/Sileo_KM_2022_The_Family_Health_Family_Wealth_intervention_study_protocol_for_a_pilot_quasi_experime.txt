Abstract 
Background: Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates globally, but only 30% of women report using an effective 
method of contraception. Community-based, multi-level interventions are needed to help couples in rural Uganda 
overcome barriers to contraceptive use.
Methods: This study will pilot test the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention, a multi-level, community-based 
intervention employing transformative community dialogues, which use facilitated discussion to reshape commu-
nity norms that influence family planning acceptance, to alter individual attitudes and the perception of community 
norms that discourage family planning. Community dialogues are delivered to groups of couples over 4 sessions (two 
gender-segregated and two gender-mixed). Sessions simultaneously address individual and interpersonal-level deter -
minants of family planning and link couples to family planning services. At the health system level, a refresher training 
will be conducted with health workers in the intervention community’s health center to address gaps in contracep -
tive knowledge and skills as identified from a needs assessment.
The intervention will be evaluated through a pilot quasi-experimental trial paired with a mixed methods process 
evaluation. Participants include 70 couples (N=140) randomized by community to the Family Health = Family Wealth 
intervention (n=35 couples) or to an attention-matched water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) intervention (n=35 
couples). Participants include sexually active, married couples who are age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 40 for 
women and age 18 (or an emancipated minor) to 50 for men, not pregnant, at least one person in the couple reports 
wanting to avoid pregnancy for at least a year, and not currently using a method of contraception or using a low-
efficacy or ineffective method of contraception. The primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the feasibility of the

intervention trial procedures, (2) the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention content and structure, and (3) 
explore the intervention’s preliminary effectiveness at increasing contraceptive use and affecting related outcomes 
among couples.
Discussion: Filling the unmet need for family planning has important public health implications, including reduc-
tions in pregnancy-related health risks and deaths, and infant mortality. This pilot intervention trial will gather prelimi-
nary evidence on the acceptability, feasibility, and potential effect of a novel, multi-level, community-based interven-
tion to increase contraceptive use among couples with an unmet need for family planning in rural Uganda. We aim 
to use the findings of this pilot study to refine the trial procedures and intervention content for a future, larger cluster 
randomized controlled trial to establish the intervention’s efficacy.

Background
Family planning through modern contraceptive methods 
has significant health benefits for women and children, 
including the prevention of pregnancy-related health 
risks and deaths, reductions in infant mortality and 
the rate of unsafe abortions, and the prevention of HIV 
transmission from mother-to-child and between partners 
(when condoms are used) [1]. Uganda made an ambi -
tious commitment to the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) 
initiative to reduce the nation’s unmet need for family 
planning to 10% by 2020 and recommitted to this goal 
for 2030 (FP2030) [2]. However, in 2020, the country was 
far from meeting this goal; 30.5% of married women had 
an unmet need for modern contraceptives [3]. Moreover, 
41% of all pregnancies are unplanned [4], and Uganda 
had the seventh highest fertility rate in the world in 2021 
at 5.45 children per woman [5], which is especially high 
in rural areas [4]. With a maternal mortality rate of 375 
deaths per 100,000 live births compared to 19 deaths per 
100,000 live births in the USA [6], it is estimated that if all 
women in need of contraceptives in Uganda were using 
them, maternal deaths could be reduced by 40% [7].
Uganda’s FP02030 efforts must be paired with inter -
ventions that generate demand for such services to opti -
mize their reach. Misinformation and fear of side-effects 
[8–11], partner and peer influence [12–14], and cultural 
norms that promote large family size and traditional 
gender roles [15–18] negatively influence contraceptive 
use, and shape inequity in reproductive decision-making 
and communication between partners [19, 20]. How -
ever, despite numerous calls for multilevel interventions 
to address family planning needs, few interventions have 
incorporated this approach [21].
Community dialogues are a promising strategy to pro -
mote change at the individual, interpersonal, and com -
munity level [22]. Community dialogues follow a defined 
process to identify local drivers of sexual and reproduc -
tive health with community groups [22] and engage the 
community in problem-solving towards a common issue through community-based participatory methodologies 
[23]. The dialogue that takes place allows community 
members to critically think about social norms underpin -
ning a community problem [24] and reconstruct commu -
nity norms together, creating social environments that 
promote healthy behavior [25]. For reproductive health, 
community dialogues have been widely used by multina -
tional agencies [22], but not rigorously tested and rarely 
published in peer-reviewed literature [26]. Successful 
examples demonstrate improvements in equitable rela -
tionships, community gender norms, and community 
ownership of a problem, but mainly focus on HIV and 
rely on qualitative methods [23, 27–34]. Thus, there is a 
gap of rigorous evaluations of community dialogues to 
support their effect on behavioral and health outcomes.
Community dialogues may be optimized when linked 
with other multi-level approaches [22], which may be 
needed to engage men and address relationship and com -
munity drivers of family planning. Emerging literature 
demonstrates interventions that engage male partners 
are more effective than those that do not [35, 36], but 
reviews of male engagement strategies conclude that evi -
dence is still accumulating [37–40]. The following multi-
level strategies have gained support, but are in need of 
further evaluation: tailoring messaging to men’s interests 
(e.g., economic benefits of family planning), improving 
partner communication and gender equitable attitudes, 
bringing services directly to communities, and demon -
strating family planning support from community leaders 
and other men [19, 29, 38, 41–44].
This paper describes the protocol for the “Family 
Health = Family Wealth” pilot intervention, a multi-level, 
community-based intervention that engages groups of 
couples in transformative community dialogues, while 
addressing other multi-level barriers to contraceptive 
use, to increase contraceptive uptake/continuation and 
reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy through 
improved intermediate outcomes (knowledge, attitudes, 
perceived community norms, communication, equity).

Based on our preliminary research [45–47], the Family 
Health = Family Wealth intervention frames contracep -
tive use as one aspect of “family wealth” and emphasizes 
family planning’s economic and other family benefits. 
We test the acceptability, feasibility, and the preliminary 
effect of this intervention through a stage 1b pilot (i.e., 
feasibility and pilot testing of new behavioral interven -
tions) quasi experimental trial with 70 couples. Following 
stage 1b pilot study guidelines [48, 49], the primary aims 
of our pilot trial are to assess acceptability and feasibility 
of the trial procedures and intervention content/struc -
ture, with the exploratory aim of assessing the interven -
tion’s potential efficacy, detailed in the specific aims:
1. Assess the feasibility of trial procedures (i.e., commu -
nity mobilization, recruitment, retention, outcome 
measurement) through the collection of process data 
and exit interviews with couples and group facilita -
tors.
2. Assess the acceptability and feasibility of the Family 
Health = Family Wealth intervention content and 
structure through the collection of process data and 
exit interviews with couples and group facilitators.
3. Explore the potential effect of the Family Health = 
Family Wealth intervention on exploratory primary 
outcomes of contraceptive uptake and continuation 
and exploratory secondary outcomes (pregnancy 
incidence, knowledge, attitudes, perceived com -
munity norms, partner communication, and equity) 
among couples in the intervention community (rela -
tive to the attention-matched comparator commu -
nity) through 6 months follow-up.
Methods
Setting
The study will be conducted in selected communities in 
a district in central  Uganda, which is located 2 h from 
the capital of Kampala and has a population of approxi -
mately  150,000 in an area of approximately 270  mi2. 
Family planning services are provided for free at decen -
tralized government public health facilities, integrated 
into general outpatient services. Local private not-for-
profits (PNFPs) provided limited family planning ser -
vices, while faith-based PNFP facilities promote natural 
methods only. In addition, some short-term methods can 
be purchased at local private shops. Within the district, 
government public health facilities range across five lev -
els (I-IV) following the country’s decentralized health 
system structure. Health center IIs and above offer con -
doms, oral pills, and injectable contraceptives. Health 
center IIIs and above offer intrauterine devices (IUDs) 
and implants. Health center vs (general hospital) provide non-reversible methods (vasectomy, tubal ligation). The 
Village Health Team (VHT), a cadre of community health 
workers, serve as a liaison between the community and 
health facilities, and support community family planning 
efforts. VHTs provide community education about fam -
ily planning and distribute short-term methods directly 
in the community (i.e., condoms, oral pills). In addition, 
an international nongovernmental organization, Marie 
Stopes, provides regular community outreach for contra -
ceptive methods in selected villages within the district, 
including the provision of short- and long-term revers -
ible methods.
Study design
The study design is a pilot quasi-experimental controlled 
trial paired with a mixed methods process evaluation. 
The pilot quasi-experimental trial includes one com -
munity receiving the Family Health = Family Health 
intervention and one community receiving a time- 
and attention-matched water, sanitation, and hygiene 
(WASH) comparator intervention. The two communities 
selected in consultation with the District Health Team 
will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention or 
the comparator intervention, determined by coin toss. 
Seventy couples (N=140, 35 couples per community) 
will be recruited. We will conduct structured interviews 
at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 3- and 6-month 
follow-up.
In addition, mixed method data will be collected both 
during and after the trial to assess the acceptability and 
feasibility of the trial procedures and intervention con -
tent. Process data will be collected throughout the trial 
on community mobilization, participant retention, and 
other trial procedures. Brief, semi-structured interviews 
will be conducted with intervention and comparator 
participants during the trial immediately following each 
intervention session (N=140). Intervention fidelity will 
be monitored through direct observation of intervention 
sessions. Post-intervention, semi-structured exit inter -
views will be conducted with intervention participants 
(N=70), as well as individuals involved in the implemen -
tation of the intervention (i.e., group facilitators, health 
workers, community leaders). See Fig.  1 for the study 
design depicted in the CONSORT diagram, adapted for 
feasibility and pilot studies.
Study population
The study population is adult couples, women aged 18 (or 
emancipated minors) to 40 and men aged 18 (or emanci -
pated minors) to 50, residing in communities selected for 
inclusion in the study. The Ugandan National Council for 
Science and Technology defines emancipated minors as 
those under 18 who are married, having children, or are 
Page 4 of 14 Sileo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:265 
pregnant. Couples with an unmet need for family plan -
ning are the focus of the study, i.e., couples of reproduc -
tive age in which at least one person in the couple does 
not want to become pregnant within the next year but are 
not currently using modern contraceptives.Sampling and randomization
Two communities will be selected in partnership with 
the District Health Team. These communities will be 
matched by population (~2000), distance to a clinic with 
contraceptives, and demographics, randomly assigning Fig. 1 Consort diagram
Page 5 of 14
 Sileo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:265 
 
one to receive the intervention and one as the compara -
tor, determined by coin toss. If needed, the recruitment 
could expand to include nearby communities within the 
same geographic area. Communities will be at least 15 
km in distance from one another and not located along 
the same road to avoid potential contamination. Snow -
ball sampling will also be used to identify couples living 
within the sampled communities. Leveraging existing 
social networks through snowball sampling may enhance 
our intervention’s effect on social norms, as family, peers, 
and neighbors more directly affect contraceptive deci -
sions than strangers.
Procedures
Eligibility, recruitment, and informed consent procedures
After we randomly allocate the communities to the inter -
vention and comparator arm, we will recruit couples with 
an unmet need for family planning from the selected 
communities for participation in our intervention trial. 
Thirty-five couples (70 individuals; 35 women, 35 men) 
will be recruited from each community (intervention and 
comparator intervention). In each community, VHTs will 
assist our research staff in identifying potentially eligible 
couples. For the couples that we attempt to recruit based 
on the VHT’s referral, the VHT will first independently 
visit couples’ homes to introduce them to the study and 
gain permission to return with the research assistant. 
VHTs will be blinded to the study’s purpose and will 
not participate in the screening of participant eligibil -
ity. If permission is granted, the VHT will accompany 
our research assistant to couples’ homes to introduce 
our research assistant and then leave the house. Partici -
pants in both conditions will receive the same recruit -
ment script and consent form. Research assistants and 
participants in both conditions will be told that the 
study is focused on family health and wellness, with the intervention program including a range of topics affect -
ing family wellness such as health, healthy relationship, 
water and sanitation hygiene, family planning, and eco -
nomic wellness, with the content they receive chosen 
through random selection. This serves to blind partici -
pants and research assistants to the purpose of the inter -
vention and reduce selection bias.
If both partners are together during this initial meet -
ing, the research assistant will inform them of the overall 
study together, but will screen and assess eligibility sepa -
rately, ensuring that participants are able to answer the 
eligibility screening questions about fertility preferences 
and current use of contraceptives in a private setting to 
ensure confidentiality. If only one partner is present, the 
research assistant will proceed with the eligibility screen -
ing and conduct the screening and all subsequent steps 
at a later date. See Table  1 for a summary for the eligibil -
ity criteria. No identifying information will be collected 
for eligibility screening. If eligible and interested, the 
research assistant will then obtain written informed con -
sent from the participants. The interviewer will proceed 
to conduct the baseline interview after obtaining written 
informed consent for both partners.
If an eligible participant is interested, but their part -
ner declines participation, the research assistant will 
not proceed to recruit them in the study. However, they 
will provide a referral to local health services, including 
family planning services, for a nearby clinic to the inter -
ested participant (in both the intervention and compara -
tor communities to maintain balance between the study 
arms).
After we successfully enroll the first few couples that 
meet eligibility criteria and consent to participation, we 
will then use snowball sampling to identify the next cou -
ple. That is, we will ask participants to refer another cou -
ple they know that lives within the sampled community

of similar age that might also be interested in participat -
ing. The participating couple will be asked to refer their 
friends to our research staff or to the VHT, providing our 
contact information. We will wait for new couples to ini -
tiate contact with our study team and provide permission 
for our research assistant to visit their home before doing 
so. If we reach the end of a network, or if any couple is 
not able/willing to refer another couple, we will return 
to the VHT to identify a new couple, from which we will 
continue our snowball sampling procedures.
Description of the study arms
Comparison arm: water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) 
intervention
Participants in the comparison arm will receive an atten -
tion-matched comparator intervention, including four 
community dialogue sessions focused on water, sanita -
tion, and hygiene (WASH) led by a trained facilitator. 
The content will include directive education, open dia -
logue, and group problem-solving using an adapted ver -
sion of an existing curriculum developed for community 
health workers in Ethiopia with support from USAID 
and the Water and Sanitation Program [50]. The focus of 
the content is community-led total sanitation, a widely 
adopted approach to WASH behavior change, focusing 
on an array of WASH behaviors (i.e., clean water, hand-
washing, latrine use, personal and home hygiene, safe 
food preparation). Following the structure of our family 
planning intervention, comparator sessions will include 
two gender-segregated and two gender-mixed sessions 
delivered to groups of couples. We will also tailor the intervention to the local Ugandan context, guided by the 
study’s investigators from Uganda and with input from 
local VHTs and midwives. This intervention was chosen 
as a comparator because it was similar in time and struc -
ture (e.g., delivered in community groups by a trained 
facilitator) to the planned intervention, making it easy 
adaptable to be time and attention-matched. The topic 
of WASH was selected based on consultation with local 
stakeholders and community members, who gave feed -
back that the content would be of interest and deemed 
culturally appropriate to community members, which we 
considered important for retention purposes, without the 
content overlapping with family planning.
Family Health = Family Wealth intervention arm (see Table 2)
Before the implementation of the couples’ intervention, 
a needs assessment will be conducted at the local clinics 
to identify gaps in health worker capacity specific to the 
provision of contraceptive methods and family planning 
education. In partnership with the District Health Team, 
a targeted refresher training will be conducted with 
health workers in the intervention community’s health 
center to address gaps in knowledge and skills.
Participants in the intervention community will receive 
the Family Health = Family Wealth intervention con -
sisting of four sessions: two gender-segregated and two 
gender-mixed. The intervention content was informed 
by preliminary research with women and men from the 
same study area [45–47], and a more recent qualitative 
needs assessment conducted as the precursor to this pilot 
trial that identified individual, interpersonal, community,

and health system-level drivers of contraceptive use, 
guided by the social ecological model [51–53]. Each of 
the 4 sessions include community dialogues, which are 
grounded in Campbell and Cornish’s social psychologi -
cal theory of transformative communication [54], the 
primary mechanism of action to affect change across the 
individual, interpersonal, and community levels, spe -
cifically through change in individual attitudes, interper -
sonal communication, and the perception of community 
norms related to family planning acceptance and gender 
equity. Our facilitated discussions will focus on commu -
nity norms around gender roles, equity, and family size 
and critically analyze the social and community influ -
ences of “family-wealth” and poverty with the overall goal 
of reconstructing individual attitudes and group norms 
on paths to/definitions of a “successful family” inclusive 
of family planning.
Dialogues are enhanced in sessions 2 and 3 to address 
knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy, and relationship 
dynamics, tailored to men and women. Based on our 
preliminary research on gender-specific family planning 
facilitators [45–47], the overarching theme of each ses -
sion is “Family Health = Family Wealth. ” We conceptu -
alize “family wealth” as being made up of relationship, 
economic, and physical well-being and deliver content 
to demonstrate how family planning contributes to fam -
ily health and wealth in each area. The inclusion of com -
munity leaders to endorse behavior change in group 
dialogues can increase success of transformative com -
munication and facilitate the allocation of local resources 
to implement group-generated action plans [22, 31, 33]. 
Therefore, we will select and train both female and male 
community leaders to endorse family planning at the 
community-level at the beginning and end of the pro -
gram, involve local business experts to engage men and 
women in economic skills training, and involve midwives 
and VHTs directly in program delivery. It is common in 
community dialogues for the group to work together to 
develop a “Community Action Plan” to elicit commu -
nity-derived solutions that utilize existing resources and 
increase community ownership of these solutions [26]. 
We adapt this concept into “Family Action Plans” for 
couples in session 3 and introduce “Community Action 
Plans” in session 4. At the end of sessions 3 and 4, par -
ticipants will have the opportunity to receive short-term 
contraceptive methods directly, or referrals for long-term 
methods, and family planning couples counseling from a 
midwife and/or VHT.
Data collection procedures and measures
Feasibility aim 1 (trial procedures)
We will develop process monitoring data collection 
tools to capture process data on the feasibility of trial procedures, or the extent to which these procedures can 
be successfully carried out in this setting [55], specific to 
community mobilization, recruitment, retention, and the 
assessment process, which will be triangulated/explained 
with qualitative exit interviews and direct observation 
when appropriate. All intervention sessions will be audio-
recorded and a randomly selected portion (~20%) of the 
dialogues transcribed and analyzed for fidelity following 
a constructed checklist. The measurement of specific 
outcomes is detailed below:
• Community mobilization: Percent of households that 
accepted the invitation to learn more about the study 
and collected through process data/study records.
• Recruitment: Number of couples enrolled per month 
and the percent of eligible couples where one partner 
declined, and reasons for decline by gender, collected 
through process data/study records.
• Retention: Treatment-specific retention rates through 
6-month follow-up and reason for drop-out by gen -
der, collected through observation and exit inter -
views with participants.
• Assessment process: Percent of planned assessments 
completed and duration of assessments collected 
through process data collection; barriers to preg -
nancy testing and the delivery of pregnancy test 
results gathered through exit interviews with partici -
pants and research staff.
• Fidelity: Degree to which intervention was imple -
mented as prescribed in the protocol, measured 
through fidelity check-lists completed by interven -
tion facilitators, direct observation by research staff, 
and the audio-recording and analysis of randomly 
selected sessions (as previously described).
Feasibility/acceptability aim 2 (intervention content/
structure)
After each intervention and comparator session, all indi -
viduals will complete a brief semi-structured interview 
(~5 min) to assess acceptability of the intervention con -
tent and structure, rating perceived importance and sat -
isfaction with intervention content, and an open-ended 
question on what they liked and disliked. These brief 
semi-structured interviews will also include questions to 
assess any unanticipated negative adverse events occur -
ring because of the intervention (e.g., partner conflict). 
Interviews will be conducted immediately following each 
intervention session by the intervention facilitators and 
by one of the study’s Primary Investigators.
After all intervention sessions are completed, semi-
structured exit interviews (~15 min) will be conducted 
with intervention participants (n=70). These interviews 
Page 8 of 14 Sileo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:265 
will be conducted by a trained qualitative interviewer, 
not otherwise involved in the intervention delivery or 
outcome assessment, within a 3-week participant com -
pletion of the last intervention session. They will be con -
ducted over the phone or in-person at a place convenient 
to the participant. The aim of the exit interviews is to 
further assess acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, 
areas for improvement, and progress on “Family Action 
Plans” among participants.
After the completion of the intervention sessions, 
semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with 
individuals involved in intervention implementation 
include the trained group discussion leaders (n =2), 
health workers, and VHTs that will deliver family plan -
ning education and contraceptive methods (n ~2), and 
trained community leaders and local business experts 
that will co-facilitate discussions (n ~2–4). The aim of 
the exit interviews with intervention facilitators is to 
assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention 
and involvement in community leaders/health work -
ers in the intervention, barriers to implementation, 
and areas for improvement from the perspectives of 
the facilitators. Exit interviews will be conducted in-
person or over the phone within the 6 months follow -
ing the completion of the last intervention session by 
a third-party, trained qualitative interviewer or one of 
the study’s Primary Investigators.
The measurement of the primary outcomes for the fea -
sibility/acceptability of the intervention gathered from 
these data are detailed as follows:
• Feasibility : Whether the intervention can be carried 
out and utilized, and if it can linked to family plan -
ning services, including whether contraceptives can 
be distributed directly during sessions, collected 
through observation and exit interviews with par -
ticipants and individuals involved in the implementa -
tion of the intervention (i.e., group facilitators, health 
workers, community leaders) [55]
• Acceptability: Satisfaction with the intervention, col -
lected through brief semi-structured intervention 
after each intervention session and post-intervention 
exit interviews with participants [55]
• Perceived fit: Appropriateness for setting and to 
improve care quality and patient outcomes, collected 
through observation and exit interviews with par -
ticipants and individuals involved in the implementa -
tion of the intervention (i.e., group facilitators, health 
workers, community leaders) [55]
• Perceived barriers: Perceived difficulty of and barriers 
to implementation and utilization collected through 
observation, brief semi-structured intervention after 
each intervention session, and exit interviews with participants and individuals involved in the imple -
mentation of the intervention (i.e., group facilitators, 
health workers, community leaders)
Exploratory aim 3 (intervention effect)
At baseline, immediately following enrollment, and at 3- 
and 6-month follow-up, research assistants will collect 
demographic information (baseline only) and measures 
to assess family planning determinants in a one-on-one 
interview. Data will be collected using a computerized 
structured questionnaire. All couples will be interviewed 
separately; the interview will take place in a private set -
ting within the participant’s home, another agreed upon 
location, or over the phone if necessary. At baseline and 
6 months, research assistants will also collect pregnancy 
test results from women, following a urine Human Cho -
rionic Gonadotropin rapid pregnancy test. Finally, at 3- 
and 6-month follow-up, research assistants will go to the 
local health facility to extract data from medical charts 
on participants’ use of contraceptive methods in the 
prior 3 months to triangulate self-report. Pregnancy test 
results and clinic record data will be double entered into 
an electronic data collection form.
While this pilot trial is not powered to detect statisti -
cally significant changes in all of these outcomes, the col -
lection of the full set of exploratory outcomes helps to 
achieve aim 2, the pilot testing of intervention trial pro -
cedures, including the development of data collection 
tools, procedures, and data on their feasibility. For exam -
ple, piloting the administration of pregnancy tests and 
procedures for delivering the results to couples will allow 
us to gather information to inform procedures appropri -
ate for the local context.
The outcomes, how they are measured/collected, and 
timeframes of collection are displayed in Table 3.
Sample size justification
As an exploratory pilot, we base our sample size for 
our quasi-experimental controlled trial on guidelines 
for Stage 1b studies (feasibility and pilot testing of new 
behavioral interventions), which suggest 15–30 partici -
pants per cell [49], choosing 35 couples per condition 
(n=70 individuals per condition). Even assuming moder -
ate attrition (20%), we would have 28 couples per condi -
tion, which is still within the guidelines for pilot studies.
Data analysis approach
Quantitative process data and data collected from brief 
semi-structured questionnaires intervention session will 
be analyzed using frequencies and descriptive statistics 
Page 9 of 14
 Sileo et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:265 
 
(e.g., counts, percents, means and standard deviations, or 
medians and inter-quartile ranges).
Qualitative data collected through exit interviews will 
be audio-recorded, translated, transcribed, and analyzed 
using a thematic analysis approach [64]. The investiga -
tive team will review the transcripts to identify poten -
tial themes and develop a coding scheme guided by the 
constructs outlined in Table  3. Two trained research 
assistants will independently code the data, which will 
be reviewed by the Primary Investigators. The team will 
review codes for consistency, refine the coding scheme 
as needed, and identify major themes, repeating this 
process until consensus is reached. Following Creswell 
and Plano-Clark, qualitative findings will be mixed with 
quantitative process data as appropriate during the pres -
entation and interpretation of results [65].
As a pilot intervention trial, the study’s exploratory 
aim to gather preliminary effects of the intervention 
on family planning outcomes will be achieved through 
mainly descriptive analyses. Using SPSS v.28, we will use frequencies to examine the total uptake of contraceptives 
(using an effective method, yes vs. no) in the interven -
tion and comparator arms and will use frequencies and 
descriptive statistics and measures of variance to describe 
the study’s exploratory secondary outcomes across the 
two study arms. We will look at the percent difference 
between contraceptive uptake between the two arms and 
use the magnitude of the difference (if present).
Progression criteria
Progression criteria to help determine the next step 
beyond this pilot trial are detailed in Table  4. Follow -
ing Thabane et  al. ’s recommendations [66], the pro -
gression criteria will be used to determine whether 
the next step is progression to a larger, fully powered 
cluster randomized controlled trial without modifica -
tion to the protocol, progression without modifications 
but with close monitoring, progression with modifica -
tions, or no progression if deemed not feasible/accept -
able even after modifications. The progression criteria Table 3 Exploratory primary outcome measures used to pilot the acceptability and feasibility of measurement tools and procedures,

Exploratory primary outcome measures Data collection procedures/measures Time frame
Modern contraceptive use/continuation Self-reported measures for current contraceptive use are adapted 
from Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) measures 
[4]. Defined as the usage of pills, injection, condoms (self-report, 
≥90% of sex acts), IUD, implant, tubal ligation, vasectomy, meas-
ured through women’s clinic records (men’s for vasectomy) and 
triangulated with self-report [56, 57]3 and 6 months
Exploratory secondary outcome measures Data collection procedures/measures Time frame

Ethics
The study has obtained approval of all study procedures 
from the institutional review boards at the University 
of Texas at San Antonio (protocol # 19-253) and the 
Makerere University School of Public Health (protocol 
# 748). The Ugandan National Council for Science and 
Technology has also granted study approval. Mobiliza -
tion meetings were also conducted to garner district 
buy-in, and entry into the communities was permitted 
by district leadership. We will obtain written informed 
consent for participation in the pilot intervention trial 
from each person in the couple separately. We will also 
obtain written informed consent for participation in 
exit interviews from all individuals involved in inter -
vention implementation (i.e., group facilitators, health 
workers, VHTs, community leaders). In addition, a data 
safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be assembled to 
provide third party review of the study protocol before 
implementation, and review data related to participant 
safety every 3 months throughout the duration of data 
collection activities. We expect that the overall risk to 
benefit ratio will be favorable to individuals participat -
ing in the study. The main potential risks of the study 
are summarized in Table  5, with details on strategies 
that will be employed to minimize each risk.Discussion
This protocol describes the pilot implementation and 
evaluation of a multi-level, community-based family 
planning intervention for couples in rural Uganda. Cou -
ples receiving the Family Health = Family Wealth inter -
vention will participate in multiple group sessions (2 
gender-segregated, 2 gender-mixed) aimed to address 
multi-level barriers to contraceptive use, including com -
munity dialogues with groups of couples to reconstruct 
group norms enhanced with activities to improve knowl -
edge, motivation, couple dynamics, and link couples 
to services. The intervention also aims to reduce health 
system barriers to contraceptive use through targeted 
capacity building for family planning through the train -
ing of healthcare workers in the intervention commu -
nity and through the direct distribution of short-term 
contraceptive methods during group sessions. This pilot 
study will indicate if the trial procedures and interven -
tion content are acceptable and feasible and provide pre -
liminary evidence of whether couples in Family Health = 
Family Wealth intervention show trends towards greater 
contraceptive uptake/continuation and improvement in 
intermediate outcomes (knowledge, attitudes, perceived 
norms, partner communication, equity) at 6 months 
compared to couples receiving a time- and attention-
match WASH comparator intervention.
This pilot intervention study has the potential to 
advance science and improve public health service deliv -
ery in several ways. This study will fill several gaps in the 
family planning intervention literature, where there is a 
lack of rigorously tested family planning interventions 
that take a multi-level approach, few interventions that 
show effects beyond knowledge and attitudes (i.e., on Table 4 Progression criteria for the Family Health = Family Wealth pilot intervention

contraceptive use and pregnancy incidence), and a need 
for more research on strategies to engage male partners 
[21, 36, 67–70]. Those in the intervention arm may ben -
efit from transformative dialogues that shift individual 
and community attitudes towards more gender equita -
ble attitudes and new definitions of a “successful” family 
inclusive of family planning. The intervention can create 
a social environment supportive of family planning and 
gender equity, which may subsequently influence per -
ceived social acceptance of family planning and encour -
age greater use of family planning services. Secondary 
benefits of promoting gender equitable attitudes through 
our intervention may include the potential for reductions 
in intimate partner violence, improvements in wom -
en’s empowerment in relationships and in the broader 
community through participation in interactive group 
forums, and greater engagement among men in family 
planning and health services more generally.
Importantly, family planning through modern con -
traceptive methods has significant health benefits for 
women and children [1]. Family planning also has eco -
nomic benefits for families and for society, especially 
in under-resourced settings. Couples who space and 
limit their pregnancies have more earning potential and families can devote more resources to each child. On a 
population-level, family planning is critical to achiev -
ing the “demographic dividend” in low-income nations, 
a window of economic growth resulting from decreased 
fertility rates and subsequent increases in the proportion 
of working-age people relative to dependent children.
Limitations
We chose to randomize by community, and not by cou -
ple, because intervention components are delivered at 
the community level. As a pilot trial, we can only ran -
domize two communities, which could introduce con -
founding variables given too few clusters. However, 
this pilot can inform the procedures for a larger CRCT 
after acceptability and feasibility are established. To 
reduce confounding variables, we will attempt to match 
intervention and comparator communities  on demo -
graphics. Another potential limitation includes the 
potential for contamination between treatment con -
ditions. This is mitigated by choosing communities at 
least 15 km apart and not along a main road. We will 
blind participants and interviewers to study condition. 
While un-blinding is possible, we will mitigate the risk 
of un-blinding by presenting the overall program as a Table 5 Overview of ethical considerations: potential risks of participation and planned strategies for risk mitigation
Risks Safeguards for risk mitigation
Potential for breaches in confidentiality related to collected data (1) The use of unique identifiers instead of medical identification/record 
numbers or participant names
(2) The storing of the lists that link the participants to their unique identi-
fiers in locked, secure locations
(3) The use password protection for all data collected and/or stored 
electronically
(4) Training all study staff in the importance of and procedures for protect -
ing participants’ confidentiality
Potential to experience discomfort while discussing sensitive infor -
mation during interviewer administered computerized question-
naires and group intervention sessions(1) IRB-approved consent forms to convey that the survey portion of the 
research project and group sessions involve sensitive topics
(2) The ability to skip any questions that makes one uncomfortable and to 
withdraw from the study any time
(3) Training all study staff in the importance of procedures for protecting 
participants’ confidentiality
(4) Training of study staff to approach sensitive topics in a culturally appro -
priate and non-judgmental way
Potential unintended negative consequences on participants in the 
intervention (e.g., conflict between partners)(1) Inform participants of potential risks in the informed consent process 
and discourage participation among individuals who fear participation 
could increase their risk for violence victimization.
(2) Ask participants to inform study staff throughout the study if they feel 
they are experiencing an increased risk of violence so that they can be 
linked to resources and removed from the study if deemed necessary
(3) Monitor increased risk of violence through the post-intervention 
interview
(4) Monitor increased risk of violence through the 3-month and 6-month 
questionnaires
(5) Training of group facilitators to recognize disagreement between 
couples and will provide counseling to couples to minimize discordance, 
and the occurrence of conflict
(6) Training of group facilitators to guide couples’ in selecting action plan 
items that are appropriate for their circumstances

family health and wellness intervention that includes a 
range of topics related to economic health, relationship 
health, and physical health, including both family plan -
ning and WASH topics. Participants and interviewers 
will be told that participants are randomized to receive 
some, all, or none of this content in order to attempt 
to mask that the true goal of the study is to increase 
contraceptive use. Finally, we include pregnancy inci -
dence as an exploratory secondary outcome, informing 
the acceptability of pregnancy testing procedures of a 
future trial. While we have limited power to detect dif -
ferences in pregnancy incidence, trends towards change 
in contraceptive use and related determinants will pro -
vide evidence to support a future, fully powered trial, 
the feasibility of which is strengthened by piloting preg -
nancy testing and other trial procedures.
Conclusion
The pilot trial for the Family Health = Family Wealth 
intervention will provide data on acceptability, feasibility, 
and preliminary effects on contraceptive use and explora -
tory secondary outcomes among couples with an unmet 
need for family planning. If progressed to a future trial, 
this trial will assess the intervention’s effects on contra -
ceptive use, unintended pregnancy, and potentially the 
feasibility of using the intervention as a platform for 
community distribution of contraceptives. Thus, this 
intervention has the potential to be sustained through 
Uganda’s national scale up of community-based family 
planning, which will require the simultaneous implemen -
tation of evidence-based, demand-generation activities to 
increase community acceptance of family planning. This 
intervention also has the potential to be generalizable to 
other African and South East Asian countries, where high 
unmet need for contraceptives is similarly tied to gender 
norms, relationship equity, and community dynamics 
and where community-based health service models are 
utilized [8, 71–73].
