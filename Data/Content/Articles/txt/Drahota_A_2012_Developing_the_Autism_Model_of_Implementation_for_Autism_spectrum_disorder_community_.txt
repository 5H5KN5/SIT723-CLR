Developing the Autism Model of Implementation
for Autism spectrum disorder community
providers: study protocol

Abstract
Background: Currently, 1 out of 88 children are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the
estimated cost for treatment services is $126 billion annually. Typically, ASD community providers (ASD-CPs) provide
services to children with any severity of ASD symptoms using a combination of various treatment paradigms, some
with an evidence-base and some without. When evidence-based practices (EBPs) are successfully implemented by
ASD-CPs, they can result in positive outcomes. Despite this promise, EBPs are often implemented unsuccessfully
and other treatments used by ASD-CPs lack supportive evidence, especially for school-age children with ASD. While
it is not well understood why ASD-CPs are not implementing EBPs, organizational and individual characteristics
likely play a role. As a response to this need and to improve the lives of children with ASD and their families, this
study aims to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the Autism Model of Implementation (AMI) to
support the implementation of EBPs by ASD-CPs.
Methods/design: An academic-community collaboration developed to partner with ASD-CPs will facilitate the
development of the AMI, a process specifically for use by ASD community-based agencies. Using a mixed methods
approach, the project will assess agency and individual factors likely to facilitate or hinder implementing EBPs in
this context; develop the AMI to address identified barriers and facilitators; and pilot test the AMI to examine its
feasibility and acceptability using a specific EBP to treat anxiety disorders in school-age children with ASD.
Discussion: The AMI will represent a data-informed approach to facilitate implementation of EBPs by ASD-CPs by
providing an implementation model specifically developed for this context. This study is designed to address the
real-world implications of EBP implementation in ASD community-based agencies. In doing so, the AMI will help to
provide children with ASD the best and most effective services in their own community. Moreover, the proposed
study will positively impact the field of implementation science by providing an empirically supported and tested
model of implementation to facilitate the identification, adoption, and use of EBPs.

Background
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of pervasive,
clinically complex disorders that require multiple inter-
vention types to alleviate common clinical targets, such
as impaired social skills and communication, executive
functioning, empathy and perspective taking, sensoryperception, and motor skills, along with restricted and
circumscribed interests and co-occurring psychiatric dis-
orders [1]. Currently 1 out of 88 children are diagnosed
with an ASD [2], and treatments for ASD symptoms are
estimated to cost $125 billion annually [3]. Typically,
ASD community providers (ASD-CPs) provide services
to children with any severity of ASD symptoms using a
combination of various treatment paradigms, with some
treatments considered efficacious or probably efficacious
and some with no evidence-base [4-7]. When evidence-
based practices (EBPs) are successfully implemented by* Correspondence: adrahota@casrc.org

ASD-CPs, outcomes include increased IQ, communica-
tion, social and daily living skills, and provide an
improved developmental trajectory for children withASD [8]. Despite this promise, EBPs are often imple-
mented unsuccessfully, and other treatments used by
ASD-CPs lack supportive evidence; both may be incon-sequential at best and harmful, even deadly, to children
with ASD, at worst [9,10]. Given that 25.3% of California
Department of Developmental Services ’total budget
pays for services for individuals with ASD [11], it is crit-
ical that EBPs be successfully implemented by ASD-CPs
to improve the lives of children with ASD and their fam-ilies, and as a measure of fiscal responsibility.
Recently, research emphasis has been placed on devel-
oping and testing EBPs for children with ASD and theirfamilies, resulting in an increase in the number of EBPs
targeting many common clinical targets of the disorder
[2,12]. However, ASD-CPs are not implementing theseEBPs at the same rate that they are being developed and
tested [5]. Instead, ASD-CPs are either delivering a
single type of intervention for all clinical targets
(e.g., Discrete Trial Teaching (DTT)), combining prac-
tices in a non-systematic manner, or using practices that
lack supportive evidence. For example, DTT is a highlystructured EBP that targets ASD symptoms, such as
communication, and has robust evidence supporting its
use. However, it does not fit all children with ASD, inparticular, higher functioning school-age children with
ASD, nor treat many common clinical disorders experi-
enced by children with ASD [6]. Thus, many childrenwith ASD in the community are left with unmet clinical
needs [7].
It is not well understood why ASD-CPs are not imple-
menting EBPs for common clinical issues related to
ASD. It is likely that both organizational and individual
ASD-CP characteristics play a role in hindering imple-mentation. Further, preliminary individual interviews
with a convenience sample of five ASD community
agency leaders (herein referred to as ‘ASD leaders ’) indi-
cated a need for a contextually specific model designed
for use by ASD-CPs to facilitate implementing EBPs for
children with ASD. That is, while EBPs may be available,
ASD-CPs do not have an efficient and effective process
to facilitate EBP adoption, implementation, and sustain-ment. As a response to this need, and to improve the
lives of children with ASD and their families, this study
aims to develop the Autism Model of Implementation(AMI) that will facilitate implementation of EBPs within
ASD community-based agencies.
A contextually specific implementation model for
ASD-CPs is necessary
Current empirically derived implementation models
[13-15] provide useful guidance for the development ofthe AMI given that they consider a comprehensive set
of organizational and individual provider factors likely
to contribute to the adoption and implementation ofEBPs. However, it is not known whether these models can
be generalized to ASD-CPs. Attempting to generalize em-
pirically derived implementation models for other settingsmay fail to recognize the unique context and characteris-
tics of ASD-CPs. For example, compared with other
community-based contexts ( e.g., community mental health
providers), ASD-CPs differ in training, attitudes towards
EBPs, and funding [5,16,17]. Preliminary data gathered for
this study indicate that ASD Leaders are willing to adoptEBPs (after evaluating the EBP-agency fit) but identified
implementation barriers ranging from the educational
level of their staff (predominantly undergraduate collegestudents), funding ( e.g., need for ongoing intervention to
treat pervasive symptoms, insurance limits treatment ses-
sions and types of treatments, so many families must payout-of-pocket for many services), societal constraints
(e.g., parents may demand specific services that are not
typically provided for specific symptoms of ASD), anddifficulty identifying EBP s for use with children with
ASD. ASD-CPs may be expected to adapt interventions
to meet the needs of the heterogeneous set of symptomsand behaviors displayed by children with ASD without
appropriate training or knowledge of the intervention.
Further, parents and consumer advocacy groups havea strong influence on legislation and funding for ser-
vices, thus affecting the organizational context of ASD
agencies [18].
Collaboration with community partners
Traditional efforts to implement EBPs in community set-tings have followed a research-to-practice approach to
implementation, wherein researchers disseminate new
EBPs to ASD-CPs in a unidirectional manner from thelaboratory to community and expect practitioners to
adopt, implement, and adhere to EBP protocols without
it being tailored for the agency context or ASD-CPscharacteristics, or inviting ASD-CPs to participate in the
development of, and decision-making about the protocol
[19]. Consequentially, efforts often result in failed imple-mentation, with providers reporting a lack of investment
in the EBP and focusing on different needs than those
being addressed by the EBP [20,21]. These challengeshighlight the need for improved collaboration between
academia and community stakeholders [22]. Numerous
collaborative partnership models exist, includingcommunity-based participatory research (CBPR) [21],
community-participatory partnered research (CPPR)
[23], participatory action research (PAR) [24], andacademic-community collaboration (ACC) [19,25]. Be-
cause this project is researcher-initiated, the ACC model
will be used. The ACC model is characterized by: sharedDrahota et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:85 Page 2 of 10
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/85
vision and impact benchmarks, building interdepend-
ence between collaborative partners, consensus and
shared decision making, and formalized collaborativestructure ( e.g., roles, responsibilities of collaborators).
ACC is an ideal approach to overcome previous imple-
mentation challenges because it involves community sta-keholders as partners in most aspects of research
endeavors [19,25] and will allow researchers to better
address issues of external validity, feasibility, and accept-ability of the AMI.
The autism model of implementation (AMI)
While numerous empirically-derived models exist that
are comprised of variables affecting adoption and imple-
mentation of EBPs [13-15], no models focus on imple-mentation of EBPs by ASD-CPs, specifically. Further,
few studies have conducted applied research to assess
the outcomes of these models of implementation inpractice. In the few studies investigating the application
of implementation models [26,27], key elements leading
to success have emerged, including: using distinct phasesto guide implementation; involving direct service provi-
ders and community members as collaborative partners
providing input on the uptake of EBPs; and providingcomprehensive training with ongoing support prior to
and during early EBP uptake.
T h ep u r p o s eo ft h i ss t u d yi st od e v e l o pt h eA M It h a t
will involve factors relevant to implementation on mul-
tiple levels, including ass essing both agency factors and
provider characteristics rela ted to facilitating or inhibit-
ing implementation of EBPs ( e.g., structured needs as-
sessment; standardized process for evaluating the EBP,
evaluating organizational ad option readiness factors).
In collaboration with ACC partners, a review of the lit-
erature and agency implementation assessment data
will guide the development of the AMI. Preliminarydiscussions with ASD-CPs indicate that some factors
included in general health service organizations ’mod-
els of implementation may be of particular importance
to the implementation of EBPs by ASD-CPs ( e.g.,o n -
going support, flexibility of EBP) and require greater
emphasis in the AMI. Furthermore, additional factorsm a yn e e dt ob ea d d e dt ot h eA M I( e.g., assess need fac-
tors). Although the exact factors included in the AMI
will require completion of aim one research activities,Figure 1 presents a preliminary model that has been
adapted in collaboration with ACC partners. In particu-
lar, questions remain about a feasible model andprocess of implementation, such as: within an ASD
community-based agency, who assesses client and
agency need and how; who identifies the appropriateEBP and how; and what structures and processes can
be embedded within the AMI regarding evaluating the
validity, feasibility, or adaptability of the EBP? Whatagency-level training process will facilitate EBP implemen-
tation? What structured evaluation of implementation is
needed to sustain the use of the EBP by ASD-CPs overtime? Results from aim one will be discussed with
ACC partners in order to refine the preliminary AMI
model.
The work in the proposed project will proceed in three
phases corresponding to three specific aims:
/C15Aim one: Assess agency antecedents and readinessfactors, individual ASD-CP characteristics, and
methods of implementing EBPs by ASD Leaders toidentify factors that facilitate or hinder adoption and
use of EBPs by ASD-CPs.
/C15Aim two: Develop the autism model of
implementation (AMI) with the focus on
identification, adoption, and use of EBPs within
community-based agencies serving childrenwith ASD.
/C15Aim three: Examine the feasibility and acceptabilityof the AMI through a small-scale pilot study. It ishypothesized that ASD-CPs will successfully
complete each activity within each phase of the
AMI to implement new EBPs within their ASDcommunity-based agencies.
Methods/Design
Aim one: Assess agency antecedents and readiness fac-
tors, individual ASD-CP characteristics, and methods of
implementing EBPs by ASD Leaders to identify factorsthat facilitate or hinder adoption and use of EBPs by
ASD-CPs.
Participants
At least two focus groups involving approximately five
to eight ASD-CPs will be conducted to assess perspec-tives related to EBP implementation factors. ASD-CPs
will include ASD agency Leaders as well as direct service
providers, and are expected to be mostly female andrange in educational level from college students to Ph.D.
level staff. Age is not known, but typically varies between
24 and 69 years [5]. It is expected that ethnical/racialcomposition will reflect that of mental health service
providers in San Diego, Imperial, and Orange Counties,
which is diverse.
Procedure
Prior to the focus group, the principal investigator (PI)will conduct a comprehensive literature review and iden-
tify theoretically derived implementation factors that are
likely to be relevant for the AMI [13-15]. Once identi-fied, implementation factors will be further examined for
applicability by using a mixed method research design
involving quantitative measures (see below) and focusDrahota et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:85 Page 3 of 10
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/85
groups of ASD-CPs. Findings will be used to expand or
narrow the focus of each theoretically derived imple-
mentation factor. Specifically, focus group participants
will be asked to complete and return the quantitativemeasures prior to the focus group in order to allow
focus group discussions to elaborate on the responses.
Focus groups will be convened at times convenient to amajority of participants to elicit perceptions of identified
implementation factors as well as previously unidentified
factors particular to ASD-CP services. Further, focusgroups will evaluate what methods are being used, if
any, to assess need, evaluate EBPs, make decisions
regarding adoption, and facilitating implementation ofEBPs.
Measures
Demographic survey
The demographic survey will provide informationabout the ASD-CPs individual characteristics includinggender, race/ethnicity, educational level, years as an
ASD-CP at and outside of their current ASD agency,
training received at the ASD agency, training receivedoutside of the ASD agency, and professional or net-
working organization membership.
Evidence-based practice attitude scale (EBPAS)
Focus group participants will complete the EBPAS[28,29], a structured questionnaire designed to assess
empirically-derived constructs related to adoption andimplementation of EBPs: appeal, requirements, open-
ness, divergence, and a total EBPAS score representing
the ASD-CPs global attitude toward EBPs [30,31].Children ’s services survey (CSS)
The CSS [32], adapted for use by ASD-CPs, will assess
organizational culture and climate in order to provide
information about factors related to implementing EBPs.
ASD community provider strategies survey (PSS)
The PSS, adapted for this study, will assess ASD-CPs ’use
of EBPs, knowledge of the evidence supporting the use ofthe practice, and whether they use the EBP or not, and
whether the have received formal training in the EBP [33].
Focus group data
Semi-structured focus group guides will be used withASD-CPs to elicit data on their perspectives on the follow-
ing topics: needs of both clients and ASD-CPs in regardto children with anxiety disorders; EBPs in general; agency
and ASD-CP factors that might facilitate or inhibit EBP
implementation; and their current process used to imple-ment EBPs (if any). Focus groups will be conducted until
the data collected reaches saturation ( i.e., the same infor-
mation is obtained from more than one group). The PIwill introduce the initial issues to be addressed and mod-
erate the dynamics of the group discussion to assure that
all views are represented. This structure is dictated by theobjective of collecting comparable data from both focus
groups. Focus group discussions will follow a ‘funnel inter-
view structure ’[34], starting with broader researcher-
driven issues and narrowing to more participant-driven
specific illustrations of these issues.

design and interpretation of data within the same study
[35], and is most appropriate for addressing the com-
plexities of modern social phenomena by utilizing mul-tiple approaches to understand a given phenomenon or
process [36]. This study will employ a mixed method ap-
proach in order to acquire understanding of the factorsinvolved in implementation by ASD-CPs, and to evalu-
ate the process of implementation that ASD-CPs are
currently using in order to identify facilitating and inhi-biting factors related to implementing EBPs by ASD-
CPs. Implementation factors are not easily quantified,
requiring the use of qualitative methods and data to in-form the development of structured assessment and
evaluation tools (quantitative measures) for future use.
Three different strategies will be employed when inte-grating quantitative and qualitative data, as suggested by
Creswell and Plano Clark [37]: triangulation, expansion,
and complementarity.
First, merging qualitative and quantitative data will
occur through triangulation in which results of quantita-
tive and qualitative analyses are placed side by side to de-termine whether each provides the same answer to the
same question (convergence; e.g., do ASD-CP focus group
data concur with quantitative data regarding attitudesregarding EBPs, organizational culture and climate, and
EBP use and knowledge). Second, results from qualitative
and quantitative analyses will be linked when the formeris used to provide explanations for unanticipated findings
produced by the latter (expansion; e.g., questionnaire data
will be used to assess the prevalence of emergent barriersto implementing EBPs observed in qualitative interviews).
Finally, results of qualitative analysis can be embedded
within the analysis of quantitative data by helping tocontextualize results obtained in statistical analyses fo-
cused on the questionnaires (complementarity).
Aim two: Develop the autism model of implementa-
tion (AMI) with focus on identification, adoption, and
use of EBPs within agencies serving children with ASD.
Participants
Development of the AMI will involve approximately
seven ACC partners. The ACC will be comprised of threeto five ASD-CPs who are responsible for directing,
supervising, or training direct service providers within
their agencies, one to two funding agency representa-tives ( e.g., regional centers, insurance companies, school
districts) who are knowledgeable about how funding deci-
sions are made for children with ASD, and an implementa-tion researcher with expertise in studying implementation
factors related to community agencies. A systematic re-
cruitment strategy will be used in order to maximize thediversity of ACC partners, which is expected to increase
the generalizability of the AMI to a variety of organiza-
tions, geographic locations, and providers.Procedure
In collaboration with ACC partners, the review of theliterature and aim one data will guide the developmentof the AMI. Specifically, results will be presented to
ACC partners to obtain feedback and additional inter-
pretation. Results and ACC partner feedback will beused to guide the development of the AMI and AMI
materials ( e.g., needs assessment materials, et al .). Al-
though the exact factors included in the AMI will re-quire completion of aim one research activities, the AMI
will likely include four phases: assessing needs of children
with ASD and the agency, examining EBP factors to ad-dress those needs, addressing organizational factors and
ASD-CP characteristics related to adoption, and identify-
ing implementation factors, such as training, EBP flexibil-ity, and ongoing support that will facilitate EBP use at the
agency (Figure 1). For each phase, the AMI will have spe-
cific products, developed by the PI in collaboration withACC partners, to be used by ASD Leaders in order to ac-
complish the goals of that phase. For example, ACC part-
ners who collaborated in the development of this proposalreported that assessing need was an important step for an
implementation model and that there was not a general-
ized, systematic assessment tool available for use by ASD-CPs. Therefore, an organizational assessment tool to
identify common clinical targets of school-age children
with ASD will be developed to support the implementa-tion of the AMI. Table 1 outlines likely materials sup-
porting AMI implementation.
Process of developing the AMI
The development of the AMI will involve an iterative
approach (Figure 2) involving the ACC partners. Specif-ically, the PI will revise the preliminary conceptual
model of the AMI based on the literature review and
aim one results. The ACC partners will provide feedbackto enhance the interpretation of aim one results and for
revisions to the AMI and AMI process materials. It is
expected that this iterative approach will increase the ex-ternal validity, feasibility, and acceptability of the AMI.
Aim three: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of
the AMI through a small-scale pilot study.
The AMI model will be designed for use by ASD
community-based agencies to implement any EBP. How-
ever, for this pilot study, an EBP has been chosen a
priori . This will allow for examination of each phase of
the AMI and preliminary comparison between use of the
AMI among agencies who participate in the pilot study.Specifically, an EBP to treat co-occurring anxiety disor-
ders in children with ASD has been targeted due to the
prevalence of anxiety disorders among school-age chil-dren with ASD and interest expressed by ACC partners.
Clinically significant anxiety disorders affect up to 80%
of school-age children with ASD, causing heightenedDrahota et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:85 Page 5 of 10

impairment above and beyond that caused by the ASD,
and is the second most highly prevalent problem
reported by parents [38-43]. Cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) to treat anxiety disorders in children with
ASD is considered evidence-based because multiple
laboratories using rigorous research designs and
methods ( e.g., randomized controlled trials) have found
evidence supporting its use to alleviate or reduce anxiety
symptoms or interference with large treatment effect sizes
at post-treatment compared to control conditions [44-46].Moreover, evidence suggests that intervening on chil-
dren ’s anxiety disorders has distal outcomes such as in-
creasing social and daily living skills, and family
functioning [44,47,48]. Preliminary data gathered from
ASD Leaders indicate that anx iety is a significant prob-
lem for some of the school-age children being provided
services at ASD community-based agencies. Interviews
with ASD Leaders regarding current use of CBT by
ASD-CPs found only two of the five agencies using CBT
strategies to treat anxiety among school-age childrenTable 1 AMI Process Materials for the AMI preliminary conceptual model

with ASD. Of these, one agency reported using a man-
ualized anxiety CBT developed for typically developing
children with anxiety disorders rather than developedfor children with ASD, and the other used exposure
therapy (a component of CBT) but indicated that ASD-
CPs were not certain about how to effectively use thispractice with children with ASD. Using the AMI to
implement a specific EBP to treat anxiety disorders
in school-age children with ASD, aim three willevaluate the: feasibility of using the AMI within ASD
community-based agencies; perceived fit, relevance, utility
and compatibility of the AMI within ASD community-based agencies; training and support in the use of the AMI
and AMI process materials; and observed fidelity of using
the AMI to implement at EBP within ASD community-based agencies.
Participants
Approximately 10 ASD Leaders ( e.g., clinical directors,
executive directors), not participating in the ACC, will be
recruited to participate in the AMI pilot study to test thefeasibility and acceptability of the AMI. An agency will
be eligible if it provides behavioral interventions, speech
and language therapy, or social skills training to childrenwith ASD and co-occurring anxiety disorders between the
ages of 7 –11 years. Agencies will be excluded if they do
not provide services to children aged 7 –11 years or do not
serve any children with co-occurring anxiety disorders.
Procedure
The AMI will be used to implement ‘Building Confi-
dence, ’a manualized CBT for children with ASD and co-
occurring anxiety disorders [49]. The PI is a co-authorof the manualized intervention and will consult with the
primary author throughout the pilot study to address
EBP factors ( e.g., time available for training, billing pro-
cedures, et al .), organizational adoption-related factors,
and factors facilitating implementation. The pilot test
will involve a pre-post design. ASD Leaders will be askedto complete questionnaires and participate in interviews
prior to and after implementation of the AMI. Measures
of AMI implementation will involve process and fidelitymeasures within each agency.
Data/measures
Data from the demographic survey, EBPAS, CSS, and
PSS used during aim one will be administered at pre-
and post-implementation of the AMI (see aim one formore information about these measures).
Stages of implementation completion (SIC)
The SIC [50] is a time-to-event based observational
measure of implementation progress that consists of eight
stages relating to specific implementation milestones.These milestones include: engagement, consideration of
feasibility, readiness planning, staff hired/trained, adher-
ence monitoring processes in place, services and consult-ation begin, ongoing services, consultation fidelity
monitoring and feedback, and competency. The mile-
stones span the timeframe from the engagement stagewhere initial contact between interested parties occurs
through the attainment of program competency stage.
Stages extend from ASD Leaders through ASD-CPs inorder to capture the multiple levels involved in imple-
mentation. The SIC is intended to be tailored to fit spe-
cific EBPs and implementation models, and can bemodified to assess quality and fidelity of the stages of
implementing the AMI. The measure authors have
agreed to work with the PI to adapt the SIC to best re-flect the phases and steps within the AMI. Analysis of
the SIC involves a time-to-event modeling method.
Individual interviews
Leaders will be interviewed prior to the AMI implemen-
tation to assess their perceptions of the AMI, includingperceived fit, relevance, utility, and compatibility with
their ASD agency. At post-implementation, interviews
will assess perspectives about the AMI, including feasibil-ity and acceptability, changes in agency process for
implementing EBPs, and changes in ASD-CP practices.
Individual interviews will take approximately 30 minutes.
Analysis plan: Integration of qualitative and quantitative
analyses
Repeated measures ANOVA for pre- and post-
implementation questionnair es will be used to examine the
changes that occurred during AMI. Due to the lack of acontrol group and the small sam ple sizes, interpretation of
effect sizes will be examined.
The SIC will be analyzed with guidance from the
measure authors and statistical consultant using the Cox
proportional hazards time-to-event modeling method
[51] within multiple stages. Analyses will replicate thoseused during the measure development. In particular, an
outside observer ( e.g., research assistant) will track the
dates of completion of each activity within each phase ofthe AMI in a stage-tracking database. From these data,
three scores are derived: the number of AMI phases
completed, the time spent in each AMI phase, and theproportion of AMI Process Materials completed in each
phase. For sites that choose to discontinue implementa-
tion, the discontinuation date will be logged accordinglyin the furthest phase that the site entered. If this occurs,
the time spent in the final phase of the AMI is calculated
between the date of the earliest activity within the phaseand the date of discontinuance. If the observation period
ends before the phase is completed but a site has not
discontinued implementation, the observation will beDrahota et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:85 Page 7 of 10

treated as being censored ( e.g., standard time-to-event
analysis).
Pre- and post-implementation interviews will be ana-
lyzed using a coding, consensus, and comparison meth-
odology [52], which follow an iterative approach rooted
in grounded theory [53]. Transcriptions will be inde-pendently coded by the PI and a trained research assist-
ant at a general level in order to condense data into
analyzable units. The coding will be reviewed by grantmentors and consultants. Transcriptions will be assigned
codes based on a priori or emergent themes. Transcrip-
tions may be assigned more than one code. Disagree-ments will be resolved through subsequent discussion
between research team members. The final list of codes
will be developed through consensus with ACC partners.Based on the codes, the process of axial coding will be
used to generate a series of categories arranged in a tree-
like structure connecting segments into separate cat-egories or nodes. Nodes and trees will be used to create
a taxonomy of themes, including a priori and emergent
categories and new, unrecognized categories. Results willbe presented to ACC partners for interpretation.
Finally, methods for integrating qualitative and quanti-
tative data for analyses will be the same as those used inaim one (see aim one for details).
Discussion
The AMI will represent a data-informed approach to fa-
cilitate implementation of EBPs by ASD-CPs by providing
an implementation model specifically developed for thiscontext. This study is designed to address the implications
of EBP implementation in ASD community-based agen-
cies. In doing so, the exploratory and developmental workproposed in this study aims have a positive public health
impact on the lives of children with ASD and their fam-
ilies by increasing the implementation of EBPs by ASD-CPs, especially for children with ASD with co-occurring
anxiety disorders. Moreover, the proposed study will posi-
tively impact the field of implementation science by pro-viding an empirically-supported and tested model of
implementation to facilitate the identification, adoption,
and use of EBPs by ASD-CPs, specifically.
In this project, the AMI will be developed and pilot
tested. The AIM is designed to assist ASD community-based agencies assess and find EBPs to their meet agency
needs, systematically evaluate the EBP for acceptability
and feasibility within the agency, consider salient adop-
tion factors, and guide the effective implementation of
the EBP. Through the use of the AMI phases and AMI
process materials ( e.g., structured materials guiding the
phases of implementation), it is hypothesized that imple-menting EBPs will be more likely for ASD community
agencies.Once developed and pilot tested, further refinement of
the AMI, including specific aspects of the AMI process
materials, will be done to allow for larger-scale imple-mentation studies focusing on testing the implementa-
tion effectiveness, generalizability, and sustainability of
the AMI. By continuing to involve ACC partners, the ex-ternal validity of refinements made to the AMI will in-
crease. Additionally, larger-scale studies will allow for
involving more varied organizations or systems providingservices to children with ASD ( e.g., school districts) as
well as diverse providers, and multilevel data ( e.g., ASD-
CPs nested within managers nested within agenciesnested within service systems). Future tests of the ef-
fectiveness of the AMI will not have an EBP selected a
priori.
