ABSTRACT
Introduction: A healthy lifestyle could have a positive impact in
reducing the incidence of some long-term sequelae secondary to
pediatric cancer treatments. Motivational communication (MC) iseﬀective at improving healthy lifestyle habits, especially when
patients experience change as a challenge. To date, there is no
available intervention program using MC that promotes healthy
lifestyles in pediatric oncology.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop the ﬁrst MC
training program for professionals in pediatric oncology and
assess its feasibility and acceptability.
Materials and methods: Following standard procedures involving
professionals, we developed a professional-targeted training
named the Motivation Cafés , consisting in six sessions of core MC
skills for healthcare professionals who wish to positively impact
lifestyles of families in pediatric oncology. We used a mixed-
methods quantitative-qualitative study to assess the programfeasibility and acceptability. Professionals in nutrition and physical
activity ( N= 16) attended two rounds of the training and
completed surveys to evaluate the training. They reported self-
eﬃcacy and knowledge in MC. Participation and retention rates
were used to assess acceptability and feasibility, and a thematicanalysis of the open-ended questions was performed to identify
strengths and weaknesses of the program to further re ﬁne the
program. We used non-parametric statistics to compare pre-post
changes on measures of self-e ﬃcacy and knowledge in MC.
Results: Attendance and retention (average 4.2/6 sessions
completed) were high, suggesting very good adherence andARTICLE HISTORY

feasibility. We also found high levels of acceptability and pertinence
of the program (i.e. >90%). The results suggested probable
improvements in self-e ﬃcacy and knowledge, but these were not
statistically signi ﬁcant given the limited sample size.
Conclusion: The training Motivation Cafés is now ready to be pilot
tested in pediatric cancer care centers.
Introduction
Medical advances a ﬀord survival rates often higher than 80% in pediatric cancer, with
some highly prevalent malignancies reaching a 90% cure rate in developed countriessuch as Canada and the United States (Hunger et al., 2012; Iyer, Balsamo, Bracken, &
Kadan-Lottick, 2015). However, these medical improvements take their toll in adulthood
for most cured children who have undergone these intensive cancer treatments, resultingin signi ﬁcant late e ﬀects such as cardiometabolic sequelae (Bhakta et al., 2017; Meacham
et al., 2010). Most common pediatric cancers are associated with increased frequency of
cardiometabolic outcomes, obesity, and a deterioration in physical ﬁtness in almost 75%
of survivors (Levy et al., 2017). These debilitating and life-threatening conditions can
occur decades after treatment (Hudson et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2017) and in ﬂuence the
quality of life of survivors (Brinkman et al., 2016).
Risk minimization in this very vulnerable population implies attending to risk factors
of cardiometabolic conditions such as a sedentary lifestyle and diet. Studies have
suggested the bene ﬁcial impact of nutrition and physical activity in the context of
adult cancer (Demark-Wahnefried & Jones, 2008). Research also suggests that physical
activity can bene ﬁt younger patients (i.e. pediatric and young adults) undergoing che-
motherapy (Huang & Ness, 2011). The musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune
systems may be strengthened, resulting in the short- and long-term prevention or miti-gation of treatment side e ﬀects (e.g. in ﬂammation, chronic fatigue) (Soares-Miranda
et al., 2013; Wolin, Ruiz, Tuchman, & Lucia, 2010). However, studies also show that pedi-
atric and adult cancer survivors tend to be less physically active than the general popu-lation (Demark-Wahnefried & Jones, 2008).
In childhood cancer survivors, a better adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as
the Mediterranean diet, improves metabolic and anthropometric status (e.g. visceral and
subcutaneous adiposity, waist circumference) (Tonorezos et al., 2013). Unfortunately,
survivors often do not follow dietary recommendations with 46% –88% nonadherence
to the Mediterranean diet and 51% of energy intake from highly processed food
(Bérard et al., 2020; Robien, Ness, Klesges, Baker, & Gurney, 2008). Furthermore, treat-
ments often induce a change in taste in patients, leading them to eat more fatty and salty
meals, modify their appetite and alter their eating behaviors, as reported by their primary
caregiver (Skolin et al., 2006). A healthy lifestyle in this context refer to a Mediterranean
diet, exercising at least 3×/week as recommended by the Canadian health authorities, and
avoiding harmful behaviors such as smoking. But these often remain di ﬃcult targets for
individuals and families to achieve (Robien et al., 2008).
By encouraging cancer patients and their families to adopt a healthier lifestyle, it
would be possible, from a preventive medicine perspective, to reduce the incidence ofHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 221
some long-term sequelae secondary to cancer treatments (Amireault, Fong, & Sabiston,
2018; Magill et al., 2014). As cardiometabolic processes are cumulative, change for a heal-
thier lifestyle should occur as soon as possible during treatment or in aftercare (Hudsonet al., 2013). To do so, both researchers and practitioners have suggested promoting
motivation using speci ﬁc communication techniques. Motivational interviewing (MI)
is a directive and collaborative conversational style that helps to strengthen a person ’s
motivation and commitment to change by exploring and resolving its ambivalence(Miller & Rollnick, 2013). Motivational communication (MC) is a ﬂexible, hybrid
version of MI anchored in cognitive –behavioral therapy and the self-determination
theory (SDT) of change (Deci & Ryan, 2002,2012; Rouleau et al., 2015). The MC
approach combines a series of strategies exploring ambivalence and motivation to
change in patients who are trying to adopt a sustainable healthy lifestyle via behavioral
modiﬁcations (Rouleau et al., 2015). The aim is to support patients in identifying what
motivates them intrinsically, and to help them modify risky lifestyle behaviors by addres-
sing their ambivalence towards change (Deci & Ryan, 2002,2012). MC incorporates
aspects that are not recognized as components of MI (e.g. decisional balance). Theapproach of MC is also strongly embedded in the three psychological needs that arethe pillars of SDT: the needs for competence, social relationships, and autonomy. In
MC, change is highly facilitated when the individual feels able to act in a speci ﬁc environ-
ment (competence), when she/he feels connected with the interventionist (socialrelationships), and when he/she feels being at the origin of her/his behavior (Deci &
Ryan, 2012; Dragomir et al., 2020). MC is designed to emphasize the autonomy of the
patient by favoring a respectful and constructive relationship with the professional(Laurin & Lavoie, 2011). Importantly, MC also makes use of inputs from the Trans-
theoretical Model of Change that was developed in parallel with MI in order to operatio-
nalize individual status and guide target and tool selection (Freeman & Dolan, 2001;
Miller & Rollnick, 2009). A good example is the staging of change: precontemplation,
contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse.
To date, MI has been studied in more than 200 randomized trials and 1000 publi-
cations across a range of disciplines and clinical settings (CMHA, 2017), and it is associ-
ated with favorable outcomes (Heather, Rollnick, Bell, & Richmond, 1996; Heckman,
Egleston, & Hofmann, 2010; Jensen et al., 2011). In pediatric populations, the use of
MI has helped improve dietary adherence to diabetic treatment and obesity and hasdecreased high-risk sexual behaviors (Berg-Smith, Stevens, Brown, & Smith, 1999;
Channon et al., 2007; Knight et al., 2003). Motivational techniques have also been associ-
ated with improvements in substance abuse, diet, and physical activity (Lundahl et al.,2013). However, compared to interventions with adults, there are fewer applications of
motivational techniques in pediatrics. Speci ﬁcally, family interventions are still scarce
due to various factors such as the developmental context of the family (e.g. parentsadjusting their parenting style to match the child ’s needs for independence), the systemic
presentation of distress (e.g. high levels of con ﬂict in the family, opposing views between
child and parent), and the responses of families to life cycle stages (Naar-King & Suarez,
2011; Nock & Ferriter, 2005; Nock & Kazdin, 2005).
In cancer care, applications of motivational strategies have exclusively focused on
adult populations. They have targeted physical activity, weight loss, and diet (Demark-
Wahnefried & Jones, 2008; Spencer & Wheeler, 2016). In this context, studies have222 S. DEWEZ ET AL.
shown results that align with other areas of study suggesting that motivational techniques
are particularly e ﬀective at improving healthy lifestyles when compared to no counseling
at all, to phone calls with no MI content, to print material only, or to verbal advice(Spencer & Wheeler, 2016).
Training programs designed for professionals do exist (Barwick, Bennett, Johnson,
McGowan, & Moore, 2012; Rouleau et al., 2015) and may rely on undergraduate inter-
ventionists (Kumar et al., 2017). Professionals may also receive credits in MC/MI as part
of their university curriculum. Evaluation studies of these programs systematically
support training e ﬀects for all MI skills, despite variations in training structure,
outcome measures, and the quality of studies (Barwick et al., 2012). The research evalu-
ating training programs for professionals applying motivational strategies to pediatric
populations have focused on adolescent health, particularly substance abuse (Eenshuis-
tra, Harder, & Knorth, 2020; Mitcheson, Bhavsar, & McCambridge, 2009; Seigart,
Veltman, Willhaus, & Letterle, 2018; Vallabhan et al., 2017).
To date, there is no available training program in MC explicitly for health pro-
fessionals working in pediatric oncology settings (i.e. with expertise in lifestyle/behav-ioral change). The speci ﬁcity of the clinical context, the vulnerability of the
population, and the need to positively in ﬂuence the family as a unit, are aspects that
warrant novel developments (Bass, 2018). New training programs are timely, aiming
at promoting healthy lifestyles in pediatric oncology in order to develop new skills inclinical and research settings.
In the present project, we aimed to develop the ﬁrst MC training program for pro-
fessionals working in pediatric oncology. As a ﬁrst objective, we wished to develop
and re ﬁne a training program in MC. Based on current behavioral program development
models, we wished to study the feasibility and acceptability (e.g. attendance, retention,
pertinence) of the training. As a second objective, we wished to explore if the trainingwould be related to increases in self-e ﬃcacy and knowledge of MC. These key outcomes
are pertinent targets as previous studies have shown that MC training programs
improved knowledge, as well as con ﬁdence and intention (i.e. self-e ﬃcacy) in using
MC (Rouleau et al., 2015).
Method
Development of the training program
Weﬁrst gathered a team of MC specialists f rom the CanChange network as well as
researchers and clinicians in pediatric h ematology-oncology from our healthcare
center (Sainte-Justine UHC) in Montreal.1To develop the ﬁrst version of the
program, we favored an active involvement of en d-users (i.e. professionals, clinicians,
healthcare providers) via regular particip ation of and consultation with the executive
research team, in order to ensure their training needs were being met. To guide thedevelopment of the training, we followed steps suggested in the Obesity-Related
Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) to de ﬁne the intervent ion (Czajkowski
et al., 2015 ). The initial phase consists of det ermining the elements and format of
the program for adaptation to the context and further clinical relevance. Accordingly,
after a thorough literature review on previ ous experiences of MC in pediatrics, we metHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 223
with three clinicians and team leaders in nut rition and exercise counseling from our
center to identify their most frequent challenges and needs when addressing lifestyle
change in this context. One-on-one consul tations were conducted in the Fall of 2017
with them to identify expected issues or ba rriers encountered during interventions
with children and adolescents with cancer and their families. We explored organiz-
ational preferences regardi ng participation in training sessions on MC. This was
done to assist in the creation of tools and to make decisions regarding the core
topics to include in the training (e.g. pedia tric oncology cases, role-playing showing
patients ’resistance and ambivalence, supervisio no ne x i s t i n gc a s e s ) .F o l l o w i n gt h i s
phase, we chose the core topics to be included in the training (i.e. the key methodsand complex skills of MC) and the format of the training (i.e. a series of short sessions
focusing on active learning and practice ). The research team also agreed on a logic
model, presenting the interconnections be tween the target population, program com-
ponents, intervention procedures, outco mes (short-, medium-, and long-term) and
behavioral targets ( Figure 1 ). Following educational standards and to ensure reprodu-
cibility, we created a training manual for practitioners, with instructions and pro-cedures for future program facilitators.
The training is called Motivation Cafés and consists of six core MC skills training
sessions for healthcare professionals and providers who wish to positively impact life-
styles of families in pediatric oncology ( Table 1 ). The focus was set on diet and physical
activity counseling as these are the most prominent themes in pediatrics. Motivation
Cafés covers key-factors of motivation and commitment, stages of change, active listen-
ing, questioning, ambivalence, and an integration of acquired knowledge and compe-tencies (Freeman & Dolan, 2001; Miller & Rollnick, 2013). The context and cases are
speciﬁc to clinical aspects and challenges encountered in pediatric oncology. For
example, the case of Justin, a ﬁctitious 10-year-old boy described in Session 2, demon-
strates three di ﬀerent stages of behavior change in terms of physical activity, when he is
experiencing fatigue due to chemotherapy treatments. Each session is organized to
follow a given set of activities: the theoretical content of MC, an intervention tool
related to the theory presented, role-playing based on case studies, and some supervi-sion time o ﬀered by the instructors to provide feedback targeting issues reported by
participants. To ensure that all instructions and communications are consistent with
MC principles, the sessions were supervised by a certi ﬁed consultant in MC (CL, Can-
Change fellow). Her primary role was to support and enrich the training program and
help supervise the participants. Participants were given access to the manual within and
between sessions.
The Motivation Cafés training manual describes in detail the theory and intervention
tools, with examples of transcripts. In addition, the transcripts of each role-play are pro-
vided. At the bottom of each transcript, we included additional questions for participantsdesigned to self-re ﬂect about their own clinical skills and knowledge. We also included an
infographic summarizing the key intervention tools of MC (e.g. a scale of motivation or
conﬁdence to work on patient ambivalence) to be used with patients depending on their
readiness for change stage (e.g. contemplation) (Freeman & Dolan, 2001; Miller & Roll-
nick, 2013). Copies of the manual and the infographic are available in English and in
French as online supplementary material to this article.224 S. DEWEZ ET AL.
Reﬁnement of the training Motivation Cafés
Reﬁning the training design consists of detailing its components, delineating its
intensity, frequency and duration, and preparing the program for preliminary
testing (Czajkowski et al., 2015). This process aims to improve the program ’s
strength and e ﬃciency (i.e. best potential clinical e ﬀect on the target populationFigure 1. Logic model: Motivational Cafés . As per the guidelines published in Dagenais and Ridde

with the minimum waste of resources) while ensuring that it will not harm the target
population. This part focuses on the feasibility and acceptability of the program. The
whole research process was approved by the local research ethics committee (ethicsapproval number 2017-1413), and all participants provided written consent.
Participants
We recruited a convenience sample of healthcare professionals in our center via email,
during short presentations at team meetings, and via team leaders. To be included in
this study, participants had to be involved in an ongoing multimodal interventionprogram focusing on nutrition and physical activity counseling with families who had
a child being treated for cancer at our cancer care center (CHU Sainte-Justine, 2019).
Participants also had to have direct contact with patients and families. The trainingintended to target professionals in nutrition and physical activity, as we used examplesand cases formulations from those ﬁelds. As this part focused on re ﬁnement, we did
not specify any exclusion criteria, such as previous training in MC or other related
techniques.
Procedures
A sequential mixed-method design was used to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability
of the training. We used self-reported questionnaires that had both open-endedTable 1. Themes, content, tools and activities of the Motivation Cafés training program.

questions and forced-choice questions using Likert scales. The ﬁrst round of the training
sessions was conducted in May and June 2018 following a schedule that met participants ’
needs. The next step was to assess and re ﬁne the training by taking into consideration
survey results. A second re ﬁned version of the training was then ﬁeld tested in a
second round with another group of participants during Fall 2018.
Measures
Demographics
We collected sociodemographic information for participants: age, sex, occupation, years
of experience, education, and previous participation in MC training or related
techniques.
Social validity
We used the Social Validity Questionnaire (SVQ) from Ogez et al. ( 2019). This is a
French-language version of questions developed by Kazdin ( 2005) and Manne, Mee,
Bartell, Sands, and Kashy ( 2016)t oﬁt the clinical context of pediatric oncology. This
questionnaire was completed at the end of each session. It includes 2 items measuringthe pertinence (i.e. items 1 and 3) and 3 items on acceptability (i.e. items 2, 4, and 5)of the training program: (1) ‘Iﬁnd the training useful to help me in my interventions ’;
(2)‘I recommend the training to another professional ’; (3) ‘Iﬁnd the training impor-
tant/relevant for the patients I follow ’; (4) ‘I learned something new from this training ’;
(5)‘Iﬁnd that the training has met its objectives ’. The questionnaire also includes two
open-ended questions requesting participants to report their evaluation of the structure
and content of each session (e.g. ‘what are the strengths of the training ’;‘what are the
points that need to be improved ’). When appropriate, participants provided their
responses on a self-report measure with seven forced choice questions about whether
they agreed with statements about pertinence and acceptability (1 = totally disagree to
7=totally agree ). Items were summed into two scores: Pertinence (inter-item r= 0.62)
and Acceptability (inter-item r= 0.38).
Self-eﬃcacy
We developed a 10-item questionnaire selecting 8 items from the Self-E ﬃcacy question-
naire-12 (SE-12; Axboe, Christensen, Kofoed, & Ammentorp, 2016, items #1, 2, 4, 8 –12)
and two self-created items to speci ﬁcally address con ﬁdence and motivation. The tool
was named SE-10 and closely tapped aspects being trained in the
Motivation Cafés .
The instrument assesses the participant ’s self-described competence (self-e ﬃcacy), con ﬁ-
dence, and motivation to use MC in his or her everyday practice. It was administered atthe start of each individual session. The con ﬁdence and motivation items are rated from 1
to 10 (single item scores). Participants provided their responses about whether they felt
conﬁdent and/or motivated using MC (1 = not at all con ﬁdent ornot at all motivated to
10 = totally con ﬁdent ortotally motivated ): e.g. ‘In the past two weeks, how con ﬁdent
were you applying MC strategies to your patients ’. The perceived competence or capa-
bility to use MC is composed of eight items with a total range of 8 –80. Sample items
include: ‘In the past two weeks, how certain are you that you have been able to: …suc-
cessfully check patient ’s understanding of the information given, …successfully make a228 S. DEWEZ ET AL.
plan based on shared decisions between you and the patient ’, etc. Participants responded
about whether they were certain concerning their competence to use MC (1 = very uncer-
tainto 10 = totally certain ) (inter-item r= 0.35). The questionnaire also includes open-
ended questions to collect the experience of participants on successful/unsuccessful com-munication skills since the last session.
Knowledge
We used the MC Knowledge Questionnaire (MCKQ) adapted by Dr. Kim Lavoie and
based on original work by Barwick et al. ( 2012) (K. Lavoie, personal communication,
April 20, 2018). Participants provided their responses on a self-report measure with 14multiple-choice items, with total scores varying from 0 to 14, and reported as percen-
tages, re ﬂecting participants ’knowledge of MC. For each item, the respondent had to
choose between two to six possible answers, when appropriate. A sample item is:‘True or false? Ambivalence is especially present in the stages of contemplation and prep-
aration ’. The instrument was assigned only to the Fall participants of the second round of
the program following participants ’suggestion from the ﬁrst round. The instrument was
administered twice, before the training (i.e. pre) and at the end of the six-session program
(i.e. post) and at three and six months. No consistency coe ﬃcient is available for this
count score (Streiner, 2003).
Analysis
We documented feasibility with participation and retention rates. We described quanti-tative scores of acceptability, pertinence, self-e ﬃcacy, and knowledge, and used non-
parametric Wilcoxon signed rank sum and Friedman one-way repeated measure analysis
tests to compare changes across time. The Cohen ’sdwas used to calculate e ﬀect sizes and
we calculated frequencies when appropriate. To compare change across Summer/Falltraining sessions, we used the Mann –Whitney U test. To further explore if changes in
these outcomes would be associated with attendance, we correlated percent changes in
self-eﬃcacy and knowledge with number of sessions attended. Quantitative data were
managed in IBM SPSS v24. Using the principles of thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke,
2012), we also identi ﬁed and described themes from the written content collected in
response to open-ended questions. The qualitative data were treated and coded in aMicrosoft Excel 2010 spreadsheet. Emergent descriptive themes were identi ﬁed and
associated with corresponding quotes by reading the comments and producing a list
of key elements for each theme. The coding book was built progressively and used as
a reference throughout the coding and veri ﬁcation process. As textual answers to
open-ended questions were short and simple, a systematic intercoder assessment was
not necessary, and a structured summary of participants feedback was created. Qualitat-
ive themes were triangulated with observation notes from the sessions and the generalappreciation of the intervention ’s facilitators.
Results
We invited 23 professionals, 19 agreed to participate, but only 16 took part to the sessions
(participation = 70%) and were subsequently evaluated. The participants were all activein pediatric oncology: 9 (56%) were specialists in physical activity, 4 (25%) wereHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 229
nutritionists, 1 (6%) was a child psychologist, 1 (6%) was a nurse and 1 (6%) was a
researcher. The latter two were involved in the coordination of clinical and research
activities in pediatric oncology. The participants were, on average, 28 ± 6 years old andprimarily women ( n= 15, 93%). Eight (50%) professionals mentioned having attended
MC training in the past either formally (e.g. at a university or in a hospital), or informally
(i.e. readings or tutorials). Five participated in both the Summer and Fall training ses-
sions. Attendance for the Summer and Fall sessions was N= 14 and N= 7, respectively.
Feasibility and acceptability of the training
Participation
On average, participants attended 4.2 (±2.7) training sessions with 9 (56%) attendingmore than three, and 6 (37%) attending more than four sessions. Four (25%) attended
all six sessions. Five participants from the ﬁrst Summer round felt it was necessary to
continue their training and participated in the second Fall round.
Acceptability and pertinence
Participants ended each encounter by completing the SVQ questionnaire. Overall, theyconsidered the encounters as highly acceptable ( M= 93.2%) and pertinent ( M= 93%).
These results were similar across both training periods with Summer/Fall mean accept-
ability rates of 93.2% and 93.2%, respectively, and Summer/Fall mean pertinence rates of92.8% and 93.1%, respectively. When examining results by session, we found medianscores of acceptability for individual sessions to be: S1: 90.5%, S2: 90.5%, S3: 100%, S4:
100%, S5: 100%, S6: 100%, and; pertinence to be: S1: 100%, S2: 96.5%, S3: 100%, S4:
100%, S5: 92.9%, S6: 100%, showing high homogeneity and high scores across sessions.
Strengths of the intervention . These high scores were also re ﬂected by responses to
open-ended questions. Participants appreciated the content they found clear and relevant
as they perceived it o ﬀered structured intervention tools tailored to their needs (e.g. P19:
‘Examples that allow me to approach patients di ﬀerently ’). In fact, they reported that
skills and communication tools were used between training sessions and reported
them as bene ﬁcial when interacting with patients and families. In addition, belonging
to a stable group throughout the six-session training favored mutual support among par-ticipants. Participants shared their clinical experiences and how they solved issues, which
helped others conceptualize and plan their own interventions. They reported that one of
the highlights of the training was the use of role-playing based on scenarios speci ﬁc to the
pediatric hematology-oncology setting. For example, P1 reported: ‘Practicing scenarios
and re ﬂecting on them allowed me to be more comfortable with the tools ’. Finally, par-
ticipants were particularly satis ﬁed with the time allotted in each session to apply theor-
etical principles into practice. They felt this practical part provided a safe space to practice
the intervention tools. For example, P1 reported: ‘I appreciated the practical aspect,
because the theory seems easy to do, but it is di ﬃcult to apply ’and, P15 reported: ‘I
loved the practice with the musical chair exercise …An excellent way to integrate
everything ’.
Issues raised . First, as scenarios were speci ﬁc, participants questioned generalizability
to other situations. For example, P8 reported: ‘The situations are slightly easy or rosy, so
you may consider building various story options in which things do not develop as230 S. DEWEZ ET AL.
expected ’. This also points to the necessity of more complex cases. Second, participants
found that time management was an issue. Some found the sessions were scheduled too
late after their work shift and that trainers did not respect the schedule, some sessionslasting longer than planned (sessions were planned to last one hour). Finally, participantsalso felt that they needed more concise material, such as a formal document synthesizing
the theory and tools. For example, P10 reported: ‘It would be great to have the tools sum-
marized and provided in paper format, so that we could take notes ’.
Adjustments made to intervention . From these remarks following the Summer round,
we reﬁned the training for the Fall. First, although it was judged already excellent, we
further improved transferability to practice by reinforcing the family interventioncontent. Although research regarding motivational approaches in family interventions
is still at an early stage, we revamped the last session, initially serving as a recap
session, to include family intervention tools. Second, we made sure to adhere to the sche-dule and set an appropriate training moment in the day (i.e. at lunch time instead of after
their work shift). Third, to better support the participants, we prepared a one-page info-
graphic summarizing the theoretical model underpinning MC and the communicationtools addressed in the training (supplementary material).
Changes in self-e ﬃcacy
Here, we explored changes in self-reported competence, con ﬁdence, and motivation to
use MC in the future. Scores from the SE-10 were converted in percentage for partici-pants attending two or more sessions ( n= 15). When examining di ﬀerences between
the scores of the ﬁrst and last attended session, we observed that scores increased, on
average, by 20% in competence, 11% in con ﬁdence, and 7% in motivation. Yet, none
of these di ﬀerences reached statistical signi ﬁcance (Wilcoxon p> 0.078). Changes were
consistent across Summer and Fall sessions (Mann –Whitney p> 0.464). When examin-
ing correlations between self-e ﬃcacy changes and the number of sessions attended, we
observed no association ( r< 0.10, p> 0.731). E ﬀect sizes for the Summer sessions were
d= 0.70 (medium, Cohen, 2016) for perceived competence, d= 0.74 (medium) for the
conﬁdence to use MC, and d= 0.23 (small) for the motivation to use MC. We found
small e ﬀect sizes for the Fall sessions, with d= 0.14, d= 0.23, and d=−0.14, respectively.
In response to open-ended questions, participants reported having used MC com-
munication tools between training sessions, for example: questioning patients on advan-
tages and disadvantages of change, establishing a treatment plan in collaboration with thepatient, re ﬂecting the feeling and/or the ambivalence, identifying and questioning bar-
riers to change, and actively listening to the needs of patients. They assessed some inter-
ventions as particularly bene ﬁcial when interacting with patients and families. For
example, P4 responded: ‘I explore and rephrase with the patient the advantages of
change, making the patient feel capable ’; P8 responded: ‘I was able to establish a relation-
ship of trust, normalize the patient ’
sd iﬃculties, and re ﬂect on the patient ’s values ’; P14
responded: ‘I asked permission to make some suggestions to the patient, and I was able to
establish reachable objectives ’, and; P16 responded: ‘I restated the patient ’s mentioned
diﬃculties, and asked open-ended questions without directing the conversation ’.
On the other side, participants reported di ﬃculties while using some MC tools and
techniques learned during the training, especially when they were dealing withHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 231
adolescents or their parents. For example, P4 reported: ‘It was more di ﬃcult using MC
with teens, and showing empathy when they were going with their families through
more di ﬃcult times ’; P15 reported: ‘MC is more challenging with teenagers ’, and; P8
reported: ‘It was challenging reinforcing change-talk, establishing clear goals, and ques-
tioning parents about what they learned from the session ’. Other di ﬃculties experienced
by participants were based on using the MC communication style. For example, P21
responded: ‘it’s hard not to provide information as we used to do ’, and P19 responded:
‘I had trouble summarizing and focusing on the goals ’.
Changes in knowledge
Scores on the MCKQ of the Fall participants tended to increase post-training with base-
line/post-training/3-month/6-month follow-ups with Ms(SDs) values of 78 ± 15.7%, 84
± 7.8%, 91 ± 3.1%, and 90 ± 3.8%. Yet, this increase did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance
(Friedman p> 0.221). We observed no signi ﬁcant association when examining corre-
lations between knowledge changes and the number of sessions attended ( r< 0.89, p>
0.109).
Discussion
In line with recommendations on program development (Czajkowski et al., 2015), we
deﬁned and re ﬁned the design of the training Motivation Cafés , a manualized training
program aimed to enhance MC competencies in healthcare professionals working in
pediatric oncology. Following responses to questionnaires, supervision sessions, struc-
tured collection of feedback, we assessed the acceptability and feasibility of theprogram, identifying strengths and limitations, and collected future suggestions formodiﬁcations of the training sessions. Until now no training has been available in MC
for professionals dealing with the clinical particularities of children, adolescents, and
families in pediatric oncology. Few studies estimating the e ﬀect of a training in MI or
MC in clinicians working with children and adolescents exist (Barwick et al., 2012).
As a point of comparison, we found a randomized trial evaluating the outcome of an
MI training for practitioners working in adolescent substance abuse (Mitcheson et al.,2009). Other studies have assessed the implementation of MI training programs in
nursing students, and the training of healthcare providers and counselors in the use of
MI for youth behavior change (Eenshuistra et al., 2020; Seigart et al., 2018; Vallabhan
et al., 2017).
Acceptability and program relevance
The results highlight the acceptability and relevance of the program. First, participation
was consistent through both training periods and one-third decided to follow the secondround to repeat the training in order to consolidate their newly acquired skills.
Second, the structure of the training program and its components aim to improve MC
competency in healthcare professionals working in pediatric oncology through a novelseries of sessions combining theoretical presentations, practical exercises, interventiontools applied to typical cases in the ﬁeld, and supervision for complex situations.232 S. DEWEZ ET AL.
Participants at both the Summer and Fall rounds scored high on acceptability and rel-
evance questionnaires. This is noteworthy considering that professionals from the Fall
sessions also participated in the Summer sessions, suggesting that the program did notlose its relevance or acceptability over time. Participants emphasized the relevance of pre-senting and demonstrating structured intervention tools tailored to their patients ’issues.
The bene ﬁt of having supervision time that a ﬀorded interactions between healthcare pro-
fessionals in the sharing of their experiences was also considered relevant by the partici-pants. Participants highlighted some limitations, the major one being time management,
and the fact that the training program initially did not re ﬂect on family interventions. To
address those limitations, we proceeded with modi ﬁcations to improve the second round
of the training, following recommendations on program re ﬁnement (Czajkowski et al.,
2015).
When reviewing the literature on MC, we only found one study addressing program
satisfaction. Like with Motivation Cafés , Seigart et al. ( 2018) demonstrated that nursing
students who attended their MI training were very satis ﬁed with the content and simu-
lation experiences. However, they did not ﬁnd diﬀerences in terms of adolescents ’atti-
tudes toward substance use. Given the high satisfaction response in their study, theauthors underscored the importance of the implementation of MI in healthcare and
the necessity to continue the evaluation of existing training programs (Seigart et al.,
2018).
Competence in MC, con ﬁdence and motivation to use MC
Our results suggest that change was likely with regards to competence, con ﬁdence and
motivation to use MC. Although results were not statistically signi ﬁcant, small to medium
eﬀect sizes on competence, con ﬁdence and motivation to use MC suggest changes could
be detected if more participants were included. Smaller changes in the Fall round may
also be because ﬁve participants already were trained in the Summer sessions (i.e. ceiling
eﬀect). In fact, when looking at their competence/motivation/con ﬁdence values, we
observed that participants had higher levels than the rest of the group before training.
Similarly, evaluation of programs designed for professionals working with children or
adolescents have not demonstrated statistically signi ﬁcant improvement in outcomes
such as competencies. In a randomized trial, Mitcheson et al. ( 2009) used the MI Treat-
ment Integrity Version 2 (MITI Version 2) to assess practitioner competency in simu-
lated sessions with trained actors and showed no impact upon skill levels. The authorsonly highlighted an e ﬀect on the MI spirit (i.e. embracing MI style and way of being).
On the other hand, Eenshuistra et al. ( 2020) revealed that counselors intervening in resi-
dential youth care adhered signi ﬁcantly more to MI behaviors after the training they
received. The authors observed that they used fewer behaviors not adhering to MIafter training. Some MI competency requirements were however not met such as the
ratio of re ﬂections made to questions asked (Eenshuistra et al., 2020).
Knowledge in MC
For those who were assessed on knowledge, we observed high results in knowledge on
MC before starting training. Most participants, as nutritionists and physical activityHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 233
professionals, had previously received a past MI training. Although not statistically sig-
niﬁcant due to a very small sample, changes from 78%, to 90% (i.e. change of +15%) in
scores on the MCKQ are suggestive of improvements associated with training.
Limitations
We must recognize the limitations of this study, the ﬁrst being the sample size. Although
we aimed to recruit a variety of professionals, the ﬁnal numbers for the Fall sessions
remained limited and results are not generalizable. Given their central role in patients ’
care, other professionals (such as nurses, physicians) could also be trained in thefuture. The content of the training Motivation Cafés is probably adapted for them but
this should be con ﬁrmed. Second, although results speak in favor of feasibility and accept-
ability of the training, the uncontrolled design does not allow for determining the impactof the program on potential outcomes measures. It is also important to note that only a
minority of participants followed all six sessions, which may question intervention
ﬁdelity. Encouraging consistent participation could call on allowing CE credits to
enhance participants ’engagement. Our team is now developing an online version of
theMotivation Cafés to cope with the current pandemic, and this too could increase par-
ticipation. Participants had a high knowledge of MC pre-training, which draws attention
to a possible selection bias, the sample holding positive views toward MC. Future researchshould explore whether the Motivation Cafés yields positive changes using an appropriate
study design and the assessment of communication skills in participants. When studying
family-level outcomes, it would of course be of major interest to collect the perception ofend-users on the program. Finally, other components of a healthy lifestyle could be tar-
geted such as smoking, drinking, and sleeping habits.
In conclusion, we developed a new training for pediatric oncology settings designed to
help clinicians communicate better when trying to change health behaviors. The Motiv-
ation Cafés appears acceptable and feasible. It is a promising training program to be
studied in future research. Although not conclusive, pre-post changes in motivation,self-eﬃcacy, and knowledge, suggest that these are favorably enhanced following train-
ing. Future studies should pilot-test the present training and assess gains in competency
using objective behavioral measures and control groups. Provided that these future steps
are followed and successful, the Motivation Cafés could help improve patients ’health
behaviors in the domains of physical activity and nutrition, which is paramount in the
pediatric oncology population.
