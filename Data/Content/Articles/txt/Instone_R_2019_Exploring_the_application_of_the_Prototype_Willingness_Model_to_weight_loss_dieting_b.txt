 Exploring the application of the Prototype Willingness Model to weight  loss dieting 
behaviour among UK adults  
ABSTRACT  
Frequent weight loss dieting leads to increased BMI and is associated with eating pathologies.  
Theoretical models can aid the development of interventions to reduce  risk behaviours such as 
frequent dieting  if they are able to adequately account for the target behaviour.  The Prototype 
Willingness Model (PWM) may be able to account for weight loss dieting as this behaviour is often associated with social images. This study explored whether the PWM could pred ict weight 
loss dieting status over and above the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB).  One hundred and ninety two participants (69% female; mode age 35 -44) completed PWM and TPB measures and 
recorded their height and weight. Males were more likely to be non- dieters than females. 
Frequent dieters had a higher BMI than non -dieters and rated themselves as more similar to the 
overweight prototype.  Prototype perceptions predicted willingness to eat unhealthy foods 
alone. Similarity to the overweight prototype pr edicted weight loss dieting status over and 
above TPB measures and sex. Further research should explore prototype perceptions in an 
obese/overweight frequent dieting population as this may be a fruitful direction for developing interventions to reduce weig ht loss dieting.

 Exploring the application of the Prototype Willingness Model to weight loss dieting 
behaviour among UK adults  
INTRODUCTION  
Obesity is associated with heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, and people who are perceived to 
be overweight o ften face stigma (WHO, 2017).  At any point in ti me, it has been estimated that 
about 40% of the global population may be attempting to restrict calorie intake in order to 
reduce their weight (Santos, Sniehotta, Marques, Carraça, & Teixeira, 2016) .  In the United 
Kingdom (UK),  for example, around 50% of the population attempted to lose weight in 2015 , 
however many of those  people were unsuccessful in their goal (Mintel, 2016).  Problematically, 
evidence suggests that weight loss dieting (WLD) actually leads to increased BMI (Neumark -
Sztainer , Wall, Story, & Standish, 2012; Siahpush et al., 2015) .  WLD is also associated with 
eating pathologies  (Lowe & Timko, 2004; Neumark -Sztainer et al., 2006).  Thus, interventions to 
reduce engagement in WLD are re quired . Health psychologists have highlighted the importance 
of using theory for successful intervention development (Albarracin et al., 2005).  It is crucial, 
therefore, to understand the theoretical drivers of WLD .  
The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB ), (Ajzen, 1991)  is widely used for investigating health 
behaviours . In the TPB, b ehaviours are determined by intentions, which  are a product of 
attitudes, subjective norms , and perceived behavioural control (PBC) . A systematic review of 
TPB inter ventions found only small to moderate effect size s (Hardeman et al., 2002), but d espite 
this, the TPB remains a popular basis for interventions (Sniehotta, Presseau, & Araujo -Soares, 
2014) . The TPB may be  particularly lacking when it comes to  WLD  as th is behaviour is often 
influenced by media images of  body shape s (Fernandez & Pritchard, 2012).  Dieting is also 
associated with personal body image concerns, where the thin ideal is internalized (Thompson & Stice, 2001), and may in part be motivated by a fear of fatness because of such societal ideals (Dalley, Toffanin, & Pollet, 2012) .  Perceived weight status may paradoxically lead to  increased 
4 
 weight (Robinson, Hunger, & Daly, 2015) because more weight loss attempts are made, this is 
further associated with weight gain (Haynes, Kersbergen, Sutin, Daly, & Robinson, 2017).  Thus, 
perception of oneself is an i mportant determinant of WLD and warrants further attention.  
One theory that takes such perceptions  into account is the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM) 
(Gerrard, Gibbons, Houlihan, Stock, & Pomery, 2008; Gibbons & Gerrard, 1995) .  Within this 
model, there are two routes to behaviour.  The first is  a planned route,  via attitudes , social 
norms and intentions , similar to  the TPB.  The second is via ‘prototypes’ and ‘willingness’ and is 
postulated to operate in a more spontaneous manner to the planned route.  Two elements of 
prototype  perception are import ant– ‘favourability’ (how appealing the prototype is to the 
individual) and ‘similarity’ (how similar the individual perceives themselves to be to the prototype).  The PWM is thought to have particular success at predicting risk behaviours in this 
adolesce nts because they are, in general, very image conscious and therefore sensitive to peers’ 
approval or disapproval (Gerrard et al., 2008) . However, the developmental trajectory of this 
sensitivity is unknown and it may be that older adults are still susceptible  to image -conscious 
tendencies that may influence their behaviours (Gibbons & Gerrard, 2016) .   
Gerrits et al (Gerrits, de Ridder, de Wit, & Kuijer, 2009; Gerrits et al., 20 10) explored healthy and 
unhealthy eating in adolescents.   A dolescents had favourab le perceptions of healthy eaters but 
these were unrelated to eating behaviours. Unhealthy eater prototypes on the other hand, were related to diet and eating, suggesting this could be a meaningful intervention target in this age group (Gerrits et al., 2009; Gerrits et al., 2010) .   In an female adult population, the influence of 
fat and thin prototypes on WLD  behaviour was unequal (Dalley & Buunk, 2009).  As  perceived 
similarity to the fat prototype increased and favourability de creased, WLD  increased . Thin 
prototype  favourability did not predict WLD . This finding converges with previous research that 
suggests the proximity to the undesired self rather than d istance from the desired self, 
influences behaviour.  The study did not use a wide weight range with most participants in the normal BMI range (mean=22.16, SD=3.00) and findings may differ for an overweight or obese 
5 
 cohort.  The present study builds on Dal ley and Buunk’s (2009) study in two main ways. Firstly, 
it tests how well the whole PWM can predict WLD behaviours over and above the TPB in a 
sample of adults over the age of 25. Second, it explores two aspects of ‘willingness’: willingness 
to eat unhealt hily socially and alone.  
Eating is often a social activity and there is good evidence to show how important social 
context s, and other people are to eating habits (Higgs & Thomas, 2016) , supporting the 
application of a model that takes into account social factors . In the PWM w illingness is usually 
measured by the creation of risk conducive social situations.  However, it may be that prototype perceptions also influence eating habits outside of these contexts.  Thus, it is of interest to 
explore whether prototype perceptions also in fluence willingness to eat alone.  
As far as the authors can ascertain, the current study is the first application of both the TPB and the PWM to an older (25+) adult population in relation to WLD . The PWM was designed for 
adolescents, however, a meta- analysis found that adult research provided similar results (Todd, 
Kothe, Mullan, & Monds, 2016) . 
Aims and hypothese s 
The purpos e of this paper was to explore the application of the PWM and TPB to WLD  in an 
adult population . The specific aims were to 1) to explore willingness to eat unhealthy foods 
socially or when alone and (2) if the PWM would predict WLD  status over and above the TPB.  
We hypothesized that prototype perceptions would explain more of the variance in willingness to eat socially than willingness to eat alone, given the assumed social nature of prototypes.  We also hypothesized that the PWM would be able to explain a greater proportion in WLD behaviour than the TPB.  
METHODS  
Participants and procedure  
6 
 Adults resident in the UK aged 25 and over were recruited through social media with invitations 
to partic ipate posted in weight loss/ dieting Facebook groups  and Twitter.  In total  192 people 
took part  (56% completion rate; 69% female; 93% white; median age 45 -54; 75% educated to 
degree level or higher; 77% employed; 66% living with a partner).  A cross- sectional 
anonymous survey was delivered using Qualtrics and measures were counterbalance d. The 
survey took approximately 15 minutes to complete and was approved by Oxford Brookes 
Psychology  Ethics Committee . 
Measures   
All survey measures can be seen in Appendix A.  
Theory of Planned Behaviour 
Following guidance on writing a  TPB questionnaire  (Francis et al., 2004) the following 
constructs were measured using seven  point scales; behavioural intentions ; attitudes; 
subjective norms; and PBC .  Each construct  was measured with a number of items which were 
summed to produce a single scale and tested for internal reliability : Intentions (6 items; α = 
.64); attitudes (8 items; α = .76); norms (7 items; α = .72); perceived behavioural control (3 
items; α = .51).  
Prototype Willingness Model  
Perceptions of slim and overweight prototypes were measured in line with previous research 
(Gibbons, Gerrard, & McCoy, 1 995) . Favourability was measured using 12 pairs of antonyms 
from previous studies (Blanton et al., 2001; Dalley & Buunk, 2009)  (e.g. 
Irresponsible/Responsible) which were rated on a seven point scale and summed ( slim 
prototype , 12 items; α = .83, overweight prototype; 12 items; α = .81). Similarity was measured 
by asking participant to rate th emselves on a seven  point scale from ‘Not at all similar/Very 
similar’  to each prototype.  Willingness to each unhealthy food socially or  alone was measured 
7 
 on a seven  point scale (1 -7, ‘Not willing/Very willing’)  using scenarios related to eating 
unhealthy food socially (8 items; α = .66) or alone (3 items; α = .81).  
Dieting and weight  
In line with previous research (Canpolat, Orsel, Akdemir, & Ozbay, 2005; Dalley & Buunk, 2009)  
WLD  status was measured with the Dieting Status Measure (DSM) (Strong & Huon, 1997).  
Participants ticked one of the six categories ranging from ‘Never dieted’ to Frequent dieter’ that 
they perceived best fitted their dieting behaviour, for example a ‘Trier’ (I have given it a go but never really got very far’).  Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using self -reported height and 
weight , this varies by 1 -3% from actual height and weight (Bowman & DeLucia, 1992) . Healthy 
food was defined in the survey based on NHS guideli nes of five portions of fruit and vegetables 
each day and choosing high fibre or wholegrain options  and limiting sugar and high fat foods . 
Unhealthy food was described as being high in sugar and fats and examples were given such as chips and cakes.  
RESULTS  
Missing data were dealt with using pairwise deletion. The dieting status scale was collapsed into 
three groups. “Triers” and “Ex -dieters” were included in the “Sometimes Dieters” group and 
“Often” and “Always” dieters formed the “Frequent Dieters” group.  The number of participants 
who had never dieted (ND) was 46; 107 participants fell into the sometimes dieters category (SD) and 34 participants into the frequent dieters category (FD).  There was a significant association between  sex and dieting status (χ2(2) = 13.81, p=.001), with a greater proportion of 
males in the ND group (40.4% of the males were in the ND group compared to 17.1 % of 
females), and a greater proportion of the females in the FD group (23.3% of females, compared 
to 10.7% of males; the SD group was more equal with 59.7% of females and 50.9% of males  in 
this category ).  However there were no significant differences between females and males on 
the main study measures after adjustments were made for multiple c ompariso ns, other than for 
8 
 favorability of and similarity to overweight p rototype.  Females (M=47.78, SD= 8.15) rated the 
overweight prototype significantly more favourably than males (M=43.13, SD= 7.62;  t(183) 
=3.62, p<.001). Females (M= 4.12, SD=1.84) rated themselves as significantly more similar to the overweight prototype than ma les (M=3.12, SD=1.45; t(132.96)=4.00, p<001.  
Means and standard deviations for the study measures for the whole sample are shown in Table 1. The BMI range was 16.64 -70.29 (M=25.51, SD=8.09): there were 4 participants in the 
underweight category, 92 in the normal weight category, 54 in the overweight category, and 31 in the obese category. Significant positive correlations were found between the overweight prototype favourability and similarity, overweight similarity and willingness to eat unhealthily alone and between slim prototype similarity and PBC (p<.01). Significant negative correlations were found between overweight prototype similarity and willingness to eat unhealthily socially , 
and between slim prototype similarity and willingness to eat unhealthily alone and between overweight prototype similarity and PBC (p<.01).  
[Insert Table 1]  
Each group was then compared on the main study measures (Table 2). There was a significant 
differ ence in  BMI across the three dieting statuses  (F(2,185)=4.57 p=.012 partial  η2=.047). 
Post -hoc tests revealed that there was no significant different between the SD and the FD, but 
the ND had a significantly lower BMI than the other two groups.  The groups  were different in 
how they rated the similarity of both prototypes.  ND were significantly more similar to the slim prototype (F(2,186)=6.95 p=.001 partial  η2=.069) than the other two groups.  SD and FD were 
significantly more similar to the overweight pr ototype (F(2,186)=10.16 p=.001 partial  
η2=.098).  The other differences were rendered non -significant once multiple comparisons 
were accounted for.  
There was no significant difference in willingness to eat unhealthy foods socially between the 
dieting grou ps (Table 2). However, there was a significant difference in willingness to eat 
9 
 unhealthy foods alone (F(2,185)=4.22 p =.016 partial  η2=.044).  Post -hoc tests revealed that 
there was no significant difference in willingness to eat unhealthy food alone between the FD 
and the ND. However, there was a significant difference in willingness to eat alone between the ND and the SD with the SD more willing to eat unhealthy foods when alone than the ND. However as above we must take account of the number of multiple comparisons when 
considering this finding.  
[Insert Table 2]  
Because willingness is conceptualized in the PWM as a social reaction variable, multiple linear regression was performed to determine if prototype favourability and similarity would predict willin gness to eat unhealthy food socially and willingness to eat unhealthy food alone (Table 2).  
While only similarity to the overweight prototype predicted willingness to eat unhealthy foods socially, willingness to eat unhealthy foods alone was predicted by overweight prototype 
favourability and similarity, as well as slim prototype similarity.  
[Insert Table 3]  
A multinomial logistic regression was conducted with dieting status as the outcome measure 
and frequent dieter as the reference category (Table 2).  Firstly, TPB measures were used as 
predictors of dieting status.  The resulting model was significant and correctly classified 59.8% of cases R
2=.152 (Cox & Snell) .177 (Nagelkerke) , χ2(10)=29.51,p =.001. Compared to frequent 
dieters, non -dieters had higher PBC (OR=1.20) and were more likely to be male (OR= .13). 
There were no differences between frequent dieters and sometimes dieters in this model, 
although intentions approached significance (p=.053).  
[Insert table 4]  
10 
 In the following regression (Table 3), PWM variables were added to the model. This model was 
significant and classified 64.7% of cases (R2 = .301 (Cox & Snell) .351 (Nagelkerke), χ2 (22)= 
60.89, p<.001). In this model, the TPB variable PBC was rendered non -significant . 
[Insert table 5]  
Compared to frequent dieters, non -dieters had higher levels of similarity to the slim prototype 
(OR = 2.10) and lower levels of similarity to the overweight prototype (OR= 0.62). Compared to frequent dieters, sometimes dieters had lower and lower levels of intentions (OR = 0.92). Sex 
did not contribute to this model.  
DISCUSSION  
The purpose of this paper was to explore the application of the PWM and T PB to WLD 
behaviours. The specific aims were to 1) to explore willingness to eat unhealthy foods socially 
or when alone and (2) if the PWM would predict WLD  status over and above the TPB.   
Frequent dieters had higher BMIs than non -dieters, supporting the need to explore ways of 
discouraging this behaviour.  The findings also suggest that ‘sometimes dieters’ may be more willing to eat unhealthy foods alone compared to ‘non -dieters’.  Some evidence points towards 
differences including ‘emotional eating’, ‘food fretting’ (worrying about what is eaten and guilt associations) and ‘social fare’ (eating less when in company than when alone) (Scherwitz & Kesten, 2005) .   These different eating styles could be incorporated into future exploration of 
the PWM.  I n the current study, only overweight prototype similarity predic ted willingness to 
eat unhealthy food socially, but both favourability and similarity to the overweight prototype predicted willingness to eat alone.    
As expected, males were more likely to be non -dieters than females.  However, theory based 
measures were able to add to the prediction of dieting status when sex was controlled for.  N on-
dieters had higher levels of PBC and were more likely to be male than frequent dieters. Studies 
11 
 that have used the TBP as a basis for interventions have not always yielded positive results, 
leading some to suggest that the TPB be ‘retired’ (Sniehotta et al., 2014).  In the current study, the addi tion of the PWM measures increased the amount of variance explained and classified a 
higher percentage of the cases. PBC was also rendered non- significant as a predictor of dieting 
status. In line with previous findings (Dalley & Buunk, 2009)  similarity to the overweight 
prototype predicted WLD  status, indicating that it may be identifying with an undesired self that 
motivates WLD . Thus, an individual identifying as similar to the overweight prototype  may 
behave in a way that will fulfill that self -image , which  may explain the paradox of frequent 
diet ing (van Lettow, de Vries, Burdorf, & van Empelen, 2014) .  
Targeting similarity to prototypes could be used to reduce  WLD behaviours. This is important to 
change because even perceiving oneself as overweight is associated with future weight gain 
(Robinson et al., 2015).  However, at present there are no uniform methods  of targeting 
prototypes within interventions (Davies, Martin, & Foxcroft, 2016) .  It is also important to avoid 
stigmatizing people who are overweight or obese (Hunger, Major, Blodorn, & Miller, 2015) , thus 
further research is needed to determine how the overweight prototype should be targeted in 
order to have a positive im pact on reducing frequent dieting behaviour. If ‘fear of fat’ is the 
primary motivator for frequent WLD  (Dalley & Buunk, 2009)  future experimental studies could 
investigate whether improving the favourability of the overweight prototype decreases the 
frequency of WLD .  It may be po ssible to alter prototype similarity by indirect means.  For 
example , this could be achieved by assisting individuals to reject societal ideas of thinness 
espoused by the media.  A systematic review found that media literacy interventions were able 
to redu ce shape and weight concerns in females and males (Le, Barendregt, Hay, & 
Mihalopoulos, 2017)  
Limitations to this study should be considered. As this is a cross sectional study, we cannot infer causality, and future research using a prospective design could be conducted. It may be beneficial to undertake further qualitative research to ascertain whether the characteristics 
12 
 used to measure prototype favourability are relevant. There was an uneven spread of 
participants in t he three dieting status, as well as an unequal number of males and females, and 
a larger sample size gained by better targeting of the different groups may have helped address this.  Further, as much research has previously highlighted, BMI can be a problematic means of 
determining poor health (Tomiyama, Hunger, Nguyen -Cuu, & Wells, 2016) . Prototype 
favourability did not significantly predict dieting status. This could be due to the use of self -
report questionnaires  which allow time for reflection and adjustments to initial reactions in line 
social desirability bias. Future studies could explore the model using implicit measures, as these 
may be more suitable for capturing heuristic reactions in risky health behaviou rs (Davies, 
Paltoglou, &  Foxcroft, 2017) . 
In conclusion, p rototype similarity predict ed dieting status.  Further prospective studies are 
needed to explore prototype perceptions in greater depth within in an obese/overweight 
frequent dieting population, as moderating similarity t o the overweight prototype may be a 
fruitful direction for developing interventions .

 Note – titles in square brackets were not presented as headings to participants. 
 [Attitudes to healthy eating:]  
 Guidelines from the NHS say that a healthy diet includes eating at least five portions of fruit and 
vegetables a day, choosing high fibre or wholegrain options and limiting the amount of sugary high fat foods we eat. Please read and complete the following about healthy e ating:  
 Eating healthy food is something which is

 When thinking about the foods that you choose to eat how much do you think about 
maintaining or reaching a healthy weight? Please read the following statement and indicate how 
you feel about it from 1 -7 on the following scale:

 [Assessment of prototypes:]  
 [Favourability]  
 Some of the questions below concern your images of particular people. What we are interested in here are your ideas about typical members of a particular group. For example we all have 
ideas about what typical movie stars are like or what the typical grandmother is like. When 
asked if we could describe one of these images, we might say that we think the typical movie 
star is pretty or rich, or that the typical grandmother is sweet and frail. We are not saying that 
all movie stars or all grandmothers are exactly alike, but rather that many of them share certain 
characteristics.
