Abstract
Background: Intervention effects observed in efficacy trials are rarely replicated when the interventions are broadly
disseminated, underscoring the need for more information about factors influencing real-life implementation and
program impact. Using data from the ongoing national implementation of an evidence-based HIV prevention program
[ F o c u so nY o u t hi nT h eC a r i b b e a n( F O Y C ) ]i nT h eB a h a m a s , this study examines factors influencing teachers ’patterns of
implementation, the impact of teachers ’initial implementation of FOYC, and subsequent delivery of the booster sessions
on students ’outcomes.
Methods: Data were collected from the 80 government elementary and 34 middle schools between 2011 and
2014, involving 208 grade 6, 75 grade 7, and 58 grade 8 teachers and 4411 students initially in grade 6 and
followed for 3 years. Student outcomes include HIV/AID S knowledge, reproductive health skills, self-efficacy,
and intention to use protection. Data from teachers includes implementation and modification of the curriculum,
attitudes towards the prevention program, comfort level with the curriculum, and attendance at training workshops.
Structural equation modeling and mixed-effect modeling analyses were applied to examine the impact of teachers ’
implementation.
Results: Teachers ’attitudes towards and comfort with the intervention curriculum, and attendance at the curriculum
training workshop had a direct effect on teachers ’patterns of implementation, which had a direct effect on student
outcomes. Teachers ’attitudes had a direct positive effect on student outcomes. Teachers ’training in interactive
teaching methods and longer duration as teachers were positively associated with teachers ’comfort with the
curriculum. High-quality implementation in grade 6 was significantly related to student outcomes in grades 6
and 7 post-implementation. Level of implementation o f the booster sessions in grades 7 and 8 were likewise
significantly related to subsequent student outcomes in both grades.
Conclusions: High-quality initial implementation of a prevention program is significantly related to better
program outcomes. Poor subsequent delivery of booster sessions can undermine the positive effects from
the initial implementation while strong subsequent d elivery of booster sessions can partially overcome poor
initial implementation.

Background
The field of HIV prevention is maturing from a pri-
mary focus on intervention development to one that
includes development and dissemination and imple-
mentation of effective interventions [1]. The many
challenges encountered in implementation in real
world settings result in a wide range of changes to the ori-
ginal intervention design (e.g., selectively implementing
program components, dropping core elements, substan-
tially altering the design) and/or implementation delivery
quality issues which impair program outcomes [2 –5].
Prevention programs implemented in schools outside
of efficacy trials are typically not implemented with
high quality [6].
Numerous studies across many fields have examined
factors influencing implementation of school-based pre-
vention programs and identified a range of factors which
appear to facilitate or impede teacher implementation
efforts: teacher training, program characteristics, teacher
characteristics, and organizational characteristics [7 –9].
Teacher/program provider training is well recognized as
an essential component of successful implementation of
prevention curricula [10, 11]. A number of teacher charac-
teristics have been found to predict the fidelity of imple-
mentation including teacher ’s favorable attitude towards
prevention programs [12], confidence in their ability to
teach prevention program and to affect student per-
formance [13], perception o f community ownership of
the program [14], and shorter duration of time as
teacher [15]. Organizational c haracteristics including
receptivity to the prevention program, support by the
principal or other school administrators, and the orga-
nization ’s readiness to implement new programs have
been shown to be related to fidelity of implementation
[7, 12]. Students ’engagement in the intervention cur-
riculum appears to promote teacher ’s implementation
fidelity [16]. While there is increasing recognition about
specific teacher- and school-level factors that influence
implementation of prevention programs, little is known
about how these factors interact and the complex ways
in which teachers ’attitudes and self-efficacy are influenced
by education, training, and school administrators ’support,
and the extent to which attitudes and self-efficacy influ-
ence program implementation and outcomes. In this
manuscript, “self-efficacy ”refers to teacher ’s beliefs about
his/her ability to implement the intervention curriculum;
teacher ’s“confidence ”is a more general measure of
teacher ’s belief in the inherent value of the intervention
curriculum if it is delivered appropriately. Teacher ’sc o n f i -
dence leads to self-efficacy.
Numerous implementation models, theories and frame-
works have been proposed to summarize factors at multiple
levels of the social organizational context that potentially
influence the process of the translating research-basedeffective intervention into practice [17 –19]. The explor-
ation, preparation, implemen tation and sustainment (EPIS)
framework provides a compre hensive conceptual model to
guide implementation researc h across the dissemination-
implementation-sustainment spectrum. The EPIS model
articulates variables that may play crucial roles at different
phases in the implementation process and their impact on
the ultimate success of intervention delivery. The model ex-
amines both the ideological and structural fit of the wider
environment (the “outer context ”elements) as well as the
local culture and climate and providers ’characteristics and
attitudes (the “inner context ”e lements) with regard to the
intervention as indicators or guides to moving the inter-
vention towards successful implementation [20]. EPIS em-
phasizes the significant role of sustained leadership and
ownership over new interventions, and ongoing support
and incentives for implementation as key to successful im-
plementation and long-term sustainability. In the present
study assessing the active implementation phase of
school-based delivery of an evidence-based sexual risk-
reduction intervention, we focus on the role of one subset
of“inner context ”factors, the “Individual adopter (i.e.,
teacher) characteristics ”. Specifically, we seek to under-
stand the relationships among the individual adopter char-
acteristics and how they influence the implementation of
the FOYC intervention. Our hypothesized conceptual
model was developed based on the empirical literature
[21] and the EPIS framework with a focus on the active
implementation phase and “inner context ”factors. We
hypothesize that teachers ’attitudes towards the interven-
tion and their comfort with the curriculum have a direct
positive effect on implementation, which in turn affects
student outcomes. Teacher ’s comfort is influenced by their
teaching experience, training, and student engagement.
Teachers ’initial implementation and subsequent delivery
of booster sessions have a direct effect on long-term stu-
dent outcomes.
FOYC is an evidence-based, life skills curriculum
designed to reduce risk taking behaviors related to
HIV/STI transmission and teen pregnancy. Woven
throughout FOYC is a decision making model that
provides guidance and practice in problem solving
with a focus on how to obtain factual information on
sexual health. FOYC was adapted from Focus on
Youth (FOY). FOY and Informed Parents and Children
Together (CImPACT) were selected to be part of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s“Diffusion of
Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) ”Portfolio. De-
tailed information about intervention activities are de-
scribed elsewhere [22, 23]. Longitudinal evaluations
showed that the intervention significantly increased
Bahamian youth ’sH I V / A I D Sk n o w l e d g e ,p e r c e p t i o n so f
their ability to use condoms, and condom-use intention
[24] with evidence of increased condom use [25].Wang et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:16 Page 2 of 13
Beginning in 2011, the FOYC curriculum was integrated
into the national Health and Family Life Education
(HFLE) curriculum and taught by grade 6 teachers among
all grade 6 youth in all government primary schools in
The Bahamas throughout the school year. The FOYC
curriculum consists of eight sessions (each averaging
45 min to 1.5 h in length). Subsequently as the youth
reached grade 7 and then grade 8, they received an annual
1-h booster session reviewing decision-making tools,
condom use skills and communication skills. Per standard
Ministry of Education (MOE) procedure, the grade 6,
grade 7, and grade 8 teachers had all been invited to
participate in teacher training workshops; for the grade 6
teachers, the training lasted for 1 to 4 days, while for the
grade 7 and grade 8 teachers, the training was 1 day.
Details of the teachers training are described in our recent
publications [23, 26].
National implementation of FOYC in The Bahamas
offers a unique opportunity to examine teachers ’pattern
of implementation over time and long-term program
outcome, which has not been addressed in our prior
analyses [23, 26]. Drawing on data gathered through four
waves of national implementation, this analysis addresses
three research questions: (1) To what extent did the
teachers implement the FOYC-booster program after
initial implementation of FOYC in grade 6?; (2) What
factors influenced the teachers ’patterns of imple-
mentation and what is the relationship between in-
fluencing factors?; and, (3) How does teachers ’initial
implementation of FOYC and subsequent delivery of
the booster sessions impact students ’outcomes in
grades 6, 7, and 8?
Methods
Study site
Beginning in 2011, 80 government elementary schools
and 34 government middle (junior high) schools in the
Commonwealth of The Bahamas participated in national
implementation of FOYC. The 80 schools are located on
14 of the major islands constituting The Bahamas, where
more than 98% of the population resides. The 80 partici-
pating elementary schools housed 208 grade 6 teachers;
the 34 middle schools housed 75 grade 7 teachers and
58 grade 8 teachers.
Recruitment procedure
Our local research team met several times with the dir-
ector of education of the Ministry of Education (MOE),
district superintendents, and school administrators to dis-
cuss this school-based research project at the beginning of
this study. Administrators from 117 government primary/
junior high schools were contacted and 114 provided writ-
ten approval of inclusion of their schools (97.4%). Our re-
search team partnered with the Health and Family LifeEducation (HFLE) unit of MOE to conduct FOYC training
workshops for teachers. All HFLE teachers were invited to
participate in the training and received information about
the research. Two hundred and sixty primary/junior high
school teachers were contacted; 251 (96.5%) provided
written consent to participate.
Measures
Implementation dose and fidelity of implementation
Grade 6 teachers were asked to complete a teacher
implementation checklist specific for each of the eight
sessions of FOYC after they had taught the session. The
checklist includes all 46 activities in the FOYC curricu-
lum, 30 of which were identified by the developers as “core
activities ”[i.e., those activities believed to be critical to the
effectiveness of the intervention [27]. The teachers indi-
cated which activities they had and had not taught in each
session. Implementation dose was defined as the number of
core activities (from among a total of 30) actually taught.
For those core activities that they taught, the teachers
recorded whether they had modified the format of the
activity as outlined in the manual to determine fidelity of
implementation. Student engagement (few, some, and
most) and level of comfort (not comfortable, rather com-
fortable, and very comfortable) in teaching each activity
were also recorded. Grade 7 and grade 8 teachers were
asked to complete teacher implementation checklist spe-
cific for each of the five core activities in the FOYC booster
session. The teachers indicated which activities they had
and had not taught; for those core activities that they
taught, the teachers recorded whether they had modified
the format of the activity, student engagement, and their
comfort level in teaching the activity.
Factors associated with implementation
At pre- and post-intervention delivery, all grade six partici-
pating teachers were asked to complete questionnaires
assessing factors described in the prior research as influen-
cing fidelity of intervention implementation. Information
was collected on teacher ’s level of formal education (associ-
ate degree, teaching certificate, bachelor degree, master
degree, doctoral degree), years as a teacher/guidance
counselor (1 –2y e a r s ,3 –5y e a r s ,5 –10 years, 10 –20 years,
>20 years), teacher ’s attendance at FOYC training workshop
(1 = did not attend, 2 = attended part of a training work-
shop, 3 = fully attended a train ing workshop), training in
interactive methods (1 = none, 2 = a little, 3 = some, 4 = a
lot), prior experience of teaching FOYC or other HIV
prevention programs (yes/no), teachers ’attitude towards
FOYC/HIV prevention intervention measured as their per-
ceptions of the importance of prevention programs, HIV
prevention and the FOYC intervention (1 = not important,
2 = somewhat important, 3 = very important), comfort level
with the FOYC curriculum (e.g., “how comfortable do youWang et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:16 Page 3 of 13
think you will feel in teaching the materials in FOYC? ”1=

and teacher ’ss e n s eo f “ownership ”of the curriculum [e.g., a
belief that the intervention addresses a local issue and re-
flects Bahamian values and i nput [7, 12]. The Cronbach ’s
alpha for perceptions of program importance (five items)
was 0.75.
Teachers ’patterns of initial implementation
(high/moderate/low implementers)
As reported previously [23], cluster analysis was used
to identify teachers ’patterns of implementation based
on implementation dose (i.e., number of core activ-
ities taught) and fidelity of i mplementation (i.e., per-
centage of core activities being changed during the
implementation). Results of the cluster analysis indi-
cated three distinct implementation clusters of teachers:
(1) high implementation group (63 teachers, 32%), charac-
terized by high levels of sustained implementation and fi-
delity of implementation. Teachers in this group taught
over 80% of core activities (25 out of 30 core activities) on
average and changed only 14% of the core activities;
(2) moderate implementation group (105 teacher, 53%),
showing moderate levels of sustained implementation
but high levels of fidelity of implementation. On aver-
age, teachers in this group taught less than half of
the core activities (12.3 out of 30 core activities) and
changed 13% of the core activities; and 3) low imple-
mentation group (31 teachers, 16%), demonstrating
low levels of sustained implementation and fidelity.
On average, these teachers taught less than one-third
of core activities (8.6 out of 30 core activities) and
changed three-quarters of the core activities that they
taught in the classroom.
Student outcomes
An anonymous curricular assessment instrument with
identifying information only at the level of the school
and classroom/teacher, adapted by the MOE from a
version of the Bahamian Youth Health Risk Behavioral
Inventory (BYHRBI) [22] was administered to grade 6,
grade 7, and grade 8 students. The instrument includes
a scale of 15 true/false statements to assess level of HIV/
AIDS knowledge ( “knowledge ”) (Cronbach ’sα= 0.85); a
six-item adaptation of the Condom-use Skills Checklist
(Cronbach ’sα= 0.83) [28] to assess condom-use know-
ledge and skills ( “reproductive health skills ”); a three-item
self-efficacy scale regarding pregnancy/STI prevention
methods ( “self-efficacy ”) (Cronbach ’sα= 0.81); and, one
question assessing the youth ’s likelihood of using a condom
if he/she were to engage in sexual intercourse within the
next 6 months ( “intention to use protection ”)[ f i v e - p o i n t
Likert scale ranging from 1 (very unlikely) through 5 (very
likely)].Analysis
Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of
HIV/AIDS knowledge, condom-use skills, self-efficacy,
and intention to use protection were calculated for whole
sample and stratified by teachers ’patterns of initial imple-
mentation (high/moderate/low implementers) at baseline,
and grade 6, grade 7, and grade 8 follow-ups. A line chart
was then constructed to graphically display the longitu-
dinal trends of mean scores of these student outcomes.
The difference in student outcomes across the four time
points were examined using ANOVA with Tukey honestly
significant difference (HSD) tests, using the whole sample
and stratified by the implementation group. The difference
in knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and intention across the
three implementation groups at each time point was
assessed using ANOVA. To examine the associations of
grade 7 and grade 8 teacher delivery of booster sessions
with grade 8 student outcomes, students ’knowledge,
skills, self-efficacy, and intentions were compared accord-
ing to their grade 7 and grade 8 teachers ’levels of imple-
mentation of the booster sessions (categorized into three
groups: taught 0 –1a c t i v i t y ,2 –3 activities or 4 –5 activities)
using ANOVA with the Tukey HSD post hoc tests.
Pearson (for continuous variables) and Spearman (for
ordinal variables) correlation analyses were conducted to
examine the associations between factors influencing
teacher ’s patterns of implementation and student out-
comes. The anonymous student questionnaires were not
linked at the level of the individual student; however, the
questionnaires were linked to the teacher (classroom).
Thus, we calculated average scores of student outcomes
for each teacher in correlation analyses.
We further examined the association of grade 6 teachers ’
patterns of implementation (high/moderate/low implemen-
ters) with grade 8 student outcomes using mixed-effects
modeling, adjusting for clustering effects of classroom
(teacher) and/or school. Independent variables included
teacher ’s implementation clusters, student ’sa g e ,s e x ,a n d
baseline student outcomes. School and class were included
as random effect variables in the model. Similarly, the effect
of grade 7 and grade 8 teacher delivery of booster sessions
on student outcomes was further assessed using mixed
effects models, controlling for clustering effects of class-
room and/or school and baseline difference.
To examine the effects of both the grade 6 teachers ’
implementation of the FOYC intervention and subsequent
delivery of the booster session in grade 7 and grade 8 on
long-term student outcomes in grade 8, we expanded the
mixed-effects models descr ibed above by including both
grade 6 teachers ’patterns of implementation and grade 7
and grade 8 teacher ’s level of implementation of booster
session in the same model. We further examined the rela-
tionship of different combinations/scenarios of grade 6 im-
plementation of FOYC (high/moderate/low implementers)Wang et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:16 Page 4 of 13
and grade 7 and grade 8 teacher ’s delivery of booster
session [poor (0 –3 activities)/fair (4 –7 activities)/good
(8–10 activities) delivery] wi th student outcomes using
mixed-effects models controlling for clustering effects and
baseline difference. All analyses were performed using SAS
9.4 statistical software pack age (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA).
Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was con-
ducted to examine the relationships among factors influ-
encing teacher ’s patterns of implementation, and student
outcomes using the Mplus 7 with multilevel add-on. A
starting model (implementation model) was estimated to
examine the interrelationships among factors influencing
teacher ’s patterns of implementation and their direct
and indirect effects on implementation patterns. Subse-
quently, a full model was constructed by including grade
6, grade 7, and grade 8 student outcome latent variables,
and implementation of grade 7 and grade 8 booster
sessions into the revised implementation model. Since
students were clustered within classes in 80 schools, the
cluster option in Mplus was used to correct for the poten-
tial underestimation of standard errors [29]. Standardized
regression coefficients for all paths were estimated using
robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimation. Missing
data was handled using full information maximum likeli-
hood (FIML). Goodness of model fit was assessed using
chi-square to degrees-of-freedom ratio ( χ2/df), root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA), Bentler ’sc o m -
p a r a t i v ef i ti n d e x( C F I )a n dT u cker Lewis Index (TLI) [30].
Standardized path coefficients were presented in Fig. 3.
Results
Study participants
Data were collected from 208 grade 6 teachers, 75
grade 7 teachers, 58 grade 8 teachers and 4411 grade
6 students at baseline; from 4,168 (94.5%) of all
grade 6 students at the g rade 6 follow-up; from
3,439 (78.0%) students at the grade 7 follow-up; and,
from 3256 (73.8%) students at the grade 8 follow-up.
The average age of the students at baseline was 10.4
(SD = 1.7) years. The vast majority (>95%) of stu-
dents are of African descent and about one-half are
female.
Teachers ’implementation of the booster sessions after
initial implementation of FOYC
Among the 75 grade 7 teachers who participated in the
national implementation study, 18 teachers taught 4 or 5
activities (from among 5 activities) in the booster ses-
sion, 29 taught 2 or 3 activities and 28 taught none or
only one activity. Among the 58 grade 8 teachers who
were involved in the current study, 27 teachers taught 4
or 5 activities in the booster session, 25 taught 2 or 3
activities and 6 taught none or only one activity.Changes in mean scores for HIV/AIDS knowledge,
reproductive health skills, self-efficacy, and intention to
use protection by three implementation groups
Figure 1 displays changes in the mean scores of HIV/
AIDS knowledge, reproductive health skills, self-efficacy
and intention to use protection over time according to
the implementation-level of the grade 6 teacher who
were categorized into three implementation groups: high
or moderate or low implementation. Overall, knowledge,
skills, self-efficacy and intention increased significantly
across the four time points for all three implementation
groups except that the increases in knowledge from
grade 6 follow-up to grade 7 follow-up were not signifi-
cantly different in the high and moderate implementation
g r o u p s .Al a r g ei n c r e a s ei nk n o w l e d g ei nt h eh i g ha n dm o d -
erate implementation gro ups occurred at the grade 6
follow-up; this increase resu lted in an upward displacement
of the curves for the two implementation groups. After the
grade 6 follow-up, the trajectories were relatively flat for the
high and moderate implementation groups, although their
upward displacement was reta ined throughout the follow-
up period. Reproductive health skills were higher among
students who had been taught by grade 6 high and moder-
ate implementation teachers than those with grade 6 low
implementation teachers at baseline and the grade 6 and
grade 7 follow-ups. At the grade 8 follow-up, the mean
difference in skills became statistically not significant. Com-
parable at baseline, self-efficacy and intention were higher
among students with grade 6 high and moderate imple-
mentation teachers than tho se with grade 6 low implemen-
tation teachers at the grade 6 an d/or grade 7 follow-ups; at
grade 8 follow-up there were no significant differences in
self-efficacy and/or intentions among the three implemen-
tation groups.
Effect of a brief FOYC-booste r program on grade 8 student
outcome according to grade 6 teacher FOYC implementation
patterns
Students ’HIV/AIDS knowledge, reproductive health
skills, self-efficacy and intention to use protection were
significantly associated with grade 8 teachers ’level of
implementation of the booster session (Table 1). Overall,
knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and intention were the
highest among youth whose teachers covered four to five
activities ( “good ”implementation) of booster session,
followed by youth whose teachers covered two to three ac-
tivities ( “fair”implementation), with youth whose teachers
did not teach or only taught one activity ( “poor ”imple-
mentation) of the booster session demonstrating the low-
est scores. In stratified analysis among youth whose grade
6t e a c h e r sw e r ei nt h e lowimplementation group, those
whose grade 8 teachers exhibited good and/or fair imple-
mentation of the booster compared to those whose grade
8 teachers exhibited poor implementation demonstratedWang et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:16 Page 5 of 13
greater increases in three of the four student outcomes in
grade 8 (knowledge: 10.8 vs. 10.3 vs. 9.6, F=5 . 4 1 , P<0 . 0 1 ;
skills: 4.6 vs. 4.3 vs. 4.2, F=3 . 8 2 , P= 0.023; self-efficacy:
2.0 vs. 1.9 vs. 1.4, F=4 . 8 8 , P< 0.01). Among youth whose
grade 6 teachers were in the moderate implementation
group, those whose grade 8 teachers exhibited good and/
or fair booster implementation compared to those whose
grade 8 teachers exhibited poor implementation demon-
strated greater increase in reproductive health skills and
intention (skills: 4.6 vs. 4.4 vs. 4.4, F=4 . 6 7 , p<0 . 0 5 ;
intention: 4.3 vs. 4.2 vs. 3.6, F=1 3 . 4 1 , P< 0.001). Among
youth whose grade 6 teachers were in the high implemen-
tation group, those whose grade 8 teachers exhibited poor
and/or fair booster implementation compared to those
grade 8 teachers who exhibited good implementation
demonstrated poorer reproductive health skills (skills: 4.4
vs. 4.4 vs. 4.6, F=4 . 8 8 , P<0 . 0 1 ) .
The results of the mixed-effects models indicate that
the quality of grade 6 teachers ’implementation was
significantly related to increased HIV/AIDS knowledge
and self-efficacy among grade 8 students (knowledge:
β= 0.37, SE = 0.19, p= 0.05; self-efficacy: β= 0.18, SE = 0.07,
p< 0.01). Changes in students ’reproductive health
skills and intention to use protection were not related
to grade 6 teacher implementation. In summary, youth
whose teachers belonged to the high implementationgroup demonstrated better student outcomes in grade 8
than those youth whose teachers were in the low imple-
mentation group (Additional file 1). Similarly, grade 7
teachers ’level of implementation of the booster ses-
sion was significantly related to grade 8 student im-
provements in HIV/AIDS knowledge and self-efficacy
(Additional file 2). The results of the mixed-effects
models show that grade 8 teachers ’level of imple-
mentation of the booster session was significantly re-
lated to grade 8 student improvements in reproductive
health skills, condom use self-efficacy, and intention to
use protections (skills: β= 0.24, SE = 0.08, p,0.01; self-
efficacy: β=0 . 2 2 , S E=0 . 0 7 , p<0 . 0 1 ; i n t e n t i o n : β=0 . 3 5 ,
SE = 0.11, p,0.001); the relationship of the students ’HIV/
AIDS knowledge with grade 8 teacher implementation of
the booster sessions was marginally significant (Additional
file 3).
Effects of grade 6 teacher ’s initial implementation of
FOYC intervention and grade 7 and 8 teacher ’s delivery
of booster session on long-term student outcomes
Table 2 presents the relationship of different combina-
tions of grade 6 implementation of FOYC and grade 7
and grade 8 delivery of the booster sessions with student
outcomes. Compared to youth whose grade 6 teachers
belonged to the low implementation group and whose
Fig. 1 Change in HIV/AIDS knowledge, reproductive health skills, self-efficacy, and intention to use protection from baseline to 24-month follow-up,
stratified by grade 6 teacher implementation clusterWang et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:16 Page 6 of 13
grade 7 and grade 8 teachers exhibited poor booster im-
plementation ( “poor-performing teachers ”), youth whose
grade 6 teachers belonged to the high or moderate im-
plementation groups and whose grade 7 and grade 8
teachers exhibited good or fair booster implementation
performed better in three of the four student outcomes
(including HIV/AIDS knowledge, reproduction health
skills and self-efficacy). Presence of poor-performing
teachers in either grade 6 or in grade 7 and/or 8 were
mitigated by better performing teachers in the alternate
year(s). Thus, compared to youth with poor-performing
teachers in grades 6, 7 and 8, youth whose grade 6
teachers belonged to the high or moderate implementa-
tion groups butwhose grade 7 and grade 8 teachers exhib-
ited poor booster implementation performed better in
HIV/AIDS knowledge only; youth whose grade 6 teachers
were in the low implementation group but whose grade 7
and grade 8 teachers exhibited good or fair booster imple-
mentation performed better in HIV/AIDS knowledge
only. Youth whose grade 6 teachers belonged to the high
or moderate implementation groups and whose grade 7
and grade 8 teachers exhibited good or fair booster imple-
mentation demonstrated better long-term student out-
comes than youth whose grade 6 teachers were in the lowimplementation group and whose grade 7 and grade 8
teachers exhibited poor booster implementation.
Bivariate correlation among factors influencing
implementation and student outcomes
Grade 6 teacher ’s level of comfort with the FOYC curricu-
lum, attitudes towards the intervention, attendance of
FOYC training workshop were positively associated with
teacher implementation cluster ( r= 0.24~0.34, p<0 . 0 1 ) .
Teacher ’s level of comfort with FOYC was positively asso-
ciated with attitudes towards FOYC, training in interactive
teaching and years as teacher ( r= 0.20~0.34, p<0 . 0 1 ) . I n
addition, training in interactive teaching was positively as-

An initial hypothetical model was developed based on a
synthesis of the empirical literature (Fig. 2). The model
posits that teachers ’attitudes towards the intervention
(i.e., perception of the importance of FOYC) and their
levels of comfort with delivering the FOYC lessons have
a direct positive effect on implementation patterns
(high/moderate/low implementers), which in turn affect
student outcomes. Teacher ’s level of comfort is influencedTable 2 Mixed-effects models assessing the effects of different combinations of grade 6 teacher ’s implementation of FOYC

by whether they received training in the delivery of the
FOYC curriculum and/or interactive teaching, perceived
student engagement in FOYC, and their duration as a
teacher. Teachers ’attendance at the FOYC training work-
shop is also hypothesized to have a direct effect on their
implementation. Estimation of this model revealed a sig-
nificant chi-square statistic and unacceptable CFI and TLI
values (close to 0.80). In modifying the initial model, we
eliminated two nonsignificant paths including the paths
from student engagement in FOYC and attendance at
FOYC training to teachers ’level of comfort with FOYC.
The revised model was then estimated and revealed ac-
ceptable model fit. This revised implementation model
was expanded into a full model by including student out-
comes and grade 7 and grade 8 booster session. In modify-
ing the full model, we eliminated one nonsignificant path
from teachers ’implementation quality in grade 6 to grade
8 student outcome and added a path from teachers ’atti-
tudes towards FOYC (perception of the importance of
FOCY) to grade 6 student outcome. Self-efficacy as one of
the four indicators for the student outcome latent variable
was removed due to low factor loadings (ranging from
0.28 to 0.38). The overall fit of the revised model was
good. The chi-square/df ratio was 1.67, the RMSEA was
0.06, the CFI was 0.93, and the TLI was 0.91.
The revised structural model demonstrated relation-
ships among factors and their direct and indirect effect on
implementation patterns and student outcomes (Fig. 3).
There were four manifest exogenous variables, two mani-
fest endogenous (i.e., comfort level and implementation
cluster) and three latent endogenous variables (e.g.,
student ’s outcomes in grade 6, 7 and 8) in the model. In
the final model, teachers ’attitudes towards the interven-
tion, comfort level with the FOYC curriculum and attend-
ance of FOYC training predicted high quality of
implementation, which in turn predicted better student
outcomes (HIV/AIDS knowledge, reproductive health
skills, and intention to use protection). More years as ateacher or guidance counselor and training in interactive
teaching were positively associated with teachers ’level of
comfort with FOYC. In addition, teacher ’s perception of
the importance of the FOYC intervention had a direct
positive effect on grade 6 student outcomes. Grade 6
student outcome, teachers ’implementation cluster and
grade 7 teachers ’delivery of booster session predicted
grade 7 student outcome. Grade 7 student outcome and
grade 8 teachers ’delivery of booster session predicted
grade 8 student outcome. The analysis revealed an R2
value of 0.20 for implementation cluster and of 0.30, 0.41,
and 0.52 for grade 6, grade 7, and grade 8 student out-
comes, respectively.
The Sobel test of mediation effect indicated that im-
plementation cluster mediated the relationship between
teacher ’s level of comfort with the FOYC curriculum
and student ’s outcome ( z= 2.51, p< 0.05). In addition,
the Sobel test suggested that grade 6 implementation
quality partially mediates the relationships between
teachers ’attitudes towards the intervention and student
outcome ( z= 3.21, p< 0.01).
Discussion
The current study examined the interrelationships among
multiple program provider-level factors and how these
processes influence teachers ’patterns of implementation
(measured by high/moderate/low implementation clus-
ters) of an evidence-based sexual risk reduction program
in 80 government elementary schools and 34 government
middle schools in The Bahamas across 30 months of
follow-up. We also assessed the impact of initial imple-
mentation and subsequent delivery of the booster sessions
on long-term program outcomes. We found that several
provider-level factors were associated with implementa-
tion patterns, and high-quality initial implementation was
significantly related to short-term program outcomes.
Level of implementation of the booster sessions was sig-
nificantly related to subsequent student outcomes. BothFig. 2 Hypothesized structural model of relationships among factors that influence teachers ’quality of implementation and long-term
student outcomesWang et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:16 Page 10 of 13
initial implementation and subsequent delivery of booster
sessions are of critical importance in achieving long-term
program outcomes.
Several teacher-level factors were found to be signifi-
cantly related to teachers ’initial implementation of FOYC.
Consistent with previous research [10, 12, 16], we found
that teachers ’attitudes towards the prevention program,
their comfort level with the intervention curriculum, and
teachers ’attendance at curriculum training workshop are
strong predictors of the teacher ’sq u a l i t yo fi m p l e m e n t a -
tion (defined by high degrees of implementation and fidel-
ity of implementation). Higher levels of comfort among
teachers with the curriculum may lead to greater confi-
dence in their ability to conduct the intervention sessions
(including sensitive topics such as condom use, teen preg-
nancy and sexual harassment/abuse) in the classroom.
Teachers who hold favorable attitudes towards the inter-
vention perceive the importance of HIV prevention in
schools, and thus they are more likely to implement more
sessions without significantly modifying the format of the
activity. Teachers who attended curriculum training work-
shops were more familiar with the contents of the inter-
vention curriculum and acquired interactive teaching
skills. Further, teachers ’attendance at training workshops
may reflect positive attitudes towards the prevention pro-
gram. Teachers ’comfort with the intervention curriculum
also demonstrated a significant mediating effect on the
relationship between training in interactive teaching
methods and implementation fidelity. Inconsistent with
previous studies [16], our study did not find significant as-
sociation between student engagement in the intervention
curriculum and teachers ’quality of implementation. This
could be caused by small variation in teachers ’reports of
student engagement (as the vast majority of teachers said
“most ”students were engaged in the lessons). Teachers ’
attitudes towards a prevention program, self-efficacy in
teaching intervention curriculum and skills in interactive
teaching are potential modifiable factors related toprogram delivery [7]. Therefore, pre-implementation
teacher training should place greater emphasis on enhan-
cing teachers ’competency in teaching the intervention
curriculum, shaping teachers ’belief about the importance
of HIV prevention, and demonstrating and reinforcing
the use of interactive methods in the context of pre-
vention programs.
Both teachers ’initial implementation of FOYC and
subsequent delivery of the booster sessions are related to
students ’outcomes. As previously reported [23, 26], high
quality of initial implementation (characterized by high
levels of implementation and fidelity of implementation)
was significantly related to all four student outcomes
6 months after intervention implementation and related
to two student outcomes (HIV/AIDS knowledge and
intention to use protection) 18 months after initial im-
plementation. Data in the present study indicate that the
quality of initial implementation had little impact on
long-term student outcomes (e.g., 30 months after im-
plementation, it was only significantly related to student
self-efficacy). The level of implementation of the booster
session in grade 8 was significantly related to three stu-
dent outcomes (reproductive health skills, self-efficacy
and intention to use protection). Simultaneous examin-
ation in the mixed-effects model of the effects of grade 6
initial implementation of FOYC and grade 7 and grade 8
delivery of the booster sessions on student outcomes re-
vealed that high quality of initial implementation com-
bined with good delivery of the booster sessions resulted
in improvements in three outcomes (knowledge, skills
and self-efficacy) whereas high quality of initial imple-
mentation combined with poor delivery of the booster
sessions only resulted in improvement in one outcome
(knowledge) in comparison to poor quality of initial im-
plementation and poor delivery of booster sessions.
These findings suggest that the effect of initial imple-
mentation on long-term program outcome is fading
without quality delivery of booster program, whichFig. 3 Revised structural model showing relationships among factors that influence fidelity of implementation and long-term student outcomes
(including HIV/AIDS knowledge, condom use skills and intention to use protection). (Model fit: CFI = 0.930; TLI = 0.907; RMSEA = 0.058; Chi-Square/
DF = 1.67). R2value for grade 6, grade 7, and grade 8 student outcomes is 0.30, 0.41, and 0.52, respectivelyWang et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:16 Page 11 of 13
highlights the importance of the FOYC-booster program
after the intervention implementation.
While longitudinal trends of mean scores for know-
ledge, skills, self-efficacy, and intention show consistent
increases for all three implementation groups, trajectory
patterns of HIV/AIDS knowledge show that the in-
creases in knowledge from the grade 6 follow-up to the
grade 7 follow-up were not significantly different in the
high and moderate implementation groups. This lack of
difference may be because the high and moderate imple-
mentation groups gained large increase in knowledge
during the grade 6 implementation phase, e.g., there was
a“ceiling effect ”for knowledge for both groups between
grade 6 and grade 7 follow-ups.
Several potential limitations should be noted in this
study. First, our findings were based on teachers ’and
students ’self-reports, which are subj ect to social desirability
and recall bias. It is possible that teachers over-reported
their level of implementation of the intervention curricu-
lum and booster sessions and provided responses that they
thought would be more appropriate (as teachers were
expected to teach the intervention curriculum as integrated
components of Health and Fam ily Life Education class). In
the current study, trained observers independently ob-
served and assessed approximately 20% of each teacher ’s
classes and booster sessions. We compared the teacher and
observer reports on activities taught in these sessions and
found that the teacher-obser ver agreement was high (over
80%), indicating that teacher ’s self-reports are reliable [31].
Second, typical of many studies of this kind, there was rela-
tively high attrition rate (i.e., about 20%) to grade 7 follow-
up. The major reasons for attrition in grade 7 included stu-
dents ’non-identification of the ir grade 6 teachers in the
grade 7 follow-up survey and loss of contact due to stu-
dents ’graduation from primary sch o o la n dt r a n s f e r r i n gi n t o
non-government middle schools (private or religious-based
schools) [26]. Third, most (75 %) middle school teachers did
not implement all the activities in the booster session,
which might compromise long-term effect of the interven-
tion. Incomplete implementation of the booster session
may reflect several factors. For example, middle school
teachers may be reluctant to r educe time from academic
subjects that are assessed thr ough national exams; currently
HIV prevention is not included in the middle school
national exams. As well, the middle school training for
FOYC is substantially shorter than is the training for elem-
entary school teachers. In the absence of equally intensive
training, the teachers may not perceive HIV prevention
among middle adolescents as being a priority area relative
to its importance among elementary school students.
Teacher ’s training workshops for the middle schools may
need to place additional emphasis on the importance of
HIV risk reduction among mid dle adolescents. Fourth,
although the literature emphasizes the importance ofteachers ’self-efficacy and confidence regarding their ability
to implement the program on their actual performance, we
did not collect these measures from the teachers. However,
we did measure teachers ’comfort level with the FOYC cur-
riculum, which we believe is a close proxy for teacher self-
efficacy and confidence. Finally, school-level factors such as
support by the principal or school administrators ’percep-
tion of importance of HIV prevention were only collected
from about half of the participating schools. Thus, these
data were not included in the present analysis.
Conclusions
This study provides an integrated understanding of the
relationships between teacher characteristics, training
experience and perceptions with quality of implementa-
tion, teachers ’subsequent delivery of boost sessions, and
long-term student outcomes. This study expands our
understanding of the complex ways in which teachers ’
attitudes and confidence are influenced by their training
and teaching experience, and influence quality of imple-
mentation and program outcome. These findings have
significant implications for future implementation efforts
in school settings. First, given that teachers ’attitudes to-
wards the prevention program and their levels of com-
fort with the curriculum are the most influential factors
on quality of implementation, it is important that
teacher pre-implementation training workshop focus on
strengthening teachers ’self-efficacy to implement the
intervention curriculum with high quality, and enhan-
cing positive beliefs about and promoting positive atti-
tudes towards the prevention program. Second, the brief
booster sessions delivered one and two years after the
initial implementation demonstrated significant effects
on student outcomes, suggesting that booster sessions
are important to maintain the long-term program out-
come. The quality of booster implementation can signifi-
cantly impact student outcomes, indicating the critical
importance of ongoing teaching training and technical
assistance with the booster program after initial
implementation.
