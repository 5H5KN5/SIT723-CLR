Abstract 
Background: Playlist for Life is a brief, inexpensive music listening intervention which originated in dementia care, 
but is increasingly being used for people at the end of life. However, there is a lack of robust empirical research on its 
application in the hospice setting. Our patient and public involvement group originated the idea for this study. The 
aim of this feasibility study was to inform the design of a larger effectiveness study on the use of Playlist for Life in the 
hospice setting.
Method: This study was a mixed-methods feasibility study involving adults at the end of life, family members and 
hospice staff from one in-patient hospice in Scotland. Eligible patient/family member dyads were approached by 
hospice staff and if interested, recruited by the researcher. All included participants received the intervention, which 
involved the provision of an MP3 player and assistance to set up a playlist. Participants were asked to listen to the 
playlist daily during the intervention period (7 days). Data were collected through patient reported outcome meas-
ures and on days 1, 3 and 7 of the intervention period and through participant observation session. Patient/family 
member dyads and hospice staff also took part in qualitative interviews (Appendix 1) post-intervention, which were 
audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Semi-structured interviews at the end of the intervention 
period were used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. An advisory group including patients, family members and 
staff gave helpful feedback on the qualitative interview questions. Interview questions were the same for all partici-
pants and all the questions were asked to all participants.
Results: N = 15 participants were recruited (n = 5 patients, n = 5 family, n = 5 staff. The intervention was appraised 
positively, particularly regarding its beneficial effect on patient/family relationships. The study design was deemed 
feasible and acceptable.
Conclusion: The findings of this study will inform the development of a future randomised cluster trial designed to 
assess the usability and effectiveness of the Playlist for Life personalised music intervention.
Trial registration: This study was not registered as this was a small feasibility study, conducted prior to a pilot study 
not testing for effectiveness. In addition, the study was non-randomised. The study is registered with NHS ethics and 
the hospice research and governance team

Background
In Scotland, around 54,000 people die every year and 
over 200,000 people are particularly affected by the death 
of significant individuals. In general, the deaths occur 
in older age, sometimes accompanied by frailty, demen -
tia and multiple other conditions. It is estimated that 
by 2037 the number of people dying each year will have 
risen by 12% to 61,600. It is estimated that up to 8 out 
of 10 individuals who die have needs that would benefit 
from the provision of palliative care [1]. A key aim of pal -
liative and end of life care is to ensure holistic care and 
support is aligned to the needs and preferences of the 
dying person, their families and carers [2].
This study originated from discussion with our public 
involvement group and clinical partners. The group has 
been strongly supportive of the Playlist for Life interven -
tion which is based on individuals’ personal history and 
music preferences, and the wider need to build a rigor -
ous evidence base for interventions employed in end of 
life care [3–9]. Playlist for Life is a brief and inexpensive 
music-based intervention that can promote shared con -
nections, personhood and legacy. It is an intervention 
founded by the writer and TV presenter Sally Magnus -
son in memory of her mother, Mamie. When Mamie 
lost her memory, Sally found that personally meaningful 
music helped improve Mamie’s quality of life more than 
anything else. Playlist for Life is based on the idea that 
sharing personalised musical experiences can promote 
communication and enrich the bond between the per -
son receiving care and their loved ones [10, 11]. Although 
the origins are in dementia care, Playlist for Life has 
been introduced within inpatient hospice and hospital 
settings to support people at the end of life and to sup -
port patients and their families at the end of life, as well 
as help relieve anxiety, distress, pain and other physical 
symptoms [2, 12, 13].
Everyone has a soundtrack of their life: special songs 
and music that bring back memories. Listening to these 
can help to coordinate neural activity [14]. The synthe -
sis of music, emotion and autobiographical memories 
within the pre-frontal cortex appears to improve mood, 
promote awareness and support memory retrieval and 
personhood [2, 13]. Indeed it is suggested, in dementia, 
the brain continues to interpret and understand musical 
input when other areas of functional ability have deterio -
rated [15].
Music therapy and listening to music are two tech -
niques which come under the broad theme of music 
interventions. Music therapy requires specific training for music therapists and theoretical–methodological support 
and focuses on the role of music elements in the relation -
ship between the patient and the therapist. However, lis -
tening to music is not based on a relationship between 
patient and music therapist [16]. While both interven -
tions can be person centred, music therapy requires an 
accredited and qualified professional to undertake music 
intervention sessions which can be live and improvised 
involving a wide range of music styles [16]. Conversely, 
listening to music involves sessions using purposefully 
chosen pre-recorded songs or tracks [17]. Additionally, 
listening to music, as with the Playlist for Life interven -
tion, can be repeated and the song list kept and reused as 
desired. Playlist for Life can be described as a more relax -
ing method of music intervention as research has found 
music listening, compared to music therapy, offers the 
comfort of hearing familiar songs and the security of lis -
tening through headphones enabling the person to solely 
concentrate on the audio [18]. Moreover, a crossover 
study on the effect of music interventions (listening to 
music and music therapy) on behavioural and psycholog -
ical symptoms of dementia has reported that comparing 
listening to music and music therapy showed no signifi -
cant statistical differences [16].
Our focus was on the personalised nature of the inter -
vention (i.e. music of the person’s own choosing that con -
nects with, or speaks to, memorable moments in their 
lives or aligns with their musical preferences) and the 
quality and impact of the shared interaction that occurs 
between the person and their family member when using 
Playlist for Life together. Underpinning this, and in con -
trast to much existing research, was a unique focus on 
the role of Playlist for Life, where we were interested in 
enhancing personhood and legacy for people at the end 
of life.
Overall, research into personalised music intervention 
is in its infancy but seminal work within dementia care 
points to its value in enhancing life quality and stimu -
lating autobiographical memory [19–25]. Listening to 
music evokes vivid and emotional memories of events 
from across the lifespan by activating the limbic sys -
tem. More recent evidence demonstrated that songs are 
strongly linked to memories of a person, period, or place 
[21–25]. Previous literature highlighted cited benefits 
were enhanced mood, increased awareness of other peo -
ple and surroundings, improved cognitive capacity and 
a greater sense of identity and independence [26–28]. 
Moreover, another study for older adults with dementia 
and symptoms of agitation based on the individualised Keywords: Feasibility study, End-of-life care, Music, Palliative care, Hospice

music protocol of Gerdner and colleagues’ highlighted 
that agitation was decreased while participants were lis -
tening to music compared to times when they were not 
listening to music [29, 30]. Other advantages are that lis -
tening to music is low cost, is relatively straightforward 
to deliver, and is sustainable over the longer term, indica -
tors that translate well for wider use [31]. Clinical studies 
have demonstrated the effectiveness of music interven -
tions in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety 
for people who are approaching end of life [32–39]. Fur -
thermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis results 
showed that music therapy had an overall medium-to-
large effect on stress-related outcomes [40]. Another 
systematic review on music intervention in palliative and 
end-of-life care emphasised that music intervention has 
indicated significant benefit in respect to psychological, 
physiological and social responses [41–43]. In addition, 
a recent Cochrane review examining music interven -
tions for improving psychological and physical outcomes 
in patients with cancer identified that listening to music 
alleviated pain, and music interventions had beneficial 
effects on a range of symptoms and physiological mark -
ers such as depression and anxiety [17]. Other studies 
suggested some evidence for music in pain relief [36]. 
Current evidence indicates, however, that there is a lack 
of robust evaluation of evidence-based music interven -
tions using specific measures designed for the terminally 
ill and which evaluate specific music modalities in par -
ticular settings across multiple sessions [7, 44, 45].
To date, there has been no empirical research dem -
onstrating whether, and in what ways, patient and carer 
participation in Playlist for Life has an impact on patients 
with palliative care needs at the end of life [46, 47]. Our 
principal objective was to undertake feasibility work 
to determine the acceptability of Playlist for Life imple -
mentation in the hospice setting. The findings of this 
proposed study can establish whether Playlist for Life is 
a feasible and acceptable intervention for people at the 
end of their life and their families and can help to inform 
the design and evaluation of Playlist for Life in a future 
definitive randomised controlled trial.
Methods
Study aims
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibil -
ity and acceptability of Playlist for Life for adults at the 
end of life, family members and hospice staff in the hos -
pice setting in Scotland.
Objectives were to (i) determine the most acceptable 
and appropriate format for patient/carer delivery of the 
Playlist for Life intervention within the context of pallia -
tive and end of life hospice-based care, (ii) assess whether 
our research questions for the qualitative component provide rich, descriptive data on participant experi -
ence, and (iii) identify whether this study is acceptable to 
develop a standardised intervention package that is suita -
ble for implementation in a future randomised controlled 
trial.
Study design and procedure
This study was a single-arm, non-controlled, mixed-
methods feasibility study and an embedded qualita -
tive study underpinned by the pragmatic paradigm [48]. 
We followed the Consort reporting guideline [49] and 
MORE CARE statement [50] for developing research 
interventions in end of life care. Feasibility studies pro -
vide a valuable contribution to research, the results can 
prove useful benchmarks in the subject area regardless of 
meeting the original objectives [51]. Given that our aim 
was to evaluate feasibility of the intervention and given 
the nature of the vulnerability of study participants, all 
participants involved (adults at the end of life, family 
members and hospice staff) participated in the interven -
tion for an average of 48 days, with no follow-up beyond 
that. Recruitment was non-coercive and potential par -
ticipants were not approached by the researcher, instead 
hospice staff approached and introduced the project to 
the participants. Participants were asked to complete 
selected patient reported outcome measures (Integrated 
Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) [52], Hospital Anxi -
ety and Depression Scale (HADS) [53] and Personalised 
Music Assessment Tool [54]) at three different intervals, 
once before the intervention as a baseline, one on day 
3 and one after the final session on day 7. Participants 
were observed by the researcher three times during the 
intervention in addition to a qualitative interview. The 
purpose of the observational component was to observe 
fidelity to the intervention and to observe the nature of 
patient and family member interaction/responsiveness 
to the setting up of, and listening together to the playlist, 
and to the nature of response to the personalised music 
intervention. The nature of observation was discreet but 
not covert, that is, the researcher adopted the role of 
observer allowing them to sit within the room.
Any effect of the intervention was assessed by the 
change in outcome in relation to the baseline data. There -
fore, participation time was a total of nine hours plus the 
qualitative interview over the study period. Involvement 
in the study was approximately 48 days from consent to 
final contact with the study team and all study interviews 
were conducted in a private room. We also recorded any 
changes in medications being used for pain, anxiety or 
distress during the intervention period.
A topic guide was developed in conjunction with our 
Patient and Public Involvement partners during the 
developmental and modelling stage to provide a level of 
Page 4 of 14 Johnston et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:32 
structure to the qualitative interviews (Appendix 1). The 
guide was based on the research questions and aimed to 
ensure consistency between participants.
Participants and setting
Participants were recruited in one hospice setting from 
April 2019 to March 2020 by clinicians in the participat -
ing hospice who received study information and agreed 
to participate. Eligible participants were (1) hospice inpa -
tient or day hospice patient with family member/friend 
interested in participating in Playlist for Life (for the pur -
poses of this study, family is defined as whomever the 
patient identifies as family, including friends, caregivers 
or faith or spiritual care leaders); (2) English as a first lan -
guage; (3) cognitively intact and able to consent to inter -
vention; and (4) prognosis > 7 days. Exclusion criteria 
were (1) significant confusion/delirium, (2) rapid physi -
cal deterioration, (3) expressed no interest in taking part 
in the Playlist for Life intervention and (4) prognosis ≤ 7 
days.
Intervention
Participants recruited from the hospice were inpatients 
or day care patients (aged 18 and over with English being 
their first language), with the aim of recruiting an equal 
number from both participant groups. A staff member 
and a family member were present when the patient lis -
tened to the Playlist. Together with a family member, 
the participant chose music tracks that they wished to 
hear, and a unique personal music playlist was set up on 
a mp3 player. Music covered many different music gen -
res from easy listening to rock. Most participants chose 
a combination of genres from different decades of their 
lives. A staff member from the hospice was trained in 
Playlist for Life 1 day training package (provided by Play -
list for Life charity) with a protocol based on Gerdner 
[29] and facilitated the setting up of the Playlist on the 
mp3 player. Hospice staff helped participants to create a 
unique personal music list by facilitating song choice and 
documenting them. Hospice staff had a key role in pro -
viding person-centered music listening intervention and 
helping with processing of emotions for each participant. 
An important part of the training is around recognising 
‘Red Flag’ songs, songs which bring a negative emotional 
response. These are not put on the individuals’ playlist as 
per the Gerdner protocol [29].
The participant and family member engaged in discus -
sion and exploration to discover the autobiographical 
memories and emotional connections the participant had 
for the selected songs or pieces of music. A notebook was 
provided for the dyad to document this dialogue. Gift 
boxes were provided by the research team to the hospice 
to present the music player, playlist and notebook to the participants’ family following the participants’ comple -
tion of their involvement in the study.
Compilation of the playlist involved 2 activities: (i) 
gathering music preferences for the unique personal 
playlist from each participant and, (ii) exploring and dis -
covering autobiographical memories and emotional con -
nections for the songs or pieces of music.
Each activity comes with an estimated time of 1–2 
hours (comprising of several short interactions if 
required depending on fatigue/other symptoms). Aspects 
and issues arising from the above around ease of use, 
potential challenges and barriers to setting up Playlist for 
Life was assessed as part of the feasibility study.
The average length of time participants were in the 
study was 48 days (range 28–84 days). On each day of the 
7-day intervention period participants and family mem -
ber/friends listened together to 30 min of their own play -
list. The average total listening time of the intervention 
was 3.5 hours over 1 week. The post-intervention inter -
views with participants and family members were con -
ducted at a suitable time for the dyad following the 7-day 
listening session.
The setting up of the Playlist and listening sessions were 
assessed through participant observation and patient 
reported outcome measures which were completed 
throughout the 7 days of the intervention period. There 
were three observed sessions within the intervention 
period. The discussion of the setting up of the playlist was 
observed, as well as two listening sessions. Participants 
were asked to complete the patient reported outcome 
measures at three different times, one before the inter -
vention as a baseline, one on day 3 and one after the final 
session on day 7.
Feasibility and acceptability of Playlist for Life
To evaluate feasibility and acceptability, the patient 
reported outcome measures (PROMs) included Inte -
grated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) [52], Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale [53] and Personal -
ised Music Assessment Tool [54].
Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS) is a tool 
which measures the symptoms and concerns of people 
receiving palliative care. This tool can be used in clini -
cal care, audit, research and training. IPOS has 17 items 
which measure the following dimensions in advanced 
illness: physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual and 
provision of information and support [52].
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
assesses anxiety and depression in a general medical pop -
ulation of patients. It includes 14 questions to evaluate 
depression and anxiety, seven of the questions relate to 
Page 5 of 14
 Johnston et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:32 
 
depression and seven relate to anxiety and takes 2–5 min 
to complete [53].
Personalised Music Assessment Tool (PMAT) includes 
5 items which capture the impact of the playlist on pain, 
personal care, eating and drinking, communication, med -
ication and mood [54].
In view of the potential burden to participants, the 
PROMS were chosen on the basis of stakeholder assess -
ment and are validated for use with people at the end of 
life. They were chosen based on ease and speed of admin -
istration as well as the suitability of the patient reported 
outcome measures to answer the research questions.
Qualitative data were collected from participant obser -
vation sessions and qualitative semi structured inter -
views post-intervention. These were audio-recorded, 
transcribed and analysed thematically. Listening sessions 
were observed by the same researcher. Questions were 
developed by the research team with the aim of eliciting 
an understanding of participants perceptions in partici -
pating in the Playlist for Life intervention, experienced 
barriers related to the intervention, and suggestions for 
refinement of the intervention processes (Appendix 1).
In addition, the researcher kept a journal throughout 
data collection documenting each playlist choosing ses -
sion/listening session 1/listening session 2 and after the 
qualitative interviews. Process issues related to the quali -
tative components of the study were documented in the 
journal reflect on any pertinent issues for future sessions. 
This included researcher observations and subjective 
experience relating to the researcher role in the study. 
Field notes were also kept within the diary, providing 
additional contextual data and an audit trial of the data 
collection.
Recruitment and retention
The recruitment and retention rates were calculated 
at the hospice based on: the number of participants 
assessed as clinically eligible to take part; the number 
of eligible participants who consented to take part; the 
number of participants who completed the trial; the 
number of those who declined to take part and reason for 
doing so; and, the number of people who dropped-out or 
failed to complete the study along with reasons for leav -
ing [55].
Sample size
A formal sample size calculation was not performed as 
the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and 
acceptability of the Playlist for Life intervention for adults 
at the end of life, family members and hospice staff [56]. 
Feasibility studies are not expected to have large sample 
sizes to power statistical null hypothesis testing [57].Data analysis
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, percentages) were 
calculated for PROM scores and demographic data. The 
participant observation and interview data were ana -
lysed using thematic analysis as outlined by Braun and 
Clarke [58]. Thematic analysis can be applied within dif -
ferent theoretical frameworks. In this study the method 
was described as “contextualist” , which covers the ground 
between essentialism and constructionism [58]. Adopt -
ing this approach reports on the experiences, meanings 
and reality of participants in relation to the study inter -
vention. This approach also enables a critical assessment 
of how the shared social context of the Playlist for Life 
intervention exerts influence on meaning. Our aim was 
to develop a rich thematic description across the data 
set to identify significant themes. Based on the analysis, 
decisions to add, change, delete or reword items were 
conducted by two of the authors. We have adhered to the 
consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research 
(COREQ) using their comprehensive 32-item checklist 
to support rigour and transparency in the design and 
conduct of the qualitative research component and the 
subsequent reporting of the qualitative research findings 
[59].
Ethical considerations
NHS ethics (IRAS) ethical approval were sought and 
granted (Ref:19/WS/0077). Clinical governance, research 
management and access approval were granted from the 
hospice Clinical Governance group and Chief Executive.
Participation was voluntary and written informed con -
sent was obtained for all participants before the interven -
tion. Participants had a minimum of 24 hours to read the 
information sheet and decide whether to take part prior 
to consenting. The preservation of confidentiality and 
anonymity of participants were ensured. Demographic 
data, informed consent and data from the documents 
observation and interviews were transcribed and saved 
on an encrypted device and stored in a secure drawer in a 
locked room at the University of Glasgow.
Results
Participant characteristics
A total of n = 18 participants were enrolled (n = 6 
patients, n = 6 family, n = 6 staff), with two participants 
withdrawing from the study, one patient was withdrawn 
on medical advice, one patient withdrew themselves due 
to deteriorating health, one family member participated 
but was not consented so their data were not included. 
Therefore, the study started with 18 participants and 
ended with 15 participants (n = 4 patients, n = 5 fam -
ily, n = 6 staff). Most participants were female (n = 10) 
Page 6 of 14 Johnston et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:32 
with a sample median age of 59 years (range 34–82). All 
patient participants (100%) had a cancer diagnosis as 
their primary illness. The average experience in the hos -
pice service for staff was 6 years (ranging from 6 months 
to 11 years). All family members taking part were identi -
fied by participants as the person who mattered most to 
them. Detailed participant demographic data are shown 
in Table 1.
Participant feedback
Statements from all three participant groups have illus -
trated the desire for Playlist for Life to continue and be 
rolled out to more people. All participants were also sup -
portive of the way we delivered Playlist for Life in this 
trial. Overall, it was thought to be an improvement to 
the existing delivery of Playlist for Life within the hos -
pice. Prior to the structured Playlist for Life interven -
tion being introduced, the work had been undertaken in 
a much more informal and ad hoc basis, reliant on day 
to day availability of appropriate team members and rela -
tives. The use of a more formal template and reflection 
added a level of robustness and reliability to ensure the 
process was completed in a more timely and comprehen -
sive manner.
The inclusion of a family member was met positively 
and has been recognised by staff within the unit as a 
positive and important aspect of the intervention, both 
during the song selection process, but also throughout the playback sessions and as patients become frailer 
towards end of life. This is a clear illustration that our 
methods work and are acceptable to participants, their 
families, and staff and can integrate well with inpatient 
hospice care as it is currently provided.
Many of the family members also reported that tak -
ing part in this project has had benefits for them. Tak -
ing part in the project enhanced their perceived quality 
of life and the chosen songs included a shared memory 
that both the participants and their family member had 
a connection to. In addition, some participants empha -
sised that the benefits were simply the enjoyment of 
listening to music. They also recounted remembering 
happier times and reminiscing about their past as well 
as remembering poignant memories and occasions. 
Music can offer different things to different people, but 
it is important to remember regardless of what music 
evokes for that person that they perceived that it was 
having a positive effect on them and their relationship 
with their family member.
Through the interviews, it was clear that all partici -
pants wanted to see the good and positive in Playlist for 
Life. They wanted it to succeed, wanted it to work for 
participants and families. This demonstrates that Play -
list for Life is a popular intervention, and one people 
are willing to invest their time and effort into. Further -
more, according to all participants the methods used in 
this feasibility study were suitable for implementation

in a future randomised controlled trial and developed 
as a standardised intervention package.
The length of interviews ranged from 5 to 23 min, with 
an average length of 12 min and listening session lengths 
ranged from 10 to 75 min. Common themes generated 
from the interviews were: legacy for future, precious 
memories and living in the moment. The summarised 
themes with example quotes are shown in Appendix 2.
Legacy for future
This theme determined how the participant and fam -
ily member found the experience of setting up their own 
playlist and what this means for them in terms of legacy. 
The staff interviews in particular highlighted and focused 
on Playlist for Life being something that could have a last -
ing effect for both the patient while alive and their family 
when the patient has died. Indeed, particular examples 
raised from staff include the benefit for the family of hav -
ing a Playlist for Life in the final hours of their loved ones 
life. Three sub themes including (i) legacy for people, (ii) 
legacy for others, and (iii) life after hospice/project were 
identified under this theme.
Legacy for people
According to the findings, legacy for people is an essen -
tial facilitator to help individuals for making their life 
enjoyable and dying peacefully. Participants have high -
lighted how using playlist has made their life more joyful 
while approaching end of their life: ‘I feel really chuffed 
that I’ve managed to pick between eight and ten songs 
that are all so different, going over a large part of my life. I 
never thought I’d be able to do that before so it makes me 
really pleased and I’ll enjoy listening to it for as long as I 
can. ’ (Patient participant 5)
The Playlist for life intervention also allowed partici -
pants to share their deepest thoughts and feelings  while 
approaching their end of life journey: ‘I think it’s a way 
of opening up for … especially, for men, because west 
of Scotland men aren’t the best at opening up with their 
feelings and to be able to put it across in a way where it’s 
music that’s bridging that gap … it’s lovely. It’s just lovely, 
and I think it’s a great legacy. ’ (Staff 3). Similarly, another 
participant said: ‘they might not be that, sort of person, 
to, you know, pour all their emotions, but one song could 
tell the family exactly how they’re feeling’ (Staff 2).
Legacy for others
The findings in this study have shown that leaving 
a legacy for others via the Playlist for Life can be an 
important tool to help individuals to cope with their 
bereavement and grief after the death of a loved one. In 
the words of one participant: ‘But they’ve got even closer 
through doing this and I think that’s invaluable, that the relationship they’ve now got and then when the daughter 
does eventually lose her dad, that she will have this and 
the memories they’ve made, it’s been fantastic. ’ (Staff 1)
Another participant said that: ‘I think it’s definitely 
something that’s beneficial for the families for when the 
patient dies and it’s something that they have to remind 
them of that special person’ (Staff 5).
Life after hospice/project
Comments from participants were favourable regarding 
use of the intervention in the future. One participant nar -
rated the following: ‘I hope it goes forward and it helps 
many, many people in the future. ’ (Patient participant 
2 talking about the intervention). Another participant 
highlighted: ‘ … it’s not just a wee thing that happens one 
off, it does continue with them, and they still thank you. 
They’re still listening to it. ’(Staff 3)
The Playlist for Life intervention can also be important 
to enhance participants psychological well-being and 
provide a pre- and post-bereavement support for family 
members. As one participant said: ‘..well, prior to this I 
would go home, and I’d be sitting miserable. But I’m going 
home now, and I would … I’ve had a cheerful afternoon 
and I even spend some time listening to other tunes, which 
I think she would enjoy, later on at night. I’m on the com -
puter … what songs she’s picked, what she … you could 
add to it. So, I believe we’ll be carrying on after this. ’ (Fam -
ily 6)
Precious memories
The Playlist for Life intervention helped participants to 
remember their precious memories in the past. It pro -
vided an opportunity to disclose and reflect on positive 
and negative life experiences, and a history about their 
whole story from the birth to death.
One participant stated: ‘It left me feeling good from 
the point of view that … it was a memory of many things 
that … what it did for me was it began to bring me back 
to some of the nice times in life and the fun times, but 
also that was tinged with sadness because I then began to 
realise that although,` you went through life and you saw 
life as a path and a path of fun and enjoyment that that 
doesn’t really exist without some sadness being in there 
also. ’ (Patient participant 2)
The Playlist for Life intervention helped to remind the 
participants of their life in relation to their family. One 
participant mentioned that the playlist recalled the pre -
cious memories related to family members: ‘Each time I 
listened to it. It just made me think about [brother] more 
and as what we are, brother and sister, and not just, you 
know … back then we were just growing up in that house. 
But we were a family, we were bonded together and that 
Page 8 of 14 Johnston et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:32 
music kind of emphasised that, I think. ’ (Patient partici -
pant 2)
This intervention can also help individuals to cope 
with psychological distress at the end of life by realising 
their positive personal qualities. In the words of another 
participant:
‘Songs that reminded him of parts of his life when he 
was strong and you know, that will maybe help him at 
this stage in his life. ’ (Family 2)
Living in the moment
Another finding of this study was that the Playlist for Life 
intervention enabled participants to deal with daily prob -
lems by helping them to live in the moment. For instance,
‘It makes me feels good, and I enjoy listening to the 
music that I had forgotten … I’ve been looking forward 
to my wee visits and things, because sometimes you feel 
neglected here when the house is empty, but we’ve got a 
project so it keeps your mind going, do you know what I 
mean sort of thing, but the core things are still there, but 
music helps. I’m taking more notice of it now. ’ (Patient c 
1)
It also contributed to the experience of a joyful life and 
making life ‘worth living’ by helping to live in the present 
for people approaching the end of life. As one participant 
said: ‘It just brightens up your life, doesn’t it. Songs you 
listen to it. Makes you happy and want to dance and you 
can’t, but, anyway, I just sit in my wheelchair and dance 
but, aye, it makes you happy, a happy feeling. ’ (Patient 
participant 6) In the words of another participant: ‘It 
makes you sit and spend a wee bit of time together and 
think about different things and enjoy the pleasure of 
music together. ’ (Family 2)
In addition, according to our findings, the Playlist for 
Life intervention can help individuals to cope with the 
challenges of being ill by maintaining normality for peo -
ple at the end of the life. One participant stated: ‘I think, 
it helps to keep everything as normal as possible. ’ (Staff 3)Outcome measure scores
With regard to the outcome measures (Integrated Pal -
liative Care Outcome Scale, Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale, Personalised Music Assessment Tool) 
most patients (n  = 4) completed all measures after the 
intervention. However, two participants (patient par -
ticipant 3 and 4) did not complete measures day 3 and 
7. All baseline questionnaires bar patient participant 4 
were filled out with the researcher present. Patient 4 
filled out the baseline PROMS themselves. Day 3 ques -
tionnaires, bar patient participant 5, were filled out by 
participants themselves or with help from hospice staff  
(patient 6). In addition, day 7 questionnaires were filled 
out by participants themselves or with the researcher 
present. These were filled in more completely as the 
researcher conducted the second listening observation 
session on day 7 and was able to prompt the partici -
pant to fully fill in questionnaires. Data from the par -
ticipants indicated that outcome measures scores did 
not change to a great extent between the baseline score, 
day 3 score and day 7 score. Details around percentage 
changes in scores along the outcome measures is shown 
in Tables 2 , 3, 4, 5, and 6
PROMs were straightforward for staff to under -
stand. One highlighted barrier to completing paper -
work in the inpatient hospice was time. The PROMs 
were completed most effectively when researcher was 
present, sometimes assisting. The Integrated Pallia -
tive Care Outcome Scale was completed the most fully. 
There were 4 out of 14 occasions when the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale was not filled out fully. 
Again, there were four out of 14 occasions when the 
Personalised Music Assessment tool was not filled out 
comprehensively, Participants said the paperwork was 
straightforward, one patient noted it was repetitive. 
No significant changes were noted in medication use 
for participants during the playlist intervention period 
(Table 7 ).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, 
acceptability and practicality of using Playlist for Life for 
adults at the end of life, family members and hospice staff  
in a hospice inpatient unit setting in Scotland. Given that 
many people with life-threatening illnesses will continue 
to have increased needs that could be met through the 
provision of palliative care as their condition progresses, 
it is important that interventions that may facilitate and shape future care are used during a time when input from 
individuals approaching the end of life is possible [1].
The Playlist for Life intervention enabled partici -
pants to leave their loved ones a legacy which could help 
bereaved individuals to cope with their grief after their 
loved ones death. It also enabled people who are nearing 
end of life to feel more generative (the strive to create or 
nurture things that will outlast individuals). According 
to Erikson’s (1963) theory of psychosocial development, Table 3 Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS)–baseline results

leaving a positive legacy before death is an important 
part of the generativity for individuals [60].
Participants indicated that the intervention enabled 
their legacy through a personalised playlist that they can 
share with their loved ones, now and in the future after 
they die. In addition, the Playlist for Life intervention was 
found to be a useful tool to help participants relate their 
lives in relation to their personalities and families, and 
to help them recognise their positive personal qualities. 
In this way, participants were able to look back at their 
life with a sense of satisfaction. In Erikson’s theory it has 
been highlighted that individuals who have ego integrity 
are able to face the end of their life with no regrets and 
can accept the death as an integral and natural part of 
life [60]. This intervention can also facilitate individuals’ search for meaning, especially while facing a life-threat -
ening disease. Facilitating and supporting patients in 
pursuit of meaning at the end of life is also important 
to improve psychological well-being in people with life-
threatening disease [61].
The findings of our feasibility study also demonstrated 
that the Playlist for life intervention could be likened 
to creating a person-centred ‘time capsule’ for partic -
ipants—a journey to their past and present and even 
looking into the future after they have died. This con -
curs with previous evidence that highlighted that music 
worked like “acoustic reminders of childhood memories” 
and encouraged individuals to open up, to travel back 
and forth between the past, the present and the future 
[62]. This travel also enabled them to share their deep -
est thoughts and feelings  and complete unfinished busi -
ness, thus providing critical information about their 
plans for the future, while approaching their end of life 
journey [63]. Staff found that participants really wel -
comed the opportunity to ‘speak to their family’ in terms 
of the playlist. Also, in the study families were ‘gifted’ a 
booklet with the songs chosen and why these were cho -
sen. This allowed people to tell their families some things, 
including loving and personal memories, they were not 
able to verbalise. In addition, previous evidence from a 
randomised, controlled trial demonstrated that music 
intervention fostered feelings of resilience and increased 
expression of emotions [64].
Our study results demonstrated that the intervention 
was enjoyable, brought mixed emotions both happy and 
sad, and that it enabled participants to be closer to their 
family members by sharing old and creating new memo -
ries. Participants indicated that the intervention helped 
them to live in the moment and they felt relaxed while 
enjoying the pleasure of music, reducing symptoms like 
anxiety and distress. Music affects the release of neuro -
transmitters which are responsible for the induction of 
feelings of happiness and for the reward system in the Table 6 Personalised Music Assessment Tool results

brain [65]. Hence, all of these feelings of participants may 
be explained by the release of the neurotransmitters such 
as dopamine and serotonin, which play an important role 
in reducing stress [40]. In addition, previous clinical stud -
ies have demonstrated the psychological effects of music 
on people who have a life-threatening illness, with sig -
nificant results in reducing anxiety, stress, depression, 
thus improving quality of life, mood and psychological 
well-being [32–39]. A study by Garabedian and Kelly 
(2020) reported that music intervention was successful 
at transporting listeners away from their present reality 
into an absorbing, fulfilling, and enjoyable ‘haven’ [34]. 
This evidence demonstrates that music has an important 
role in creating a joyful environment in individuals lives. 
According to the literature creating a joyful environment 
can facilitate living in the moment (i.e. listening to music, 
gardening, building a shed, reading a newspaper). Living 
in the moment for people nearing end of life is important 
to help them cope with the uncertainty of life by provid -
ing dignified person-centred care [66]. Focusing on sim -
ple pleasure and not worrying about the future enables 
people to carry out their daily routines, and helps them 
set realistic goals [66–68]. Even though most participants 
experienced greater well-being while listening to music, 
given their emotional vulnerability, the surfacing of sad 
memories can still occur and may be distressing. There -
fore, it is important to not leave a person to listen to their 
music alone and to provide a safe environment [18].
This study sought to assess the feasibility of an inter -
vention to improve future care for people at the end of 
life, as well as their willingness to engage in such a study. 
The study has yielded good indicators for this group of 
participants as well as a desire to take part. It showed 
that the Playlist for Life intervention was well received by 
people with life-threatening illness, their family members 
and hospice staff. All participants felt that Playlist for 
Life could help people at the end of life and their fam -
ily. In addition, feedback was favourable regarding use of 
the intervention in the future. The method and outcome 
measures proposed were appropriate and acceptable for 
participants, did not pose any significant difficulties and 
also provided results that could provide useful informa -
tion if used in a future larger-scale randomised controlled 
trial.
In this feasibility study, the intervention approach was 
based on the selection of a playlist by people at the end of 
life and their family member together. This approach pro -
vided closer relationships among participants and their 
families, while engaging in discussion and exploration to 
discover the autobiographical memories and emotional 
connections the patient had for the selected songs or 
pieces of music. This process also helped them to create 
their life history through a unique personal music playlist as a special legacy. According to literature, the act itself of 
choosing music together allows a deep connection to be 
quickly established [69]. The act of the patient and fam -
ily member choosing music makes use of the potential of 
the individual, focusing on ‘noticing, acknowledging and 
making use of the individual’s resources via the foster -
ing of a collaborative relationship’ Indeed, this approach 
including the collaborative therapeutic relationship is 
a core component to delivering person-centred care for 
people at the end of life [69].
Feasibility evaluation is an essential part of developing 
complex interventions, preventing problems that could 
undermine the conduct or acceptability of future evalu -
ation and informing the parameters of the future evalu -
ation design [70]. The findings of this feasibility study 
highlight the possibility of implementing the Playlist for 
Life intervention for adults at the end of life, and their 
family members and prove high compliance with the 
intervention protocol and evaluation.
Limitations and strengths
This study has several strengths: first, the mixed-method 
design using a multiple baseline design and qualitative 
study. Second, the protocol was refined through stake -
holder consultation. Third, discussions with academ -
ics and clinical experts helped to prevent the systematic 
bias from a single researcher. In addition, the qualitative 
interviews provided additional insights into other aspects 
not easily assessed by quantitative outcome measures.
We acknowledge the limitations of this study. The limi -
tations of our feasibility study are that it is limited by the 
small sample from one hospice setting and only included 
participants who have cancer. Participants might have 
wanted to see the good and positive features of the inter -
vention as they were volunteers and were recruited by 
hospice staff initially. The study did not have the aim of 
generating an assessment of effectiveness, although use -
ful indicators have been yielded about the suitability 
of outcome measures for a future study. Beyond a pilot 
study, a large-scale randomised controlled trial would 
seek to confirm generalisability of results.
Conclusion
This study has shown that Playlist for Life is feasible and 
acceptable as a person-centred intervention for adults 
at the end of life, family members and hospice staff in 
a hospice inpatient setting in Scotland. The feasibil -
ity findings show that it is worth proceeding to a larger 
scale study that will provide more detailed analysis of 
findings and widen the use of the outcome measures to 
provide greater pre- and post-intervention evaluation. 
The study has produced some evidence that may inform 
and enhance the care of people who have a life threating

disease to address the needs of patients and their fami -
lies and deliver a quality person-centred palliative care 
in hospice settings. Furthermore, Playlist for Life is cur -
rently being used in the intervention study site with staff  
members working with the intervention reporting posi -
tive experiences about its utility and benefits for people 
and their families.

Appendix 2 Overarching themes for ’Playlist for Life’
Overarching themes Details Sample quotes
Legacy for Future This theme deter -
mined how patients 
and family members 
found the experience 
of setting up their 
own playlist and what 
this means for them 
in terms of legacy.‘so he’s now died peace -
fully knowing that in a 
way that he’s left an apol-
ogy for her and she’s got 
that. So she’s got peace 
and comfort afterwards. ’ 
(Staff 1)
‘I think it’s definitely 
something that’s benefi-
cial for the families for 
when the patient passes 
away and it’s something 
that they have to remind 
them of that special 
person’ (Staff 5)Overarching themes Details Sample quotes
Precious memories The Playlist for Life 
intervention helped 
participants to remind 
their precious memo -
ries in the past. It pro -
vided an opportunity 
to disclose and reflect 
on positive and nega-
tive life experiences, 
and a history about 
their whole story from 
the birth to death. 
This intervention also 
facilitated help indi-
viduals to cope with 
psychological distress 
at the end of life by 
realising their positive 
personal qualities.‘It left me feeling good 
from the point of view 
that there were many 
… it was a memory of 
many things that … 
what it did for me was it 
began to bring me back 
to some of the ice times

but also that was tinged 
with sadness because 
I then began to realise 
that although you went 
through life and you 
saw life as a path and a 
path of fun and enjoy-
ment that that doesn’t 
really exist without 
some sadness being in 
there also.’ (Patient 2)
‘Songs that reminded 
him of parts of his life 
when he was strong 
and you know, that 
will maybe help him 
at this stage in his life.’ 
(Family 2)
Living in the 
momentThe Playlist for 
Life intervention 
contributed to the 
experience of a joy-
ful life and making 
life ’worth living’ by 
helping to live in the 
present for people 
approaching the end 
of life. It also provided 
to deal with daily 
problems by helping 
them to live in the 
moment and main-
tain normality.‘It just brightens up your 
life, doesn’t it. Songs 
you listen to it. Makes 
you happy and want to 
dance and you can’t, but, 
anyway , I just sit in my 
wheelchair and dance 
but , aye, it makes you 
happy, a happy feeling. ’

‘I think, it help to keep 
everything as normal as 
possible. ’ (Staff 3)
