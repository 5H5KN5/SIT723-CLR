Abstract 
Background: The Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) was developed in 2008 as a 
contextually expanded version of the broadly used Reach, Adoption, Effectiveness, Implementation, and Maintenance 
(RE-AIM) framework. PRISM provides researchers a pragmatic and intuitive model to improve translation of research 
interventions into clinical and community practice. Since 2008, the use of PRISM increased across diverse topics, 
populations, and settings. This citation analysis and scoping systematic review aimed to assess the use of the PRISM 
framework and to make recommendations for future research.
Methods: A literature search was conducted using three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus) for the period 
of 2008 and September 2020. After exclusion, reverse citation searches and invitations to experts in the field were 
used to identify and obtain recommendations for additional articles not identified in the original search. Studies that 
integrated PRISM into their study design were selected for full abstraction. Unique research studies were abstracted 
for information on study characteristics (e.g., setting/population, design), PRISM contextual domains, and RE-AIM 
outcomes.
Results: A total of 180 articles were identified to include PRISM to some degree. Thirty-two articles representing 23 
unique studies integrated PRISM within their study design. Study characteristics varied widely and included studies 
conducted in diverse contexts, but predominately in high-income countries and in clinical out-patient settings. With 
regards to use, 19 used PRISM for evaluation, 10 for planning/development, 10 for implementation, four for sustain-
ment, and one for dissemination. There was substantial variation across studies in how and to what degree PRISM 
contextual domains and RE-AIM outcomes were operationalized and connected. Only two studies directly connected 
individual PRISM context domains with RE-AIM outcomes, and another four included RE-AIM outcomes without direct 
connection to PRISM domains.
Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of the use of PRISM in various contexts. While there were low levels of 
‘integrated’ use of PRISM and few reports on linkage to RE-AIM outcomes, most studies included important con-
text domains of implementation and sustainability infrastructure and external environment. Recommendations are

Contributions to the literature
• We provide an overview of the use of PRISM for plan -
ning, implementation, or evaluation. Key characteris -
tics for PRISM use include study location, considera -
tion of health equity, target population, setting, health 
topics, study designs, methods, level of analysis, and 
operationalization of PRISM context domains and RE-
AIM outcomes.
• We illustrate how PRISM has been used in across a 
wide range of applications and which PRISM domains 
have been reported most and least often.
• Recommendations are provided for researchers and 
practitioners for the more consistent and comprehen -
sive use of and reporting on PRISM to inform the con -
sideration of contextual factors in implementation.
Introduction
The field of implementation science has made significant 
advancements towards understanding how evidence-
based practices, programs, and policies are adopted and 
implemented in different clinical and community set -
tings [1, 2]. While there is a wide range of evidence-based 
interventions, it is still the case that less is known about 
successfully implementing and sustaining these programs 
in a range of settings [3, 4]. Implementation science has 
emphasized the development and use of theories, mod -
els, and frameworks (TMF) to guide and understand 
translation of research into practice [5, 6] and has prior -
itized understanding how health care and public health 
programs interact with context and both implementers 
and beneficiaries to influence adoption, engagement, 
equity [7], implementation, reach, effectiveness, and sus -
tainment [8–11].
There is increasing interest [12, 13] but still limited 
understanding of which contextual factors [3, 14–17] 
have an impact on the initial uptake; equitable implemen -
tation, reach, effectiveness; and sustained use of complex 
health interventions [18] in a variety of clinical and com -
munity settings, which inhibits the translation of research 
into practice [10]. More specifically, there is a need to 
document and understand the impact of the dynamic 
context in which interventions are integrated [19–23]. 
The Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability 
Model (PRISM) was developed to fill this need using key concepts from research on and models of chronic care, 
the diffusion of innovations, quality improvement, and 
measures of population-based effectiveness for translat -
ing research into practice [3, 4].
PRISM was developed as a contextually expanded ver -
sion of the broadly used Reach, Adoption, Effectiveness, 
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, 
and as a pragmatic and intuitive model to improve trans -
lation of research-tested interventions into clinical and 
community practice and ultimately population health 
impact [24]. PRISM can be considered a determinant 
and evaluation framework in the classification suggested 
by Nilsen [25] and, as illustrated in Fig.  1, considers how 
perspectives of the program, policy, or intervention 
design; the external environment; the implementation 
and sustainability infrastructure; and the characteristics 
of multiple levels of “recipients” (e.g., implementers, ben -
eficiaries) influence program adoption, implementation, 
and maintenance. Within the program or intervention 
design domain and the recipient domain, PRISM incor -
porates the perspectives of both the patients (recipients 
or participants) and the organizational members at dif -
ferent levels of influence (e.g., top leadership, mid-level 
managers, and frontline staff) to help understand what 
factors within and external to the organization need to be 
considered and addressed for successful implementation 
and sustainability of complex interventions [26]. A rela -
tively unique aspect of PRISM, compared to most other 
models addressing context, is explicit inclusion of the 
domain of the “implementation and sustainability infra -
structure” (e.g., clear roles and responsibilities related to 
this program; timely data reporting capabilities, strong 
communication channels). Inclusion of this domain was 
based on experience in healthcare settings in which those 
settings that were able to implement and sustain pro -
grams most consistently had the type of infrastructure 
and support resources noted in this domain. The out -
come measures hypothesized to be influenced by PRISM 
contextual factors include RE-AIM outcomes of reach, 
effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and individual- 
and organizational-level maintenance (www. re- aim. org) 
[4, 27].
Since 2008, PRISM has been used across diverse topics, 
populations, and settings. The purpose of this citation 
analysis and scoping systematic review was to explore 
and describe how PRISM has been used, how it has been 
operationalized, for what populations and settings, and provided for more consistent and comprehensive use of and reporting on PRISM to inform both research and practice 
on contextual factors in implementation.

with what outcomes. Specifically, the review aimed to (1) 
summarize use of PRISM to date; (2) identify and address 
conceptual and methodological issues to potentially 
improve research in this area; and (3) provide recommen -
dations for research teams and practitioners about using 
PRISM to improve translation of evidence-based inter -
ventions in a variety of clinical and community settings.
Methods
We conducted a systematic scoping literature review to 
determine how PRISM has been used. A literature search 
was conducted using three databases PubMed, Web of 
Science, and Scopus. The search algorithm included 
((“Practical” AND “Robust” AND “Implementation” 
AND “Sustainability” AND “Model”) OR (“Practical, 
Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model”)) OR 
(“Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability 
Model”).
The date range was from 2008 (publication date of the 
original PRISM manuscript) through September 2020. 
Further, following the approach described by Bergstörm 
et al. [28], we conducted a reverse citation search of the 
original PRISM article (i.e., index article) in PubMed 
reviewing all papers that cited this index paper to iden -
tify studies that used PRISM [4]. Only peer-reviewed articles were included in this review. First, duplicates 
were removed from the results. Full-text articles were 
obtained for all articles identified in the searches and 
were independently reviewed by two researchers (BR, JC) 
to determine eligibility. Articles were excluded if they did 
not cite or specify PRISM or were not yet published in 
a peer-reviewed journal. We adapted and refined catego -
ries previously developed by Field et  al. [29] to classify 
the extent PRISM was used in the articles (i.e., referenced 
the model, framing a field or in a review, informed by the 
model, directed by the model, or integrated the model 
into the study design) (Table  1). Classification of arti -
cles per the Field et  al categories [29] was done by two 
members of the team (BR, JC). Discrepancies in classifi -
cation were resolved through consensus discussion and 
the involvement of the other members of the abstrac -
tion team (CG, BG). Because one purpose of this review 
was to explore the degree to which PRISM propositions 
were supported (i.e., relationships between PRISM con -
textual factors and RE-AIM outcomes), only studies 
that met the criteria for ‘integrated use, ’ which required 
explicit linking of study activities to PRISM domains and/
or subdomains, of the PRISM framework were included 
[29]. Following the database searches and initial eligibil -
ity screening, the list of included articles was circulated Fig. 1 The Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model
Page 4 of 26 Rabin et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:62 
to an expert panel of implementation science research -
ers via a national listserv to obtain recommendations 
for additional articles that described an integrated use of 
PRISM not identified in the original search.
All articles that were categorized as integrating PRISM 
into their study design (i.e., integrated use [29]) were 
selected for full abstraction. Articles that described the 
same study were bundled as primary and companion 
papers and were abstracted together. Data abstraction 
was conducted by four researchers (BR, BG, CG, and JC). 
Data abstraction forms were developed based on prior 
work of the co-authors in reviewing the use of the RE-
AIM framework [30, 31]. We expanded these abstrac -
tions forms to include PRISM contextual domains of 
characteristics of the intervention, characteristics of 
the recipients (including the multi-level organizational 
setting), implementation and sustainability infrastruc -
ture, and external environment. The abstraction form 
was then iteratively refined as the team tested it on the 
abstraction of four studies and then programmed into a 
REDCap database [ 32, 33]. The rest of the eligible articles 
were assigned to pairs of researchers to independently 
abstract. The pairs of coders met to review their abstrac -
tions, resolve discrepancies, and reach consensus. Con -
sensus, rotation of abstraction teams, and iterative group 
discussions were used to ensure the accuracy and con -
sistency of data abstraction.
The database was used to capture information from 
three key domains: study characteristics (setting, design, 
population, etc.), PRISM contextual domains, and RE-
AIM outcomes [32, 33]. Articles were categorized as 
addressing planning/development, dissemination, imple -
mentation, evaluation, and/or sustainment. To describe 
the degree (i.e., quality and extent) of operationalization 
of PRISM domains, we used a scale of 0-5 in which 0 
indicated poor operationalization and 5 indicated excel -
lent operationalization. Ratings were separately made 
for each type of use of PRISM (i.e., planning/develop -
ment, dissemination, implementation, evaluation, and/or sustainment). Two abstractors per article/study rated 
the degree of operationalization and used a consen -
sus approach to decide on the final rating. They also 
documented the rational for their rating in a qualitative 
manner. If articles included lessons learned about opera -
tionalizing PRISM, this information was also systemati -
cally abstracted (see Additional file  1). Key themes from 
lessons learned were synthesized based on the review of 
this data by the lead author.
Results
Included studies
Of the 237 unique articles identified, 57 were excluded 
for not meeting the initial inclusion criteria (Fig.  2 and 
Table  1). A total of 180 articles were identified as using 
PRISM to some degree (i.e., referenced the model, fram -
ing a field or in a review, informed by the model, directed 
by the model, or integrated the model into the study 
design). As shown in Fig.  3, the number of publications 
increased over time as we moved from 2008 (n=3) to 
2019 (n=31). Overall increases in the proportion of 
directed and integrated articles were also observed (see 
Table 1 for definitions).
Of the 180 initially identified articles, 29 (16.1%) 
included PRISM as a potential means for understand -
ing the current state of research or advancing research 
in a specific field (i.e., framing), and 14 articles (7.8%) 
included PRISM in a review of frameworks (i.e., reviews). 
Eleven articles (6.1%) mentioned that PRISM informed 
their study without specifying how the model was used 
(i.e., informed), and another 23 articles (12.8%) provided 
more details as to how PRISM was used in developing 
their study but lacked specific details about how the 
domains were operationalized (i.e., directed). Seventy-
two articles (40.0%) referenced PRISM in either the 
introduction or discussion as an alternative model that 
was not used in their study methods (i.e., referenced). 
Finally, 31 articles (17.2%), representing 23 unique stud -
ies, were determined to integrate PRISM into their study Table 1 Categories and definitions for the use of the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) in published 
peer-reviewed literature, adapted from Field et al. (2014) [29]
Framing Field/Area The PRISM framework is used to understand the current state of the field and guide directions for future research and practice.
Review The PRISM framework has been described in a review of frameworks as one of the frameworks.
Referenced The PRISM framework is cited (often not named) to establish a broader context for the Implementation Science field with no 
further explanation of direct relevance to this study.
Informed The PRISM framework cited and named often in the introduction or discussion as it relates to this study or future related studies 
but no explanation of direct use.
Directed The PRISM framework had influenced project planning or design but no specifics or examples are given.
Integrated The PRISM framework was integral to the planning, design, delivery, evaluation, interpretation, and/or dissemination and scale-
up and scale-out of the study/project.
Exclude The PRISM framework was not cited in the paper.

design and were abstracted (Fig.  2) [29]. One additional 
article was added to the final abstraction as it was iden -
tified as a later published result for an initially included 
protocol article (the total number of publications in 
the integrated category was n =32). For the full list of 
included papers, their categorization by use, and search 
source, see Additional file 2 .
Study characteristics
Of the 23 abstracted studies, 17 were conducted in the 
USA, and only three were conducted in low-middle 
income countries. Thirteen studies addressed primary 
or secondary prevention as the main topic area followed 
by seven studies related to mental health, four on veter -
ans’ health, three on cancer, two on infectious disease, 
two on reproductive health (including OBGYN), one on clinical guidelines, and eight were coded as other top -
ics. Eighteen of the studies addressed health equity, as 
defined as “reducing and ultimately eliminating dispari -
ties in health and its determinants that adversely affect 
excluded or marginalized groups” [34] (Table  2). Most 
frequent operationalization of addressing health equity 
was through the focus of the study on underserved 
populations.
The target populations for the studies were mainly 
focused on the providers or delivery agents (n = 20), 
but most also included the setting level (n =16) and 
patient or community (n =15 for both groups). One 
study targeted payors and another targeted policy 
makers (Table  3). Most studies that integrated PRISM 
were conducted in the clinical out-patient setting 
(n=13) with a minority of studies being conducted in 
Fig. 2 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram of systematic review of articles using Practical, 
Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM)

community settings (n =4). Additional settings identi -
fied were clinical in-patient (n =3), schools (n =2), or 
as part of a national health initiative (n =2). Two stud -
ies were conducted in other settings (i.e., a care tran -
sition context and a regional evaluation). The study 
design varied greatly across studies with seven being 
stand-alone protocol papers, five being randomized 
controlled trials, four quasi-experimental pre/post 
designs, three case studies, one cohort study, and one 
narrative piece (Table  3). Of note, nine were classified 
as having a design different from above such as quali -
tative implementation study, cross-sectional study, and 
adaptation study. The type of study varied from nine 
that were specifically implementation focused; six that 
were type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation; three 
efficacy studies; and two were effectiveness studies. 
Five studies were classified as pilot studies and five did 
not fit into any of the study type categories. The most 
frequently used methods used were qualitative (n =8), 
mixed methods (n =7) and multi-method (n =6). Only 
two studies reported strictly quantitative methods. In 
terms of socioecologic level, 14 studies used setting, 
four individual, three delivery agent, and two had mul -
tiple levels at which randomization and/or data collec -
tion happened.PRISM use
PRISM was used primarily for study evaluation (n=19), 
but also for planning and development (n=10), and 
implementation (n=10). Obviously, many addressed 
multiple implementation stages. Four studies addressed 
sustainment, and only one study addressed dissemina -
tion (Additional file  3). The research team identified two 
studies, Ayele, R. A., et  al. [36] and Leonard et  al. [48], 
that used PRISM for planning and development, imple -
mentation, and evaluation. Woodbridge, M. W., et  al. 
[61] was found to be an exemplar in evaluation and sus -
tainment. There were no exemplar studies identified for 
dissemination.
Table  3 provides further details on the extent to which 
studies included the various context domains of PRISM 
and Table  4 shows what sub-domains were addressed. 
Twenty-two studies included perspectives on the Pro -
gram/Intervention from the organizational lens, with 
nearly three-quarters addressing barriers for frontline 
staff. There were 15 studies including Program/Inter -
vention from the patient perspective focusing on patient 
barriers, being patient-centered, and addressing service 
and access. Recipient characteristics at the organiza -
tional level (n=18) focused on management support and 
communication as well as shared goals and cooperation. 
Recipient patient characteristics reported (n=16) were

participants consistently discussed that 
transitions were delayed when they 
were not able to (1) identify patients as 
veterans and notify VA primary care of 
discharge, (2) transfer non-VA hospital 
medical records to VA primary care, (3) 
obtain follow-up care appointments 
with VA primary care, and (4) write VA 
formulary medications for veterans 
that they could fill at VA pharmacies. 
Each theme was attributed in part to 
external environment and implemen-
tation and sustainability infrastructure 
contextual factors. The initial theme 
also was attributed in part to recipient 
(patient-level) characteristics. Partici-
pants also discussed factors involved in 
smooth transition and recommenda-
tions to improve care coordination 
suggesting positive implementation 
and sustainability infrastructure con-
text factors also existed.

(N)Three educational strategies/ inter -

Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) 
symptom recognition and manage -
mentN/R N/R The survey indicated that all 3 inter -
ventions minimally disrupted workflow 
and all were recognized as useful. To 
ensure sustainable implementation, 
the characteristics of the unit should 
be considered when selecting an 
educational program. When parents/
caregivers of pediatric ICU patients are 
given targeted education about PICS, 
their knowledge of the syndrome, its 
signs and symptoms, how to contact 
a social worker, self-management 
techniques, and available resources 
increases. In general, education about 
PICS itself, and how a family might 
receive assistance during their child’s 
ICU stay, is well supported by PICU 
nurses and perceived to be both 
important and not significantly disrup -
tive to daily workflow. Overall, the costs 
of such a program are relatively low. 
Therefore, it is feasible for significant 
PICS-related education and family sup -
port to be provided in almost any PICU 
setting in a locally sustainable fashion.

study as a framework for interven-
tion adaptation into a new setting 
such that the resulting modified 
4R2S intervention is maximized for 
subsequent implementation success. 
Use of an implementation framework 
may be increasingly necessary to 
guide basic intervention develop -
ment to increase the likelihood that 
newly developed interventions are 
integrated into everyday practice.Advisory board members reported dif-
ficulties engaging families, heavy work -
loads, and conflicting implementation 
initiatives. While 4R2S was perceived as 
generally aligned with their organiza-
tion’s mission, modifications to the 
intervention and to agency procedures 
were recommended to promote 
implementation success. Suggested 
modifications to the existing 4R2S 
training and supervision are discussed. 
Findings underscore the importance of 
understanding the experiences of CW 
service providers, which can inform 
future efforts to implement child men-
tal health EBIs in CW services. (Gopalan, 
G., et al. [43]).
Recommendations included adjusting 
curriculum to better fit the culture 
of recipients and conveying the 
importance of openness and respect 
to providers (Hooley, C., et al. [44]).

as a guide in the development phase 
of evidence-informed practices to 
pre-empt many of common agency, 
provider, and consumer level chal-
lenges of implementation. PRISM and 
a collaborative approach guided the 
revision of the 4Rs 2 Ss program to 
increase agency-level uptake of the 
program.Facilitators and directors reported an 
overall positive experience in imple -
menting the 4 Rs Program. Given that 
every clinic functions somewhat differ -
ently, flexibility in the implementation 
of the 4 Rs Program is vital. To advance 
the first statewide implementation of 
the 4 Rs Program, CTAC staff utilized 
PRISM to guide model modifications 
serving to enhance agency-level 
uptake. A collaborative approach 
guided model revisions such that the 
resulting program manual was co-
created by family members, providers, 
and research staff to promote the 
existing evidence base in “user friendly” 
language. While the main components 
of the model based on the evidence-
base remain the same, the revised 
version is streamlined to cut down 
on complexity, reduce the number of 
materials, better fit into current clinic 
structures, and is supported through a 
learning collaborative process.

Centers. To increase screening rates, 
Mi-MAMO was started in August 2017. 
Between January and December 2018, 
the number of women who received 
a screening mammogram increased 
to 567. Twenty-four percent (n = 185) 
completed diagnostic services, and 10 
women received positive breast cancer 
diagnoses (mean age, 49.7 years); all 
successfully navigated to treatment. 
Deploying an integrated framework 
for patient navigation programs can 
increase breast cancer screening 
utilization and awareness among 
under-resourced populations at higher 
risk for breast cancer.

Outreach
Health-System Quality ImprovementSuccess was due in large part to the 
activation of three different domains 
within the PRISM framework: 
changing the delivery system design 
through centralizing screening 
efforts (implementation infrastruc-
ture); switching to a more accurate 
and feasible fecal test (external envi-
ronment); and providing educational 
and electronic support (recipients 
of intervention). The combination of 
these actions resulted in a successful 
and sustained improvement in CRC 
screening rates.Addressing barriers at multiple levels of 
a health system by changing the deliv-
ery system design to add a centralized 
outreach program, switching to a 
more accurate and easier to use fecal 
test, and providing educational and 
electronic support saw CRC screening 
rates improve 10% during program 
implementation and they continue 
to rise.

representing involved clinical and

stakeholders supported the concept 
of universal screening, they identified 
several internal organizational) and 
external (environment) factors that 
promote or hinder implementation. 
Facilitating factors included perceived 
benefits of screening for patients and 
organization, collaboration between 
departments, and availability of organi-
zational resources. Barriers were also 
identified, including: lack of awareness 
of guidelines, lack of guideline clarity, 
staffing and program “ownership” 
concerns, and cost uncertainties. 
Analysis also revealed nine important 
infrastructure-type considerations for 
successful implementation. Require -

collaboration and communication, 
patient and provider/ staff education, 
and significant infrastructure and 
resource support related to laboratory

(N)Screening and brief intervention 
(SBI) consists of a short conversa-
tion focused on identifying problem 
drinking, motivating and facilitating 
reduction in drinking or abstinence 
to reduce the risk of harm.N/R
(N/R)N/R In several health boards, where 
reported maternal alcohol use was 
lower than expected, implementation 
leaders sought to optimize enquires 
about women’s alcohol use to facilitate 
honest disclosure. Strategies focused 
on having positive conversations, 
exploring pre-pregnancy drinking 
habits, and building a trusting relation-
ship between pregnant women and 
midwives. Women’s responses were 
encouraging and disclosure rates 
appeared improved, though with 
some unexpected variation over time. 
Adapting the intervention to the local 
context was also considered impor -
tant. This is the first study to explore 
implementation leaders’ experiences of 
antenatal SBI delivery and identify pos-
sible changes in disclosure rates arising 
from the approach taken. Systems-
informed evaluations of interventions 
in this setting that include consid-
eration of unintended consequences 
are vital. A flexible, conversational 
approach to discussing alcohol with 
pregnant women was considered 
superior to formal tools for identifying 
who might benefit from interventions.

(Y- Underserved)4Rs and 2Ss, a clinical intervention 
for groups of families with children 
(aged 7-11 years old) who meet the 
diagnostic criteria for oppositional 
defiant disorder or conduct disorder.Learning Collaborative (LC)
TrainingThe PRISM model was a useful frame -
work to organize the data from the 
LC, which highlighted the aspects 
of program, external environment, 
implementation, sustainability infra-
structure, and recipients that either 
promoted or hindered adoption of 
the 4Rs program beyond the initial 
period of active support afforded by 
the LC environment.Clinics that were more proactive 
evidenced staff with advanced organi-
zational skills were able to take advan-
tage of the trainings and supports 
offered by the LC and fared better in 
their ability to adopt the intervention. 
The ability to adapt the intervention 
to the specific constraints of the clinics 
was a strong influence on continued 
use following the end of the LC. The 
dedicated service provided by the staff 
of the learning collaborative appeared 
to positively impact the rollout of the 
4Rs Program. Problem-solving was a 
key component of the LC process. This 
translated to practical questions being 
answered in the sessions about what 
could be reasonably amended while 
maintaining fidelity. While success var -
ied across clinics, there were a number 
of characteristics that were identified 
that are linked to successful adoption. 
These included factors related to their 
use of the program, their response to 
external environmental pressures, their 
mobilization of implementation and 
sustainability infrastructure, and recipi-
ent characteristics.

because of its adaptability and flex -

identified were positive influences on 
sites’ implementation, including readi-
ness to change (for example, to reduce 
high readmission rates), the presence 
of coordination across depart -

also negatively influence and hinder 
program implementation.

(Y- Underserved)First Step to Success is an early 
intervention program designed to 
help children in primary grades who 
are at risk for developing aggressive 
or antisocial behavior patterns.N/R N/R A higher dosage of intervention days 
delivered successfully in the classroom 
was associated with higher academic 
engagement. Higher dosage of Home 
Base sessions was associated with 
higher academic engaged time. First 
Step was associated with improve -
ments in students’ pro-social skills 
and reductions in problem behaviors. 
Teachers’ higher implementation 
fidelity was associated with greater 
student gains, and teachers’ delivery of 
higher dosage of First Step was associ-
ated with students’ greater academic 
engagement. From the qualitative 
data the participants did not think the 
intervention was overly complex or 
burdensome to implement. Educators 
advocated for a supportive infrastruc-
ture including high-quality, easily 
accessible training and regular techni-
cal assistance in the classroom. Partici-
pants recommended that teachers and 
students have access to the consistent 
support of a mentor or coach, who can 
encourage engagement in the EBP , 
problem solve about daily behavioral 
issues in the classroom, and provide 
immediate feedback about participant 
successes and challenges.

successful and sustained imple -

implementation strategies that 
operate at the clinic, provider, and 
patient levels.Providers found the aTS appropriate with 
high potential for scale-up but not with-
out difficulties in startup, patient selec-
tion and recruitment, and clinic workflow 
integration. Patients largely found the 
aTS easy to use and helpful; however, low 
perceived need for self-management 
support contributed to high declination. 
The aTS is a promising intervention for 
improving patient self-management; 
however, augmented approaches to 
implementation may be needed to 
support clinician buy-in and patient 
engagement. Despite positive percep -
tions of the aTS, patient enrollment 
was challenging; however, augmented 
facilitation resulted in the greater 
sustained engagement of patients once 
they enrolled. Among patients who used 
the aTS (texters) there was an indication 
of improved illness perception, health 
engagement, and patient activation.

or utilized some item of HE. Distance 
to PHC sectors was associated with 
the knowledge of HE, gender and 
health insurance were associated with 
utilization of HE. Age, marital status, 
occupation region, and self-reported 
health were associated with satisfaction 
regarding HE. Barriers to HE delivery 
included defects in HE design, weak 
capacity in PHC sectors to provide HE, 
residents’ poor cooperation, lack of multi-
sector cooperation, poor equipment 
and weak health system. Southwest 
China delivered HE in all PHC sectors. 
However, our study underlined many 
barriers to equalization of HE. To address 
those barriers and achieve HE quality 
improvement, comprehensive measures 
to improve capacity of PHC sectors, 
enhance multi-sector cooperation and 
strengthen health information systems 
are all urgent needs [63].
More than 85% of aged individuals 
had knowledge and utilization of HMA, 
and over 94% of these respondents 
were satisfied with HMA. Challenges 
in HMA delivery included weakness 
(unmet items and lack of appropriate 
assessment indicators) in HMA design, 
low capacity of PHC sectors and com-
petency of LHWs to deliver HMA, poor 
health literacy of aged individuals, 
insufficient funds, and a lack of multi-
sector cooperation. Though significant 
achievements in HMA were observed, 
this study highlighted the challenges 
in further quality improvement of 
HMA delivery program in Southwest 
China. The “older-person-centered 
and integrated care” model provided a 
good theory to improve the quality of 
HMA by reinforcing the needs-based 
HMA design, building a comprehen-
sive assessment strategy, improving 
the capacity of PHC sectors and the 
LHWs’ competency, and strengthening 
multi-sector cooperation [64].

primarily related to demographics. Most studies (n=21) 
included Implementation and Sustainability Infrastruc -
ture and performance data was the most frequent sub-
domain reported within this factor. Studies addressing 
the external environment domain (n=19) were primarily 
focused on community resources.
In terms of the operationalization of the PRISM con -
text domains, most domains were operationalized using 
qualitative methods followed by quantitative, mixed 
methods, and muti-methods approaches and only one 
study used a narrative approach. The specific distribution 
of the methods for each domain is provided in Table  4. 
Specific techniques used for data collection about each 
domain were not as consistently reported but a general 
review of themes identified interviews, focus groups, and 
surveys as the most common approaches of data collec -
tion with a few studies reporting the use of more innova -
tive approaches such as brainwriting or process mapping) 
(data not shown). When rating the degree of operation -
alization of the PRISM domains across the various stages 
of use of PRISM (i.e., planning/development, dissemina -
tion, implementation, evaluation, and sustainment) we 
found that average ratings were similar across the stages 
and ranged from 2.3 to 3.1 on the scale of 0 to 5 where 
0 was poor and 5 excellent. Operationalization of the 
PRISM domains for supporting sustainment was rated 
on average the lowest and implementation the highest. 
Lower ratings were due to a lack of specificity on how the 
PRISM domains were operationalized for the given stage.
Only eight included studies provided specific lessons 
learned about the contribution of PRISM to planning, 
implementation, and/or evaluation (Table  2). The fol -
lowing key themes were identified when reviewing the 
lessons learned: (1) PRISM was useful in supporting 
pre-implementation planning and adaptation of inter -
ventions to multilevel contexts [42, 45, 48]; (2) PRISM 
was feasible and useful in supporting the implementa -
tion of interventions in multilevel contexts [26, 46]; and 
(3) PRISM with its multilevel consideration of determi -
nants was helpful in organizing multilevel influencers of 
implementation [59, 60].
There were six studies that included all six contex -
tual domains. Despite the RE-AIM outcomes being an 
explicit part of the original PRISM model (Fig.  1 and 
Table  3), only two studies directly connected individual 
PRISM domains with RE-AIM outcomes, and another 
four studies included RE-AIM outcomes without directly 
connecting them to the PRISM context domains. Even 
the two papers in which a connection between the con -
text domain and RE-AIM was made, the studies did 
not attempt to explicitly test relationships between the 
contextual factors and RE-AIM outcomes. Of the six 
studies that included RE-AIM, all but one addressed implementation, three addressed reach, three adoption at 
the staff and/or setting level, one included effectiveness, 
and one maintenance at the individual and setting level. 
One included all RE-AIM dimensions except effective -
ness and no studies included all five RE-AIM outcomes.
Few studies combined PRISM with another TMF (n=7) 
and even fewer described the adaptation of PRISM for 
the study context (n=2). TMFs that were used in com -
bination with PRISM included the expanded framework 
for reporting adaptations and modifications to evidence-
based interventions (FRAME) [65], the learning evalu -
ation [66], the Social Ecological Model [67], and Lean 
Six Sigma [68]. Adaptations to PRISM focused on the 
modifications of domains to align with the context of the 
study. Goplan et al. adapted and tailored PRISM to reflect 
the context of their 4Rs and 2Ss for strengthening fami -
lies intervention [45] and Knudsen et  al. modified how 
the implementation and sustainability infrastructure and 
external environment are structured based on their com -
munity and collation partners [47].
Discussion
PRISM was developed to specify multi-level contextual 
factors related to implementation research outcomes 
included in the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implemen -
tation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework [4 , 27, 69]. Our 
review summarized published reports of use of PRISM 
from 2002 to 2020 and attempted to report on findings 
related to relationships between PRISM contextual fac -
tors and RE-AIM outcomes. Nearly 200 articles refer -
enced PRISM, used it to inform or direct their research, 
or integrated it within the research design—with the num -
bers growing over the past decade. The studies reflected 
a diverse body of literature that applied PRISM across 
the stages of intervention planning, implementation, and 
evaluation. While 23 studies (represented by 32 articles) 
integrated PRISM within their research methodology, very 
few included PRISM contextual factors and RE-AIM out -
comes together. None made an explicit attempt to test the 
connection between contextual domains and RE-AIM out -
comes, making it difficult to determine the relationships 
between specific contextual constructs and unique imple -
mentation outcomes.
We noted that the purpose and use of PRISM varied 
across included studies and the level of specificity on 
how PRISM was integrated and measured was often lack -
ing, making it difficult to compare findings across stud -
ies. Similarly, it was challenging to rate the degree and 
quality of use of PRISM as there were few studies using 
or reporting on the PRISM sub-domains comprehen -
sively. More guidance on how to use PRISM especially 
as it relates to its sub-domains should be provided for 
future studies. Furthermore, measures should be linked 
Page 22 of 26 Rabin et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:62 
to specific PRISM domains and sub-domains to support a 
more comprehensive use of the model.
Studies that have integrated PRISM in their research 
methodology reflect a body of literature that is relatively 
early in its development. As a result, few studies reported 
using PRISM as a framework to describe potential rela -
tionships between context and outcomes. Indeed, many 
of the studies have used PRISM in planning and charac -
terizing dissemination and implementation settings and 
“recipients” (participants, implementers, and organi -
zations). A large proportion of these studies examined 
implementation and sustainability infrastructure issues 
when planning for intervention implementation. Explic -
itly reporting on this dimension is seen as one of the 
strengths of PRISM (explicit focus on this construct is 
relatively unique among context-oriented implementa -
tion science frameworks) and conceptually is likely to be 
strongly related to sustainment, although this remains 
to be tested. We were surprised to find that 78% of the 
studies addressed health equity in some way. This focus 
was primarily operationalized by the primary focus of 
the studies on underserved populations. We believe that 
the main reason for this high percentage of health equity 
focus is due to the focus of the RE-AIM outcomes on rep -
resentativeness which lends itself to health equity appli -
cations [20]. This trend should be further broadened to 
include the standard use of equity-related factors in each 
of the PRISM domains.
The application, operationalization, and assessment of 
every construct within PRISM including the implementa -
tion outcomes reflected in RE-AIM within a single study 
can be challenging [70]. Only a small percentage of origi -
nally identified articles met the criteria for the “integrated” 
use of PRISM. Given several new developments related to 
implications and use of RE-AIM to address equity issues, 
which is a key part of the PRISM framework, there is 
likely to be a lot more in the near future [27, 71–73]. Thus, 
it is timely to review what has been learned and to make 
recommendations for future applications of PRISM.
Key findings from our review are that (1) PRISM has 
been primarily used in outpatient clinical settings and in 
the US; (2) it has been used to study a variety of issues and 
conditions using a wide range of experimental designs 
and often using mixed methods; (3) most studies have 
reported on half or more of the PRISM domains and over 
half of the studies reported on at least 5 of the 6 domains; 
(4) PRISM contextual components most frequently 
assessed were the Program/Intervention characteristics 
from the organizational perspective, the Implementation 
and Sustainability Infrastructure, and the Organizational 
and Individual Recipient characteristics; (5) PRISM con -
textual components were most frequently operational -
ized using qualitative methods followed by quantitative, mixed-, and multi-method approaches; and (6) for the 
RE-AIM aspects of PRISM, the outcomes most often 
reported were Implementation and Maintenance.
Compared to the widespread use of RE-AIM, there 
has been a modest uptake of PRISM, especially until the 
last few years. There are multiple potential reasons for 
this finding including that the original article was not in 
a high-impact journal and was published before Open 
Access and citation services dramatically increased arti -
cle accessibility. Other reasons likely include that the 
National RE-AIM Working Group until very recently 
has not promoted PRISM and that it has not been taught 
as part of the major training programs in D&I science. 
Finally, to date, most studies have treated PRISM and RE-
AIM as separate frameworks rather than reporting them 
as directly related, and PRISM as being an expansion of 
RE-AIM [27, 71, 74]. These findings present both a need 
and an opportunity for future researchers to better incor -
porate the full PRISM framework into their studies. In 
this review, only six of the 23 studies included any RE-
AIM outcomes, despite these outcomes being an explicit 
part of the original model (Table  3). More consistent 
inclusion of RE-AIM outcomes would also allow for 
more robust assessments of how PRISM domains impact 
implementation outcomes, including formal mediation 
or moderation analysis.
We found that due to the lack of consistency and spec -
ificity in the use of PRISM and reporting on the opera -
tionalization of the PRISM domains, it was challenging 
to synthesize information across studies on the contri -
butions of PRISM to support planning, implementa -
tion, and evaluation. When reviewing the eight studies 
that identified specific lessons learned about the use of 
PRISM, we noted that these studies found PRISM useful 
in supporting planning, implementation, and evaluation 
efforts especially due its multilevel, contextual orienta -
tion. More comprehensive and proactive use of PRISM in 
future studies will allow the broader analysis and synthe -
sis of conclusions and lessons learned.
Strengths and limitations
This review has both strengths and limitations. Limita -
tions include that the review was limited to English lan -
guage reports and to published research. It is possible that 
creative work and important examples of cultural adap -
tations using PRISM may have been missed with these 
decisions. The resulting 23 studies, while a large enough 
sample to draw conclusions and suggest directions for 
future application, is too small to conduct meta-analyses 
or draw definitive conclusions. Furthermore, our review 
relied on the initial classification of papers regarding 
the use of PRISM based on the information provided in 
the published papers that were identified through our 
Page 23 of 26
 Rabin et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:62 
 
multi-step search and validation process. It is possible 
that contacting the corresponding authors of these papers 
could have yielded more information about the use and 
resulted in different classification of these papers (e.g., 
‘integrated’ instead of ‘directed’ use). This paper was also 
solely focused on describing pattern of use for studies 
that were classified as integrated use. Future papers could 
explore how PRISM and other TMFs have been used I n 
Framing and Directed studies. Finally, studies provided 
less consistent information on the operationalization 
of each PRISM domain which limited our ability to sys -
tematically report and synthesize information about this 
aspect. In this paper, we were able to include information 
about the methods used to operationalize domains and 
the most frequent techniques used for data collection.
Strengths of this review include following PRISMA rec -
ommendations and reporting standards; the use of mul -
tiple reviewers and coders at all review stages; and the 
use of the application categories previously developed by 
Field et al. [29] to justify and explain exclusions. We also 
used multiple search strategies, including reverse cita -
tion approaches and recommendations from prominent 
investigators- these proved effective in increasing the 
number of relevant articles.
Next steps and recommendations
We summarize key recommendations for research and 
practice directions:
For research, we recommend:
1. The development and validation of more quantitative 
measures of PRISM, especially those that meet prag -
matic [75] and the PAPERS [76] criteria. This will 
allow greater mixed-methods research on PRISM 
and understanding of various linkages.
2. The use of common and where applicable, standard -
ized PRISM definitions, assessments, and criteria. 
We note examples of mixed methods research with 
PRISM, including survey and qualitative interview 
guides as well as a new interactive PRSIM assessment 
and feedback tool that will soon be available on the 
re-aim.org website.
3. While preferred to advance implementation science, 
for pragmatic use it is not necessary to use all PRISM 
components or to use PRISM at all program time points 
(i.e., pre-implementation, implementation, sustainment 
[70]). When not feasible, authors should briefly and 
transparently state why certain components were not 
used or why PRISM was only used at one time point.
4. More investigations and transparent reporting are 
needed that (a) compare PRISM with other TMFs and 
create clear cross-walks between PRISM and other TMFs; (b) combine PRSIM with other models; and (c) 
adapt PRISM to diverse contexts and content areas.
5. Patient and community member issues involving (a) 
characteristics components of PRISM can be high -
lighted more; including especially social determinants 
of health and other equity-related issues; and (b) per -
ceptions of the beneficiary of the intervention (e.g., 
patient-centeredness, trialability, relative advantage/etc.)
6. Consider using PRISM in more diverse settings includ -
ing community, school, worksite, and other non-clini -
cal contexts, especially including low resource settings 
and low- and middle-income countries.
For implementation practice, we recommend:
1. Reports on how PRISM is used with different types 
of implementation partners, in multi-sector research, 
and for team science, including the time involved and 
lessons learned.
2. Use of PRISM in logic models and to develop par -
ticipatory implementation strategies that can help to 
address priority outcomes.
3. As discussed in the section on clarification, reviewing 
PRISM terminology to make it more user-friendly 
and relevant to the context of the implementation 
practice—for example changing some terms such as 
“patients” or “recipients. ”
4. Development and usability evaluations of interactive 
tools and resources including videos that illustrate 
and guide PRISM use.
Conclusions
Although initial uptake of PRISM was slow after its ini -
tial publication in 2008, usage has increased and over 
50 studies were published in 2019 and the most of 2020. 
While there are opportunities to further expand inte -
grated use of PRISM and more explicit reports on linkage 
to RE-AIM outcomes, this review has produced learnings 
and recommendations for future directions. It is hoped 
this publication will encourage more sophisticated use 
and reporting on PRISM to inform both research and 
practice on contextual factors in implementation.
