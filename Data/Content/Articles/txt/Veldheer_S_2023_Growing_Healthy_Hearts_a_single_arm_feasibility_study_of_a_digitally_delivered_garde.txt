Abstract 
Background Food gardening may positively influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk ‑related behaviors. However, 
the vast majority of existing gardening interventions have used an in‑person delivery model which has limitations 
for scalability. It is not known whether a digitally delivered gardening intervention would be feasible or acceptable 
to participants. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of a digitally delivered gardening interven‑
tion in three domains: participant acceptability, demand, and practicality.
Methods A single ‑arm, pre ‑post ‑study design was used. Participants (n = 30) were aged 20 + with no plans to gar ‑
den in the coming season and had at least 1 CVD risk factor. The intervention included ten 1‑h video ‑conferencing 
sessions, written materials, and access to a study website. Content focused on gardening skills, cooking skills, 
and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Feasibility outcomes included acceptability (post ‑
program ratings), demand (session attendance rate), and practicality (ability to start a garden and grow F&V). The 
study was considered feasible if the following criteria were met: ≥ 70% rated the intervention as good or excellent, 
overall session attendance rate was ≥ 70%, and > 70% were able to start a garden and grow F&V. We also assessed pre ‑
post-program changes in behavioral mediators (gardening confidence, gardening enjoyment, cooking confidence, 
and nutrition knowledge). Descriptive statistics were calculated. Pre ‑post differences were evaluated with means 
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Effect sizes were calculated (Cohen’s d).
Results All feasibility criteria were met. A total of 93.3% of participants rated the intervention as good or excellent, 
96% started a garden and grew F&V, and the overall session attendance rate was 81%. The largest mean pre ‑post 
changes were in gardening confidence (pre 7.1 [95% CI: 6.4, 7.9], post 9.0 [95% CI: 8.6, 9.5], Cohen’s d = 1.15), garden‑
ing enjoyment (pre: 6.3 [95% CI: 5.9, 6.7], post: 7.5 [95% CI: 7.1, 7.9], Cohen’s d = 1.69), and cooking self‑ efficacy (pre: 4.7 
[95% CI: 4.3, 5.1], post: 7.7 [95% CI: 7.3, 8.0], Cohen’s d = 3.0).

Key messages regarding feasibility
• The vast majority of gardening-related interventions 
have been delivered using in-person delivery modali -
ties. It is unknown if a digitally delivered intervention 
would be acceptable and feasible for adults with risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease.
• This study found that a digitally delivered gardening 
intervention was feasible in three domains including 
acceptability measured by post-program participant 
evaluation, demand for the intervention as measured 
by overall attendance rate, and practicality as meas -
ured by the ability of participants to start a garden 
and grow fruits and vegetables.
• The findings from this study support the need for 
further evaluation of the Growing Healthy Hearts 
gardening intervention using a randomized con -
trolled trial design.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of pre -
mature death in the USA [1]. Healthy lifestyle behaviors 
such as fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake and adequate 
physical activity can reduce the risk of premature CVD-
related mortality by 12–23% [2, 3]. However, the num -
ber of Americans who report meeting the minimum 
daily requirements of 5 F&V servings/day is low at just 
12% [4]. Similarly, just 23% meet recommended levels of 
aerobic physical activity (PA) and muscle-strengthening 
activities [5]. These data suggest that new and innovative 
interventions are needed to influence the multiple health 
behaviors that impact CVD risk.
One possible intervention that could contribute to bet -
ter CVD health status is food gardening (herein referred 
to as gardening). Observational studies have found that 
gardeners are 2–3 times more likely than non-garden -
ers to consume at least 5 servings of F&V/day [6, 7]. In 
addition, gardening includes several moderate to vig -
orous intensity physical activities from walking (meta -
bolic equivalent task [MET] 3.0), to raking (MET  3.8), to 
digging (MET  5.0), and pushing a wheel barrow (MET  
5.5) [8]. Taken together, these data provide support for 
the idea that teaching gardening may be a reasonable intervention strategy to help adults with CVD risk fac -
tors meet recommended F&V intake and physical activity 
goals.
Currently, the vast majority of research on the benefits 
of gardening is observational [9, 10]. In addition, despite 
the potential application of gardening for CVD risk 
reduction, the only published randomized controlled tri -
als (RCTs) that prospectively teach gardening skills have 
been conducted in two specialized populations: school-
aged children [11, 12] and adult cancer survivors [13, 
14]. Furthermore, these studies have all used in-person 
delivery modes which can present participation barriers 
such as the need for transportation and child care [15, 
16]. Digitally delivered interventions can address partici -
pation barriers and increase the potential for large-scale 
dissemination. To our knowledge, there are no digitally 
delivered gardening interventions specifically designed to 
address health outcomes or CVD risk in adults.
We previously developed an in-person, multiple behav -
ior change gardening intervention designed to impact 
dietary intake of F&V and PA among adults with risk fac -
tors for CVD [17]. Recognizing the limitations of the in-
person intervention delivery model, and with the goal of 
increasing future scalability, the intervention was adapted 
to be digitally delivered via video-conferencing (Zoom) 
and web-based materials. Prior to moving to a rand -
omized trial, pilot testing is necessary to assess whether a 
digitally delivered gardening intervention would be feasi -
ble or acceptable to adults with CVD risk factors. There -
fore, we conducted a single-arm pilot study to assess 
feasibility in three domains as outlined by Bowen et  al. 
[18]: acceptability, demand, and practicality. In addition, 
we assessed preliminary outcomes for pre-post changes 
in F&V intake, PA, and other behavioral factors.
Methods
Study design, participants, and intervention
This was a prospective, 21-week, single-arm pre-post-
study design with outcomes assessed at baseline, mid -
point, and follow-up. Adults aged 20 + years who 
attended a primary care clinic in Hershey, PA, USA, in 
the past year were invited to the study via email. Inter -
ested participants were screened over the phone between 
March 30, 2021, date and April 21, 2021. Eligible partici -
pants were those who: (1) had no plans to start or tend a

garden in the coming season and (2) had a self-reported 
history of at least one of the following cardiovascular 
risk factors: body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25  kg/m2, hyper -
lipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, current or past 
tobacco use, and family history of heart attack before age 
50. Additional criteria included access to reliable Inter -
net and access to garden space (in ground, raised beds, 
or pots; at home or a community garden). When screen -
ing for space, the study team member discussed all pos -
sible locations that the participant had access to, and they 
were included if this was any 1, or a combination of, con -
tainers, raised beds, in the ground, or a plot at a commu -
nity garden. Once eligibility was established, participants 
provided written consent for study participation using 
an institutional review board (IRB)-approved remote consent process that used a combination of REDCap and 
videoconferencing. Details of participant flow through 
the study are presented in Fig. 1.
In terms of sample size, one reason to conduct a pilot 
study is for the study team to test the trial procedures. 
In the present study, this included digital intervention 
delivery in addition to remote consenting and data col -
lection [19]. Because of the seasonal nature of gardening, 
we used a cohort group structure where all participants 
enrolled, completed data collection, and engaged in the 
intervention at the same time points. Therefore, the sam -
ple size of 30 was chosen for 3 reasons of practicality [19, 
20]: (1) this group size was the maximum considered 
operationally feasible for simultaneous participant data 
collection at each time point, (2) it was reasonable for

managing participants during the live video-conferencing 
sessions, and (3) this is an acceptable number needed to 
demonstrate participant acceptability, demand, and feasi -
bility [19, 21–23].
The majority of the intervention sessions focused on 
gardening skills. However, the cooking and nutrition 
education assisted participants with a full lifecycle over -
view of gardening as a healthy lifestyle activity encom -
passing growing, preparing, cooking, and eating fresh 
F&V (i.e., garden to plate). The theoretical framework 
guiding the intervention was social cognitive theory 
(SCT) and self-determination theory (SDT) [24, 25]. 
Social cognitive theory suggests that knowledge and self-
efficacy are important psychosocial mediators of health 
behavior change [25, 26]. In this case, nutrition knowl -
edge and cooking self-efficacy were targeted due to their 
associations with better overall diet quality [27]. In addi -
tion, SDT suggests that when people are able to maintain 
behaviors for the long term, it is due to internal motiva -
tion via psychosocial need satisfaction. Internal motiva -
tion is increased when people have autonomy and feel 
competent in performing behaviors. This in turn contrib -
utes to feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction [24, 28, 29]. 
Therefore, the mediators targeted were gardening enjoy -
ment and gardening confidence.
The intervention included ten 1-h videoconferencing 
sessions via Zoom (7 gardening focused and 3 cooking 
focused). Although the intervention was delivered digi -
tally, participants engaged in the gardening and cooking 
activities in their own gardens and kitchens. All garden -
ing sessions included 10–15 min with a registered dieti -
tian (SV) presenting on topics such as using the Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [30–32], 
MyPlate, portion sizes, grocery shopping, meal planning, 
and label reading. Prior to starting the sessions, par -
ticipants were mailed 2 hard-copy booklets (1 nutrition 
focused and 1 gardening focused). Because soil nutrient 
composition and Ph are important for gardening suc -
cess, all participants also received a prepaid (US $9.00) 
soil test kit from the Penn State Extension. Instructions 
for taking the sample, sending it to the lab for analysis, 
and interpreting the results were provided as part of the 
gardening instruction. Sessions were conducted in three 
phases. Phase 1 included 5 weekly sessions with Penn 
State Extension certified Master Gardeners. Training for 
a Master Gardener certification in Pennsylvania includes 
40  h of classroom instruction, passing a written exam, 
and completing 50  h of garden-focused service. Topics 
for the sessions included the following: gardening skills 
to assist the participants with identifying a garden site 
(in ground, in containers, raised beds, or in a commu -
nity garden), preparing the site for planting, tool safety, 
general planting (spring and summer gardens), garden maintenance, and pest control. Phase II, held biweekly, 
included three cook-along sessions where participants 
were provided a DASH diet-appropriate, garden pro -
duce-focused recipe in advance and were invited to cook 
along with a culinary medicine dietitian (OW). These 
sessions focused on incorporating garden produce and 
herbs into basic meals such as sandwiches, salad or grain 
bowls, and stir fries, or pasta dishes. The last two sessions 
during Phase III were held monthly, and Master Gar -
deners focused on starting a fall garden, storing the har -
vest, and garden cleanup. Each session began and ended 
with a question and answer period where participants 
were encouraged to share their successes and challenges 
with the group. During the study, participants received 
access to a study website that included additional materi -
als on topics covered during the sessions (i.e., gardening 
instructional videos, DASH nutrition information, and 
healthy recipes).
Based on the TIDieR checklist and the behavior change 
wheel [33, 34], details about the intervention are pre -
sented in Table  1 including the intervention components, 
intervention functions, content, content delivery modes, 
time spent, and who presented each session.
Participants were compensated US $160 for their study 
participation which included US $20 for completing sur -
veys at each time point and an additional US $100 which 
could be used to purchase gardening supplies. This study 
was approved by the Penn State University IRB (protocol 
no. 17020).
Measures
Participants completed Research Electronic Data Cap -
ture (REDCap) surveys at each of the three timepoints 
(baseline, midpoint 10  weeks, and follow-up 21  weeks) 
over 21 weeks in 2021 (April-September). The post-pro -
gram acceptability rating was assessed with the question 
“Overall, how would you rate the gardening program 
that you participated in?” Acceptability was defined 
as ≥ 70% of participants rating the intervention as good/
excellent (vs. satisfactory/poor). Demand was based on 
overall attendance rate with a goal of 70% participation. 
This conservative approach for attendance takes into 
consideration all possible participants (n = 30) attend -
ing all possible sessions (n = 10) and is calculated as the 
total attendance for all sessions (actual)/the maximum 
possible for all sessions (300). Individual session attend -
ance was also assessed as the number and percent who 
attended at least 7 sessions (i.e., received 70% of the 
intervention). Practicality was assessed post-program, 
and participants were asked to rate, on a scale from 1 
(disagree) to 10 (agree), to what degree they were able 
to “start a garden” and “grow fruits and vegetables. ” The 
intervention would be considered practical if at least 
Page 5 of 11
 Veldheer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:152 
 
70% of participants provided a high rating of ≥ 8 for both 
questions. An additional practicality measure using the 
same scale was used to assess 10 key gardening program 
activities with a goal of least 70% of participants provid -
ing a high rating (≥ 8) for 7 of 10 activities including the 
following: choosing a site; completing a soil test; starting 
a spring, summer, and fall garden; weekly garden tending; 
controlling pests; weeding; harvesting; and incorporat -
ing garden produce into meals. Areas for programmatic 
improvement were solicited in a post-program recorded 
video-conferencing exit interview where participants 
were asked, “If we did this program again, what do you 
think should be done differently and why?” .
PA was assessed using the International Physical Activ -
ity Questionnaire (IPAQ) long form [35]. Standard ana -
lytical guidelines were used to estimate PA in MET 
minutes (minutes of activity × the assigned MET value for 
each reported activity) [35]. Dietary intake was measured 
with the 26-item National Health and Nutrition Exami -
nation Survey (NHANES) dietary screener questionnaire 
(DSQ) [36]. The NHANES DSQ analytical guidelines 
were used to generate estimates for daily servings of F&V 
without French fries (cup equivalents), fiber (grams), 
dairy (cups), total and added sugars (teaspoons), whole grains (grams), and calcium (mg) [36]. Due to a techni -
cal error, this measure was only collected at baseline 
and follow-up. Cooking confidence was measured with 
the Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale (CAF -
PAS) functional sub-scale, a 13-item questionnaire which 
assesses an individual’s self-perceived cooking confi -
dence using a 7-point scale (1 = disagree and 7 = agree) 
[37]. Nutrition knowledge was assessed with 25 ques -
tions from two domains of the General Nutrition Knowl -
edge Questionnaire (dietary recommendations and food 
groups) [38]. Questions in these domains were modified 
to align with DASH diet and MyPlate recommendations. 
Each correct answer was summed for a total score of 25 
with higher scores indicating higher nutrition knowledge. 
Gardening enjoyment was assessed using a modified 
CAFPAS attitudes sub-scale (10 items) where references 
to cooking were replaced with gardening [37]. Questions 
asked participants to indicate to what degree they agree 
(1 = disagree to 7 = agree) with statements related to per -
sonal fulfillment and enjoyment such as “I find gardening 
a very fulfilling activity” or “Compared to other activi -
ties, gardening brings me little enjoyment. ” Five items for 
gardening confidence (10-point scale, 1 = not at all confi -
dent, 10 = very confident) were used to assess confidence Table 1 Growing Healthy Hearts digitally delivered gardening intervention description for each component

in the following: starting a garden, watering, growing 
produce from seed, growing produce from established 
plants, and harvesting. Questions were summed and 
reported as a mean score. Mental health was assessed 
with the PROMIS depression and anxiety scales (pre -
sented as t-scores) [39, 40] and the Perceived Stress 
Scale [41]. Participants were also asked (yes/no), “Would 
you recommend this program to family or friends” and 
“would you consider growing a garden next season?” .
Data analysis
Summary statistics were calculated for quantitative data. 
Changes in behavioral outcomes from baseline to each 
timepoint were assessed with means and 95% confidence 
intervals. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS 
statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, 
USA). For qualitative interviews, a codebook was devel -
oped, and improvements for a future intervention were 
coded by 2 study team members (Cohen’s kappa = 0.83) 
using NVivo version 12 (QSR International, Melbourne, 
Australia). Codes were grouped into themes and organ -
ized by intervention component (gardening, cooking, 
nutrition education).
Results
Baseline participant sociodemographic and health char -
acteristics (n = 30) are presented in Table  2. The sample 
was majority white and female, and the highest propor -
tion of CVD risk factors was high BMI, hypercholester -
olemia, and hypertension.
Follow-up data were collected on 29/30 participants 
(96.6% follow-up rate). Feasibility criteria for each 
domain are presented in Table  3. Predetermined crite -
ria were met or exceeded for each domain (acceptability, 
demand, and practicality). In terms of overall program 
acceptability and future intentions, 100% of participants 
(n = 29) reported both that they would recommend the 
program to family or friends, and that they would con -
sider growing a garden next season. In terms of individual 
session attendance, 26/30 participants (86.6%) attended 
at least 7 sessions. For individual gardening activities, the 
three items that had the lowest ratings were starting a 
spring garden, a fall garden, and completing the soil test.
Changes in behavioral mediators and health out -
comes from baseline to each timepoint are presented in 
Table  4. The largest mean pre-post changes were in gar -
dening confidence, gardening enjoyment, and cooking 
self-efficacy.
Results of the exit interviews (n = 26), including partici -
pant recommendations for each intervention component 
and illustrative quotes, are presented in Table  5. Par -
ticipants recommended Master Gardener presentations include in-garden skills demonstrations and a slower 
pace for the cooking demonstrations. They also suggested 
more group interaction (either online or in person); more 
advanced skills training for specific gardening, cooking, Table 2 Growing Healthy Hearts participant demographic and

three domains: acceptability, demand, and practicality. 
The digitally delivered intervention had an acceptability 
rating that was similar to the existing in-person version 
(93% rated highly) [17]. In addition, we had a high attend -
ance rate over the 21-week study period, and participants 
were able to complete a range of garden to plate activities 
including site selection, planting, harvesting, and eating 
fresh produce from their gardens. Results of this study 
suggest that a digitally delivered version of the interven -
tion can be used in the future to increase the potential for 
scale and reach.
To the authors’ knowledge, this report is the first 
digitally delivered gardening intervention designed to 
improve health outcomes. With a focus specifically on 
CVD, we found evidence that a gardening intervention 
could be a tool to impact health through behavioral medi -
ators including gardening enjoyment and confidence and 
cooking self-efficacy. There was also a moderate to high 
positive effect on F&V intake (Cohen’s d = 0.73) which is 
known to influence CVD risk [9, 42–44]. Epidemiologic 
studies have found an inverse, dose relationship between 
CVD mortality and F&V intake [2] with estimates sug -
gesting a 4% reduction in CVD mortality for each addi -
tional serving of F&V consumed (up to 5 servings per 
day) [45]. Similarly, there is a linear dose relationship 
between time spent engaged in PA of any intensity and 
CVD risk reduction [3]. The effect on PA at the 21-week 
follow-up was nonsignificantly small (Cohen’s d = 0.13). 
However, given that gardening has been found to impact 
both diet and PA [6, 7, 13, 14, 46], further examination is 
warranted to assess whether it could impact these health 
outcomes in a larger sample of adults with one or more 
CVD risk factors.
The findings from this study are broadly consistent 
with the adult-focused gardening interventions in cancer 
survivors despite them being delivered using in-person 
modalities [13, 14]. For instance, Bail et  al. randomized 82 breast cancer survivors with low baseline F&V intake 
(< 5 servings/day) and PA (< 150  min/week) into an in-
person Master Gardener mentored (1:1) home garden-
based intervention (n = 42) versus a wait-list control 
(n = 36) [14]. Compared to baseline, at follow-up, inter -
vention participants had a 0.86 serving/day increase in 
vegetables (p < 0.001) and an increase in PA of 14  min/
week (p = 0.34). Like the present study, Bail et al. also had 
a high acceptability rating (100%) with all participants 
indicating a willingness to garden in the next season. The 
authors concluded that gardening programs offer an inte -
grated approach to improving health behaviors and that 
larger studies are needed to confirm these results.
There are many studies that have demonstrated the 
benefits of gardening on mental health [9, 10, 47]. In 
the present digitally delivered intervention, we found 
small to moderate effects on depression outcomes based 
on self-reported measures (Cohen’s d = 0.32). Mecha -
nisms for why gardening may impact mental health are 
unclear, although there is an emerging body of literature 
which supports the idea that exposure to nature, or feel -
ings of wonder and awe, may play a role in better men -
tal and physical health [48, 49]. Although the evidence 
is mixed, it is possible there is a seasonal effect on men -
tal health symptoms [50–52]. Since the baseline mental 
health measures were collected in late winter/early spring 
(March/April) and follow-up measures were collected in 
the late summer (August/September), parallel-group ran -
domized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate 
this issue.
From the perspective of health equity and health dis -
parities, the need for garden space could be viewed as 
a limitation. However, scholars and community organ -
izers consider gardening to be both a means of per -
sonally procuring low-cost F&V (food justice) and 
a tool for promoting health equity and social justice 
[53–56]. This is in part because gardens are inherently Table 5 Participant future program recommendations with illustrative quotes from post ‑program exit interviews
Gardening component
Consider hybrid or in-person sessions: “I would prefer hybrid or all in person”; “Get together and actually see a garden live”
Add educational content: “More help with the tools”; “More time spent on pests and pest control”
Add skills training: “A garden planner to plot out the garden”
Include in-garden demonstrations: “Have master gardeners in the garden instead of in their living room”
Provide more opportunities for group interaction: “Meet the people that you’re in a community with to get advice”
Cooking component
Provide recipe swaps and substitutions: “Have some substitutions for those with allergies…Or if you don’t like this, you can use this”
Conduct cook-along at a slower pace: “I didn’t cook along. I didn’t move fast enough to do that”
Add more advanced cooking skills: “Some sessions were on the elementary side for someone [experienced with cooking]”
Nutrition education component
Offer more advanced nutrition topics: “I don’t know if I really learned anything new about nutrition. It reinforced the things that I should be doing, 
like less sodium”
Incorporate more cultural diversity: “The nutrition presentations were generic. It didn’t get much diversity of people’s backgrounds”

flexible in terms of space (in ground, raised beds, con -
tainers, community gardens) and the produce that can 
be grown which supports individual autonomy and 
cultural diversity. In our program, Master Gardeners 
offered growing techniques for participant-chosen gar -
den spaces while also offering strategies to accommo -
date different physical abilities (i.e., tall raised beds to 
eliminate the need to stoop or bend, ergonomic tools 
for better grip). Furthermore, participants chose what 
they wanted to grow, and the cooking sessions provided 
suggestions for swapping ingredients based on their 
preferences (although participants wanted more of this 
in the future).
This study has some limitations. First, it had a small 
sample size and no control group so conclusions about 
efficacy are not appropriate. A larger, adequately pow -
ered randomized controlled trial is necessary to fully 
assess the influence of gardening on CVD-related 
health behaviors and risk. Second, participants in the 
present study were selected based on a variety of CVD 
risk factors but not baseline dietary intake or physi -
cal activity levels. Thus, some participants may have 
already been consuming high levels of F&V or engaged 
in adequate PA, and this may have limited the amount 
of change that could be detected at follow-up. Future 
studies should include only participants who have low 
baseline levels of F&V intake and PA in addition to 
other CVD-risk factors. In terms of dietary outcomes, 
they were self-reported and were not measured at the 
midpoint due to a technical error. Objective measures 
of dietary intake such as plasma carotenoids, or more 
intensive device-based physical activity measures, 
would increase the rigor of future work. More frequent 
measurements of both dietary intake and PA would 
assist in providing a picture of how these outcomes 
may change over the course of the garden season. For 
our practically measures, participant responses were 
skewed to the high and low ends of the 10-point scale. 
This suggests that a dichotomous (yes/no) measure may 
be better for assessing these activities in a future trial. 
Finally, while digitally delivered interventions provide 
access to those who may have limited ability to travel, 
they do necessitate access to the internet which is an 
inherent limitation. No one screened for this study was 
excluded due to inability to access the Internet.
Despite these limitations, this study had several 
strengths. It had a high participant retention rate 
(96.6%), and it established the feasibility of a digitally 
delivered, integrated gardening, cooking, and nutrition 
education curriculum which provides a full-lifecycle, 
garden-to-plate perspective for engaging in healthy life -
style behaviors. In addition, the systematic reporting of 
qualitative post-program participant recommendations represents a significant strength that will improve the 
future intervention. Areas of focus will include improv -
ing intervention activities for gardening activities that 
participants were less likely to achieve (spring garden, 
fall garden, soil test) and specific participant-identified 
content areas.
Conclusion
A digitally delivered, multiple behavior change gardening 
intervention for adults with CVD risk factors was feasi -
ble, acceptable to participants, and they had meaningful 
changes in behavioral mediators. The next steps are to 
refine the intervention based on participant recommen -
dations and test it in a future randomized controlled trial.
