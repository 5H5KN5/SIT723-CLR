Abstract
Background: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has undertaken a major initiative to transform care through
implementation of Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Based on the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) concept,
PACT aims to improve access, continuity, coordination, and comprehensiveness using team-based care that is
patient-driven and patient-centered. However, how VA should adapt PACT to meet the needs of special populations,
such as women Veterans (WVs), was not considered in initial implementation guidance. WVs ’numerical minority in VA
healthcare settings (approximately 7 –8 % of users) creates logistical chall enges to delivering gender-sensitive
comprehensive care. The main goal of this study is to te st an evidence-based quality improvement approach
(EBQI) to tailoring PACT to meet the needs of WVs, incorp orating comprehensive primary care services and
gender-specific care in gender-sensitive environments, thereby accelerating achievement of PACT tenets for women
(Women ’s Health (WH)-PACT).
Methods/design: EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multilevel research-clinical partnership that engages
senior organizational leaders and local quality improvement (QI) teams in adapting and implementing new care
models in the context of prior evidence and local practice conditions, with researchers providing technical support,
formative feedback, and practice facilitation. In a 12-site cluster randomized trial, we will evaluate WH-PACT model
achievement using patient, provider, staff, and practice surveys, in addition to analyses of secondary administrative and
chart-based data. We will explore impacts of receipt of WH-PACT care on quality of chronic disease care and
prevention, health status, patient satisfaction and experie nce of care, provider experience, utilization, and costs.
Using mixed methods, we will assess pre-post practice contexts; document EBQI activities undertaken in
participating facilities and their relationship to provider/staff and team actions/attitudes; document WH-PACT
implementation; and examine barriers/facilitators to EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation through a
combination of semi-structured interviews and monthly fo rmative progress narratives and administrative data.

Discussion: Lack of gender-sensitive comprehensive care has demonstrated consequences for the technical
quality and ratings of care among WVs and may contribute to decisions to continue use or seek care elsewhere
under the US Affordable Care Act. We hypothesize that tailoring PACT implementation through EBQI may
improve the experience and quality of care at many levels.

Background
Women Veterans ’(WVs) numerical minority in Veterans
Health Administration (VA) healthcare settings has created
logistical challenges to delivering gender-sensitive compre-
hensive primary care (PC). Women commonly must access
an array of VA and non-VA providers, usually requiring
multiple separate visits, to achieve the same basic level of
care which male veterans can achieve through a single on-
site PC visit [1 –3]. The VA has invested in a variety of re-
sources intended to improve WVs ’care, establishing
women ’s health clinics, designating Women ’sH e a l t h( W H )
PC providers with the requisite training/experience, and
contracting with non-VA obstetrics and gynecology ser-
vices. Despite these investments, WVs ’quality of care in
VA continues to lag behind that of male veterans [4]. Con-
tributing to these outcomes is the lack of gender sensitivity
prevalent in many VA care settings, which may be linked
to low WV retention rates in VA care [5, 6].
The VA has undertaken a major initiative to transform
care through mandated implementation of Patient Aligned
Care Teams (PACTs), which hold promise for addressing
many of the gaps in WVs ’care. The PACT model is based
on the concept of patient-centered medical homes
(PCMHs), widely endorsed by PC professional societies
and shown to improve quality of care and patient, pro-
vider, and staff satisfaction, while reducing costs [7, 8].
PACT focuses on development of high-performing “team-
lets”comprised of PC providers, nurses, and administra-
tive support who together manage care of a defined panel
of patients. These teamlets operate within a larger team
that includes, for example, pharmacists, social workers,
mental health (MH) providers, and dietitians, and link to
specialists and hospital care in their medical “neighbor-
hood. ”Through these teams/teamlets, PACT aims to
achieve improvements in accessibility, continuity, coordin-
ation, and comprehensiveness using team-based care that
is patient-driven and patient-centered [9]. These improve-
ments, in turn, should translate into better chronic illness
care and prevention and lower costs.
However, how VA should adapt this major reorganization
to meet the needs of special populations, such as
WVs, is yet to be fully worked out. The PACT model
itself does not include specific accommodations forgender-specific care or improved gender sensitivity.
Current WV care is also out of step with PACT pri-
orities and emphasis on “one-stop shopping ”for care
[10]. For example, WVs are more likely to be out-
sourced to the community for gender-specific services
now than they were 10 years ago, and, while the
number of women ’s clinics is up, over 40 % do not
deliver comprehensive PC [3]. Therefore, improving
VA PC alone or “beefing up ”women ’s clinics is un-
likely to achieve what an integrated WH-PACT model
must reconcile to improve care for WVs and thereby
reduce persistent gender disparities in VA care [11, 12].
Research aims
We propose to use evidence-based quality improvement
(EBQI) in the context of the Chronic Care Model to de-
velop and test achievement of WH-PACT in a cluster
randomized trial [13, 14]. EBQI is a systematic approach
to developing local research-clinical partnerships to pro-
duce tailored, evidence-based care models or redesigns
[15]. The resulting WH-PACT redesign will make use of
local WH resources (e.g., women ’s clinics, designated
providers), while linking them to the broader PACT initia-
tive and medical center resources. We will also explore
the extent to which receiving care that meets WH-PACT
tenets translates into higher value (better quality, lower
costs) for individual WVs, evaluate local implementa-
tion, and develop tools for sustaining and spreading
WH-PACT.
Our aims are:
1.To assess the effectiveness of EBQI for developing a
WH-PACT model using a cluster randomized trial
design . WH-PACT model achievement includes (a)
PACT features (accessible, continuous, coordinated,
team-based, patient-driven, and patient-centered),
(b)comprehensive WH care (PC, gender-specific
care, and integrated MH), and (c) gender-sensitive
care delivery . We will (a) survey providers/staff on
achievement of WH-PACT model attributes, (b)
survey WV patients on WH-PACT model care
experiences, and (c) analyze WH-PACT achievement
(e.g., continuity) using secondary data.Yano et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:101 Page 2 of 14
2.To examine impacts of receipt of WH-PACT concordant
care on WVs ’outcomes.
We will explore impacts on quality of chronic
disease care and prevention, health status, utilization
and costs.
3.To evaluate the processes of EBQI-supported WH-PACT
implementation . We will assess pre-post practice
contexts; document EBQI activities and their
relationship to provider/staff and team actions and
attitudes; document WH-PACT implementation;
and examine barriers and facilitators to EBQI-
supported WH-PACT implementation using mixed
methods (e.g., semi-structured interviews, brief
progress narratives).
4.To develop implementation and evaluation tools for
use in EBQI-supported WH-PACT model adaptation ,
implementation ,sustainability ,and spread to
additional VA facilities .
Methods/design
Setting, site selection, trial design, and participants
The VA healthcare system is currently organized into 21
regional Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs),
with administrative and clinical authority over VA med-
ical centers (VAMCs) and their affiliated programs in
geographically distinct regions of the USA [16].
Study sites are members of the VA Women ’s Health
Practice-Based Research Network (WH-PBRN), a
37-VAMC network spanning 17 VISNs and comprising
over 270 geographically distinct sites of care and nearly
600 designated WH providers [17]. Together, PBRN facil-
ities serve over 100,000 WVs (about one third of WVs
seen in VA) and span diverse patient populations. We
identified five VISNs with three or more WH-PBRN sites;
we excluded one that was already participating in a
VISN-wide EBQI stepped-wedge trial. We approached
leadership at the other four VISNs and their WH-PBRN
member site leads about study participation. All agreed
to participate. One VISN dropped out ahead of
randomization, which was replaced with a VISN that
had two WH-PBRN sites; we then worked with VISN
leadership to identify a third non-PBRN VAMC, which
subsequently joined the WH-PBRN (since the trial
began, the WH-PBRN has expanded to 60 VAMCs in
20 of 21 VISNs). VAMCs participating in the trial span
nine states (Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
and Wisconsin).
This study is designed as a parallel two-arm, cluster
randomized controlled trial (cRCT), blocked on VISN
(Fig. 1). We randomly assigned the 12 VAMCs to EBQI
or usual PACT implementation in an unbalanced 2:1 ratio
within VISN, supporting appraisal of variations in EBQI
implementation in the context of differences of VISNgeography, resources, and oversight (Fig. 1). No site strati-
fication or matching criteria were used. The study biostat-
istician used www.randomization.com with a randomized
permuted block of three (simple block of three VAMCs
within each VISN) and a seed of 15,356 to start the
random allocation sequence. The eight intervention
VAMCs will engage in EBQI, while the four control
VAMCs will receive standard PACT and WH care de-
livery handbooks and guidance that all VA facilities re-
ceive. The study biostatistician assigned the VAMCs to
EBQI or control, while the study PI (EMY) enrolled
and launched EBQI with the resulting eight VAMCs.
Local quality improvement (QI) teams, their WH and
PC leaders, and VAMC facility leadership, as well as
VISN leaders and other key stakeholders (e.g., national
VA partners), will be the focus of this study, given their
varying levels of responsibility for WH, primary care, and
PACT implementation. Outcomes for the PC providers
and WVs seen in each participating VAMC ’s primary
care/PACT programs, whether sited in a women ’sc l i n i c
or general primary care clinic, will also be examined.
Ethical approval and informed consent
The VA supports a large number of Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs) across the USA among chiefly academically
affiliated VAMCs, in addition to a Central IRB (cIRB)
for multisite research. While this study represents a
12-VAMC cluster randomized trial, the cIRB determined
that participating sites were not engaged in research
(i.e., the intervention is QI, and all research activities
are performed centrally at th eP r i n c i p a lI n v e s t i g a t o r ’ss i t ei n
the VA Greater Los Angeles (G LA) Healthcare System),
permitting the use of the local GLA IRB. Evaluation and
data collection activities are submitted serially to the GLA
IRB for review as discrete human subject research compo-
nent projects (e.g., patient sur vey component, provider/staff
survey component). Two components involved contrac-
tors at local affiliates (teamlet interviews with UCLA,
provider/staff survey with RAND Health), whose IRBs
also reviewed and approved their respective activities.
The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT02039856).
VA partnerships
This study is one of the five inter-related projects that
together comprise a WH-focused research-clinical part-
nership funded by VA Health Services Research and
Development (HSR&D) Service under the Collaborative
Research to Enhance and Advance Transformation and
Excellence (CREATE) initiative [18]. Central to CREATE
is the involvement of policy and/or practice partners in
the design, conduct, and dissemination of study results,
with an emphasis on implementation and spread of suc-
cessful strategies. Within the VA Office of Patient CareYano et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:101 Page 3 of 14

Services, Women ’s Health Services (WHS) is the WH
CREATE ’s primary partner, with close involvement of
Mental Health Services (MHS) in assessing within- and
across-project mental health analyses and themes. The
WH CREATE is also advised by an Executive Steering
Committee, comprised of WHS and MHS partners, repre-
sentatives in national VA clinical quality reporting, re-
gional network leadership, public affairs, WH clinical care
delivery, WH policy, and implementation science and eco-
nomics, as well as WVs who use the VA for care.
Conceptual framework for application of EBQI
This study is guided conceptually and practically by the
Chronic Care Model (CCM) [19]. Developed more than
a decade ago, the CCM has been widely adopted to help
guide clinical QI initiatives in the context of practices or
teams in the USA and abroad [20]. The CCM depicts
the health system linked with complementary commu-
nity resources, while providers and teams within each
healthcare organization (regardless of size) aim to deliver
care that is characterized by consistent, evidence-based
assessment, treatment, and follow-up, with clinical deci-
sion support (often via information technology) and sup-
port for patient self-management [21]. Applied to EBQI,
local QI teams work on improvement plans that con-
sider one or more CCM elements.
The CCM is a particularly strong fit for QI around
medical homes, with an easy crosswalk to PACT goals.
For example, for care coordination, PACT teamlets
should link patients with community resources to facili-
tate referrals and respond to social service needs; pro-
vide care management services for high-risk patients;
integrate behavioral health and specialty care through
structured collaboration, co-location, or referral protocols;
track and support patients when they obtain services
outside the practice; follow up with patients within a
few days of an emergency room visit or hospital dis-
charge; and communicate test results and care plans to
patients/families [22].
Addressing CCM elements, however, requires substan-
tial stakeholder buy-in, local knowledge and skills in QI,
availability of needed technical support, and continual
guidance. Previous research has shown that evidence-
based programs require adaptation to organizational
values, needs, and resources prior to dissemination [23].
More structured than continuous quality improvement
(CQI), which has had mixed results, EBQI is a system-
atic approach to developing a multilevel research-clinical
partnership approach to QI, using top-down/bottom-up
features to engage senior organizational leaders and local
QI teams in implementing improvements in the context
of prior evidence, provider behavior change methods,
and local practice structure and resources [24]. National
strategic directives serve as guides, while regional expertpanels set innovation design priorities [25]. Local inter-
disciplinary QI teams design and implement local activ-
ities, while researchers serve as technical experts and
guides. EBQI also uses team-based CQI methods to help
teams structure their aims and measures and conduct
plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, in addition to convening
topic-focused workgroups with research/clinical expertise
with periodic across-site meetings for training and sharing
data and lessons learned. EBQI ’s value-added contribution
is an emphasis on (a) applying objective evidence, with (b)
theory review and synthesis integrated into aspects of
innovation design and implementation, (c) valid and reli-
able measurement, and (d) formal measurement feedback
to stakeholders at all levels [26]. Effectively applied to a
series of VA implementation studies [27 –29], EBQI uses
well-established implementation strategies, such as local
priority setting among key stakeholders, adaptation of the
evidence to local context (practice tailoring), audit-and-
feedback of QI data to support rapid cycle improvements,
and practice facilitation to support implementation into
practice [30].
EBQI implementation strategies applied to WH-PACT and
hypotheses
In this study, we propose to use EBQI to convene multi-
level stakeholder panels (presenting panels with evidence
on factors associated with improved WH care in the con-
text of national VA WH policy); facilitate local practice
QI team design meetings, while providing QI training/
education and iterative QI data feedback; and sponsor
within and across-practice QI collaboration calls (Fig. 2).
We will continually foster coverage of CCM elements.
We hypothesize that the initial results of EBQI will be
the specification of the design choices for WH-PACT
implementation, conduct of local QI activities, and im-
proved provider/staff (and team) QI orientation, WH
knowledge and attitudes, and gender awareness. We further
hypothesize that EBQI will lead to higher achievement of
WH-PACT (more practices achieve more features) in EBQI
vs. control practices (aim #1). We anticipate that practice
context (e.g., local leadersh ip support, pre-EBQI factors)
will moderate the relationships between EBQI and imple-
mentation of WH-PACT. We will then explore the extent
to which receipt of WH-PACT concordant care (PACT
features, comprehensive WH care, gender sensitive care
delivery) is associated with improved WH-PACT out-
comes (aim #2).
For aim #3 (processes), we will document EBQI activ-
ities among intervention practices and examine barriers
and facilitators to WH-PACT achievement in all partici-
pating practices. For aim #3, we will also rely on Diffusion
of Innovation theory [31, 32] to frame our assessment
of EBQI-supported WH-PACT adaptation, implementa-
tion, and sustainability, considering, for example, theYano et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:101 Page 5 of 14
trialability, complexity, and relative advantage of EBQI-
supported WH-PACT, as well as concordance between
WH-PACT achievement and CCM principles. Aim #4
(tools) will build on our conceptual model and benefit
from our practical experience implementing evidence-
based care models [15].
In this study, EBQI implementation will focus on six
main activities: (1) conduct of four VISN-level interdis-
ciplinary stakeholder planning meetings using expert panel
techniques to come to consensus on PACT QI priorities
for women Veterans ( “QI roadmaps ”); (2) development
and training of a local QI champion and QI team members
at EBQI-assigned VAMCs to pursue one or more QI
projects from the “roadmaps ”; (3) formative feedback
from patient, provider, staff, and practice survey data; key
stakeholder and teamlet interview data; and utilization
and cost-related administrative data; (4) ongoing practice
facilitation and expert review and feedback on local QI
proposals and progress; (5) monthly across-intervention
VAMC calls to facilitate collaboration and spread of ef-
fective QI innovations; and (6) technical work groups
designed to provide additional evidence-based support
in priority areas (Table 1).
Evaluation
As shown in Fig. 3, we have planned a comprehensive
approach to evaluating the processes and outcomes of
EBQI for tailoring PACT to the needs of WVs. Baseline
data collection (as well as 12-month follow-up in the
case of the patient surveys) will be used for formative
feedback to EBQI-assigned VAMCs. Table 2 provides anoverview of the data sources, samples, and measures
planned for each evaluation component.
Sample size calculation and power analysis
We based our power calculations on the study ’s unequal
(2:1) intervention-to-control ratio and clustered sample
design. To detect a moderate (0.20) effect size between
WVs at intervention and control sites, we considered
data from the Primary Care Satisfaction Survey for
Women ’s Care Coordination and Comprehensiveness scale,
[33] with 12 practices (8 intervention-to-4 control sites),
cluster adjustment (ICC = 0.03) [34], and two-tailed 5 % sig-
nificance level. Based on these parameters, we will target
enrollment of a minimum of 40 WVs at each of the 12
study sites over the 2-year period (baseline to 24-month
follow-up), for a total of 480 WVs who complete a baseline
and at least one of the two fo llow-up surveys (12- and/or
24-month). To achieve this target, we will create a baseline
sample of 6665 WVs who have received PC or WH care at
one of the study ’s1 2p a r t i c i p a t i n gs i t e sd u r i n gt h e
12-month period prior to the baseline survey (555 per
site). Allowing for a conservative 20 % response rate and
40 % attrition over the 2-year period, we aim to enroll 111
WVs at each of the 12 sites at baseline, for a total of 1333
interviews at the completion of the first wave.
Primary outcome measures
The primary outcome measure, focused on achievement
of the PACT model of care for WVs, will include
changes in levels of achievement of individual PACT fea-
tures: access, continuity, care coordination, team-based

care, patient-driven care, patient-centeredness, compre-
hensiveness (including gender-specific services and in-
tegrated MH), and gender sensitivity (Fig. 2). These
measures will be examined at the practice, provider/
staff, and patient levels and investigated qualitatively
using the key stakeholder and teamlet interviews.
Secondary outcome measures
Secondary outcome measures include WH-PACT out-
comes that should result from achievement of the full
PACT model, including improvements in quality of care
and health status, and reductions in utilization and costs.
For quality of care, we will examine chronic disease qual-
ity (e.g., process measures such as foot sensation exams or
eye exams among diabetics) and preventive practice (e.g.,
women ’s breast and cervical cancer screening and gender-
neutral prevention, such as influenza immunizations and
colorectal cancer screening). We will determine whether
total annual costs per patient and utilization by type of
care (e.g., primary care, specialty care, hospitalizations,
emergency department visit rates) have changed in EBQI
vs. routine PACT implementation VAMCs and based on
level of WH-PACT achievement. We anticipate, however,
that acute and emergency care may be too rare in our
practice populations to have the power to detect differ-
ences over time, so these analyses will be exploratory.
We will also examine impacts on provider and staff WH
knowledge and attitudes, QI orientation/culture, and
gender awareness, as well as changes in practice context-
ual factors as a result of EBQI exposure (e.g., changes in
leadership support, local resources applied to WH and
primary care QI, training).
Statistical analyses
We will use multivariate regression to determine EBQI
effectiveness, adjusting for covariates, clustering, andenrollment and attrition weights at the patient and
provider/staff levels. The primary regressor of interest
is being at an EBQI vs. routine PACT implementation site.
We will examine the potential moderating effects of
practice context and provider/staff knowledge/attitudes.
Patient-level controls will include sociodemographic
characteristics, health status, comorbidity, and utilization.
Adjustment for clustering will be performed using Stata
v13. We will evaluate goodness-of-fit using Mallow ’s
statistic (C p). We will use multiple imputation methods
to address missing data patterns among covariates, al-
though CATI procedures will significantly reduce item
non-response in the patient survey, and the web-survey
methods will do the same for the provider/staff surveys.
Hot deck imputation will be used for imputation of
missing values within scales as needed. To address the
potential for response bias, patient and provider/staff
survey data will be weighted to the inverse of the prob-
ability of selection based on available characteristics in
the administrative data used to randomly sample them.
We will use factor analysis and cluster analysis using
PACT features (e.g., access), comprehensive women ’s health
care (e.g., gender-specific care availability), and gender-
sensitive care delivery (e.g., availability of same-gender
providers or gender-aware providers) for WH-PACT
achievement variable creation.
All semi-structured interviews will be audio-recorded
and transcribed, and qualitative analysis will be conducted
using ATLAS.ti version 7. Interview domains are noted in
Table 2. Initially, a top-level codebook will be developed
for the baseline interviews based on the interview guide.
The codebook will then be elaborated based on emergent
themes using a constant comparison analytic approach,
adjusting as each round of interviews is reviewed. Inter-
views will be compared within and across facilities and
over time. In baseline key stakeholder and teamlet

transcripts, we will conduct targeted coding of PACT-re-
lated knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and experiences; ex-
pectations of WH-PACT ’s effectiveness; and practice
contextual factors that influence how care is delivered
(and changed) locally. In follow-up key stakeholder tran-
scripts, we will identify factors that facilitated and/or im-
peded EBQI and WH-PACT achievement and strengths/
weaknesses of the WH-PACT model as implemented.
Trial timeframe
The WH-PACT trial is planned from March 2013
through February 2017 (Fig. 1). Phase 1 network-level
stakeholder panel meetings occurred as half-day in-person
meetings from May to August 2014. Phase 2 local QI
launched at all eight EBQI-assigned VAMCs in October
2014. Baseline key stakeholder interviews in all participat-
ing VISN and VAMC followed within days of each re-
spective network-level meeting, followed by teamlet
interviews at EBQI sites only within one quarter of each
meeting. Provider and staff surveys were fielded to PC and
WH providers and staff in all participating VAMCs start-
ing September 2014, while baseline patient surveys were
launched in January 2015, yielding formative feedback in
the following year. EBQI will run for 24 months from
launch of local QI teams, followed by 24-month follow-up
interview and survey waves.

Baseline data collection and EBQI implementation phase.
Discussion
This trial represents an important opportunity to tailor
VA’s PCMH to the needs of WVs while also providing
new implementation science insights. This study is one
of the first of its kind to test EBQI in the context of the
VA WH-PBRN, building on lessons learned from a pilot
EBQI study in the founder sites conducted in the first
few years of PBRN implementation [35]. The value-
added of PBRN use for sustainable practice-based changes
in VA settings adds another dimension to this work. We
anticipate that we will glean important new knowledge of
what is needed to accomplish multilevel stakeholder en-
gagement in evidence-based organizational changes.
The VA has undergone significant changes in the past
30 years since the Government Accounting Office first
identified deficits in care for women in 1982 [1]. There
is a growing awareness of the vulnerability of women in
the military, [36, 37] with substantial MH burdens, [38]
and increasing demands in an array of new mandated
WH services (such as maternity benefits and newborn
care), all occurring in a healthcare system with a charac-
teristically low volume of women. While VA managers
have economic incentives to increase market share among
women, an underlying tension remains unresolved onhow best to achieve the tenets of gender-sensitive compre-
hensive WH care [39, 40].
We anticipate that study results will demonstrate the
value of EBQI approaches to adapting PACT to the needs
of special populations, ensuring PACT not only meets the
needs of WVs but also serves as an exemplar for other
special populations (e.g., recently returned veterans who
may need specific post-deployment health care, veterans
with HIV who sometimes obtain PC in infectious disease
clinics). Given the growing number of WVs relying on VA
care, the expansion of services for which WVs are now
eligible [41], and the pressing need to reduce persistent
gender disparities in VA care, the VA will reap important
benefits from determining how to adapt PACT to enhance
WVs ’outcomes. And, by systematically engaging frontline
leaders, managers, and providers, our approach will sub-
stantially increase the relevance and thereby potential sus-
tainability and spread of the resulting WH-PACT model.
In this study, we will develop and test methods for
providing the kind of organizational supports that the
Institute of Medicine ’sCrossing the Quality Chasm re-
ferred to as central to transformative change [42]. This
study reflects the first time these methods will be deployed
to address the needs of WVs, tied to careful, compre-
hensive measurement and evaluation, which in turn will
inform an evidence-based roadmap for policy/practice
action and a foundation for developing evidence-based
tools to support scale-up and spread to different VA
types in different contexts. The strength of our partner-
ships with WH and primary care leadership will also
ensure that we are continually grounded in fiscal, man-
agement, and strategic issues of consequence as the
study is conducted. Tackling the fundamental tenets of
PACT care in gender-sensitive and patient-centered ways
will clearly be essential to retaining WVs in care and ful-
filling the promise to ensure that WVs get “the best care
anywhere ”[43].

Funding
This study was funded by the VA HSR&D Service, Office of Research &
Development, Washington DC (Project # CRE12-026), and enabled further by
conduct within the Women ’s Health Practice-Based Research Network
funded by VA HSR&D Service (Project # SDR 10 –012). Development and
implementation of the EBQI intervention is being supported through
annual Memoranda of Understanding with funding from VA Women ’s
Health Services (WHS) in the Office of Patient Care Services, Veterans
Health Administration. Dr. Yano ’s effort was covered by a VA HSR&D Senior
Research Career Scientist award (RCS #05-195).
Funders from VA HSR&D Service have not had direct roles in this trial. They
request regular reporting of progress, notification of accepted manuscripts or
scientific abstracts, and other routine grant administration requirements. VA
WHS support of EBQI implementation has resulted in similar reporting
mechanisms (quarterly to annual summaries of progress and activities). The
partnered roles of WHS, other VA leaders, and non-VA experts on the WH
CREATE Executive Steering Committee (ESC) have constituted implementation-
focused dialog on actions that might be organized or taken in response to early
project findings.
Availability of data and materials
Consents associated with primary data collection for patient and clinician/staff
surveys used to evaluate this implementa tion strategy did not include permission
to share data in publicly available repositories. Re-identification is a particular
concern in the key stakeholder and teamlet interviews because of the
specific nature of the roles included in a select number of VA networks
and VA medical centers, precluding data sharing outside the VA. De-identified
administrative datasets may be eligible for future data sharing once national VA
guidance on request and distribution processes are provided (in process).
Final datasets will be maintained local ly until enterprise-level resources
become available for long-term storage and access. The analytical datasets and
statistical code used in subsequent publications will be retained for a minimum
of 6 years, in accordance with VA recor d retention policy. Any future public
release data datasets determined to m eet VA guidelines will be maintained
so that a VA-approved auditor or the PI could conduct or facilitate validation if
needed.
Authors ’contributions
EMY (principal investigator) and LVR (co-principal investigator) conceived the
study and acquired the funding. EMY wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
ABH, EC, LSM, JD, and IC revised and augmented the methodological detail
of their respective sections of the study methods. EMY, AH and JD reviewed
and refined the draft. All coauthors have been involved in the iterative review,

Authors ’information
The work represented by this study protocol benefitted from the prior work
evaluating the effectiveness and impact of EBQI strategies in the VISN 22 PACT
Demonstration Laboratory (also called the Veterans Assessment and
Improvement Laboratory or VAIL), part of a five-Lab consortium funded by the
VA Office of Patient Care Services to develop and test PACT innovations in five
regions of the US. LVR and EMY were the PI and Co-PI of VAIL, respectively,
while AH, LSM, and JD were the integral VAIL investigators and staff. EMY is a
health care epidemiologist with nationally recognized implementation
evaluation expertise. AH is a medical anthropologist with similarly nationally
recognized implementation evaluation expertise with a focus on qualitative
inquiry. IC is a public administration trained project director with nearly two
decades of experience managing women Veterans ’research. EC is a health care
organizational researcher with expertise in studying health care teams. LSM is a
social psychologist and leading scholar in studying provider attitudes and
behavior, who also led the VAIL provider/staff surveys. JD is a survey specialist,
who served as a VAIL survey director and led to the VAIL analyses of national
VA patient survey data, and led to the comparable efforts in the current protocol.
LVR is an internationally known implementation scientist, with emphasis
on primary care-based organizational improvement, and is a general internist
who also practices in PACT.Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
This study protocol has been approved by the VA Greater Los Angeles
Healthcare System IRB-B Subcommittee (IRB Chair, Paul Shekelle, MD, PhD)
(Approval Number 2013-040589). Individual study components (e.g., qualitative
methods (key stakeholder and teamlet interviews), patient survey, provider/staff
survey) were reviewed and approved by the IRB-B as serial project modifications
to an umbrella IRB application under the study title. For each study component,
we obtained IRB approval for waivers of documentation of consent for all
data collections. Consent was provided verbally and recorded in the case
of interviews, verbally provided and recorded in the data by an interviewer
for the patient surveys, and indicated by answering survey questions in the
self-administered web-based provid er/staff surveys. For retrospective
administrative data pulls and analysis, we obtained a human subjects
research exemption.
The VA Central IRB (Washington DC) also determined that the participating
VA medical centers ( n= 12) were not engaged in research and that the
intervention (or implementation strategy, evidence-based quality improvement
(EBQI)) was QI. Documentation of IRB approval (and in VA settings, Research &
Development Committee approval as well) and Central IRB determination of
non-research for the implementation strategy are available on request. Two of
the study components involved contractors at local affiliates (teamlet interviews
with UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and provider/staff surveys with
RAND Health), whose IRBs also reviewed and approved their respective activities
in addition to the VA IRB.
No animals are or will be involved in this study protocol. Similarly, the use of
animal or human data or tissue is not applicable to this study protocol.
No individual person ’s data in any form are or will be included in this or
subsequent manuscripts. Only aggregated patient, clinician, and staff survey
data will be reported. For key stakeholder and/or teamlet interview data,
non-attributed or identifiable quotes may be reported in addition to thematic
summaries.
