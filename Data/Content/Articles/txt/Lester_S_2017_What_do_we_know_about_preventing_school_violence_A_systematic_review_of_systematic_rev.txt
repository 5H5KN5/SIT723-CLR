ABSTRACT
Many children across the world are exposed to school violence, 
which undermines their right to education and adversely affects their 
development. Studies of interventions for school violence suggest 
that it can be prevented. However, this evidence base is challenging to navigate. We completed a systematic review of interventions to reduce four types of school violence: (a) peer violence; (b) corporal punishment; (c) student-on-teacher violence and (d) teacher-on-
student violence. Reviewers independently searched databases 
and journals. Included studies were published between 2005 and 2015; in English; considered school-based interventions for children and measured violence as an outcome. Many systematic reviews were found, thus we completed a systematic review of systematic 
reviews. Only systematic reviews on interventions for intimate partner 
violence (IPV) and peer aggression were found. These reviews were 
generally of moderate quality. Research on both types of violence was 
largely completed in North America. Only a handful of programmes demonstrate promise in preventing IPV. Cognitive behavioral, social-emotional and peer mentoring/mediation programmes showed promise in reducing the levels of perpetration of peer aggression. Further research needs to determine the long-term effects of 
interventions, potential moderators and mediators of program 
effects, program effects across different contexts and key intervention 
components.
Introduction
School violence undermines children’s right to education and adversely affects their devel-
opment. The long term consequences are also costly for broader society (Burton & Leoschut, 
2013). Worryingly, children across the world report exposure to violence at school (Due, 
Holstein, & Soc, 2008).
Although bullying is a major focus of school violence research, violence in schools encom -
passes much more. Bullying is defined as repeated aggressive episodes where there is a power KEYWORDS

imbalance between the bully and his/her victim (Menesini & Salmivalli, in press). Bullying 
is thus a subset of peer violence, a broader group of behaviors that include ‘the intentional 
use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, …. that either results in or has a high 
likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or depriva-
tion’ (Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, & Lozano, 2002, p. 4). School violence thus includes 
any violence between students, corporal punishment of students by teachers (Burton & 
Leoschut, 2013), other forms of violence directed at students by teachers such as verbal 
aggression or rape (Lee, 2015), and violence directed by students at teachers (Dzuka & 
Dalbert, 2007; Wilson, Douglas, & Lyon, 2011). Furthermore, school violence is specifically 
defined as violence occurring on school premises, while traveling to or from school, or 
during a school-sponsored event (http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/youthviolence/
schoolviolence/).
A number of interventions have been tested for their potential to prevent school violence. 
These may be universal  (all students participate; Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). Others may 
target students at increased risk for violence or those already demonstrating violent behav-iors, known respectively as selected  and indicated  interventions (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). 
Additionally, interventions using a whole -school  approach intervene at multiple levels within 
a school (Gevers & Flisher, 2012), whereas discrete  interventions work only with a particular 
aspect of the school, for example just the students (Gevers & Flisher, 2012). Comprehensive  
programmes address a range of risk behaviors, whereas specific  programmes address a par -
ticular problem (Gevers & Flisher, 2012). Such complexity can make it challenging to deter -
mine exactly which interventions are the most effective for different types of school violence.
A number of reviews of school violence interventions have synthesized the literature 
and so addressed a variety of these issues; thus, following Mikton and Butchart’s (2009) 
approach to understanding interventions to prevent child maltreatment, we aimed to com -
plete a systematic review of systematic reviews that addressed the question: What do we 
know about preventing school violence?
Methods
Search strategy
Pairs of research assistants each independently searched 49 electronic databases, 3 clinical 
trial registries and 10 online journals for articles on school violence (see Appendix A ). 
Searches were limited to papers in English and in publication years 2005–2015, except for 
those addressing corporal punishment. Two searches of abstracts were conducted. The 
first used search terms: school AND (violen* OR aggress* OR bully* OR bulli*), while the 
second used the search terms school  AND ‘corporal punishment’ . Literature on corporal 
punishment was sought from 1980 to 2015, because of the small body of work completed on this type of violence in schools (there is a large body of work on parental corporal 
punishment; Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016). Experts in the field who were part of the 
kNOw Violence in Childhood Project School’s Learning Group were also consulted about 
relevant studies.
Studies were considered relevant if they:
(1)    Were in English;
PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE    189
(2)    Included change in violent behavior or one of its synonyms (such as aggression, 
externalizing behavior/problems, conduct behavior/problems or intimate partner 
violence [IPV]) as an outcome;
(3)    Addressed an intervention for violent behavior that was implemented at, or 
recruited participants from, school; and
(4)    Included pre-primary, primary or secondary school students.
We focused on change in behavior because changes in knowledge and attitudes alone are not 
sufficient to change behavior (De La Rue, Polanin, Espelage, & Pigott, 2014; Whitaker, Murphy, 
Eckhardt, Hodges, & Cowart, 2013). In addition, articles with (a) suicide, (b) school shootings 
and (c) teacher-on-teacher violence as an outcome were excluded. Information and communi -
cation technology interventions (which relate more to cyberbullying), psychopharmacological 
interventions, and interventions which extended across multiple domains like multisystemic 
therapy (Henggeler, Melton, Brondino, Scherer, & Hanley, 1997), were also excluded.
The initial search identified a large number of relevant systematic reviews, and we there -
fore decided to do a systematic review of systematic reviews, rather than a systematic review of 
primary studies (Mikton & Butchart, 2009). Research assistants then screened the full text of 
reviews to determine whether they met an additional inclusion criterion: the review included 
at least three primary studies about interventions which were implemented at school or recruited participants from school (see Appendix B and C respectively, for included and 
excluded reviews).
Data extraction
The quality of the relevant reviews was assessed, and descriptive information captured (see 
Appendix D for extraction document).
We used the AMSTAR tool to assess methodological quality of each review (Shea et al., 
2009). AMSTAR scores between 0 and 4 indicate that a review is of poor quality, scores 
between 5 and 8 indicate moderate quality, and scores of 9–11 indicate high quality (Mikton 
& Butchart, 2009). A second reviewer checked 42% of the AMSTAR scores. An intra-class correlation coefficient of above .80 was achieved, indicating a good level of coding consist-
ency (Aspland & Gardner, 2003).
Results
Our initial screening identified over 400 systematic reviews. A second round of screening 
found 36 that were eligible for inclusion (see Figure 1). These only addressed interventions 
for IPV and peer aggression.
A small number of narrative reviews and primary studies (which were excluded) were 
identified on student-on-teacher violence, teacher-on-student violence and corporal pun-ishment in schools.
IPV
Five reviews of interventions for IPV were identified. On average, these were of moderate 
quality (see Table 1).

Descriptions of programmes to prevent IPV
Since a number of school-based IPV prevention programmes have been studied using 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) – the strongest evaluation design – we report only on 
these 11 programmes (see Table 2).
All programmes were universal and largely specific to IPV , and barring two (the building-
based version of Shifting Boundaries, which targeted the whole school; Taylor, Stein, Mumford, & Woods, 2013; and the Safe Dates poster and theatre elements; Foshee et al., 
2005) were discrete. Interventions were aimed at high school students of both genders, 
with the lone exception of Coaching Boys into Men, which focused only on boys (Miller 
et al., 2013).
All but one of the primary studies included in the reviews were completed on the North 
American continent (10 studies), and largely in the USA. One study by Jewkes et al. (2008) 
was conducted in the African region (South Africa), and none in any other region. Y et rates 
of IPV are highest in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia, followed by 
the Americas (Stöckl, Devries, & Watts, 2015). Most programmes have thus been tested in 
contexts that need them least.Records identified through database

Evidence for programmes to prevent IPV
Safe Dates (Foshee et al., 2005), the Fourth R (Wolfe et al., 2009), Stepping Stones (Jewkes 
et al., 2008) and the building-level version of Shifting Boundaries (Taylor et al., 2013) 
stand out as the only programmes that achieved positive effects (see Table 3). Teachers, 
project staff and health educators implemented these programmes. The duration of the 
latter three programmes seemed to average around 7 weeks. However, number of sessions 
ranged from 10 to 21. Safe Dates (Foshee et al., 2005), the Fourth R (Wolfe et al., 2009) and 
Stepping Stones (Jewkes et al., 2008) are also conspicuous as having been studied in trials 
with the strongest methods for determining evidence of effect in that they have the longest 
follow-up periods (3, 2.5 and 2 years, respectively). The Safe Dates trial was also strong in 
that it measured the widest range of forms of dating violence, and was able to show that 
effects for several forms of violence persisted over time (Foshee et al., 1998, 2004, 2005, 
2000, 1996). Two programmes – the Law and Justice Curriculum (Taylor, Stein, & Burden, 
2010a) and Interaction-Based Treatment (Taylor et al., 2010a) – were identified as possibly 
doing harm, in that they led to increased reporting of perpetration.
No program had been studied in more than one RCT, and so the evidence for any pro-
gram can at best only be considered promising by two of the current standards for preven-
tion science: Blueprints for Healthy Y outh Development (http://www.blueprintsprograms.
com ), and those of the Society for Prevention Research (Gottfredson et al., 2015). Many 
of the trials reviewed also had some risk of bias (De Koker, Mathews, Zuch, Bastien, & Mason-Jones, 2014; Whitaker et al., 2006).
Moderation effects are also key in understanding programmes (Gottfredson et al., 2015): 
Safe Dates has produced evidence that there is no difference in effectiveness by gender, by 
white vs. other ethnicity, or by whether students had previous experience of dating violence; 
but the trial of the Fourth R showed that the effect was present only for boys (Whitaker  
et al., 2013).
Safe Dates thus appears to be the most effective school-based program for preventing 
dating violence, but the evidence base in general needs much more development.
Peer aggression
We identified a total of 31 reviews addressing effectiveness of interventions to prevent 
peer aggression. AMSTAR scores (see Table 4) had a mean of 6, indicating that on average 
the reviews were of moderate quality. Nearly 40% (387) of the primary studies on school-
based interventions evaluated the interventions in RCTs, and 213 (22%) utilized quasi-
experimental designs. However, many reviews did not provide information on study design.
Descriptions of programmes to prevent peer aggression
Universal interventions were much more commonly included in the reviews than selected 
and indicated interventions, as were discrete rather than multi-level or whole-school inter -
ventions (see Table 5). There were also more specific than comprehensive programmes. Nearly half of all the interventions targeted children of primary school age. Interventions 
were also generally delivered to both genders.
Most of the interventions were studied in North America, specifically within the USA 
(see Table 6 and Figure 2). This is exceptionally problematic as countries outside the USA

show comparable, if not higher; levels of peer aggression (for instance, see; Chen & Avi 
Astor, 2010).
Evidence for programmes to prevent peer aggression
We analyzed effectiveness in reducing peer victimization (see Table 7) and perpetration 
of peer aggression (see Table 8) separately. Less than half the studies used RCTs to exam-
ine program effects, thus some caution is required when interpreting findings relating to 
effectiveness of interventions.
Prevention of victimization. Only eight reviews considered program effectiveness for 
reducing peer victimisation . The specific type of victimization explored in evaluations was 
not often specified, but when it was, the focus was on physical and relational victimization. 
The vast majority of programmes were universal in terms of target, and the majority of 
these scored poorly in terms of effectiveness. The single selective intervention was found 
to be ineffective. Most were discrete interventions and of these, only cognitive behavioral 
programmes showed promise for preventing victimization. Violence prevention programmes 
showed some promise in preventing victimization only when implemented as a whole-
school intervention. No harmful effects were noted in this area overall. These findings 
tentatively suggest that discrete, cognitive-behavioral programmes that specifically target 
the prevention of victimisation show promise, and that consideration should be given to 
ways they can be included in whole-school interventions.
Programmes to prevent perpetration. All 31 reviews considered the capacity of school-
based interventions to reduce perpetration  of peer aggression. Intervention effects on the 
perpetration of aggression or violence (verbal or physical) in particular were considered in a% = number of studies on school-based interventions with effects for peer aggression with characteristic/total number of 
studies on school-based interventions with effects for peer aggression.

eeffectiveness rating based on rubric. We rated the effectiveness of interventions reviewed according to the following rubric: (1) Found overall to be effective (i.e. peer aggression reduced in 100% of 
the effects, or as reported by a meta-analysis); (2) Found to be mostly effective (i.e. peer aggression reduced in 75% or more of the reviewed studies’ effects as a result of the intervention); (3) Found 
to be slightly effective (i.e. peer aggression reduced in 56–74% of the reviewed studies’ effects as a result of the intervention); (4) o verall mixed effects (i.e. peer aggression reduced in 45–55% 
of the reviewed studies’ effects as a result of the intervention); (5) a minority of studies found an effect (i.e. peer aggression reduced in 26–44% of the reviewed studies’ effects as a result of the intervention); (6) Found to be mostly ineffective (i.e. peer aggression reduced in 25% or less of the reviewed studies’ effects as a result of the intervention); (7) Found overall to be ineffective (i.e. no effects/change on peer aggression overall, or as reported by a meta-analysis).

interventions. The majority of these were scored as effective, with 58% of the unspecified 
interventions scoring a 1 and 89% of the indicated interventions scoring 1. There is some 
evidence that the effects of universal interventions endure beyond the immediate post-test. 
For selected and indicated interventions, these effects were largely only found at post-test. 
Interventions which did not specify their prevention target demonstrated more mixed effects 
for reducing peer aggression immediately after program completion; however longer-term follow-up effects were largely positive.
With regards to intervention approaches, discrete programmes had the most evidence for 
effectiveness, followed by multi-level and whole-school programmes – although it should be noted that approach was specified in less than half of the reviews. Socio-emotional pro-
grammes have been found to be one of the most promising approaches, while cognitive 
behavioral and peer mentoring/mediation interventions have also fairly consistently demon -
strated positive results. There was a broad range in the duration of these programmes. Socio-
emotional programmes generally seemed to offer around 16 sessions. Unfortunately, session 
number information was often not specified. Program sessions were also implemented at a 
varying rate; once or twice a week seemed fairly common. Various school (mostly teachers) 
and research personnel were often involved in their implementation as well. Other types of 
intervention were effective in some studies but ineffective or harmful in others. Very few 
studies considered the effectiveness of whole-school programmes, suggesting the need for 
further research on these types of interventions. Promisingly, across all reviews, harmful 
effects (i.e. increased reports of perpetration) were reported in very few studies.
Only a handful of the reviews considered moderators of program effects. Well imple-
mented cognitive behavioral interventions and those with more sessions each week were 
found to be beneficial (Wilson & Lipsey, 2006b). Considering socio-emotional and cognitive 
behavioral programmes together there was mixed evidence for short program duration 
to be associated with positive effects (Gansle, 2005; Sklad, Diekstra, De Ritter, Ben, & 
Gravesteijn, 2012), however a trend towards younger students benefiting more from these 
types of interventions was found in two reviews (Sklad et al., 2012; Stoltz, van Londen, 
Dekovic, de Castro, & Prinzie, 2012).
Discussion
There is very little literature on prevention of teacher-on-student violence (including corpo -
ral punishment) and student-on-teacher violence, even though these forms of violence seem 
quite common (see, for instance; Burton & Leoschut, 2013; Chen & Wei, 2011; Lee, 2015). 
More promisingly, there is a great deal of literature addressing prevention of IPV and even 
more dealing with peer aggression at school, although there are substantial gaps even here.
One key gap in the field is that studies often only measure one outcome, even where 
a program is theoretically likely to reduce more than one form of violence. For instance, 
peer aggression and dating violence share common risk factors (Smallbone & McKillop, 
2015), and reductions in dating violence are thus highly likely to follow from interven-
tions to reduce peer violence. Similarly, victimisation is seldom measured as an outcome. 
Importantly, the field of violence prevention will only be advanced if specific effects on 
aggressive behavior are reported separately from other forms of externalizing behaviors.
More high quality studies are also needed: RCTs with longer follow-up periods, lower risk 
of bias, and which explore mediation and moderation effects, will allow us to understand 
PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE    207
which programmes have sustained effects, what theoretical perspectives drive effective 
programmes (and so to understand not only what programmes work, but also why they 
work), and which programmes are generalizable to which groups (Gottfredson et al., 2015; 
Whitaker et al., 2006, 2013).
Another bias in the literature is that research on the effectiveness of interventions was 
almost exclusively completed in wealthier regions, particularly in the USA. This is exception -
ally problematic, as school violence is a global problem (see, for instance; Burton & Leoschut, 
2013; Chen & Avi Astor, 2010; Due et al., 2008; Fernandez-Fuertes & Fuertes, 2010; Wubs et al., 2009). More studies in high-violence, low-resource contexts are urgently needed.
Some interventions were identified as harmful, in that they led to increasing reports 
of aggression. This may be because programmes increased awareness and thus increased 
reporting (Taylor et al., 2010a; Taylor, Stein, & Burden, 2010b), but it may also have been because of adverse reactions to the intervention (DeGue et al., 2014). It may also be an 
artefact of study design: studies with short follow-up periods will be unable to differentiate 
an increase in response to heightened awareness from those that actually cause increased 
aggression, as it takes time for reporting to stabilize in response to awareness and then to 
decline in response to an effective program.
Another important focus for new studies should be components of effective interven-
tions (Whitaker et al., 2013). This could be done either through developing and testing new 
programmes that build on what has been learned about effective interventions (Whitaker 
et al., 2006), or through meta-analytic studies of successful programmes (see, for instance; 
Kaminski, Valle, Filene, and Boyle, 2008). Studies of this nature assist in identifying the 
‘active ingredients’ in programmes (Embry & Biglan, 2008).
This review does have some limitations. Firstly, we included only systematic reviews, 
and the information we were able to extract from each review was dependent on what was 
reported. This strategy means that promising interventions that had not yet been included 
in a review would have been missed. Secondly, we were unable to determine the extent of 
primary study duplication across the reviews on peer aggression. Therefore, the true size 
of the evidence base on school-based violence prevention interventions remains somewhat 
unclear. Thirdly, we only included studies published in English. Thus, our results do not 
reflect the findings of any possible reviews on school violence interventions published in 
other languages.
Despite these limitations, it is clear that a number of violence prevention initiatives 
have been successfully delivered at school. Several promising interventions to prevent IPV 
could be identified. Cognitive behavioral, social-emotional and peer mentoring/mediation 
programmes were effective for preventing perpetration of peer violence, and cognitive 
behavioral and whole-school violence prevention programmes show promise for preventing 
peer victimisation. While the field needs considerable development in order to be regarded 
as having a strong evidence base, the existing literature does provide us with a good foun-
dation for tackling this serious problem.

Part B: AMSTAR
Yes No Can’t answer Comments
1. Question: Was an ‘a priori’ design provided?
explanation: the research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review
note: need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a ‘yes’
2. Question: Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
explanation: there should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in 
place
note: two people do study selection, two people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s 
work
3. Question: Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
explanation: at least two electronic sources should be searched. the report must include years and databases used (e.g. c entral, 
eMBase, and Medline). Key words and/or Mesh terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should 
be provided. all searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found
note: if at least two sources + one supplementary strategy used, select ‘yes’ ( cochrane register/central counts as two sources; 
a grey literature search counts as supplementary)
4. Question: Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
explanation: the authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. the authors should state 
whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc.
note: if review indicates that there was a search for ‘grey literature’ or ‘unpublished literature’ , indicate ‘yes’ . sigle database, 
dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. if searching a source 
that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit
5. Question: Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
explanation: a list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
note: acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. i f there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select ‘no’
6. Question: Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
explanation: in an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interven-
tions and outcomes. the ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeco -
nomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported
note: acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above
PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE    221
7. Question: Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
explanation: ‘a priori’ methods of assessment should be provided (e.g. for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only 
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types 
of studies alternative items will be relevant
note: can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a descrip -
tion of quality items, with some kind of result for each study (‘low’ or ‘high’ is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored ‘low’ and which scored ‘high’; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable)
8. Question: Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
explanation: the results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions 
of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations
note: Might say something such as ‘the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies’ . 
cannot score ‘yes’ for this question if scored ‘no’ for question 7
9. Question: Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
explanation: For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e. 
chi-squared test for homogeneity, i
2 ). if heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the 
clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e. is it sensible to combine?)
10. note: indicate ‘yes’ if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heteroge -
neity/variability between interventions
Question: Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
11. explanation: an assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g. funnel plot, other available tests) 
and/or statistical tests (e.g. e gger regression test, hedges- olken)
note: if no test values or funnel plot included, score ‘no’ . s core ‘yes’ if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed 
because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
Question: Was the conflict of interest included?
explanation: Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies
note: to get a ‘yes’ , must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review and for each of the included studies
total a MstaR s core:
