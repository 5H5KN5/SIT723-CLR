Abstract
Background: Brief interventions in primary healthcare are cost-effective in reducing drinking problems but poorly
implemented in routine practice. Although evidence about implementing brief interventions is growing, knowledge
is limited with regard to impact of initial role security and the rapeutic commitment on brief in tervention implementation.
Methods: In a cluster randomised factorial trial, 120 primary hea lthcare units (PHCUs) were randomised to eight groups:
care as usual, training and support, finan cial reimbursement, and the opportunit y to refer patients to an internet-based
brief intervention (e-BI); paired combinations of these three strategies, and all three strategies combined. To explore the
impact of initial role security and therapeutic commitment on implementing brief interventions, we performed multilevel
linear regression analyses ad apted to the factorial design.
Results: Data from 746 providers from 120 PHCUs were included in the analyses. Baseline role security and therapeutic
commitment were found not to influence implementation of brief interventions. Furthermore, there were no significant
interactions between these characteristi cs and allocated implementation groups.
Conclusions: The extent to which providers changed their brief inte rvention delivery following experience of different
implementation strategies was not determ ined by their initial attitudes towards alcohol problems. In future research,
more attention is needed to unravel the ca usal relation between practitioners ’attitudes, their actual behaviour and care
improvement strategies to enh ance implementation science.

Background
The World Health Organization Status Report on
Alcohol and Health documented that the level of alcohol
consumption in the European Union (EU) is almost
double the global average, as on average almost 2.5 alco-
holic drinks (25 g) per capita are consumed every day
[1]. Alcohol is an attributable cause of more than 200
three-digit International Classification of Disease (ICD)-
10 codes [2] and, in the age group of 15 –49 years, it is
the leading risk factor for the global burden of disease
[3]. In Europe, one in every seven deaths in men and
o n ei ne v e r y1 3d e a t h si nw o m e ni nt h eg r o u pa g e d
15–64 years is due to alcohol consumption [3].
I naC o c h r a n er e v i e w ,K a n e re ta l .s h o w e dt h a t
screening and brief interventions (SBI) in primary
healthcare to detect and intervene in risky alcohol
consumption are cost-effective in reducing alcohol
consumption with a mean difference of −38 g/week
after a year of follow-up. Included studies were per-
formed in English-speaking countries (UK, USA,
Canada, Australia) and various European countries.
No studies were based in transitional or developing
countries [4]. However, SBI are poorly implemented in
primary healthcare settings [5 –8]. The reasons for this
include providers ’lack of knowledge, low role security
and therapeutic commitment, lack of financial re-
sources and lack of time [9, 10]. Therapeutic commit-
ment refers to motivation, task-specific self-esteem
and work satisfaction towards patients with risky alco-
hol consumption. Role security refers to skills, know-
ledge and owning a role of working with risky drinkers
[11]. Previous research has shown that general practitioners
(GPs) with greater role security and therapeutic commit-
ment towards patients with risky alcohol consumption re-
port being more involved in managing alcohol-related
problems than others [12, 13]. In due course, there have
been several studies undertaken on methods to overcome
these barriers with implement ation strategies to embed SBI
in routine care [14 –16]. Van Beurden et al. (2012), for
instance, described that one of the reasons for failing in im-
proving SBI was sub-optimal implementation of the
programme [14]. The study of Funk et al. concluded that
adopting more direct dissem ination approaches for SBI
evidence-based programmes to GPs is a necessary first step
for changing practice behaviour [15]. These examples of
former studies, of which some we conducted on a large
scale, showed what worked su b-optimally; however, they
did not show yet what actually did work. Consequently, evi-
dence for optimally designed implementation strategies for
a wider uptake of SBI remains inconclusive [17]. To date, it
is unclear which provider characteristics influence imple-
mentation of brief interventions for risky alcohol consump-
tion. More specifically, it remains unclear to what extent
primary healthcare providers ’role security and therapeuticcommitment impact on the brief intervention implementa-
tion. A recent survey in eight European countries showed
that physicians who had received more education on alco-
hol and who had higher role security and therapeutic com-
mitment reported managing a higher number of patients
for alcohol and alcohol problems [10]. If providers ’baseline
role security and therapeutic commitment are not
accounted for in implementat ion programmes, interven-
tions can lead to a deterioration in role security and thera-
peutic commitment [12]. However, another trial showed a
lack of improvement in role security and brief intervention
delivery despite the extended implementation programme
that included addressing providers ’role security and thera-
peutic commitment [18]. So far, it still is unclear whether
positive attitudes are required to improve role security and
therapeutic commitment for im proving screening and brief
intervention delivery.
With more knowledge on the impact of role security
and therapeutic commitment, one may be able to adapt to
and take these into account within implementation pro-
grammes. The Optimizing Delivery of Healthcare Inter-
ventions (ODHIN; www.odhinproject.eu) trial increases
our knowledge on the best methods for improving brief
interventions ’frequency in primary healthcare. This trial
concerned a multifaceted programme to implement brief
interventions in routine primary healthcare, using specific
training and support on how to deal with alcohol-related
problems, financial reimbursement and the opportunity to
refer screen-positive patients to an internet-based brief
intervention (e-BI) as strategies. The trial showed that the
highest increase in screening and brief intervention activ-
ity was present in the primary healthcare units (PHCUs)
that received training and support combined with financial
reimbursement [19].
Based on the current evidence base, we hypothesised
that higher baseline role security and therapeutic
commitment might positively influence the impact of
training and support and financial reimbursement on
screening and brief advice [10, 18]. Therefore, the aim of
this paper was to evaluate whether providers ’initial role
security and therapeutic commitment impacted the eight
strategy types on implementing brief alcohol interven-
tions in PHCU across five countries in the European
Union.
Methods
This paper builds on the findings from the ODHIN trial,
which was focused on identifying implementation strategies
for implementing brief interv entions [19]. Therefore, the
methods section presents the main key ingredients of the
ODHIN study. More informat ion can be found in another
ODHIN paper that presents the trial effects on screening
and brief intervention activity. CONSORT guidelines were
followed in reporting the trial [20].Keurhorst et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:96 Page 2 of 8
Study design and participants
ODHIN was a cluster randomised 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial
as described in the study protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov.
Trial identifier: NCT01501552) [21]. English, Catalan,
Polish, Swedish and Dutch PHCUs participated and
combined their data to examine the effect of three differ-
ent implementation strategies (training and support,
financial reimbursement and referral opportunities to an
internet-based brief intervention programme) on screen-
ing and brief intervention activity for risky drinkers
identified by screening using the AUDIT-C question-
naire screening tool [22].
Implementation strategies
After formal agreement of the PHCUs to take part in
the trial, a four-week baseline measurement took place,
during which no trial interventions were administered.
After a 2- to 6-week gap, the 12-week implementation
period occurred with the start date for each country be-
tween November 2012 and May 2013. All eight alloca-
tion groups received the same input as controls but with
additional components added.
1. Control group: care as usual
2. Training and support (TS)
3. Financial reimbursement (FR)
4. Referral to internet-based brief interventions (e-BI)
5. TS and FR
6. TS and e-BI
7. FR and e-BI
8. TS, FR and e-BI
More details about the implementation strategies and
procedural activities were described in Additional file 1
[19, 21].
Measures
Brief intervention proportions
Brief intervention proportions were the primary out-
come of the ODHIN study. These were measured during
two time frames: during the four-week baseline period
and during the 12-week implementation period. The
providers completed paper tally sheets (Catalonia ap-
plied electronic tally sheets). The tally sheets included
AUDIT-C questions, AUDIT-C scores and tick boxes to
indicate the type of intervention (oral advice, an advice
leaflet, referral to the e-BI programme, or referral for ad-
vice to another provider in or outside the PHCU) that
was delivered.
The brief intervention proportions were calculated as
a number of AUDIT-C positive patients that received
one or more of oral advice, an advice leaflet, referral to
the e-BI programme, or referral for advice to another
provider in or outside the PHCUs, divided by the totalnumber of adult ( ≥18 years) consultations of the partici-
pating providers per PHCU. We added up all the patient
consultations in the 12-week implementation period and
calculated accordingly the proportion of AUDIT-C posi-
tive patients that received a brief intervention. Impact of
the implementation strategies on screening and brief ad-
vice activity was reported elsewhere [19].
Role security and therapeutic commitment
Before starting the baseline measurement of brief inter-
ventions, providers completed a questionnaire in which
they provided their demographical features, including
gender, age and occupation (e.g. medical practitioner,
nurse, practice assistant).
Role security and therapeutic commitment were mea-
sured at baseline by the short version of the Alcohol and
Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire (SAAPPQ),
translated into the native language of each participating
country [11]. The SAAPPQ is a validated instrument
based on factor analysis [11] of the original tool as de-
veloped and validated by Cartwright [23]. The shortened
version of the original attitude scale has been demon-
strated to be as representative and discriminatory as the
full AAPPQ scale [11]. The SAAPPQ has good test-
retest reliability and Cronbach ’s alpha in the range of 0.7
and 0.9 [11]. Furthermore, it has been applied in several
international contexts and with various disciplines (e.g.
[24–27]). All participating providers who provided writ-
ten informed consent were asked to complete the
SAAPPQ. Role security measures role adequacy, for ex-
ample “I feel I can appropriately advise my patients
about drinking and its effects ”, and role legitimacy, for
example, “I feel I have the right to ask patients questions
about their drinking when necessary ”. Role security is
expressed at the emotional level, whereas therapeutic
commitment measures motivation, for example “pessim-
ism is the most realistic attitude to take toward
drinkers ”; task specific self-esteem, for example “all in all
I am inclined to feel I am a failure with drinkers ”; and
work satisfaction, for example “in general, it is rewarding
to work with drinkers ”. Role security includes four items
on a seven-point Likert scale and summed scores range
between 4 and 28. Therapeutic commitment includes six
items on a seven-point Likert scale and summed scores
range between 6 and 42.
Sample size and randomisation
To achieve sufficient statistical power for significant ef-
fects on intervention proportions, it was estimated that
120 PHCUs (15 per eight allocation groups, evenly dis-
tributed between countries) would be needed [21].
Randomisation took place after formal agreement of
the PHCUs to take part in the trial. The PHCUs were
randomly allocated to one of the eight allocated groupsKeurhorst et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:96 Page 3 of 8
by the ODHIN coordinating centre, using computerised
randomisation, stratified by country (i.e. block random-
isation), ensuring 15 PHCUs per group (three per group
in each country) [21].
Statistical analysis
Because of the hierarchical structure (providers nested
within PHCU, nested within country), we performed a
two-level linear multilevel analysis (mixed model). We
performed a model with random intercept for countries
and practices, and other variables such as TS, FR, e-BI,
and baseline brief intervention proportion fixed. The
outcome measure was brief intervention proportion
after the implementation period. Multiple imputation
was not applied as the percentage of missing cases was
1.5 % [28].
When examining the impact of baseline role security
and therapeutic commitment on the 12-week brief
intervention proportions, examination of residuals
found them to be not symmetrically distributed
around zero, so the data underwent log transform-
ation, which provided a better fit. Prior to log trans-
formation, proportions with a value of zero were
assigned a value of 0.001. Coefficients for the com-
bined effects of TS + FR and TS + e-BI were the sum
of the individual coefficients. Since the data were log
transformed, the contrast coefficients are relative ef-
fects. The percentage difference in brief intervention
proportions with each implementation strategy asopposed to without, was calculated with the equation:
difference (%) = 100 × (exp)2 × coefficient estimate
from procedure MIXED minus 1. As this approach
creates some issues with outcomes with a zero value,
0.001 was added to each proportion. In order to test
the validity of this assumption, a sensitivity analysis
was undertaken using the exact proportions but ex-
cluding those PHCU with an outcome of zero.
Correlations between the eight variables were tested
with Pearson ’s correlation test. To test the influence of
baseline role security and therapeutic commitment on
the delivered brief interventions, the model was run with
both provider characteristics, included one by one.
When both characteristics significantly correlated, which
was expected as they were included in the same ques-
tionnaire, they were paired when entered included in the
statistical model. Furthermore, for both role security and
therapeutic commitment, we added interaction terms in
order to identify interactive effects of characteristics with
the implementation strategies. We considered a pvalue
<0.05 statistically significant. In case of interaction, sub-
groups of variables were analysed separately. The statis-
tical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS v20. The
datasets are available upon request.

providers throughout the parent trial. The 120 partici-
pating PHCUs with 746 providers were randomised and
Fig. 1 Trial flow chartKeurhorst et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:96 Page 4 of 8
included in the analyses. Table 1 shows baseline charac-
teristics of the participating providers. Almost three
quarters of the participating providers were women and
the mean age of all participating providers was 47.0 years
(SD 9.4). Occupations of participants varied, though
participants were mainly GPs or nurses. Most partici-
pating providers were employed in health clinics and
group practices. The mean number of consulting adult
patients per month per provider during the baseline
was 242, but varied greatly between providers with a
standard deviation of 188. Role security was high at
baseline, with a score of 21.0 (SD 3.5) within a pos-
sible range of 4 –28. Therapeutic commitment scored
on average 27.2 (SD 4.7) within a possible range of 6 –42.
There were no baseline differences observed between any
of the eight allocation groups; however, PHCU type, the
number of registered patients in the PHCU, and the num-
b e ro fc o n s u l t i n ga d u l tp a t i e n t sp e rp r o v i d e rw e r es i g n i f i -
cantly correlated with each other (health centres had the
highest number of registered patients and consultations,
and solo practices the lowest) (all p< 0.05).Influence of baseline role security and therapeutic
commitment on implementation
Baseline role security and therapeutic commitment were
significantly correlated with a Pearson correlation of
0.379 ( p< 0.001). This was accounted for in the analyt-
ical model by adding these as a pair to the statistical
model. Testing the influence of providers ’role security
and therapeutic commitment towards dealing with risky
drinking prior to the trial, that is, their baseline role se-
curity and therapeutic commitment, taking account for
the correlation between these characteristics, showed no
change in coefficients (i.e. not more than 10 % change)
of impact of the implementation strategies on brief
intervention implementation (Table 2). Furthermore,
there were no significant interactions between these
characteristics and allocated groups nor a difference in
impact between the provider groups with low (below
median score) or high levels (above median score).
Sensitivity analysis suggested the addition of 0.001 to
the observed outcome of a zero value. In order to test
the validity of this assumption, a sensitivity analysis was
undertaken using the exact proportions but excluding
those PHCU with an outcome of zero.
Discussion
The aim of this paper was to evaluate whether providers ’
initial role security and therapeutic commitment im-
pacted upon the eight intervention strategies, which
aimed to promote implementation of brief alcohol inter-
ventions in PHCU across five countries in the European
Union. Baseline role security and therapeutic commit-
ment both appeared to have no influence on implemen-
tation of brief interventions in this study, by neither
training and support (TS), financial reimbursement (FR),
nor the opportunity to refer patients to an internet-
based brief intervention (e-BI). This may suggest that
applied implementation strategies overwhelmed attitudes
to be conditional for improved screening and brief inter-
vention delivery.
The results of this study indicate that initial role secur-
ity and therapeutic commitment will not play a signifi-
cant role in the implementation process, including the
FR and TS strategies that were effective in raising brief
interventions. Factors that actually do play a significant
role in improvement of brief interventions by FR are still
unknown. In this study, the financial reimbursement
scheme differed per country. In Poland and Catalonia,
providers were reimbursed directly, whereas in Sweden
and the Netherlands, reimbursement was applied at a
PHCU level [21]. Nevertheless, in both reimbursement
schemes, FR could be regarded as an external brief inter-
vention motivator. We cannot explain the process be-
hind FR successes on country level, as it could not be
the country itself causing the effect, because theTable 1 Characteristics of participating providers

multilevel analysis model accounted for providers nested
within PHCUs, nested within the country. Reviews sup-
port the view of these still unexplained processes behind
FR implementation successes [29]. Therefore, more re-
search about implementation processes in this context is
needed, preferably to conduct a meta-analysis to en-
hance quality of evidence, since besides the ODHIN
study there are very few studies that tested FR effects on
alcohol brief intervention delivery. Additionally, it is also
reported that a pay for performance approach can be
used to improve the quality of care; however, it is not a
“magic bullet ”as it works optimally as part of a wider
implementation strategy programme [30].
The hypothesis that baseline provider ’s role security
and therapeutic commitment have a positive impact on
the number of patients managed for their risky alcohol
consumption [10, 12, 13] was not confirmed by this
study. Furthermore, in this study, the training and sup-
port strategy is both effective for providers with low and
high baseline role security and therapeutic commitment,
in contrast to the findings of Anderson et al.
(2004) where attitudinal levels deteriorated even for
those with low levels at baseline [12]. Moreover, com-
pared to the Anderson et al. study [12], role security and
therapeutic commitment were relatively high in the
ODHIN study. Having this combined with standard de-
viations of 3.5 and 4.7 on means of, respectively, 21 and
27.2 may reduce the likelihood of identifying these vari-
ables as moderating characteristics. In addition, as prac-
titioner brief intervention delivery was significantly
improved in this study, the results question the import-
ance of role security and therapeutic commitment in the
implementation process. However, besides possible ceil-
ing effects of the instrument measuring these attitudinal
constructs, we must acknowledge that in this study only
baseline role security and therapeutic commitment was
included, while these can evolve over time. So, our find-
ing does not rule out any importance of thesecharacteristics but merely indicate that the extent to
which providers managed to change their brief interven-
tion proportions when submitted to different implemen-
tation strategies was not determined by their initial
attitudes towards alcohol problems. In future research,
more attention is needed whether importance of role se-
curity and therapeutic commitment can be ruled out
when implementing alcohol brief interventions, as it can
inform us whether to focus on these or not in imple-
mentation trajectories.
The study had strengths and limitations. The imple-
mentation strategies were applied in all five countries,
but the specific content was tailored to the country con-
text. To preserve comparability between countries, we
formulated minimum requirements that country-specific
implementation strategies had to meet. For the remain-
der, countries had flexibility in making the strategies
compatible with country standards. Therefore, we think
that these results are valuable for policy makers from
different European countries, especially with outcomes
of this process analyses. Another issue that deserves dis-
cussion is the enrolment rate of 19 %. Only one in five
practices consented to participate, which may indicate
that only motivated providers participated. This suggests
that implementation strategy effects may be lower as re-
ported in the ODHIN study. A strength was the hier-
archical structure of individual providers being nested
within PHCU, and PHCU being nested within country,
which was taken into account in the analyses. Lastly, the
five participating countries differ in their organisation of
primary healthcare and in their burden of alcohol con-
sumption as well as their drinking patterns. Therefore,
our findings could be generalised to other western coun-
tries as well.
A limitation of the study is the tally sheet to measure
AUDIT-C outcomes, that may be a source of bias. Pro-
viders could check boxes for interventions being done,
without the researchers ’check if the interventionTable 2 Impact of baseline role security and therapeutic commitment on the relative per cent difference in the proportion of

actually was carried out. Besides, the tally sheet already
included options of interventions, which may have been
an intervention in itself. Another weakness of the study
is the lack of results concerning the country-specific ef-
fects of our implementation strategies, as the study was
powered on the total of five countries. Consequently, the
cross-cultural differences between the countries were
not addressed. However, this was not the primary goal of
this international study. An ideal study design would be
a design with sufficient power to assess inter-country
differences. Furthermore, in order to make the design
less difficult to interpret, instead of a factorial design, a
stepped wedge could be selected to assess comparable
implementation strategies as evaluated in the ODHIN
study.
Conclusions
In this study, providers ’baseline role security and thera-
peutic commitment had no discernible impact on imple-
menting brief interventions. The extent to which
providers managed to change their brief intervention
proportions when subjected to different implementation
strategies was not determined by their initial attitudes
towards alcohol problems. In future research, more at-
tention is needed to unravel the causal relation between
practitioners ’attitudes, their actual behaviour and care
improvement strategies to enhance implementation sci-
ence, as it can inform us whether to focus on these or
not in implementation trajectories.
