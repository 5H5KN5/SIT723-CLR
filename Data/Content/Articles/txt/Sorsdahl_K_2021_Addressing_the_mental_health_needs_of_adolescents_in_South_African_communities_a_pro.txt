Abstract
Background: Like many low- and middle-income countries, almost half of the proportion of the South African
population is under the age of 25. Given the peak age of onset for most mental health problems is in adolescence,
it is vital that adolescents have access to mental health counselling. There are several initiatives to increase access
to mental health counselling in South Africa, primarily through the integration of counselling for common mental
disorders (CMD) into primary health care services, but adolescents (15 –18 years of age) generally do not utilize
these services. To address this gap, we will undertake a study to explore the feasibility of conducting a trial of the
effectiveness of a community-based mental health counselling intervention for adolescents at-risk for a CMD.
Methods: The study is a feasibility trial of the ASPIRE intervention, a four-session blended multi-component
counselling intervention adapted for South African adolescents at risk for depression and alcohol use disorders. We
will enrol 100 adolescents from community settings and randomly assign them to the ASPIRE intervention or a
comparison condition. Feasibility measures, such as rates of recruitment, consent to participate in the trial and
retention, will be calculated. Qualitative interviews with participants and counsellors will explore the acceptability of
the intervention. The primary outcomes for a subsequent trial would be reductions in symptoms of depression and
days of heavy drinking which will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-randomization.
Discussion: This feasibility trial using a mixed-methods design will allow us to determine whether we can move
forward to a larger effectiveness trial of the ASPIRE intervention.
Trial registration: The trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR20200352214510).

Background
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are home
to more than a billion adolescents, with a high propor-
tion of adolescents and young people living in Africa [ 1].
Mental and substance use disorders are among the lead-
ing causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) among
children and youth up to the age of 24 years globally, ac-
counting for 25% of YLDs in this age group [ 2]. Early
intervention for these disorders is critical given an indi-
vidual ’s health and behaviors in childhood and adoles-
cence lay the foundation for health in later years, and
impact on the health of their offspring [ 3]. Moreover,
the well-being of adolescents is integrally linked to
socio-economic development in LMICs [ 4], including
South Africa.
Like many LMICs, there is a significant mental
health treatment gap in South Africa. Approximately
30% and 17% of adults in South Africa meet diagnos-
tic criteria for a lifetime and past year mental
disorder respectively, yet less than a quarter ever re-
ceive treatment [ 5]. There have been several initiatives
to increase access to mental health counselling in
South Africa, primarily through the integration of
community health worker-delivered counselling for
common mental disorders (such as depression and
alcohol use disorders) into primary health care (PHC)
services [ 6–8]. While these efforts are starting to re-
duce the treatment gap for adults who access PHC
services, adolescents rarely use health services offered
on the primary care platform. Where youth-friendly
clinics are available, these do not offer mental health
counselling. Moreover, data suggests that at-risk ado-
lescents globally and in South Africa under-utilize
mental health services [ 9,10] with only 30% of this
at-risk population seeking help for mental health
problems [ 11].
Failure to reach adolescents is a major service and
treatment gap given this is the peak age of onset for
most mental health problems. If left untreated, these
problems predict adverse life trajectories [ 12]. Adoles-
cents who do not seek or access mental health services
run the risk of developing more advanced psychopath-
ology in adulthood [ 13,14] and are at greater risk for
physical health comorbidities and injury [ 15]. For
example, heavy alcohol use during adolescence may
contribute to unsafe sex practices that increase the likeli-
hood of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted
infections, such as HIV [ 16]. Addressing mental health
problems at an early stage may also alleviate the long-
term costs to society and the public health system of
untreated mental disorders [ 17].
While there is some promising evidence for effective
interventions to promote mental health among adoles-
cents globally [ 18–22], available evidence from SouthAfrica for the effectiveness of these interventions is pri-
marily focussed on adults. There is evidence from South
Africa to suggest that brief, structured counselling inter-
ventions, when task-shared to trained community health
workers (CHWs), may improve mental health outcomes
among adults [ 8]. Motivational interviewing (MI), behav-
ioral activation, and problem-solving therapy (PST), are
recommended interventions from the World Health Or-
ganization ’s programme to reduce the mental health
treatment gap [ 23]. In South Africa, 3 –4 sessions of
counselling that included elements of these recom-
mended interventions improved depression and alcohol
outcomes among patients presenting to healthcare facili-
tates [ 8]. There is good evidence that combining MI and
cognitive behavioral treatments (CBT) leads to improved
outcomes for people with depression [ 24,25], alcohol
and other substance use disorders [ 8], as well as those
with comorbid alcohol use disorders and depression
[26]. Despite both MI and CBT approaches (such as PST
and behavioral activation) being used to intervene with
adolescents in high-income countries [ 21,27,28], this
blended multi-component counselling intervention had
not yet been tested among this population in South
Africa.
This paper describes the study protocol for a feasibility
trial of the ASPIRE intervention, a multi-component
counselling intervention for South African adolescents at
risk for a common mental disorder (specifically depres-
sion and alcohol use disorders). This feasibility trial aims
to provide the early evidence needed to help service
planners develop and implement adolescent-oriented
counselling. It is hoped that the findings from this feasi-
bility trial will lay the groundwork for a future effective-
ness trial of the ASPIRE intervention.
Feasibility trial objectives
In this feasibility trial, standard trial procedures will
be implemented to obtain information on the accept-
ability and feasibility of the ASPIRE intervention for
South African adolescents, including safety consider-
ations. We will also assess the feasibility of our study
methods and counselling, training and supervision
model that has been adapted for this population [ 29].
Using a mixed-methods design with qualitative and
quantitative approaches, this feasibility trial will allow
us to identify and refine issues pertaining to recruit-
ment, retention, intervention delivery, data collection,
randomization, and blinding prior to a future effect-
iveness trial.
The primary objectives are to (i) test the feasibility and
acceptability of the ASPIRE intervention as well as (ii)
the feasibility of all study procedures and performance
of outcome measures to inform a fully powered future
trial. A second objective is to explore the initial effect ofSorsdahl et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:69 Page 2 of 14
this intervention on days of heavy drinking and symp-
toms of depression.
Methods
This protocol is reported in accordance with the guide-
lines presented in the Standard Protocol Items: Recom-
mendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist
[30] and the Template Intervention Description and
Replication guidelines [ 31].
Trial design
An individually randomized two-arm feasibility trial,
with embedded qualitative interviews will be conducted
(see Consort diagram in Fig. 1). We will enrol 100
adolescents from community settings and randomly
assign them to the ASPIRE intervention or a comparison
condition. Participants will be tracked for 6-week and 3-
month post-randomization follow-up assessments.
Study setting
We will recruit participants from a mix of communities
in and around Cape Town within the Western Cape
(WC) province of SA. These communities arecharacterized by high levels of unemployment (> 70%)
and CMDs among young people [ 32]. Study activities
will take place at the South African Medical Research
Council ’s clinical research site in Delft, which is within
easy access of several of these communities and at
community-based organizations that provide services for
at-risk adolescents and their families.
Participants
To be eligible for inclusion in this study, participants
must (1) be aged between 15 and 18 years old; (2) pro-
vide written informed assent/consent to participate in
the study; (3) have written informed parental consent to
participate if younger than 18 years of age; (4) screen at
risk for depression with a score ≥10 on the Center for
Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale short form (CES-
D-10 [ 33];) and/or screen at moderate or severe risk for
alcohol-related health problems, with a score ≥5 on the
Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Use Involvement Test-
Youth (ASSIST-Y [ 34]); and report at least 2 episodes of
heavy drinking ( ≥5 standard drinks on a single occa-
sion) in the last month. Participants will be excluded if
Fig. 1 Consort diagram of the study designSorsdahl et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:69 Page 3 of 14
they are currently receiving any form of treatment for a
mental or substance use disorder.
Participant recruitment and study procedures
We will use established community-based outreach
techniques in organizations and places that adolescents
frequent to identify potential participants. These
methods were used successfully in previous studies to
recruit larger samples of vulnerable populations, includ-
ing youth [ 35]. While all contact with adolescents - in-
cluding assessments and counselling sessions - has been
planned as occurring face-to-face, the team may conduct
telephonic recruitment, assessments or counselling ses-
sions where necessary. Fieldworkers will approach po-
tential participants in various community settings. After
explaining the purpose of the study, the fieldworker will
request verbal consent to screen the adolescent for pos-
sible study inclusion. If the adolescent is not eligible,
they will be thanked for their time and given health in-
formation materials. If they are eligible, but do not pro-
vide consent, reasons for lack of interest will be
recorded. Where parental consent is not required, an ap-
pointment will be made for a study enrolment visit with
eligible and interested adolescents. If parental consent is
required, the fieldworker will contact the parent to ob-
tain this prior to making an appointment for an enrol-
ment visit. The fieldworker will follow a script for this
discussion with the adolescent ’s parent and will not dis-
close the mental health criteria on which their child was
eligible. If the parent refuses to consent, the adolescent
will not be enrolled.
At the enrolment visit that will take place at the South
African Medical Research Council ’s (SAMRC) clinical
research site in Delft, the fieldworker will re-screen the
participant to confirm study eligibility prior to obtaining
written informed consent/assent to participate in the
trial. Thereafter the fieldworker will administer the base-
line assessment in either English, Afrikaans, or isiXhosa,
the three official languages of the Western Cape prov-
ince. The assessment includes socio-demographic infor-
mation as well as information on mental health and
behavioral problems, family relationships; and social
support. All participants will then be matched with a
trained ASPIRE counsellor to receive a counselling ses-
sion. After counselling is completed, the trial manager
will assign the participants to the intervention or com-
parison group. The counselling session will take place
the same day as enrolment. A further three counselling
appointments will be scheduled for adolescents allocated
to the intervention group. These will be spaced at least a
week apart from each other. Participants will have six
weeks from enrolment to complete all four sessions,
whereafter a participant will time out of the intervention.
Irrespective of study arm, all participants will be askedto return for follow-up assessments at 6-week and 3-
month post-enrolment. During these follow-up visits, a
fieldworker will re-administer the baseline assessments.
Participants will have 30 days from their scheduled ap-
pointment to complete these follow-up assessments be-
fore timing out of that appointment.
A random sample of approximately 30 adolescents
who received the ASPIRE intervention will be recruited
to participate in qualitative interviews to explore their
perceptions of (1) intervention acceptability and sugges-
tions for modification; (2) feasibility of study procedures;
and (3) barriers and facilitators to participation and re-
tention in counselling. These will take place after their
final follow-up assessment. Counsellors delivering the
intervention will also be interviewed to examine their
experience of delivering the intervention and to identify
any barriers and facilitators to intervention delivery.
Transport or costs associated with transport required to
attend study or counselling appointments will be pro-
vided or reimbursed. Participants will receive grocery
vouchers for completing the baseline and follow-up
assessments.
Randomization and blinding
Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to
either the intervention or comparison arm. The
randomization sequence will be prepared by the data
manager (using a computer programme) and allocation
will be done by a trial manager. The fieldworkers will
phone the trial manager when an individual is ready to
be allocated, and the trial manager will inform the field-
worker about the participant ’s allocation based on the
randomization sequence. The fieldworker will then no-
tify the participant about his/her allocation and associ-
ated activities. Investigators will be blind to the sequence
generation. The trial manager will have no direct con-
tact with participants, and all allocations will be con-
cealed until the individual is assigned to a study arm.
To reduce potential performance bias, allocations will
only occur after the first counselling session has been
completed. Fieldworkers will conduct the baseline and
follow-up assessments, and trained counsellors will
deliver the intervention. Fieldworkers conducting the
follow-up assessments will be blinded to the
randomization arm. Counsellors delivering the inter-
vention and fieldworkers (serving as outcome asses-
sors) will function independently of each other.
Counsellors will not conduct any assessments, ensur-
ing that these assessments remain independent from
the counselling sessions.
Interventions
Irrespective of study arm, the interventions will be deliv-
ered in a face-to-face format by trained and experiencedSorsdahl et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:69 Page 4 of 14
health counsellors. These counsellors are increasingly
being used in health and community settings in South
Africa to deliver structured psychosocial interventions
and are part of the National Department of Health ’splans to scale up the provision of mental health
counselling through task-sharing structured interven-
tions. We have successfully used these counsellors to
deliver other psychosocial interventions and haveTable 1 Components of the ASPIRE intervention package

shown that patients prefer lay counsellors to whom
they can relate rather than other health workers [ 36,
37]. See Table 1for a detailed description of the
ASPIRE intervention package.
Comparison arm: session 1 and referral to care
Participants assigned to this arm will have received a
single counselling session (~ 1 h in duration) prior to al-
location. This is session one of the ASPIRE intervention,
and the content and delivery of this session will be iden-
tical to that received by participants assigned to the
intervention condition. The session includes screening
for heavy alcohol use and depression, feedback about the
screening results and levels of risk, psycho-education
about how alcohol or feelings of depression can affect
young people, and (depending on their primary condi-
tion), motivational interviewing to enhance motivation
to reduce alcohol use or behavioral activation to address
symptoms of depression. The session will conclude with
the participant setting personal goals and developing a
plan for change, guided by the counsellor. Participants
will also be given referrals to usual care providers for
further follow-up if required.
Intervention arm (ASPIRE intervention)
Participants assigned to this condition will receive
session one as described above, plus an additional three
sessions of a blended multi-component counselling
intervention that has shown efficacy in other studies [ 8].
The goals of this intervention are to motivate partici-
pants to make changes to their risk behaviors and
strengthen their problem-solving skills to help them
cope better with stress and life problems that are risk
factors for common mental disorders. The intervention
is largely based on Lazarus and Folkman ’s[38] coping
theory, teaches problem-focused coping skills for mut-
able problems and emotion-focused coping strategies
(acceptance and seeking support) for immutable prob-
lems. In this approach, heavy alcohol use is viewed as a
form of problem avoidance (maladaptive emotion-
focused coping) and depression, a response to maladap-
tive emotion-focused coping [ 38]. See Fig. 2for a con-
ceptual model of the ASPIRE intervention. Each session
functions iteratively to build readiness to change and
adaptive problem-solving and coping skills. All sessions
have a motivational component, a psycho-education
component (in which participants are taught problem-
solving skills and how to apply them) and include an op-
portunity to apply newly learned skills through exercises
and homework. More specifically, participants are taught
steps for addressing problems that are important and
can be solved; strategies for dealing with negative and
intrusive worries that are unimportant; and steps for
coping with problems that are important but cannot besolved [ 8,39]. Participants will also be taught techniques
for managing uncomfortable emotions. A patient hand-
book, summarizing the content of the counselling ses-
sions and containing worksheets that participants use to
practice the problem-solving method, is used to guide
counselling. The handbook is available in English, Afri-
kaans, or isiXhosa (the three official languages of the
Western Cape). From enrolment, participants in the
intervention arm will have 6 weeks to receive all four
sessions of the intervention. Each counselling session
should be spaced at least 5 days apart, with the first
session occurring immediately after the baseline assess-
ment. The duration of each counselling session is ap-
proximately 45 –60 min.
Counsellor training and supervision
ASPIRE counsellors selected to be trained will already
have basic counselling training. For this study, they will
receive an additional 40 h of training in understanding
common mental disorders, screening for hazardous/
harmful alcohol use and depression, principles of basic
counselling (including confidentiality), motivational
interviewing and problem-solving therapy (with profi-
ciency testing through role-playing and case examples),
providing referrals, and responding to distressed partici-
pants. Prior to the start of training, counsellors will
complete an assessment of their knowledge, attitudes,
beliefs, and practices around counselling for common
mental disorders, and these will be assessed after com-
pletion of training to evaluate the impact of training.
Following training and continuing throughout the im-
plementation of the interventions, counsellors will par-
ticipate in regular face-to-face and virtual supervision
and debriefing that will be conducted by a registered
psychological counsellor (see Table 1for further details).
The content of supervision will include review of the lo-
gistics of implementing the intervention (to troubleshoot
any barriers), a review of participants ’progress and
debriefing about challenges, feedback from fidelity
checks about the quality of intervention delivery, and
how it can be improved. Counsellors will take notes after
each counselling session, which will be reviewed during
supervision by the counsellor supervisor. Supervision
will also be an opportunity for on-going booster training,
as and when required. If quality assurance activities indi-
cate that some counsellors require more training in the
intervention, this will be provided. The number of hours
spent on training, supervision, and debriefing per indi-
vidual counsellor will be recorded in a training and
supervision log. The counsellor supervisor in turn will
be supervised by a psychologist. Supervision sessions will
be recorded for fidelity and reviewed, with feedback pro-
vided to improve the quality of supervision. We haveSorsdahl et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:69 Page 6 of 14
used this model of supervision successfully in our previ-
ous work [ 29].
Counsellor competency and monitoring
To assess and monitor counsellor competency in both
arms, we will audio-tape counselling sessions with con-
sent from participants. For the comparison arm, coun-
sellors ’competency in delivering session 1 will be
assessed. For participants in the intervention arm, one
session will be randomly selected from the total number
of completed sessions to be assessed for counsellor com-
petency. Both treatment-specific competencies and core
therapeutic competencies will be assessed by the coun-
selling supervisor.
For treatment-specific competencies (often referred to
as fidelity), an intervention delivery checklist will be used
which includes items pertaining to (1) use of a motiv-
ational interviewing counselling style; (2) dosage (dur-
ation of counselling session and amount of time spent
on non-intervention related topics); and (3) whether the
objectives of the intervention session were addressed
adequately. For this project, we will rate these compe-
tencies using Likert scales, with 1 being “not at all
present ”and 5 being “present most of the time. For core
competencies, a South African version of the ENhancing
Assessment of Common Therapeutic Factors [ 40] will
be used to measure core therapeutic competencies andskills that are thought to be required for a counsellor to
adequately deliver any evidence-based intervention.
Feasibility outcomes
The schedule of data collection is shown in (Fig. 3) the
SPIRIT Figure. The primary objective of this study is to
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the ASPIRE
intervention, and the trial procedures required for the
implementation of a future effectiveness trial. In line
with recommendations for the reporting of pilot studies
[41], we have identified several quantitative and qualita-
tive indicators of feasibility and acceptability that will be
used to guide decisions about what procedures to carry
through to the full trial and when modifications to pro-
cedures or intervention content and delivery should be
made. These include (1) feasibility of recruitment; (2)
appropriateness of data collection processes and
outcome measures; (3) retention in the ASPIRE inter-
vention; (4) counsellor competency; (5) feasibility of
randomization and blinding; (6) presence of adverse ad-
vents; and (7) acceptability of the ASPIRE intervention
and study procedures. Table 2describes these indicators,
how they will be evaluated and pre-determined progres-
sion criteria (where applicable). Progression criteria have
been set to facilitate the interpretation of results and to
inform whether to proceed to a definitive trial after the
feasibility study.

Measures to assess participant-level clinical outcomes
Although clinical outcomes in this feasibility trial are
secondary to the feasibility outcomes, we plan to collect
data on our planned outcomes for a future trial to estab-
lish the feasibility of using the proposed measures. Mea-
sures will be considered feasible if fewer than 15% of
items are incomplete (see Table 2).
Proposed primary trial outcome measures
All primary outcomes are at the level of the individual
patient and will be collected at baseline and at the two
follow-up assessments (see Fig. 3).
Percent of heavy drinking days in the past month
We will use the Alcohol Timeline Follow Back (TLFB)
technique to collect self-reported frequency, quantity,
volume, patterns, and types of alcohol consumption.
This will be used to calculate the percent of heavy
drinking days (> 60 g absolute alcohol) in the past
month [ 42].Alcohol severity
Alcohol use will be measured using Alcohol, Smoking
and Substance Use Involvement Test - youth (ASSIST-
Y) scores [ 34]. The ASSIST-Y for adolescents aged 15 –
17 will be used. This measure categorizes people into
low, moderate, or high risk for substance-related prob-
lems. Those with alcohol scores < 5 are considered low
risk,≥5 and ≤17 are considered at moderate risk, and ≥
18 are considered high risk. This outcome is restricted
to adolescents who report alcohol problems at baseline.
Symptoms of depression
We will use the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D-10), a 10-item scale that
measures depressive feelings and behaviors during the
past week to assess change in symptom severity on this
outcome. This outcome is restricted to those with CES-
D > = 10 at baseline. The CES-D 10 has been validated
for use in South Africa and with adolescents [ 43,44]
and has shown good psychometric properties. A cut-off
score of 10 indicates risk of depression, with scores
ranging from 0 to 30 [ 45].Table 2 Overview of feasibility and acceptability outcomes and progression criteria

Secondary outcome measures
Coping and problem-solving
Social problem-solving will be assessed using the Social
Problem-Solving Inventory - Adolescent version, short
form (SPSI-A, [ 46]. The SPSI-A SF consists of 30 items
organized into three scales: Automatic Process, Problem
Orientation, and Problem-Solving Skills.
Tobacco and other drug use
We will use the ASSIST-Y [ 34] to assess use of tobacco
and other drugs. The ASSIST-Y collects information on
frequency of tobacco and other drug as well as severity
of risk for tobacco and other drug-related problems.
Anxiety
We will use the generalized disorder scale (GAD-7) to
assess the severity of self-reported symptoms of general-
ized anxiety. The scale has been shown to have good
psychometric properties [ 47,48].
Family relationships
We will use the 10-item Family Involvement subscale of
the Behavioral and Emotional Rating scale to assess the
adolescent ’s relationship with their family [ 49,50].
Self-esteem
This will be measured using the 8-item Global Self
Worth subscale of the Self Esteem Questionnaire [ 51].
This sub-scale has demonstrated high validity and ad-
equate psychometric properties in South African adoles-
cents [ 52].
Social support
The Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Sup-
port (MSPSS) [ 53] will be used to assess social support
from family, friends and significant others. This instru-
ment has been shown to have good concurrent, con-
struct and discriminant validity, and high internal and
test re-test reliability [ 53] and good reliability and valid-
ity with adolescents [ 54].
School involvement
We will use the School Functioning subscale (9 items) of
the Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS) to as-
sess the adolescents ’performance and competence in
school. This scale assesses aspects such as attention in
class and completion of school tasks [ 50].
Sample size considerations
As we are not testing effect sizes in this feasibility trial, a
power calculation is not required. Recommendations for
sample size requirements to estimate key design parame-
ters from external feasibility and pilot randomized con-
trolled trials suggest that at least 70 measured subjects(35 per group) are required when estimating the SD for
a continuous outcome [ 55]. Therefore, we will recruit
100 participants (50 per group) to account for attrition.
Data analysis
The quantitative outcomes of interest (see Table 2) will
be summarized descriptively using appropriate summary
statistics (mean and standard deviation for continuous
outcomes and numbers and proportions for categorical
outcomes) and presented graphically over time for both
study arms.
We will explore clinical outcomes. In these exploratory
analyses, we will calculate means and confidence inter-
vals of clinical outcomes (both within- and between-
study groups) and determine which outcomes are most
sensitive to change. We will evaluate the parameters re-
quired to inform the sample size calculation for a future
main trial. We will also assess change in clinical out-
comes using an intention-to-treat analysis. Outcomes
will be compared between intervention and control
groups using linear regression models, adjusting for the
baseline score of the given outcome. We will create sep-
arate models for alcohol and depression and only in-
clude participants who screen at risk at baseline. The
two primary outcomes will be ascertained at three time-
points for each participant. This repeated measure fea-
ture will be used to estimate the intervention effects and
95% confidence intervals for the two primary outcomes
at 6 weeks and 3 months for the contrast between the
intervention and comparison condition.
Qualitative data will be coded with NVivo and ana-
lyzed using the framework approach [ 56]. Transcripts of
interviews will be read for emergent themes and then
coded. Coding and analysis will continue iteratively. Two
project staff will code the transcripts; they will meet after
the first five transcripts, and thereafter after every 10
transcripts, to compare notes. Cohen ’s Kappa will be
used to measure inter-coder agreement. Following the
Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies
(COREQ), we will document the process according to
the 32-item checklist [ 57].
Ethical considerations
The South African Medical Research Council (SAMR
CEC 012-8-2018), the University of Cape Town (276/
2018) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine (17873) provided ethical approval for this
study. The trial is registered with the Pan African Clin-
ical Trials Registry (PACTR20200352214510).
Informed consent
Prior to eligibility screening, the fieldworker will briefly
describe the study before requesting verbal consent to
screen the person for possible study inclusion. We willSorsdahl et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:69 Page 10 of 14
not use the information collected on the screener for
any purposes other than to describe reasons for study in-
eligibility. Parental consent and adolescent assent or
consent will be obtained from all potential individual
participants prior to enrolment. Prospective participants
will be informed of all foreseeable risks of study involve-
ment, that participation is voluntary and that they may
withdraw their consent at any times. The consent and
assent forms are available in English, Afrikaans, and
isiXhosa, the main languages spoken in the region.
Confidentiality
The confidentiality of the participant will be respected
and maintained at screening, recruitment, data entry,
storage, analysis, and dissemination of findings stages.
To ensure confidentiality, a unique participant identifi-
cation number will link the various study forms. The
study database will be password-protected following
standard password safety procedures. The data manager
will review these data daily for quality assurance and
quality control purposes. All data will be stored in
double-locked filing cabinets in designated locked of-
fices. Forms with personal identifying information will
be stored separately from case report forms. All partici-
pant case report forms will be kept in locked study-
dedicated file cabinets at the SAMRC. Confidentiality
will be broken in the case of threat of imminent harm to
self or others and/or the abuse or neglect of a child. The
informed consent forms state these exceptions to the
promise of confidentiality. All fieldworkers and counsel-
lors will be trained in how to manage issues of harm to
self or others that a participant might raise during data
collection or counselling. In these instances, participants
will be informed about the need to breach confidentiality
in such situations.
Anticipated risks
The main risk associated with this study is the potential
mental discomfort that may arise from material covered
in the assessments or intervention sessions. This will be
minimized by using experienced and well-trained field-
workers and counsellors and the option of referral to
mental health and substance use services in both arms.
Staff will be trained on how to identify distressed partici-
pants who may be at risk of harm and will be supported
in managing these participants telephonically during the
patient contact time, and during regular supervision and
debriefing sessions. For participants who are distressed
and at risk of harm, we will actively refer and link them
to appropriate resources to help them cope and deal
with their distress. A further risk shared with other psy-
chotherapy interventions is initial worsening of symp-
toms and risk of suicide arising from issues uncovered
during counselling. To minimize this potential harm, wewill train staff to screen all participants who report or
display signs of distress for risk of suicide (using the
Columbia Suicide Severity rating [ 58] scale and to pro-
vide referrals to specialized mental health services.
All adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events
(SAEs) that are reported by the participant or observed
by the field workers or counsellors will be recorded. All
staff will be trained to follow the Distressed Participant
Protocol that provides the process of reporting and sup-
porting/referral in case of any adverse events. All AEs
and SAEs will be reported to a local independent Trial
Steering Committee (TSC).
Trial management
A trial management team (TMT) will be formed com-
prising the PIs, other investigators, the counselling
supervisor and the trial manager. The TMT will be re-
sponsible for the day to day running of the trial and will
meet approximately once a week during the trial. The
TMT will provide feedback on trial progress to the Trial
Steering Committee (TSC) that will be convened to pro-
vide overall supervision of the trial, ensure its conduct is
in accordance with the principles of relevant regulations,
and monitor data and trial safety.
Discussion
This study is likely to contribute to the small body of
global evidence on promising trans-diagnostic counsel-
ling interventions for at-risk adolescents. First, although
a number of studies in LMICs have explored interven-
tions for the prevention and treatment of mental health
problems in adolescents, most of these interventions
were delivered in school settings and focus on a single
disorder, namely behavioral problems [ 59] or post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [ 60,61], with only a
few interventions targeting depression [ 62]. Further, the
evidence for the effectiveness of brief interventions for
problematic alcohol use is limited [ 63] with no available
data from LMICs. Alcohol use and depression are major
issues among adolescents in the Western Cape. A pro-
vincial school survey of 10,301 learners found that 25%
of the adolescents who reported lifetime alcohol use,
were heavy episodic drinkers and 56% of learners were
at moderate to high risk of mental health problems [ 32,
64]. Given this blended multi-component counselling
intervention has previously demonstrated acceptability,
feasibility, and efficacy in adults with CMDs [ 8,65], we
believe it has the potential to be similarly beneficial for
adolescents following necessary age-appropriate modifi-
cations to content and delivery approaches, which were
completed during the formative work for this study.
Second, findings may help guide the design of mental
health counselling services that are feasible to imple-
ment, acceptable to adolescents, and relevant for theirSorsdahl et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:69 Page 11 of 14
needs. As such, this study may help guide the implemen-
tation of South Africa ’s mental health policy framework
that focuses on expanding mental health service cover-
age to under-served populations, including at-risk ado-
lescents. It will also assist the Western Cape Department
of Health (WCDOH) in reaching its health service goals
for 2030 by guiding decision-making about how to en-
hance service coverage to all populations in need of
health care. Findings from the proposed study therefore
have the potential to contribute to the transformation of
the South African health care system. Further, if the
ASPIRE intervention is shown to be feasible and has
promising outcomes, it is likely to be applicable to other
low-resourced settings.
Third, the proposed feasibility trial using a mixed-
methods design will allow us to determine whether we
can move forward to a larger effectiveness trial of the
ASPIRE intervention. If our pre-specified qualitative or
quantitative indicators highlight concerns regarding feasi-
bility and acceptability impacting recruitment, retention,
intervention delivery, data collection, randomization,
blinding or safety, those relevant procedures will be modi-
fied accordingly. Should we find that significant modifica-
tions are required, we will consider the need for an
internal pilot in the context of the full trial [ 66].
Despite these contributions and strengths of the pro-
posed study, we anticipate some challenges to certain as-
pects of trial implementation. Recruitment of individual
participants may pose challenges given that 15 –17-year-
olds will require parental consent. Previous research
with alcohol use interventions reported lower rates of
study enrolment and a bias towards participants with
lower levels of alcohol use [ 67]. This was attributed to
adolescents ’perception that their parents might learn
about their alcohol use [ 63]. To address this challenge,
parental consent is being sought after initial screening.
Given that the inclusion criteria for study participation
includes both depression and alcohol use, limited in-
formation on why the adolescent qualifies for the
study will be disclosed. Further, retention of partici-
pants in a four-session inte rvention and through the
l i f e s p a no ft h es t u d ym a yp o s es o m ec h a l l e n g e s .W e
have a comprehensive strategy to limit attrition (in-
cluding reimbursement of transport costs) that has
been used in other studies where we have obtained
more than 80% follow-up rates [ 35].
In summary, this study has the potential to fill an
important knowledge gap reg arding promising trans-
diagnostic counselling interventions for at-risk adoles-
cents. Evidence generated by this study will be of
direct relevance to current efforts to reform the
public health system in South Africa and other
LMICs where there is a focus on expanding access to
mental health care to adolescents.Trial status
Recruitment for the trial began on 4 November 2019.
Due to COVID-19, all non-essential community-based
research was put on hold from 17 March 2020. Between
4 November 2019 and 18 March 2020, a total of 67
participants (33 treatment and 34 comparison) were
recruited into the ASPIRE trial. Of these, 15 had com-
pleted all study activities by the time the study was
paused. Seventeen participants in the intervention arm
still had counselling sessions to complete, and 38 and 48
participants still required either 6-week or 3-month
follow-up assessments, respectively. To reduce the risk
of loss to follow-up, counselling sessions and follow-up
assessments are currently being conducted telephonic-
ally for participants already recruited in the study. We
are in the process of establishing a protocol to reduce
the risk of COVID-19 transmission for when the ASPI
RE trial is permitted to resume recruitment.
