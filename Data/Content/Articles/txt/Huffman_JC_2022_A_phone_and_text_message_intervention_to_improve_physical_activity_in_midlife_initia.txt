ABSTRACT
Background: Physical activity during midlife (ages 45-64) plays a major
role in the prevention of chronic and serious medical conditions.
Unfortunately, many midlife adults struggle to be physically active in
the setting of low levels of psychological well-being and the
management of multiple con ﬂuent sources of stress. E ﬀective,
scalable, midlife-speci ﬁc interventions are needed to promote physical
activity and prevent the developme nt of chronic medical conditions.
Objectives: In an initial proof-of-concept trial, we assessed the
feasibility and acceptability of a new, midlife-adapted, phone- and
text message-based intervention using positive psychology (PP)
skill-building and motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. Wesecondarily analyzed post-intervention changes in accelerometer-
measured physical activity and self-reported outcomes.
Methods: The PP-MI intervention included six weekly phone sessions
with a study trainer, with completion of PP activities and physical
activity goals between calls, and in the subsequent six weeks brieferphone check-ins were conducted. Text messages over the 12-week
intervention period were utilized to support participants and identify
barriers to goal completion. Feasibi lity (session completion rates) and
acceptability (participant ratings of intervention ease and utility)
were assessed via descri ptive statistics, and pre-post improvements
in psychological, functional, and physical activity outcomes at 12
w e e k sw e r ee x a m i n e dv i am i x e de ﬀects regression models.
Results: Twelve midlife adults with low baseline physical activity
enrolled in the single-arm trial. Overall, 76.8% of all possible sessions
were completed by participants, and mean ratings of weekly phone
sessions were 8.9/10 (SD 1.6), exceeding our ap r i o r i thresholds for
feasibility and acceptability. Part icipants demonstrated generally
medium to large e ﬀect size magnitude improvements in
accelerometer-measured physical a ctivity, psychological outcomes,
and function.
Conclusions: An o v e l ,m i d l i f e - s p e c i ﬁc phone- and text-based PP-MI
intervention was feasible and had promising e ﬀects on physical
activity and other clinically relevant outcomes, supporting next-steptesting of this program via a randomized controlled trial.ARTICLE HISTORY

Midlife adults (age 45-64) represent over 25% of Americans and are the most rapidly
growing age group in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Midlife is a
crucial time period for the health of individuals, with many chronic conditions arisingduring this period, limiting function and leading to risk of additional serious conditions.For example, type 2 diabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, n.d) and
hypertension (Fryer, Ostchega, Hales, Zhang, & Kruszon-Moran, 2017) most commonly
arise during midlife, with the subsequent onset of heart disease immediately followingthis life stage (Virani et al., 2021).
Physical activity during midlife is associated with better overall health, lower rates of
heart disease, and reduced mortality (Kodama et al., 2013). Despite physical activity ’s
critical role in health, many midlife adults are unable to initiate or maintain rec-
ommended levels of physical activity. Indeed, despite the clear importance of physical
activity in promoting health and survival, fewer than 20% of midlife persons regularlyengage in adequate physical activity (Tucker, Welk, & Beyler, 2011).
There likely are several reasons for low engagement in physical activity in midlife. One
important contributor to low physical activity during this life phase is daily life stress,which can interfere with self-care e ﬀorts (Lachman, Teshale, & Agrigoroaei, 2015).
Many midlife adults experience competing demands related to greater job responsibil-
ities, caregiving of (younger and older) family members, and ﬁnancial stress (Lachman
et al., 2015). These elements can combine to greatly increase daily life stress and limit
their ability to manage their health (Lachman et al., 2015; Madva et al., 2018). Further-
more, overall levels of positive psychological well-being appear to reach a nadir in midlife
(Blanch ﬂower & Oswald, 2008). Finally, many midlife adults experience substantial time
pressure that can impede physical activity performance.
Motivational interviewing (MI), a counseling strategy designed to resolve ambivalence
and enhance motivation, (Miller & Rollnick, 2012) is a promising option to promote
physical activity in midlife persons. MI-based programs can be delivered remotely,which may increase their reach. However, MI-alone interventions have only led to
small improvements in health behavior adherence in medical populations (standardized
mean di ﬀerence = 0.19; O ’Halloran et al., 2014) suggesting that without additional com-
ponents this approach may be insu ﬃcient to improve longitudinal health and prevent the
onset of additional medical conditions in midlife.
Psychological well-being also may play an important role in physical activity and overall
health in midlife. Positive psychological well-being is prospectively linked to increased
physical activity and improved health outcomes, including reduced rates of heart disease
and lower overall mortality, independent of sociodemographic and medical factors(DuBois et al., 2015; Levine et al., 2021). Positive psychology (PP) interventions, which
involve the cultivation of positive psychological constructs through deliberate and systema-
tic exercises (e.g. acts of kindness, using personal strengths, recalling positive life events),Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005 consistently improve well-being (Bolier et al., 2013;
Carr et al., 2021; Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009). There have been few studies of PP-based inter-
ventions designed to boost well-being and physical activity, but PP-based interventions
have led to increased physical activity in medical settings in such projects, (Hu ﬀman
et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2012) potentially mediated through better mood, greater motiv-
ation and energy, increased perceived social support, and increased self-e ﬃcacy (Hu ﬀman,
DuBois, Millstein, Celano, & Wexler, 2015a
; Zambrano et al., 2020a ).292 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
Combining PP and MI could have powerful e ﬀects on physical activity in midlife
persons (see theoretical model Hu ﬀman et al., 2015a ,Figure 1 ). The MI component
could increase physical activity by resolving ambivalence, enhancing motivation, increas-
ing internal locus of control, and enhancing self-e ﬃcacy for exercise (Hawkins, 2010;
Hettema, Steele, & Miller, 2005; Lundahl et al., 2013). Furthermore, the PP component
could boost positive a ﬀect and reduce depression, both of which are linked to greater
physical activity (Levine et al., 2021; Zambrano et al., 2020a ). In addition, PP content
could increase engagement in MI. PP interventions increase optimism, outcome expect-ancy, and self-e ﬃcacy, (Lee, Robin Cohen, Edgar, Laizner, & Gagnon, 2006; Lyubomirsky
& Layous, 2013; Meevissen, Peters, & Alberts, 2011) along with perceived social support
(Fredrickson, 2001; Majer, Jason, & Olson, 2004). These factors have been linked to
greater e ﬀectiveness of MI and other behavioral interventions (Goossens, Vlaeyen,
Hidding, Kole-Snijders, & Evers, 2005; Scheier et al., 2007). Finally, midlife-speci ﬁc
stress reduction content added to the MI-based health behavior change program could
further promote health by directly addressing sources of stress identi ﬁed by midlife
persons as factors that can lead to lesser participation in health behaviors (Madva
et al., 2018). We chose this intervention, as opposed to other options, given that it speci ﬁ-
cally addresses numerous factors (low motivation, low well-being, numerous sources ofstress) that appear to impede midlife physical activity based on our literature review and
developmental work outlined below.
To be e ﬀective, such a physical activity program for midlife adults would need to be
eﬃcient and accessible, and it would need to address the barriers to physical activity com-
monly experienced by this population. Remotely delivered interventions reduce the time,
ﬁnancial, and transportation burdens of in-person programs, and both phone- and text
message-based programs have led to improvements in physical activity, (Hu ﬀman et al.,
2020;H uﬀman et al., 2021b ) with text messaging programs for physical activity having a
small-to-medium e ﬀect size (Cohen ’sd= .31-.38 Smith, Duque, Hu ﬀman, Healy, &
Celano, 2020), though the evidence for their impact is mixed (Nguyen, Gill, Wolpin,
Steele, & Benditt, 2009; Smith et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2015). Additionally, text messages
for physical activity appear to work best as part of multicomponent programs, rather
than alone, (Smith et al., 2020) and they can be used to reinforce principles that were pre-
viously introduced in more detail by phone or in writing.
Despite the importance of promoting physical activity and well-being in midlife to
improve health, assist in the management of existing medical conditions, and preventcardiovascular disease, there has been very limited study of interventions that are tailored
Figure 1. Theoretical model outlining potential mechanisms of intervention e ﬀects.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 293
to midlife persons or address speci ﬁc barriers to self-management (e.g. time pressure,
caregiving burden) common in this population. Furthermore, few programs have
focused on the promotion of psychological well-being in midlife, despite the fact thatPP exercises are simple to deliver and consistently enhance well-being constructs.
Accordingly, using information from qualitative interviews and a small phone-based
pilot study in midlife persons, (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021b ; Madva et al., 2018) we developed a
midlife-adapted, phone- and text-based intervention to promote physical activity in inac-tive midlife persons. The intervention combines elements of PP with MI and midlife-
speciﬁc stress reduction content. We then tested this 12-week program in a single-arm
proof-of-concept trial to examine its feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact. Wehypothesized that the intervention would surpass a priori benchmarks for feasibility
and acceptability, and would show small-to-medium e ﬀect size magnitude improvements
in psychological outcomes and accelerometer-measured physical activity.
Methods
Overview. This was a single-arm proof-of-concept trial examining the feasibility and pre-
liminary impact of a PP-MI intervention, delivered via phone and text messages, amonginactive midlife adults enrolled from the primary care practices a ﬃliated with an urban
academic medical center. Participants were enrolled between September and October
2020, and all participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by thehealth center ’s institutional review board prior to study initiation (IRB approval:
2020P001884). We aimed to enroll between 10 –12 participants over a two-month
period given the availability of research sta ﬀfor this unfunded feasibility trial and our
use of similar samples when examining initial proof of concept of behavioral interven-tions prior to next-step testing (Celano et al., 2019; Celano, Freedman, Beale, Gomez-
Bernal, & Hu ﬀman, 2018;H uﬀman et al., 2021b ).
Intervention development. The PP-MI intervention was developed utilizing the NIH
Stage model ’s conceptual framework of intervention development (Onken, Carroll,
Shoham, Cuthbert, & Riddle, 2014). Our prior developmental work (Gomez-Bernal
et al., 2019; Madva et al., 2018) had been Stage IA along this framework, with both a
prior proof-of-concept trial (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021b ) and the current trial representing
Stage IB intervention trials. More speci ﬁcally, our prior work included reviewing prior
literature on midlife interventions, (Gomez-Bernal et al., 2019) conducting qualitative
assessments examining midlife stressors and health behaviors, (Madva et al., 2018)
reviewing the literature on PP-based interventions, (Carr et al., 2021; Cohn, Pietrucha,
Saslow, Hult, & Moskowitz, 2014; Moskowitz et al., 2012) conducting analyses of prior
PP-based interventions to assess e ﬃcacy among midlife persons, (Feig et al., 2020) and
developing infrastructure for text message delivery (Legler, Celano, Beale, Hoeppner,
&H uﬀman, 2020). We chose to use MI given that it has been used to promote physical
activity in a very wide range of settings and populations, but added speci ﬁc content
around stress reduction (in Sessions 5 and 6) along with time management and managing
of potential caregiving, employment, or ﬁnancial barriers (in Session 4 and throughout,
with specialized content provided to participants as needed via an Appendix in the inter-ventionist manual) (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021b ; Kopf et al., 2014; Park et al., 2013a ). This work
was aimed to ensure that the MI-focused program had elements customized to the294 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
midlife population. This also included a prior proof-of-concept trial of a phone-only PP-
MI intervention for midlife persons that found the program to be feasible and well-
accepted (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021b ). We next chose to conduct a second proof-of-
concept trial of this PP-MI intervention –now utilizing a shorter duration of full
phone sessions and with the addition of adjunctive text messaging, in an attempt to
further optimize scalability. The framework utilizing the speci ﬁc PP activities, MI-
based physical activity program, and text messages was adapted from our prior interven-tion studies using a similar framework, (Hu ﬀman et al., 2020;H uﬀman, Feig, et al., 2019)
other PP-based studies in medical populations, (Cohn et al., 2014; Moskowitz et al., 2012;
Moskowitz et al., 2017) and the above developmental work to allow speci ﬁc adaptation to
the midlife population. Within these models, the main focus of the study was to assess
feasibility of recruitment, retention, study procedures, and the phone and text com-
ponents of the intervention (Gomez-Bernal et al., 2019).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. To be included, participants were required to be
midlife adults (age 45 –64 at enrollment) and to have low self-reported physical activity
(<150 min/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity [MVPA] over the priorweek, as assessed via the short-form version of the validated International PhysicalActivity Questionnaire [IPAQ] scale Booth et al., 2003). This version of the scale has
been associated with an overestimation of physical activity in some cases; (Lee, Macfar-
lane, Lam, & Stewart, 2011) given this, we felt that if participants self-reported low phys-
ical activity on this screening tool, it was rather likely that their true activity was quite
low. Furthermore, we utilized the IPAQ-SF, because both the long-form and shorter
form of the IPAQ have been validated and used in a wide variety of populations,(Craig et al., 2003; Sember et al., 2020) including patients at elevated cardiac risk,
(Pfaeﬄi, Maddison, Jiang, Dalleck, & Lof, 2013) because it is very brief and simple to
administer (and for participants to understand), and because it allows collection of phys-ical activity data regarding a wide range of activities, including those that may not bepicked up by accelerometer.
Exclusion criteria included: (a) a condition preventing MVPA completion (e.g. chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis); (b) no access to a telephone or text mes-saging; (c) inability to communicate in English; (d) cognitive impairment, as assessed via
a cognitive screen designed to assess appropriateness for research participation; (Calla-
han, Unverzagt, Hui, Perkins, & Hendrie, 2002) (e) ongoing participation in physical
activity or psychological programs (e.g. mind-body interventions); and (f) coronary
artery disease (CAD), de ﬁned as a prior acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction
or unstable angina) or coronary stenosis identi ﬁed through cardiac catheterization (i.e.
50% stenosis of the left main artery or 70% stenosis of another coronary artery). The
age, communication, and medical condition (e.g. CAD) criteria were assessed via both
the electronic record review and phone screen assessments; the remainder were assessedvia phone screens. We excluded persons with CAD because one eventual goal of theprogram is to prevent heart disease and because individuals with CAD may have
greater restrictions on moderate or vigorous activity.
Potential participants were identi ﬁed via IRB-approved searches of our medical
center ’s electronic medical record system for midlife persons receiving care in
aﬃliated primary care practices. Patients who had agreed to receive communications
about ongoing research studies were sent opt-out letters from the study team, andHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 295
those who did not opt out of contact completed a screening phone call. At the screening
call, study sta ﬀdescribed the project to potential participants and screened them for
study criteria (e.g. low physical activity). Interested and eligible patients were mailed astudy information fact sheet and were scheduled for a baseline phone study session,during which they provided informed consent and completed baseline self-report instru-
ments. Participants were then mailed an accelerometer for physical activity assessment,
wore it for one week, and then mailed it back to study sta ﬀ.
After con ﬁrming adequate accelerometer wear time (at least 4 days with 10 + hours of
wear time), a second study phone session was scheduled, and participants were mailed a
written treatment manual and pedometer. During this session, participants spoke with astudy interventionist, who introduced them to the treatment manual and pedometer,
reviewed the program ’s structure and rationale, and conducted an introductory
session. If the participant had inadequate wear time, the study team would havemailed the accelerometer back to the participant for further wear, and when it was
returned by mail a second time (and once adequate wear time was con ﬁrmed), the
second phone session would have been completed (this was not required in this study,as all participants had adequate time on the ﬁrst wearing).
The balance of the intervention was delivered by phone and text messages, with
weekly phone contacts for 12 weeks (6 weeks of 30-minute phone sessions followed by
6 weeks of briefer [5-minute] phone check-ins) and ongoing weekly text messagingover the 12 weeks. Following the intervention, participants completed a follow-up assess-
ment and received accelerometers by mail, wore them for 1 week, then returned them by
mail.
Intervention .Over the ﬁrst 6 weeks of the program (7 sessions over 6 weeks, including
the introductory session) ,participants completed assigned intervention activities (e.g. PP
exercises and physical activity goals) on their own, then participated in 30-minute weeklyphone sessions with a study psychologist interventionist. The intervention consisted of aPP component that focused on the development of skills to promote psychological well-
being in daily life, along with an MI component that utilized MI concepts and speci ﬁc
goal-setting strategies to increase engagement in physical activity. During the calls, theparticipant and interventionist reviewed the prior week ’s activities, discussed the use
of well-being skills, reviewed facilitators and barriers to physical activity, and discussed
the assigned activities and rationale for the upcoming week (see Tables 1 and 2for
additional intervention detail, along with Appendix for full treatment manual).
Phone sessions in the ﬁrst 6 weeks. The PP program contained speci ﬁc activities (see
Table 1 and next paragraph below), selected via review of e ﬀective PP activities in
prior research (Seligman et al., 2005; Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009) and our qualitative
work focused on well-being in midlife persons (Madva et al., 2018). The framework
for sessions —reviewing prior weeks ’activities from the treatment manual, considering
skill application, and introducing the subsequent activity —was based on the frameworks
used in our prior projects and other PP-based interventions in medical settings (Mosko-
witz et al., 2012; Moskowitz et al., 2017). This component was speci ﬁcally customized for
midlife adults, based on our review of midlife physical activity literature (Spiteri et al.,2019; Zou et al., 2021) and a prior midlife study conducted by our team, (Hu ﬀman
et al., 2021b ) by providing potentially relevant examples and context (e.g. juggling
numerous responsibilities, caring for family) and selecting activities that seemed most296 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
speciﬁc to midlife (e.g. the activity on meaningful activities was selected because many
midlife persons begin to focus on meaning, purpose, and legacy more distinctly
during this life phase Lachman, 2004). Participants completed speci ﬁc activities outlined
in the treatment manual each week and wrote about the activity and its e ﬀects in the
manual.
During the PP portion ( ∼10 min) of phone sessions during the ﬁrst 6 weeks of the
program, participants and interventionists reviewed the prior week ’s activity, discussed
how skills from that activity could be utilized in daily life, and discussed the rationale
for the next week ’s PP activity. The PP exercises were as follows : gratitude for positive
events (Session 1), expressing gratitude (Session 2), recalling past success (Session 3),
using personal strengths (Session 4), enjoyable and meaningful activities (Session 5), ima-
gining the ‘good life ’(Session 6) and, planning for the future (Session 7; focused on trans-
lating skills to daily life). Further details for each activity and sample pages from themanual are in Table 1 andFigure 2 , respectively, with the full treatment manual included
as an Appendix.Table 1. Initial PP-MI phone intervention content (7 phone sessions over 6 weeks)

7 Skills application + future planning
Participants make a plan for continuing to usetheir PP-based skills in the future.Reviewing progress/considering the future
Trainers assist participants with reviewing theiraccomplishments and help them to create a plan for
physical activity for the near future.
Each week, as part of the MI-informed behavior change portion of the program, prior to reviewing the speci ﬁc weekly
topics noted above, interventionists reviewed progress on the prior week ’s activity goal, discussed intra-activity positive
a
ﬀect, used the 5A ’s approach, tracked activity, and problem-solved cognitive or instrumental barriers to activity.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 297
The midlife-adapted MI portion ( ∼15 mins) of phone sessions in the ﬁrst 6 weeks
assessed motivation to engage in physical activity, discussed barriers to activity, and setphysical activity goals or used MI tools to boost motivation, depending on the partici-
pant’s stage of change. This component also included a brief stress reduction module
based on feedback in our prior work in midlife adults (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021b ; Madva
et al., 2018). Each week, the ‘5A’s’(Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) practice fra-
mework was utilized, and at each session interventionists and participants reviewed the
prior week ’s physical activity goal, assessed stage of change, and problem-solved bar-
riers to being active. Each week, a distinct topic (e.g. tracking physical activity, usingresources to facilitate activity) was also discussed with participants (see Table 1 ).
The phone session ended with the setting of a concrete physical activity goal for the
following week.
The initial four sessions of the MI component introduced speci ﬁc MI-based concepts
and skills for boosting physical activity, including a focus on participants ’assignment of
importance and con ﬁdence in changing their activity level, means of tracking activity,Table 2. One-way text messages (weeks 1-6).
Session Session Topic Component Message
1 Gratitude for Positive Events PP One way to increase gratitude is to deliberately take note of
small positive things that happen. This week, think about andwrite down three good things that happened!
1 Moving for Better Health MI Keeping track of your physical activity can be very helpful to
maintain motivation. Try using a notebook, spreadsheet,
smartphone app, or whatever works best for you!
2 Expressing Gratitude PP Almost half of your happiness is under your control. This week,
write a thank you letter for something someone did for you. It
can lift your spirits (and theirs)!
2 SMART goals MI Setting reachable goals can be really helpful in establishing a
new routine. Try setting a new exercise goal today that is do-able based on your ﬁtness level.
3 Remembering past success PP Remembering your past successes is not always easy but can
increase happiness. This week, remind yourself of yourstrengths by visualizing a past success!
3 Barriers MI Barriers, such as a lack of time, can make it hard to reach your
goals. If you struggle to ﬁnd enough time to be active, try
spreading your activity throughout the day.
4 Using strengths PP This week, focus on one of your strengths and use it in a new
way. Pick an activity you might not usually do and use your
strength to make it happen. It can feel great!
4 Resources MI Resources like family, parks, walking trails, and even comfortable
clothes and shoes can help you be active. This week, use yourresources to reach your activity goals!
5 Enjoyable and meaningful
activitiesPP A great way to boost your mood is to engage in fun or
meaningful activities. This week, set aside 15 min for yourselfto do something enjoyable or meaningful!
5 Stress reduction (problem-
focused coping)MI Sources of stress can get in the way of being active. This week,
use problem-solving strategies to reduce stress and meet your
physical activity goal!
6 The Good Life PP This week, spend some time thinking about what a ‘good life ’
would look like for you. Then, think about what you can do this
week to start to make this life a reality!
6 Stress reduction (emotion-
focused coping)MI Emotion-focused coping strategies, like deep breathing or
visualization, can help reduce stress and put you in the rightframe of mind for exercise. Try them this week!
7 Conclusion Conclusion Thank you again for participating in MASTERY. Your trainer will
continue to communicate using text messages to help youmeet your goals moving forward!298 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
and utilizing the ‘SMART ’(speciﬁc, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based)
framework (Doran, 1981) for setting and reaching goals. The next two sessions utilized
a stress reduction module customized to midlife, adapted from established stress
reduction programs and our prior work with midlife persons (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021b ;
Kopf et al., 2014; Park et al., 2013a ). The ﬁnal session (Session 7), in parallel with the
Figure 2. Pages from the PP-MI treatment manual.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 299
PP component, reviewed program content and progress and helped participants to set
speciﬁc, realistic goals for physical activity.
Phone check-ins in the ﬁnal 6 weeks. The phone check-ins ( ∼5 min) in the ﬁnal 6 weeks
of the program were structured calls with participants that focused on goals for PP skilluse and physical activity completion that were created at the ﬁnal phone session (Session
7) and via weekly text messaging (see below). The calls, performed between the goal-
focused text messaging that occurred each week in the ﬁnal 6 weeks of the program,
reviewed participant PP and activity goals, checked in about progress, reviewed facilita-
tors and barriers to completion, and modi ﬁed goals if needed. Interventionists also
inquired about speci ﬁc sources of stress common in midlife (e.g. occupational, caregiv-
ing, and ﬁnancial stress) and referred participants to resources and strategies in the
Appendix of their treatment manual, when relevant.
Text messaging. Text messaging was utilized to supplement the phone sessions and
written treatment manual content. In the ﬁrst 6 weeks of the program, one-way messages
were sent to participants that reinforced content from the phone sessions and treatment
manual. For example, following Session 1 (which focused on recalling positive life eventsin the PP component and tracking physical activity in the MI component), the text mess-ages sent to participants were:
(PP message) One way to increase gratitude is to deliberately take note of small positive things
that happen. This week, think about and write down three good things that happened!
(MI message) Barriers, such as a lack of time, can make it hard to reach your goals. If you
struggle to ﬁnd enough time to be active, try spreading your activity throughout the day.
The messages were sent utilizing an IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant approach uti-
lizing messages selected from our Amazon Web Services DynamoDB message database
(Amazon Web Services, 2020) and deployed via the Twilio (Twilio, 2021) program that
sends messages via a centralized phone number, rather than an individual cell phone.
We have utilized these platforms and this approach in prior text message intervention
studies (Legler et al., 2018; Legler et al., 2020). See Table 2 for further examples of text
messages.
In the ﬁnal six weeks of the program, participants completed brief two-way text
message sessions with study interventionists. These sessions, performed between theweekly goal-focused phone check-ins, allowed participants to review progress towardstheir PP and activity goals for the week, discuss any challenges completing the goals
with the interventionist, and modify their goals if needed. These messages were sent
by the participant ’s assigned study interventionist from a study-speci ﬁc phone number
via Twilio in a HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved manner.
Behavior change techniques. Overall, using the framework of Michie and colleagues,
(Michie et al., 2013) this physical activity program utilized the following behavior
change techniques: self-monitoring of behavior, review of outcome goal, discrepancy
with current behavior, problem-solving/coping planning, review of behavior goals, and
goal-setting, making this intervention more than a simple MI intervention but insteadan MI-informed physical activity behavioral intervention. Furthermore, the textmessage component of the intervention, given the nature of this modality, was largely
focused on providing direct education, facilitating goal setting, and providing more300 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
direct advice than would be utilized in a traditional MI intervention, making this com-
ponent a broader behavioral change intervention.
Intervention delivery and ﬁdelity. Interventionists were four psychologists (three of
whom were board-certi ﬁed, while the other was a research psychologist) who received
training in both the PP and MI components of the intervention from the lead study inter-
vention supervisor (CC), based on a protocol from our prior work (Hu ﬀman et al., 2020;
Huﬀman, Feig, et al., 2019; Zambrano et al., 2020a ). Training consisted of didactic ses-
sions, provision of written materials (including a written annotated training manual con-
taining guidelines and tips for each session), and role-playing sessions, which were based
on similar training programs run by our behavioral intervention collaborators (Parket al., 2006; Park et al., 2013b ). Throughout the trial, interventionists attended weekly
hour-long intervention supervisory meetings with this supervisor experienced in the
delivery of PP and MI interventions to review cases and assess ﬁdelity to the study inter-
vention. Sessions were audiotaped, and supervision sessions included a review of por-
tions of the audiotaped sessions. A study-created ﬁdelity scale was utilized to assess
ﬁdelity in the cases reviewed at the session, and feedback was provided to the interven-
tionists. We aimed to conform to best practices in behavioral intervention treatmentﬁdelity as outlined by the NIH Change Consortium checklist (Borrelli et al., 2005)
related to study design, provider training, treatment delivery, treatment receipt, and
enactment of treatment skills; we did not formally record number of minutes persession (though reviewed time during supervision meetings), and did not formally
develop an assessment of participants ’ability to perform the related skills, though this
was a major focus of the supervisory meetings, and we adhered to the other recommen-dations in the checklist.
Overall, if implemented, the program would require a clinician to deliver the interven-
tion (we have utilized bachelor ’s level-clinicians, social workers, nurses, and psycholo-
gists for PP-based programs in prior work), a written treatment manual, theinfrastructure for sending text messages, and adequate time for conducting the weekly
initial sessions ( ∼25 min) in the ﬁrst 6 weeks and briefer phone and text check-ins
(∼5 min each) in the next 6 weeks, along with additional time to account for missed
calls and documentation.
Study assessments and outcomes. Participants ’baseline sociodemographic and
medical characteristics were obtained via patient report and medical record review.For measures of feasibility and acceptability, session completion and participant
ratings of sessions were recorded by study interventionists. Finally, participants com-
pleted self-report measures at baseline and 12 weeks via telephone and wore acceler-ometers at both time points for objective physical activity outcomes.
Primary study outcomes: feasibility and acceptability. We measured feasibility via
rates of phone session completion (both full phone session and phone check-in; full com-
pletion required attending the phone call, completion of the prior week ’s planned PP
activity/skill, and setting a new physical activity goal). The two primary feasibility
measures were: (a) the proportion of all possible sessions that were completed across
all participants, and (b) the number of participants completing a majority of phone ses-sions. We chose these to assess the overall scope of session completion and to have a
clinically relevant metric, as we deemed that completing a majority of phone sessions
would convey the key elements of intervention content to the participant; we haveHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 301
used these metrics in prior feasibility studies of behavioral interventions (Celano et al.,
2019;H uﬀman et al., 2015b ). We measured acceptability via participant ratings of
phone session ease and utility (0-10 Likert scale, 0 = not easy/useful, 10 = very easy/
useful) of both the PP and MI activities/content each week during intervention callsover the initial 7 phone sessions, for a total of 4 weekly ratings.
We also collected secondary measures of acceptability via self-report assessments at 12
weeks regarding the utility of each study component (phone sessions, phone check-ins,one-way text messages, and two-way text sessions; 0 –10 Likert scales).
Secondary study outcomes: Accelerometer-measured physical activity and self-report
measures. This initial proof-of-concept study was not designed (and is not appropriate)to assess intervention e ﬃcacy given the small sample and lack of control condition, and
for this reason the outcomes noted below are exploratory. We assessed physical activity
(mean minutes of MVPA andtotal steps per day, with MVPA serving as the main second-
ary outcome measure) via the well-validated Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer (Aadland
& Ylvisaker, 2015). MVPA, measured by accelerometer, was chosen as the main second-
ary outcome because it is the intensity of activity most clearly and strongly associatedwith lower cardiovascular risk and overall improved health outcomes (Colberg et al.,2016; Full et al., 2021; Kraus et al., 2019; Stamatakis et al., 2019). We required valid accel-
erometer data from at least 10 h per day for at least 4 days as per prior studies using these
devices and a study of the device compared to doubly labeled water (Helgadottir, Forsell,& Ekblom, 2015;H uﬀman et al., 2020). We did not include one weekend day of activity,
given that we expected that not all participants (or midlife persons) would working, or
that some would not be working traditional daytime weekday positions. For MVPA,we utilized a threshold of 1952 counts/minute as per prior work (Cain, Conway,
Adams, Husak, & Sallis, 2013).
For self-report outcomes, we assessed positive a ﬀectusing the positive a ﬀect items
from the Positive and Negative A ﬀect Schedule (PANAS; Crawford & Henry, 2004)opti-
mism using the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) scale, (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges,
1994) and anxiety and depression via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
(Bjelland, Dahl, Haug, & Neckelmann, 2002). As potential mediators of the e ﬀect of PP
content on physical activity, we assessed internal locus of control via the Multidimen-
sional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) scale, (Wallston, 2005) perceived social
support via the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet,Powell, Farley, Werkman, & Berko ﬀ,1990) and physical activity self-e ﬃcacy via the
Self-Eﬃcacy for Exercise (SEE) measure (van der Heijden, Pouwer, & Pop, 2013). We
assessed physical function using the PROMIS 20-item physical function (PF-20) scale,
(Jensen et al., 2015
) and we measured health-related quality of life (HRQoL) via the
Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12) scale (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller,
1996). Finally, we also assessed self-reported health behaviors , including physical activity
via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (Lee et al., 2011) and overall
adherence to healthy diet, physical activity, and medications using items from the Medical
Outcomes Study Speci ﬁc Adherence Scale (MOS SAS) (DiMatteo, Hays, & Sherbourne,
1992).
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics (proportions and means/SD) were used to
report session completion rates and ease/utility scores. As a threshold for feasibility,
based on our prior work. (Hu ﬀman, Feig, et al., 2019;H uﬀman et al., 2020)w e302 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
utilized a priori metrics of 70% completion of phone sessions/check-ins across all par-
ticipants and more than half of participants completing a majority of the 12 phone
sessions. For our primary measures of acceptability regarding the phone sessionease and utility, we calculated mean ease and utility ratings of each session component(i.e. PP and MI) across all participants and utilized mean scores of greater than 7.0 as
oura priori threshold for acceptability, based on prior work using similar ratings for
acceptability of behavioral interventions (Hu ﬀman, Feig, et al., 2019;H uﬀman et al.,
2020). We also utilized this cuto ﬀfor our secondary measures of acceptability
measured at 12 weeks with more global assessments of the utility of the phone ses-
sions, phone check-ins, one-way texts, and two-way texts.
For pre-post changes in physical activity and self-report outcomes, we used mixed
eﬀects regression models, with a categorical e ﬀect of time ; these models allow inclusion
of all participants, even those with missing data, in an intent-to-treat model. No covari-ates were used in the model for this initial feasibility study. For these pre-post analyses,
we focused primarily on the e ﬀect size (ES) of the change in the measure, calculated as the
coeﬃcient from the mixed model divided by the SD of the residual for the measure,
rather than statistical signi ﬁcance, given the secondary nature of these outcomes in
this small sample. In a further set of analyses, we examined correlations between
number of sessions completed and change in the secondary outcomes (e.g. MVPA, posi-
tive aﬀect). All analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp; College
Station, TX).
Results
We contacted 43 patients, and after hearing about the study and undergoing relevant
screening, 19 were interested in participating. Seven screened out, and a total of 12 par-
ticipants enrolled in the proof-of concept trial (see study ﬂow diagram, Figure 3 for more
detail). Of these 12 participants, 11 provided feasibility data, and 9 provided all follow-up
data. The mean age of participants was 56.1 (SD 5.8) years, 9 (75%) were women, and 8
(67%) were non-Latino White persons; Table 3 displays all participant baseline sociode-
mographic and medical characteristics. Participants at baseline had a mean of 105 min ofMVPA/week as measured by accelerometer. Those who did not follow up (n = 3; all
women, mean age 56.0) were very similar in baseline characteristics to those who
remained in the study. They also had slightly lower (mean MVPA/week = 100 min) base-line MVPA compared to the overall sample (105 min). Fidelity was high across all inter-
ventionists as rated at supervision meetings.
Regarding feasibility, participants (including immediate dropouts) completed a mean
of 9.4 (SD 4.8) sessions (113/144 possible total sessions [78.4%] completed), with 9 (75%)
participants completing more than half of all possible sessions (i.e. 7 + out of 12). For
acceptability, participants ’mean ratings of PP-MI phone session ease and utility
ranged from 7.9-9.2 out of 10, with all components exceeding our a priori acceptability
threshold (PP ease = 7.9 [SD 2.4], PP utility = 9.2 [SD 1.6], MI ease = 9.2 [SD 1.4], MI
utility = 9.2 [SD 1.4]).
On additional measures of acceptability obtained at the 12-week follow-up, partici-
pants rated the overall utility of full phone sessions ( ﬁrst 6 weeks) 9.0/10 (SD 1.4),HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 303
phone coaching check-ins ( ﬁnal 6 weeks) 8.4/10 (SD 2.8), one-way text messages ( ﬁrst 6
weeks) 6.6/10 (SD 3.7), and check-in texts ( ﬁnal 6 weeks): 9.3/10 (SD 1.2).
Regarding the secondary study pre-post outcomes ( Tables 4 and 5), participants
reported increases in both self-reported and accelerometer-measured physical activity
over time. On the main secondary outcome of accelerometer-measured MVPA, partici-pants demonstrated medium magnitude ES improvements (mean increase of 7.2 min[residual SD 11.6] per day; p= .19; ES = .62). Participants also had a small ES magnitude
improvement on accelerometer-measured steps per day (mean increase of 431 [SD 1886]
steps per day); p= .64; ES = .23. On self-reported physical activity measured via theFigure 3. CONSORT Study Flow Diagram304 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
IPAQ, participants had a large ES improvement in activity (mean 2611 MET-minute
improvement [SD 1130], p< .001; ES = 2.31).
Participants also had medium to large ES magnitude improvements (ES = .57-1.49;
Table 4 ) on psychological metrics, including positive a ﬀect, optimism, depression, and
anxiety, with similar improvements in psychological factors that could mediate physical
activity change (self-e ﬃcacy for exercise, internal locus of control; ES = .79-1.94), though
no bene ﬁcial eﬀect on perceived social support and somewhat more mixed e ﬀects on
function and HRQoL ( Table 4 ). There was a very large improvement in self-reported
adherence to diet, activity, and medications via the MOS SAS (mean improvement4.16 (SD 1.48); p< .001; ES = 2.81).
On examination of the relationship between number of sessions completed and
secondary e ﬃcacy outcome measures ( Table 6 ), we in general found that completing
a greater number of sessions was associated with greater improvements in outcomes.For example, there were small-medium correlations between number of sessions com-
pleted and improvements in MVPA (r = .30) and number of steps taken (r = .46); the
greatest correlations were between session completion and self-e ﬃcacy for exercise (r
= .50) and overall self-reported adherence to health behaviors (r = .68), though none
of these correlations were statistically signi ﬁcant. In contrast, there were negative cor-
relations between number of sessions completed and some secondary outcomes,Table 3. Participant characteristics.

Discussion
In this initial trial, we found that a phone- and text-delivered, midlife-speci ﬁc interven-
tion to promote physical activity was feasible, well-accepted, and generally associated
with medium-to-large ES magnitude improvements in accelerometer-measured MVPAand other clinically relevant outcomes. Regarding our primary aims of feasibility and
acceptability, approximately 78% of all possible phone sessions were fully completed,
and three-quarters of participants completed 7 or more of the 12 phone sessions. Like-wise, ratings of the ease and utility of both the PP and MI components of the phone ses-sions had mean scores ranging from 7.9-9.2/10; these outcomes surpassed our a priori
thresholds in all cases. On additional measures of acceptability obtained at the 12-
week follow-up, participants rated highly the overall utility of full phone sessions,phone coaching check-ins, and check-in texts, but gave lower ratings for the one-way
text messages; this relatively low rating for one-way text messages did not meet our a
priori threshold for acceptability of 7.0/10.
Such results regarding session completion and intervention acceptability are consist-
ent with previous studies of phone-based PP-MI interventions among midlife persons
and those with medical illness (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021a ;H uﬀman, Feig, et al., 2019;
Huﬀman et al., 2020). This trial extends prior work, as it represents only the second
study to our knowledge that has used this PP-based approach speci ﬁcally in midlife
persons (Hu ﬀman et al., 2021b ). The prior study was a single-arm study in 11 partici-
pants examining a PP and MI-based approach to physical activity. The experimentalintervention utilized similar content and outcome measures, but was more intensive,Table 6. Relationships between number of intervention sessions completed and improvements in
secondary outcome measures.

as it utilized 12 weeks of phone sessions from psychologists. That study had somewhat
larger e ﬀects on MVPA ( d= .87 vs. d= .62 in this project) and similar but slightly
higher scores on measures of feasibility and acceptability. This project extends thatprior work, as it includes half the number of full phone sessions and is the ﬁrst to
utilize text messaging as an accessible means to provide additional support and
content beyond the 6-week phone session period. Such work directly addresses the
public health problem of low physical activity among the growing population ofmidlife persons, who are at risk for developing numerous chronic medical conditions
during this life stage. This remote intervention approach might be particularly well-
suited to this population, as in-person interventions are likely suboptimal given thatmany midlife adults must manage multiple competing demands and experience substan-
tial time pressure, and requiring fewer full ( ∼25 min) phone sessions may be bene ﬁcial in
terms of patient and provider burden. A prior, non-PP based, intervention for persons inmidlife was e ﬀective in the short-term but not long-term, and it used in-person individ-
ual or group sessions, which may be less feasible (Ribeiro, Martins, & Carvalho, 2014).
The intervention studied in this trial may thus have some distinct bene ﬁts from the
above-noted prior work, though substantially more research on the program must beconducted before any such conclusions could be made.
Along with meeting benchmarks for feasibility and acceptability, the intervention was
associated with improvements in physical activity, including MVPA, among this cohortof midlife adults with low physical activity. Physical activity, especially MVPA, is strongly
linked with lower rates of cardiac disease, other chronic medical conditions, and mor-
tality (Saint-Maurice et al., 2019). Likewise, participants showed substantial improve-
ments in psychological factors such as positive a ﬀect and depression during the
intervention. Improvements in these domains have the potential to improve quality of
life, promote greater engagement in physical activity, and boost overall health, giventhe literature prospectively connecting improvements in these factors with greater par-ticipation in physical activity and superior health outcomes (Levine et al., 2021; Zam-
brano et al., 2020b ). Indeed, in this study, participants moved from being a mean of
45 min below recommended weekly MVPA completion of 150 min per week (105min/week at baseline on accelerometer) to exceeding this benchmark (mean of approxi-
mately 155 min/week, based on improvement by 7.2 min per day) by study end.
Several ﬁndings were notable. Though three-quarters of participants completed a
majority of sessions, a small number dropped out shortly after enrollment, suggesting
that simpler or shorter procedures, especially at the outset of the study, might improve
initial engagement. While participants rated most intervention components highly, onsecondary acceptability analyses, participants rated the utility of the one-way text mess-
ages in the ﬁrst 6 weeks as somewhat lower than the subsequent two-way messages,
suggesting that some form of live or automated interactivity may be an importantaspect of text messaging in such an intervention. It may also be the case that the two-way messages were well-received in the context of an existing connection with the inter-
ventionist via the phone sessions and that such messaging, without such prior contact/
familiarity, would be less well-accepted. Indeed, the literature on text message interven-tions does suggest that brief interactive phone or text-based contact or coaching with an
interventionist as part of such interventions may substantially boost impact (Godino
et al., 2016; Godino et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020). In terms of mediating variables,308 J. C. HUFFMAN ET AL.
internal constructs such as locus of control and self-e ﬃcacy, but not externally-focused
perception of social support, improved during the intervention, suggesting that these
may be factors that helped participants to become more physically active. Of these vari-ables, self-e ﬃcacy may be particularly important, given the literature suggesting that self-
eﬃcacy for exercise is a major contributor to engaging in (and increasing) physical
activity, and future studies should examine the mediating e ﬀects of this variable
(Bauman et al., 2012; Locke, McMahon, & Brawley, 2020).
Scalability is a key issue for an intervention such as this one that is targeted at a major
public health problem in a broad population of busy adults with multiple stressors. While
we were not able to obtain information on those who declined participation, those par-ticipants who dropped out were largely similar to those who remained in the study. Fur-
thermore, such an intervention may be more challenging for those with busy daytime
work schedules plus family commitments (e.g. working parents) in terms of completionof phone sessions, while text messaging may be less familiar to some who use this
modality less, including some adults on the older spectrum of midlife. Other factors
that could contribute to participation and engagement in the program —either as a
research project or in clinical implementation —could include current levels of motiv-
ation to change behavior, self-e ﬃcacy to change physical activity, and ﬁnancial and
time-related factors, all of which need to be assessed in future projects.
Finally, while there were small to medium improvements in accelerometer-measured
physical activity, there were much larger improvements in self-reported activity and
overall adherence. This could suggest that the accelerometers may not have picked up
all forms of activity completed by participants (e.g. swimming), or instead that partici-pants may have overestimated their improvements in these self-care domains. Indeed,
there is substantial research examining di ﬀerences in self-reported physical activity
and objectively measured activity, with self-reported physical activity appearing to beoverestimated in most cases (Ainsworth, Cahalin, Buman, & Ross, 2015). (Sallis &
Saelens, 2000) The self-report measure used in this study, the short form of the IPAQ,
has been speci ﬁcally associated with overestimation of the amount of physical activity
reported compared with objective measures (Lee et al., 2011; Rzewnicki, Vanden
Auweele, & De Bourdeaudhuij, 2003). While this measure has been found to be reliable
within participants, (Lee et al., 2011) and baseline activity as well as follow-up activity
may have been overreported, this prior work suggests that the accelerometer-measuredphysical activity change seems much more likely to represent an accurate estimation
of the e ﬀects of the intervention on this outcome.
This single-arm proof-of-concept trial had numerous limitations. For example, it uti-
lized a small sample derived from a single urban academic medical center, study out-
comes were assessed over only 12 weeks, and there was no control condition.
Participant self-report instruments were administered by phone, which can lead to par-ticipants responses ’being a ﬀected by socially desirable responding or experimental
demand. Likewise, the self-report physical activity measure used, as noted, has been
associated with overestimation of physical activity, though this would presumably be
true at both baseline and follow-up assessments. The e ﬀect size estimates obtained for
changes in MVPA and other outcomes are highly speculative given the very small
(and uncontrolled) sample in this proof of concept trial and should not be used to
power future studies of this intervention. Longer, larger, well-controlled studies of theHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 309
intervention are required to identify the clinical e ﬀectiveness of the program in front-line
clinical settings.
In conclusion, in this proof-of-concept trial of a phone and text message PP-MI
program adapted for inactive midlife adults, we found that the intervention was feasible,acceptable, and associated with improvements in MVPA and other clinically relevant
measures. Further studies of the intervention are required to more de ﬁnitively test the
impact of this program, conduct rigorous analyses of mechanism and mediation of inter-vention e ﬀects to better understand how the program can work, and utilize implemen-
tation analyses that would be needed to estimate the scalability of the program.
