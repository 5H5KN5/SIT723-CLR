Abstract
Objective— HIV has a profound impact on infected individuals and their families. This study 
evaluated the efficacy of an intervention aimed at improving the mental health of people living 
with HIV (PLH) and their family members.
Methods— A randomized controlled trial of 475 PLH and 522 family members was conducted in 
Anhui, China. The intervention comprised of activities at individual-, family-, and community- 
levels. The study outcomes, which included depressive symptoms and coping with illness for the 
PLH and depressive symptoms and caregiver burden for the family members, were assessed at 
baseline and at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-up. We used a mixed-effects regression model 
with village- and participant-level random effects to assess the intervention effect on the 
improvement of outcome measures.
Results— Relative to the control condition, the PLH and family members of the intervention 
group reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. The largest difference in depressive 
symptoms was observed at the 6-month for the PLH and at the 12-month for family members. 
Decreases in perceived caregiver burden over time were observed for family members in both 
conditions; however, the group difference did not reach statistical significance. Significant 
intervention effect on the coping with illness was reported by the PLH.
Conclusions— The study highlights the importance of empowering families affected by HIV to 
confront the challenges together rather than individually. It may be optimal for future programs to 
include both PLH and their family members to maximize intervention effects through 
strengthening interactions and support within a family.

Introduction
HIV has a profound impact on the mental health status of infected individuals and their 
families. Various studies have documented that people living with HIV (PLH) are more 
likely to develop mental health disorders, such as depression, compared with the general 
population ( Chibanda, Benjamin, Weiss, & Abas, 2014 ; Lyons, Pitts, & Grierson, 2012 ). 
Depression is consistently found to be associated with non-adherence to HIV treatment 
(Gonzalez, Batchelder, Psaros, & Safren, 2011 ; Uthman, Magidson, Safren, & Nachega, 
2014 ), and mental health challenges may accelerate HIV disease progression and lead to 
earlier mortality and increased HIV-specific morbidity ( Chida & Vedhara, 2009 ; Leserman, 
2008 ).
Literature has suggested that HIV disrupts the family structure and places stress on the entire 
family ( Dejman et al., 2015 ; Li et al., 2012 ). Since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART), HIV infection has become a lifelong chronic disease ( Deeks, Lewin, & Havlir, 
2013 ). As with other chronic illness, partners and families often take on the role of informal 
caregivers and perform a variety of roles that help PLH to adhere to treatment regimens, 
avoid unnecessary hospital admissions, and provide physical and emotional support ( Okeke, 
2016 ). The caregiving tasks can place a great strain on them and lead to individual stress and 
tensions between the members of the families ( Vitaliano, Zhang, & Scanlan, 2003 ; Pinquart 
& Sorensen, 2003 ).
Additionally, HIV-affected families may become burdened not only by caregiving but also 
by social barriers attached to HIV infection, which are particularly true in family-oriented 
countries, such as China ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). A study conducted in China showed that HIV 
brings shame to the whole family, damaging within family relations and the broader family 
social networks ( Li et al., 2008 ). Both PLH and members of their families face fear of 
disclosure ( Qiao, Li, Zhou, Shen, & Teng, 2016 ), financial uncertainty ( Ama & Seloilwe, 
2010 ), stigma and discrimination ( Zhang et al., 2016 ), and social isolation ( Kipp, 
Tindyebwa, Karamagi, & Rubaale, 2007 ; Zhang, Zhang, Hanko, & Fuller-Thomson, 2011 ). 
These psychosocial challenges may aggravate mental health issues among PLH and their 
family members. To minimize the psychological, physical, and social impact of HIV , 
program developers and researchers have increasingly recognized the important role played 
by family in reducing the vulnerability and coping with the devastating effects of the disease 
(Kuo et al., 2016 ; Rotheram-Borus et al., 2012 ). Some interventions have aimed to improve 
mental health functions of PLH and family members using family-based ( Li et al., 2012 ), 
cognitive behavioral therapy-based ( Carrico et al., 2009 ), and community-based approaches 
(Wu & Li, 2013 ).
The intervention described in this study, entitled Together for Empowerment Activities 
(TEA), was designed, developed, and implemented to target PLH and their family members’ 
specific needs at individual, family, and community levels. The TEA intervention was Li et al. Page 2

guided by the Social Action Theory ( Ewart, 1991 ), which emphasizes social 
interdependence and its link to personal health. The intervention was piloted with promising 
outcomes ( Li et al., 2011 ). Based on the pilot, a full scale randomized controlled trial was 
conducted between late 2011 and early 2016 to evaluate its efficacy to improve 
psychological wellbeing for both PLH and family members.
Methods
Study Design
The TEA intervention trial utilized a cluster-randomized controlled design with two arms. 
The study was conducted in Anhui providence, China, where many PLH were infected via 
commercial plasma donations, and HIV-affected families reside in poor rural areas ( Ji, 
Detels, Wu, & Yin, 2006 ; Wu, Rou, Detels, 2001 ). A total of 475 HIV-affected families were 
recruited from 32 villages. The 32 villages were selected because they have the largest 
numbers of HIV-affected families in the study area as reported by the office of the Anhui 
Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). After baseline assessment, the 
32 villages were randomized into either an intervention condition or a control condition. We 
assessed the geographic information between the intervention and control villages to ensure 
that the distance between the villages was far enough to avoid potential contamination. The 
intervention and control villages were at least 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles) apart and 
separated by hills or ranges. The intervention effects were evaluated at baseline and at 6-, 
12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-ups. The study protocol was approved by the institutional 
review boards at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Anhui Provincial CDC. 
This trial was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov  protocol registration system 
(NCT01762553).
The Intervention
For villages in the intervention condition, the TEA intervention activities were delivered to 
target HIV-related challenges at these three critical levels: 1) at the individual  level, TEA 
Gathering – six separate intervention sessions were conducted for PLH and their family 
members to deal with their specific HIV-related challenges. The sessions were conducted 
with approximately 10–12 participants in a group. Interactive group activities, such as 
games, pair-share, role plays, and discussions, were delivered to establish healthy daily 
routine, improve physical and mental health, improve family and parent-child relationships, 
and encourage community integration; 2) at the family  level, TEA Time – six types of 
family activities were conducted at home after each TEA Gathering session. The family 
activities involved all members to strengthen family interaction and support. For example, 
“Fabric of Family” was an activity in which supplies were given to each family to make their 
own family carrying bag or blanket. The designs should represent things that were important 
to the family. The products were then shared with others during the next TEA Gathering 
session; and 3) at the community  level, TEA Garden – three community events consisting of 
a health fair, an amusing sports event, and a family talent show were organized by both 
intervention participants and community leaders to enhance community and social 
integration. These initial intervention activities took place between six and eight weeks.Li et al. Page 3

To maintain the intervention effect, reunions were held every two months during the first 12 
months and every four months during the remainder of the study period (10 total reunion 
sessions). To ensure implementation fidelity, trained evaluators observed all the sessions and 
scored each session and the activity components according to an evaluation checklist. 
During the study period, 192 group sessions were carried out (96 for PLH and 96 for family 
members) and 18 community events organized. In addition, 202 reunion sessions were 
conducted in a group format. The overall participation in the TEA intervention activities was 
about 95% for the PLH and 94% for their family members.
Control Condition
PLH in the control group continued to receive the Chinese government’s standard of care for 
the population. In addition, limited program activities were added to the control group to 
tease out intervention effects from the impact of attention. The intervention and control 
conditions differed in both contents and formats. There were three group sessions once a 
week, with the content areas focused on healthy daily routine, antiretroviral drugs adherence 
and side effects, nutrition, and personal and family hygiene. These control group sessions 
were didactic lecture-based health education, with no interactive activities between 
facilitators and participants nor between PLH and family members. In addition, village 
health workers visited the control group families once a week for the initial three weeks and 
once a month for 12 months.
Participants
Baseline data were collected from October 2011 to March 2013. To be eligible for the study, 
the PLH had to 1) be 18 years or older, 2) be HIV sero-positive, 3) have a HIV sero-negative 
family member in the same household, 4) have a child between 6–18 years in his/her family, 
and 5) reside in one of the selected villages. The inclusion criteria for family members were 
that they had to 1) be 18 years or older, 2) be HIV sero-negative, 3) live with the PLH in the 
same household, and 4) have knowledge of the PLH’s HIV sero-status. To recruit 
participants, information flyers about the study were posted in the village clinics where PLH 
obtained routine care. PLH who were interested in participating in the study could either 
directly contact the project staff using the contact information printed on the flyer or ask the 
clinic health workers to be referred to a project recruiter. The recruited PLH were asked to 
invite one of his or her family members to participate in the study. If the invited family 
member was also HIV sero-positive, then he or she will be recruited as a PLH participant, 
and an additional HIV sero-negative family member will be recruited from the same 
household. When recruiting participants, our trained recruiter explained the study purpose, 
procedure, potential risks and benefits, and guaranteed confidentiality and voluntary nature 
of their participation. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The 
refusal rate for the initial recruitment was less than 5%. Based on the epidemiological data 
reported by the Anhui provincial CDC office, the study has reached more than 85% of the 
eligible families in the study villages.
Procedures
At baseline and at each of the follow-up points, both the PLH and family member 
participants completed an assessment using the Computer Assisted Personal Interview Li et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
(CAPI) method. All the assessments were conducted in a private room of a village clinic or 
another private place where the participant preferred. Each assessment took approximately 
45–60 minutes, and all the participants were compensated 50 yuan (8 USD) for each 
assessment. The participant did not receive incentives for participating in the intervention 
activities.
Outcome Measures
Depressive symptoms were measured for both the PLH and their family members using a 
shortened version of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale ( Zung, 1965 ). The scale has 
been validated in our previous pilot study among PLH and their family members in China 
(Li et al., 2011 ). Participants were asked how often they felt each of the nine situations, 
including “I get tired for no reason”, “I have trouble sleeping at night”, and “I feel hopeful 
about the future”. The responses ranged from (1) “a little of the time” to (4) “most of the 
time” with some items that were reverse coded. The overall score was the sum of each item, 
and a higher score implied a higher level of depressive symptoms (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81).
Coping with illness reported by the PLH was measured using an adapted version of Namir 
and colleagues’ instrument that assesses active cognitive and behavioral efforts to cope with 
HIV ( Namir Wolcott, Fayzy, & Alumbaugh, 1987 ). Two subscales, active cognitive  and 
behavioral coping , were used in the study. The two scales consisted of 14 items. Participants 
responded to the question, “Which of these things have you used to help you deal with your 
illness?” using a five-point scale from (1) “never” to (5) “always”. The active cognitive 
coping subscale includes items such as “thought about the positive changes in me since the 
illness” and “formed a plan of action in my mind”; the active behavioral coping subscale 
included items such as “went out more socially” and “tried to find out more about my 
illness”. A higher summary score indicated a better ability to cope with the illness 
cognitively and behaviorally (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80).
Caregiver burden perceived by family members was measured using the Perceived Caregiver 
Burden Scale ( Stommel, Given, & Given, 1990 ), which has been used in our previous study 
in Asia ( Lee, Li, Lin, & Tuan, 2015 ). Family members’ perception of having a PLH in the 
household and its impact on their finances, health, and feelings of entrapment were assessed 
using the modified 17-item scale. Sample items include “Caring for him/her has put a 
financial strain on the family”, “My health has gotten worse since I have been caring for 
him/her”, and “I feel trapped by my caregiving role”. Responses to each item ranged from 
(1) “strongly disagree” to (5) “strongly agree”, and a higher score reflected a higher level of 
overall burden perceived by family caregivers (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.88).
In addition, the participants’ age, gender, education level, marital status, family annual 
income and family size, and family members’ relationship with the PLH were collected.
Statistical Analysis
Study populations by intervention assignment were characterized using descriptive statistics 
and frequencies. Baseline characteristics between the intervention and control conditions 
were compared using Chi-square tests and random-effects models for categorical and 
continuous characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, we graphically examined the pattern Li et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
of improvement for each outcome measure over time by plotting the mean score of each 
measure over time by intervention condition.
All the analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. We used a mixed-effects 
regression model with village- and participant-level random effects to assess an intervention 
effect on the improvement of each mental health measure. The fixed-effects included the 
pre-selected individual characteristics (age, gender, marital status, and education) and family 
background (annual household income and size of family), group assignment (control vs. 
intervention), visit (baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month), and group-by-visit interaction. 
Two levels of random effects, village- and participant-level random effects, were included in 
the model to account for the dependence within the villages and the correlation between 
repeated observations for each participant. The intervention effect at each follow-up visit 
was defined as a difference in changes from baseline between the intervention and control 
groups and was estimated through model contrasts. All the statistical analyses were carried 
out using the SAS System for Windows 9.4 (Statistical Analysis Software, Cary, NC).
Results
Sample Characteristics
As shown in Figure 1, among the 475 families, 237 families (257 PLH and 237 family 
members) were randomized to the intervention condition and 238 families (265 PLH and 
238 family members) to the control condition. The follow-up rate at the 24-month follow-up 
for the PLH was 91% in the intervention group and 84% in the control group. For family 
members, the 24-month follow-up rate for the intervention group was 88% and the control 
group was 81%. Participants’ characteristics and their outcome measures at baseline are 
summarized in Table 1. The average age for the PLH in the intervention group was older 
than those in the control group (50 vs. 47, p = 0.0003). Less than 50% of the PLH were men 
(42% vs. 47% for intervention vs. control, respectively), approximately 40% had no 
education, and more than 80% of the participants were married. Approximately 65% of the 
family member participants were women, the average age was about 42 years old, slightly 
less than half were the PLH’s spouse, and approximately 30% had an educational level of 
junior high school or above. The median annual income was 20,000 yuan (3,030 USD), and 
over one-third of the families had more than six members. At baseline, no significant 
differences were observed across the two study arms for gender, education, marital status or 
relationship to PLH, annual income, and family size. The PLH in the intervention group had 
a significantly higher coping with illness score than those in the control group (35.3 vs. 33.4, 
respectively; p = 0.008). Other outcome measures reported by the PLH and family members 
were comparable across the two intervention conditions.
Change in Measures over Time
The unadjusted mean plots of the outcome measures reported by the PLH and family 
members are presented in Figure 2A/2B and Figure 3A/3B, respectively. Figure 2A shows 
that the mean depressive symptoms reported by the PLH in both groups were similar at 
baseline, and the level of depressive symptoms reported by the intervention participants 
decreased more rapidly than that reported by the participants in the control condition. The Li et al. Page 6

differences in the reduction in depressive symptoms were maintained across the rest of the 
follow-up visits. In Figure 2B, the coping with illness score for the PLH in the intervention 
and control groups were slightly different at baseline. The mean curve for the intervention 
PLH participants ascended at the 6-month follow-up and descended gradually after the one-
year follow-up, whereas the mean curve for the control PLH participants decreased from 
baseline. The largest difference in the improvement in the coping with illness score occurred 
six months after the baseline. In Figure 3A, the pattern of the mean curves for the depressive 
symptoms of the family members was similar to those of the PLH (Figure 2A). The mean 
levels of caregiver burden decreased over time for both groups (Figure 3B). The rate of 
change in caregiver burden reported by the intervention participants was slightly faster than 
that reported by the control group.
Intervention Effects on the PLH’s Measures
Table 2 shows that a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms reported by PLH 
in the intervention versus control conditions consistently over time, as seen in Figure 2A. 
Women reported a significant higher level of depressive symptoms on average than men 
(estimate=−2.15±0.38, p < 0.0001). Age was positively associated with depressive 
symptoms (estimate=0.08±0.02, p = 0.0002). The PLH from the families in the lowest 
annual income category reported a higher level of depressive symptoms 
(estimate=2.69±1.02, p = 0.007).
Similarly, we observed a significant intervention effect on the coping with illness reported 
by PLH consistently over time while the coping with illness reported by the intervention 
PLH was higher than the control PLH at baseline (difference = 2.18, SE = 0.71, p = 0.002). 
The largest intervention effect on coping with illness was occurred at the 6-month follow-up 
(difference = 4.44, SE = 0.84, p < 0.0001); the group difference slowly reduced over time, 
but remained significant up to the two-year follow-up period. Male participants 
(estimate=1.10±0.52, p = 0.035) reported a higher score in coping with illness. Having no 
formal education (estimate=−2.25±0.78, p = 0.004) and having five or six family members 
(estimate=−1.18±0.52, p = 0.025) were associated with a lower score in coping with illness.
Intervention Effects on the Family Members’ Measures
Results from the adjusted analysis indicated that a significant intervention effect on 
depressive symptoms reported by family members was observed over time, similar to the 
reduction in depressive symptoms reported by PLH (in Table 3). The largest group 
difference in the reduction of depressive symptoms was observed at 12 months after baseline 
(difference = 2.17, SE = 0.44, p < 0.001). Older age (estimate=0.09±0.01, p < 0.0001), 
female gender (estimate=1.22± 0.40, p = 0.003), and having no education 
(estimate=1.55±0.54, p = 0.004) were associated with higher level of depressive symptoms. 
Those family members in the lowest annual family income category reported having the 
highest depressive symptoms (estimate=2.61±1.03, p = 0.012).
We observed significant decreases in the perceived caregiver burden over time for both the 
intervention and control groups (Figure 3B) (both p-values < 0.005). The between-group 
differences in reduction were not statistically significant. Those of older age Li et al. Page 7

(estimate=0.17±0.03, p < 0.0001) and being female (estimate=1.68±0.78, p = 0.031) were 
positively associated with a higher level of reported caregiver burden. Being the PLH’s 
spouse (estimate=−3.94±0.74, p < 0.0001) was associated with a lower level of caregiver 
burden compared to being a non-spouse family member.
Discussion
This paper presents the efficacy of a multilevel large-scale randomized controlled 
intervention to improve the mental health of PLH and their family members. Overall, both 
target populations reported significant improvements in mental health indicators at the 6-, 
12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-ups compared with those in the control condition. The 
findings suggest that both the PLH and family members could benefit from an intervention 
that addresses their common and specific challenges associated with HIV . The TEA 
intervention focused on family interconnection and supporting families impacted by HIV to 
confront the challenges together rather than individually. The inclusion of both the PLH and 
family members may have provided a unique environment to stimulate conversations and 
strengthen interactions within a family. During difficult times, it may become particularly 
important for family members to support each other, and their psychological wellbeing plays 
an important role in the process of overcoming challenges together. Furthermore, through 
community intervention activities, participants within the villages could become more aware 
of familiar challenges shared by other families in the neighborhood and come together to 
form a social network for community support. The multiple layers of intervention that 
happened concurrently may have synergized in achieving a greater overall impact on PLH 
and family members’ mental health.
It is worthwhile to mention that although both the PLH and family members benefited from 
the intervention in regards to the alleviation of depressive symptoms, the patterns of change 
were different between the two populations. Both the PLH and family members in the 
intervention condition reported a steep reduction in depressive symptoms at the 6-month 
follow-up. However, the largest difference between the family members of the intervention 
and control groups occurred at the 12-month follow-up, and its magnitude was reduced at 
the 18- and 24-month follow-ups, whereas the intervention effects on depressive symptoms 
of PLH were sustained at a similar level. One explanation is that the intervention had the 
most direct impact on the PLH and family members after the initial, intensive activities. 
Family members in the intervention condition benefited the most after the initial 
intervention, but the effects lasted a shorter period of time than that for the PLH. It is of note 
that PLH and their family members in the control condition showed decreased depressive 
symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, which may be due to the perceived attention from the 
reoccurring surveys ( Tourangeau, 2003 ).
Several demographic and family characteristics were found to be related to the mental health 
status of the PLH and their family members. Women reported more depressive symptoms 
than men, similar to the findings of other studies ( Passos & Souza, 2015 ; Pereira & 
Canavarro, 2011 ). In traditional Chinese families, women are typically the primary 
caregivers ( Stein et al., 2000 ). When a woman herself is infected, she struggles to balance 
the stress and burden to take care of herself and the rest of her family. These results point to Li et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
the importance of identifying and treating depressions as an essential element in the 
comprehensive care of women impacted by HIV . Families in the least income experienced 
the most mental health challenges. Financial hardships may induce more stress for HIV-
affected families as they cope with illness and struggle to make ends meet. More resources 
are needed to provide care for those with limited financial resources to protect and promote 
mental health. Another area that deserves further investigation is caregiver burden perceived 
by the spouse vs. the non-spouse family members. Future intervention programs need to take 
these factors into consideration and address these issues in the program design and 
implementation.
Limitations
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. First, our study was 
conducted in an area where a large proportion of PLH were former commercial plasma 
donors who were infected in the mid-1990s. Thus, the study results may not be generalizable 
to those PLH who were infected via other transmission routes and lived in different 
geographical regions. Second, the outcome measures relied on self-reports, which could be 
influenced by social desirability. The third limitation concerned eligibility criteria. For the 
PLH to be eligible for the study, they had to have disclosed their HIV status to at least one 
family member. It is possible that the mental health measures reported by those who had not 
disclosed their status to any family members were different from those who participated in 
our study. Fourth, the study faced measurement issues that only individual-level data were 
collected, so we would not be able to demonstrate the intervention effect on families and 
communities. Additionally, the individual-level outcomes were a combined effect of multi-
layered intervention activities, and data collected were insufficient to assess the within- and 
cross-level effects. With the data in hand, we would not be able to distinguish the key 
driving factor behind the results. Lastly, although some of the differences reached statistical 
significance, the small effect sizes may limit the implication of the findings.
Conclusion
Reduced depressive symptoms are attainable for both PLH and their family members with 
an intervention that involved the individual, their family, and their community. Although 
PLH and their family members have to deal with their specific issues (e.g., coping with the 
illness for the PLH, perceived caregiver burden for the family members), facing these 
challenges together as a family has been a powerful message from the intervention. This 
intervention model has the potential to be adapted to different cultures with family-oriented 
traditions. As the HIV epidemic transitions to a manageable chronic illness, PLH need the 
strength of their families more than ever. Future interventions should continue to target PLH 
as well as their family members and focus on family capital as an important component in 
the wellbeing of PLH. Family-based services, possibly integrating mental health services, 
need to be established to provide assistance to and address the specific needs of families 
affected by HIV .Li et al. Page 9
