ABSTRACT
Objective: Family members of stroke survivors are often not
supported for their caring role, with many reporting adjustment
diﬃculties. This paper describes the development and content of
a group-based intervention for informal carers of stroke survivors.
Method: The intervention is based on the theoretical foundation of
the biopsychosocial model with the aim to understand and address
the physical, psychological and social factors of caring for stroke
survivors. Findings from a comprehensive literature review and aqualitative study with carers and stroke professionals were
synthesized to guide the intervention development. The
Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR)checklist was used as a framework to describe the intervention.
Results: The intervention integrates cognitive-behavioural
approaches via the identi ﬁcation of the biopsychosocial (physical,
emotional, social) factors that can have an impact on the well-
being of carers. It includes education on stroke-speci ﬁc topics
and advice on coping strategies. It consists of six structured two-
hour group sessions facilitated in a community setting. It
provides information and support on adjusting to the caring role
in the ﬁrst year post-stroke. Intervention materials were designed
for addressing carers ’speciﬁc needs using psychological
techniques, such as problem-solving, goal setting and relaxation
exercises.
Conclusion: We have underlined the importance for describing and
reporting the process of intervention development for complex
interventions in the context of stroke rehabilitation. Anintervention addressing the needs of informal stroke carers
(Biopsychosocial Intervention for Stroke Carers; BISC) has been
developed and described. BISC was further evaluated in a single-
centre feasibility randomized controlled trial.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Stroke can have devastating consequences, and caring long-term for a stroke survivor can
have a variety of adverse e ﬀects on the entire family (Stroke Association, 2019 ). Informal
carers, often spouses or family members, play an important role in the early rehabilita-
tion and long-term management of stroke survivors (McCullagh, Brigstocke, Donaldson,& Kalra, 2005 ). Carers of stroke survivors are more commonly female than male spouses
(Kniepmann, 2012 ) with gender di ﬀerences observed in the adjustment process to the
caring role (Alexander & Wilz, 2010 ). Several studies report greater physical and
emotional wellbeing among female carers of stroke survivors (Kniepmann, 2012 ). A sys-
tematic review reported a 25 –54% prevalence of carer burden for an inde ﬁnite period fol-
lowing stroke (Rigby, Gubitz, & Phillips, 2009 ). The UK ’s national stroke charity
conducted a national survey and found that 85% of carers don ’t get the support or infor-
mation they need (Stroke Association, 2019 ). Family members providing informal and
unpaid care are referred to as carers throughout this paper.
Little evidence is available on the e ﬀectiveness of interventions targeted at carers and
the provision of carer-speci ﬁc services can be limited (Victor, 2009 ). Research has ident-
iﬁed the importance of education and support tailored to the speci ﬁc and varied needs of
stroke carers across the care pathway (Cameron & Gignac, 2008 ). However, only a min-
ority of interventions have been developed, evaluated and implemented speci ﬁcally for
carers of stroke survivors (Robinson et al., 2005 ) and evidence regarding e ﬀectiveness
is uncertain and limited (Cheng, Chair, & Chau, 2014 ; Forster et al., 2012 ; Legg et al.,
2011 ).
One review (Legg et al., 2011 ) identi ﬁed a structured stroke caregiver training pro-
gramme that demonstrated improved outcomes in a single-centre feasibility RandomisedControlled Trial (RCT) (Kalra et al., 2004 ). In a subsequent pragmatic multicentre trial,
the intervention was found to have no e ﬀect on carers ’burden when delivered by multi-
disciplinary hospital stroke teams (Forster et al., 2013 ).
Recently, many interventions aimed at supporting carers of stroke survivors have been
evaluated with some preliminary positive results (Araújo, Lage, Cabrita, & Teixeira, 2018 ;
Day et al., 2021 ) and others reported more conclusive ﬁndings but with no evidence on
clinical or cost-e ﬀectiveness (Patchwood et al., 2021 ). However, many of these interven-
tions often neglect to address the physical and psychological well-being of carers and
focus more on the provision of information and practical support for preparing to
manage the complex needs of stroke survivors for the transition from hospital to
home care. In the UK and India, this involved multidisciplinary intervention studiesfor training carers to support stroke survivors with personal care, activities of daily
living or other rehabilitation tasks (Forster et al., 2014 ; Lindley et al., 2017 ).
A systematic review of psychological health interventions for carers of stroke survivors
underlined the importance of such interventions for reducing psychological distress and
highlighted that interventions tailored to meet carers ’speciﬁc needs showed more
favourable outcome (Panzeri, Rossi Ferrario, & Vidotto, 2019 ).
We have developed the Biopsychosocial Intervention for Stroke Carers (BISC) which
is a new bespoke intervention speci ﬁcally targeted to the needs of carers after discharge
from hospital and within the ﬁrst year post-stroke. The intervention was designed based
on the priorities identi ﬁed by key stakeholders and by following recommendations forHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 93
the development of complex interventions (MRC, 2006 ). The acceptability and feasibility
of this intervention compared to usual care were evaluated in a UK-based single-centre
feasibility RCT (Trial registration: ISRCTN15643456) and the trial protocol has beendescribed (Walker, Thomas, et al., 2017 ). The feasibility trial results were published in
a subsequent paper with the primary focus reporting rates of recruitment, retention of
participants in the intervention and completion of follow-up outcome measures
(Walker et al., 2020 ). Findings suggested that the intervention content was acceptable
and informative, however, the feasibility paper did not describe the process of interven-
tion development or provide a detailed description of the intervention. The feasibility
trial reinforced the importance of reporting the process and robustness of interventiondevelopment before considering further evaluation in a future de ﬁnitive RCT. Few
studies in stroke rehabilitation clearly or adequately describe how complex interventions
are developed thereby hindering their use and application in clinical and research prac-tice (Walker, Ho ﬀmann, et al., 2017 ). Describing the intervention development process
and detailed content of a new complex intervention has the potential to facilitate learning
about future intervention research (Duncan et al., 2020 ).
This paper aims to describe the process of developing the BISC intervention for carers
of stroke survivors and to supply a detailed description of the intervention elements
ahead of a further evaluation.
Intervention development
The intervention development was an integral part of a mixed-methods project with
two distinct phases: a qualitative study (Condon, Benford, Kontou, Thomas, &
Walker, 2019 ) and a feasibility RCT with a nested qualitative study (Walker et al.,
2020 ; Walker, Thomas, et al., 2017 ). This overall research project received favourable
ethical approval from the National Health Service Research Authority (ref: 14/EMI/
1264). Particular attention was given to the key stages of intervention development
recommended by the Medical Research Council framework (Campbell et al., 2000 ;
MRC, 2006 ). The TIDieR guidelines and the consensus-based core recommendations
for the development of stroke rehabilitation interventions (Ho ﬀmann et al., 2014 ;
Walker, Ho ﬀmann, et al., 2017 ).Figure 1 describes the overall process of intervention
development.
The intervention was developed by incorporating the ﬁndings from a literature review
and a qualitative study to establish priority areas. The qualitative study involved focus
groups and individual interviews with carers of stroke survivors and a nominal grouptechnique discussion with stroke care academics and clinicians. A ﬁnal consensus on
the shared priority topics for the intervention was agreed; this was presented in a separate
published paper (Condon et al., 2019 ).
The intervention manual was designed and reviewed by a multidisciplinary group
of stroke researchers, professionals and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) repre-
sentatives. This ensured that relevant knowledge and experience among the studyteam was used to develop an appropriate intervention manual that would be relevant
and acceptable for applying the intervention in a single-centre feasibility RCT (Walker
et al., 2020 ).94 E. KONTOU ET AL.
The BISC intervention ( ‘Biopsychosocial Intervention for Stroke Carers ’)
The theoretical underpinning of the intervention is based on the biopsychosocial model
of health, which is a framework that integrates the biological, psychological and socialfactors that are known to in ﬂuence an individual ’s well-being (Engel, 1977 ).
This model is now widely used in research investigating complex healthcare interven-
tions and provides a holistic account of health and illness behaviours whilst focused onthe person and their contexts (Wade & Halligan, 2017 ). It takes into account severalFigure 1. Flowchart for the development process of an intervention for stroke carers.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 95
factors that may a ﬀect an individual ’s presenting di ﬃculties in the context of rehabilita-
tion (Wade, 2015 ) and therefore can be relevant for the understanding of the impact of
stroke on carers ’health (physical and emotional).
The BISC intervention combines education about the biological, psychological and
social e ﬀects of stroke and ways of adapting to the caregiving role. It aims to equip
carers of stroke survivors with proactive coping strategies focussing on adjusting to
their new role. The intervention provides information, advice and support on di ﬀerent
topics, while highlighting the importance of self-care and setting achievable goals
while caring for a family member or friend.
This paper presents a description and structure of the BISC intervention in accordance
with the TIDieR checklist for better reporting of interventions (Ho ﬀmann et al., 2014 )
(Table 1 ).
Participants
The intervention is designed to be o ﬀered to informal carers (spouses, family members or
friends) providing support for a stroke survivor who would have otherwise experiencedconsiderable di ﬃculties managing without their assistance and support after hospital dis-
charge. The intervention is delivered to carers only. Stroke carers can opt in to take part
in the intervention from the early stages of diagnosis and within the ﬁrst year post-stroke.
Materials
The intervention manual has the lay title ‘Looking after your health and well-being when
caring for someone who has had a stroke ’.
Each group session is focused on a particular topic, and content is presented ﬂexibly
using presentation slides, ﬂipcharts or session handouts. The facilitator decides what
format is most suitable according to group size and how interaction between groupmembers unfolds.
The intervention manual containing the materials of all individual sessions is provided
to carers at the ﬁrst session. An extended version of this manual with session-by-session

supplementary guidance is available for the facilitator to ensure that the content of the
intervention is delivered consistently. Each session ’s outline and summary are presented
in the Supplementary Material; BISC Manual Outline .
Facilitator and location
A facilitator with knowledge and understanding of stroke should deliver this interven-
tion. For instance, it is intended that the sessions can be facilitated by an assistant psy-
chologist or someone with the equivalent experience and expertise. The facilitatorshould receive speci ﬁc training in the delivery of this intervention and clinical supervi-
sion by a healthcare professional with experience in stroke and/or mental health.
It is recommended that the intervention takes place in an easily accessible community
setting after the stroke survivor has been discharged from the hospital and up to 1-yearpost-stroke. It is primarily designed to be delivered in a group format. Each group should
ideally comprise up to ﬁve stroke carers. This group size allows more time to focus on
each member ’s experiences of caring for a stroke survivor and to ensure that the facili-
tator can e ﬀectively manage interactions between group members. Although this inter-
vention is intended for delivery in a group format, it has the potential to be tailored
by the facilitator if required to be o ﬀered on a one-to-one basis.
Description of the intervention
The intervention consists of six structured two-hour group sessions focused on adjust-
ment to stroke and the caregiving role, provision of education and psychological
support. If participants are not able to attend a session, then the facilitator is availableto debrief them and respond to any queries at the beginning of the next session.
Elements of the intervention draw upon cognitive-behavioural therapy principles,
such as goal-setting and in-between session tasks. At the beginning of the intervention,the value of relaxation is introduced and an optional relaxation exercise is presented at
the end of each session. Each session includes group discussions and an in-between
session task (referred to as ‘Home Practice ’). All sessions start with the participants
reviewing progress with their ‘Home Practice ’. This promotes engagement with the
material learnt during the group sessions and setting achievable goals for the future.
Theﬁrst session begins with an introduction about stroke and its e ﬀects on the survi-
vor and carers. The biopsychosocial model is presented as a way of understanding theinﬂuence of di ﬀerent factors and how their interaction may a ﬀect an individual ’s well-
being. Participants are introduced to the topics addressed as part of this intervention
and they are given time to get to know each other. During the second session, educationis provided about adjusting to the e ﬀects of stroke and the caregiver role. Sessions 3, 4, 5
introduce cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) principles for noticing di ﬃcult emotions
and managing unhelpful thoughts, dealing with problems and identifying strategies forcoping more e ﬀectively. Session 6, the ﬁnal session, summarises all previous sessions
and starts with the idea of creating a well-being action plan (referred to as a ‘Wellbeing
Toolbox ’). This task has a practical focus and it aims to help stroke carers re ﬂect on what
they have learned and what strategies they can best implement to cope with present orfuture setbacks.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 97

Discussion
Given the urgent need to support carers for stroke survivors (Stroke Association, 2019 ),
we developed a new group-based intervention, named BISC, for promoting the well-
being of people who take on an informal caring role.
The phase of intervention development is often under-reported or not adequately
described when published as part of a feasibility or pilot study (Duncan et al., 2020 ).
This paper aims to describe the iterative process of developing a complex intervention
by incorporating evidence from theory, research and collaboration with key stakeholdersfor determining its content for carers of stroke survivors.
The overall aim of the BISC intervention was to provide carers with the education and
practical tools needed to adjust to the physical, psychological and social stresses that theymay experience taking on the caring role within the ﬁrst year post-stroke (Hall, Crocker,
Clarke, & Forster, 2019 ). To achieve this goal, we developed an intervention manual and
materials based on the biopsychosocial model of wellbeing (Engel, 1977 ), including ses-
sions focused on the e ﬀects of stroke, adjustment to the caregiving role and coping strat-
egies to look after their wellbeing. Instead of focusing on problems, the intervention is
shaped by ideas and discussions on generating solutions, setting goals and developingplans for future setbacks in therapeutic progress. The e ﬀectiveness of psychological tech-
niques based on cognitive-behavioural and problem-solving therapy techniques has been
reported in other intervention studies for improving the psychological health of stroke
carers (Panzeri et al., 2019 ).
A strength of this study is that the topics covered during all group sessions of the BISC
intervention emerged from a review of the relevant literature, interviews with stroke
carers and a nominal group consensus meeting with expert clinicians and researchers(Condon et al., 2019 ). Another key element of the intervention development process
was patient and public involvement (PPI) and such a collaborative approach is rec-
ommended in intervention studies organising support for carers of stroke survivors(Patchwood et al., 2021 ). This allowed the tailoring of the intervention to the speci ﬁc
needs of the people providing care to stroke survivors as focused interventions have

been found to be more e ﬀective and e ﬃcient (Panzeri et al., 2019 ). Involving carers in the
development process ensured that the intervention is acceptable and developed in ‘real’
partnership with a multidisciplinary team of stroke professionals (Brereton, Carroll, &Barnston, 2007 ).
Another strength is that the proposed intervention has been manualised, with written
materials available for the participants and additional notes for the facilitator. This is
essential for research purposes, but also for future implementation of evidence-basedinterventions in clinical practice with documented advantages about intervention
eﬃcacy as well as the training and supervision of facilitators (Wilson, 1998 ).
The BISC intervention is designed to be delivered by an assistant psychologist or a
healthcare professional with skills and competences in basic psychological principles.
This may be considered a strength as a recent systematic review suggested that interven-
tions for stroke carers led by psychologists showed more positive outcomes (Panzeriet al., 2019 ). It also enables other stroke professionals such as occupational therapists,
rehabilitation assistants or nurses to be trained to deliver this intervention with appro-
priate support and supervision by a quali ﬁed psychologist.
As the intervention was designed to be delivered to carers early post-hospital dis-
charge in the stroke care pathway, it could be regarded as preventative against worsening
psychosocial di ﬃculties. It is primarily designed as a low-level intervention providing
education, self-help and signposting. This is in line with the provision of stepped psycho-logical care after stroke, and the need for providing interventions for stroke survivors and
their families adjusting to life after stroke (National Improvement Programme, 2011 ).
However, this may be considered a limitation since it reduces its generalizability foruse with carers who may su ﬀer from depression or other signi ﬁcant mental health
diﬃculties.
The di ﬀerent phases of intervention development (e.g. establishing intervention pri-
orities, stakeholder involvement) do not necessarily mean that all uncertainties havebeen addressed. For example, we were not able to specify the criteria for the optimal
delivery format (e.g. one-to-one versus group format) and this is yet to be determined.
Although group-based interventions may be less acceptable and accessible to somepeople, there are several reasons why they may be more bene ﬁcial to others, such as
peer support and social learning (Sadler, Sarre, Tinker, Bhalla, & McKevitt, 2017 ; Sören-
sen, Pinquart, & Duberstein, 2002 ). Delivering the intervention in a group format is also
likely to be more time and cost-e ﬃcient (Söchting, 2014 ), which would be important
given the high demand and limited provision of psychological input in stroke services
(Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme, 2020 ).
A wide range of approaches could have informed the development of this interven-
tion which is underlined by cognitive-behavioural therapy principles. The intervention
development group aimed to reach consensus on which strategies and techniques lendthemselves well to a time-limited group intervention that aims to provide educationand emotional support (Condon et al., 2019 ; Söchting, 2014 ). The involvement of
individuals with research knowledge and clinical experience in stroke ensured that
this intervention integrates multiple interacting components and has a multidisciplin-ary focus.
The Medical Research Council Framework (MRC, 2006 ; Skivington et al., 2021 ) for
the development and evaluation of complex interventions identi ﬁes interventionHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 99
development as the ﬁrst of a series of interconnected phases. However, to our knowledge
there are very few published intervention development studies aimed at supporting
carers of stroke survivors (Hall et al., 2019 ). It is important to acknowledge that there
are many ways to develop a new complex intervention, however, the success and appro-priateness of the intervention development process can be evaluated in line with the con-
sensus-based GUIDED recommendations (Duncan et al., 2020 ).
This paper highlights the iterative process of developing the BISC intervention devel-
opment and provides an example for reporting intervention development research which
can guide other researchers looking at investigating the e ﬀectiveness of supportive inter-
ventions for carers of stroke survivors. Clinicians could potentially identify some inter-vention components that can be incorporated in their everyday practice when supporting
carers of stroke survivors, such as the consideration of the biopsychosocial model of
health and wellbeing (Wade & Halligan, 2017 ).
The intervention is not yet suitable for implementation in clinical practice as its
eﬃcacy has yet to be determined. Further information as to how this intervention
might be further re ﬁned and evaluated has been described in the BISC feasibility ran-
domised controlled trial results paper (Walker et al., 2020 ). Future work is required to
address any uncertainties regarding the intensity, mode of delivery, materials, or type
of location that the intervention is most suitable for. The current paper describes the
BISC intervention and can inform future research to optimise support interventionsfor carers of stroke survivors.
