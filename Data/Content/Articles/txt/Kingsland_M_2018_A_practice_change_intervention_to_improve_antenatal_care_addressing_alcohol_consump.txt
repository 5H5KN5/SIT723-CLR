Abstract
Background: Despite clinical guideline recommendations, implementation of antenatal care addressing alcohol
consumption by pregnant women is limited. Implementation strategies addressing barriers to such care may be
effective in increasing care provision. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness
of a multi-strategy practice change intervention in increasing antenatal care addressing the consumption of alcohol by
pregnant women.
Methods: The study will be a randomised, stepped-wedge controlled trial conducted in three sectors in a health
district in New South Wales, Australia. Stepped implementation of a practice change intervention will be delivered
to sectors in a random order to support the introduction of a model of care for addressing alcohol consumption by
pregnant women. A staged process was undertaken to develop the implementation strategies, which comprise of:
leadership support, local clinical practice guidelines, electronic prompts and reminders, opinion leaders, academic
detailing (audit and feedback), educational meetings and educational materials, and performance monitoring.
Repeated cross-sectional outcome data will be gathered weekly across all sectors for the study duration. The primary
outcome measures are the proport ion of antenatal appointments at ‘booking in ’,2 7 –28 weeks gestation and 35 –36 weeks
gestation for which women report (1) being assessed for alcohol consumption, (2) being provided with brief advice related
to alcohol consumption during pregnancy, (3) receiving relevant care for addressing alcohol consumption during
pregnancy, and (4) being assessed for alcohol consump tion and receiving relevant care. Data on resources
expended during intervention development and implem entation will be collected. The proportion of women
who report consuming alcohol since knowing they were pregnant will be measured as a secondary outcome.

Discussion: This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness
of implementation strategies in improving antenatal care that addresses alcohol consumption by pregnant women. If
positive changes in clinical practice are found, this evidence will support health service adoption of implementation
strategies to support improved antenatal care for this recognised risk to the health and wellbeing of the mother and
child.

Background
Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associ-
ated with a number of adverse obstetric, fetal and child
outcomes with lifelong consequences. These include, Fetal
Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), miscarriage, stillbirth,
preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and low birth weight
[1]. No safe level of prenatal alcohol exposure has been
established for the foetus and therefore many countries, in-
cluding Australia, have national guidelines recommending
that the safest option is for women to abstain from alcohol
consumption when trying to conceive, during conception
and during pregnancy [ 1–3].
Despite this recommendation, 10% of women world-
wide consume alcohol during pregnancy, with notably
higher prevalence estimates in regions with high levels of
general alcohol consumption, such as the World Health
Organisation European Region (prevalence estimate of
alcohol consumption in pregnancy, 25%) [ 4]. In Australia,
national surveys and prospective cohort studies report the
prevalence of maternal alcohol consumption at any time
during pregnancy to be between 35 and 72% [ 5–10]. For
example, a prospective cohort study of 1403 women
attending antenatal clinics in the Australian states of
New South Wales and Western Australia found that
61% of women consumed alcohol between conception
and pregnancy recognition, often at risky levels. Of these
women, approximately 30% continued to drink alcohol
once they were aware they were pregnant [ 10]. Similarly, a
study of 1570 women attending public antenatal clinics in
Melbourne, Australia, found that just over half (54%) of
women consumed alcohol in the first trimester, and half
of these women continued to consume alcohol through-
out the remainder of their pregnancy [ 8].
Health services providing antenatal care represent an
opportune setting to address m aternal alcohol consumption
during pregnancy. Systematic review evidence shows that
psychological and educational i nterventions for pregnant
women may reduce alcohol consumption and increase
abstinence from alcohol [ 11]. Additional evidence suggests
that clinician assessment of a lcohol consumption and brief
interventions, including motivational interviewing, may alsoreduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy [ 12–18].
Efforts to reduce alcohol cons umption during pregnancy in
antenatal settings is also acceptable to women, with 97% of
Australian women indicating that they wanted information
about alcohol use during pregnancy and would be willing
to change their alcohol consumption if advised to do so
[19]. Consistent with this evidence, international, [ 20]a s
well as Australian national [ 21,22] and state clinical
guidelines [ 23,24] recommend that health professionals
providing antenatal care use a validated tool to assess
alcohol consumption for all pregnant women at the initial
visit and throughout the antenatal period, provide brief
advice about the potential harms of alcohol consumption
during pregnancy and recommend abstinence, and refer
women to specialist services if they require assistance to
stop consuming alcohol.
Despite clear recommendations in clinical guidelines,
implementation of antenatal care addressing maternal
alcohol consumption during pregnancy is limited. Inter-
nationally, studies show that pregnant women are not
routinely assessed for their alcohol consumption during
antenatal consultations are not consistently provided with
information regarding the effects of alcohol consumption
during pregnancy and receive inconsistent advice regarding
alcohol intake [ 25–27]. For instance, in Canada, only 50%
of health professionals report providing advice to pregnant
women regarding the consumption of alcohol [ 28]a n d ,i n
the UK, only two thirds of women reported receiving such
advice from a midwife [ 29]. In Australia, a study of 1143 of
health professionals who provide antenatal care found
that fewer than half (45%) ro utinely asked about alcohol
consumption during pregnancy, only 25% provided in-
formation on the effects of alcohol consumption during
pregnancy, and only 13% provided advice consistent with
national drinking guidelines [ 30,31]. A more recent study
involving 166 midwives in Western Australia found that
while almost all midwives (93%) asked pregnant women
about their alcohol consumption, only 54% used a stan-
dardised assessment tool [ 32].
A small number of studies have been conducted to assess
barriers to the provision of car e addressing maternal alcoholKingsland et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:112 Page 2 of 14
consumption during pregnan cy. These barriers include a
lack of systems and/or tools to prompt clinician assessment
of alcohol consumption, concer ns about patient sensitivity
and stigmatisation, lack of staff time, need for staff training,
limited access to or knowledge of clinical and patient
resources, including culturally appropriate resources
for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, lack
of referral options, a perceived lack of skill in delivering
care, and a lack of understanding of the importance of
providing such care to all women [ 33–36]. Additionally,
the literature on clinical guideline implementation more
broadly indicates that other barriers (including commit-
ment to change from organisational leaders/champions,
perceived value/need and readiness to change, skills, ability
and confidence, and an absence of systems and tools to
support/prompt care delivery) commonly impede changes
in professional practice [ 37].
Cochrane reviews of strategies to improve the imple-
mentation of recommended clinical practices suggest
that a variety of both organisational and individually
focused strategies may be effective. These strategies
include leadership, local clinical practice guidelines,
electronic prompt and reminder systems, local opinion
leaders, educational meetings and educational materials,
academic detailing, including audit and feedback, and,
monitoring the performance of the delivery of healthcare
[38–41]. The effectiveness of such strategies in improving
the implementation of guideline recommendations is, how-
e v e r ,h i g h l yv a r i a b l e[ 38–42] and, to maximise effectiveness,
it is recommended that strategies are selected that target
specific barriers to the implementation of recommended
clinical practices [ 43–45]. Implementation frameworks
such as the Theoretical Domains Framework have been
developed to aid the selection of targeted evidence-based
implementation strategies [ 46,47].
No controlled trials have been conducted to test the
effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of implementation
strategies in increasing the provision of recommended
antenatal care that addresses maternal alcohol consump-
tion during pregnancy. Accordingly, the aim of this study
is to examine the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness
of a multi-strategy practice change intervention in increas-
ing maternity clinician provision of care addressing the
consumption of alcohol by women during their pregnancy.
Methods
Study design and setting
The study will be a randomised stepped-wedge controlled
trial design conducted in three sectors (clusters) in the
Hunter New England Local Health District in New South
Wales, Australia. The sectors are geographically defined
groupings of antenatal facilities with common operational
management. As shown in Fig. 1, repeated cross-sectional
outcome data will be gathered on a weekly basis across allthree sectors for the duration of the study (34 months).
Baseline (current practice/ control phase) data will be
collected for each of the three sectors from 7 months
prior to the commencement of the intervention in the
first sector to the start of the intervention in each sector.
Stepped implementation of a 7-month practice change
intervention will be delivered in a randomly selected order
at six monthly intervals. Follow-up data will continue to be
collected for all three sectors 7 months following comple-
tion of the practice change intervention in the third sector.

up periods for the three sectors combined.
A randomised stepped-wedge controlled trial design is
recommended for the evaluation of complex practice
change interventions in settings such as health services
as it provides a number of pragmatic and scientific advan-
tages over a randomised controlled trial design [ 48,49].
First, it provides a similar level of evidence as a standard
parallel cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) [ 50].
Second, although all participants will receive the interven-
tion, its sequential implementation across three sectors
provides the capacity to identify secular trends, i.e. changes
over time before the intervention is implemented [ 48].
Third, the design addresses the practical difficulty of
recruiting the number of similar antenatal services that
would be required for a parallel cluster RCT, instead
allowing each cluster to act as its own control [ 48,49].
Finally, the design provides an opportunity for all partici-
pating services and women to receive the intervention,
overcoming ethical and logistical challenges arising from
withholding the intervention [ 50].
Public antenatal services are the largest provider of
antenatal health care in Australia, providing services to a
diverse population [ 51]. The antenatal services in the three
sectors service urban and rural areas and provide care to
over 6000 women annually, acc ounting for approximately
70% of births in Hunter New England Local Health District
public hospitals [ 52].
Random allocation and blinding
A statistician who is independent of intervention develop-
ment and implementation will randomly allocate the order
in which the intervention is implemented (stepped) across
the three health sectors. The random sequence will be
generated using a computerised random number gener-
ator with allocation undertaken for all three sectors at the
one time. Study personnel involved in collecting outcome
data will be blind to the allocated order of the delivery of
the intervention across the sectors. Participants providing
outcome data will not be informed of the experimental
nature of intervention implementation across services and

in the service they attended. Given the practice changeKingsland et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:112 Page 3 of 14
nature of the intervention, clinicians in antenatal services
will be aware when their service is in the intervention
period.
Participant eligibility and recruitment
Antenatal services and clinicians
All public antenatal services in the three sectors will
receive the practice change intervention, including mid-
wifery group practices, midwifery clinics, specialist
medical services, Aboriginal Maternal Infant Health
Services (AMIHS), and multi-disciplinary teams caring
for women with complex pregnancies or identified
vulnerabilities. The practice change intervention will be
provided to all maternity clinicians providing antenatal
care in participating services: registered midwives (clinical
midwife educators, clinical midwife specialists, clinical
midwife consultants, communit y liaison midwives), medical
practitioners (staff specialists in obstetrics, fellows, regis-
trars, resident medical officer s, general practice obstetri-
cians), Aboriginal health practitioners, Aboriginal health
workers and students. All such clinicians who worked in
participating antenatal services for at least one of the
7 months during which the practice change intervention
was implemented in their sector will be invited to partici-
pate in a post intervention survey.
Pregnant women
It is intended that all pregnant women who attend par-
ticipating services from the start of the practice change
intervention in their health sector will receive the inter-
vention. During the 34-month data collection period,
women who attend an individual face-to-face antenatal
appointment at three time points (i) the time of the first
public antenatal service visit (from this point referred to
as the ‘booking in ’visit), (ii) 27 –28 weeks gestation, or
(iii) 35 –36 weeks gestation, will be eligible to participate
in data collection surveys. To be eligible for participation
in such surveys, women need to: be aged 18 years or
older, be currently pregnant at more than 12 weeksgestation and less than 37 weeks gestation, have a suffi-
cient level of English language proficiency to complete
the survey unaided, and be mentally and physically cap-
able of completing the survey. Women will be ineligible
to participate in data collection surveys if they: are deter-
mined by clinical discretion to be inappropriate to contact
for the survey (e.g. due to medical or social issues); and/or
are receiving the majority of their antenatal care via a pri-
vate obstetrician; and/or have given birth or had a negative
pregnancy outcome; and/or had already been selected to
participate in the survey for that care time point in the
past 4 weeks; and/or had previously declined participation
in the survey. The number of women deemed ineligible
for the above-listed reasons will be recorded and reported.
Each week, a sample of eligible women who attended
an antenatal appointment in the past week (for booking
in, 27 –28 weeks gestation or 35 –36 weeks gestation care)
will be randomly selected via a computerised random
number generator by members of the research team not
involved in delivering care to women. Selected women will
be mailed a participant information statement explaining
the purpose of the survey 1 week prior to receiving a
phone call inviting them to participate in the survey. Study
posters will be displayed in antenatal clinics and pam-
phlets distributed in antenatal information packs provided
to all women at the time of their booking in appointment.
Women identified via the medical record data as being of
Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin and/or women
who are attending or enrolled to attend an AMIHS will be
first contacted by text message and invited to participate.
If they do not respond, they will be followed up with a
telephone call 4 days later. All women will have the
opportunity to decline participation at any point, includ-
ing opting out during the clinic visit or when they receive
information in the antenatal booking in pack, when they
receive the study information letter in the mail, at the time
of the phone call or text message, or partway through sur-
vey completion. On the morning of the day that a woman
is to be contacted via phone call or text message, medical

basis across all three sectors for the duration of the study. Baseline data will be collected for each of the three sectors from 7 months prior to the
commencement of the intervention in the first sector to the start of the intervention in each sector. Stepped implementation of a 7-month

record data will be checked and any women who are
identified as having given birth or having had a negative
pregnancy outcome will be deemed ineligible and not
contacted.
Intervention
Model of care for addressing maternal alcohol consumption
in pregnancy
A model of care for addressing alcohol consumption in
pregnancy will be implemented in antenatal services
across the three participating sectors. The model of care is
consistent with international [ 20] and Australian national
[21,22], and state [ 23,24] antenatal clinical practice
guidelines and is based on models of assessment and brief
intervention that have been shown to reduce the risk of
an alcohol-exposed pregnancy [ 11,13–18].
As shown in Fig. 2, the model of care will consist of
three key elements –assessment, advice and referral, which
will be delivered to women who attend an antenatal clinic
appointment the booking in, 27 –29 weeks gestation and
35–37 weeks gestation.
1) Assessment of alcohol consumption
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Con-
sumption (AUDIT-C) tool will be used to assess thealcohol consumption of pregnant women. The tool has
shown to be a valid tool for use with pregnant women
[53]. Maternity clinicians will ask all women the first
AUDIT-C question: ‘How often do you have a drink
containing alcohol? ’. Those women who provide a response
other than ‘Never ’, will be asked the remaining two
AUDIT-C items: ‘How many standard drinks of alcohol
do you have on a typical day when you are drinking? ’
and ‘How often do you have five or more alcohol drinks
on one occasion? ’. These responses will be used to
calculate an ‘Alcohol Risk Score ’and ‘Alcohol Risk of
Harm ’category (No Risk, Low Risk, Medium Risk,
High Risk).
2) Provision of brief advice
All women, regardless of their Alcohol Risk of Harm
category, will be provided with advice by their maternity
clinician that it is best not to consume alcohol at any
time during pregnancy and that alcohol consumption
during pregnancy can increase risk of harm to the
foetus and the woman. Women will be provided with
additional advice based on their Alcohol Risk of Harm
category.
3) Referral to specialist services for additional support
Fig. 2 Model of care for addressing maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Figure 2 shows the model of care for addressing maternal
alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This model of care will consist of three key elements —assessment, advice and referral —which will be
delivered to women who attend an antenatal clinic appointment booking in, 27 –29 weeks gestation and 35 –37 weeks gestation. The Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption (AUDIT-C) tool will be used to assess the alcohol consumption of pregnant women. All women,
regardless of their Alcohol Risk of Harm category, will be provided with advice by their maternity clinician that it is best not to consume alcohol
at any time during pregnancy and that alcohol consumption during pregnancy can increase risk of harm to the foetus and the woman. Women
will be provided with additional advice based on their Alcohol Risk of Harm category. Women with a Medium AUDIT-C risk level will be offered a
referral to the Get Healthy in Pregnancy telephone-based coaching service. Aboriginal women with a Medium AUDIT-C risk level will also be
offered the option of referral to counselling services at a local Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service (ACCHS) (if available). For women
with a High AUDIT-C risk level, direct referral to Hunter New England Local Health District Drug and Alcohol Clinical Services will be provided.
Care from such services will involve ongoing clinical support from a multidisciplinary Drug and Alcohol team throughout pregnancy, including
assessment, brief intervention, counselling and withdrawal and post-withdrawal support as clinically indicatedKingsland et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:112 Page 5 of 14
Women with a Medium AUDIT-C risk level will be
offered a referral to the Get Healthy in Pregnancy tele-
phone-based coaching service. Get Healthy in Pregnancy is
a free, state-wide, government-funded telephone coaching
service that supports women to make positive health and
lifestyle changes [ 54]. Women can set a goal of alcohol
abstinence throughout pregnancy and receive up to ten
tailored calls by qualified health coaches. The coaching
is based on behaviour change principles designed to assist
with goal setting, maintaining motivation and overcoming
barriers [ 54]. Aboriginal women with a Medium AUDIT-C
risk level will also be offered the option of referral to
counselling services at a local Aboriginal Community
Controlled Health Service (ACCHS) (if available). This
latter referral pathway was established through consultation
with Aboriginal community members and the ACCHS ’s
that provide care for Aboriginal pregnant women in the
study region.
For women with a High AUDIT-C risk level, direct
referral to Hunter New England Local Health District
Drug and Alcohol Clinical Services will be provided. Care
from such services will involve ongoing clinical support
from a multidisciplinary Drug and Alcohol team through-
out pregnancy, including assessment, brief intervention,
counselling and withdrawal and post-withdrawal support
as clinically indicated. Referral may also be made to resi-
dential drug and alcohol treatment services if required
(provided by non-government services).
Implementation intervention
A series of organisational and individual clinician focused
strategies will be used to support clinician implementation
of the model of care.
Implementation intervention strategy development
The following staged process was undertaken to develop
the implementation strategies:
1. Quantitative anonymous surveys were undertaken
with 33 clinicians working in antenatal services
across the three sectors and an additional eight
managers of maternity services/teams to determine
perceived barriers and enablers to their
implementation of the model of care for addressing
maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
The surveys were constructed based on 11 domains of
the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [ 55,56]
and were informed by previous surveys of health
professionals [ 57] and previous studies utilising the
TDF across different health care settings [ 58–60].
2. The priority barriers identified through the clinician
and manager surveys were mapped to TDF
techniques for behaviour change [ 43] and a
proposed list of implementation strategies wasdeveloped based on a review of the literature and
advice sought from experts in treatment of alcohol
harms, clinical practice change, health service
research and behavioural sciences.
3. Consultation with Aboriginal community members,
ACCHSs within the participating sectors, AMIHS
staff, and Aboriginal population health staff was
undertaken to ensure the content of
implementation strategies was culturally
appropriate for women. Qualitative research (focus
groups) was also conducted with Aboriginal
mothers (who had attended a public antenatal
service in the study region in the last 12 months)
and Aboriginal pregnant women to explore
experiences of antenatal care in relation to the
consumption of alcohol during pregnancy and
identify any issues relating to the provision of such
care to ensure the implementation strategies were
culturally appropriate.
4. Final refinement of implementation strategies and
development of strategy content was undertaken
following consultation with key clinicians and
managers across the three participating health
sectors.
Implementation intervention strategies Table 1lists
the implementation strategies that will be used to support
the introduction of the model of care for addressing
maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Fig. 2),
including the evidence source and the TDF domains on
which each strategy was based and the barriers that the
strategy was intended to address.
Implementation intervention delivery timeline The
intervention strategies listed above will be implemented in
each sector for 7 months prior to follow up data collection
(Fig. 1). This will include a 1-month period introducing
the practice change and a 6-month intensive practice
change intervention. Given their organisational and sys-
tem focus, all strategies, other than the local opinion
leader (Clinical Midwife Educator (CME)) and academic
detailing strategies, have the potential to continue to be
implemented following the 7-month study intervention
period, subject to the operational decisions of the Local
Health District.
Control and contamination
Usual care
Prior to implementation of the practice change interven-
tion in each of the three sectors, usual antenatal care for
addressing maternal alcohol c onsumption during pregnancy
will be provided. Such care is likely to vary by antenatal ser-
vice and clinician as no existing health sector-wide guidelineKingsland et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:112 Page 6 of 14

or procedure specifies the p rovision of routine care for
addressing alcohol consu mption during pregnancy.
Potential for contamination
As the research team will control the initiation and delivery
of all the intervention elements, the intervention strategies
will not be accessible to antenatal clinicians during the
baseline (control) phase. Although potential for contamin-
ation during this phase from staff movement between
sectors is possible, it is considered to be limited due to
the structural and systemic nature of the implementation
strategies. Information on movement of clinicians between
participating sectors will be collected throughout the
study.
Measures
Primary trial outcomes
There are four primary outcomes for this trial. They are
the proportion of all antenatal clinic appointments (at
‘booking in ’, 27-28 weeks gestation and 35 –36 weeks
gestation) for which women report:
1. Being assessed for alcohol consumption and level of
risk using the AUDIT-C.
2. Being provided with brief advice related to alcohol
consumption during pregnancy.
3. Receiving, relative to their level of risk, the relevant
elements of antenatal care for addressing alcohol
consumption during pregnancy (advise and refer).
4. Being assessed for alcohol consumption and level of
risk using the AUDIT-C and receiving, relative to
their level of risk, the relevant elements of antenatal
care for addressing alcohol consumption during
pregnancy (advise and refer).
Secondary trial outcome
For women attending antenatal appointments at ‘booking
in’,2 7 –28 weeks gestation and 35 –36 weeks gestation, alco-
hol consumption since pregnancy recognition as measured
by total AUDIT-C score will be collected based on self-re-
port of women. AUDIT-C is a validated tool for assessing
risk of harm due to alcohol consumption [ 53].
Process evaluation measures
The acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, intervention
fidelity and reach of the model of care for addressing
maternal alcohol consumption in pregnancy and the
implementation strategies will be assessed via surveys
of women and clinicians and project records. These
process measures will be based on an implementation
evaluation framework [ 61] and use validated measures
where available [ 62]. Measures to assess implementation
intervention reach will include participation of antenatal
clinical staff in educational meetings, interaction with localopinion leaders, involvement in academic detailing/ audit
and feedback sessions, and receipts of clinical practice
guidelines. To determine reach of the implementation
intervention strategies across different groups of clini-
cians, data will be collected from clinicians on position/
profession, level of training, and length of time working
in current antenatal service and in antenatal services
generally. To assess delivery of the model of care across
different demographic groups of women, the following
information will be collected from pregnant women: age,
gender, highest level of education, employment status,
geographical location, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander
status of woman and baby, household composition, current
gestation, gestation at first antenatal clinic visit, whether
attending care for first or subsequent pregnancy and
alcohol consumption prior pregnancy (via AUDIT-C).
Cost and cost-effectiveness
To provide a measure of the investment required to develop,
implement and maintain the effect of the implementation
strategies, resource use will be prospectively measured and
valued from a public finance perspective. The outcomes
from the cost analysis will be (i) an estimate of the cost
required to develop the intervention strategies, (ii) the
net cost of delivering the implementation intervention
(including labour costs for the CME and the clinicians
to conduct/participate in each of the implementation
strategies, undertaking quality assurance processes, pro-
viding managerial oversight), and (iii) assuming a positive
trial outcome, the expected incremental cost to maintain
effect. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of the imple-
mentation strategies will be assessed relative to the base-
line (current practice) phase in each of the three sectors.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be
calculated as the difference in average cost between the
intervention and baseline phases, divided by the difference
in the primary outcome. Sensitivity analyses will test the
robustness of results to selected issues and assumptions.
Data collection procedures
Primary and secondary outcome measures
Each week a sample of women who in the past week
attended an antenatal clinic for a ‘booking in ’visit, a visit
when they were 27 –28 weeks gestation, or a visit when
they were 35 –36 weeks gestation will be sent a letter
providing information about the study and inviting them
to participate in a computer assisted telephone interview
(CATI) survey. Telephone contact will be attempted
with women up to ten times over a 2-week period, in-
cluding at different times of the day and on weekdays
and weekends, in order to elicit consent and completion
of the survey. If a woman declines to participate in the
CATI, they will be invited to complete the survey online.
If they consent to participate in the online survey, theyKingsland et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:112 Page 10 of 14
will be sent a survey link via text message. Women who
are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin and/or
are attending or enrolled to attend an AMIHS will be
offered via text message the choice of participating in
the survey via either CATI or online mode.
The CATI survey will be conducted by experienced
female interviewers who will receive specific training
and undertake practice interviews. The CATI and online
survey script are identical in the wording of questions,
response options and help provided. Both surveys will
be pilot tested prior to starting the study to test compre-
hension, logic flow and survey length.
Process evaluation
Data for the aforementioned process evaluation measures
will be collected via surveys with women (as per procedure
described above) and clinicians. Online surveys of clinicians
will be conducted at the completion of the intervention in
each sector. All eligible clinicians in antenatal services
in the participating sectors will be sent a link to an online
survey via email, and also given the option to complete the
survey on tablet computers/laptops in regular in-services
and clinic meetings. Surveys will be completed anonym-
ously. Additional process data to assess intervention fidelity
and reach will be collected us ing project management logs
completed by project staff.
Cost and cost effectiveness
Project management logs, including a cost capture tem-
plate, will be used to prospectively collect data regarding
the resources expended during intervention development
and implementation.
Overall data management
Management of trial data will be in accordance with a
data management protocol, which has been developed
and approved by the project ’s advisory group. Data will
be stored securely as per the requirements of the Hunter
New England Human Research Ethics Committee, The
University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee
and the Aboriginal Health an d Medical Research Council.
Data will only be accessible to primary researchers and
statisticians. Confidential pa rticipant data will be stored
securely and not linked to survey responses.
Sample size and power calculations
It is expected that 70% of invited women will consent to
participate in the surveys (based on previous work by
the research team [ 63]). Assuming 48 working weeks a
year, and an intra-class correlation of 0.01, a sample of
200 women per month (approximately 67 women per each
of the three time points: booking in visit, 27 –28 weeks
gestation, 35 –36 weeks gestation) will give the study 80%
power to detect an absolute increase in care provision of15% in the intervention period (based on a conservative
50% estimate of prevalence of care provision at baseline) in
at least one of the four primary outcomes at a 1.25%
significance threshold. Assuming there are approximately
190 women eligible per week, a weekly sample of 72
women (i.e. 24 women per time point) with a 70% survey
completion rate ( n= 50) will result in the required number
of women needed per month.
Statistical analysis
Baseline and follow-up primary outcomes data will be
analysed using a logistic mixed model to detect change
over time in the reported receipt of recommended antenatal
care for addressing alcohol con sumption during pregnancy.
For the secondary trial outcome, linear mixed models will
be used to analyse changes in AUDIT-C scores of partici-
pants between baselines and follow up periods. The models
will have a period term (fixed effect, reflecting pre-post
difference, the main indicator of effect) and health sector
term (fixed effect). Where appropriate, the models will also
include fixed effects for client group (booking in, 27 –
28 weeks gestation, 35 –36 weeks gestation) and a time term
(fixed effect, to pick up any secular trend). In the latter
models, a client group by period term will detect differences
between the client groups in their response to the interven-
tion. Where the interaction ter ms are significant, subgroup
analyses will be reported for each of the three client groups.
Descriptive statistics will be used to report on process
measures and interventions costs. Process outcomes
will be used to narratively interpret the results of primary
outcome analysis. SAS (V9.3 or later) will be used for all
statistical analyses.
Research trial governance
A research co-production approach has been employed
in the development and design of the study [ 64]. The
conduct of the study will similarly be overseen by an
advisory group consisting of researchers, policy makers,
practitioners and clinical experts with expertise related
to alcohol, health promotion, implementation science,
FASD, obstetrics and maternal health. A project team
consisting of research staff and practitioners will develop
and operationalise implementation strategies and data
collection components of the trial according to study
protocol. Local clinical experts based at each of the three
participating sectors will provide advice on aspects of the
model of care and implementation strategies that require
sector-specific tailoring.
Aboriginal cultural governance
A series of Aboriginal cultural governance task groups,
co-led by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal staff, will provide
guidance on cultural considerations for Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander people relating to the model of care,Kingsland et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:112 Page 11 of 14
implementation strategies, data collection, and interpret-
ation and dissemination of study findings.
Trial discontinuation or modification
There are no criteria for trial discontinuation as it is not
anticipated that any events would occur that would warrant
discontinuing the trial. Any unforeseen adverse events will
be reported to the Hunter New England Human Research
Ethics Committee (primary approval committee) and ad-
vice sought regarding required action. The trial registration
record will be updated with any protocol modifications and
any deviations from original protocol will be reported in
study outcome papers.
Discussion
Despite the need, there is a clear absence of research
evidence of the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of
implementation strategies to improve antenatal care that
addresses maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate
the effectiveness of such intervention strategies. The
stepped-wedge design is feasible and acceptable in the
context of conducting a trial across multiple antenatal
services. The study has strong design elements including
random allocation of the order of strategy implementation
across the health sectors and blinding of data collection
staff. The implementation intervention strategies have
been developed based on key implementation science
frameworks and using data from surveys with antenatal
services staff and managers. A research co-production
approach has been employed in the design of the study
and will be employed in its conduct and dissemination.
If positive changes in clinical practice are found, the
study will provide evidence to support the delivery by
health services of the implementation strategies to improve
antenatal care addressing this recognised risk to the health
and wellbeing of both the mother and child. The methods
used in this trial have the potential to provide a framework
for the development of initiatives for improving the imple-
mentation of models of care, both in the antenatal clinic
setting and in other clinical environments.
