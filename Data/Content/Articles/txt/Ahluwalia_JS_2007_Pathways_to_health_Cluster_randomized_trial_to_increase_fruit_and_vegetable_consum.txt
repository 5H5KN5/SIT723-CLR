Objectives: Examine the effectiveness of an intervention to increase fruits and vegetables (FV) con-
sumption among smokers. Design: Cluster-randomized trial of 20 public housing developments; 10
randomly assigned to an FV intervention and 10 to a smoking cessation intervention. Main outcome
measures: Usual (past 7 days) and past 30 days change in daily FV intake at 8 weeks and 6 months
postbaseline. Results: Greater increases were seen in the FV group. At Week 8 and Month 6, the FV
group had consumed 1.58 ( p/H11021.001) and 0.78 ( p/H11005.04), respectively, more daily FV servings in the
past 7 days than the cessation group. At the same time points, the FV group had consumed 3.61 ( p/H11005
.01) and 3.93 ( p/H11005.01), respectively, more FV servings in the past 30 days than the cessation group.
Completing more motivational interviewing sessions ( p/H11005.02) and trying more recipes ( p/H11005.02) led to
significantly greater increases at Month 6 among FV participants. Conclusions: Motivational interview-
ing counseling and lifestyle modification through trying out healthy recipes may be effective in helpinga high-risk population increase their FV intake.

Together, poor dietary patterns and a sedentary lifestyle account
for approximately 365,000 deaths per year, ranking second only totobacco use as a primary cause of preventable death (Mokdad,Marks, Stroup, & Gerberding, 2005). On the basis of a conver-gence of evidence indicating that a diet high in fruits and vegeta-bles (FV) is associated with lower risks for numerous chronicdiseases, including several cancers, cardiovascular disease, andstroke (Hung et al., 2004), increasing Americans’ intake of FV hasbecome a national health priority (R. M. Davis, 1998). In 1991, theNational Cancer Institute established the nationa l 5 A Day for
Better Health Program (Heimendinger, Van Duyn, Chapelsky,Foerster, & Stables, 1996); however, prevalence data indicatedlittle change in the frequency of FV consumption among adults inthe United States between 1994 and 2000 (Serdula et al., 2004).Furthermore, in 2000 only 24.6% of adults consumed the recom-mended 5–9 servings of FV a day (recommendations vary on thebasis of age, gender, and activity level), with the mean frequencyof consumption being 3.37 times per day (Serdula et al., 2004).Although many guidelines (e.g., the Food Guide Pyramid) pro-
vide recommendations for a healthy diet, limited information isavailable on the effectiveness of dietary interventions and the beststrategies for achieving meaningful change among underservedand at risk segments of the population (Ammerman, Lindquist,
Lohr, & Hersey, 2002). Individuals in such groups have the highestprevalence rates for many cancers and chronic diseases that maybe linked with diet but are the least frequently reached by preven-tion programs (Kumanyika, 1990). Individuals living in povertyare at increased risk for poorer dietary habits and diet quality. Asthe majority of Americans consume less than the recommended 5servings of FV per day, those making less than $15,000 per year orhaving less than a high school education are at greatest risk forinadequate consumption (Serdula et al., 2004). Smokers are also atrisk. Current smokers eat less FV and are at increased risk forchronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer,thought to be linked to diet and, therefore, may derive additionalhealth benefits from increasing their consumption of FV (Hung etal., 2004).
A cluster-randomized dual intervention trial titled Pathways to
Health (PATH) was conducted among smokers residing in public
and Section 8 housing developments (HDs). The primary purposeof the PATH study was to test the effects of nicotine gum alongwith motivational interviewing (MI) counseling for smoking ces-sation (Okuyemi, James, Mayo, Nollen, & Ahluwalia, in press). Adietary, as opposed to a placebo-controlled, intervention was usedas the comparison group for the smoking cessation arm. Thedietary intervention served as an attention control and was selectedto fill a need for more information about dietary interventions inimpoverished populations, to ensure community buy-in, and toaddress residents’ potential distrust about being part of a “drug”study with a placebo arm. HDs were selected because of the knownhealth disparities existing among impoverished and underserved

communities and because by intervening directly in the HD com-
munity we were able to reduce key obstacles of access and avail-ability that often impede this population’s participation in healthpromotion programs. The present study describes the dietary in-tervention used in the PATH project and its impact on FV con-sumption among smokers residing in public housing.
Method
Participants and Randomization
Study design, methods, and inclusion/exclusion criteria have been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (Jeffries, Choi, Butler, Harris, & Ahluwalia, inpress; Okuyemi et al., in press). In brief, this study was a cluster-randomized trial in which 20 public and Section 8 HDs, funded by the U.S.Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide low-income housing for families meeting federal poverty guidelines (U.S.Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2005), were randomlyassigned to a fruit and vegetable (FV) or smoking cessation intervention.All HD residents were invited to attend a community health fair held attheir development. Health fairs served as the vehicles to recruit smokers.Health fair attendees completed a questionnaire assessing smoking status.From this, smokers were identified for potential inclusion in the random-ized trial.
All participants provided written informed consent. The trial procedures
were approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center’s humansubjects committee. Randomization occurred at the group level, with 10HDs being randomized to the FV arm and 10 HDs being randomized to thesmoking cessation arm at the conclusion of each health fair. Because ageis associated with key smoking variables, HDs were stratified by elderlyversus nonelderly (i.e., “family”) developments, as determined by theKansas City Kansas and Missouri Housing Authorities, and block random-ization of size four occurred within each stratum. Treatment assignmentwas revealed to the study coordinator and research staff only after eachhealth fair was complete. Sequential enrollment continued until 20 HDswere randomized, of which 10 were randomized to the smoking cessationarm and 10 to the comparison arm. Recruitment occurred between October2001 and May 2003; participants were followed for 6 months.
Intervention Components
Week 0 appointments were completed within 10 days of the health fair.
Participants in the dietary arm received a bag of fresh FV, a cookbook ofhealthy recipes, dietary education materials, and two videos on FV. Par-ticipants in the smoking cessation arm received an 8-week supply of 4-mgnicotine gum, instructions for using the gum, and educational materialsrelated to quitting. Participants in both arms received five sessions of MIcounseling for FV consumption or smoking cessation (on the basis ofgroup assignment), conducted onsite at the HDs at Weeks 0 and 3 and viatelephone at Day 10 and Weeks 5 and 20 by trained master’s level staff.
A number of theoretical models guided the selection of these interven-
tion components. Social cognitive theory posits that self-efficacy (anindividual’s belief in his or her ability to make a change) and outcomeexpectations (belief that making a change will lead to a desired outcome)are important determinants of health behavior change (Maibach & Cotton,1995). Studies relating these constructs to FV intake have found thatindividuals with low self-efficacy (i.e., not confident in their ability toincrease their FV) and/or low outcome expectations (i.e., don’t believeincreasing their FV will lead to a desired outcome) are less likely to changetheir FV consumption (Steptoe, Perkins-Porras, Rink, Hilton, & Cappuc-cio, 2004). Similarly, improvements in self-efficacy have been found tolead to increased FV consumption. Following from these findings, thedietary educational materials, cookbook, and MI counseling were designedto enhance self-efficacy and improve outcome expectations. Specific in-formation designed to increase self-efficacy included discussions of moti-
vation and confidence to change, suggestions for addressing barriers to FVconsumption, tips on preparing and storing FV, and suggestions regardingcooking healthfully, making low fat substitutions, and incorporating moreFV into one’s diet. Information designed to enhance outcome expectationsincluded discussions related to the nutritional value and health benefits ofcommonly available FV.
The health belief model suggests that behavior change is most likely to
occur when an individual believes he or she is at risk (perceived suscep-tibility), that the consequences are serious (perceived severity), and that thebenefits (perceived benefits) outweigh the barriers (perceived barriers;Becker, 1977). Individuals who perceive risks related to their consumptionof FV and believe the pros of change (i.e., benefits) outweigh the cons (i.e.,barriers) are more likely to increase their FV consumption (Steptoe et al.,2004). Following from these findings, a portion of each MI session focusedon a decisional balance activity in which the benefits and barriers toincreasing FV consumption were explored. A values exploration exercise
also encouraged participants to consider the reason for and risks andconsequences of maintaining their current level of intake.
Finally, our awareness of and attention to the culture of our study sample
was guided by the two-dimensional model of cultural sensitivity in publichealth (Resnicow, Soler, Braithwaite, Ahluwalia, & Butler, 2000). Surface
structures were incorporated through the educational materials that fea-
tured predominantly African American images and graphics and the cook-book and bag of FV, which incorporated recipes and foods common amongthe predominately African American sample. Deep structures were incor-
porated through the print materials and counseling that addressed uniquebarriers (i.e., poverty and dietary preferences) and core cultural values (i.e.,religion/spiritualism, collectivism, and family) of our study sample.
Bag of fresh FV. Participants were recruited between October 2001
and May 2003. Although seasonality impacted the availability and inclu-sion of some fruits and vegetables at different times throughout the year,bags typically included a mix of fruits (e.g., apples, oranges, bananas,grapes) and vegetables (e.g., collard greens, carrots, bell peppers, broccoli,and cauliflower) common to our primarily African American population. Inaddition, bags typically contained one potentially less familiar item such asa mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, or eggplant. Approximately $8–$10was spent on each bag.
FV educational materials. The FV educational materials were created
by a registered dietician on the basis of existing materials from theAmerican Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute. The materialsincluded information on serving size, the nutritional value and healthbenefits of commonly available FV, suggestions for addressing barriers toFV consumption, tips on preparing and storing FV, and suggestions re-garding cooking healthy, making low fat substitutions, and incorporatingmore FV into one’s diet.
A Pathways to Health cookbook was created on the basis of existing
materials designed for ethnic minority populations (Resnicow et al., 2001).For inclusion, recipes had to include FV. Fat and calorie content was alsoconsidered. Recipes were selected to reflect foods common among ourpredominately African American sample.
The two videos we provided participants, Beating the Budget Blues and
Meal Appeal , were modified from the Bringing it Home video series, a
previous National Cancer Institute-funded intervention that explored theeffectiveness of schoolchildren (4th graders) as change agents to increasefruit, juice, and vegetable consumption among lower income AfricanAmerican parents (M. Davis et al., 2000). Beating the Budget Blues
addressed how to buy FV on a budget, whereas Meal Appeal provided tips
for eating FV at every meal and snack. The original video series containedall African American actors and actresses. Given that the present study wasnot limited to African Americans, we had scenes from each video reshotwith a Caucasian actor or actress to more accurately represent the ethnicmakeup of our study sample. Scenes were reshot by Hall Foushee Com-215 PATHWAYS TO HEALTH

MI. MI, described in detail elsewhere (Miller & Rollnick, 2002), is a
counseling approach originally developed for addictive behaviors that hasmore recently been applied to other health behaviors, including smokingcessation (Butler, Rollnick, Russell, Bachmann, & Stott, 1999) and FVconsumption (Resnicow et al., 2001). In the present study, MI was con-ducted by trained counselors following semistructured counseling scripts.Generally, participants received counseling from the same person for allfive sessions. Sessions, conducted at Week 0, Day 10, and Weeks 3, 5, and20, explored the positive and negative aspects of increasing FV consump-tion, the pros and cons for change, participants’ ambivalence about in-creasing FV consumption, motivation and confidence for increasing FVconsumption, and plans for change. A values clarification strategy, basedon the work of Miller and Rollnick (2002), was also used. Participants wereasked to identify key values and attributes and explore potential connec-tions between their diet and their ability to live out these values. Alterna-tively, participants were encouraged to consider how changing their dietmight be related to their core values and attributes. To maximize thefidelity and integrity of the MI session, we audiotaped all counselingsessions (telephone and in person). A subset of audiotapes was rated bydoctoral level psychologists for MI adherence with a modified version ofthe Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (Moyers, Martin, Catley, Harris,& Ahluwalia, 2003). Counselors received ongoing supervision for theduration of the trial and met weekly with supervisors to review audiotapesand discuss current issues.
Recruitment and Retention
The recruitment strategies used to promote and encourage attendance at
the health fairs are described elsewhere (Jeffries et al., in press). For thetrial, reminder phone calls and postcards were used between visits tominimize attrition. All participants who missed their appointment werecalled up to six times to reschedule their visit. To further enhance retention,participants received incentives at every visit (e.g., movie tickets, T-shirt,water bottle, or tote bag) and were compensated in Wal-Mart vouchersduring the 6-month follow-up period: $40 at the health fair, $40 at Week8, and $40 at Month 6.
Measures
Demographic characteristics. The baseline assessment included mea-
sures of demographics, health status, and smoking behaviors.
Outcome variables. The primary FV outcomes included change from
baseline in daily FV intake. Two measures of FV intake were obtained atbaseline, Week 8, and Month 6 to provide a measure of usual (past 7 days)and past month consumption. One was a 2-question measure adapted fromthe Health Habits and History Questionnaire (Block, Thompson, Hartman,Larkin, & Guire, 1992) that asked, “Over the past 7 days, how many timesper day or week did you eat fruit, not including vegetables?” and “Over thepast 7 days, how many times per day or week did you eat vegetables, notincluding fruit?” A follow-up question asked if this was times per day orper week. Items were summed to derive an index of daily FV intake. Thesecond was the National Cancer Institute 19-item FV food frequencyquestionnaire, which assesses frequency and portion size estimates of FVconsumption over the last 30 days (Thompson et al., 2002). The 2 items (1frequency and 1 portion size) assessing french fry intake were excludedfrom the present analyses. Additionally, the question about consumption ofmixtures that included vegetables is not included in the scoring algorithm,leaving 16 items. Because of the exclusion of these 3 items, this instrumentwill be referred to as a 16-item measure for the remainder of the article.
Other variables of interest included change from baseline in body mass
index (BMI) at Week 8 and Month 6 and the percentage of participantsconsuming at least five servings of FV per day in the last 7 (2-itemmeasure) and 30 days (16-item measure). BMI was calculated from height
and weight measured during the health fair. Height was measured withoutsocks or shoes by using a portable stadiometer and rounded to the nearest0.1 in. Weight was measured by using the Tanita bioimpedance machine(TBF-310 and TBF-300; Tanita Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL). Toaccount for clothing, we adjusted participants’ weight downward by 2pounds and measured to the nearest 0.1 pound. Overweight was defined asBMI/H1135025 kg/m
2.
Process and compliance. Process and compliance evaluations were
conducted at Week 8 and Month 6. Participants in the FV arm were askedabout their consumption of the bag of FV they were given at randomiza-tion; their use of the cookbook, videos, and educational materials; theperceived benefit of these materials; and overall satisfaction with thePATH program. The percentage of MI counseling completed at each visit,along with the total percentage of the sample completing 0–5 MI sessions,was also explored.
Data Management
All forms were completed by study staff and reviewed by a study
coordinator. Following double data entry, comparison, logic, range, andedit checks were performed. After resolution of discrepancies and com-pletion of all data checks, a final Access and SAS database was created andlocked.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical power was based on the main outcome of the larger trial—
smoking cessation—and was assessed over a range of potential intraclasscorrelation coefficients. Categorical baseline variables were summarizedby frequencies and percentages, and quantitative variables were summa-rized by mean and standard deviation for each treatment group. Allstatistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Changesfrom baseline in daily FV intake and BMI were computed, summarized,and compared across groups for all 173 participants, imputing no changefor those who were lost to follow-up. Mixed linear models, assuming acompound symmetric correlation for estimating the intraclass correlationwithin each housing development, were used to compare the change in FVintake between the two groups. Means, standard deviations, and pvalues
summarized the changes from baseline in daily FV intake and BMI atWeek 8 and Month 6.
Results
Sample Description
A total of 20 HDs participated, with 10 randomized to the
cessation arm and 10 to the FV arm. HD size ranged from 82 to397 adult residents. On average, 21% of adult residents attendedthe health fair (range /H110058%–66%). Of the 813 health fair attend-
ees, 273 smokers were identified and screened, 204 met screeningcriteria, and 173 smokers were randomized, 107 to the FV arm and66 to the cessation arm (see Figure 1). Baseline characteristics atthe cluster and individual level are presented in Table 1.
Of the 173 participants, 151 (87.3%) attended their Week 8 visit
and 131 (75.8%) their Month 6 visit. There was no difference inthe rate of missing data at Week 8 ( p/H11005.22) or Month 6 ( p/H11005.28)
between groups. No differences were found in baseline FV con-sumption between those lost to follow-up (2-item: M/H110051.83,
SD/H110051.36; 16-item: M/H110058.04, SD/H110057.50) and those who
returned at Month 6 (2-item: M/H110052.19, SD/H110051.77, p/H11005.17;
16-item: M/H110057.85, SD/H110056.76, p/H11005.97).216 AHLUWALIA ET AL.

Outcome Measures
Participants in the FV group had significantly greater increases
in FV consumption than those in the cessation group (Table 2). At8 weeks and 6 months postbaseline, respectively, the increase inFVs in the last 7 days (2-item measure) reported by the interven-tion group was 1.58 ( p/H11021.001) and 0.78 ( p/H11005.04) servings greater
than the increase reported in the cessation group. In the past 30days (16-item measure), the Week 8 and Month 6 increases re-ported by the intervention group were 3.61 ( p/H11005.01) and 3.93
(p/H11005.01) servings greater than the increases reported in the
cessation group. Significant correlations were found between the20 developments approached and assessed for eligibility

and Month 6, 0.19 (Week 8) and 0.16 (Month 6) servings per day
were due to fruit consumption. A similar trend was found on the16-item measure in the FV group. Fruit increased by 2.48 (Week8) and 1.68 (Month 6) servings, whereas vegetables increased by1.84 (Week 8) and 0.81 (Month 6). In the cessation group, vege-tables increased more than fruit at Week 8 (0.76 for vegetables vs.0.24 for fruits), whereas a decrease was seen in both fruit (–0.31)and vegetables (–0.22) at Month 6.
At baseline, 10.3% in the FV group and 9.1% in the cessation
group ( p/H11005.69) were consuming at least five servings of FV per
day for the prior 7 days (2-item measure). This percentage in-creased to 34.6% versus 19.7% ( p/H11005.06) at Week 8 and 20.6%
versus 16.7% ( p/H11005.53) at Month 6. In the past 30 days (16-item
measure), 49.5% in the FV group and 56.1% in the cessation group(p/H11005.43) were consuming at least five servings of FV per day at
baseline. This percentage increased to 71.7% versus 57.6% ( p/H11005
.06) at Week 8 and 68.2% versus 47.0% ( p/H11021.01) at Month 6. No
group differences in BMI were observed.
Process Evaluation
Use of program materials. At Day 10, 72% reported eating
most or all of the fruit given to them at Week 0, whereas 66%reported eating most or all of the vegetables. At Month 6, 69.2%of participants reported reading at least some of the educational
materials found in the cookbook and trying a mean of 2.07 (2.42)recipes. Over half (65.3%) watched some portion of the videos,whereas the majority (72.0%) read some to all of the educationalmaterials in the program folder.
Overall in the FV group, all participants received at least one MI
session, with the majority (71.0%) receiving four or five sessions.In the cessation group, all participants received at least one MIsession and the majority (60.6%) received four or five sessions.
Among participants in the FV arm, those who completed more
MI sessions ( p/H11005.02) and tried more recipes ( p/H11005.02) exhibited
significantly greater changes in FV intake at Month 6. No otherprogram components were found to be significant for FV con-sumption at Month 6. The extent of dietary change according tolevel of participation in each of the FV intervention components ispresented in Table 3.
Program satisfaction. The majority (72.0%) reported being
very satisfied with the FV intervention and believed that theprogram had a lot of influence in getting them to eat more FV(68.2%). With regard to the perceived benefit of specific pro-gram components, 43.0%, 40.2%, and 37.4% of participantsthought the cookbook, videos, and educational materials, re-
spectively, were very helpful in getting them to eat more FV.Participants were very satisfied with their MI counselorTable 3

Discussion
This randomized trial indicates that a multicomponent interven-
tion, and in particular MI counseling and lifestyle modificationthrough a cookbook of healthy recipes, may be an importantfacilitator of dietary change among public housing residents. Ac-cording to the 2-item measure, the intervention produced a 1.05servings-per-day increase at Month 6 among those in the FV arm,which was significantly greater then the 0.27 servings-per-dayincrease at Month 6 among participants in the cessation arm. Thenet difference of 0.78 servings per day at Month 6 is consistentwith previous studies conducted in low-income and/or AfricanAmerican communities, in which dietary interventions have re-sulted in FV increases ranging from 0.40 to 1.2 servings per day(Campbell et al., 1999; Resnicow et al., 2004). Our sample isdifferent from previous trials in that we focused exclusively onsmokers residing in public housing. Compared with past or neversmokers, current smokers have been found to eat less FV and areat increased risk for chronic diseases, including cardiovasculardisease and cancer thought to be linked to diet (Hung et al., 2004).Smokers may, therefore, derive additional health benefits fromincreasing their consumption of FV.
Although findings from the 16-item measure also indicate sig-
nificantly greater increases in FV consumption among participantsin the FV group, it is important to note the difference in estimatesprovided by the 2- and 16-item measures. The larger estimatesprovided by the 16-item measure are consistent with previousstudies, which have found that food frequency questionnairescontaining a greater number of items or with greater specificity(i.e., portion size) produce higher estimates of intake (Kim &Holowaty, 2003). Additionally, the 2-item instrument measuredaverage intake in the past 7 days, whereas the 16-item instrumentmeasured average intake in the past 30 days. These differences inrecall time frame may also partially account for the disparateestimates obtained via the two measures. We are unable to drawany conclusions comparing the 2- versus the 16-item measure asthis study was not designed to assess the validity of these instru-ments against more detailed dietary assessments (i.e., diet diaries,24-hr dietary recalls) or biological markers (i.e., serum carote-noids). The consistent findings across the measures do, however,provide evidence of the intervention’s effect on usual (i.e., 7 day)and past month (i.e., 30 day) FV consumption.
The potential public health impact of our findings is difficult to
quantify. It has been estimated that a 0.5 serving-size increase indaily FV consumption would translate into an 8% lower incidenceof cancer (Potter, 1997), whereas a one serving-per-day increase inFV would lower cardiovascular disease risk by 6%–11% (Hung etal., 2004). These findings are more pronounced among smokers,for whom greater FV consumption is associated with a 20% lowerrisk of cardiovascular disease among current smokers, and a oneserving-per-day increase in cruciferous vegetables is associatedwith a 45% lower risk of cancer among male current smokers.Drawing from these findings, it can be reasonably concluded thatmaintaining the approximately one serving-per-day increase seenat Month 6 among participants in the FV arm may positivelyimpact long-term health outcomes of this population. Consideredwithin the context of the disproportionately higher rates of cardio-
vascular disease and cancer found among low-income and minor-ity populations (Kumanyika, 1990), the public health impact ofthis finding should not be overlooked. It is important to note,however, that the strongest evidence for a protective effect againstchronic disease involves vegetables (Hung et al., 2004). Consistentwith others (Campbell et al., 1999; Resnicow et al., 2004), thisstudy was more successful in increasing fruit intake than vegetableintake. Future studies are needed to determine strategies to effec-tively increase the consumption of vegetables. Not surprisingly,increasing FV had no impact on BMI over 6 months, suggestingthat modifying FV alone is not enough to alter weight status andthat interventions addressing both diet and activity are warranted.
Our findings provide insight into the design of dietary interven-
tions among public housing residents. Partnering with housingauthorities and implementing the intervention at the HDs mini-mized attrition (76% completed their Month 6 visit). Although theintervention involved multiple components, participants who com-pleted more MI sessions and tried more recipes exhibited signifi-cantly greater changes in FV consumption, whereas the video,educational materials and bag of FV had no impact. These findings
suggest that MI counseling and lifestyle modification through acookbook of healthy recipes may be important facilitators ofdietary change among public housing residents. More research isneeded to determine other individual (e.g., age, gender) and psy-chosocial (e.g., motivation, confidence, self-efficacy) factors pre-dictive of compliance with dietary interventions and protocols.
Several limitations should be noted. Our findings are based on
a comparison group of smokers receiving a dietary intervention asan attention control in a smoking cessation trial who were recruitedfrom health fairs at their HD. Our results, therefore, may reflectself-selection bias, and the external validity of our findings islimited by the fact that participants were not representative of theentire HD community. The assessment of FV consumption isbased on self-report and is, therefore, subject to response and recallbias; however, our randomized design should have distributedthese potential biases equally across both study groups. Addition-ally, two brief screeners were used to assess FV intake as opposedto a more comprehensive food frequency questionnaire or 24-hrdietary recall. However, validity data on these two measuresindicate small to moderate correlations with 24-hr dietary recallsand serum total carotenoids (Resnicow et al., 2002).
Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that MI counsel-
ing and trying out recipes may be effective in helping a high-riskpopulation increase its FV intake. Results also suggest that inter-vening directly within the HD community reduces many of the keyobstacles of access and availability that often impede this under-served population’s participation in health promotion programs.
