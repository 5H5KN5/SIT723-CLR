Abstract
Background: This paper presents a case study that demonstrates the evolution of a project entitled "Enhancing QUality-
of-care In Psychosis" (EQUIP) that began approximately wh e n  t h e  U . S .  D e p a r t m e n t  o f  V e t e r a n s  A f f a i r s '  Q u a l i t y
Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), and implementati on science were emerging. EQUIP developed methods and
tools to implement chronic illness care principles in the treatment of schizophr enia, and evaluated this implementation
using a small-scale controlled trial. The next iteration of th e project, EQUIP-2, was furthe r informed by implementation
science and the use of QUERI tools.
Methods: This paper reports the background, development, resu lts and implications of EQUIP, and also describes
ongoing work in the second phase of th e project (EQUIP-2). The EQUIP interventi on uses implementation strategies and
tools to increase the adoption and implem entation of chronic illness care princi ples. In EQUIP-2, these strategies and
tools are conceptually grounded in a st ages-of-change model, and include clinical  and delivery system interventions and
adoption/implementation tools. Format ive evaluation occurs in conjunction  with the intervention, and includes
developmental, progress-focused, implementa tion-focused, and interpretive evaluation.
Results: Evaluation of EQUIP provided an  understanding of quality gaps and how to address related problems in
schizophrenia. EQUIP showed that soluti ons to quality problems in schizophreni a differ by treatment domain and are
exacerbated by a lack of awareness of evidence-based pr actices. EQUIP also showed that improving care requires
creating resources for physicians to help  them easily implement practice change s, plus intensive education as well as
product champions who help physicians us e these resources. Organizational chan ges, such as the addition of care
managers and informatics systems, were shown to help physicians with identifying problems, making referrals, and
monitoring follow-up. In EQUIP-2, which is currently in progress, these initial findings were used to develop a more
comprehensive approach to implementing and evaluating the chronic illness care model.
Discussion: In QUERI, small-scale projects co ntribute to the development and enhancement of hands-on, action-
oriented service-directed projects that  are grounded in current implementati on science. This project supports the
concept that QUERI tools can be useful in implementing  complex care mode ls oriented toward evidence-based
improvement of clinical care.Published: 15 February 2008

Shortly after the inauguration of the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) Quality Enhancement Research Ini-
tiative (QUERI) in 1998, a Request for Proposals (RFP)
was released for Investigator-Initiated Research (IIR)
projects that focused on implementing clinical guidelines
in VA healthcare facilities. Recognizing that implementa-
tion of guidelines was not a straightforward endeavor, the
RFP suggested particular attention be paid to barriers to
guideline implementation , such as "provider issues (knowl-
edge, attitudes, and behavior) and system issues (e.g.,
resources, culture, patient population, etc.)." At that time,
"implementation" was to be operationalized "in terms of
observed changes in practice and, when possible, changes
in patient and system outcomes (cost, quality of care,
average length of stay, policy or procedure changes, prac-
tice variations), i.e., not mere dissemination of, or pro-
nouncements about, guidelines." The science of
implementation was still in development; specific meth-
ods for engaging in implementation science had not yet
been spelled out, and instead, more traditional
approaches were being used to design and assess the proc-
ess of implementation.
In this paper, we present the evolution of a project that
began approximately when QUERI and implementation
science began, and that has been transformed, with con-
tinued funding, into a project that explicitly engages in
implementation science as it is currently defined and
operationalized within QUERI [1]. The initial project,
"Enhancing QUality-of-care In Psychosis," or EQUIP,
developed methods and tools to apply a chronic illness
care model in schizophrenia, and evaluated the imple-
mentation of this care model using a small-scale control-
led trial. The EQUIP intervention used strategic tools to
increase the adoption and improve the implementation ofthis care model. It included substantial qualitative meth-
ods, though its formative evaluation was modest by cur-
rent standards.
Evaluation of EQUIP led to a more recent project, EQUIP-
2, which is a larger-scale trial of the chronic illness care
model implementation currently in progress. Tools from
EQUIP have been refined, and improvements have been
made to the original implementation method. In addi-
tion, EQUIP-2 incorporates a more complete formative
evaluation to optimize future, broader implementation of
the EQUIP intervention. Our ability to design the project
in this way reflects recent advances that have been made
in the science of implementation, particularly with regard
to the various types of formative evaluation that can be
used over the stages of a project [2]. In describing the evo-
lution of the EQUIP project, we illustrate the value of the
QUERI expectation that study development and refine-
ment should occur in implementation research within
and across phased, improvement-focused projects. We
hope the paper will stimulate additional scientific discus-
sion about the challenges of implementation.
This article is one in a Series of articles documenting
implementation science frameworks and approaches
developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI).
QUERI is briefly outlined in Table 1 and described in
more detail in previous publications [3,4]. The Series'
introductory article [1] highlights aspects of QUERI that
are related specifically to implementation science, and
describes additional types of articles contained in the
QUERI Series .
Below we provide a brief overview of the Mental Health
QUERI Center which supports the current project. We
Table 1: The VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI)
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Quality En hancement Research Initiative (QUER I) was launched in 1998. QUERI was d esigned to 
harness VA's health services rese arch expertise and resources in an ongoing system-wide effort to  improve the performance of th e VA healthcare 
system and, thus, quality  of care for veterans.
QUERI researchers collaborate with VA po licy and practice leaders, clinicians, and oper ations staff to implement appropriate ev idence-based 
practices into routine clinical care. They work within distinct disease- or condit ion-specific QUERI Centers and utilize a stan dard six-step process:
1) Identify high-risk/high-volume diseases or problems.
2) Identify best practices.
3) Define existing practice patterns and outcomes across the VA and current variation from best practices.
4) Identify and implement interventions to promote best practices.
5) Document that best practices improve outcomes.
6) Document that outcomes are associated with  improved health-related quality of life.
Within Step 4, QUERI implementation effort s generally follow a sequence of four phases to enable the refinement and spread of e ffective and 
sustainable implementa tion programs across multiple VA medica l centers and clinics. The phases include:
1) Single site pilot,
2) Small scale, multi-site implementation trial,
3) Large scale, multi-region  implementation trial, and
4) System-wide rollout.
Researchers employ additional QUERI framew orks and tools, as highlighted in this Series , to enhance achievement of each project's quality 
improvement and implementation science goals.

methods used in the project, followed by a presentation of
the EQUIP findings. The second half of the paper concen-
trates on a description of EQUIP-2 methods, which was
funded through a different mechanism than EQUIP, and,
as noted above, is more clearly a project that engages in
implementation science. We conclude by reflecting on the
utility of the QUERI process and proposing directions for
future hands-on, action-oriented research [4].
The Mental Health QUERI (MHQ) focus on schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a chronic medical disorder that occurs in
about 1% of the population, and results in substantial
morbidity and mortality when poorly treated. Although
evidence-based practices (EBPs) improve outcomes in
schizophrenia, these treatments are not often used [5,6].
Some EBPs, such as 'Assertive Community Treatment' and
'Individualized Placement and Support,' have not been
widely implemented, thereby limiting patient access. For
other EBPs, such as clozapine (commonly used drug for
schizophrenia) and caregiver services, clinicians may lack
the competencies to deliver them, and typical clinic
organization is not consistent with their use. In addition,
evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI, [7]) has
been nearly impossible in treating schizophrenia because
existing medical records (including electronic medical
records) lack reliable information regarding patient symp-
toms, side-effects, and functioning [8]. Although national
organizations, including the VA, have made implementa-
tion of appropriate care for schizophrenia a high priority
[9,10], there has been only modest success in developing
interventions to overcome implementation barriers [11-
13]. Clearly, interventions that enhance the implementa-
tion of evidence-based treatments are needed in schizo-
phrenia. The interventions tested in EQUIP and EQUIP-2
involve tools for supporting the implementation of
chronic illness care principles in schizophrenia.
EQUIP Methods
This section describes the EQUIP project and implemen-
tation intervention methods in more detail, and the meth-
ods used in the formative evaluation component of
EQUIP.
EQUIP overview and specific aims
Funded in 2001, the goals of EQUIP were to develop,
implement and evaluate a strategy designed to apply the
chronic illness care model to the outpatient treatment of
schizophrenia in a Step 4, Phase 1 QUERI project (see
Table 1). As noted above, projects responding to the 1998
RFP were geared toward "guideline implementation." In
schizophrenia, application of a chronic illness care model
requires attention to several sets of pertinent guidelines,
including established principles of chronic illness man-
agement [14,15] and national treatment guidelines forschizophrenia. At the time of EQUIP, these guidelines
included the American Psychiatric Association guidelines
[16], the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) treatment rec-
ommendations [17], and a VA treatment algorithm (These
guidelines have subsequently been updated [18,19]).
Taken together, the EQUIP care model focused on
improving treatment in three domains: 1) treatment
assertiveness and care coordination, 2) guideline-con-
cordant medication management of symptoms and side-
effects, and 3) family services.
The specific aims of EQUIP were to: 1) Assess, in a rand-
omized, controlled trial, the effect of a chronic illness care
model for schizophrenia relative to usual care on: a) clini-
cian attitudes regarding controlling symptoms and side-
effects, and regarding family/caregiver involvement in
care; b) clinician practice patterns and adherence to guide-
line recommendations; c) patient compliance with treat-
ment recommendations; d) patient clinical outcomes
(e.g., symptoms, side-effects, quality of life, and satisfac-
tion); and e) patient utilization of treatment services; and
2) Assess, using mixed qualitative and quantitative meth-
ods, the success of the implementation strategy's impact
on uptake of the model.
EQUIP research design and methods
The chronic illness care principles were evaluated at two
outpatient mental health clinics within two large, urban
VA medical centers in Southern California. At these two
clinics, psychiatrists were randomized to the best practice
intervention (care model) or control (treatment as usual).
Case managers and patients were assigned to the same
study arm as the psychiatrists with whom they were asso-
ciated. At the third clinic, within one of the medical cent-
ers, all the clinicians and patients were assigned to the
control group. The chronic illness care model intervention
was developed, implemented and fully operational in Jan-
uary 2003 and was sustained for more than 15 months.
The relevant institutional review boards approved all trial
procedures.
Clinicians were eligible for the study if they practiced at
one of the clinics. Eligible clinicians were given informa-
tion about the study and the opportunity to enroll.
Patients were eligible if they were at least 18 years old, had
a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
had at least one visit with an enrolled psychiatrist during
a four-month sampling period immediately before the
enrollment period (i.e., "visit-based sampling" [6]), and
had at least one clinic visit during a five-month enroll-
ment period. When an eligible patient came into the clinic
during the enrollment period, he or she was provided
with information about the study and was given the
opportunity to enroll. The intervention included 32 psy-

(page number not for citation purposes)chiatrists, 1 nurse practitioner, 3 nurse case managers, and
173 patients. The control group included 43 psychiatrists,
1 psychiatric pharmacist, 3 nurse case managers, and 225
patients. Informed consent was obtained from all
patients, or their legal conservators, and all clinicians.
The study included clinical interventions, delivery system
interventions, and adoption/implementation tools. These
interventions and tools are presented in Table 2. One of
the innovations of EQUIP was the use of the Medical
Informatics Network Tool (MINT) to provide instant,
summarized clinical information (via a "PopUp" win-
dow, see Table 2) to clinicians as they accessed the
patient's medical record. As noted in the table, adoption
and implementation tools also were utilized to enhance
the utility and effectiveness of the intervention.
EQUIP formative evaluation methods
In addition to the implementation strategy described
above, EQUIP involved formative evaluation. Table 3
depicts the methods that were utilized in the evaluation.
Pre- and post-implementation semi-structured interviews
and surveys were conducted to assess experience with
research, clinical practice and competencies, plus expecta-
tions and observations of the implementation. At the time
of the post-implementation survey, the research team was
already planning EQUIP-2 (described below) and, there-
fore, specific feedback was desired for the next phase of
implementation. These pre- and post-implementation
interviews and surveys were conducted by research staff.
There was an attempt to interview and survey as many psy-
chiatrists as possible from both the intervention and con-
trol arms of the study.Mid-implementation interviews and surveys were con-
ducted to assess the process of intervention implementa-
tion. These mid-intervention interviews were conducted
by an independent contractor (A. Brown). Via surveys, cli-
nicians were asked specifically how the informatics system
was working for them, as well as about the effect of the
Quality Report. Both the mid-implementation interview
and survey were conducted with a sub-sample of psychia-
trists- those who were most involved with the implemen-
tation due to higher caseloads of patients in the sample.
As a result of the timing of this mid-implementation feed-
back, changes were made midway through, to make rele-
vant interventions more effective and appealing.
EQUIP results
Main evaluation findings
The evaluation of EQUIP provided an understanding of
quality gaps and how to address related problems in schiz-
ophrenia. Our findings are summarized in the left column
of Table 4.
EQUIP revealed that solutions to quality problems in
schizophrenia differ by treatment domain. For example,
challenges to implementing family services proved to be
very different from challenges to implementing weight
management using wellness groups. Improving family
services required assessment of each patient-caregiver rela-
tionship, intensive negotiation with patients and caregiv-
ers, major care reorganization to accommodate family
involvement, and attention to clinician competencies
(e.g., knowledge, attitude, and skills). Improving weight
and wellness required assessment of the problem in each
patient, the establishment of therapeutic groups, involve-
ment of nutrition and recreational services, and help with
referrals and follow-ups.
Table 2: EQUIP inte rvention components
Clinical intervention
• Chronic illness care model aimed at lesse ning psychotic symptoms and medication side effects an d increasing family/caregiver involvement in 
care
Delivery system interventions
• Research nurse (RN) stationed at  each of the clinics assessed every intervention patient at each visit.
• Protocols for assertive, coordinated care.
• Resources supporting eviden ce-based medication manageme nt and family services [37].
• "Medical Informatics Network Tool" (MINT, [2 1]), an informatics system that collected and managed outcomes data in real time and worked in 
conjunction with the VA's fu lly electronic medical record.
• MINT generated a window ("PopUp") each ti me an enrolled provider opened the electron ic medical record of an intervention pati ent.
• The PopUp window contained the RN's clinica l assessment, with urgent i ssues highlighted. The PopUp provided links to treatmen t guidelines, 
and allowed for secure messaging  among the clinical team members.
• MINT produced Quality Reports to track data regarding the clinical stat us of the psychiatrist's pati ents in three domains: co mpliance and 
caregiver problems, symptoms, and medication side-effects.
• Quality Reports were distribute d quarterly by the research nu rse to enrolled psychiatrists.
Adoption/implementation tools
• Marketing of the care model via ed ucational activities and trainings.
• Partnerships with clinic personnel.
• Product champions were nominated by the site PI mid-interventio n. They were asked to promote the goals of the project during regular staff 
meetings.

(page number not for citation purposes)EQUIP also revealed that quality problems can arise from
poor clinician competencies [20]. For example, we found
clinician competency problems in the use of clozapine.
This clozapine competency problem is well established
anecdotally, although there is little empirical evidence of
it. The main competency problems that we encountered,
in at least a subset of clinicians, were: 1) clinicians werenot trained in the use of clozapine, or had not used it
despite training; 2) clinicians were not credentialed to use
clozapine in their settings; 3) clinicians were discouraged
by the possibility that having patients on clozapine would
necessitate longer clinical visits with more clinical effort;
and/or 4) clinicians did not believe clozapine would be
helpful. Quality problems can also arise due to difficultyTable 3: EQUIP formative evaluation methods
Pre-implementation
• Semi-structured interviews  conducted by research personnel with intervention and control psychiatrist pa rticipants (n = 35): gathered data on 
psychiatrists' previous ex perience with research, their clinical practices,  and expected barriers an d facilitators of intervent ion components.
• Self-report questionnaire  completed by intervention and contro l psychiatrist participants (n = 44): gathe red data on psychiatrists' training, 
attitudes, knowledge and skills related to schizophrenia and guidelines, and on workload.
Mid-implementation
• Semi-structured qualitative interviews  conducted by an independent contractor with a sub- sample of the intervention  clinical and research staff 
(n = 18): gathered data on usefulness of the PopUps, in order to  make any necessary changes that would enhance the remainder of  the EQUIP 
intervention.
• Computer System Us ability Questionnaire  [38] completed by sub-sample  of intervention psychiatrist par ticipants (n = 16): gathered 
quantitative data on experiences with the PopUps.
• Quality Report survey  completed by sub-sample of intervention psychiatrist participan ts (n = 8): provided data on  uptake of the Quality Report 
they received quarterly.
Post-implementation
• Semi-structured qualitative interviews  conducted by research personnel with intervention and co ntrol clinical and research staff (n = 11): 
gathered data on psychiatrists' current c linical practices, barriers and facilitator s of intervention c omponents, especially th e unsuccessful family 
component, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the implemen tation program, and recommendations for future programs.
• Self-report questionnaire  completed by intervention and contro l psychiatrist participants (n = 14): gathe red data on psychia trists' attitudes, 
knowledge and skills related to schizophrenia and guidelines, their attitudes ab out recovery and family services, and on worklo ad.
Table 4: Findings in EQ UIP and resulting adjust ments made in EQUIP-2
EQUIP Finding EQUIP-2 Adjustment: Intervention
Clinical interventions
Care targets were equa lly applied at all sites. Sites choose their pref erred care targets base d on local needs and 
resources.
Delivery system interventions
Providers made limited use of symptom assessments performed by 
highly trained nurse assessors, and questioned the accuracy of the 
assessments.Patients complete self-assessments, which are given to relevant 
providers.
Providers at the clinics had high levels of depersonalization, high levels of 
exhaustion, and a low sense of personal accomplishment (burn-out).One clinic staff member included in project calls and meetings in order 
to modify the care model to local n eeds and organization. Staff provided 
with more feedback throughout implementation, including material and 
other reinforcements for high achievers.
The Quality Report was distributed quarterly by the nurse to each 
individual psychiatrist, with only modest discussion.The Quality Report is distributed at monthly staff meetings by the 
product champion. Quality of care outliers (good and bad) and clinic-
wide problems are discussed among the team.
The PopUp included links to summaries of treatment guidelines, but 
psychiatrists did not use these links.Treatment recommendation s will be "pushed" to psychiatrists in the 
context of specific patients, and c omputers will provide patients with 
education about guideline- concordant treatments.
Adoption/implementation tools
A non-systematic approach to site in ception may have affected buy-in 
and enthusiasm.A project "kick-off" is highlighted  with participation of all sites.
Engagement was primarily with clinic-leve l personnel. Engagement occurs with  clinic-level personnel, medical center 
personnel, and regional policy-makers.
Case managers were important, but were available only at one site and 
entered the project late.Case managers are involved from the beginning.
Product champions were appointed by medical center administration 
late, and were less intens ively involved than desired.Product champions self-identify prio r to implementation and are more 
fully utilized.

(page number not for citation purposes)in changing psychiatric treatments. In EQUIP, we noted
that psychiatrists made minimal use of data showing that
their patients had high levels of symptoms and side-
effects (Quality Reports), and they also made minimal use
of the guidelines that were easily accessible via the MINT
"PopUp" (see Table 2) that was available on their compu-
ter at every clinical encounter [21].
Quality problems such as these can be exacerbated by a
general lack of awareness of evidence-based practices,
such as approaches to managing increased weight or treat-
ment-refractory psychosis. During the course of imple-
mentation, it became apparent to the research team that
increasing the intensity of follow-up (e.g., adding clinic
visits) for severely ill patients was of limited use. Clini-
cians typically did not change treatments in response to
clinical data. Therefore, additional treatment visits were of
limited value because they were not likely to lead to
appropriate changes in treatment in response to psychosis
or medication side-effects.
Based on what we were seeing in terms of these persistent
quality problems, we began to conclude that improving
care required creating resources to support clinicians and
reorganizing care to help them easily implement changes
in their clinical practices. Also, there was a need for inten-
sive education and product champions who would work
with clinicians to encourage awareness and use of these
resources. Care managers and the informatics system did
help physicians identify clinical problems in their
patients, but these interventions and tools needed reas-
sessment and possibly redesign. For example, we learned,
through the involvement of the case managers, that tools
designed for clinicians may not have the same appeal
across types of clinicians. We found that psychiatrists and
case managers (though the sample was small) had differ-
ing perspectives on the value of being provided with clin-
ical data by their computer (e.g., PopUps) during the
encounter. This supported the assertion that formative
evaluation data must be gathered from multiple perspec-
tives. As Lyons et al. point out, it is essential to examine
the perspectives of multiple individuals: the "single-pro-
vider focus does not well represent clinical reality as expe-
rienced by interdisciplinary teams [22]."
Finally, we learned that improving care within the VA
healthcare system (and perhaps other large healthcare
organizations) can require high-level organizational
involvement. For example, implementing wellness groups
or clozapine clinics required active involvement from
nutrition and pharmacy, respectively, which were medical
center-wide services. Indeed, sometimes management of
these services resided at the level of the Veterans Inte-
grated Service Network (VISN; the 21 VA regions of the
United States). Nutrition and pharmacy services did notrespond to requests from staff at the level of mental health
clinics, and this lack of responsiveness impeded our abil-
ity to implement a clozapine clinic or to involve the nutri-
tion department in the wellness programs.
EQUIP-2 Methods
This section describes: 1) the EQUIP-2 project and con-
ceptual framework, 2) the evolution of the EQUIP-2
implementation strategy (i.e., interventions and tools),
and 3) the formative evaluation component of EQUIP-2.
EQUIP-2 overview
As noted above, the next phase of work building toward
national roll-out of the EQUIP intervention is EQUIP-2 –
a Step 4, Phase 2 multi-site evaluation (See Table 1). As
the Overview to the Series notes [1], projects within this
phase are considered "clinical trials to further refine and
evaluate an improvement/implementation program."
These trials involve a small sample of facilities conducting
the implementation program under somewhat idealized
conditions. Moreover, it is noted [4] that these projects
require active research team support and involvement,
plus modest real-time refinements to maximize the likeli-
hood of success and to study the process for replication
requirements. They employ formative evaluation (to
monitor and feed back information regarding implemen-
tation and acceptance and impacts), as well as develop-
ment and use of formal measurement tools and
evaluation methods.
EQUIP-2 is a three-year project that was funded in January
2006, and aimed at our implementation strategy refine-
ment and broad formative evaluation in eight sites across
four VISNs that used the implementation approaches
adopted by QUERI. As noted above, EQUIP-2 was funded
as an SDP [4], which involves a unique set of expectations
in terms of addressing what are called "quality gaps" (i.e.,
the current lack of evidence-based care for schizophrenia,
described above).
The project reflects the growth in knowledge, both at the
researcher and study reviewer levels, regarding implemen-
tation science. More specifically, unlike EQUIP, this study
includes a conceptually-driven study of the process of
implementation that includes the effect of various inter-
ventions on patients, clinicians, and organizations, and a
more conceptually-based implementation strategy. The
early implementation efforts described above also
prompted the EQUIP-2 investigators to incorporate and/
or strengthen several components of the multi-phasic
evaluation as described by Stetler and colleagues [2].
These authors recommend: diagnostic analysis of organi-
zational readiness (e.g., using relevant surveys) and inter-
views regarding attitudes and beliefs; implementation-
focused evaluation examining the context where change is

(page number not for citation purposes)taking place; maintenance and optimization of research
implementation interventions; and provision of feedback,
e.g., regarding progress on targeted goals. They also rec-
ommend collecting data from experts, representative cli-
nicians/administrators, and other key informants
regarding both pre-implementation barriers and facilita-
tors and post-implementation perceptions of the evi-
dence-based practice and implementation strategy. All of
these elements are being utilized in EQUIP-2 and are
described further below with regard to the formative eval-
uation.
Conceptual framework: Simpson Transfer Model & 
PRECEDE
Though informed by more than one conceptual frame-
work, EQUIP-2 is organized around the Simpson Transfer
Model (STM). This model guides the development and
refinement of a diversified, flexible menu of tools and
interventions to improve schizophrenia care. Incorporat-
ing the notion of readiness to change [23] at both the
individual and organizational levels, Simpson developed
a program change model for transferring research into
practice [24]. The STM has provided important conceptual
input to many studies in technology transfer [25-27]. This
model involves four action stages: exposure, adoption,
implementation, and practice. Exposure is dedicated to
introducing and training in the new technology; adoption
refers to an intention to try a new technology/innovation
through a program leadership decision and subsequent
support; implementation refers to exploratory use of the
technology/innovation; and practice refers to routine use
of the technology/innovation, likely with the help of cus-
tomization of the technology/innovation at the local
level. Crucial to moving from exposure to implementa-
tion are personal motivations of staff and resources pro-
vided by the institution (e.g., training, leadership),
organizational characteristics such as "climate for change"
(e.g., staff cohesion, presence of product champions,
openness to change), staff attributes (e.g., adaptability,
self-efficacy), and characteristics of the innovations them-
selves (e.g., complexity, benefit, observability).
EQUIP-2 also draws upon the PRECEDE planning model
for designing behavior change initiatives [28]. Because the
STM model does not recommend specific behavior change
tools to be used in a knowledge transfer intervention,
additional guidance is necessary regarding development
of the implementation framework. The PRECEDE acro-
nym stands for "predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling
factors in diagnosis and evaluation." PRECEDE stresses
the importance of applying multiple interventions to
influence the adoption of targeted clinician behaviors.
These include: 1) academic detailing and consultation
with an opinion leader or clinical expert, which can help
predispose clinicians to be willing and able to make thedesired changes; 2) patient screening technologies, clini-
cal reminders, and/or other clinical support tools that can
enable clinicians to change; and 3) social or economic
incentives that can reinforce clinicians' implementation of
targeted behaviors.
A key part of the PRECEDE model is the active participation
of the target audience in defining the issues and factors
that influence targeted behaviors, and in developing and
implementing solutions [28]. This participation principle
is consistent with the social marketing framework, which
emphasizes the importance of understanding a target
audience's initial and ongoing perceptions of the innova-
tion, in order to facilitate behavior change [29,30]. Both
PRECEDE and social marketing theory state that messages
and interventions should be tailored to perceptions in
order to influence the desired behavior change.
Taken together, the models and frameworks discussed
above suggest that the impact of implementation efforts
will be maximized when they: 1) are based on assess-
ments of the needs, barriers, and incentives of targeted
end users; 2) are based on an understanding of the local
context; 3) involve representatives of diverse stake-holder
groups in the planning process; 4) use expert involvement
in planning, especially when behaviors to be adopted
and/or changed are complex; 5) draw on marketing prin-
ciples for developing and disseminating intervention
tools; and 6) secure support and involvement from top
level management and product champions [31-33]. Each
of these factors is integrated into the STM, which guides
the EQUIP-2 strategy and formative evaluation. Table 5
provides an overview of how we will engage in each phase
of the STM.
Evolution of the schizophrenia implementation strategy
Several modifications were made in EQUIP-2 as a result of
the findings and observations in EQUIP. An overview of
each type of strategy is provided below; Table 4 (right col-
umn) notes the specific changes made in EQUIP-2 based
on findings from EQUIP.
Evidence-based clinical/therapeutic practices
EQUIP-2 is more targeted than EQUIP in its approach to
strengthening specific evidence-based practices within the
care model. EQUIP-2 focuses on quality improvement by
assisting staff to implement specific evidence-based prac-
tices that have shown strong impacts on outcomes [7]. In
addition, since EQUIP's onset, the VA has made a national
commitment to implementing "recovery-oriented" prac-
tices in schizophrenia, which is embodied in the Presi-
dent's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health that
was established in 2002 [34], and the VA's Mental Health
Strategic Plan [10]. Thus, EQUIP-2 provides implementa-
tion support on evidence-based practices that support

evidence-based practices from a list of four practices that
EQUIP-2 was prepared to support (Table 6). All four
VISNs chose the same two targets – wellness and sup-
ported employment.
Delivery system interventions
During the intervention period, there is a monthly quality
meeting at each intervention clinic. This quality meeting
is "local" and the site PI (principal investigator), quality
coordinator, product champion, and clinicians attend this
meeting. During the meeting, each clinician is given his/
her personal "Quality Report." Quality meetings: 1) allow
pervasive quality problems to be identified, 2) optimize
teamwork by encouraging group problem-solving on
patient management problems, and 3) identify resources
needed to address care problems. Lastly, high-achieving
clinicians are discussed (i.e., those who are accomplishing
the specific goals of each care target) and incentives are
distributed.
Adoption/implementation tools
In terms of marketing, all of the sites had an explicit
project "kick-off" that signalled the start of the project and
promoted a sense of excitement. Educational activities
and trainings commenced both at the coordinating center
and at the individual clinics.
In order to promote further engagement and collabora-
tion, additional levels of personnel are involved in the
project from its inception. Prior to enrolment, we have
had monthly planning calls involving clinic staff, regional
managers, and medical center leadership. These calls
address practical issues regarding study set-up, as well as
plans for marketing. Once enrollment begins, we will
have monthly Implementation Team calls involving site
PIs, site project directors, product champions, VISN-level
staff, and the research team. These calls will examine and
address all implementation issues as they arise and will
work toward sustainability of the model. During the
course of implementation, we maintain the research nurse
position from EQUIP in the form of "Quality Coordina-
tors." These individuals were reported to make a differ-
ence in EQUIP, not only to clinicians, in that they
provided additional clinical information about patients,
but also to patients, in that they provided an additional
source of support. Further, we engage case managers from
the beginning of the project.
We encourage staff to identify who they go to for expertise
in the chosen care targets, and ask that individual to vol-
unteer as product champions for the project. We identify
product champions based on this information and ask
them to participate in monthly Implementation Team
calls, as well as other mechanisms of involvement.Formative evaluation
As noted above, this Phase 2 implementation project
involves a more formal evaluation component, due to the
importance at this stage of program refinement. Below we
describe each component of the formative evaluation.
Developmental evaluation
In EQUIP, we observed that organizational climate and
staff engagement and structure significantly affected the
degree to which the tools presented in the project were
effective. This observation is consistent with emerging
implementation science, which itself is increasingly recog-
nizing the importance of context. In order to better under-
stand and "diagnose" [2] the organizational climate of the
sites, the Simpson Transfer Model organizational readi-
ness measures will be used in EQUIP-2. We also conduct
key informant interviews in order to better understand the
clinics' preparedness for the intervention.
Implementation-focused evaluation
Each month during implementation, there are Implemen-
tation Team meetings, which serve to link intervention
sites and the research team from the coordinating center.
Here, barriers and facilitators to implementation are iden-
tified and discussed, and group problem-solving and any
needed reorganization of care is planned and docu-
mented. Product champions and other site personnel also
report on any informal feedback they have received about
problems with the implementation. As implementation
continues, this team works toward sustainability of the
model. Minutes from these meetings, project managers'
field notes, and quality coordinators' logs are analyzed to
evaluate implementation throughout the intervention
period. In addition, midway through the intervention, the
research team conducts semi-structured interviews with
clinicians and clinic managers to evaluate the operation-
alization of the intervention, necessary refinements to the
intervention, and areas of desired guidance. In order to
reduce burn-out, promote and maintain enthusiasm for
the project, and to optimize successful implementation
overall, various interventions are modified if feedback
and other formative data indicate that change is necessary.
Progress-focused evaluation
During the course of the project, in order to monitor
progress toward the project's goals, we evaluate the degree
to which physicians respond to the patient self-assess-
ments. For example, do they provide the necessary and/or
requested referrals to supported employment, and do they
refer patients to wellness groups for weight management.
We also assess the Quality Reports for other outcome
progress. When we find that progress is not being made
toward the goals, we work in coordination with the clinics
to identify barriers to achieving the goals and strategies for
addressing and mitigating the barriers.

(page number not for citation purposes)Interpretive evaluation
At the conclusion of the project, we will conduct semi-
structured interviews with the clinicians and clinic manag-
ers regarding the usefulness of the EQUIP-2 strategy, their
satisfaction with the implementation process, barriers to
and facilitators of implementation, and recommenda-
tions for future refinements [2]. In order to re-evaluate the
delivery system interventions, we will collect quantitative
data about the usability of the informatics system. Meas-
ures of organizational readiness will be repeated, in order
to describe changes in organizational climate during the
course of the project, as another potential influence on
successful implementation. And the extent to which the
care model has become "institutionalized," (i.e., degree to
which the care model has become part of routine clinical
practice) will be examined.
For the final interpretive evaluation, we will explore all
formative evaluation data in light of our outcome data in
order to provide: alternative explanations of results; clari-
fication of our implementation effort success (or failure);
and assessment of the potential for reproducibility of our
implementation strategy in a broader segment of the VA
[4].
Discussion
The evolution of the EQUIP implementation program
took shape during the development of the field of imple-
mentation science. The experience in EQUIP, combined
with the guidance received from the subsequent EQUIP-2
protocol, led to a Step 4, Phase 2 activity that more explic-
itly engages in evidence-based quality improvement and
in formal evaluation. Although the formative evaluation
in EQUIP was more limited compared to recently devel-
oped formative evaluations, it produced important new
information regarding quality improvement in schizo-
phrenia. It has been widely acknowledged that there are
major problems with the quality of routine care for schiz-
ophrenia, but there has been limited research on how to
improve this care and on the challenges to improving
care. EQUIP identified effective and ineffective methods
and strategies for improving care, and provided results
that can be of substantial use to people working to
improve treatment and outcomes in this disorder.
We agree with Kitson, Harvey, & McCormack [35] that the
level and nature of evidence, the environment in which
research is placed, and the method in which the process of
implementation is undertaken can be equally important
in successful implementation: "Implementation may not
be successful within a context that is receptive to change,
because there is non-existent or ineffective facilitation ...
For implementation to be successful, there needs to be a
clear understanding of the nature of evidence being used,
the quality of context in terms of its ability to cope withchange and type of facilitation needed to ensure a success-
ful change process" (p. 152). Accordingly, our approach
in EQUIP-2 addresses the interventions, environment,
and process equally, and involves thorough assessment of
each component.
Clearly a multi-faceted evaluation is needed to develop a
comprehensive understanding of barriers to and facilita-
tors of implementation of the chronic illness care model
in schizophrenia. In this disorder, barriers to improving
care in EQUIP varied by evidence-based practice, and
included under-developed clinician competencies, burn-
out among clinicians, limited availability of psychosocial
treatments, inadequate attention to medication side-
effects, and organization of care that was not consistent
with high quality practice. Facilitators to improving care
included interest among clinicians and policymakers in
improving care, and robust specialty mental health serv-
ices. Summative evaluation is not sufficient to understand
these components. Instead, as begun in EQUIP and more
fully developed in EQUIP-2, we believe that a conceptu-
ally-driven formative evaluation can provide more detail
as to the interactions between interventions, process, and
context. Research such as EQUIP-2 should help to deter-
mine the relative importance of each component, provid-
ing direction as to when one component needs more
attention than another during the course of a quality
improvement implementation project [36]. Scientifically-
based qualitative evaluations of quality improvement in
schizophrenia may guide project development,
strengthen future stages of intervention development (as
illustrated in the development of EQUIP-2), and inform
future mixed methods evaluation within the field of
implementation science.
