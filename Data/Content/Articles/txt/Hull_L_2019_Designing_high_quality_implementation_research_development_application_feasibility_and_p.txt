Abstract
Background: Designing implementation research can be a complex and daunting task, especially for applied
health researchers who have not received specialist training in implementation science. We developed the
Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) tool and supplementary guide to address this challenge
and provide researchers with a systematic approach to designing implementation research.
Methods: A multi-method and multi-stage approach was employed. An international, multidisciplinary expert panel
engaged in an iterative brainstorming and consensus-building process to generate core domains of the ImpRes tool,
representing core implementation scie nce principles and concepts that researchers should consider when designing
implementation research. Simultaneously, an iterative process of reviewing the literature and expert input informed the
development and content of the tool. Once consensus ha d been reached, specialist expert input was sought on
involving and engaging patients/servi ce users; and economic evaluation. ImpR es was then applied to 15 implementation
and improvement science projects across the National Institu te of Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in

Results: Consensus was reached on ten implementation science domains to be considered when designing implementation
research. These include implementation t heories, frameworks and models, determin ants of implementation, implementation
strategies, implementation outcomes and unintended consequences. Researchers who used the ImpRes tool found it useful
for identifying project areas where impleme ntation science is lacking (median 5/5, IQR 4 –5 )a n df o ri m p r o v i n gt h eq u a l i t yo f
implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4 –5) and agreed that it contained the key components that should be considered
when designing implementation research (median 4/5, IQR 4 –4). Qualitative feedback from researchers who applied the
ImpRes tool indicated that a supplementary guide was needed to facilitate use of the tool.
Conclusions: We have developed a feasible and acceptable tool, and supplementary guide, to fa cilitate consideration and
incorporation of core principles and concepts of implementati on science in applied health imp lementation research. Future
research is needed to establish whether application of the tool and guide has an e ffect on the quality of implementation
research.

Background
Evidence-based and cost-effective interventions consist-
ently fail to be implemented into routine practice and
policy [ 1], and even when such interventions are imple-
mented, this is an effortful, unpredictable and typically
slow process [ 2]. As a result, despite increasing pressure
to improve the safety and quality of financially over-
stretched healthcare services, patients fail to receive op-
timal care and healthcare organizations fail to benefit
from cost saving opportunities [ 1]. Over the past few
years, increased and focused efforts to close the eviden-
ce-to-practice gap have resulted in further recognition of
the importance of implementation science as a concep-
tual and methodological approach to translate evidence
into routine practice [ 1,3,4].
However, despite the rapid growth of implementation
science, designing implementation research remains a
complex and daunting task for health researchers who
have not completed specialist training in implementation
science. Crable et al. [ 5] operationalized Proctor et al. ’s
recommended ten key ingredients for writing implementa-
tion research grant proposals [ 6] to quantitatively evaluate
the quality of proposals on ten criteria. Thirty pilot grant
applications submitted to a call for implementation and im-
provement science projects at an academic medical center
were assessed. Crable et al. re ported that most proposals
assessed performed poorly on most of the ten criteria [ 5].
For example, 67% of proposals failed to identify and de-
scribe the implementation str ategies to be used and/or in-
correctly described the intervention as an implementation
strategy. Furthermore, 70% of proposals failed to describe
implementation or improvement science related outcomes
and/or failed to link outcome s to the proposed study aims
and/or the unit of analysis was inappropriate for the pro-
posed study.
The challenge of designing implementation research is
exacerbated by the fact that implementation research
cuts across diverse scientific fields, resulting in the inev-
itable difficulty of identifying, appraising and synthesis-
ing relevant literature to inform design decisions. A
recently published editorial in Implementation Science
highlighted the need for capacity building initiatives in
the research and practice of implementation to fulfil the
demand for expertise in implementation science [ 7].
Concerns regarding the lack of guidance for designing
implementation research have been raised and, to a cer-
tain extent, are being addressed. For example, Waltz et al.
highlighted that guidance regarding how best to select
implementation strategies is lacking [ 8]. Similarly, lack of
guidance on how to select appropriate implementation
theories and frameworks has been highlighted and efforts
to develop such guidance is currently underway [ 9].
Whilst these efforts are worthwhile and necessary to ad-
vance the science of implementation, a tool consolidatingdesign guidance, to the best of our knowledge, does not
currently exist. As a result, healthcare researchers without
access to specialist implementation science expertise are
tasked with identifying and assimilating design guidance
and recommendations reported across a wide range of
journals when designing implementation research, or re-
search with substantial implementation components. This
is a challenging task, not always successfully accom-
plished —as evidenced by the aforementioned literature.
To address this challenge, we report the development,
application, feasibility and preliminary evaluation of the Im-
plementation Science Researc h Development (ImpRes) tool
and supplementary guide to pro vide health researchers with
a step-by-step approach to designing high-quality imple-
mentation research. Specifically, we aimed to (1) identify
the core principles and concep ts that research teams should
consider when designing high- quality implementation re-
search and (2) identify and syn thesize key methodological/
conceptual literature conta ining guidance and recommen-
dations for designing and evaluating implementation re-
search. Based on the above aims, we aimed to develop,
apply and evaluate a tool that guides researchers through
the key principles and researc hd e s i g nc o n s i d e r a t i o n so fi m -
plementation science when designing studies. The ImpRes
tool and guide aim to enable research teams to design
high-quality implementation research and as a result more
effectively implement evidence-based interventions into
routine practice, thereby reducing research waste, and im-
proving health outcomes.
Methods
A multi-stage, multi-method approach was used to de-
velop and evaluate the ImpRes tool and the subsequent
development of its supplementary guide (see Fig. 1).
Stage 1: development of the ImpRes tool (July 2015 –May
2016)
Development of the ImpRes tool began in July 2015.
The starting point and primary factor motivating the
development of the tool was firstly to evaluate the de-
gree to which the core principles and concepts of imple-
mentation science were embedded into research projects
conducted within a research organisation —the National
Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for
Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care
(CLAHRC) South London; and secondly to provide imple-
mentation research support to research teams as required.
After an initial review of the literature and consultation
with experts in the field, it was evident that a tool (or
framework) did not exist to allow for this form of evalu-
ation. The NIHR CLAHRC South London is a collabora-
tive partnership between two universities (King ’s College
London and St George ’s, University of London), four
geographically surrounding health service organisationsHull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 2 of 20
(Guy ’s and St Thomas ’NHS Foundation Trust, King ’s
College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St George ’s
University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and South
London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust) and two
other collaborating organisations (NHS England-funded
Health Innovation Network (HIN), south London ’s
academic health science network; and King ’sH e a l t hP a r t -
ners, the academic health sciences centre in south-east
London). NIHR CLAHRC South London was established
in 2014 as one of 13 such research organisations support-
ing the conduct and application of applied health research
across England; it has a catchment area of approximately
3.5 million people living and/or using the health services
within south London, England. NIHR CLAHRC South
London conducts research spanning a diversity ofhealthcare areas including clinical (e.g. maternity and
women ’s health and psychosis) and public health. In
addition to our collaborators within the London geog-
raphy, a significant body of the research conducted by
NIHR CLAHRC South London researchers is conducted
with national and international collaborators. For ex-
ample, researchers in our ‘diabetes theme ’are leading a
hybrid effectiveness-implementation study runs across the
UK and US treatment sites [ 10]. Similarly, a wide-ranging
portfolio of hybrid effectiveness-implementation and im-
plementation research is being conducted across the re-
search infrastructure, in many cases with international
collaborators [ 11], as well as methodological implementa-
tion science research [ 12]. The NIHR CLAHRC South
London includes the Centre for Implementation ScienceFig. 1 Development of the ImpRes tool and supplementary guideHull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 3 of 20
(CIS), which consists of a multidisciplinary group of im-
plementation and improvement scientists, statisticians,
health economists and behavioural and social science ex-
perts [ 13].
Development of the ImpRes tool involved an iterative
process of:
1a. Expert brainstorming and consensus-building sessions
(July 2015 –December 2015)
The CIS research team as well as international experts
in the fields of implementation science and other health-
care disciplines, who were members of the CIS Scientific
Advisory Panel (SAP), participated in three brainstorm-
ing sessions which informed the initial development and
content of the ImpRes tool. Brainstorming sessions took
place, and were the focus of, the CIS SAP face-to-face
meetings over a 6-month period (July 2015 –December
2015); additional input and feedback was sought from
the CIS SAP virtually (via email). Content suggestions
were collated by LH. Subsequently, the CIS research
team participated in a consensus-building session which
involved reviewing and considering the content sugges-
tions for inclusion in the ImpRes tool.
The CIS SAP is an international multidisciplinary
panel including clinicians and academics with expertise
in implementation science, improvement science, social
science, health policy, biostatistics, health economics,
health service research and patient and public involve-
ment. A full list of members of the CIS SAP is available
in the ImpRes guide [ 14]. The CIS SAP convenes on a
quarterly basis and offers critical appraisal and advice to
the CIS research and strategy.
1b. Identification of key methodological/conceptual
literature containing guidance and recommendations for
designing and evaluating implementation research (July
2015 –March 2018)
Concurrently with the consensus-building brainstorming
sessions, and informed by emerging ImpRes domains, a
review of the literature was undertaken to identify key
methodological/conceptual articles and reports contain-
ing guidance and recommendations relating to the
design and evaluation of implementation research.
Searching via PubMed and Google, articles and reports
containing design guidance relating to the domains of
ImpRes were identified and screened for relevance. Google
was searched to identify gray literature and relevant content
that would not have otherwise been identified through
PubMed. For example, in addition to peer-reviewed publi-
cations, searching via Google allowed for the identification
of websites, reports, webinars and blogs providing imple-
mentation research design gu idance. The search was con-
ducted between July 2015 and March 2018, with no date
restrictions. Basic search terms reflected the emerging coreImpRes domains (e.g. ‘implementation outcomes ’and
‘implementation strategies ’) and were used to identify
relevant papers in PubMed and Google. Further, key
articles by prominent authors/research groups leading
work on specific domains of implementation science
were also searched, including guidelines and recommenda-
tions relating to implementation outcomes (Enola Proctor)
and implementation s trategies (Byron Powell). Further-
more, identification of key literature was informed by the
CIS SAP and the CIS implementation research teams ’ex-
pert knowledge. In this way, the ImpRes tool represents a
consolidation and unification of key implementation sci-
ence constructs informed by experts and key implementa-
tion science literature.
1c. Additional specialist input into specific ImpRes domains
(January 2016 –March 2016)
Once the core domains of the ImpRes tool were estab-
lished (i.e. through consensus amongst the CIS research
team and SAP), additional specialist expert input into
the content of specific domains of the ImpRes tool was
sought. Specifically, the lead researcher (LH) met with
NIHR CLAHRC South London specialists in patient and
public involvement, and specialists in health economics
(AH, a member of the research team), to review and co--
design the content of the ‘patient and public involvement
and engagement ’and ‘economic evaluation ’ImpRes do-
mains, respectively. Specialist input was sought as PPI and
economic evaluation are specialist fields, both of which
are considered important facets of implementation re-
search [ 15,16].
1d. Pilot testing and refinement (December 2015 –May 2016)
The ImpRes tool was piloted by an experienced health
services researcher without implementation science
expertise (i.e. the intended target audience of the ImpRes
tool). The ImpRes tool was completed independently by
the researcher, using a research project that the re-
searcher was leading on. Following completion, the lead
researcher (LH) sought feedback on the ImpRes tool.
Stage 2: application of the ImpRes tool (June 2016 –
August 2018)
The ImpRes tool was applied to 15 implementation and
improvement science research projects prospectively (i.e.
at project design stage) or retrospectively (i.e. after all pro-
ject design decisions had been made and/or the project
had been completed), across the NIHR CLAHRC South
London and partner healthcare organizations. At the time
of application, the ImpRes tool was completed by re-
searchers at varying stages of developing implementation
science expertise following the NIHR CLAHRC South
London ’s launch in 2014. The research projects focused
on a wide range of healthcare areas and ranged fromHull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 4 of 20
hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation studies to pure
implementation research (see ‘Results ’section, Table 3).
To suit the needs and desires of researchers, a pragmatic
and flexible approach was used to apply the ImpRes tool.
For example, some researchers felt confident applying the
ImpRes tool without the guidance of an implementation
scientist (LH), whereas other s lacked confidence in applying
the tool independently and welcomed expert guidance. To
suit the needs of all, research ers were given the option to
either (1) complete the tool independently and then partici-
pate in a one-to-one feedback se ssion after the implementa-
tion scientist had reviewed the completed ImpRes tool, or
(2) complete the tool with direct facilitation provided by
the implementation scientist . Facilitation consisted of
explaining the rationale for developing the ImpRes tool, its
aims and an overview of the ten domains (via one-to-one
or group presentation sessions). Researchers applying the
ImpRes tool were asked to complete ten sections corre-
sponding to the ten domains of ImpRes. A number of
domains require researchers t o provide written responses
in the form of a paragraph (e.g. in the ‘Implementation
Strategies ’domain, researchers were asked to describe the
implementation strategies that they intended to use/had
used). Other sections involve completion of a checklist (e.g.
‘Implementation Outcomes ’and ‘Patient and Public In-
volvement and Engagement ’domains are formatted in the
form of a checklist). Researchers were asked to complete
ImpRes as best as they were able to. Although researchers
were not asked to document the amount of time taken to
c o m p l e t et h eI m p R e st o o l ,w ea r ea w a r et h a tm a n yr e -
searchers invested a considerable amount of time complet-
ing ImpRes, especially when applied prospectively (i.e. at
project design stage).
Stage 3: Evaluation of the ImpRes tool (June 2016 –August
2018)
3a: Questionnaire (June 2016-August 2018)
After completing the ImpRes tool , participating researchers
completed a short questionnai re indicating their level of
agreement with 11 statements relating to the structure,
content and the usefulness of the ImpRes tool. Responses
were provided on 5-point Likert scales, ranging from 1
(strongly disagree )t o5( strongly agree ). For example, partic-
ipants responded to the following statements relating to the
structure and usefulness of ImpRes tool respectively: ‘The
ImpRes tool is easy to understand ’and ‘The ImpRes tool is
useful for identifying project areas where implementation
science is lacking. ’Participants were also encouraged to
provide free-text comments and critique. One question-
naire per ImpRes tool application was completed.
3b: Download figures (April 2018-September 2018)
The ImpRes tool and supplementary guide were made
freely available on the King ’s Improvement Science (KIS)website [ 14] in April 2018 and the Implementation
Science Exchange website [ 17] in May 2018. Since then,
monthly download figures have been collected for both
the ImpRes tool and guide on the KIS website (down-
load figures from the Implementation Science Exchange
website are not available to report as they are not cur-
rently collected by the website owners).
Stage 4: development of the ImpRes supplementary
guide (January 2017 –April 2018)
During application of the ImpRes tool and informal
feedback provided by researchers who had applied the
tool, it became apparent that in order to maximize the
potential benefits, usability and scalability of the ImpRes
tool, a detailed guide to supplement its use was required.
The guide provides the rationale for the inclusion of the
ImpRes tool domains, guidance regarding the applica-
tion of the ImpRes tool and directs researchers to fur-
ther literature and specialist resources.
Results
The process to develop and evaluate the ImpRes tool
and supplementary guide is illustrated in Fig. 1. In what
follows, we present the results corresponding to each
stage of development and evaluation as described in the
methods section and as depicted in Fig. 1. Results report-
ing the development of the ImpRes tool (stage 1) and
guide (stage 4) correspond to the study aims of (1) identi-
fying the core principles and concepts that research teams
should consider when designing high-quality implementa-
tion research and (2) identifying and synthesizing key
methodological/conceptual literature containing guidance
and recommendations for designing and evaluating imple-
mentation research. Results reporting the application
(stage 2) and evaluation of the ImpRes tool (stage 3) cor-
respond to the aim of applying and evaluating a tool that
guides researchers through the key principles and research
design considerations of implementation science when
designing studies.
Overview of the ImpRes tool
The ImpRes tool contains ten domains that experts
agreed, based on current evidence, cover the core principles
and methods of implementation science that researchers
should consider when design ing implementation research
(see Fig. 2).
Stage 1: development of the ImpRes tool
1a: Expert consensus-building brainstorming sessions
The ImpRes tool is organized into ten domains; each do-
main and the rationale underpinning its inclusion is pre-
sented in Table 1.Hull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 5 of 20
1b: Identification of key methodological/conceptual
literature containing implementation research design
guidance and recommendations
Concurrently with the consensus-building brainstorming
sessions and informed by emerging ImpRes domains
(presented above), key methodological and conceptual
articles and reports (both peer-reviewed and non-peer-
reviewed) were identified in relation to each of the 10
ImpRes domains. These are presented in Table 2.
1c: Additional specialist input into specific ImpRes domains
After consulting with experts in the field of PPI and
health economics, several refinements to the ImpRes
tool were made. For example, after consulting with an
expert in PPI in health services research, to ensure that
researchers considered and described involvement and
engagement opportunities at different stages of the re-
search cycle (i.e. from identifying and prioritizing re-
search topics toevaluating impact ), and to distinguish
between the different levels of involvement (i.e.consultation tocollaboration ), responses were tabulated
rather than requesting researchers to describe planned
involvement and engagement activities. Furthermore,
four additional questions were included in the ‘Patient
and Public Involvement ’section of the ImpRes tool, in-
cluding, but not limited to, whether the patients/service
users that researchers intended to involve in their re-
search have formal research training.
1d: Pilot testing and refinement
The tool did not undergo any significant refinements
after piloting. In addition to the refinements based on
specialist expert input (described above), additional feed-
back received by the CIS SAP at subsequent meetings
(March 2016 onwards) and discussions amongst the CIS
Research team, a number of refinements were made to
the ImpRes tool. For example, to improve the usability
of the tool, a number of sections were tabulated (e.g. im-
plementation outcomes, service and patient outcomes,
and economic evaluation domains).

Table 1 ImpRes domains and rationale underpinning inclusion
ImpRes domain Rationale underpinning inclusion
Domain 1: Implementation research
characteristicsIt has been argued that the research-to-practice gap is inflated by the tendency to conduct
research in a step-wise manner from clinical efficacy research, followed by clinical effectiveness
research, and lastly implementation research [ 18–21]. The benefits of simultaneously researching
effectiveness and implementation to promote the more rapid and successful translation of
clinical interventions have been previously described and a hybrid effectiveness -implementation
typology proposed [ 22]. As such, the ImpRes tool encourages researchers to differentiate
between studying the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention (e.g. to improve a
specific service or patient outcome) and stu dying the implementation of an intervention
in a real-world setting (e.g. to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation and
evaluate implementation success and strategies). The ImpRes tool urges researchers to
categorize the degree of focus placed on evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention
and/or implementation success (e.g. from effectiveness -implementation hybrid studies to
pure implementation research [ 22]). The ImpRes tool and guide are not intended to be
overly prescriptive in terms of implementation study design; different designs lend themselves
to different project aims and objectives, as such there is not a one size fits all.
Domain 2: Implementation theories, frameworks
and modelsThe use of implementation theories, frameworks and models is important in implementation
research for multiple reasons including guiding implementation efforts, improving
understanding of implementation determinants and providing a structure to synthesize
findings [ 9]. Furthermore, the use of theories and frameworks enhances the generalizability
of implementation efforts and help to build a cumulative understanding of the nature of
change [ 23] enabling greater replication of evidence-based interventions in other settings.
The underuse, superficial use and misuse of theories and frameworks have been described
as posing a substantial scientific challenge for implementation science [ 9]. ImpRes does not
endorse the use of any particular theory, framework or model as the aims and objectives of
any given implementation research project will determine the appropriateness and relevance
of particular implementation theories, frameworks and models. Depending on the aims and
objectives of an implementation research project, it may be appropriate to apply more than
one theory, framework or model. For example, if a project aims to identify and understand
barriers and enablers to individual behavior change and simultaneously evaluate implementation
efforts, the application of a determinant framewo rk which focuses on individual level determinants,
such as the theoretical domains framework (TDF) [ 24], as well as a framework, such as RE-AIM [ 25],
that can be used to evaluate implementation efforts, would be appropriate. As such, the ImpRes
tool encourages researchers to consider and apply implementation theories, frameworks or models
in implementation research that are appropriate to the aims and objectives of the research.
Domain 3: Determinants of implementation Implementation success is, in part, a function of the context in which implementation efforts
occur. Without a clear understanding of the contextual factors likely to impede or facilitate
implementation efforts, implementation strategies to overcome barriers and maximize
facilitators will not be optimized, thereby reducing the likelihood of implementation success.
The ImpRes tool specifically highlights the consolidated framework for implementation
research (CFIR) [ 26], because CFIR brings together key constructs, derived from multiple
implementation theories, that influence implementation efforts and is one of the most
highly cited implementation determinant frameworks in the field [ 27]. Whilst the ImpRes tool
highlights CFIR, it is important to note that ImpRes does not endorse the use of a particular
determinant framework. Rather than simply describing the context in which implementation
efforts occur, the ImpRes tool prompts research teams to design research to prospectively
and systematically explore the factors that are likely to hinder or facilitate implementation
efforts —including identification of factors commonly present across contexts that impede or
facilitate health intervention implementation. Recent efforts to improve our understanding of
implementation in given contexts have provided a more comprehensive, unified and
structured conceptualization of context, extending beyond simply barriers and facilitators to
implementation [ 28–30].
Domain 4: Implementation strategies Described as constituting the ‘active ingredient ’and ‘how to ’components of
implementation efforts, implementation strategies are regarded as having unparalleled
importance in implementation science [ 31]. A program of research is currently underway to
improve guidance regarding how best to select implementation strategies [ 8,32,33]. The
ImpRes tool and guide aim to advise research teams to prospectively appraise the context in
which they intend to implement evidence-based interventions and subsequently select con-
textually appropriate implementation strategies to maximize implementation success. The
ImpRes tool and guide thus aim to facilitate explicit mapping of implementation strategies to
prospectively identified barriers and facilitators to implementation efforts by signposting
researchers to resources and tools designed to help researchers achieve this.
Domain 5: Service and patient outcomes Researchers working in the field of applied health research will be familiar with, and
understand the importance of, identifying, assessing and measuring relevant service and
patient outcomes (commonly referred to as ‘client outcomes ’in the USA) to determine the
efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. Unless conducting ‘pure ’implementation research
[22], implementation outcomes [ 34], will be evaluated in addition to service and patientHull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 7 of 20
Table 1 ImpRes domains and rationale underpinning inclusion (Continued)
ImpRes domain Rationale underpinning inclusion
outcomes. The ImpRes tool and guide aim to highlight the limitations of only assessing
service and patient outcomes when trying to understand and evaluate implementation. By
making explicit the different types of outcomes an implementation study can assess, the
ImpRes tool and guide facilitate the thinking that patient and service level outcomes are
conceptually distinct from implementation outcomes —thus the need to assess the latter
becomes prominent. In doing so, the ImpRes tool and guide aim to increase awareness that
whilst the assessment and measurement of service and patient outcomes are essential to
determine the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention, they are not sufficient for
understanding implementation success, or failure of an intervention. For example, an
intervention designed to reduce Emergency Department admissions might be found to be
ineffective according to admission data (i.e. service outcomes). However, the intervention
might subsequently be found to be effective, for example, when implemented as intended
(i.e. implemented with fidelity).
Domain 6: Implementation outcomes Implementation outcomes have been defined as ‘the effects of deliberate and purposive
actions to implement new treatments, practices and services and are distinct from service
and client (patient) outcomes. ’[34]. They may focus on a specific level of implementation,
such as system, organization, innovation, provider and patient. Proctor et al. proposed a
working taxonomy of eight implementation outcomes that may be assessed across all levels
of a healthcare system, these include acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption,
fidelity, penetration, implementation cost and sustainability [ 34]. Implementation outcomes
may be assessed using validated measurement instruments, routinely collected data and
qualitative methods. They should be assessed at salient stages of implementation (e.g. early
for adoption, ongoing for penetration, late for sustainability). Furthermore, implementation
strategies should be appropriately aligned to the implementation outcome(s) they intended
to target and improve.
Domain 7: Economic evaluation Implementation actions and strategies will inevitably consume scarce resources that could
be put to other valued uses. Decision makers are therefore likely to want to gain insight into
which options offer the greatest returns, in terms of patient or population health-related
benefits, per $ of resource invested [ 35]. Economic evaluation provides a methodological
framework for examining this question, and for addi ng further insight into the inter-dependencies
between activities, cost, implementation outcomes and patient outcomes [ 36]. While the concept
and importance of costing and consideration to co st-effectiveness in relation to implementation
strategies is not particularly novel, to the best of our knowledge, the ImpRes tool and guide is the
only implementation research tool of its type to provide guidance on data requirements for
costing implementation strategies and how economic evaluation more generally should fit into a
broader implementation evaluation plan.
Domain 8: Stakeholder involvement and
engagementThe ImpRes tool explicitly urges researchers to view implementation research as a genuinely
collaborative undertaking between researchers and stakeholders and therefore stresses the
importance of involving and engaging stakeholders in the process of designing implementation
research. Stakeholders are individuals and groups who are likely to be impacted or affected by
implementation efforts; they may also be influential in determining the success or failure of
implementation efforts (e.g. health service leaders or managers or commissioners). Involving
and engaging stakeholders as part of the study design team helps to ensure that, for example,
suitable implementation strategies and outcomes (both patient, service and implementation
outcomes) are measured; and that an appropriate communication and dissemination plan are
developed.
Domain 9: Patient and public involvement and
engagementPatient and public involvement (PPI) is widely considered a marker of high-quality research
[37]. Evidence suggests that PPI in implementation research is lagging and has not matured
to the same extent as PPI in other areas of health research and as such remains a largely
untapped resource [ 38,39]. The ImpRes tool prompts research teams to distinguish and
consider PPI in isolation to other stakeholder involvement because of its critical importance
in facilitating the implementation of research evid ence into clinical practice and thus maximizing
patient benefit and reducing health inequalitie s. As such, research teams are encouraged to view
implementation research as a partnership betwe en researchers and patients and thus involve
patients and the public in designing implementation research.
Domain 10: Unintended consequences Implementation efforts are often complex, challenging, and unpredictable. Unintended
consequences (both positive and negative) are likely to occur as a result of implementation
efforts; however, unintended consequences of implementation efforts are often not studied
and/or under-reported. Research teams often focus their efforts on quantifying the intended

Stage 2: application of the ImpRes tool
The ImpRes tool was applied to 15 implementation and
improvement science projects, either prospectively or
retrospectively. The ImpRes tool was fully completed for
14 projects and partially completed for one project. The
ImpRes tool was applied independently by researchers
(i.e. without expert guidance) to 14 projects. ImpRes was
applied with the guidance of an implementation scientist
(LH) to the remaining project. The tool developers are
part of the research organization in which the tool was
applied and evaluated. As a large research organization,
the relationship between the tool developers and the
researchers that applied and evaluated the ImpRes tool
was variable. In the majority of cases, the application of
the ImpRes tool was the first meeting between the tool
developers and the lead researcher. The research projects
covered a diverse range of clinical areas, including diabetes,
mental health, dementia and maternity and women ’sh e a l t h .
Two hybrid type 1, five hybrid type 2, three hybrid type 3
and five implementation research projects, as defined by
Curran et al., [ 22], were included. Additional details of each
project can be found in Table 3.
Stage 3: evaluation of the ImpRes tool
3a. Questionnaire
Thirteen out of 15 questionnaires were completed.
Evaluative feedback from researchers on the structure,
content and usefulness of the ImpRes tool is reported in
Table 4. In all but one case (where the researcher stated
that ‘The ImpRes tool is too long ’), the median rating forstatements relating to the structure and content and the
usefulness of the ImpRes tool were above the scale
mid-point (3) thereby indicating that researchers who
applied the ImpRes tool viewed the structure, content
and usefulness of the tool favorably.
Free text comments provided by researchers after
completing the ImpRes tool
Five out of 13 researchers who applied the ImpRes tool,
to 15 individual projects, provided free-text comments.
Suggestions for improvement included expanding the
glossary at the end of the ImpRes tool: ‘Helpful to pro-
vide definitions of “implementation/project team ”and
“stakeholders ”distinction not clear. Also, helpful to pro-
vide definitions of ‘research project ’and ‘improvement
project ’(Researcher 3) ’. One researcher suggested that
the layout of the ImpRes tool needed modification; ‘I
think the layout will need some tweaking to be a bit
more user friendly. I felt that I needed help to clarify
where which responses should go where ’(Researcher 8).
Whilst some researchers thought that the ImpRes tool
was too long, one researcher commented that ImpRes was
necessarily long: ‘The length [of the ImpRes tool] and level
of detail are necessary to capture the complexity of the is-
sues explored ’(Researcher 15). Furthermore, acknowledg-
ing that the ability to successfully conduct and complete
an implementation project depends on the skills, expertise
and experiences of the research team, one researcher sug-
gested including an additional question: ‘There is maybe aTable 2 Key methodological/conceptual articles, reports and resources identified that influenced the content of the ImpRes tool

used in conjunction with the ImpRes tool. The guide aims
to facilitate the use of the ImpRes tool, highlight the im-
portance of implementation science in optimizing the suc-
cessful implementation of evidence-based interventions
into clinical practice, define terminology commonly used
in the implementation science literature and direct re-
searchers to relevant literature and online resources that
can be used to design implementation research. Through-
out the guide, several features designed to support re-
searchers are presented. These include a ‘jargon buster ’
and ‘useful resources ’feature. Each feature, rationale for
inclusion and feature examples are presented in Table 5.
Together with the ImpRes tool, the ImpRes supplemen-
tary guide is free to download via the King ’sI m p r o v e m e n t

Discussion
We developed the ImpRes tool and supplementary guide
to help researchers design high-quality implementation
research. Development of the tool and guide was in-
formed by a consensus-building brainstorming process,
involving an international multidisciplinary expert panel,
and identification of key methodological and conceptual
literature containing design guidance and recommenda-
tions. The ImpRes tool contains ten core domains, repre-
senting core implementation science principles and
concepts that should be reviewed and considered when de-
signing implementation research. Whilst we recommend
that all components of ImpRes are worthy of consideration
by research teams when designing implementation re-
search, we recognize that not a ll sections will be applicable
to, or feasible to explore, in every implementation study.
Rather, each ImpRes domain should be considered stra-
tegically, in the context of the research aims and objectives,
to determine applicability, importance and feasibility. For
example, implementation research , as defined by Curran et
al., 2012, which is focused on the adoption or uptake of a
clinical intervention and as intervention effectiveness is typ-
ically assumed, gathering information on the clinical inter-
vention ’s impact on relevant outcomes is typically not
assessed, as such ImpRes ’‘Service and Patient Outcomes ’
domain would not be applicable to include in such re-
search. To the best of our knowledge, the ImpRes tool and
supplementary guide is the onl y currently available compre-
hensive research design instrument which synthesizes guid-
ance and recommendations for designing high-quality
implementation research.
We envisage that the ImpRes tool and supplementary
guide will increase users ’confidence and ability to design
high-quality implementation research. The results of the
present study support this vision; researchers applying
the ImpRes tool found the tool to be useful in identify-
ing areas where implementation science was lacking inresearch projects and in identifying how the method-
ology of projects could be improved. We anticipate that
research teams who use the ImpRes tool will be more
likely to consider and integrate core principles and con-
cepts of implementation science when designing and
evaluating the implementation of evidence-based health
interventions. We aspire that, in turn, this will contrib-
ute to more successful implementation and evaluation of
evidence-based interventions.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of our research include the application of the
ImpRes tool to a number of implementation and im-
provement science research projects, by researchers with
varying levels of implementation and improvement sci-
ence expertise and across a diverse range of health care
areas, including physical and mental health. Our initial
evaluation of the ImpRes tool found that the tool is ac-
ceptable and feasible to apply. Evaluation of the ImpRes
tool by researchers who applied the tool viewed the
structure, content and usefulness of the tool very favor-
ably; all but one structure evaluation item ( ‘the ImpRes
tool is too long ’) had a median score ≥4/5 and all useful-
ness evaluation items had a median score ≥4/5. Our ini-
tial dissemination efforts (via the King ’s Improvement
Science and Implementation Science Exchange websites)
[14,17] suggest that the ImpRes tool and guide fill an
important capacity building gap; over a 6-month period,
the ImpRes tool and guide have been downloaded over
2600 times.
These findings, however, must be interpreted with
some caution. ImpRes was evaluated by researchers with
varying levels of implementation and improvement sci-
ence expertise and it could be argued that those with
limited implementation science expertise are not best
placed to evaluate the content, structure and usefulness
of the ImpRes tool. That said, the acceptability and
adoption of the ImpRes tool and guide depends on the
views of this large cohort of researchers, the primary
intended end user, who have expertise in applied health
research but lack specialist implementation science
training. Although our evaluation data to date indicates
that experienced applied health researchers, with varying
levels of implementation expertise, believe that ImpRes
is likely to lead to better designed implementation stud-
ies, more robust evidence is needed to assess whether
the ImpRes tool and guide could result into better de-
signed implementation research and improved effective-
ness of interventions. Whilst we plan to investigate the
impact of using the ImpRes tool and guide on the qual-
ity of implementation research in the future, here we re-
port the preliminary findings and our reflections on the
ImpRes tool and guide.Hull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 15 of 20
Table 5 ImpRes guide features, rationale for inclusion and feature examples
ImpRes guide features Rationale for inclusion Feature examples
Jargon buster Implementation science has been described as a ‘tower of
babel ’[70]. To address this issue, a ‘jargon buster ’, providing
widely accepted definitions of commonly used terms in
implementation science is included in the ImpRes guide. It is
hoped that this feature will further promote attempts, and the
need, to bring consistency to terminology used in the field.ImpRes domain: Implementation outcomes
Implementation outcomes have been defined as
‘the effects of deliberate and purposive actions to
implement new treatments, practices, and
services and are distinct from service and client
(patient) outcomes ’Proctor et al., 2011 [ 34].
ImpRes component: Implementation Strategies
Implementation strategies are ‘methods or
techniques used to enhance the adoption,
implementation, and sustainability of a clinical
programme, practice or intervention ’Proctor et
al., 2013 [ 31].
Top tips Implementation science has been described as a growing but
not well understood field of health research [ 71]. To help
address this challenge, a ‘top tips ’feature exists to help
researchers design high-quality implementation research. Whilst
these ‘tips’are embedded within the literature, it is hoped that
the ‘top tips ’feature will ensure that existing design
recommendations will be brought to the forefront of researchers ’
minds when designing implementation research.ImpRes domain: Implementation theories,
framework and models
Depending on the nature and aim(s) of your
implementation research, it might be
appropriate to use more than one theory,
framework or model. For example, if your
research aims to identify barriers to
implementation as well as evaluating
implementation, selecting an implementation
determinant framework as well as an
implementation evaluation framework would
be appropriate.
Keep an eye out Implementation science is a rapidly advancing field with much
work currently being conducted to address lack of design
guidance. The ‘keep an eye out ’feature signposts researchers ’
to research that is currently being conducted that is not yet
completed/published.ImpRes domain: Implementation strategies
A team of implementation scientists are
currently developing the Implementation
Technique Selection tool to ‘guide the selection
of individual strategies that can be bundled or
packaged together into an overall implementation
strategy ’. For more information, click here: http://
cfirguide.org/techniques.html [72]
Useful references Many peer-review publications exist that have the potential to
increase knowledge and understan ding and guide methodological
decisions in implementation research. It is hoped this feature will
signpost researchers to key peer-reviewed publications that can be
used to guide the design of implementation research.ImpRes domain: Implementation theories,

and sustainment of evidence-based practice.Hull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 16 of 20
Furthermore, we identified a number of barriers that are
likely to affect adoption, implementation and sustainment
of the ImpRes tool, including a lack of awareness amongst
applied health researchers of implementation science to im-
prove the implementation of ev idence-based interventions.
Moreover, ImpRes was applied and evaluated within a re-
search organization: NIHR CLAHRC South London. Fu-
ture evaluation studies should explore the generalizability
and scalability, as well as the barriers and enablers, of the
ImpRes tool and guide in other research settings (e.g. out-
side of large, multi-million- pound funded research organi-
zations such as NIHR CLAHRCs and research cutting
across health and social care settings). The researchers who
developed the ImpRes tool developed and distributed the
questionnaire that was used for the preliminary evaluation
and analyzed the questionnair ed a t ar e t u r n e d .A l t h o u g ha
point was made of welcoming participants ’comments and
critiques to help us to modify/refine the content of ImpRes
tool, we are aware a social desirability bias may be present
in the evaluation data.
Reflections on implementing the ImpRes tool
Barriers to implementing the ImpRes tool Applying
the ImpRes tool retrospectively (i.e. to research projects
that had already been completed or were underway)
proved to be an unmotivating task to researchers and is
likely to explain the reluctance and lack of engagement
of a number of researchers/research themes that were
approached, but declined, to apply the ImpRes tool to
their projects. This is not unexpected considering that
research projects already completed would not directly
benefit from applying the ImpRes tool, i.e. it was not
possible to amend and improve the design of implemen-
tation or improvement science research as the research
was already underway or had been completed. Like
many applied health researchers, several researchers
lacked awareness/familiarity with implementation sci-
ence. This is likely to have resulted in some reluctance
to commit the time needed to complete the ImpRes tool.
Whilst we believe that the content of the ImpRes tool
and guide is appropriate across all types of implementa-
tion research, the presentation of information may need
to be revised, perhaps shortened, to better suit
practitioner-researchers based outside of an academic
research organization. Without education to establish
awareness of the importance of implementation science
in implementing evidence-based interventions, this bar-
rier is likely to prevent the adoption, implementation
and sustainability of the ImpRes tool. Furthermore, the
ImpRes tool was perceived by some as a research-heavy
tool targeted more at large-scale academic research ra-
ther than more applied, small-scale, pragmatic projects
(e.g. improvement/spread projects). Such perceptionswere expressed predominately by those who applied the
ImpRes tool to projects being conducted outside of a
university setting (i.e. Health Innovation Network) rather
than those who applied the tool to projects being con-
ducted within a university setting (i.e. King ’s College
London). Again, this is likely to have resulted in some
reluctance to commit the time needed to complete the
ImpRes tool.
Facilitators to implementing the ImpRes tool Pro-
spective application to projects that were in the design
phase, and amenable to design change, and to grant
applications that were being drafted for submission, per-
haps unsurprisingly proved to be a factor motivating the
application of ImpRes. The benefits of applying ImpRes
were clear and immediate. Researchers who were ac-
tively encouraged by principal investigators (PIs) to
apply the ImpRes tool were far more likely and moti-
vated to do so than researchers who were approached
on an individual basis and who had not received direct
encouragement from PIs. Furthermore, researchers who
were aware and interested in implementation science
and implementation research yet felt they lacked the
knowledge and skills to design implementation research
welcomed the ImpRes tool, together with the support
and facilitation of the lead researcher (LH), to structure
the process of designing implementation research.
Planned ImpRes research and development
Literature in the field of implementation science is a
rapidly advancing. To ensure the ImpRes tool and guide
include the most up-to-date guidance for designing and
evaluating implementation research, we plan to review
and update the tool and guide annually; the next review
will be in April 2019. We are currently designing a for-
mal international expert Delphi study, drawing upon a
wider international expert panel, to formally content val-
idate and refine the ImpRes tool and supplementary
guide. Alongside this, we are currently developing quan-
titative scoring criteria for each of the ImpRes domains.
The scoring criteria will provide a systematic and trans-
parent rating system that will allow us to empirically
determine whether applying the ImpRes tool and guide
improves the quality of implementation research. We
hope the scoring criteria will also be of benefit to mul-
tiple implementation research stakeholders (e.g. re-
searchers, funders and decision-makers). For example,
we envisage this scoring system to be of use to funders
and decision-makers wishing to evaluate the quality of
implementation research proposals allowing the differ-
entiation between lower and higher quality implementa-
tion research proposals. Additionally, we hope that the
scoring criteria will be of use and support researchers to
improve the quality of their implementation researchHull et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:80 Page 17 of 20
proposal by identifying project areas that require im-
provement. Furthermore, researchers who have imple-
mentation science expertise may also benefit from using
the ImpRes tool and guide. The initial intention of the
ImpRes tool and guide at the inception stage was to sup-
port those researchers who have no or limited expertise
in implementation science research; however, we ac-
knowledge and plan to evaluate the benefits of applying
the ImpRes tool and guide for applied health researchers
who have implementation science expertise.
Conclusion
We have developed a new and promising educational tool
and supplementary guide to help overcome the many chal-
lenges that applied health researchers face when attempting
to design implementation research. We believe that adopt-
ing the ImpRes tool and guide will improve the quality of
implementation research, in turn advancing the field and
leading to optimized implementation of evidence-based
interventions and ultimately improved service and patient
outcomes.
