Abstract
Background: While people who are homeless often experience poor mental and physical health and problem
substance use, getting access to appropriate services can be challenging. The development of trusting relationships
with non-judgemental staff can facilitate initial and sustained engagement with health and wider support services.
Peer-delivered approaches seem to have particular promise, but there is limited evidence regarding peer
interventions that are both acceptable to, and effective for, people who are homeless and using drugs and/or
alcohol. In the proposed study, we will develop and test the use of a peer-to-peer relational intervention with
people experiencing homelessness. Drawing on the concept of psychologically informed environments, it will focus
on building trusting and supportive relationships and providing practical elements of support such as access to
primary care, treatment and housing options.

Methods: A mixed-method feasibility study with concurrent process evaluation will be conducted to explore the
feasibility and acceptability of a peer-delivered, relational intervention for people with problem substance use who are
homeless. Peer Navigators will be based in homelessness outreach and residential services in Scotland and England.
Peer Navigators will work with a small number of participants for up to 12 months providing both practical and
emotional support. The sample size for the intervention is 60. Those receiving the intervention must be currently
homeless or at risk of homelessness, over the age of 18 years and self-report alcohol/drug problems. A holistic health
check will be conducted in the first few months of the intervention and repeated towards the end. Health checks will
be conducted by a researcher in the service where the Peer Navigator is based. Semi-structured qualitative interviews
with intervention participants and staff in both intervention and standard care settings, and all Peer Navigators, will be
conducted to explore their experiences with the intervention. Non-participant observation will be conducted in
intervention and standard care sites to document similarities and differences between care pathways.
Discussion: The SHARPS study will provide evidence regarding whether a peer-delivered harm reduction intervention
is feasible and acceptable to people experiencing homelessness and problem substance use in order to develop a
definitive trial.

Background
Homelessness is a complex issue that often involves deep so-
cial exclusion. This is a term whi ch refers to intersections of
experiences of homelessness, s ubstance use, institutional
care, and ‘street culture ’activities such as begging and street
drinking [ 1]. Estimates suggest that 307,000 people in the
UK [ 2], 550,000 in the USA [ 3] and 235,000 in Canada [ 4]
experience homelessness at any one point, and these rates
have been increasing. Homelessness can be viewed as being
caused by ‘individualistic ’or‘structural ’conditions, with
different explanations favoured by different countries [ 5].
Poverty and other factors, such as traumatic childhood expe-
riences, imprisonment and institutional care, are central to
the causes of homelessness [ 5,6]. Homelessness can be
viewed as both created and ex acerbated by systemic changes
in housing and social systems, combined with situational fac-
tors, that make those with the least power and resources vul-
nerable to becoming homeless [ 5].
People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to
‘tri-morbidity ’, with poor mental and physical health and
problem substance use [ 7]. The use of alcohol and drugs
is often a factor contributing to someone becoming
homeless and can increase as a way of coping with it [ 8].
People who are homeless often report far worse physical
and mental health than the general population [ 9–11]
and are four times more likely to die prematurely and
seven times more likely to die as a result of drug use,
than the general population [ 12]. Despite many people
who are homeless in the UK being registered with a
General Practitioner (GP), a significant number report
that they are not receiving help with their health prob-
lems [ 13]: they do not access healthcare services until a
crisis emerges, utilising accident and emergency services
rather than primary care [ 7,14–16]. This can be costlyto healthcare funders [ 7,17]. Further, when people who are
homeless do access mainstream healthcare or substance
use services, their needs are not well met. They often ex-
perience stigma and negativ e attitudes from staff, are
viewed as second class citizens, and encounter inflexible
services that do not meet their needs [ 14,15,18,19]. Col-
laborative working between h ealthcare and housing services
is therefore essential [ 20], and interventions to improve the
health of people who are homeless have received increased
a t t e n t i o ni nt h el a s td e c a d e[ 21]. Several systematic reviews
have examined the effectiveness of interventions to improve
health and substance use outcomes for those who are
homeless with findings indicating that having primary care
services tailored to those experiencing homelessness [ 22],
case management [ 9,21,23] and provision of housing [ 21],
can be effective in improving mental and physical health
and assisting with problem substance use.
In terms of problem substance use, treatment ap-
proaches have traditionally been divided into those
aimed at helping people stop using alcohol and drugs,
with abstinence being the goal, and those taking a harm
reduction approach first and foremost [ 24]. More re-
cently, there has been a move away from understanding
these approaches as distinct and separate. That said,
there have been questions raised regarding whether or
not abstinence-focused interventions are appropriate for
people with very complex health and substance use needs
[22], such as people who are homeless. While abstinence-
based interventions can be effective for some, they rely on
people who are homeless having access to services and re-
sources, which can be very difficult. Unstable living condi-
tions can mean that treatment appointments are missed and
p l a n sa n dr e g i m e sc h a l l e n g i n gt om a i n t a i n[ 14]. For most
people experiencing homelessness who use alcohol andParkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 2 of 15
drugs, abstinence is unlikely to be achieved in the short term,
so approaches that reduce the harms associated with use are
needed [ 24–26]. It has been recommended that harm reduc-
tion approaches be specifically employed to prevent harms
related to substance use, with abstinence-based treatment
a v a i l a b l ea sa no p t i o n[ 25]. Harm reduction aims to support
people ‘w h e r et h e ya r ea t ’, where substance use is met with a
non-judgemental response. Intervention is concerned to pre-
vent harms of use, rather than seeking particular goals [ 27].
This can facilitate more autonomy because importance is
placed on people exercising choice to set their own goals;
they are not forced to reduce use or be abstinent [ 27–29].
Harm reduction services can also act as a ‘gateway ’to other
services, including to health and housing services, and spe-
cialised substance use treatment [ 30,31]. For those who are
h o m e l e s s ,t h e r ei san e e df o raw i d er a n g eo fa p p r o a c h e sa n d
services to reduce risks including of fatal and non-fatal over-
dose, including the provision of overdose awareness training
and naloxone, heroin-assiste d treatment, drug consumption
rooms and assertive outreach services [ 32].
In harm reduction services, the building of trusting re-
lationships with staff in services is key, as is the import-
ance of service user-directed goals and being accepted as
a person [ 28,33]. Participation of people who use drugs
(peers) is an essential element of harm reduction ser-
vices and one of its key principles [ 34,35]. Services that
are accessible, with staff who are good listeners and have
caring, non-judgemental attitudes, can facilitate engage-
ment with a range of population groups who can be re-
luctant to engage with mainstream services [ 36,37] for a
range of reasons. A very basic but essential point that
has been highlighted in studies on harm reduction and
substance use is that people should be treated like human
beings with worth [ 27,33] which is not necessarily what
this group of people experience when they access health,
specialist substance use or social services [ 38,39]. The de-
velopment of trusting, consistent and reliable relationships
is also essential for those experiencing homelessness in
order to facilitate access to services [ 27,29,33,40,41].
Neale and Stevenson interviewed people who were
homeless with drug and alcohol problems living in hos-
tels to examine the nature and extent of their social and
recovery capital [ 42]. Participants viewed supportive re-
lationships with professionals as critical to their well-
being and future outcomes. Hostel staff were noted as
going ‘above and beyond ’what was expected from them:
being caring and responsive to needs and protecting
people [ 42]. Developing good relationships between
healthcare professionals and those who are homeless has
also been found to be especially important for engage-
ment, particularly when dealing with individuals with
substance use and other health problems [ 22,43]. Mills
et al. interviewed staff working in homelessness primary
care services in the UK and found that the developmentof trusting relationships, and listening to people well,
was crucial to engagement of people experiencing home-
lessness [ 18]. Importantly, when people who are home-
less developed good relationships with healthcare
professionals, they would bring friends with them, thus
extending reach [ 18]. Pauly has also highlighted the im-
portance of trusting relationships as essential to access
to primary care in Canada [ 44]. This literature has much
in common with research on effective approaches for
those experiencing homelessness and mental health prob-
lems highlighting the importance of flexible services, good
relationships with professionals, care based on mutual
communication and advocacy, practical support and hav-
ing workers with lived experience [ 45]. Services viewed as
unhelpful included those where staff were viewed as
judgemental, lacking compassion and ‘clinically detached ’,
and used medical models of care. Refusing to give support
because of substance use is also featured [ 45].
A recent development in homelessness settings is the
use of a psychologically informed framework called psy-
chologically informed environements (PIEs) to develop
services for people with complex histories to enable ‘the
best chance of sustainably escaping the cycle of poor
wellbeing and chronic homelessness ’[46]. The explicitly
relational focus, working actively with a person ’s experi-
ences of trauma and ensuing emotional impact, lies at
the core of PIEs [ 47], where the coping strategies that
people develop to survive, including use of substances,
are understood in this context. PIEs aim to help people
to make changes to behaviours on their own terms using
supportive relationships [ 47]. The five key areas of PIEs
are developing a psychological framework, the physical
environment and space, staff training and support, man-
aging relationships and evaluation of outcomes [ 46]. Ser-
vices implementing a PIE approach may change their
reception areas to make them feel safer and more invit-
ing, provide staff with opportunities for reflective prac-
tice and review eviction protocols [ 46]. Currently, there
is limited research on PIEs, so this study will provide a
novel and potentially unique empirical contribution to
the field.
It is also important to acknowledge the vital contribu-
tion made by those with lived experience to relational
interventions in the housing/homelessness and health-
care fields. Peer support workers have been successfully
placed into mental health settings, and there is evidence
that they can improve outcomes for those using services,
particularly in terms of giving hope, facilitating em-
powerment and self-esteem [ 48,49]. In terms of sub-
stance use, peers are involved in harm reduction and
recovery services in a range of ways, including the
provision of safer injection advice [ 10,50]; running safe
injecting sites, needle and syringe exchange and out-
reach programmes [ 51–54]; information about drugParkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 3 of 15
quality [ 55]; provision of take-home naloxone [ 10,56];
and advocacy across a range of political and public
arenas [ 57–59]. In their systematic review, Marshall and
colleagues identified 36 different roles of peers in harm
reduction initiatives, highlighting the diversity of in-
volvement [ 60]. The involvement of peers in these ser-
vices is considered to be highly beneficial in terms of
facilitating engagement with services [ 31,61]; increased
access to, and engagement with, health and social care
services and addiction treatment [ 52,62]; adherence to
antiretroviral therapy [ 63]; and reduced drug-related
deaths [ 10] through the development of trusting rela-
tionships [ 61,64–67]. Peer-delivered interventions have
also been found to be effective, compared to more trad-
itional outreach interventions, in reducing the risks asso-
ciated with injecting drug use [ 68,69]. Those who use
drugs are willing and able to access peer-delivered ser-
vices [ 70], and the peers offering services themselves re-
port a range of benefits [ 71].
Peers have also been involved in research in the fields
of substance use and homelessness [ 60]. Peer research
has been argued to be ethically imperative, particularly
in areas of social exclusion and potential objectification
[72]. As Terry and Cardwell note: ‘Peer research is based
on the assumption that shared experiences bring a
unique quality to research; an understanding and em-
pathy that results in a higher quality and more meaning-
ful research process ’[73]. Accessible role models can
help to challenge stigmatising views of people who use
drugs and are homeless [ 74].
Peer support roles have also been developed and sup-
ported in homelessness settings in the UK (Cyrenians, St
Mungo ’s, Shelter and Groundswell), although rigorous
evaluation is sparse [ 74]. O’Campo et al. examined the
literature on community-based services for people who
were homeless and experiencing mental health and sub-
stance use problems and found that, in one programme,
peer support staff were particularly effective in develop-
ing good relationships with service users [ 43]. Research
indicates that while peer workers benefit from their role
in terms of increased confidence and self-esteem, and as
a way of reintegrating into the community [ 64], there
can also be challenges in terms of a lack of boundaries,
power imbalances, stress, unclear roles, tensions over
professionalism and dealing with challenging behaviours
[48,64,75]. Effective training, supportive and reflective
supervision and management, clear role descriptions and
acceptable pay, are all important in addressing such
challenges [ 48,64,75,76].
Taken together, these studies highlight the importance
of particular components of harm reduction that can
contribute to engaging well with people who are margin-
alised within mainstream health, social and housing ser-
vices. The critical component to both good engagement,and subsequent progress on self-identified life goals,
seems to be the facilitation of trusting, supportive rela-
tionships where there are also practical elements of sup-
port provided, such as access to primary care and
housing options. Non-judgemental attitudes are noted to
be vital in engaging people with complex needs in
healthcare, including those with problem alcohol and
drug use experiencing or at risk for homeless. Despite a
clear need for tailored harm reduction services for
people who experience both homelessness and problem
substance use, there is limited evidence regarding how
harm reduction and health services are experienced by
this group of people who are vulnerable to a range of
health and social harms. The study described here aims
to address this evidence gap.
Study aims and objectives
The SHARPS (Supporting Harm Reduction through
Peer Support) study is a feasibility and acceptability trial
of a relational peer-delivered intervention to support
people who are homeless to address a range of health
and social issues on their own terms. The study aims to
examine whether it is feasible to deliver a peer-to-peer
intervention (by ‘Peer Navigators ’) based on PIEs that
provides practical and emotional support for people ex-
periencing homelessness and problem substance use in
non-NHS settings. In this study, ‘Peer Navigators ’are
those with lived experience of homelessness and/or
problem substance use who are employed as specialist
support workers to provide emotional and practical sup-
port to individuals and help them to engage with rele-
vant services. Similar roles have been implemented
elsewhere [ 77,78]. Holistic health checks using standar-
dised measures of physical and mental health, and mea-
sures of quality of life, relationships, and recovery, will
also be conducted. It will assess the acceptability of the
intervention, its ability to engage people, and appraise a
range of critical intervention requirements that need to
be fully understood before proceeding to a definitive
trial. This article details the protocol of the SHARPS
study and follows the recommendations of the Standard
Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional
Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 guidance [ 79] (please see Fig. 1for
the SPIRIT flowchart and Additional file 1: Table S1 for
the SPIRIT checklist).
The study objectives are:
/C15To develop and implement a non-randomised, peer-
delivered, relational intervention, drawing on princi-
ples of PIEs, that aims to reduce harms and improve
health/wellbeing, quality of life and social function-
ing, for people who are homeless with problem sub-
stance useParkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 4 of 15
/C15To conduct a concurrent process evaluation, in
preparation for a potential randomised controlled trial
(RCT), assess all procedures for their acceptability,
and analyse important intervention requirements
such as fidelity, rate of recruitment and retention of
participants, appropriate sample size and potential
follow-up rates, the ‘fit’with chosen settings and tar-
get population, availability and quality of data and
suitability of outcome measures.
The study will answer the following research questions:
/C15Is a peer-delivered, relational harm reduction ap-
proach accessible and acceptable to, and feasible for,
people who are homeless with problem substance
use in non-NHS settings?
/C15If so, what adaptations, if any, would be required to
facilitate adoption in wider NHS and social care
statutory services?
/C15What outcome measures are most relevant and
suitable to assess the effect of this intervention in a
full RCT?/C15Are participants and staff/service settings involved
in the intervention willing to be randomised?
/C15On the basis of study findings, is a full RCT merited
to test the effectiveness of the intervention?
Study design and methods
The intervention (health technology) being assessed in
this feasibility and acceptability non-randomised study is
a peer-delivered, relational intervention for people who
are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless, with
problem substance use. The intervention, informed by
the concept of PIEs, will provide practical and emotional
support for a period of up to 12 months (between 2 and
12 months depending on the setting). Initially, support
was to be provided for up to 12 months in all settings,
but a small group of participants ( n= 10) will receive a
shortened intervention of 2/2.5 months due to one of
the Peer Navigators leaving the role early. Peer Naviga-
tors will support participants to stabilise their lives
through the development of trusting relationships along-
side creating opportunities with them to access valuable
resources that can also contribute to stabilisation.Fig. 1 Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional TrialsParkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 5 of 15
The centrality of relationships within PIEs lies at the
heart of our intervention. As there is limited research
specifically on both PIEs and relationships, our use of
this concept in the study will provide a novel and unique
empirical contribution to the field. Peer Navigators will
help people engage with services that are tailored to
their health and social needs on their own terms, for ex-
ample in ensuring that they are registered with GPs,
dentists and optician services, if they wish to be, and re-
ceive appropriate assessments by such services. Import-
antly, the intervention will be co-produced in phase 1 of
the study with a range of collaborators with selected ex-
pertise, and a detailed intervention guide created (more
detail provided in the intervention section below).
When the relationship with the Peer Navigators has
developed, and participants are willing, a holistic health
check will be undertaken by researchers. The purpose of
these measures (detailed below) is to capture an overall
picture of the health of individual participants, ideally at
two time points, and ascertain acceptability and com-
pleteness of the separate measures for a definitive trial.
Onward referral to specialist services will be supported
by the Peer Navigators, as required, and support will be
offered for up to 12 months (between 2 and 12 months
depending on the setting), and not withdrawn on the
basis of continued problem substance use or abstinence.
The comparator will be two standard care sites, and the
health care check measures will be conducted by re-
searchers with a sample of residents/service users in
these settings. The study comprises three main phases.
Phase 1 (months 1 –3) will address objectives 1 and 2:
1. Develop an intervention using co-production
methods for use in community outreach/hostel
settings
2. Create a manual to guide the intervention and an
associated staff training manual
Phase 2 (months 4 –21) is a non-randomised feasibility
study that will deliver the co-produced intervention in
six third sector intervention sites and address the follow-
ing objectives:
3. Test the feasibility of recruiting to the intervention
and measure the rate of recruitment/attrition in
order to determine appropriate sample size and
follow-up rates for a full RCT
4. Deliver a non-randomised, peer-delivered, relational
intervention based on principles of PIEs, with integral
holistic health checks (conducted by researchers)
based on already identified outcome measures
5. Assess the acceptability and feasibility of all
procedures in the intervention using normalisation
process theory (NPT), including staff andparticipant perceptions of its value, strengths and
challenges
6. Assess the acceptability of the holistic health
checks/outcome measures, to determine the best
way to measure outcomes for this particular
intervention and population in a future RCT
7. Assess fidelity, adherence to the manual, ‘fit’to
context, and data availability and quality, and
potential for wider adoption to NHS/statutory
health and social care services.
Phase 3 (months 18 –24) will involve the analysis and
write-up of all study findings to address our research ob-
jectives 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 (listed above), focusing on evaluat-
ing factors needed to deliver the intervention at scale. In
addition, the intervention manual/training guidance will
be refined to ensure that it is fit for purpose for a wider
rollout in a range of settings, and for a definitive trial.
NPT [ 80] will provide a framework for the evaluation
given that it is particularly suited to evaluating complex
health interventions by providing a means of understand-
ing and improving the way that interventions are imple-
mented [ 80]. There are four NPT constructs: coherence,
cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive
monitoring [ 81]: Coherence refers to the process of under-
standing that individuals/organisations go through to ei-
ther endorse or prevent an intervention being embedded
into practice, cognitive participation involves enrolling
and engaging individuals in the new practice, collective ac-
tion is the work that individuals/organisations do to
embed the new intervention into practice and reflexive
monitoring refers to formal and informal appraisal of the
new practice [ 80,81]. In this study, NPT will facilitate
analysis of how staff adopt/perceive the intervention, how
those receiving it engage, how the Peer Navigators make
sense of their role and other contextual factors impacting
delivery. Using NPT will enable a better understanding of
the intervention from the perspectives of all involved and
inform a definitive trial.
Settings
Three homeless outreach services in Lothian, Scotland,
and three hostels in Liverpool and Bradford, England,
were chosen for implementation of this intervention. All
hosting services are non-profit, third sector housing or-
ganisations. To enable assessment of the differences be-
tween intervention and non-intervention care pathways,
we have identified two standard care settings that are
similar to the intervention sites, e.g. third sector/type of
funding/types of staff roles and numbers in place/aims
of service. Whether the settings are comparable will be
explored in the process evaluation. As non-statutory,
third sector services, developed to meet the needs of
their specific populations, it will be highly unlikely thatParkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 6 of 15
any service is completely comparable. In the two stand-
ard care sites, the same health check measures will be
used with a sample of residents/service users in order to
assess population differences and the acceptability of use
of measures outside of the context of our intervention.
We will also undertake non-participant observation in
both intervention and standard care sites to document
similarities/differences between care pathways. Interro-
gating the role of context will be key to our understand-
ing of how the intervention works, most specifically in
terms of the role of each of the services in hosting the
Peer Navigators and the study and particular facilitators
and barriers to the intervention.
Recruitment and eligibility assessment
Recruitment to the intervention will be an ongoing
process until the desired sample size of 60 participants is
reached (see below for a discussion on sample size), or
until the mid April 2019 (combining two trial recruit-
ment strategies identified by Thoma et al. [ 82]). As de-
scribed in the feasibility study conducted by Ferguson
and Xie, for each participant that leaves the study, a new
participant will be invited to engage in the intervention
[83] until the ‘cutoff ’point of mid April 2019. In the
event that there are more than 60 people who wish to
take part, a waiting list will be kept so that if a partici-
pant drops out, a new person can be engaged until the
‘cutoff ’date.
To be eligible, participants must be currently homeless
or at risk of homelessness, over the age of 18 years,
self-report alcohol or drug problems (with participants
themselves recognising that their substance use is a prob-
lem for them, prompted by questions such as ‘do you use
alcohol or drugs? do you see this as a problem for you? ’)
and able to provide informed consent. The Peer Naviga-
tors will identify participants through the service in which
they work, and from the outreach activities that they en-
gage in, and from other referral points such as healthcare
professionals and other agencies working in the local en-
vironment. A collaborative process will take place, to dis-
cuss the eligibility of each participant who is approached,
between the Peer Navigator and the Service Managers in
each of the study settings who line manage the Peer Navi-
gator, in partnership with the study Chief Investigator and
the study team.
Two Peer Navigators are based in three homelessness
outreach services in Scotland and two are based in three
hostels (Lifehouses) in the north of England. Two stand-
ard care sites have been selected, one in Scotland (third
sector outreach service run by one of the providers of the
intervention sites serving clients with similar needs) and
one in England (third sector hostel run by one of the pro-
viders of the intervention sites serving clients with similar
needs), that are comparable to the intervention sites inkey ways (e.g. the needs of the client base, geographical
area, staffing levels, organisational ethos and culture) but
will not have a Peer Navigator located within them.
Consent
All identified eligible intervention participants in the
study intervention settings will be approached by the
Peer Navigators and provided with a Participant Infor-
mation Sheet and then asked to provide written in-
formed consent at least 48 h later if they wish to join the
intervention. Participants are advised that they might be
approached at a later point regarding participating in the
associated qualitative data collection (interviews) elem-
ent of the study. This will be a separate process of pro-
viding information and then gaining informed consent;
only a sub-set will be involved in this aspect of the study.
These interviews will be conducted by Peer Researchers,
who have been recruited and trained by the Scottish
Drugs Forum (SDF). These individuals are separate from,
and unknown to, the Peer Navigators. The Peer Re-
searchers will have lived experience of problem substance
use and will receive training in research methods, the
study methods and the intervention. Interviews will also
be conducted with staff in the intervention and standard
care sites and with the Peer Navigators. (Examples of the
Participant Information Sheets and consent forms are pro-
vided as Additional files 2and3).
Participants will be asked to state that they accept and
understand limitations to confidentiality within the
qualitative interviews and/or support discussions with
Peer Navigators. These limitations refer to information
about knowledge of harm or abuse to someone including
the participant. If such disclosures do occur, this infor-
mation will be shared with senior members of staff in
each setting who will conduct a risk assessment as per
their duty of care. In the event of this situation occur-
ring, the person taking the disclosure will call the Chief
Investigator, with an adverse event form being
completed.
Sampling, sample size and data collection
As this is a feasibility and acceptability study, no formal
power calculation is required [ 84]. We aim to recruit 60
people to the intervention. This sample size was deter-
mined on the basis that, although sample sizes of between
30 and 50 have been recommended for feasibility studies
[85,86], we expect a degree of attrition because of the un-
stable nature of participants ’lives. In consultation with
clinical colleagues, we slightly inflated our sample size
based on the likelihood of 10 –15% attrition to ensure par-
ticipant volume [ 82]. While this sample is deemed a man-
ageable caseload for the Peer Navigators, this will be
carefully assessed as part of the process evaluation.Parkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 7 of 15
There are a number of different samples for data col-
lection within the process evaluation:
/C15All consenting intervention participants ( n= 60) will
have quantitative data collected through the holistic
health checks
/C15A purposive sub-sample ( n=2 0 –25) of intervention
participants will be asked to participate in semi-
structured interviews (conducted by Peer Re-
searchers), ideally at two time points if available/

complete a short questionnaire provided by Service
Managers, which covers some key questions about
their experiences in working with the Peer
Navigator
/C15All four Peer Navigators (using criterion sampling)
will participate in semi-structured interviews at
three time points
/C15Service staff in both intervention and standard care
settings ( n= 16) will be identified using purposive
sampling and asked to participate in semi-structured
interviews
The purposive approach to sampling of the intervention
participants for qualitative interviews will take account of
the diversity of settings, gender, age, race/ethnicity, and
the presence of disability or significant health concern, al-
cohol or drug use as main problem substance.
A small number of Peer Researchers will conduct qualita-
tive semi-structured interviews with the sub-sample of
intervention participants to examine their views on the
intervention. Our team believes that participants in the
intervention will be more comfortable speaking with some-
one who has been through similar life experiences and that
this will lead to ‘richer ’,m o r e ‘valid ’data being gathered in
relation to participant experiences of the intervention [ 87].
The Peer Researchers will be qualified partly on the basis of
the lived experience of problem substance use and/or
homelessness. They will be recruited by SDF from their
wider pool of Peer Researchers, and although trained in re-
search methods, they will be further trained in the SHARPS
study methods and intervention. They will be actively sup-
ported by a User Involvement Officer from SDF on site
during interviews. Interviews w ill take place where partici-
pants are willing/available at two time points, in the early
to middle phase (January –April 2019) and then towards
the end of the intervention (August –September 2019), to
explore whether perceptions change over time.
Research team members will identify and recruit the
wider service staff ( n= 16) and participant ( n=2 0–25)
samples at each of the six intervention sites and two
standard care sites. The research team members will con-
duct all staff interviews. Staff samples will be purposive,based on diversity of setting, role within service, disciplin-
ary background, gender and age. Qualitative interviews
will be undertaken with all four Peer Navigators at three
time points (beginning —June 2019, middle —April 2019
and end —November 2019) by research team members to
assess changes in perception and practice. Please see
Table 1for more details on sampling, recruitment and
data collection.
Intervention and intervention guide/manual
Another important dimension of this study is the
co-production of the intervention at the start of the study.
The intervention and intervention guide/manual will be
co-produced by experts in homelessness, inclusion health,
and PIEs and relational interventions; representatives from
homelessness and third sector organisations; peers and
people who have experienced homelessness and/or prob-
lem substance use via our Experts by Experience group
and the Peer Navigators; and relevant health/medical pro-
fessionals, following INVOLVE guidance [ 88]. We will do
this by convening a full-day meeting to discuss the key
components of the intervention and how these will be im-
plemented. During this meeting, we will plan for the inter-
vention end point in a way that is sensitive to the fact that
participants who engage will have experienced many other
relationship losses. We will aim to ensure that participants
are connected to other support agencies before the inter-
vention ends.
Following this full-day meeting, the study team will
develop draft versions of the intervention and training
manuals for circulation to all parties. We will work
closely with all organisations and individuals, including
the Peer Navigators, to ensure that these documents
meet the needs of the target group, drawing on current
literature and stakeholders ’own experience of working
in the field and/or accessing services as a service user.
The intervention manual will provide the Peer Naviga-
tors with the necessary information to carry out their
roles, with detailed information about particular con-
cepts and approaches; health and social issues affecting
participants; study information; the intervention; and key
contacts and local information. Service-based line managers
of the Peer Navigators will als o receive their own copies for
reference. In line with other relationship-based therapies,
manualisation of the intervention will be flexible rather
than completely structured, a s rigid approaches can reduce
effectiveness, but will include instruction on PIEs, health
check/measures and referra l pathways. The manual/guid-
ance will be further refined po st-intervention and evalu-
ation as one of the study outputs.
Four part-time (30 h per week, 18-month contracts)
Peer Navigators will be employed by the lead partner
agency, paid on a Specialist Support Worker rate, and
have the same terms and conditions as other staff in theParkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 8 of 15
organisation, including the right to continuing profes-
sional development as part of their roles. The Peer Navi-
gators will provide a non-judgemental relationship and
practical and emotional support for each recruited partici-
pant for a period of between 2 and 12 months, depending
on the setting. The support provided will consist of sup-
port regarding the reduction of harms/potential for acces-
sing treatment related to a person ’s substance use,
physical and mental health, housing, relationships with
family, developing skills and hobbies, and training and
education. The Peer Navigators will work with partici-
pants to identify these support needs and to put in place
referrals, support to attend appointments, support to build
relationships with new services and so on. As part of the
proposal development work, the importance of practical
support to attend appointments was highlighted by our
experts by experience advisers consulted as part of the
proposal development. In order to provide participants
with this practical support, the Peer Navigators will haveaccess to small amounts of petty cash held in the service
settings. Support will be offered for up to 12 months (2 –
12 months depending on the setting), and not withdrawn
on the basis of continued problem substance use or ab-
stinence. Towards the end of the intervention, the Peer
Navigators will have a conversation with participants to
identify an ‘exit strategy ’in terms of their support needs in
the months until and after the end of the intervention.
Figure 2shows the study flowchart.
Training in the intervention and fidelity
The Peer Navigators will receive induction and advanced
‘front loaded ’training in the first 3 months in their post
and will receive updates as appropriate throughout the
study. Training will be in areas related to the interven-
tion such as harm reduction, the relevance of a trauma
to substance use behaviour, professional boundaries and
therapeutic relationships, and PIEs. They will also re-
ceive training and induction to the study, including onTable 1 Sampling, recruitment and data collection strategy
Sample Recruitment strategy and timescale Data collection methods and proposed sample size
1. Participants
receiving the
interventionPeople who are homeless with problem substance use who
are engaged with the intervention
A sub-group of those in the intervention will be identified
by researchers as the process evaluation sample for qualita-
tive data collection.
Timescale: months 9 –11 and 16 –17As part of the holistic health check ( n= 60), standardised
measures of socio-demographic characteristics, housing sta-
tus/quality and general health status; quality of life (SF36);
substance use (SURE and MAP); mental health (GAD7 and
PHQ9); will be used, plus measures to assess relationship
quality (CARE). All participants will have this information col-
lected if they consent to the health checks and the data col-
lection component. The health checks will be conducted
twice, towards the start and near the end of the intervention,
by researchers.
Individual face-to-face interviews ( n=2 0 –25) conducted on
two occasions by Peer Researchers approximately 20 –40 min
in duration. Interviews will examine various elements of feasi-
bility and acceptability of intervention (except in Liverpool
where only one interview will be attempted due to short-
ened intervention).
2. Participants who
have dropped outPeople who are homeless with problem substance use who
initially engage but leave the intervention early, identified by
the Service Manager and invited to complete a short,
structured questionnaire.
Timescale: as soon as possible after ending engagement.All participants who drop out will be provided (via the
Service Manager where the Peer Navigator is based) with a
short questionnaire to voluntarily complete and return via a
sealed envelope. This will ask questions about their
experiences of working with the Peer Navigator and the
reasons underlying their decision to withdraw their
participation. This will not be shared with the Peer Navigator
but go directly to the study Chief Investigator.
3. Peer Navigators All four Peer Navigators employed for the duration of the
project (training/intervention development, mid-intervention
delivery and towards the end of the intervention period).Individual interviews ( n= 4) at three time points conducted
by researchers (approx. 60 –90 min). Interviews examine
recruitment, health checks and potential outcome measures,
training and support/supervision, fit to context, fidelity,
acceptability —topics informed by feasibility study literature
[73].
4. Service staff in
intervention and
standard care settingsSupport workers, team leaders, managers/other staff working
in the six intervention sites and two standard care settings.
Timescale: months 6 –12Interviews ( n= 16 across intervention/standard care sites),
conducted by researchers (approx. 60 min) examining issues
listed in box above, drawing on feasibility study literature on
areas of focus noted above [ 73].
5. Intervention/
standard care settingsSix intervention sites and two standard care sites will be
included
Timescale: months 6 –12Semi-structured, non-participant observations in all sites to
gain an understanding of the of the culture and context of
the settings, staffing levels, client group, activities provided,
and fit between intervention and setting in the intervention
sites.Parkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 9 of 15
recruitment and relevant ethical issues such as asses-
sing eligibility and informed consent. A training man-
ual will be produced and refined as part of the study.
Fidelity to the guide and core components of the
intervention will be assessed in the interviews with
Peer Navigators. It is important to formally acknow-
ledge that the study team understands that each Peer
Navigator will bring their own experiences and indi-
viduality to the intervention and to each of their rela-
tionships with participants and the feasibility design
allows a diversity of approach to be well explored and
reflected upon. Each Peer Navigator will receive regu-
lar one-to-one (face-to-face or phone) clinical supervi-
sion with a Clinical Psychologist with expertise in
working with the participant group and supporting
staff working with this group. The value of this super-
vision will be explored in the process evaluation.
Outcome measures via ‘holistic health checks ’
The following outcome measures will be administered as
two ‘holistic health checks ’, one in the first few months
of the intervention (November 2018 –May 2019) and one
near the end (August –October 2019)./C15Socio-demographic characteristics, housing status/
quality and general health status will be assessed and
cover demographics, education, housing, health
conditions, medication, health status and future
service use.
/C15Mental health will be measured using the
Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7), a 7-item
tool covering symptoms of anxiety [ 89], and the Pa-
tient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9), a 9-item tool
covering symptoms of depression [ 90].
/C15Substance use will be measured using the Maudsley
Addiction Profile (MAP), which has been slightly
amended to fit the current population (it will not be
scored). The 36-item tool covers substance use
(type/frequency/method), overdose, treatment,
injecting and sexual behaviour, physical and psycho-
logical health, social functioning, relationships and
illegal activities [ 91]; and the Substance Use Recov-
ery Evaluator (SURE), a 26-item tool covering drink-
ing and drug use, self-care, relationships, material
resources, outlook on life and importance of previ-
ous items [ 92].
/C15Health-related quality of life will be measured using
the Short-Form 36 (SF36), a 36-item tool covering
Fig. 2 SHARPS study flowchartParkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 10 of 15
physical and emotional health status, the effect of
health on daily activities and social activities and ex-
periences of pain [ 93].
/C15The quality of the relationship between the Peer
Navigator and the participant will be measured
using the CARE Patient Feedback Measure, a 10-
item tool assessing empathy in the context of rela-
tionship [ 94].
These holistic health checks will take place in a private
space with the researchers taking sufficient time to work
through each of the measures with each participant allow-
ing time for full discussion if needed. The measures will
be paper-based and conducted in a sensitive and relational
manner. The Peer Navigators will be available throughout
if the participant wishes to have their support.
Data analysis
Raw data and overall scores from each of the outcome
measures will be inputted from the paper-based mea-
sures into Statistical Package for the Social Science
(SPSS) and analysed using descriptive statistics to gain
an understanding of population characteristics in both
the intervention and standard care settings, as well as to
assess process issues in the collection of these data such
as missing/incomplete and poor quality data. Analysis
using descriptive statistics is appropriate in feasibility
studies [ 95].
The framework method [ 96] will be used for the man-
agement and analysis of all qualitative data (interview
transcripts and observational fieldnotes) because of its
ability to support the analysis of the eight different set-
tings (six intervention, two standard care) as cases and
because it allows within case and between case compari-
sons [ 96]. Framework involves five stages as follows: (1)
familiarisation, where the transcripts are read multiple
times; (2) identifying a thematic framework, whereby the
researchers recognise emerging themes in the dataset;
(3) indexing, which involves identifying data that corres-
pond to a theme; (4) charting, in which the specific
pieces of data are arranged in tables according to
themes; and (5) mapping and interpretation, involving
analysis of key characteristics in the tables and providing
an interpretation of the dataset [ 96]. The observational
data will be gathered in the form of semi-structured
fieldnotes using a pro-forma.
All qualitative data will be analysed with the support
of the computer software package NVivo. The staff in-
terviews from the settings will be analysed together and
will compare intervention/non-intervention differences.
The interviews from Peer Navigators will be analysed to-
gether with particular issues specifically noted, e.g. fidel-
ity to the intervention, challenges with recruitment and
drop out, fit between intervention and contexts. We willcollect data at different time points with both Peer Navi-
gators and participants, and data analysis will specifically
interrogate whether, and how, perceptions of the inter-
vention, its challenges and benefits, changed over time.
Data analysis will be iterative throughout phases 1 and
2, supported by the use of NPT [ 80] to identify context-
ual influences on the implementation of the intervention
across the different settings.
A sub-group of Peer Researchers will be invited to par-
ticipate in the data analysis and interpretation, supported
by the study team. They will be provided with an anon-
ymised selection of interview transcripts and asked to
provide their interpretations of the themes arising and
their significance (stages 1 –3). We will also involve the
Peer Researchers in stage 5 of the analysis, as a form of
‘member checking ’to enhance the validity and trust-
worthiness of the study findings [ 97].
The quantitative data from the outcome measures will
be combined with the qualitative data from the staff,
Peer Navigator and participant interviews and observa-
tional fieldnotes, using concurrent triangulation design
[98]. This design has a single-phase timing and generally
involves the concurrent, but separate, collection and
analysis of quantitative and qualitative data. Data sets
are merged, typically by bringing separate results to-
gether in the interpretation or by transforming data to
facilitate integrating the two data types during analysis.
The analysis will address all the research questions in-
cluding whether and how a future RCT should be con-
ducted to test effectiveness.
Trial registration
The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry. The
trial reference is ISRCTN15900054.
Discussion
This study will provide evidence regarding the feasibility
and acceptability of a peer-delivered harm reduction
intervention to people experiencing homelessness and
problem substance use. While there is considerable evi-
dence regarding harm reduction approaches more gener-
ally, the evidence is lacking for approaches that are both
acceptable to, and effective for, people who are homeless
who use both drugs and alcohol. There is also limited
evidence regarding peer support interventions with this
population. As above, relational and peer-led harm re-
duction approaches show much promise in engaging,
and then effectively working with, people with intersect-
ing housing, health and alcohol and drug use challenges
to reduce harms and enhance physical and mental health
and wellbeing, quality of life, social functioning and rela-
tionships. While there is evidence that both the rela-
tional ‘therapeutic alliance ’and the peer-led approach
can be powerful tools for this vulnerable population,Parkes et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:64 Page 11 of 15
more rigorous investigation is required as evidence to
date is based on small scale pilot studies.
This feasibility and acceptability study aims to address
this gap and inform a decision on whether or not to
proceed to a definitive trial. Success will be measured in
terms of recruitment and retention of participants, the
suitability of outcome measures and positive experiences
of participants, Peer Navigators and staff. A key consid-
eration in the design of a future RCT is the settings in
which the intervention is delivered. This feasibility and
acceptability study is being conducted in third sector set-
tings, covering both residential and outreach environ-
ments. In planning a future definitive RCT, decisions
will need to be made regarding whether any adaptations
are required to facilitate adoption in wider NHS, social
care statutory services and statutory homelessness ser-
vices. Furthermore, it would be necessary to determine
whether randomisation would be feasible and acceptable
for participants, staff and services in a future trial.
