Abstract 
Background A high proportion of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will at some point 
in their lives be assessed as not having the capacity to make their own decisions about pharmacological treat -
ment or inpatient care (‘capacity’). Few will be helped to regain it before these interventions proceed. This is partly 
because effective and safe methods to do so are lacking. Our aim is to accelerate their development by testing, 
for the first time in mental healthcare, the feasibility, acceptability and safety of running an ‘Umbrella’ trial. This involves 
running, concurrently and under one multi-site infrastructure, multiple assessor-blind randomised controlled trials, 
each of which is designed to examine the effect on capacity of improving a single psychological mechanism (‘mecha-
nism’). Our primary objectives are to demonstrate feasibility of (i) recruitment and (ii) data retention on the MacArthur 
Competence Assessment Tool-Treatment (MacCAT-T; planned primary outcome for a future trial) at end-of-treatment. 
We selected three mechanisms to test: ‘self-stigma’ , low self-esteem and the ‘jumping to conclusions’ bias. Each is highly 
prevalent in psychosis, responsive to psychological intervention, and hypothesised to contribute to impaired capacity.
Methods Sixty participants with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses, impaired capacity and one or more mechanism(s) 
will be recruited from outpatient and inpatient mental health services in three UK sites (Lothian, Scotland; Lancashire 
and Pennine; North West England). Those lacking capacity to consent to research could take part if the key criteria were 
met, including either proxy consent (Scotland) or favourable Consultee advice (England). They will be allocated to one 
of three randomised controlled trials, depending on which mechanism(s) they have. They will then be randomised

to receive, over an 8-week period and in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), 6 sessions of either a psychological 
intervention which targets the mechanism, or 6 sessions of assessment of the causes of their incapacity (control condi-
tion). Participants are assessed at 0 (baseline), 8 (end-of-treatment) and 24 (follow-up) weeks post-randomisation using 
measures of capacity (MacCAT-T), mechanism, adverse events, psychotic symptoms, subjective recovery, quality of life, 
service use, anxiety, core schemata and depression. Two nested qualitative studies will be conducted; one to under -
stand participant and clinician experiences and one to investigate the validity of MacCAT-T appreciation ratings.
Discussion This will be the first Umbrella trial in mental healthcare. It will produce the first 3 single-blind randomised 
controlled trials of psychological interventions to support treatment decision-making in schizophrenia-spectrum 
disorder. Demonstrating feasibility will have significant implications not only for those seeking to support capacity 
in psychosis, but also for those who wish to accelerate the development of psychological interventions for other 
conditions.

Background
Approximately 9–10 people per 1000 will be diagnosed 
with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (‘psychosis’) at 
some point in their lives [1 ]. Those affected may expe -
rience a range of distressing symptoms, from halluci -
nations, delusions and conceptual disorganisation to 
reduced motivation, anhedonia and cognitive impair -
ment. They have a much greater risk of dying by suicide 
relative to the general population [2 ] which, together 
with significantly poorer physical health, contributes to a 
reduction in their life expectancy of 14–15 years [3 ].
People with psychosis are also very likely to experi -
ence both ‘external’ threats to their autonomy, in the 
form of involuntary psychiatric treatment, and ‘inter -
nal’ threats, arising from the effects of psychotic symp -
toms on their ability to make decisions [4, 5]. In turn, 
clinicians must balance their duty to provide them with 
effective care and treatment with their duty to promote 
their autonomy. Although traditional treatments for 
psychosis may have beneficial effects on autonomy over 
the medium to longer-term [6], these must be weighed 
against the immediate loss of autonomy that occurs if 
they are administered under compulsion, particularly if 
they interfere with one’s bodily integrity, liberty or right 
to a private life [7, 8]. In many jurisdictions, it is therefore 
necessary—but not sufficient—to first demonstrate that a 
person lacks the ability or ‘mental capacity’ to make deci -
sions about that treatment, before it can proceed without 
their consent [9, 10].
Definitions of mental capacity vary; however, most 
involve the ability to understand decision-relevant infor -
mation and the ability to communicate one’s decision. 
Many also involve the abilities to retain, use and weigh 
relevant information and/or appreciate it [11]. When the 
capacity to make treatment decisions is lost (hereafter ‘capacity’), there is a long-standing ethical, legal and 
human-rights based imperative for clinicians to support 
its return [12–15]. In practice, however, such support is 
rare [16, 17].
There is increasing pressure for this to change. The 
United Nations Committee on the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), the 
National Institute of Clinical and Care Excellence (NICE) 
and the recent Wessely and Scott Reviews of UK mental 
health legislation have all emphasised the fundamental 
importance of supporting treatment decision-making 
to protect a person’s autonomy [18–21]. Despite these 
developments, there is a lack of evidence—across health -
care—on how to do this effectively [19].
For people with psychosis, our recent systematic review 
confirmed there are no evidence-based interventions to 
restore their ability to make their own treatment decisions 
[5]. We have conducted a number of studies to address 
this [4 , 22–29] which, taken together, suggest a lack of 
capacity in this group may stem from specific cognitive, 
emotional and social factors, the independent and inter -
acting effects of which are moderated by awareness of 
them. We specifically predict that avoiding exposure to 
self-stigmatising beliefs about illness may motivate a per -
son to reject the possibility they have any need for care, 
that low self-esteem may fuel distrust and treatment-
related paranoia and that individuals with a ‘jumping to 
conclusions’ bias may struggle to gather sufficient infor -
mation about treatment before accepting or rejecting it. 
How these factors interact in those lacking capacity is not 
yet known, but it is plausible to suggest, for instance, that 
low self-esteem and high self-stigma may reinforce each 
other [30, 31] or that a person with low self-esteem and 
the JTC bias may be particularly vulnerable to developing 
self-stigma.

Self-stigma, low self-esteem and the jumping to con -
clusions bias are each highly prevalent in psychosis [24, 
29, 32], and psychological interventions that selectively 
reduce them already exist [22, 33–38]. This means we 
can conduct ‘interventionist-causal RCTs’ (IC-RCTs) to 
examine whether they also improve capacity [39, 40]. 
Participants in an IC-RCT are selected to ensure they 
have both the condition (e.g., impaired capacity) and 
the hypothesised cause of the condition (e.g., jumping 
to conclusions bias), before being randomly allocated to 
either a control condition or an intervention designed 
to reduce the potential cause [40]. Positive results mean 
both a cause and a treatment component have been iden -
tified, whereas null results are informative insofar as they 
allow model refinement.
However, because complex conditions have multi -
ple causes, multiple IC-RCTs are required to develop 
a comprehensive intervention, which can be expensive 
and delay treatment development. One solution is to run 
several of these trials at the same time within one over -
all infrastructure, with each focused on a different cause. 
This removes duplication of time and effort in relation 
to protocol development, ethical approval, advertising, 
recruitment, management, staff training, so on, there -
fore greatly increasing efficiency. Indeed, we estimate 
that this approach, which is also known as an ‘Umbrella 
trial’ , could produce an effective intervention in half the 
time, for half the cost. However, although they have been 
highly successful in improving treatments for cancer and 
other physical health problems [41, 42], Umbrella trials 
have never before been used to develop a psychologi -
cal or pharmacological intervention for a mental health 
problem [42, 43].
Our aim is therefore to conduct the first Umbrella trial 
in mental healthcare, using this to accelerate the develop -
ment of the first evidence-based intervention to support 
capacity in psychosis. The DEC:IDES (‘DEcision-making 
Capacity: Intervention Development and Evaluation in 
Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders’) trial involves run -
ning three IC-RCTs in parallel, each testing the effect on 
capacity of an intervention to either reduce self-stigma, 
improve self-esteem or reduce the jumping to conclu -
sions bias. Our aims at this stage are restricted to demon -
strating feasibility, acceptability and safety. Our primary 
objectives are to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment 
and determine data quality and completion rates for the 
MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment 
(MacCAT-T) [44], a widely used measure of treatment 
decision-making capacity and our planned primary out -
come in a future trial. Our secondary objectives include 
assessing adverse events, data completion rates for sec -
ondary efficacy and mechanism outcomes, participant and clinician acceptability of the trial, and the construct 
validity of the MacCAT-T.
Methods
Design
DEC:IDES is a multi-site single (rater) blind Umbrella 
trial of psychological interventions to support treat -
ment decision-making capacity in people diagnosed 
with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Participants are 
randomly allocated to receive treatment as usual (TAU) 
plus a psychological intervention to improve either (i) 
self-stigma, (ii) self-esteem or (iii) the jumping to con -
clusions (JTC) reasoning bias, or TAU plus an attention 
control condition (see Fig.  1). Each intervention group 
is compared to its own control group (each receive the 
same standardised procedure) to ensure participants in 
each trial are equivalent with respect to their present -
ing mechanism. This means the study consists of three 
2-arm IC-RCTs (treatment vs. control) running in paral -
lel under one overall infrastructure, or ‘Umbrella’ . TAU is 
measured, but not changed.
We provide control participants with a ‘non-specific’ 
attention control condition (in addition to TAU) because 
we need to demonstrate acceptability before using it in a 
larger trial. An appropriate attention-control reduces the 
risk of a false-positive finding favouring intervention effi -
cacy (i.e., it increases confidence that group differences 
reflect specific causal effects of the intervention). Our 
control condition involves a therapist completing further 
assessment of factors which help or hinder a participant’s 
capacity and is carefully matched for time and attention 
to the interventions.
Assessments are carried out at 0 (baseline), 8 (end-
of-treatment; EoT) and 24  weeks (follow-up; FU) by a 
researcher masked to treatment allocation. Due to lim -
ited resources and because our intention at this stage is 
simply to demonstrate the feasibility of retaining partic -
ipants for follow-up, only those randomised in the first 
5 (England) to 23 (Scotland) months are eligible for the 
24-week assessment.1 We have multiple sites (1 in Scot -
land; 2 in England) primarily to examine the feasibility 
of multi-site procedures. To minimise cost, we made an 
a priori decision to recruit 75% of participants from the 
lead site, NHS Lothian.
There are two nested qualitative studies; one uses 
framework analysis [45] to document and understand 
participant and clinician experiences of the trial (‘ Qualita -
tive study 1’), and another uses case study methodology 
1 The number of participants eligible for follow-up increased when the 
recruitment window was increased to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. See CONSERVE checklist.

[46, 47] to investigate the validity of improvements in 
MacCAT-T appreciation ratings (‘ Qualitative study 2’). 
Both these studies are conducted after participants have 
completed their final research assessment.
DEC:IDES was approved by two NHS Research Eth -
ics Committees (RECs) representing Scotland (IRAS 
ID: 263575) and England (IRAS ID: 265638). The NHS 
Health Research Authority required separate approval 
from both Scotland and England because of differences in 
legal regimes governing the inclusion of adults who lack 
capacity to consent to research. DEC:IDES was pre-regis -
tered on 16 March 2020, prior to first randomisation,
(NCT04309435; https:// clini caltr  ials. gov/ ct2/ show/ NCT04  
309435).2
Informed consent is acquired from all participants with 
intact decision-making capacity to consent to research, 
using an approved consent form.3 Special REC approval was obtained to include participants who lacked capacity 
to consent to participate, based on the study and its pro -
cedures meeting criteria specified in the Mental Capacity 
(England & Wales) Act (2005) and Adults with Incapacity 
(Scotland) Act (2001) [48, 49].
A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) provides oversight 
of the trial and incorporates the functions of a Data Mon -
itoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC). Membership 
includes service-user and carer representatives, research -
ers and clinicians. The TSC reviews all SAEs as they 
occur and can recommend to the Sponsor and NHS REC 
that the trial be terminated for reasons of safety.
A schedule of enrolment, interventions and assess -
ments is provided in Table  1. See Additional file  1 for 
a combined checklist incorporating the ‘Standard Pro -
tocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Tri -
als’ (SPIRIT) checklist and the CONSERVE extension

Participants
We calculated that 60 participants (20 per trial) would 
allow us to estimate a data non-retention rate of 15%, at 
week 8, to within a 95% confidence interval of ± 9%.
Individuals can participate in DEC:IDES if they are as 
follows:
• Diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder 
(schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional 
disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, brief 
psychotic disorder)
• Aged 18–65
• Able to be interviewed and complete the measures
• Registered as a patient with clinical or social care 
services
• Judged to lack capacity to make treatment deci -
sions by their referring clinician and the researcher 
(using the MacCAT-T)
• Have either (i) low self-esteem, defined as a score 
of < 15 on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) 
[53]; (ii) high self-stigma, defined as a score of ≥ 60 
on Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory 
(ISMI) [54]; and/or (iii) a JTC bias, defined as select -
ing ≤ 2 beads on the Beads Task [29, 55].Individuals are unable to participate if they are as 
follows:
• Have a moderate to severe learning disability
• Have psychosis of a predominantly organic origin 
(e.g. brain injury, physical health condition, epilepsy) 
or a primary diagnosis of substance or alcohol use 
disorder
• Cannot understand English sufficiently to engage in 
conversation without an interpreter
• Present with a level of risk to others that cannot be 
managed via suitable adjustments.
Research assistants (RAs) seek referrals from clini -
cians in inpatient and outpatient clinical services in NHS 
Lothian, Lancashire & South Cumbria NHS Foundation 
Trust and Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust. We also 
accept self-referral, but only if the participant agrees to 
us contacting their mental health provider for risk assess -
ment purposes. Posters are placed in inpatient wards and 
outpatient clinics to advertise the study to participants. 
These provide the study website address, which hosts 
information sheets and the consent form. Adverts were 
also placed in newspapers and bus stop shelters in the 
NHS Lothian area (see Fig.  2). Interested participants are 
provided with an information sheet, and any initial ques -
tions are answered. They are then recontacted by an RA 
a minimum of 48  h later. Those eligible and consenting Table 1 Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments (SPIRIT 2013 guidelines)

then enter the trial. To compensate them for their time, 
participants received a £10 supermarket voucher after 
the baseline assessment, and again after the end-of-treat -
ment and follow-up assessments (£30 in total). Reasons 
for exclusion will be reported as per the CONSORT 2010 
guidelines [56] and the 2016 extension for feasibility and 
pilot trials [50]. Figure  3 provides the CONSORT par -
ticipant flow diagram template, designed to provide more 
detailed information on recruitment flow.
Qualitative study 1
We aim to recruit 6 patients and 6 staff members from 
the Lothian site for this study, via a mixture of purpo -
sive and random sampling. We try to ensure there is 
one patient from every arm of the study, that half are 
from an inpatient setting and that one third are self-
referrers. A similar process is applied to selecting the 
staff sample. When we have multiple patients or staff to 
choose from, we use an online randomisation website 
(https:// www. random. org/ lists/) to determine order of 
invitation.
Qualitative study 2
We aim to recruit up to 10 patients from the Lothian site 
for this study. Participants are eligible if they have com -
pleted the main study in the preceding 6 months and if 
their scores for appreciation on the MacCAT-T have 
improved by at least 1 point between assessments. If 
there are more than 10 eligible participants, the order of 
invitation will again be determined randomly.Randomisation and blinding
There are two points of randomisation: randomisation 
to trial (‘R1’) and randomisation to treatment or control 
(‘R2’). R1 is used to allocate individuals when they are eligi -
ble for two or more trials. Randomisation is conducted by 
the automated and online service provided by Sealed Enve -
lope (https:// www. seale  denve  lope. com/) using concealed 
and randomly generated allocation sequences (without 
stratification or random permuted blocks) per each pos -
sible combination of trials, with 1:1 or 1:1:1 ratios.4 This 
sequence was generated and stored online by Sealed Enve -
lope and was inaccessible to the research team.
R2 is also performed by Sealed Envelope, using a single 
concealed and randomly generated allocation sequence 
(1:1 ratio), stratified by trial and using random per -
muted blocks of 2 and 4. There was no stratification by 
therapist or site. PJT used Sealed Envelope to generate 
this sequence, which was inaccessible to the rest of the 
research team. PJT was masked to participant alloca -
tion and played no role in their enrolment or assess -
ment. In order to minimise non-ignorable missing data,

4 On 2 September 2022, an amendment was approved to allow preferen-
tial allocation to the self-esteem trial. This was introduced to mitigate the 
negative effect on recruitment of an unexpectedly low prevalence of low 
self-esteem in this population. It means that if a participant is eligible for 
the self-esteem trial, they are non-randomly allocated to it regardless of 
whether they are also eligible for the self-stigma and/or JTC trials. Partici-
pants who are eligible only for the latter two trials continue to be randomly 
allocated to one of them.

 Hutton et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:117 
 
R2 is performed as late as possible, which is normally 
the beginning of the participant’s first meeting with their 
therapist.5 The result of R2 is communicated by email 
to the Chief Investigator, who informs the therapist by 
phone, who in turn informs the participant.
Outcome assessors are masked to the result of R2 but 
not R1 (no comparisons between trials are planned). 
Masking is maintained by (i) assessors and therapists 
having separate offices, phone numbers and filing sys -
tems; (ii) assessors reminding participants at the start 
of any phone calls or in-person meetings to not disclose 
their allocation; and (iii) assessors not examining clinical 
notes after R2 are performed. Assessors and therapists 
also refrain from discussing participants after R2, unless 
required to manage risk. If an unmasking occurs, this 
and its cause are recorded, and a new masked assessor completes any subsequent assessments. Deliberate 
unmasking was only allowed if doing so was judged by 
the CI and PI to be required to prevent harm occurring 
to the participant, a researcher or a third party.
Assessments
Table  2 provides specific information on the purpose and 
timing of all measurements and outcomes.
Sample characteristics
To characterise the sample and confirm eligibility, base -
line information on demographics, legal status, offend -
ing history, medication regime stability, level of service 
engagement, alcohol/drug use measured using questions 
from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [57] 
and the Drug Abuse Screening Test [58] and other treat -
ments are gathered via interview with the participant, 
consultation with their referrer and/or treatment pro -
vider and review of clinical records. Additional meas -
ures administered only at baseline include the Clinical 
Interview for Psychotic Disorders (CIPD; to confirm and Fig. 3 CONSORT diagram template
5 On 28 November 2022, an amendment was submitted to allow R2 to pro-
ceed prior to session 1 if the randomisation administrator was unavailable at 
the time of session 1 (e.g. due to leave or illness).

record diagnosis) [59], the Brief Neurocognitive Assess -
ment (BNA; to measure baseline cognitive functioning) 
[60] and the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness ques -
tionnaire (ISMI; to determine eligibility for self-stigma 
trial) [54].6
Primary outcomes
We made an a priori decision to seek to progress to 
a definitive trial if we (1) achieved our target recruit -
ment figure (n = 60) over the recruitment window and 
(2) acquired end-of-treatment (8  weeks) MacCAT-T 
data from ≥ 75% of those randomised. The MacCAT-T 
assesses participants on 4 domains of treatment decision-
making capacity: (i) ‘understanding’ , scored 0–6 (3 items); 
(ii) ‘reasoning’ , scored 0–8 (4 items); (iii) ‘appreciation’ , 
scored 0–4 (2 items); and (iv) ‘expressing a choice’ , scored 
0–2 (1 item) [61]. Higher scores indicate greater ability 
in each domain. We define data completion as the num -
ber of participants completing a MacCAT-T assessment 
at week 8 divided by the number of participants ran -
domised to treatment or control.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes relate to data completion rates on 
the MacCAT-T at follow-up and planned secondary 
outcome measures at end-of-treatment and follow-up. 
We measure psychotic symptoms with the Positive And 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [62], subjective recov -
ery with the Questionnaire on the Process of Recovery 
(QPR) [63], quality of life with the Schizophrenia Quality 
of Life scale (SQoL) [64], service use with the Client Ser -
vice Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [65], anxiety with the Beck 
Anxiety Inventory [66], core schemata with the Brief 
Core Schema Scale (BCSS) [67] and depression with the 
Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) [68]. 
To assess feasibility of measuring psychological mecha -
nisms (i.e., mediators of efficacy), we assess self-esteem 
with the RSES [53], data-gathering with the Beads Task 
(85:15 version) [55] and self-stigma with the Structured 
Interview Measure of Stigma (SIMS) [69].
Adverse events
We administer a range of other measures to detect any 
evidence of harm or threats to acceptability, following an 
adapted version of a previously used protocol [70, 71]. 
We record serious adverse events (SAEs; suicidal crisis, 
suicide attempts, suicide, death for reasons other than 
suicide, symptom exacerbation, readmission, other medi -
cally important events) and mild to moderate events (e.g., temporarily heightened distress). We define suicidal crisis 
without attempt as a score of 2 on item 8 of the CDSS. 
Severe symptom exacerbation is defined as a rating of ≥ 6 
on a patient or researcher-rated Clinical Global Impres -
sion Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression 
Improvement (CGI-I) scales [72, 73]. Both the patient 
and researcher-rated CGI-S are scored from 1 to 7, with 
higher scores indicating greater symptom severity; the 
CGI-I scales are also scored from 1 to 7, with higher 
scores indicating less improvement. Masked assessors 
administer the suicidality measure (item 8 of CDSS) at 
0, 8 and 24 weeks, and the symptom exacerbation meas -
ures (patient and researcher rated CGI-I and CGI-S) at 8 
and 24 weeks only. Non-masked therapists also complete 
these measures at the start of every intervention or con -
trol session. To assess mild to moderate adverse events, 
the number of participants stating they agree ‘quite a lot’ 
or ‘very much’ (corresponding to a score of 3 or 4, respec -
tively) with each item on a self-report measure of adverse 
events (the Adverse Experiences in Psychotherapy ques -
tionnaire; AEP)7 at weeks 8 and 24 is recorded. Partici -
pants who leave the study early are invited to complete a 
parallel version of the AEP , designed to assess whether an 
adverse event led to their early discontinuation.
MacCAT -T construct validity
As part of the assessment of the MacCAT-T construct 
validity, the Schedule for Assessment of Insight (SAI)8 
[74] is administered with patients, while their referrers 
or treatment providers are asked to complete a version 
of the Clinical Global Impression scale modified to assess 
(in) capacity (CGI–Capacity). Both are administered at 0, 
8 and 24 weeks.
Intervention and control procedures
Table  3 details the shared and specific components of the 
clinical procedures, each of which last 6 h and are deliv -
ered over an 8-week window. The default model of deliv -
ery is weekly 1-h sessions; however, this can be adjusted 
(e.g. shorter and more frequent sessions can be pro -
vided). The therapy window is deliberately short because 
we anticipate services and/or clinicians would be unwill -
ing or unable to wait too long for a person to regain 
capacity before proceeding with treatment. Sessions will 
be recorded for supervision and a random sample will be 
assessed for adherence and competence.
Each intervention and the control condition are deliv -
ered by the same therapists, according to structured and

however, an error led to the original version being used instead.

manualised protocols. Therapists were either clinical psy -
chologists who had trained in cognitive behavioural ther -
apy (CBT), or CBT therapists accredited by the British 
Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychothera -
pies. Initial and ongoing training on the clinical protocols 
are provided by the Chief Investigator (CI) in conjunc -
tion with local site Principal Investigators (PIs), who also 
provide therapists with regular individual supervision. 
To refine the clinical procedures, therapists are asked 
to keep a written diary to record what they perceived 
to be the positive and challenging aspects of interven -
tion delivery. Clinical procedures were discontinued if a 
participant experienced an SAE which the CI and/or an 
independent clinical member of the TSC judged to be 
caused by those procedures and discontinuation would 
not cause them further harm.
All clinical procedures involve non-specific therapeutic 
elements of engagement, listening, positive regard, empa -
thy and collaboration. They are all structured, agenda-
driven and manualised, and all involve between-session 
activity for the participant (i.e., ‘homework’). In the inter -
ventions, the between-session activity is focused on 
understanding and/or resolving the target psychological 
mechanism (whether low self-esteem, self-stigma or the 
JTC bias), whereas in the control condition it is focused 
on gathering additional information to enable further 
assessment of factors which may affect their capacity 
(e.g., completion of questionnaires or completing a life 
event timeline). The interventions follow the principles of 
cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) [75]. However, unlike traditional CBTp where therapy goals 
are often decided in collaboration with the patient, the 
interventions here are focused on a specific mechanism 
and the specific outcome of improving capacity, although 
effort is made to relate this to the personal goals of the 
participant.
The content of the self-stigma intervention is focused 
on negative beliefs about schizophrenia, psychosis and 
psychotic symptoms, and their potential effect on treat -
ment decision-making. Building on previous work [33], 
it involves provision of normalising and destigmatising 
information, or completion of behavioural experiments 
and anti-stigma data logs focused on challenging stigma-
related beliefs, or building and strengthening alternative 
non-stigmatising ones. Building on the work of others 
[36], the self-esteem intervention is focused on beliefs 
about the self and their potential relationship to decision-
making about treatment. Only it involves strengthen -
ing positive-self beliefs and weakening negative-self ones 
via the use of a positive data log or activity planning, for 
example. The JTC intervention is focused on the JTC bias. 
Adapted from a version developed for an earlier trial [22], 
which was in turn a distilled version of a module taken 
from Metacognitive Training (MCT) [76], it involves 
explaining this bias to participants, raising awareness of 
its potential effects on treatment decision-making, and 
encouragement of greater evidence-gathering.
The aim of the control condition is simply to gather 
more information on factors which may help or hinder 
the participant’s treatment decision-making. It includes Table 3 Details of interventions and control procedures

administration of additional psychometric measures, 
interviews and/or questionnaires. The therapist merely 
assesses; they do not provide feedback, try to increase 
understanding, or conduct formulation. However, once 
a participant completes the trial, the therapist recontacts 
them and their clinician (if the participant consents), to 
offer a psychological formulation focused on understand -
ing their impaired decision-making, with recommenda -
tions to support it. We tested the acceptability and safety 
of this overall approach in a previous case series [25].
Treatment as usual (TAU)
TAU for inpatients with psychosis in the UK typically 
involves regular assessment and care from NHS psychia -
trists, nurses and other professionals. Pharmacological 
treatment with antipsychotic medication is nearly always 
offered [77]. This is administered either orally and/or 
via injection and in many cases involuntarily. Cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) is offered to approximately 
half of inpatients [77], in addition to other psychosocial 
interventions such as art therapy or occupational therapy. 
TAU for outpatients with psychosis typically involves 
assessment and care from a community mental health 
team (CMHT). These involve a range of profession -
als, including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical 
psychologists and occupational therapists. Patients are 
usually prescribed antipsychotic medication and approxi -
mately one quarter are offered CBT [77]. In England, but 
not Scotland, all people experiencing their first episode 
psychosis are required to be offered rapid intervention 
and support from specialist Early Intervention in Psycho -
sis services. Both England and Scotland allow for the use 
of Community Treatment Orders, whereby outpatients 
are required to adhere to pharmacological treatments or 
be readmitted to hospital. Focused psychological support 
for treatment decision-making capacity is likely to be rare 
at best, regardless of setting.
Although TAU may—and indeed ought to—have ben -
eficial effects on the outcomes targeted by DEC:IDES, 
randomisation should ensure these are evenly distrib -
uted across the treatment and control groups. Service 
usage will be measured at baseline, EoT and FU and any 
between-group differences will be noted.
Analysis
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP; see Additional file  1) has 
been prepared by PJT prior to data entry, in conjunction 
with PH, RE and ND.
Characterising the sample
All baseline data will be reported for the sample as a 
whole and per arm of each trial. All quantitative par -
ticipant baseline characteristics will be summarised by numbers and percentages, mean and standard devia -
tion (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR), as 
appropriate.
Primary outcomes
Data completion rates at 8  weeks post-randomisation 
(end of treatment) on the MacCAT-T will be presented 
as a percentage with 95% CIs, for the overall study, per 
trial and per arm of each trial. Proportion of the recruit -
ment target actually recruited will be reported as a per -
centage with 95% CIs. We will also report standardised 
and unstandardised effect sizes for group differences 
within each trial on the MacCAT-T at 8 weeks, with 95% 
CIs. Due to very limited power, these will not be subject 
to any efficacy-related interpretation. Effect sizes will be 
reported for both the (i) ‘as randomised’ (intention-to-
treat; ITT) sample and (ii) those randomised who also 
received ≥ 3 h of their allocated clinical procedures—i.e., 
a ‘per-protocol’ population.
Secondary outcomes
Data completion rates for all planned secondary efficacy 
and mechanism outcomes will be presented as a percent -
age with 95% CIs, for the overall study, per trial and per 
arm of each trial. Effect sizes and 95% CIs for each effi -
cacy and mechanism outcome will be reported, for both 
the ITT and per-protocol samples. We will also report 
the number of blind breaks.
Adverse events
For each treatment and control group, we will report 
number of (i) deaths by suicide, (ii) deaths not caused by 
suicide, (iii) participants attempting suicide, (iv) partici -
pants with suicidal crises, (v) participants experiencing 
severe symptom exacerbation and (vi) participants stat -
ing they agree ‘quite a lot’ or ‘very much’ (corresponding 
to a score of 3 or 4, respectively) with each item on the 
AEP . We will also report any other medically important 
SAEs. Whether any SAEs were judged by an independent 
clinical expert, Sponsor and/or NHS REC to be causally 
related to research and/or clinical procedures will also be 
reported.9
Qualitative study analyses
For qualitative study 1, framework analysis will be 
applied to interview recordings in line with the approach 
outlined by Gale (2013) [45]. This involves transcription, 
familiarisation and coding; development and application 
9 We will also report which events were identified via research assistants 
who were blind to treatment arm allocation (assessed at weeks 0, 8 and 24) 
and which events were identified via clinicians who were not blind to alloca-
tion (assessed at start of each clinical session).
Page 12 of 17 Hutton et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:117 
of a wider analytical framework; and charting data into 
the framework matrix and interpretation. We will use 
case study methodology for qualitative study 2. Analysis 
of interviews and research data will be structured using 
Yin’s (2014) overall ‘explanation building’ framework [47]. 
The steps involve making an initial explanatory proposi -
tion and comparing the findings of an initial case against 
this proposition. This is then revised, and other details of 
the case and any additional cases are compared against 
the revision. This process is repeated as many times as 
needed.
MacCAT -T validation
We will calculate and report the correlation between 
(i) MacCAT-T appreciation ratings and SAI ratings and 
(ii) MacCAT-T total scores and clinician CGI ratings of 
capacity, both with 95% CIs.
Service user and carer involvement
Service users and carers were involved at a number of 
stages in the project. We held a knowledge exchange 
event where we sought their views on the value of our 
intended research programme, and several service users 
reviewed the design and content of our participant infor -
mation sheets. Two service users also joined our Trial 
Steering Committee and provided oversight and guid -
ance on project completion.
Changes to protocol
Several changes were made to the study protocol at 
different phases of the project and received ethical 
approval where required. Their timing and purpose 
is outlined in Table  4. All the changes that occurred 
between the study being publicly registered and the first 
randomisation involved mitigation of pandemic-related 
health risks to participants and staff. The majority of 
the changes that occurred after the first randomisation 
involved mitigation of the effects of the pandemic on 
recruitment, with the main ones being the extension 
of the recruitment period in the Lothian site, increas -
ing the numbers allowed to take part in the individual 
trials and allowing previous trial completers to return 
to take part in one of the other trials, if eligible. Prefer -
ential allocation to the self-esteem trial was introduced 
primarily to mitigate the much lower than expected 
prevalence of low self-esteem in this population, a find -
ing which will be discussed further when we report our 
results.
Discussion
A high proportion of inpatients diagnosed with schizo -
phrenia-spectrum disorders are assessed as not being 
able to make their own decisions about their psychiatric treatment [78– 80]. Few, however, receive support to 
regain it [4 , 16, 17, 19]. Although various authorities 
have provided generic suggestions for ways to support 
capacity, such as simplification and repetition of infor -
mation, the reduction of anxiety or sedation, delaying 
the decision, or speech and language therapy [14, 15, 
19–21], such strategies are unlikely to be sufficient for 
people with complex or severe conditions such as psy -
chosis. Regardless, even these strategies are rarely imple -
mented [16].
The recent Wessely and Scott reviews [20, 21] both 
recommend using the well-established approaches of 
advocacy and advance statements10 to support people 
to make decisions about their psychiatric treatment. 
However, while evidence suggests these approaches 
may be important for supporting people to communi -
cate and implement these decisions [81– 85], particu -
larly in the context of power asymmetries between 
patients and clinicians, they make no claim to identify 
and/or mitigate threats to the internal, psychologi -
cal processes from which those decisions emerge [85, 
86]. While these approaches may support the exercise 
of legal capacity, they do not seek to rectify impaired 
mental capacity.
The aim of DEC:IDES is to begin the much-needed 
process of developing approaches that try to directly 
restore capacity for people diagnosed with schizophre -
nia-spectrum disorder. To say that there is much work 
to do is an understatement. The Code of Practice for 
the Adults with Incapacity Act (Scotland) (2000), states 
‘Every possible assistance must be given to the adult to 
understand his or her own medical condition and the 
decision that is required in relation to treatment. ’ and 
‘There is an absolute obligation to facilitate the exercise 
of capacity, where possible. ’ [15]. In England and Wales, 
the corresponding Code of Practice for the Mental 
Capacity Act (2005) states ‘ All practical and appropriate 
steps must be taken to help people to make a decision 
for themselves. ’ [14]. In the two decades since the laws 
underpinning these directives were passed, there have 
been no notable advances in what counts as ‘possible’ for 
people with psychosis, and no new ‘practical and appro -
priate steps’ have been developed [5 , 19].
We need to make up for this lost time. People with psy -
chosis cannot wait another 10–20 years for the emergence 
of effective and safe interventions to support their treat -
ment decision-making. Ambitious new methodologies 
are needed to accelerate the intervention-development 
10 The Wessely and Scott reviews use the terms ‘ Advance Choice Docu-
ments’ and ‘ Advance Choice’ , respectively.

process. Demonstrating the feasibility of DEC:IDES will 
have significant implications not only for those seeking 
to support capacity in psychosis, but also those who wish 
to accelerate the development of interventions for other 
conditions.
DEC:IDES compares interventions to an attention con -
trol, rather than usual care alone. Some consider usual 
care alone to be a better comparator because it best rep -
resents a problem’s natural course; however, we con -
sider this to be moot given the confounding effects of regression to the mean.11 More importantly, if we are to 
make evidence-based justifications for the time and cost 
involved in training people to deliver a complex interven -
tion, then demonstrating superiority to a non-specific 
control is required at some stage in the developmental Table 4 Timing and purpose of changes to protocol

not follow an inevitably deteriorating course, (b) the baseline assessment of 
problem severity takes place because the problem meets a specified thresh-
old of severity and (c) the post-treatment assessment takes place because a 
fixed time-point has been reached.

‘pipeline’ . Not introducing this early either unnecessar -
ily extends the length and expense of this pipeline or, if 
introduced later, increases uncertainty over both feasibil -
ity and efficacy after significant investment has already 
been made. Although early use of a non-specific control 
might increase the risk of type II error in relation to the 
non-specific benefits of a complex intervention, we do not 
think confirming that these exist is worth the investment.
DEC:IDES has a number of other key features. We have 
planned a detailed assessment of adverse events, thus 
allowing any early signs of harm to be detected. Asses -
sor-blinding will allow us to quantify the potential risk 
of blind-breaks in a larger trial. Finally, involvement of 
multiple sites helps us identify and resolve challenges to 
working across the different legal jurisdictions of Eng -
land and Scotland. Demonstrating that we can deliver a 
multi-site trial at this stage will be essential for assessing 
the feasibility of a larger trial, where multiple sites will be 
essential.
The main limitation of DEC:IDES is that we did not 
design it to be adaptive. That is, we did not build in a pri -
ori interim analyses of feasibility together with the flex -
ibility to drop, extend or replace trials. We anticipated 
this to be too challenging to navigate at this early stage, 
particularly given existing funding structures. However, 
if DEC:IDES is successful, then demonstrating adaptiv -
ity will be a key future objective. Another limitation is 
that our pre-specified progression criteria were lacking in 
detail. Although we clearly stated we would seek to pro -
ceed to a definitive trial if we met our recruitment and 
data retention objectives, we failed to specify the con -
sequences of not doing so. Unlike other feasibility trials 
[87], we did not outline in advance the circumstances 
under which we would continue the research programme 
with modifications, or simply discontinue it. It is impor -
tant to note that DEC:IDES was conducted almost 
entirely during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Draw -
ing inferences from trials conducted during this period 
is going to be challenging, but if DEC:IDES is feasible in 
this unusually adverse context, then it is likely to be fea -
sible in others. Finally, we did not formally assess align -
ment between patient and intervention goals. Although 
we hope our qualitative interviews will shed light on 
whether any such misalignment is a threat to accept -
ability, a future trial might consider assessing this more 
systematically—not least because ambivalence about 
support for treatment decision-making is reasonable to 
expect in this group.
DEC:IDES was initially funded for 19  months. Staff  
were appointed in December 2019, and recruitment 
commenced in late February 2020, before being paused 
almost immediately due to the pandemic. A major 
rebudgeting and reallocation of resources was agreed with the funder which, together with a small amount 
of additional funding, enabled the overall duration to 
increase to 34  months. Recruitment recommenced in 
October 2020, but with reduced research staff and signif -
icant pandemic-related constraints, including no access 
to psychiatric inpatient wards and no face-to-face con -
tact with community participants. Recruitment closed in 
October 2022. The final post-treatment assessments will 
be completed on 31 March 2023. Study results will be 
published shortly after. If DEC:IDES achieve its feasibil -
ity goals, we anticipate that the next step will be a defini -
tive Umbrella trial, with a sample size sufficient to make 
inferences about efficacy.
