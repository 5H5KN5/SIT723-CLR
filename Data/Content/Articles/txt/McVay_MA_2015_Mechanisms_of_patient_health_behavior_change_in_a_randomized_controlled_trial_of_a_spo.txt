Spouse-assisted interventions can improve health behaviors, but mechanisms of
action are unknown. This study evaluated mediators of dietary and physical activityoutcomes during a spouse-assisted intervention to improve low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol. This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial
comparing usual care ( n= 128) to a spouse-assisted lifestyle change intervention
(n= 127) comprising nine monthly goal setting telephone calls to participants and
support planning calls to spouses over 11 months. Structural equation modeling was
used to examine if the intervention in ﬂuenced the putative mediators of participant
self-ef ﬁcacy and perceived spousal support at 6 months (i.e. action test); if changes
in putative mediators at 6 months were associated with changes in diet and physical
activity outcomes at 11 months (i.e. conceptual test); and if treatment condition
effects on outcomes at 11 months were mediated by its effects on the 6-month puta-tive mediators (i.e. indirect effects test). Participants were 94.9% male, 64.9% whiteand were 61.3 years old on average. The action test showed that the intervention
increased dietary self-ef ﬁcacy ( p< .001) and perceived spousal support for diet
(p< .001) and physical activity ( p< .01) at 6 months. The conceptual test showed
that increases in participant physical activity self-ef ﬁcacy at 6 months were associ-
ated with increases in physical activity frequency ( p= .01) and duration ( p= .04) at
11 months; other putative mediators were not associated with changes in outcomes at11 months. The indirect effects tests did not support a mediating role for self-ef ﬁcacy
or perceived spousal support. Intervention-induced changes in spousal support and
dietary self-ef ﬁcacy did not translate into behavior change. Other mechanisms may
be driving behavior change.

Introduction
Spouses have highly concordant health behaviors (Di Castelnuovo, Quacquaruccio,
Donati, de Gaetano, & Iacoviello, 2009 ; Macken, Yates, & Blancher, 2000 ), and spousal
support has been linked to engagement in healthy behaviors (Franks et al., 2006 ;
Martire et al., 2012 ). Accordingly, increasing spousal support for healthy behaviors may
positively in ﬂuence health behaviors. Partner- or spouse-assisted lifestyle interventions

aim to do this by involving a spouse in supporting the patients ’behavior change.
Partner- and spouse-assisted interventions have contributed to improvements in a varietyof patient health behaviors (Martire, Schulz, Helgeson, Small, & Sagha ﬁ,
2010 ), includ-
ing diet and physical activity (Black, Gleser, & Kooyers, 1990 ; Burke, Beilin, Cutt,
Mansour, & Mori, 2008 ; Voils et al., 2013 ). However, the mechanisms by which
spouse-assisted interventions improve participant diet and physical activity have notbeen explored.
Social support is a key mechanism that is believed to contribute to the effectiveness
of spouse-assisted interventions. Social support from spouses for diet and physicalactivity can include a variety of behaviors, for example, providing encouraging wordsor cooking healthy meals for a spouse (Gallant,
2003 ). In addition to social support, a
spouse-assisted intervention to change health behaviors may be most effective if
patients ’self-ef ﬁcacy for the health behaviors is targeted. Social cognitive theory and
other health behavior theories posit a prominent causal role for self-ef ﬁcacy in health
behaviors, supported by research ﬁndings (Abusabha & Achterberg, 1997 ; Strecher,
DeVellis, Becker, & Rosenstock, 1986 ).
Couples Partnering for Lipid Enhancing Strategies (CouPLES) was a randomized
controlled trial that tested a spouse-assisted health behavior intervention (Voils et al.,
2013 ). CouPLES aimed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; primary
aim) and to induce health behavior change, including improvements in diet and physical
activity (secondary aims) among patients with elevated LDL-C. The intervention was
informed by social cognitive theory, which posits a key role for self-ef ﬁcacy and social
support (Bandura, 1997 ). Thus, the intervention targeted the intermediate constructs of
self-ef ﬁcacy and spousal support for a healthy diet and physical activity. Results showed
that LDL-C did not differ between the intervention and usual care groups at the ﬁnal
assessment. However, the intervention resulted in signi ﬁcantly lower intake of calories,
total fat, saturated fat, and percent total fat compared to usual care. Further, frequencyof physical activity was 20% higher in the intervention group than the control group, a
clinically meaningful but statistically insigni ﬁcant change. Physical activity duration,
cholesterol intake, and ﬁber intake did not change.
In order to evaluate hypotheses about the mechanisms of CouPLES ’s effects, in the
present study, we conducted statistical mediation analyses, which can test whether anintervention changed a targeted intermediate variable (an ‘action test ’); if change in a
targeted intermediate variable was associated with a change in an outcome variable (a‘conceptual test ’), and if an intervention ’s effects on an outcome variable were attribut-
able to its effects on the intermediate variable (an ‘indirect effects ’or mediation test;
Cerin & MacKinnon,
2009 ). In the current study, the action test tests the hypothesis that
the intervention increased four key intermediate variables: diet self-ef ﬁcacy, physical
activity self-ef ﬁcacy, spousal support for diet, and spousal support for physical activity.
The conceptual tests test the hypothesis that change in these intermediate variables isassociated with changes in diet and physical activity outcomes. The indirect effects ’
tests test whether the effects of the intervention on diet and physical activity were medi-ated through intermediate variables. We included in our analyses both outcomes thatwere signi ﬁcantly improved and those that did not signi ﬁcantly change during the
intervention because mediation can be present even in the absence of a signi ﬁcant
relationship between the intervention and outcome (MacKinnon,
2008 ).754 M.A. McVay et al.
Methods
Recruitment and inclusion criteria
The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. Electronic medical
record queries were conducted to identify Durham VA patients who were married, hadLDL-C ≥100 mg/dL, and had at least one primary care visit in the previous year.
Patients identi ﬁed via medical record query were mailed a recruitment letter and con-
tacted by telephone for screening followed by an in-person screening. Patients wereineligible if they or their spouse had inconsistent telephone access, impaired cognition
or hearing, health problems that interfered with participation, resided in a nursing home,
or received long term care. Further details on study methods are available in Voils et al.(
2009 ,2011,2013 ).
Procedures
Consented participants completed baseline measurements and then were randomized at a
1:1 ratio with strati ﬁed, block randomization (block size: 2). Randomization was
stratiﬁed by patient race (White vs. non-White) and CHD risk (high risk vs. moderate/
low risk). Participants were informed of randomization assignment by the study inter-ventionist nurse after obtaining baseline labs. The study nurse informed patients of theirrandomization assignment and delivered the intervention, allowing the other study staffwho conducted assessments to remain unaware of treatment assignment. Participantswere asked not to divulge randomization assignment to study staff conducting assess-ments. Assessments of outcome and mediators were conducted in person at 6 monthsand 11 months post-baseline. Participants and spouses were paid $10 –20 for outcome
assessments.
Usual care
Participants ’lipid disorders were managed by their providers. No contact was made
with study staff except for outcome assessments.
CouPLES intervention
The intervention comprised monthly telephone calls to participants and spouses. Calls
were delivered by a trained research nurse using custom software developed to guideintervention content according to intervention protocol. The ﬁrst call educated partici-
pants and spouses about hypercholesterolemia and self-management principles. Forspouses, this call also included orientation toward strategies for supporting participant ’s
goal attainment. On subsequent monthly calls (months 2 –5, 7–10), participants selected
the focus of the call from one of four content areas: diet, physical activity, participant –
physician communication, or medication adherence. Telephone calls to participants
consisted of goal setting and problem-solving focused on the selected content area.Participants made measurable behavioral goals and developed action plans, with anemphasis on guiding participants to set achievable, gradual goals to increase self-ef ﬁcacy.
During spousal phone calls, which occurred within one week of the participant calls,participants ’progress with previous goals and the next months ’goals and action plans
were discussed. Spouses were coached to develop a speci ﬁc behavior plan to support the
participant (e.g. change cooking habits, provide verbal reinforcement).Psychology, Health & Medicine 755
Two or more intervention calls were completed by 92% of randomized intervention
participants and 8 or more calls by 69% of participants (Voils et al., 2013 ). Average call
duration was 13.6 (SD = 6.3) minutes for patients and 8.8 (SD = 4.6) minutes forspouses. Participants selected diet in 51% of calls, physical activity in 49% of calls,
patient –provider communication in <1% of calls, and never selected medication manage-
ment. Spouses were asked if they would make the same behavior changes as participants,and did so for 97% dietary goals and 65% of physical activity goals. Spouse healthbehavior outcomes are described in King, Jeffreys, McVay, Coffman, and Voils (
2014 ).
Measures
Dietary intake
The Brief Block, 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ; Berkeley Nutrition
Services) measured dietary intake (Block, 2000 ). The FFQ was developed from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III food intake data.Participants indicate foods they have eaten over the past 6 months, including portionsize and frequency of intake. Dietary variables examined were those targeted for reduc-tion (calories, percent fat, percent saturated fat, and cholesterol) or increase ( ﬁber) dur-
ing the intervention in accordance with guidelines from the Adult Treatment Panel III
(National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,
2004 ).
Physical activity
The Community for Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) measure
assessed physical activity (Stewart et al., 2001 ). CHAMPS produces frequency of activity
(times per week) and duration of activity (minutes per week) scores. CHAMPS has dem-
onstrated validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change (Stewart et al., 2001 ). Moderate
intensity physical activity was the focus of the current study because of the importanceof this level of activity to health (US Department of Health Human Services,
2008 ).
Dietary self-ef ﬁcacy
Self-ef ﬁcacy for dietary intake was measured using the 15-item eating self-ef ﬁcacy scale
which has demonstrated validity (McCann et al., 1995 ). Participants reported their con ﬁ-
dence that they could adhere to a cholesterol lowering diet under a variety of circum-
stances (e.g. at a party with food) on a scale from 1 ( ‘not at all con ﬁdent’)t o1 0
(‘extremely con ﬁdent’). The measure ’s two subscales (Negative Affect and Socially
Acceptable Circumstances) were combined due to high correlations between itemsacross subscales. The internal consistency reliability of the measure in the current studywas strong (Baseline: α= .97, 6-month: α= .97).
Physical activity self-ef ﬁcacy
Physical activity self-ef ﬁcacy was measured with the validated self-ef ﬁcacy for exercise
scale (Resnick & Jenkins,
2000 ). This is a 9-item measure of participants ’conﬁdence
that they could exercise three times per week for 20 min under various circumstances(e.g. ‘if the weather were bad ’), rated on a scale from 1 ( ‘not at all con ﬁdent’)t o1 0
(‘extremely con ﬁdent’). Internal consistency reliability was strong in the current sample
(Baseline: α= .96, 6-month: α= .96).756 M.A. McVay et al.
Spousal support for healthy diet
Spousal support for healthy eating was measured with the validated Social Support and
Eating Habits Survey (Sallis, Grossman, Pinski, Patterson, & Nader, 1987 ). Participants
rated how often spouses engaged in encouraging and discouraging behaviors over theprevious three months on a scale from 1 ( ‘never ’)t o5( ‘very often ’). In the current
study, we used only the encouragement subscale of this measure (internal consistencyreliability, baseline: α= .84; 6-month: α= .83) due to poor psychometric properties of
the discouragement scale.
Spousal support for physical activity
Spousal support for physical activity was measured with the Family Support for
Exercise Scale (Sallis et al.,
1987 ). Participants rated how often their spouses engage in
certain supportive behaviors over the previous three months on a scale from 1 ( ‘never ’)
to 5 ( ‘very often ’). Only the participation and encouragement subscale was used
because the reward and punishment subscale had poor test –retest reliability in the vali-
dation study (Sallis et al., 1987 ) and unacceptable inter-item correlations in the current
sample. The subscale used has evidence of validity and had good internal consistency
reliability in the current study (baseline: α= .93; 6-month: α= .93).
Analyses
Analyses were conducted with structural equation modeling using Mplus (version 6.11)
(Muthen & Muthen, 2011). Separate models were ﬁt for each of the ﬁve dietary intake out-
comes and the two physical activity outcomes. Participants were analyzed in the group towhich they were randomized. Dietary self-ef ﬁcacy and spousal support were tested as
mediators for dietary outcomes, whereas physical activity self-ef ﬁcacy and spousal support
were tested as mediators for physical activity outcomes. Self-ef ﬁcacy and spousal support
were tested simultaneously in each model in order to determine the unique in ﬂuence of
each putative mediator. All variables were evaluated for normality prior to analyses.
Dietary outcomes
Model speci ﬁcations are shown in Figure
1. Putative mediators measured at 6 months
were regressed on intervention condition (usual care = 0; intervention = 1). Simulta-
neously, the 11-month outcome variable was regressed on 6-month putative mediatorsand intervention condition. Six-month mediators and the 11-month outcome variablewere all regressed on their baseline values and on the strati ﬁcation variables (CHD risk
group and race). Variables measured at the same time point were free to correlate withone another. Calories, cholesterol, and ﬁber were log-transformed prior to analyses to
address their skewed distribution (Voils et al.,
2013 ). Full information maximum likeli-
hood was used to estimate the models. The χ2test indicated absolute model ﬁt. Because
χ2is sensitive to sample size and model complexity, incremental model ﬁt was assessed
with root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; Steiger & Lind, 1980 ), compar-
ative ﬁt index (CFI; Bentler, 1990 ), and Tucker –Lewis Index (TLI; Tucker & Lewis,
1973 ). Conventional cut-offs for acceptable ﬁt are RMSEA < .06, CFI > .95 and
TLI > .95 (Hu & Bentler, 1999 ). The statistical signi ﬁcance of the indirect pathways
was determined using bootstrapping with 95% con ﬁdence limits (MacKinnon, 2008 ).
Coefﬁcients were standardized for ease of comparison.Psychology, Health & Medicine 757
Physical activity outcomes
Physical activity frequency and duration are count variables that followed a Poisson-
type process and thus required a different modeling approach (Voils et al., 2013 ). The
models were estimated in Mplus with maximum likelihood with numerical integrationusing Monte Carlo method, specifying a negative binomial model (Muthen & Muthen,
2011). Model speci ﬁcation was otherwise the same as for dietary outcomes (Figure 1).
Model ﬁt statistics are not available for models with endogenous count variables
(Muthen & Muthen, 2011); therefore, we compared this model to a model without
parameter estimates for the mediation pathways. Because these models were nested, ﬁt
was evaluated using the difference in −2 log likelihood, which followed a χ2
distribution. Standardized coef ﬁcients cannot be produced for physical activity variables
because count variables do not have residual variance parameters.
Results
Descriptive data
The initial sample included 255 participants (127 intervention and 128 usual care; see
Figure 2). The sample was 94.9% male, 64.9% White, and the average age was 61.3
(SD = 12.3) years. Table 1provides descriptive statistics on all putative mediators and
outcome variables. Tables 2and3provide correlation coef ﬁcients for all dietary and
physical activity variables, respectively.
Mediation models for dietary outcomes
The dietary models had marginally acceptable ﬁt (Table 4). Results from the action tests
(apathways) showed that the intervention led to improvements in dietary self-ef ﬁcacy
and participant perception of spousal support for healthy eating at 6 months. TheSelf-Efficacy

conceptual tests ( bpathways) showed that increases in dietary self-ef ﬁcacy and spousal
support from baseline to 6 months were not associated with changes in dietary outcomesat 11 months. The indirect effects test ( a*b) did not support a mediating effect of dietary
self-ef ﬁcacy or social support.
Mediation models for physical activity outcomes
The inclusion of the mediation pathways for both moderate intensity physical activity
frequency ( −2 log likelihood difference test: χ
2(4) = 19.302, p< .001) and duration ( χ2
(4) = 12.884, p= .01) improved model ﬁt over the model without mediation pathways.
The action tests ( apathways) revealed that the intervention led to increases in spousal
support but not self-ef ﬁcacy for physical activity at 6 months (Table 5). The conceptual
tests ( bpathways) showed that increases in 6-month physical activity self-ef ﬁcacy were
associated with increases in 11-month physical activity duration and frequency out-comes. The conceptual test did not support an in ﬂuence of changes in spousal support
for physical activity at 6 months on changes in physical activity outcomes. The indirecteffects test ( a*b) indicated an absence of mediation effects for both spousal support and
self-ef ﬁcacy.
Discussion
Identifying the mechanisms by which successful spouse-assisted health behavior inter-
ventions exert their effects or reasons they fail to in ﬂuence outcomes should lead to
intervention re ﬁnement and design of more effective interventions. To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study to examine mediators of a spouse-assisted intervention to improve
physical activity or diet.Baseline: Randomized

Theaction tests presented herein showed that the intervention increased dietary self-
efﬁcacy, spousal support for physical activity, and spousal support for a healthy diet.
These results support the effectiveness of a low-intensity, remotely delivered interven-tion for in ﬂuencing key constructs for improving health behavior. However, the inter-
vention did not signi ﬁcantly increase physical activity self-ef ﬁcacy. Although previous
studies of low-intensity interventions have reported increases in physical activity self-efﬁcacy (Dutton et al.,
2009 ; Lewis, Williams, Martinson, Dunsiger, & Marcus, 2012 ),
the population in the present study differs in that it was a Veteran population and thusTable 1. Descriptive data on putative psychosocial mediators and outcomes.

predominantly male, older, and likely to suffer from greater levels of pain, disability,
and osteoarthritis (Dominick, Golightly, & Jackson, 2006 ).
The conceptual test showed that change in physical activity self-ef ﬁcacy from base-
line to six months was positively associated with later physical activity frequency and
duration. In contrast, for the other putative mediators examined, we did not ﬁnd that
six-month changes were associated with later health behavior changes. The indirect
effects tests did not support the hypothesis that self-ef ﬁcacy or spousal support mediated
intervention effects. In past studies of interventions targeting social support, mixedﬁndings for its role as a mediator of diet and physical activity have been reported
(Papandonatos et al.,
2012 ; Rhodes & Pfaef ﬂi,2010 ; Van Dyck et al., 2011). The
current intervention differed from these previous studies in that it included direct coach-ing of the social support system and focused speci ﬁcally on support from spouses.
These results provide information on why the intervention did not have a greater
impact on participants ’physical activity intensity and duration. In particular, the action
tests show that the intervention was unable to produce an increase in physical activityself-ef ﬁcacy, which was hypothesized to be a key intermediate variable. Populations
similar to our sample may require a higher dose of intervention or different strategies toincrease exercise self-ef ﬁcacy. For example, patients may bene ﬁt from scheduled group
exercise training sessions tailored to their disability/chronic pain issues. Such sessionswould provide behavior modeling and vicarious experience, both strategies that enhance
self-ef ﬁcacy (Bandura,
1997 ). The conceptual test revealed that the increase in spousal
support for physical activity during the intervention did not in ﬂuence physical activity.
Different types of spousal support may be more effective at affecting physical activitylevels. For example, an emphasis on decreasing discouraging behaviors, rather thanincreasing encouraging behaviors, could be effective. Although we encouraged spousesto increase supportive behaviors and decrease unsupportive behaviors, the social supportfor physical activity measure may not have been sensitive enough to detect changes inthese constructs, or social support alone may be insuf ﬁcient to meaningfully increaseTable 3.

physical activity. The absence of mediation by the proposed intermediate constructs also
suggests the need to identify other factors that may be accounting for the intervention ’s
effects (e.g. patient motivation).
Study limitations include use of self-report measures and marginally acceptable
model ﬁt. Generalizability of results may be limited, as the inferential population is pre-
dominantly male, middle-aged veterans. Our study also had several strengths. There isgrowing interest in designing interventions that include participants ’social network;
however, few of these interventions have been subject to analyses to determine interven-
tion mechanisms. The study intervention was theoretically based, and the analyses con-
ducted were designed to rigorously examine the theory in the context of an interventionwith high potential for dissemination.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrated that the CouPLES
intervention increased several of the putative mediators targeted; however, increases inspousal support and dietary self-ef ﬁcacy did not mediate intervention outcomes. Other
potential mediators of spouse-assisted interventions should be identi ﬁed in order to
inform intervention re ﬁnement.
