Abstract
Introduction: Media interventions can potentially play a major role in influencing health policies. This integrative
systematic review aimed to assess the effects of planned media interventions —including social media —on the
health policy-making process.
Methods: Eligible study designs included randomized and non-randomized designs, economic studies, process
evaluation studies, stakeholder analyses, qualitative methods, and case studies. We electronically searched Medline,
EMBASE, Communication and Mass Media Complete, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the WHO
Global Health Library. We followed standard systematic review methodology for study selection, data abstraction,
and risk of bias assessment.
Results: Twenty-one studies met our eligibility criteria: 10 evaluation studies using either quantitative ( n=7 )o r
qualitative ( n= 3) designs and 11 case studies. None of the evaluation studies were on social media. The findings of
the evaluation studies suggest that media interventions may have a positive impact when used as accountability
tools leading to prioritizing and initiating policy discussions, as tools to increase policymakers ’awareness, as tools to
influence policy formulation, as awareness tools leading to policy adoption, and as awareness tools to improve
compliance with laws and regulations. In one study, media-generated attention had a negative effect on policy
advocacy as it mobilized opponents who defeated the passage of the bills that the media intervention advocated
for. We judged the confidence in the available evidence as limited due to the risk of bias in the included studies
and the indirectness of the evidence.
Conclusion: There is currently a lack of reliable evidence to guide decisions on the use of media interventions to
influence health policy-making. Additional and better-designed, conducted, and reported primary research is needed
to better understand the effects of media interventions, particularly social media, on health policy-making processes,
and the circumstances under which media interventions are successful.

Background
Media interventions are defined as organized and purposive
activities that utilize a variety of media channels to inform,
persuade, or motivate populations [1]. In health care, media
interventions can convey health-related information includ-
ing research evidence to the public, policymakers, and
health professionals [2 –6]. They can also influence individ-
ual health behaviors [7]. For instance, media campaigns
were shown to be effective in decreasing tobacco uptake,
reducing alcohol-impaired driving and alcohol-related
crashes and influencing health services utilization [8 –10].
In the area of policy-making, media can contribute to
setting the agenda for the press, the public, and policy-
makers through highlighting what issues are newsworthy
at a particular time [11]. Media can also influence how
the public and policymakers view or think about certain
issues through selecting some aspects of a perceived
reality and making them more salient in a communicating
text [12]. Another way media can influence policymakers
is through shaping public opinion, which in turn, exerts
pressure on policymakers to respond [13]. For instance,
media advocacy is known as a popular strategy in public
health that can assist in increasing public awareness and
mobilizing decision-makers for policy change [14, 15].
When examining the various functions that media
interventions can play in the health field, it is important to
consider new interactive inf ormation and communication
platforms, particularly social media including blogs, social
networking sites, and interactive websites. While traditional
media, mainly television, still account for a large audience,
the influence of social media i sc o n s t a n t l yi n c r e a s i n ga n d
cannot be ignored [16, 17]. Social media increase user
interaction, provide peer support, and extend access to
health interventions [16, 17]. Social media also bring a
new dimension to health care as they provide the public,
patients, and health profe ssionals with a platform to
exchange on different health matters potentially affecting
population health outcomes [18].
A number of systematic reviews on the impact of
media interventions on health behavior and their use in
increasing awareness and education exist [16, 19, 20].
However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic re-
view assessing the role of media interventions in the
different stages of health policy-making. Our objective
is to better inform those considering the use of media
interventions to influence health policy-making. There-
fore, we conducted this integrative review to assess the
effects of planned media interventions on the health
policy-making process.
Method
Protocol and registration
A protocol for this review is registered in PROSPERO Inter-
national prospective register of systematic reviews underregistration number PROSPERO 2015:CRD42015020243
[21]. While we had planned in the protocol to start the
search with the year 2000, following our discussion
with a media expert, we changed the date to the year
2005 —the year of the rise of “web 2.0 ”. Web 2.0 allowed
users of the web to interact and generate content espe-
cially through social media [22]. Around that time,
traditional mainstream media also started to more ser-
iously integrate social media within their operations.
Methodology
We used the integrative review methodology that aims
to include a range of studies from different methodological
approaches (both experimenta l and non-experimental). We
followed the five stages of an integrative review by
Whittmore et al.: problem formulation, literature search,
data evaluation, data analysis, and data presentation [23].
This methodology is meant to protect against bias, en-
hance rigor, and improve accuracy of conclusions [23].
Problem formulation
Herein the definitions of terms used in the research
question:
Media interventions
Media interventions are described as organized and pur-
posive activities that utilize a variety of media channels
to inform, persuade, or motivate populations [1]. Given
that the goal of this review was to inform those inter-
ested in using media interventions to affect health policy-
making, we restricted our eligibility to studies where the
primary purpose of using media was to affect policy-
making (i.e., media as planned intervention). For example,
we excluded studies where unplanned media coverage
influenced health policy-making or where media coverage
followed a health policy change. To make this distinction,
we adopted the terminology used by a published Cochrane
review on a related topic —effects of mass media on the
utilization of health services —to distinguish between the
two approaches: planned campaigns/interventions and
unplanned media coverage [10].
Public policy
Public policy referred to government policy such as
any statement or position taken by the government or
government departments [13]. We only considered
public policies pertaining to health. We adopted the
stages heuristic framework that divides the public policy
process into five stages: agenda-setting, policy formula-
tion, adoption, implementation, and evaluation. Agenda-
setting is the stage during which issues or subjects reach
the policy agenda and get the attention of policymakers.
In the formulation and adoption stages, legislatures and
other decision-makers design policies and adopt policyBou-Karroum et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:52 Page 2 of 14
solutions in the form of legislation or rules. In the imple-
mentation stage, governments carry out an adopted policy
and resources are mobilized. Finally, the evaluation stage
aims at assessing whether policies have achieved their
intended objectives [24, 25].
Outcomes of interest
Our outcomes of interest were the impact of the interven-
tion on the different stages of the policy process, as de-
fined above: agenda-setting, policy formulation, adoption,
implementation, and evaluation. We only included studies
that assessed the effects of media on policy outcome. For
this purpose, we used a framework that provides indica-
tors to assess the influence of media advocacy on policy
outcomes. Some of the indicators include speeches and
statements, mentions in official documents, new policy or
legislation, and increased enforcement of a policy. We did
not consider surrogate outcomes such as the impact on
media coverage, community, or public opinion [26].
Literature search
Eligibility criteria
We considered as eligible for this integrative review the
following:
–Study designs: randomized studies, non-randomized
studies, economic studies, process evaluation studies,
stakeholder analyses, qualitative studies, and case
studies. We excluded editorials, commentaries, news
articles, letters, conference papers, proposals, re-
views, and studies published only in abstract format;
–Planned media interventions (e.g., advocacy activities,
media campaigns) implemented as stand-alone or as
part of multicomponent interventions, including social
media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs), broadcast media
(radio, television), print medi a (newspapers, newsletters,
magazines, leaflets, posters, and pamphlets), and
electronic media (websites). The media interventions
should have targeted a specific population such as
specific communities, policymakers, groups, or
associations;
–Setting: any country, state, or community;
–Studies that assessed the impact of media
interventions on one of the policy stages as defined
in the stages heuristic framework: agenda-setting
(setting the policy agenda and establishing priorities),
policy formulation, adoption, implementation, and
evaluation [ 24]. We excluded studies that did not
formally assess the association between media
exposure and policy-making (e.g., assessed surrogate
outcomes such as increasing exposure, engagement,
and preferences of the public for certain
policies).Search strategy
We searched Medline, EMBASE, Communication and
Mass Media Complete, Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the WHO Global
Health Library. We developed the search strategies
used in the different databases in consultation with an
expert librarian. We used both free text search terms
and MeSH terms (see details for the different electronic
databases in Additional file 1). We ran the search from
January 2005 until June 2015. We did not restrict the
search to specific languages. We also screened the refer-
ence lists of included studies to retrieve additional studies,
and we contacted experts in the field (including authors of
included studies) to get additional material.
Selection process
We imported the search results into Endnote X7 and re-
moved duplicates. Before starting the selection process,
and in order to ensure its reliability, all the reviewers
participated in a calibration exercise using a randomly
chosen sample of 100 citations.
The selection process consisted of two stages:
1. Title and abstract screening: Teams of two reviewers
(LBK, MS, AD, MA, CD) used the eligibility criteria
to screen titles and abstracts of identified citations in
duplicate and independently for potential eligibility.
Then, they retrieved the full-texts for citations
judged as potentially eligible by at least one of the
two reviewers.
2. Full-text screening: Teams of two reviewers (LBK,
NH, YF, UO, MS) used the same eligibility criteria to
screen the full-texts in duplicate and independently
for eligibility. At this stage, the two reviewers compared
results and resolved disagreement by discussion. The
reviewers aimed not to force consensus, and when
consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer (FJ or
EAA) made the final decision. We used standardized
and pilot-tested screening forms. We documented the
reason for study exclusion.
We used Fleiss ’Kappa coefficient to calculate agree-
ment between reviewers for full-text screening. We used
the following values to judge the degree of agreement:
0.21–0.40 for fair agreement, 0.41 –0.60 for moderate
agreement, 0.61 –0.80 for substantial agreement, and
0.81–1.00 for almost perfect agreement [27].
Data evaluation
Throughout the process of data abstraction, two reviewers
abstracted data from eligible studies in duplicate and inde-
pendently. We used standardized and piloted data abstrac-
tion forms. We conducted a calibration exercise on a
randomly chosen sample to ensure adequate agreement.Bou-Karroum et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:52 Page 3 of 14
The reviewers resolved their disagreements by discussion
or with the help of a third reviewer when consensus could
not be reached.
We collected the following information from each in-
cluded evaluation study: objectives, type of study design,
details of the methodology, study setting (health topic and
jurisdiction), population, characteristics of the media
intervention, type of media used, outcome assessed, study
theme, results, and limitations of the study. We abstracted
from each included case study the study ’s name and coun-
try, health topic, type of media used, characteristics of the
media intervention, and policy outcome.
As part of data evaluation, we appraised the methodo-
logical quality of included studies using tools appropriate
to the study design. Two reviewers (LBK, NH) assessed
the quality of included studies independently and resolved
disagreements through discussion or with the help of a
third reviewer when needed. We considered the following
tools for assessing the risk of bias (quantitative) and
quality of reporting (qualitative) of the included studies:
/C15The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials;
/C15A modified version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool
for non-randomized studies (A Cochrane Risk Of
Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies
of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI);
/C15The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of
Care (EPOC) risk of bias criteria for controlled
before and after studies and interrupted time series;
/C15The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool
for qualitative studies;
/C15A tool adapted from Lotfi et al. [ 28] to assess the
methodological features of quantitative studies using
surveys including the following criteria: sample size
calculation, reporting of a sampling frame, the
sampling method, the response rate, and the validity
of the survey.
Data analysis and presentation
We stratified the studies based on the stages of the policy-
making process. We conducted thematic analysis of all
papers reflecting the role of media as reported in each
study and presented the results in a narrative sum-
mary by stage. Two reviewers (LBK, NH) identified
the themes. A third reviewer (GH) settled any discrep-
ancy. We did not identify a mix of quantitative and
qualitative data for any of the stages we examined;
therefore, we could not conc lude whether the included
studies confirmed, refuted, or complemented each
other [29].
As for case studies, we summarized them in a table
(see Additional file 2) listing the study ’s name and country,
health topic, type of media used, and characteristics of the
media intervention and policy outcome.Results
Study selection
Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow chart summarizing the
study selection process. Out of 13,674 citations, we iden-
tified 21 eligible studies: 10 evaluation studies and 11
case studies. We excluded 530 articles at the full-text
screening phase for the following reasons: not an inter-
vention of interest ( n= 148), not about public health
policy ( n= 155), not an outcome of interest ( n= 164),
and not the design of interest ( n= 63). Additional file 2
provides detailed descriptions of the 11 case studies
[30–40]. We provide below the characteristics and re-
sults of the 10 evaluation studies [41 –50].
Characteristics of the included evaluation studies
Table 1 describes the characteristics of the 10 eligible
evaluation studies [41 –50], including study design, setting,
population, media intervention (type and nature), and
outcome assessed.
Study design
The designs of the 10 evaluation studies were
/C15Quantitative ( n= 7): before and after design ( n=2 )
[47,48], event history analysis ( n=1 )[ 45], media
and document analysis ( n=1 )[ 44], and cross-sectional
survey ( n=3 )[ 42,43,46]. Two of those studies
included qualitative components that were not
relevant to our question [ 42,43].
/C15Qualitative ( n= 3): interviews ( n=1 )[ 41], media
analysis ( n=1 )[ 50], and content analysis ( n=1 )[ 49].
Setting and population
Except for one study that was conducted in Pakistan [41],
the included studies were conducted in high-income coun-
tries: USA ( n=4 ) , N e w Z e a l a n d ( n=1 ) , A u s t r a l i a ( n=1 ) ,
Canada ( n=2 ) , a n d S w e d e n ( n= 1). One study targeted
policymakers only [41], three targeted the public only
[46–48], and six targeted both [42 –45, 49, 50].
The health topics were water fluoridation ( n= 2), alcohol
control ( n= 2), tobacco control ( n= 1), road safety ( n=1 ) ,
maternal and newborn health ( n= 1), nursing education
(n= 1), access to health care ( n=1 ) ,a n df o o di n s e c u r i t y
(n=1 ) .
Type of media assessed
All campaigns relied on the use of traditional media
(including broadcast and print media); none included
social media. Media activities included a combination
of paid media and earned media, where the topic received
recognition and gained publicity for free. Examples of en-
countered media activities were advertisements ( n= 1) [48],
news coverage of events and campaigns ( n= 3) [44, 48, 50],
media interviews ( n= 3) [42, 44, 50], TV talk shows ( n=1 )Bou-Karroum et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:52 Page 4 of 14
[41], creating videos ( n= 2) [42, 49], launching of websites
(n= 1) [42], framing and releasing of news and press re-
leases ( n= 3) [43, 45, 50], letters to the editor ( n=3 )
[42, 43, 46], provision of information kits to media ( n=2 )
[43, 46], press conferences ( n= 2) [47, 49], and media
events ( n= 1) [45].
Nature of the intervention
/C15In four studies, the media intervention was part of a
multi-component intervention, where authors assessed
the effect of the whole intervention on policy outcome.
Other components included enforcement campaign
[48], parent meetings, merchant meetings, visits to
shops, postcards to parents, letters to merchants,
training of staff [ 47], policy advocacy and community
action projects [ 43], and a public forum [ 46].
/C15In three studies, the media activities were part of a
broad intervention progr am but authors assessedthe effect of the media component on policy
outcome [ 42,44,45].
/C15In three studies, the media intervention was
implemented alone and the effect of the media on
policy outcome was explored [ 41,49,50].
Outcomes assessed
/C15Impact on agenda-setting assessed as change in
policy priorities/approach of policymakers and as
stimulating inquiries and discussions from policy-
makers [ 41,49].
/C15Impact on policy formulation assessed as change in
content of government policy [ 50].
/C15Impact on policy adoption assessed as passage of
bills and ordinances [ 44,45], as change in policies or
increased funding to clinics [ 42], and as adoption of
a new policy [ 43,46].
/C15Impact on policy implementation assessed as
increased enforcement of law, in particular change

Media intervention was part of a multi-component intervention named “The beer campaign ”that
consisted of a series of activities involving information/training, media advocacy, and monitoring.
In 1998, The intervention also included meetings with merchants, sending post card to parents,
training of staff, and media advocacy. In 1999, a follow-up study indicated no improvements, which
was followed by a renewed intervention, with added components: merchants received individual
feedback on sales in their shops, and they committed themselves to buy back the beer that was
sold to the students in the study.
The media advocacy consisted of presenting the baseline purchase study and follow-up study a
year later at press conferences. The results were presented in several newspapers, local radio, and
television. Contacts were maintained with both local and national media during the following year.

advocacy.
Media advocacy included proactive and reactive media releases in local newspapers, letters to the
editors of various communities and local newspapers. Other channels used were the provision
of information on the District Health Boards (DHB) websites, participation in newspapers and radio
interviews (e.g., talkback shows on the radio) and information through school newsletters. Positive
messages were released to the media from Northland DHB and a network of supporters was
established to respond to any letters or other initiatives from opponents of community water
fluoridation. The timing of the positive publicity and reopening of the fluoridation issue was
important in gaining support from other health professionals, M āori health providers, PHOs and
the community.

Methodological appraisal
Additional file 3 summarizes the detailed assessment of
the methodological appraisal of the 10 evaluation studies.
Using the CASP tool, we judged the qualitative study to
be of high quality as it reported on 8 of 10 criteria of the
tool [41]. Using the tool adapted from Lotfi et al. [28], we
judged the three quantitative survey studies to be at high
risk of bias since they suffered from a number of meth-
odological limitations [42, 43, 46]. The same applied to
the controlled before and after study [47], using the EPOC
risk of bias criteria. We were not able to find tools to as-
sess the methodological quality of the other five studies.
So we assessed their limitations narratively (see Additional
file 3). Overall, they all suffered from at least one major
limitation (mainly related to confounding), so we judged
them to be at high risk of bias.
Effects of media interventions on policy outcomes
Additional file 4 provides themes and results of individual
studies. We present below the findings organized accord-
ing to the stages heuristic framework of the public policy
process and present the overarching effect of media on
each stage highlighted in italic font [24].Agenda-setting
Two qualitative studies have assessed media interventions
as stand-alone interventions and found positive percep-
tions regarding the impact of media on agenda-setting.
Haq et al. [41] used a qualitative study design to exam-
ine the use of media as accountability tools leading to
prioritizing and initiating policy discussions . The study
evaluated a television talk show in Pakistan aiming to
get on-camera commitments from key officials and
policymakers belonging to di strict health policy. The
interviews with the officials and policymakers 6 months
following the TV talk show suggested that this media
accountability tool was an “effective ”strategy in setting
maternal and newborn health as a priority health issue
in the targeted districts, as perceived by the inter-
viewees. The effectiveness of television talk show was
based on the perceptions of the interviewees [41].
Rock et al. [49] used a content analysis design to qualita-
tively examine media as tools to increase policymakers ’
awareness in Canada in 2008. The media intervention
intended to convey the message that income-related
food insecurity is a serious population health problem.
The authors of this study reported that the media inter-
vention generated interest within the Government of
Canada and the Government of Alberta, in particular,
stimulated discussion in the Alberta Legislature andTable 1 Characteristics of included studies (Continued)

sparked inquiries from the Senate Committee on Social
Affairs Subcommittee on Cities and from a political
staff member [49].
Policy formulation
Leurer [50] used a qualitative media analysis to examine
t h er o l eo f media as advocacy tools to influence policy
formulation . The authors of the study reported that media
advocacy efforts of nursing stakeholders in Saskatchewan,
Canada, increased public pressure that in return led the
government to revise its policy that originally intended to
impose a 3-year diploma entry requirement despite
opposition from the licensing body. They also noted that
what happened in Saskatchewan “stands in contrast to the
neighboring province of Manitoba where the government ’s
announcement of a reintroduction of the diploma entry
requirement in 2000, within weeks of the Saskatchewan
announcement, was implemented ”[50].
Policy adoption
All the five studies that examined the effect of media on
policy adoption were quantitative [42 –46]. All five focused
onmedia as awareness tools leading to policy adoption .
The differences were in the targets of the planned media.
All but one study, Harwood et al. [44], suggested that
media interventions were successful in achieving the
intended goals.
Harwood et al. [44] assessed the association between
media attention to alcohol issues and the legislative success
of related bills. A detailed analysis of media covers four
alcohol policies: bans on minors in bars, increases in
alcohol taxes, beer keg registration, and zero tolerance
f o rt e e nd r i v i n gu n d e rt h ei n f l u e n c eo fa l c o h o l .T h e
analysis showed that out of the five bills that success-
fully passed, four received little or no media attention
while all the bills that were defeated received intense
media coverage. The authors speculated that press
attention may have hindered the passage of bills through
mobilizing opponents but they provided no details on
those “opponents ”or whether they run any counter cam-
paigns. The authors also concluded that press inattention
may give stakeholders the opportunity to compromise
during negotiations on bill content and wording [44].
Niederdeppe et al. [45] suggested that media awareness
efforts implemented as part of the Florida Tobacco Control
Program (FTCP) in FL, USA, were effective in generating
news coverage and promoting policy change —the passage
of the tobacco product placement ordinances (TPPO).
TPPO are designed to reduce youth smoking by removing
the visual and physical availability of cigarettes, requiring
retailers to place cigarettes and other tobacco products
behind the counter. The study found that a one-unit in-
crease in news coverage on Students Working Against
Tobacco, a part of the FTCP, was associated with a 94%increase in the odds of counties enacting a TPPO ( p
value <0.05). The effect persisted when the analysis
controlled for community mobilization and pro-tobacco
marketing influences [45].
Two studies (Sivaneswaran et al. and Gowda et al.)
a s s e s s e dt h er o l eo f media as awareness tools to gain public
support leading to policy adoption [43, 46]. Sivaneswaran et
al. [46] explored the role of a multicomponent education
campaign including the use of media to educate and
increase awareness about the importance of water
fluoridation. The purpose of the campaign was to gain
public support before the adoption and implementation of
the water fluoridation policy in two rural towns in New
South Wales, Australia, in 2005. Thus, the Mid-Western
Regional Council commissioned an independent rural
research organization to survey households in those two
communities to assess their support of the fluoridation.
The survey found that newspapers followed by radio and
television ( n= 80) were the most common sources of
information (86%). Among those who were informed, 59%
indicated that they were supportive of the policy com-
pared with 47% among those not informed. Although the
authors do not explicitly provide evidence for the link
between public opinion and policy adoption, they make a
clear statement supporting that link: “the pro-fluoridation
decision was influenced by the majority of community
support for the measure ”[46].
Gowda et al. [43] evaluated a fluoridation advocacy
program implemented in Northland, New Zealand.
Media were employed as part of the advocacy program
to raise awareness and to promote water fluoridation
among the community and decision-makers. The authors
reported on a community consultation survey that showed
that the public was in favor of fluoridation in two districts
of Northland (53 and 56%). Although Gowda et al. did not
explicitly provide evidence for the link between public
opinion and policy adoption, they clearly stated that
obtaining “a simple majority in favor of fluoridation led
directly to the District Council ’s resolution to fluoridate ”.
The authors of the study judged that positive publicity
and messages, the timing, and the reopening of the
fluoridation issue were important in gaining support for
fluoridation from other health providers, health organi-
zations, and the community [43].
Gardner et al. [42] explored the role of media advocacy
as tools for increasing awaren ess of policymakers on com-
munity clinics ’issues and leading to policy adoption. A sur-
vey of policymakers, community leaders, and stakeholders
in 2003 and 2004 reported that 60% of the 2003 and 42% of
the 2004 respondents perceived Clinic Consortia media
activities to be “very effective ”at increasing their awareness
of community clinics ’issues. Nearly all (95%) clinic organi-
zations and associations surveyed rated media as “effective ”
in increasing policymaker awareness. However, only 20% ofBou-Karroum et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:52 Page 10 of 14
the clinic organizations and associations reported that the
m e d i aw e r es u c c e s s f u li na c h i e v i n gap o l i c yc h a n g eo ri n -
creasing funding to the clinics [42]. The effectiveness of
media advocacy in this paper was based on the perceptions
of the respondents.
Policy implementation
Two before and after studies examined media as awareness
tools to improve compliance with laws and regulations.
While the two studies found positive effects on compliance
with laws and regulations, media interventions were part of
multi-component interventions [47, 48].
Rehnman et al. [47] explored the effects of “the beer
campaign ”conducted in 1999 and 2000 in Stockholm,
Sweden. The campaign aimed to reduce the sale of beer
to under-aged youths. The media advocacy campaign
was not clearly described and was only one of many
components of the intervention that also involved parent
meetings, merchant meetings, visits to shops (with feedback
and commitment for the 2000 intervention), postcards to
parents, letters to merchants, and training of staff. The
authors of this study reported on a comparison area but
did not specify whether any intervention was implemented
there. The study found that in the intervention area, the
percentage of successful beer purchase attempts varied
from 66% at baseline to 73% at the end of the first year and
to 44% at the end of the second year. The values in the
comparison area were respec tively 60, 86, and 44%. This
study provides insufficient evidence on the role of media
advocacy in the observed results [47].
Vasudevan et al. [48] assessed the effects of media and
a“seat belt ”law enforcement campaign in the state of
NV, USA, on increasing the seat belt usage rates. The
campaign, Click it or Ticket, was conducted during the
month of May over 3 years (2003 –2005). The authors
collected seat belt usage rates among both drivers and
passengers pre-campaign (March and April) and post
campaign (June and August). They found that the over-
all seat belt usage rate significantly increased from 73.9
to 78.9% in 2003 ( pvalue <0.001), from 81.8 to 86.6% in
2004 ( pvalue <0.001), and from 88.4 to 94.8% in 2005 ( p
value <0.001). The authors of this study concluded that
“effectively coupling media and enforcement campaigns ”
led to a “significant increase in seat belt usage ”[48].
Policy evaluation
No studies were found to examine the role of media in
policy evaluation.
Discussion
Summary of findings
This integrative systematic review identified 10 eligible
studies that evaluated the effects of planned media inter-
ventions on the different stages of the health policy-makingprocess, except for the policy evaluation stage. None of the
evaluation studies assessed social media interventions. We
judged all 10 studies to be at high risk of bias. The findings
of the evaluation studies suggest that media interventions
may have a positive impact when used as accountability
tools leading to prioritizing and initiating policy discussions,
as tools to increase policymakers ’awareness, as tools to
influence policy formulation, as awareness tools leading to
policy adoption (and to gain public support leading to
policy adoption), and as awareness tools to improve com-
pliance with laws and regulations. In one study, media-
created attention had a negative effect on policy advocacy
as it mobilized opponents who defeated the passage of the
bills that the media intervention advocated for [44]. One
could speculate that the reason for such defeat may be due
to more effective counter-media interventions funded and
supported by powerful special interests and stakeholders.
In addition, the available evidence suggested a number of
factors as possible predictors of the success of the interven-
tions. These include the timing of media publicity, building
relationships with the media, the mobilization of oppo-
nents, and the concomitant use of other strategies such as
enforcement campaigns and community mobilization and
engagement [42 –44, 46, 49]. This suggests that media inter-
ventions do not occur in isolation and a number of factors
should be taken in consideration while designing a media
campaign for policy change.
Research gaps in the field
A methodological review of published evidence maps found
that the most popular domains used to classify evidence
gaps were study design, interven tions, setting, population,
and outcomes [51]. We present in Table 2 the research gaps
relevant to the “use of media to impact health policy-
making ”according to those domains. Similarly, we used a
Table 2 Identified Research Gaps

framework developed by Robinson et al. to discuss the
reasons behind the research gaps [52]. Using that
framework, we identified three reasons related to the
topic under review: (1) the bias in conducting research,
(2) the indirectness of the evidence, and (3) the insuffi-
ciency of information. First, the included studies suffered
from at least one major methodological limitation, mainly
confounding, that makes their findings potentially biased.
Second, in the majority of the studies, the media interven-
tion was part of a multi-component intervention or part
of larger programs, making the evidence indirect. Conse-
quently, it was not possible to isolate the effects of media
as stand-alone interventions. This approach to interven-
tion design may be due to the fact that using media as
stand-alone interventions might not be sufficient when
aiming to impact policy [42], given the multiple and
complex factors that affect the policy-making process
[13]. One additional limitation is that in the survey and
interview studies, the outcomes were assessed based on
perceptions of respondents on effectiveness of media
interventions and not actual evaluation of effectiveness.
The aforementioned challenges and limitations of the
included studies made it difficult to make any inferences
on effectiveness as the authors of these papers do not
explicitly provide an evidence for the link between the
intervention and the outcome. Thus, we reported the
results cautiously and relied on what the authors of the
included papers reported. Third, our review showed
limited quantity of research on the effects of planned
media interventions and social media in particular on
health policy-making.
Another major challenge in the reporting of most of
the included studies is the very limited description of
the media interventions, knowing that these qualify as
complex interventions. This makes it difficult to under-
stand the specific media intervention that was tested, and
what component of that complex intervention might have
been effective. Indeed, two other systematic reviews exam-
ining the effectiveness of mass media on health services
utilization [10] and on reducing alcohol-impaired driving
and alcohol-related crashes [53] identified similar limita-
tions in terms of the description of the intervention.
There is also a dearth of studies reporting on the
effectiveness of media interventions on health policies
in low middle-income countries (LMIC). This may be
linked to the fact that the production of Health Policy
and Systems Research (HPSR) is still in its infancy in
these countries [54 –56].
We are aware of a number of systematic reviews asses-
sing the use of media/social media in clinical medicine
and public health. For instance, media interventions were
assessed for their impact on smoking cessation [8], redu-
cing the risk of alcohol-related injuries or crashes [53], in-
creasing child survival in LMICs [57], and changing healthbehavior in fields such as HIV prevention [20, 58] and
physical activity [19, 59]. Two reviews identified evidence
that mass media campaigns can in fact have positive
impact [8, 57]. Patel et al. showed that using social
media, especially Facebook and blogs, likely improves
care for patients with chronic disease [60]. Stellefson et
al. reported that Web 2.0 can benefit older adults in
managing their diseases [61]. Social media were also
shown to be used for a variety of conditions and pur-
poses in child health [62].
Implications for research and policy
This systematic review can inform researchers and funders
interested in understanding the interaction between the
media and the policy worlds. Researchers are encouraged
to conduct more and better-designed primary research
studies on social media interventions given the rise of
their use in the recent decade and potential impact on
policy-making. Researchers should develop and follow
guidelines for designing and evaluating complex media in-
terventions. Moreover, there is a need for better reporting
of studies in this field, taking into consideration guidelines
for the reporting of complex interventions when describ-
ing the media intervention used [63 –65].
This systematic review highlighted the challenges of
evaluating the impact of media advocacy on health
policy given the difficulties in applying experimental
methods, the complex nature of these interventions,
and the multiple factors influencing the policy-making
process [13, 26]. Future primary studies and system-
atic reviews should include process evaluation and
qualitative components to explore factors behind suc-
cesses and failures, the impact of the context, and ele-
ments of best practices in health policy-making media
campaigns [66]. Furthermo re, future research should
focus on the influence of media on health policy-
making in diverse settings. Examining the role of
m e d i ai nt h e s eL M I C si si m p o r t a n tt od e s i g nc o n t e x t -
specific strategies and understand how the impact of
media campaigns and interventions can differ across
various health systems and so cioeconomic realities.
Funding agencies are also called to support future
studies particularly in LMICs, where research produc-
tion is still at its early stages, and support capacity
building for research in the field of HPSR.
Our findings can also inform, to some extent, civil
society organizations, advocacy groups, and researchers
working to influence policy-making when considering
media as tools for policy change. One particular important
finding that emerged is the unintended effects of
media campaigns to energize opponents. This implies
that any media intervention has to be carefully de-
signed and thought through to take into account such
situations.Bou-Karroum et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:52 Page 12 of 14
Strengths and limitations
This review has two main strengths. First, and to our
knowledge, this is the first systematic review examining
the effects of planned media interventions, including
social media, on health policy-making. Second, we have
conducted the review using standard, explicit, and rigorous
methods [67] and we follow ed standard methods for
reporting systematic reviews [68]. This includes a very
comprehensive search, including of the Communication
and Mass Media Complete database, the main database
for media-related articles. One limitation of this review
is the use of stages heuristic framework while some
academics consider it to assume linearity of the public
policy process that does not exist in real world. How-
ever, it did help us synthesize the identified evidence by
providing a simplified and useful way in viewing the
entire public policy process [24].
