Abstract
Background: Numerous agencies are providing training, technical assistance, and other support to build
community-based practitioners ’capacity to adopt and implement evidence-based prevention interventions.
Yet, little is known about how best to design capacity-building interventions to optimize their effectiveness.
Wandersman et al. (Am J Community Psychol.50:445 –59, 2102) proposed the Evidence -Based System of
Innovation Support (EBSIS) as a framework to guide research and thereby strengthen the evidence base for
building practitioners ’capacity. The purpose of this review was to contribute to further development of the
EBSIS by systematically reviewing empirical studies of ca pacity-building interventions to identify (1) the range
of strategies used, (2) variations in the way they were st ructured, and (3) evidence for their effectiveness at
increasing practitioners ’capacity to use evidence-based prevention interventions.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for Engl ish-language articles reporting findings of
empirical studies of capacity-build ing interventions that were publis hed between January 2000 and January
2014 and were intended to increase use of evidence-based prevention interventions in non-clinical settings.
To maximize review data, studies were not excluded a priori based on design or methodological quality. Using
the EBSIS as a guide, two researchers independently extracted data from included studies. Vote counting and
meta-summary methods were used to summarize findings.
Results: The review included 42 publications reporting findings from 29 studies. In addition to confirming the
strategies and structures described in the EBSIS, the re view identified two new strategies and two variations
in structure. Capacity-building interventions we re found to be effective at increasing practitioners ’adoption
(n= 10 of 12 studies) and implementation ( n= 9 of 10 studies) of evidence-based interventions. Findings
were mixed for interventions ’effects on practitioners ’capacity or intervention planning behaviors. Both the
type and structure of capacity-building strategies may ha ve influenced effectiveness. The review also identified
contextual factors that may require variations in the w ays capacity-building interventions are designed.

Conclusions: Based on review findings, refinements are suggested to the EBSIS. The refined framework moves
the field towards a more comprehensive and standa rdized approach to conceptualizing the types and
structures of capacity-building strategies. This standa rdization will assist with synthesizing findings across
studies and guide capacity-building practice and research.

Evidence-based practice
Background
Public health and other community-based practitioners
have access to a growing menu of evidence-based inter-
ventions (EBIs) to promote health and prevent disease.
These EBIs include a range of programs, policies, and
practices that have been shown to be effective at improv-
ing environments, behaviors, and health outcomes [1].
Practitioners continue to underuse prevention EBIs, in
part because they lack the ability and motivation to do
so [2, 3]. In response to this challenge, a growing num-
ber of agencies are intervening to build practitioners ’
capacity [4, 5], which we define as the provision of on-
going support for the purpose of increasing practi-
tioners ’awareness, knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and
motivation to adopt and implement EBIs [6]. Despite ex-
tensive investments in capacity building, little is known
about how best to design capacity-building interventions
to optimize their effectiveness [7].
Wandersman and colleagues have proposed two frame-
works that describe constructs central to capacity building
[8, 9]. The Interactive Systems Framework (ISF) for Dis-
semination and Implementatio n (2008) posits that transfer-
ring EBIs into practice requires interaction among three
systems: (1) prevention synthesis and translation systems
that disseminate EBIs (e.g., G uide to Community Preventive
Services), (2) prevention delivery systems that use EBIs to
promote health (e.g., community coalitions, health depart-
ments, community-based organizations), and (3) prevention
support systems that bridge the gap between the two other
systems by disseminating tools and providing training and
technical assistance (TA) to build prevention delivery sys-
tem capacity to effectively use EBIs in practice [8]. Preven-
tion support systems build the organizational capacity of
delivery systems and also build the capacity of public health
practitioners, coalition members, and others working
within those systems. Building on the ISF, Wandersman
and colleagues (2012) proposed a second framework —the
Evidence -Based System for Innovation Support (EBSIS).
The EBSIS describes training, TA, tools, and quality as-
surance/quality improvement as four strategies that sup-
port systems use to build capacity, as well as salient
variations in the way those strategies are structured
according to their dosage, delivery mode, collaborative
design, or proactive design [9].Research has demonstrated that capacity-building in-
terventions can be effective at increasing the adoption
and implementation of EBIs [6, 7, 10], yet little is known
about how best to design capacity building to maximize
its effectiveness. The EBSIS offers a framework for build-
ing the evidence base to guide the design of capacity-
building interventions. The purpose of this review was
to contribute to the further development of the EBSIS
by systematically reviewing empirical studies of capacity-
building interventions to identify (1) the range of strat-
egies used, (2) variations in the way they were struc-
tured, and (3) evidence for their effectiveness at
increasing public health and other community-based
practitioners ’capacity to adopt and implement evidence-
based prevention interventions.
Conceptual framework
We built on the EBSIS to create a conceptual framework
to guide the review (Fig. 1). The framework includes
capacity-building strategies and variations in the ways
strategies are structured (see definitions of strategies and
structures in Table 1.) The framework also describes
intended outcomes (EBI adoption and implementation)
and the mechanisms or mediating variables through
which capacity building is hypothesized to affect those
outcomes (practitioner capacity and EBI planning behav-
iors). Practitioner capacity is defined as the awareness,
knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and motivation to engage
in EBI planning generally and/or to adopt and imple-
ment a specific EBI [6]. Although we recognize the
importance of organization- and system-level capacity,
the focus of the framework and this review is on
practitioner-level capacity. EBI planning behaviors in-
clude collective behaviors such as assessing the commu-
nity, identifying and prioritizing intervention options,
developing an action plan, and evaluating processes and
outcomes [6, 7, 10, 11].
The proposed conceptual framework modifies EBSIS
terminology in three ways to fit the focus of the review.
First, rather than the term “innovations ”, we use the
term “EBIs. ”Both the ISF and EBSIS are used as frame-
works for building capacity to use innovations, which
are not restricted to EBIs and may include any practice
that is new to practitioners. In contrast, the currentLeeman et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:80 Page 2 of 15
review focuses on EBIs, which are defined as programs,
policies, and practices that have been shown to be effect-
ive at improving environments, behaviors, and health
outcomes [1].
Secondly, we use the term “assessment and feedback ”
to refer to the EBSIS strategy “quality assurance/quality
improvement ”because our terminology more clearly de-
scribes a strategy that might be employed in a capacity-
building intervention as opposed to a strategy that might
be employed by the delivery system to monitor and im-
prove the quality of its own performance. Lastly, the
framework also adds a distinction related to the overall
“orientation (push versus pull) ”of capacity building.Within a “push ”orientation, support systems promote a
small number of EBIs and build delivery systems ’cap-
acity to use those EBIs. Within a “pull”orientation, the
support system does not limit its focus to a few EBIs
and instead builds delivery system capacity to select and
use the EBIs that best fit their needs from a menu or
from the universe of available EBIs [12]. Orientation
(push versus pull) is added to the Framework (Fig. 1) as
a variation in the structure of support.
We systematically reviewed tests of interventions to
build practitioners ’capacity to adopt and implement
community-based prevention interventions. The review
addressed the following questions:
Fig. 1 Conceptual framework of capacity-building interventions (adapted from the ISF and EBSIS) [8, 9]
Table 1 Definitions for key capacity-building constructs (adapted from EBSIS) [9]
Constructs Definitions
Strategies
Training Pre-planned educational and/or skill-building sessions typically provided within group settings.
Tools Defined by EBSIS as “informational resources designed to organize, summarize, and/or communicate knowledge. ”We
have revised this definition to include any electronic or print resource that practitioners might use to plan, implement, or
evaluate an intervention.
Technical assistance Interactive support that is individualized to the specific needs of individuals or teams. Those who provide TA may also be
referred to as knowledge brokers, purveyors, linking agents, and external change agents among other terms.
Assessment and
feedbackThe support system ’s strategy of monitoring and providing feedback on delivery system performance (used in place of
the EBSIS term “quality improvement/quality assurance ”)
Structures
Orientation (push
versus pull)Support providers either build delivery system capacity to use a small number of pre-specified EBIs (push) or to use EBIs
selected from a broad number of available EBIs (pull) [ 12].
Dosage Comprises the duration, frequency, and amount of support provided with duration referring to the amount of time from
the start to the end of support provision, frequency referring to how often support was provided during that time, and
amount referring to the cumulative number of hours of support provided.
Delivery Mode The communication channel used to deliver support (e.g., in-person, phone, Internet).
Collaborative design The relationship between support providers and recipients varies in the extent of collaboration with some providers
functioning as advisors while others function as fully engaged participatory partners.
Proactive design TA is both anticipatory and responsive to recipients ’needs with TA providers initiating the process rather than simply
reacting to TA requests.

1. What types of capacity-building strategies are
reported in the literature and how does their
delivery structure vary across capacity-building
interventions?
2. Are capacity-building interventions effective at
improving practitioners ’capacity to use EBIs, their
EBI planning behaviors, and their adoption and
implementation of EBIs?
3. What contextual factors influence the design and
effectiveness of capacity-building interventions?
Methods
Design
A systematic review of the literature was conducted by
representatives of the Cancer Prevention and Control
Research Network, a network of ten centers nationwide
that is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the National Cancer Institute to acceler-
ate the adoption and implementation of EBIs to prevent
and control cancer, in partnership with a wide range of
delivery systems [13]. Thus, members of the review team
had extensive experience building practitioners ’capacity
to use EBIs and were authors of a number of the publi-
cations included in the review.
Search methods
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL for peer-
reviewed, English-language articles reporting the find-
ings of studies of capacity-building interventions with a
focus on interventions to promote public health and
community-based practitioners ’use of prevention EBIs.
The search was limited to articles published between
January 2000 and January 2014 with the goal of assessing
contemporary approaches to capacity building. We de-
fined capacity building as the provision of interactive,
ongoing support for the purpose of increasing practi-
tioners ’ability and motivation to adopt and implement
EBIs [6]. Community-based prevention EBIs were de-
fined as EBIs that focused on primary prevention in a
non-clinical context. In addition to the term “capacity
building, ”the search included terms commonly used to
refer to ongoing interaction between support providers
and recipients: “technical assistance ”OR “knowledge
transfer ”OR “knowledge broker ”OR “linking agent ”.
These terms were combined with the following: “com-
munity-based ”OR “health promotion ”OR “prevent* ”
OR“public health. ”The search string also was designed
to identify intervention studies and to exclude studies
conducted in low and middle income countries because
limitations in their financing, infrastructure, and infor-
mation systems require distinct approaches to capacity
building that fall outside the scope of this review [14].
The complete string of terms used to search PubMed is
detailed in Fig. 2. Searching for literature in this area isdifficult because the vocabulary has yet to be standard-
ized [15]. To be more comprehensive, we also solicited
recommendations from members of the Cancer Preven-
tion and Control Research Network.
Two members of the research team reviewed the title
and, as needed, the abstracts and full articles of identi-
fied publications. Articles were included if they were em-
pirical studies of the provision of capacity-building
interventions to promote the use of primary prevention
EBIs in non-clinical settings. Capacity building had to be
interactive and ongoing; thus, studies were excluded if
they included only training or the online dissemination
of information. We also excluded studies conducted in a
single site, reports of “lessons learned ”that lacked a de-
scription of the methods for collecting and analyzing
data, and studies that only reported findings related to
changes in population health behaviors/health status
and did not include findings related to capacity, adop-
tion, or implementation. To maximize the amount of
data included in the review, we did not exclude studies
a priori based on their design or quality. Instead, the
following factors that contribute to validity were iden-
tified during abstraction: study design, sample size
(practitioners and settings) , data collection methods,
and other factors (e.g., response rates). Potential
threats to validity were t aken into account in the re-
port of synthesis findings [16].
Data abstraction and synthesis
The findings from reports on capacity building are not
amenable to meta-analysis due to their methodological
and conceptual diversity. Therefore, quantitative (vote
counting) [16] and qualitative (meta-summary) methods
were used to summarize and synthesize both qualitative
and quantitative findings [17]. Two reviewers independ-
ently abstracted the following information from each art-
icle: study characteristics (location, settings, participants,
methods); focus of capacity building (EBIs, population
behavior targeted); strategies and structure of capacity
building (coded using Table 1 constructs); outcomes
related to practitioners ’capacity (knowledge, skills,
attitude, or beliefs) or intervention planning behaviors;
outcomes related to setting/sector-level adoption and
implementation of EBIs; and any qualitative findings re-
lated to variations in context and/or the structure of
capacity-building strategies. To appraise potential threats
to validity, the following data also were abstracted: de-
sign, sample size, and response rates [18]. The lead au-
thor trained all nine reviewers, who completed a pilot
abstraction prior to participating in the review. The two
reviewers for each publication compared their abstrac-
tions and resolved discrepancies by consensus.
Findings were then summarized and synthesized. The
Table 1 codes were iteratively revised to capture theLeeman et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:80 Page 4 of 15
information derived from the review [19]. Vote counting
methods were used to summarize data on the type and
structure of capacity-building strategies and their effects
on practitioner- and setting-level outcomes [16]. For
findings on effectiveness, potential threats to validity
were described as they related to each category of cumu-
lative findings. Two authors applied meta-summary
methods to iteratively review, summarize, and integrate
qualitative findings into themes related to context and to
variations in capacity-building strategies [17]. Once data
were summarized and synthesized, findings were pre-
sented back to the full group of abstractors to ensure
agreement.
Results
The initial search yielded 1437 publications of which 42
publications reporting the findings from 29 studies met
inclusion criteria (see Fig. 3 for PRISMA diagram).
Table 2 provides an overview of the included studies.One study was conducted in Sweden and the remainder
in the United States. A variety of frameworks and theor-
ies informed the studies included in the review. The
three most frequently cited were the Diffusion of Inno-
vations Theory (eight studies), the Interactive Systems
Framework (seven studies), and Getting to Outcomes or
Assets Getting to Outcomes (five studies). Others that
were cited more than once included Social Cognitive
Theory (three studies), Empowerment Evaluation (two
studies), and Communities that Care (two studies).
The most common settings for capacity-building inter-
ventions were communities (including those done with
community-based coalitions; ten studies), schools (ten
studies), and community-based organizations (five stud-
ies). Other settings included worksites, churches, pools,
health departments, AIDs service organizations, and
club houses for the mentally ill. The most frequently
targeted behaviors included drinking and substance
abuse (nine studies), sun exposure and youth problem(“capacity building” OR “technical assistance” OR “kno wledge transfer” OR “knowledge broker” OR “knowledge 
brokers”) AND (prevent* OR “health promotion” OR commun ity OR “public health”) AND (evaluat* OR trial* OR

Study designs included 12 group randomized trials, 4 group
non-randomized trials, 8 single group before-after studies,
and 5 case studies that reported no pre-test or comparison
group data.
Review findings are organized in response to the
study ’s research questions.
What types of capacity-building strategies are reported in
the literature?
The literature review confirmed that the EBSIS frame-
work captured most of the strategies that were used to
build practitioners ’capacity (see Additional file 1: Table
S1). All 29 studies included TAas one of the capacity-
building strategies. In the majority of studies, capacity
building also included training (n= 27) and tools (n=
25). Among the tools described were manuals designed
to guide practitioners in conducting an overall planning
process (e.g., Chinman et al., [20]) or delivering a specific
intervention (e.g., Harshbarger et al., [21]), e-newsletters
(e.g., Beam et al., [22]; [23]), in tervention materials (e.g.,
Glanz et al., [24]), evaluation tools (e.g., Emmons et al.,
[25]), and site-specific wri tten recommendations (e.g.,
Hannon et al., [26]). Only three interventions included as-
sessment and feedback ; in each of these studies, capacity
building included monitoring a nd feedback on the fidelity
of EBI implementation [27 –29].
The review identified two capacity-building strategies
not described by the EBSIS: opportunities for peer net-
working and incentives. Opportunities for peer network-
ingincluded bringing practitioners together to learn
from each other via in-person trainings and TA sessions
[28, 30 –32], interactive conference calls [33], and web-
based discussion forums [34]. Many of the capacity-
building interventions provided incentives to motivate
practitioners to participate in the capacity-building inter-
vention or to adopt and implement EBIs, such as schol-
arships to participate in trainings [31], mandating
participation in training as a requirement for funding
[35], or provision of free resources (e.g., sunscreen to
pool staff) [24].
How does delivery structure vary across capacity-building
interventions?
The way that capacity building was structured varied
across the dimensions detailed in the EBSIS: orientation,
dosage, delivery mode, and collaborative and proactive
design (see Additional file 1: Table S1). In ten of the
studies, the intervention orientation was towards “push-
ing”one or two specific EBIs (e.g., Pool Cool, VOICES/
VOCES). In the remaining 19 studies, capacity building
was oriented towards building practitioners ’capacity to
“pull”EBIs from a wider range of options. Dosage variedwidely, with authors often providing only limited infor-
mation. In 19 of the studies, authors provided informa-
tion on training dosage, typically in the format of
number of trainings and their duration (e.g., 1 day). Au-
thors provided almost no information on TA dosage in
15 studies. Authors did provide data on TA frequency
(e.g., bi-weekly [29]) but not overall amount in three
studies, overall amount of TA provided but not fre-
quency (e.g., average of 76.2 h of TA per organization
[31]) in five studies, and data on both the frequency and
amount of TA provided in six studies. In some studies,
authors provided overall exposure scores that combined
dosage of training and TA with use of tools (e.g., Chin-
man et al., [20]). Authors also reported the mode
through which TA was delivered, via face-to-face, by
phone, or through combination of those media and
email.
The collaborative design of capacity-building interven-
tions also varied. The review revealed multiple related
dimensions across which variation occurred in the col-
laborations between those providing and those receiving
the capacity-building intervention. Those providing the
intervention may work directly with delivery systems or
may use a two-level or train-the-trainer model to build
the capacity of intermediaries (e.g., field coordinators
[24] or TA providers [36]) who then build the capacity
of delivery systems. Capacity building also varied in
whether it was provided to those who were planning or
overseeing EBI implementation (e.g., members of a coali-
tion [27]) versus those who actually delivered the EBI
(e.g., teachers delivering a substance abuse intervention
[34]). In most interventions, TA was provided proactively .
The review identified an additional dimension of vari-
ation in the structure of capacity building not specified
by EBSIS. Capacity-building interventions varied in
whether or not they were delivered within the context of
an overall planning model (e.g., Getting to Outcomes).
Planning models walk delivery systems through an over-
all planning process that includes stages such as asses-
sing the context, selecting an EBI, implementing the
EBI, and evaluating processes and outcomes. The most
commonly used planning models were variations on
Getting to Outcomes ( n= 5 studies) [20, 28, 37, 38], Com-
munities that Care ( n= 2 studies) [27, 39], and one study
each using PROSPER [36], the Healthy Schools Program
[22], STAR [30], the Strategic Prevention Framework [32],
and a locally developed logic model [40].
Are capacity-building interventions effective at improving
practitioners ’capacity to use EBIs, their EBI planning
behaviors, and their adoption and implementation of EBIs?
As summarized in Table 3, studies were more likely to
report findings related to effects on adoption ( n= 12) or
implementation ( n= 11) than they were to report theLeeman et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:80 Page 9 of 15
effect that capacity building had on practitioners ’cap-
acity ( n= 7) or planning behaviors ( n= 7) (see Add-
itional file 2: Table S2 for a more detailed breakdown of
findings for each study).
Effects on practitioners ’capacity to use EBIs
In the seven studies reporting findings related to inter-
vention effects on capacity, findings were mixed. Studies
reported response rates of 75% or better and had sample
sizes of 120 or more, with the exception of Florin et al.
(n= 9, [32]) and Little et al. ( n= 50, [41]). Researchers
operationalized capacity as self-efficacy (or self-report of
skills), awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and/or beliefs
about the value of the EBI. In two cases, group random-
ized trials found significantly greater improvements in
capacity in the intervention versus the comparison
group (self-efficacy [41] and knowledge [42]) and in two
they did not (self-efficacy [43] and beliefs [41]). Neither
of the two group non-randomized trials found significant
between group differences in capacity (awareness [44]
and self-efficacy and attitude [20]) following the inter-
vention. Two studies found significant within group
increases in capacity (awareness, skills [44] and self-
efficacy [32]).
In one study, researchers analyzed the role that cap-
acity played as both a mediator and moderator of cap-
acity building ’s effects on implementation [41]. They
found that changes in practitioners ’self-efficacy (but not
in their beliefs) mediated the effects that training and
TA had on implementation fidelity. They also found that
beliefs about an EBI ’s value moderated the effects of
Training/TA on EBI implementation fidelity, with Train-
ing/TA more effective for those practitioners who had
more favorable beliefs at baseline.
Effects on EBI planning behaviors
The review found mixed evidence for the effects that in-
terventions had on practitioners ’collective EBI planning
behaviors (see Table 3). Behaviors included, for example,
developing an implementation plan and evaluatingprocesses and outcomes [38]. Seven studies assessed
planning behaviors. The unit of analysis for assessing be-
haviors was at the level of the setting (e.g., community,
program, or school) and sample sizes ranged from 6 to
134. The three studies with the largest sample sizes tested
for effectiveness. Of those, two group trials found signifi-
cant differences, one randomized ( n= 24, [30]) and one not
(n=1 3 4 ,s c h o o l s[ 4 5 ] ) ;a n do n eg r o u pr a n d o m i z e dt r i a l
found no significant differences in improvement between
groups ( n= 30 programs, [43]). In four studies, authors de-
scribed improvements in planning behaviors without
reporting significance [20, 31, 38, 46].
Effects on adoption and implementation
The review found evidence that capacity building affects
delivery system adoption and implementation of EBIs
(Additional file 2: Table S2). Of the 12 studies that
assessed adoption , four found a significant within group
difference [22, 24, 26, 40] and two found significant be-
tween group differences in adoption rates with the inter-
vention group having higher rates than the comparison
[39, 47]; four additional studies found an increase in
adoption following the capacity-building intervention
without testing for significance [21, 25, 46, 48]. Findings
were mixed, however, as four studies found non-
significant group differences in adoption rates [24, 26,
44, 49]. Of the 11 studies that assessed effects on the ex-
tent or fidelity of implementation , all but one reported
that capacity building had a positive effect. In five group
trials (four of which were randomized), researchers com-
pared differences between groups and found that the
intervention group had better implementation outcomes
than the comparison. In one of the five trials, findings
were mixed and the intervention group performed sig-
nificantly better on only some of the outcomes [39].
Findings on the effects that variations in strategy type
and structure have on outcomes
Review findings suggest that both the type and structure
of prevention support strategies influence outcomes. InTable 3 Summary findings on effectiveness

four studies, researchers compared the effectiveness of
different combinations of prevention support strategies
and found that interventions that provide TA in addition
to training and tools have a greater impact on adoption
and implementation [24, 33, 48, 50] than those that do
not. In six of eight studies that assessed the relationship
between dosage and outcomes, researchers found that dos-
age is related to the effect of prevention support on capacity
[20, 43], planning behaviors [ 20, 43], adoption [22, 23], and
implementation [32, 33, 50], such that higher dose or more
engagement with the capacity- building intervention was as-
sociated with greater improvem ents in capacity, behaviors,
adoption, and/or implementation (Additional file 2: Table
S2). Riggs et al. [30] did not find a significant relationship
between capacity-building dos e and coalition capacity [30],
and Spoth et al. [36] found no si gnificant relationship be-
tween frequency of TA requests and the quality of planning
behaviors or fidelity o f implementation [36].
What contextual factors influence the design and
effectiveness of capacity-building interventions?
The review identified evidence on the following factors
that may influence the types and structure of capacity-
building strategies that will be most effective: setting
capacity, attributes of the EBI, EBI fit with the setting,
and the stage of the intervention planning process. In six
studies, authors reported that setting -level capacity
played an important role in determining the effects that
capacity-building interventions have on adoption and
implementation. Setting-level capacity included re-
sources (e.g., time, staff, computers, funding, leadership)
[20, 31, 41, 48] and collective attitude or willingness
[28]. In prevention interventions, the “setting ”may be
the community, with a community coalition taking thelead in adopting and implementing EBIs as was the case
in Brown et al. [27], which found that the quality of a
coalition ’s functioning (e.g., funding, leadership, internal
and external relationships) was associated positively with
the number of EBIs a coalition supported and their ef-
forts to maintain implementation fidelity [27]. In a sev-
enth study, Nargiso et al. [51] found that settings with
lower initial capacity utilized more training and TA [51].
In two studies, authors suggested that EBIs with more
components and less prescriptive implementation guid-
ance are more difficult or require more effort to support
than other EBIs [28, 32]. Study investigators also re-
ported on the challenges created when EBIs did not fita
particular setting ’s funding streams, values, or their cli-
ents’cultures [26, 48]. Multiple studies reported differ-
ences in the types and/or amounts of prevention
support required at different stages in the intervention
planning process (e.g., Chinman et al. [20]).
Discussion
Wandersman et al. [9] created the EBSIS as a framework
to guide creation of an evidence base for capacity-
building interventions [9]. To further advance the sci-
ence of improving practitioners ’capacity, we have used
an adapted EBSIS framework to guide a systematic re-
view of the capacity-building literature. The findings
from our review confirm the usefulness of EBSIS con-
structs and identify further refinements. Figure 4 pre-
sents the refined framework, which includes two new
capacity-building strategies (peer networking and incen-
tives) and two additional ways that the structure of those
strategies differs across studies (intended recipients and
whether provided within the context of a planning
model). The review also provides details on the different
Fig. 4 Revised framework for capacity-building interventionsLeeman et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:80 Page 11 of 15
types of tools being used to build practitioners ’capaci-
ty—a strategy that is only minimally described in the
EBSIS framework. Lastly, the refined framework includes
the review ’s exploratory findings related to contextual
factors that may moderate the effectiveness of capacity-
building interventions and need to be considered in their
design. These factors include setting capacity, attributes
of the EBI, EBI/setting fit, and stage of the intervention
planning process.
Similar to prior reviews, we found that capacity-
building interventions can be effective at increasing EBI
adoption and implementation [6, 7, 10]. These effective-
ness findings are based on vote counting rather than
meta-analysis and therefore should be interpreted with
caution [52]. The review found that only seven of the 29
studies tested the effects that interventions had on cap-
acity and only one assessed its role as mediator of an in-
tervention ’s effects on implementation. EBSIS posits that
capacity is the primary mechanism through which pre-
vention support affects the adoption and implementa-
tion of EBIs, and yet findings on interventions ’effects
on capacity were mixed, with non-significant effects in
three of the five studies that compared outcomes in the
intervention group to a compar ison group. Non-significant
findings could have resulted from either limitations in the
interventions or in the measurement of effects. Additional
research focusing on identifying the capacities required to
adopt and to implement EBIs and developing measures that
are sensitive to change in those capacities will advance the
science of capacity building. L imited evidence exists to sup-
port interventions ’effectiveness at improving practitioners ’
intervention planning behaviors. Capacity was assessed at
the level of individual practi tioners, whereas planning be-
haviors were assessed at the or ganizational or coalition
level, resulting in sample sizes that were often too small to
assess for statistically significant change.
One of the review ’s central purposes was to describe
capacity-building strategies and synthesize evidence re-
lated to variations in their types and structures. The lack
of information that authors provided about their
capacity-building strategies and the way they were struc-
tured make it difficult to transfer successful strategies to
new settings or to develop guidance for how best to
structure capacity building. The need for specific guid-
ance on how to structure capacity building is evidenced
by findings that TA providers often experience their role
as vague and ill-defined [53]. The lack of information re-
lated to capacity-building strategy types and structures
also limits the potential to synthesize findings across
studies. Use of standardized reporting such as CON-
SORT, TREND, or TIDieR may help practitioners or re-
searchers disseminating results of interventions to
include all relevant elements and ensure that reviewers
can find more detailed information about interventioncomponents [54, 55]. Synthesis is further constrained by
the limited use of theory in the design and testing of
capacity-building interventions.
Limitations
The review of the literature was systematic but not com-
prehensive. Searches for literature related to implemen-
tation science are difficult because the field is still in the
early stages of development, and consistent terminology
has not been adopted [15, 56]. Because of these chal-
lenges, we cannot claim to have identified all reports of
community-based interventions to build practitioners ’
capacity to adopt and implement primary prevention
EBIs. Of particular concern is the limited number of
studies identified in countries other than the United
States. The fact that a number of the reviewers were also
authors on studies included in the review may have con-
tributed to a biased conceptualization of what consti-
tutes “capacity building. ”However, having two individual
abstract data from each article limited the potential for
bias in data abstractions. The review ’s findings were fur-
ther limited by weaknesses in the included studies ’
methods. Although 12 of the 29 studies were group ran-
domized trials, small sample sizes limited the potential
to identify significant differences between groups and
the remaining studies employed weaker designs. In many
of the publications, authors provided only limited detail
on their interventions. Although this is similar to other
types of intervention research where authors often in-
clude little detail on the dosage or mode of delivery [57],
it limits analyses.
Implications for future research
The EBSIS and our refined framework both move the
field towards a more standardized approach to concep-
tualizing the types and structures of capacity-building
strategies. This standardization will assist in synthesizing
findings across studies and building the evidence base
for what works under which circumstances. However,
for findings to contribute to the evidence base, it is es-
sential that researchers provide complete descriptions of
how they designed and delivered their capacity-building
interventions. Capacity building is a complex, behavioral
change intervention. The prevention support field could
benefit from guidance that the United Kingdom ’s Med-
ical Research Council and others have developed to fa-
cilitate the development, testing, and translation of
complex interventions [58, 59]. Of greatest relevance to
the present discussion are recommendations that re-
searchers identify and evaluate the theory of change and
provide detailed descriptions of the intervention “to en-
able replication, evidence synthesis, and wider imple-
mentation ”(p. 2) [58].Leeman et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:80 Page 12 of 15
EBSIS and the refined framework could also advance
the field towards the development of theory. Since cap-
acity is hypothesized as the primary causal mechanism,
further research is needed to better understand the cap-
acities that practitioners require to successfully adopt
and implement EBIs and to develop measures of those
capacities. Additional research is also needed to identify
salient contextual factors that moderate the effects of
prevention support and the best approaches to custom-
izing prevention support contingent on those factors.
The framework ’s depiction of prevention support as a
linear process is an oversimplification, and more re-
search is needed to understand bi-directional interac-
tions between support providers and practitioners and
their effects.
Conclusion
The number of researchers and agencies providing tech-
nical assistance and other capacity-building strategies to
promote the use of evidence in practice is on the rise.
However, the science to guide the design of prevention
support is nascent. Only a limited number of researchers
have taken a rigorous approach to designing, describing,
and testing capacity-building strategies. As a result, little
is known about how capacity-building strategies may
vary across projects and how those variations may affect
outcomes. This review contributes to the understanding
of the types of capacity-building strategies and their ef-
fects thereby building the knowledge base on how to
build practitioners ’capacity to use EBIs.
