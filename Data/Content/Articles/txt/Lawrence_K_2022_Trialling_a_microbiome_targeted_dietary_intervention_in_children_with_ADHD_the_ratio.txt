Abstract 
Background: Dietary interventions have been previously explored in children with ADHD. Elimination diets and 
supplementation can produce beneficial behaviour changes, but little is known about the mechanisms mediating 
change. We propose that these interventions may work, in part, by causing changes in the gut microbiota. A microbi‑
ome ‑targeted dietary intervention was developed, and its feasibility assessed.
Methods: A non‑randomised feasibility study was conducted on nine non‑medicated children with ADHD, aged 
8–13 years (mean 10.39 years), using a prospective one ‑group pre ‑test/post ‑test design. Participants were recruited 
from ADHD support groups in London and took part in the 6‑ week microbiome ‑targeted dietary intervention, which 
was specifically designed to impact the composition of gut bacteria. Children were assessed pre ‑ and post ‑interven‑
tion on measures of ADHD symptomatology, cognition, sleep, gut function and stool‑sample microbiome analysis. 
The primary aim was to assess the study completion rate, with secondary aims assessing adherence, adverse events 
(aiming for no severe and minimal), acceptability and suitability of outcome measures.
Results: Recruitment proved to be challenging and despite targeting 230 participants directly through support 
groups, and many more through social media, nine families (of the planned 10) signed up for the trial. The completion 
rate for the study was excellent at 100%. Exploration of secondary aims revealed that (1) adherence to each aspect 
of the dietary protocol was very good; (2) two mild adverse events were reported; (3) parents rated the treatment as 
having good acceptability; (4) data collection and outcome measures were broadly feasible for use in an RCT with a 
few suggestions recommended; (5) descriptive data for outcome measures is presented and suggests that further 
exploration of gut microbiota, ADHD symptoms and sleep would be helpful in future research.
Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility of a microbiome ‑targeted dietary interven‑
tion in children with ADHD. Recruitment was challenging, but the diet itself was well‑tolerated and adherence was 
very good. Families wishing to trial this diet may find it an acceptable intervention. However, recruitment, even for this 
small pilot study, was challenging. Because of the difficulty experienced recruiting participants, future randomised 
controlled trials may wish to adopt a simpler dietary approach which requires less parental time and engagement, in 
order to recruit the number of participants required to make meaningful statistical interpretations of efficacy.

Key messages regarding feasibility
1) What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibility?
Would we be able to recruit families to be involved in 
the study? Would participants be able to complete the 
6-week dietary intervention? What would adherence 
rates be to each aspect of the dietary protocol? Would 
there be any adverse events? Would the treatment be 
acceptable to parents? Would data collection and out -
come measures be appropriate for use in an RCT?
2) What are the key feasibility findings?
The diet itself was a feasible intervention for those 
who took part. The completion rate was 100%, with good 
levels of adherence and acceptability. Two mild adverse 
events were reported. The intervention had high levels 
of acceptability, adherence and completion. However, 
recruitment was very challenging meaning running an 
adequately powered RCT using this exact protocol is 
probably unfeasible.
3) What are the implications of the feasibility findings 
for the design of the main study?
Outcome measures were evaluated for their use in 
a larger trial and some recommendations suggested. 
Recruitment was challenging and it is suggested that a 
future larger-scale study may benefit from using a dietary 
intervention that requires less parental time and input, in 
order to recruit an adequate number of participants.
Background
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder, defined by its behav -
ioural symptoms of impulsivity, hyperactivity and 
inattention [1 ]. Prevalence rates are estimated to be 
rising with global, community prevalence in children 
estimated to be around 5% [2 ]. The main therapeu -
tic options for children with ADHD are behavioural 
therapy, parent training and medication. Accord -
ing to some estimates, around two-thirds of children 
diagnosed with ADHD in the USA are on medication 
for their condition [3 , 4], with prescriptions of Ritalin (Methylphenidate) increasing considerably over recent 
decades [5 ]. However, Methylphenidate does not always 
result in substantial symptom reduction and does not 
appear to reduce school drop-out rates or unemploy -
ment [6 ]. Furthermore, a number of debilitating side 
effects (such as anxiety, stomach ache, nausea, head -
aches and sleep problems) are experienced by a sig -
nificant proportion of children taking Methylphenidate 
[7]. These, coupled with the long-term effects of stimu -
lants on growth [8 ], have led parents to seek alternative 
treatments for their children that may have fewer side 
effects [9 ].
Parents keen to investigate non-pharmaceutical treat -
ments are often drawn to considering dietary interven -
tions. The main dietary interventions that have been 
explored in ADHD can be grouped into three broad cat -
egories: exclusion of food additives; essential fatty acid 
supplementation; and elimination diets. Stimulated by 
the early theoretical ideas of Feingold [10], numerous, 
predominantly small-scale, studies have explored the 
efficacy of excluding food additives, artificial colourings 
and flavourings, from the diet of children with ADHD 
[11, 12]. Meta-analyses report a significant, though mod -
est, benefit of the exclusion of food additives on symp -
toms of ADHD [13, 14] although the results do not 
always remain significant when corrected for publication 
bias [13]. There has been widespread interest regarding 
the potential benefits of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFAs) supplementation for individuals diagnosed 
with ADHD. Recent reviews suggest that approximately 
50% of studies demonstrate a beneficial effect of PUFAs 
on ADHD symptoms with evidence overall remaining 
inconclusive [15, 16]. The Few Foods Diet is an elimina -
tion diet which excludes many commonly eaten foods, 
including those most likely to provoke sensitivities (such 
as gluten, dairy and citrus fruits). The ‘Few Foods Diet’ 
(sometimes referred to as an oligoantigenic diet) includes 
a highly restricted number of permitted foods (for exam -
ple a diet that focuses exclusively on lamb, chicken, pota -
toes, rice, banana, apple and brassica) [17]. This diet can 
be highly effective at reducing symptoms in children with 
ADHD [17–20], evidenced by considerably larger effect 
sizes than alternative dietary treatments [16]. However, 
little is understood about the mechanisms underlying its 
success and its highly restrictive nature means it is rela -
tively difficult to implement and adhere to.Trial registration: Clini calTr  ials. gov Identifier: NCT03 737877. Registered 13 November 2018—retrospectively regis‑

Knowledge of the mechanisms by which these differ -
ent dietary interventions may operate has not been fully 
established. We suggest that one means by which they 
may exert a behavioural change in children with ADHD 
is by manipulating the diversity and species of microor -
ganisms residing within the gut. Ample evidence from 
both human and animal studies describes the impact 
of dietary interventions on the idiosyncrasies of the gut 
microbiota, the tens of trillions of microorganisms [21, 
22] that inhabit our gastrointestinal system [23, 24]. 
Every unique community of microorganisms interacts 
with their human host through immune, neuroendocrine 
and neural pathways [25].
Research has shown that gut microbiota can have a pro -
found impact on health [26–28], including mental health 
[29–32], potentially via its role in the gut-brain axis. The 
microbiome and the gut-brain axis have been implicated 
to play a role in many of the symptoms and characteris -
tics which are commonly observed in individuals with 
ADHD, including anomalies with cognition [33–36], 
emotion [37, 38], anxiety [39] and sleep [40]. In addition, 
a number of risk factors associated with an increased 
prevalence in ADHD, including being born by cesarean 
[41], a lack of breastfeeding [42, 43] and maternal stress 
[44], are known to have a negative impact on the estab -
lishment of a healthy microbiome [45, 46]. The health of 
the microbiome has not been fully explored in children 
with ADHD, but there is some preliminary evidence to 
suggest that there may be some differences in the species 
of bacteria present in comparison to individuals with -
out ADHD [47, 48], although the results are variable and 
the picture still rather unclear [49]. There are numerous 
plausible mechanisms for the way in which gut bacte -
ria may influence the behavioural symptoms of children 
with ADHD. Microbiota have been reported to influence 
inflammation, the production of hormones (including the 
stress hormone, cortisol), neurotransmitters (such as ser -
otonin) together with the development and function of 
brain structures such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex 
and hippocampus, all of which could plausibly play a role 
in the development of ADHD [50–54].
Research has shown that gut bacteria can be manipu -
lated in a matter of days by alterations to diet [55–
57]. Therefore, the dietary interventions previously 
researched in ADHD may have exerted their effect, in 
part, by producing alterations in the microbiota. Look -
ing specifically at the type of dietary interventions that 
have been trialled in children with ADHD, the con -
sumption of artificial food additives has been linked to 
various shifts in microbiome communities [58, 59] with 
increasing evidence to suggest that artificial sweeten -
ers and food additives may be linked to dysbiosis [59, 
60]. Along with the role Omega 3 PUFAs have a role in decreasing inflammation [61] they can also be considered 
to be a type of prebiotic [62] and may exert a positive 
influence on the composition of the gut microbiota and 
consequently the gut-brain axis [62–64]. Finally, adopt -
ing a Few Foods diet would likely have a marked impact 
on microbiota composition; however, this is yet to be 
explored. The consumption of ultra-processed foods and 
high sugar diets have been linked to the proliferation of 
microbes that promote inflammatory disease [65, 66] 
and thus the removal of these foods may enhance the gut 
microbiota.
Whilst the dietary interventions explored in ADHD 
have the potential to improve the composition of the 
microbiota, to the best of our knowledge, none explic -
itly state that they were designed with this goal in mind. 
Diet can have a profound influence on the composition 
of gut bacteria and numerous studies attest to the poten -
tial benefit of specific microbiota targeted dietary inter -
ventions. Diets containing a rich diversity of plant fibre 
and polyphenols, provide fuel for the commensal bacte -
ria in the gut and may also increase microbial diversity 
[67, 68] with the greater number of plant varieties con -
sumed associated with greater microbial diversity [69]. 
Time-restricted eating can also enhance the diversity of 
the gut microbiome [70–72] and consuming fermented 
food, rich in probiotics, such as kefir, can produce an 
increase in beneficial gut bacteria such as Lactobacillus 
[73]. Nutritional education focusing on improving gut 
microbiota composition has been found to be associated 
with increased microbial diversity and improvements in 
physical and mental health in adult women [74]. Such an 
approach has not been trailed in ADHD but preliminary 
research trialling probiotics in this population suggests 
a potential benefit of microbiome targeted interventions 
[75, 76].
In this study, we propose a dietary intervention devel -
oped specifically for the purpose of targeting the gut 
microbiota and improving the microbial balance. From 
a behaviour change perspective, individuals typically 
find it easier to introduce new behaviours into their daily 
lives than they do to remove existing behaviours: hab -
its become rather automatic, meaning breaking existing 
habits is more effortful and difficult than establishing 
new habits [77, 78]. This may be especially true for chil -
dren with ADHD for whom difficulties with impulse con -
trol and behavioural inhibition are core symptoms of the 
disorder [79]. The dietary approach devised for the cur -
rent study therefore centres largely on the introduction 
of positive changes in dietary behaviours, rather than the 
direct removal of existing behaviours.
The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the 
dietary intervention in order to support the development 
of a future randomised controlled trial (RCT). The study 
Page 4 of 15 Lawrence et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:108 
is reported in adherence to the CONSORT extension to 
pilot and feasibility studies [80, 81], and as such, there 
was no formal hypothesis testing using inferential statis -
tics on the outcome measures [82]. The primary aim of 
the current study was to assess the feasibility of the die -
tary intervention in terms of the proportion of those who 
completed the dietary intervention. There were a number 
of secondary aims: (1) to assess percentage adherence 
to each aspect of the dietary protocol, (2) to record any 
adverse events, (3) to assess parent-rated acceptability 
of the treatment, (4) to evaluate data collection and out -
come measures to assess their feasibility for use in an 
RCT, and (5) to explore the change in outcome measures 
for preliminary evidence of potential effects.
Materials and methods
Study design
This was a 6-week pilot feasibility study to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and compliance of a dietary inter -
vention for children with ADHD. The feasibility study 
used a single-arm, pre-test/post-test design. This design 
was well suited to our study, which was investigating a 
new and innovative dietary intervention for which little 
information existed on the feasibility of the programme 
and the ability to carry out a large-scale trial. This 
trial was registered with Clini calTr  ials. gov (Identifier: 
NCT03737877). Primary and secondary outcomes were 
measured through information collected throughout 
and at completion (week six) of the dietary intervention. 
Ethical approval for the study was granted by St Mary’s 
University Ethics Committee (SMEC_2017-18_132) and 
parents and children were provided with full written 
information about the study before written consent and 
assent were obtained. Participants completed baseline 
assessments at Time 1, prior to commencing the dietary 
intervention, and at Time 2, during week 6 of the diet.
Participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Children were eligible to take part in the study if they had 
received a diagnosis of ADHD by a specialist qualified 
healthcare professional and were aged between 8 years 
and 13 years at the onset of study. The lower limit was 
set at 8 years, as this is the youngest age at which self-
report data can be gathered using the Conners Compre -
hensive Behavior Rating Scales [83] to measure ADHD 
symptomatology. An upper limit was set at 13 years as 
it was thought that parents would have less control of 
their child’s diet above this age which may impact adher -
ence. Parental commitment to attending group sessions 
was also required. Males and females, children with co-
occurring diagnoses and those with food allergies or sen -
sitivities could take part in the study. Comorbidity is an epidemiological reality for many children with ADHD 
[84], and therefore, including such children allows us to 
represent the reality of an ADHD diagnosis. We were 
also primarily concerned about assessing the feasibility of 
following the diet rather than outcome measures.
Participants were not eligible to take part if they (1) 
were currently taking ADHD medication (such as Meth -
ylphenidate); (2) were currently undergoing a course of 
behavioural therapy; and (3) had taken antibiotics in the 
past 3 months. Group sessions and data collection took 
place at a clinical setting in London, UK.
Sample recruitment
Participants were recruited through convenience sam -
pling via information and flyers distributed by ADHD 
support groups in London, online support groups and 
social media. The intention was to include the first 10 
participants who were interested in taking part and eli -
gible to do so. It was deemed to be important, from an 
ethical perspective, that this diet was trialled on a small 
number of participants to assess feasibility before a 
larger-scale RCT was conducted.
Sample size
The first nine participants who were interested in the 
study and eligible to take part (6 male; 3 female) were 
enrolled in the study. Participants ranged from 8 to 13 
years at the commencement of the trial, with a mean age 
of 10.39 years (SD 1.67).
Dietary intervention
With guidance from a Registered Nutritional Therapist, 
we developed a microbiome-targeted dietary interven -
tion specifically for this study. This is based on five action 
points which are described in Table  1 and were followed 
by participants for 6 weeks.
Parents attended four group sessions to receive infor -
mation about the diet and on-going support and to 
provide data about their children: a 2-h session before 
commencing the diet; a 1-h session at the end of weeks 
two and four and a 2-h session at the end of week six. The 
sessions were delivered by a practising registered nutri -
tional therapist, at a medical centre in London. At ses -
sions one and two, 24-h retrospective dietary recalls were 
recorded and discussed to allow the nutritional therapist 
to tailor advice to the needs of the participants. Partici -
pants were provided with information about the dietary 
principles, including general recipe ideas to apply these 
five principles and given food demonstrations and sam -
ple tastings. Individualised recommendations were made 
depending on children’s specific needs, e.g. food intoler -
ances, reluctance to try new foods etc. Ongoing support

 Lawrence et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:108 
 
was provided throughout the study by use of a closed 
WhatsApp group and via email contact.
Kefir drinks were distributed to participants every 2 
weeks throughout the 6-week study. Participants were 
asked to consume 125 ml of kefir every day for the dura -
tion of the study, which could be taken on its own, with 
food or combined into a smoothie. Nourish Kefir supplied 
organic cow’s milk kefir for the study free of charge. The 
kefir is estimated to contain approximately 50 billion live 
microorganisms in a 125-ml serving. Species of micro-
organisms vary due to fermentation but typically include 
Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, 
Saccharomyces cerevisae and the exopolysaccharide 
kefiran.
One child, who was unable to tolerate dairy, was pro -
vided with a coconut kefir drink. Life shot 100 billion high 
potency coconut kefir (40 ml) was mixed with Coconut 
kefir Mango & Passion (125 ml), prepared by Rhythm 
Health’s vegan water kefir cultures, containing a mixed 
culture of lactic acid bacteria including Lactobacillus aci -
dophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamno -
sus, Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The 
product was supplied at a reduced cost for the trial by 
Rhythm Health. This dairy-free alternative had a bacterial 
count of an estimated 50 billion live bacteria per day.
Assessments
Primary outcome
The primary outcome measure was the completion of the 
study, measured as the number of participants who com -
pleted the trial.
Adherence to diet
Adherence to diet was measured through parental com -
pletion of a daily paper diary indicating the aspects of the 
diet that their child complied with. This was measured as percentage adherence to each of the five aspects of 
the diet over the 6-week period. The potential range was 
0–100%, with a higher score reflecting a greater degree 
of adherence. Perceived ease and difficulty of adherence 
to each aspect of the diet was also assessed via an end 
of study online questionnaire distributed through Jisc 
Online Surveys (Jisc, Bristol, UK). Parents were asked to 
indicate how easy/difficult was to adhere to each aspect 
of the diet measured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1= 
very easy to 5=very difficult.
Adverse events
Adverse events were recorded according to the Com -
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [92] and 
European Commission guidelines [93] throughout the 
duration of the study. Parents were asked to report any 
adverse events immediately to the researchers and were 
additionally prompted at each session to recall any 
adverse events.
Treatment acceptability scale
Parents completed a short Treatment Acceptability 
Scale [94] which consisted of six questions which were 
responded to on a 7 point Likert scale from 1 to 7. Items 
include, ‘how effective do you think this treatment might 
be?’ Item 4 ‘How likely do you think it is that the treat -
ment may have negative side effects?’ was reverse-scored. 
One question of the scale was adapted to take into 
account the treatment being proposed by a ‘nutritional 
therapist’ rather than a ‘psychologist’ . Scores from all 
items were summed to produce a total acceptability score 
(with a potential range of 6–42). A higher score indicates 
a greater degree of perceived acceptability. The scale has 
been reported to have acceptable internal consistency 
(with a Cronbach’s alpha of .81) and very high test-retest 
reliability (r=.78) [94].Table 1 Dietary intervention
Action point Evidence for change in microbiome
1. Eat at least seven servings of different plants each day Vegetables, 
fruits, pulses, beans, herbs, spices, seeds and nuts are all counted as 
plants.Vegetable fibre stimulates gut bacteria [67, 85, 86].
30+ different plant types/week increases microbial diversity [69].
2. Eat food within a 12-h window each day Time ‑restricted eating enhances diversity of the gut microbiome [70–72].
3. Consume 125 ml Kefir drink each day Daily kefir for 4 weeks increases Lactobacillus in gut [73].
4. Eat a microbiome-friendly, protein-rich breakfast from a pre -
scribed menu
A sample breakfast menu was provided (see additional file 1). Inclusion 
of protein and prebiotic fibre in the form of nuts, seeds, vegetables and 
fruit.Protein increases satiety [87, 88].
Prebiotic fibre promotes growth of beneficial gut bacteria [67, 85, 86].
5. Reduce consumption of added sugar and artificial sweeteners Low fibre/high sugar diets associated with lower diversity of gut bacteria [89, 
90].
Artificial sweeteners decrease beneficial microbes [60, 91].

End of study questionnaire
In order to assess parents’ experiences with, and opin -
ions of, the dietary intervention, parents were asked to 
complete a short end-of-study questionnaire. The sur -
vey consisted of nine questions exploring parents’ per -
ceived changes in children’s behaviour, mood, sleep and 
gut function (e.g. ‘Have you seen any positive/negative 
changes in your child’s behaviour during the course of the 
study?’) and cost implications of the study (e.g. ‘Did tak -
ing part in the study have any cost implications for your 
family?). Options to choose from included ‘yes’ , ‘no’ , ‘not 
sure’ and a space for additional comments was also pro -
vided. Responses to items were considered to inform the 
evaluation of the study and the development of the RCT.
Additional outcome measures assessed Time 1 and Time 2
Additional assessments (shown in Table  2) were con -
ducted at Time 1 and Time 2 to assess the feasibility of 
data collection and outcome measurements for the main 
RCT.
Analytical methods
Participant characteristics and outcomes were summa -
rised using descriptive statistics: mean (standard devia -
tion) for continuous variables and number (percent) for categorical variables. Analysis of feasibility outcomes was 
based on descriptive statistics. With the small number of 
participants in this feasibility study, there was no formal 
hypothesis related to efficacy and no inferential statistics 
were used on the data obtained, as per best practice [82].
Results
Recruitment and participants
The study was advertised to 230 families through two 
London based child ADHD support groups. Two follow-
up emails were sent and information about the study was 
also shared on Twitter, gaining a total of 15,289 impres -
sions. Sixteen families expressed interest in the study. 
Two participants were excluded for taking medication, 
one was excluded for being outside the age range, one 
was excluded because the timing of the study did not 
work and a further three failed to respond to further 
contact. The first nine who were eligible to take part 
were enrolled onto the study (6 male; 3 female) between 
November 2018 and May 2019. Participants ranged from 
8 to 13 years at the commencement of the trial, with a 
mean age of 10.39 years (SD 1.67). All children had a pre -
vious clinical diagnosis of ADHD according to DSM-V 
criteria (1). One child had to take a course of antibiot -
ics after enrolment onto the study and was permitted

to continue with the trial, given that the primary aim of 
this trial was to assess feasibility. This child was excluded 
from the microbiome analysis.
Primary outcome
The primary outcome measure was completion of the 
study, measured as the number of participants who com -
pleted the trial. All nine participants (100%) completed 
the study as shown in Fig.  1. Two participants (22%) 
missed one task (a Conners CI teacher questionnaire and 
the end of study stool sample respectively). There was a 
small amount of Time 2 actigraphy data lost for one par -
ticipant due to watch strap breakage. One stool sample 
was not returned at Time 2 and one additional partici -
pant was excluded from the microbiome analysis because 
they had to take a course of antibiotics during the inter -
vention—the microbiome analysis was conducted on 
seven participants. Attendance at sessions was 100% for 
all except one participant, who attended two out of the 
four sessions and was provided with the information 
from these sessions through telephone consultations and 
emails. Data were analysed from all participants (except 
in the above instances). Demographic and clinical char -
acteristics of the participants, at baseline, are shown in 
Table 3.
It was difficult to recruit participants for the study. 
Although we cannot know for certain why the uptake 
for the study was low, parents who took part in the trial 
indicated informally that other families they knew with 
a child with ADHD thought a major dietary intervention 
would be too difficult for the family to undertake and 
something they did not have the skills or time to imple -
ment or that their child was a very fussy eater which 
would make participation difficult.
Adherence to each aspect of the dietary protocol
All participants provided completed food diaries at the 
relevant time points in the study. Parental report of die -
tary adherence to each aspect of the dietary protocol was 
analysed. A score of 0–100% was calculated for each par -
ticipant to reflect their compliance with each of the five 
aspects of the diet, which was reported for each of the 42 
days during the 6-week trial. Mean adherence, across all 
participants, is shown in Fig.  2. Perceived ease and dif -
ficulty of adherence to dietary requirements is shown in 
Table  4 and is broadly consistent with the actual adher -
ence rates.
Adverse events
Two participants reported a mild (grade 1) adverse event 
during the intervention. One participant experienced a 
single episode of vomiting in week two of the interven -
tion and another participant experienced a single episode 
Fig. 1 Flow of participants through the study
Page 8 of 15 Lawrence et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:108 
of vomiting in week five of the intervention. The cause for 
both of these events was unknown. It was not perceived 
by the parents as related to the dietary changes in the 
study. One event was on the same day as a vaccination 
and the other during a period of suspected heat-stroke. 
Both participants continued with the intervention with 
no further adverse events. No other adverse events were 
reported during the course of the intervention.
Parent -rated acceptability of the treatment
Mean treatment acceptability score for the adapted Treat -
ment Acceptability Scale was 38.22 (SD = 3.49, minimum 
= 30, maximum = 42). The range for this questionnaire is 6–42, with a higher score indicating greater acceptability. 
Results indicated that parents rated the treatment closer 
to the ‘very acceptable’ endpoint of the dimension, than 
to the ‘very unacceptable’ endpoint, indicating a very 
good level of acceptability of the treatment.
Parents’ perceptions of changes during the intervention
Parents’ perceived positive changes in children’s behav -
iour, mood and gut function are shown in Table  5. In 
terms of sleep, two parents reported improvements in 
sleep and three parents reported that children had good 
sleep habits prior to starting the intervention. Some par -
ents also noted negative changes in behaviour, mood and 
sleep—with some noting positive and negative changes 
within the same category. Parents reported a positive 
impact of the intervention on gut function (i.e. more fre -
quent bowel movements, less constipation, less wind and 
improved stool consistency) with only one parent report -
ing a potentially negative outcome (i.e. flatulence). The 
majority of the parents perceived that the study had cost 
implications.Table 3 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics

Descriptive statistics for outcome variables
The study is reported in adherence to the CONSORT 
extension to pilot and feasibility studies [80, 81], and as 
such, it is inappropriate to conduct inferential statistics 
on the outcome measures [82]. Descriptive data were 
explored for changes in outcome measures for prelimi -
nary evidence of potential effects and to guide the selec -
tion of primary outcomes for the RCT. Table  6 shows 
the values for the outcome measures at baseline (Time 
1) and at the study endpoint (Time 2 ). The purpose of 
this study was not to explore efficacy. However, some of 
the outcome variables showed a tendency for a change 
in the direction of improvement in outcomes, includ -
ing parent and teacher-reported ADHD symptoms and all actigraphy measures of sleep quality. There was no 
tendency for improvement on the computerised test of 
cognitive function, questionnaire measures of sleep or 
gastrointestinal symptoms.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 
novel microbiome-targeted dietary intervention in order 
to support the development of a future RCT. The study 
encountered recruitment challenges and it was difficult 
to find medication-free children whose families were 
willing to take on the dietary changes. However, for those 
who took part, the dietary intervention was acceptable, 
feasible, and well-tolerated in children with ADHD. All Table 5 Perceived positive (+) and negative (−) changes in behaviour, mood, sleep, gut function and cost implications following the

participants who enrolled in the study completed the 
6-week dietary intervention and assessments, with only 
one participant failing to return a stool sample at the 
end of the intervention, and one participant missing a 
CI teacher report at Time 2. Adherence to the different 
aspects of the dietary protocol was very high.
Adherence to daily kefir and the microbiome friendly 
protein-rich breakfast were both high at 97.6%, with 
100% adherence for more than half of the participants. 
Over 90% adherence was achieved for the consumption 
of seven or more plants per day and over 80% adher -
ence was achieved for the 12-h overnight fast. The low -
est adherence was for the avoidance of added sugar and 
artificial sweeteners, at just over 60%. These results were 
echoed in the ease of adherence feedback provided by 
the parents. Parents suggested that for the avoidance of 
sugar, social situations such as parties and school events 
were problematic. One parent reported that this was, 
‘easy during the week when [s/he] was with me and eat -
ing at home but difficult at weekends when socialising 
with other children, especially at parties’ . Further feed -
back provided in the end of study questionnaire and that 
came out during discussions with parents was that there 
were sugary snacks, sweets and cakes provided as treats 
at school for special occasions, other children’s birthdays, 
end of term parties etc., which made complete exclusion 
very difficult. Based on this feedback, the complete exclu -
sion of sugar for a research trial in this age group could 
be very difficult to adhere to and future research should 
take this into consideration.
There were two isolated grade 1, mild, adverse events 
reported during the course of the dietary intervention. 
These were both single episodes of vomiting (in differ -
ent participants). There was no reason to think that these 
adverse events were precipitated by the diet, although 
this cannot be ruled out. Both participants continued 
with the diet with no further adverse events reported for 
them or any of the other participants. One of the most 
widely used treatments for children with ADHD is medi -
cation, such as Ritalin (Methylphenidate). However, tol -
erability of such medication has proven to be an issue, 
with significant dropout rates reported [105]. The lack of 
severe or frequent adverse events reported for this diet, 
together with a zero-dropout rate in this small sample, 
suggest it is a safe and tolerable intervention to be further 
explored in children with ADHD.
Parents rated the diet as being an acceptable treat -
ment using the Hunsley Treatment Acceptability Scale 
[94], with a mean acceptability score of 38.22 which was 
towards the upper endpoint of the scale (theoretical 
range 6–42). This suggests a very good degree of accept -
ability; there are no set points of reference for this scale 
but a previous study using this scale has reported a score of 33.61 as reflecting high acceptability [106]. For 
an intervention to have a good chance of being adopted 
within the ADHD population it is important that it is 
considered to be rated highly in terms of acceptabil -
ity. Previous research has suggested that Ritalin is rated 
lower in comparison to behavioural interventions in 
terms of acceptability as an intervention for ADHD [107]. 
Good levels of perceived acceptability for this dietary 
intervention should be beneficial to recruitment of par -
ticipants for an RCT.
Many families felt that following the diet had both time 
and cost implications. They reported spending more time 
on food preparation and shopping than usual and spend -
ing more money on food than they would normally. The 
exact increase in food cost is not something which was 
formally assessed. A trial implementing a modified Medi -
terranean diet in adults with depressive disorder found 
that those following the diet (which was similar in nature 
to that advised in this study) actually spent less money on 
their weekly shop than those in the control [108]. This 
possible contradiction underscores the need to test eco -
nomic implications formally in future work.
One aim of this feasibility study was to evaluate data 
collection and outcome measures to assess their prac -
ticality for use in an RCT. Parents, teachers and partici -
pants showed an exceptionally high level of compliance 
for all the measures. Parents commented that online 
questionnaires were easier to complete than paper ones 
and should be considered for future studies. Participants 
were all compliant in wearing the ‘Motionlogger Micro 
watch’ to take actigraphy recordings of sleep and all 
were returned at the end of the study. There were three 
breakages of watch straps during the study. This inter -
fered with the data collection and the 7-day period had 
to be re-started for two children and for one child (in 
the post-study recording period) was cut short resulting 
in data loss of 48 h. On this basis, we recommend care -
ful assessment of watch strap durability, and possibly the 
use of Velcro watch straps, when carrying out actigraphy 
research in child participants with ADHD.
The final aim of the research was to explore the change 
in outcome measures for preliminary evidence of poten -
tial effects. Parent and Teacher rated mean ADHD 
T-scores fell within the very elevated score range (>70) 
at both time points, decreasing from Time 1 to Time 2 
whilst self-reported scores for this measure showed 
minimal change. The results are suggestive that this 
outcome may be worth investigating further in a larger 
trial. Short-term visual working memory was found to 
be fairly accurate at both time points and did not appear 
to be sensitive to improvements during the course of the 
study. It may be worth exploring alternative neuropsy -
chological tests, with higher rates of test-retest reliability, 
Page 11 of 15
 Lawrence et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:108 
 
for any future studies. The actigraphy measures of sleep 
showed a consistent pattern for small improvements in 
sleep quality, with a reduction in total sleep duration; 
by improving sleep quality it can be consolidated [109]. 
The parent and child sleep questionnaires showed little 
change over the course of the study, with scores show -
ing a marginal increase (worsening of sleep). It has been 
noted previously that conclusions can differ whether 
sleep is measured subjectively or objectively [110] stress -
ing the importance of using different methods to assess 
sleep in this cohort. On this basis, we recommend the use 
of both actigraphy and questionnaire measures of sleep 
for future RCTs.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, were low at both Time 
1 and Time 2. Due to the lack of severe gut symptoms, 
alternative questionnaires, which capture a less extreme 
range of gut symptoms, may be worth exploring for use 
in a future RCT in this population. The initial explora -
tory analysis of the microbiome test results highlighted 
a modest change in the alpha diversity score from Time 
1 to Time 2. Several studies describe low alpha diversity 
as a factor contributing to the pathogenesis of ADHD 
[47, 111, 112] with recently published clinical evidence 
indicating that significantly lower Shannon index alpha 
diversity scores are seen in young ADHD patients com -
pared to healthy controls [48]. Noteworthy observations 
at the family level include changes in Lachnospiraceae, 
Roseburia and Blautia, Bifidobacteriaceae, Sutterella, 
Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroides. These are beyond 
the scope of this article but suggest the importance of 
detailed microbiome exploration in future research. In 
terms of methodology, 16S rRNA sequencing methodol -
ogy was adequately sensitive for detecting variations in 
microbial diversity and composition in this initial pilot 
study. However, many of the microbes were identified 
as ‘unspecified’ members of a particular taxon. Shotgun 
metagenomics, which sequences all genomic DNA from 
a sample [113] and provides greater specificity, may be a 
more appropriate sequencing method for a larger scale 
RCT for its scope to provide a greater level of depth in 
unravelling a mechanistic link between diet and ADHD.
This feasibility study has a number of limitations 
which need to be considered when interpreting the find -
ings. First, the trial was run on a very small number of 
participants who may not be representative of the wider 
ADHD population. Second, the families who took part 
in the trial all appeared to be highly engaged and moti -
vated to adhere to the dietary intervention which was a 
crucial factor in achieving the good adherence rates. Die -
tary interventions require an investment of time, energy 
and will-power from both the child and caregivers and as 
such the family situation and motivational factors could 
have profound implications on the degree to which a child is able to comply with the diet. A third limitation 
is that parents and participants were not blinded to the 
condition. As this study was assessing feasibility rather 
than efficacy, this is not a major concern but it may mean 
that demand characteristics are present on the subjective 
measures. Interestingly, where both objective (actigra -
phy) and subjective (questionnaire) measures were used, 
it was the objective measures which showed a more con -
sistent trend for improvement. It may be important to 
consider, for future trials, whether it would be more man -
ageable to focus on one aspect of the diet that had very 
high levels of compliance, such as the inclusion of seven 
or more servings of plants, the microbiome friendly, pro -
tein-rich breakfast or the consumption of kefir. Supple -
mentation with kefir could most easily be paired with a 
well-matched control condition and may be less demand -
ing on families. This could facilitate recruitment, which 
was problematic for this study, and increase the chances 
of running an RCT in a time-efficient manner.
Conclusion
The main aim of performing this feasibility study was 
to pilot several components of the trial prior to the 
development of an RCT. To our knowledge, this study 
provides the first evidence of the feasibility of imple -
menting a microbiome-targeted dietary intervention in 
children with ADHD. Recruitment of participants into 
this trial was challenging, which is an important con -
sideration for planning future studies. The primary aim 
of the current study was to assess what proportion of 
the participants completed the 6-week dietary interven -
tion. A completion rate of 100% suggests that, in highly 
motivated families, following this dietary intervention 
for 6 weeks is achievable and realistic. There were a 
number of secondary aims: (1) Percentage adherence 
to each aspect of the dietary protocol was assessed 
and found to be very good with patterns of adherence 
revealing what aspects of the diet might be easier to 
achieve compliance for in future studies; (2) Two mild 
adverse events were recorded during the course of the 
trial (which were not likely directly related to the inter -
vention), suggesting the diet would be safe to trial on a 
larger population; (3) Parent rated acceptability of the 
treatment was found to be very good indicating that the 
diet is considered to be an acceptable treatment in this 
small group of families; (4) Data collection and out -
come measures were evaluated to assess their feasibility 
for use in an RCT – we propose the use of online ques -
tionnaires and actigraphy watches with Velcro straps 
would be beneficial to implement in future research; (5) 
Although no formal inferential statistics were used for 
efficacy testing in this small sample, many of the out -
come measures showed interesting patterns of results 
Page 12 of 15 Lawrence et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:108 
for ADHD symptoms, sleep and gut microbiome. 
Overall, the results support the further exploration of 
a microbiome targeted dietary intervention in children 
with ADHD. This study provides the first evidence of 
the feasibility of implementing a microbiome-targeted 
diet, supplemented with kefir, in children with ADHD. 
Recruitment was challenging and it is suggested that 
a future larger-scale study may benefit from using a 
dietary intervention that requires less parental time 
and input, in order to recruit an adequate number of 
participants.
