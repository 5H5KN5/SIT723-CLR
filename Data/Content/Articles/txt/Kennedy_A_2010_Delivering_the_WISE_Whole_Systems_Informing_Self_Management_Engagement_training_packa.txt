Abstract
Background: The WISE (Whole System Informing Self-management Engagement) approach encompasses creating,
finding, and implementing appropriate self-care support for people with long-term conditions. A training package
for primary care to introduce the approach was developed and underwent formative evaluation. This entailed
exploring the acceptability of the WISE approach and its effectiveness in changing communication within
consultations. The study aimed to refine the patient, practitioner, and patient level components of the WISE
approach and translate the principles of WISE into an operational intervention deliverable through National Health
Service training methods.
Methods: Normalisation Process Theory provided a framework for development of the intervention. Practices were
recruited from an inner city Primary Care Trust in NW England. All practice staff were expected to attend two
afternoon training sessions. The training sessions were observed by members of the training team. Post-training
audio recordings of consultations from each general practitioner and nurse in the practices were transcribed and
read to provide a narrative overview of the incorporation of WISE skills and tools into consultations. Face-to-face
semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff post-training.
Results: Two practices out of 14 deemed eligible agreed to take part. Each practice attended two sessions,
although a third session on consultation skills training was needed for one practice. Fifty-four post-training
consultations were recorded from 15 clinicians. Two members of staff were interviewed at each practice. Significant
elements of the training form and methods of delivery fitted contemporary practice. There were logistical
problems in getting a whole practice to attend both sessions, and administrative staff founds some sections
irrelevant. Clinicians reported problems incorporating some of the tools developed for WISE, and this was
confirmed in the overview of consultations, with limited overt use of WISE tools and missed opportunities to
address patients ’self-management needs.
Conclusions: The formative evaluation approach and attention to normalisation process theory allowed the
training team to make adjustments to content and delivery and ensure appropriate staff attended each session.
The content of the course was simplified and focussed more clearly on operationalising the WISE approach. The
patient arm of the approach was strengthened by raising expectations of a change in approach to self-care
support by their practice.

Background
The effective management of long-term conditions is a
key focus of health for which policy and support forself-management has been a core component at local,
national and international levels [1-3]. There is a broad
policy distinction between self care, which is a part ofdaily living and self-care support. Self-care support isthe facility that health and social care services provideto enable people to take be tter care of themselves and
traditionally involves increasing the capacity, confidence,and efficacy of the individual for self care by providing arange of options [4]. A recent review suggested that
social and material resources and locality context are
also relevant influences on the capacity to support selfcare [5]. Developing and implementing training forms acore part of contemporary policy. In a documententitled Self-Care Support for the Workforce , the Depart-
ment of Health has recently o utlined expectations of
training and knowledge for p rofessionals in supporting
self care for patients. This includes the need for health-
care staff to have the right skills and knowledge to be
able to: communicate effectively; identify people ’s
strengths and abilities; provide advice on support net-works; promote choice and independence; enable peopleto manage identified risks; and provide relevant and evi-dence-based information[6].
Whole System Informing Self-management Engage-
ment (WISE) encompasses an approach to finding and
providing appropriate self-care support for people with
long-term conditions. The r ationale and the evidence
base for the WISE approach have been described else-where [7]. The whole systems approach resonates withthe Chronic Care Model proposed by Wagner, in parti-cular to ensure self-care support is considered using acollaborative approach [8]. Evidence shows that thereare difficulties in engaging existing community-based
self-care support programmes with primary care [9,10];
and there are questions about how effective such pro-grammes (set in isolation from care providers) are inimproving outcomes for people with long-term condi-tions [11]. In brief, the approach envisages enablingpatients by providing opportunities for receiving andusing more information through support and guidancefrom trained practitioners working within a healthcare
system more equipped and expecting to be responsive
to patients ’needs. The key principles incorporate the
need to be able to: work for patients and professionals,and fit with the organisation of the healthcare system;include the different ways patients currently self-man-age; build on existing skills of patients and professionals;and make certain people from underserved groups areincluded.The approach has been tried in secondary care [12,13],
but its workability and integration has yet to be morefully demonstrated within primary care teams. Withinthe health service, training tends to focus on a specificgroup (for example, medical practitioners, nurses, or
administrators) or a particular condition (for example,
diabetes care). Our approach was to develop training for
the whole team and support the development of skillsthat could, with adjustment, be used for any chroniccondition.
Complex healthcare interve ntions require a strategic
approach to their development and evaluation, particu-larly where there is ambigui ty about their use. In 2000,
the Medical Research Council (MRC) recommended a
phased development process, and the development and
use of the training package described here was based onthis and can be placed in phases I and II of the MRCframework [14,15]. The modelling phase is used toexamine and develop an intervention prior to prelimin-ary testing in a trial and has been used successfully forinterventions in primary care [16]. The exploratoryphase is used to ensure the intervention content and
delivery is optimal and can be standardised prior to a
main trial.
In terms of the evaluation, we have adopted a forma-
tive evaluation approach: ‘Formative evaluation is eva-
luation of a curricular product or program in the veryp r o c e s so fi t sf o r m a t i o n .T h ee m p h a s i si so np r o c e s s .The information generated can be used in improvingthe curriculum-in-the-making or the program during its
implementation. ’[17]. This approach to evaluation has
been used in primary care [18], and formative evalua-tions have proved useful in modifying the design andactivities of an ongoing tra ining programme [19,20]. In
line with this formative evaluative approach, we reporthere on the theory, modelling, and exploratory phases ofdeveloping an intervention to improve provision of self-care support to patients in primary care. Figure 1 out-
lines the model for the formative evaluation as linked to
the phases of the MRC framework.
The aims were: to complete development of a training
intervention for primary care teams to improve thequality of care for patients with chronic diseases; to testthe acceptability and effectiveness of the interventionamong professionals; to explore patients ’comprehension
of tools developed to support the approach; to explore
how the intervention informs and influences the clinical
practice of primary care professionals; and to explorehow the intervention is experienced by patients. Thepurpose being to ensure that the training package wasrobust and likely to be effective enough to be tested in arandomised controlled trial.Kennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/7Page 2 of 15
The exploratory study aimed to refine the patient, prac-
titioner, and practice level components of the WISE
approach into a complete i ntervention deliverable
through routine National Health Service (NHS) training
methods ( i.e. ,d e l i v e r yv i at r a i n e dp r i m a r yc a r ep r o f e s -
sionals), and to provide empirical evidence of acceptabil-
ity and effectiveness in changing professional behaviour
(results to be presented elsewhere). The main focus at
this stage was the development and use of the training
package with a whole practice team –general practitioners
(GPs), nursing staff and administrative, and support staff.
Development of the WISE training package
The aims of the training are outlined in Table 1. The
content of the training package was developed by TB,
CCG, LG, AK, and JP, and the preliminary format for the
training sessions in the exploratory phase was as follows:

Summary
The training is generic, however, for the purposes of
the randomised controlled trial (where the outcomeswill be measured at the level of patient change); thepatient level component was directed at people with dia-betes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
A number of theoretical, evidence-based, and practical
sources were drawn on for the development of the con-
tent. The Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) [21] iswell orientated to describe and explain the way in whichnew or modified practices of thinking, enacting, andorganising work associated with WISE are operationa-lised in healthcare. In order to understand the embed-ding of a practice, we must look at what people actuallydo and how they work. The Normalisation Process
Model (NPM) [22] has been developed from existing
evaluation studies, and as a conceptual framework hasutility in sensitising the research to the reaction, incor-poration, or rejection of WISE from a service user, pro-fessional, and organisational perspective. The success (orfailure) of interventions is predicated on the potential
for embedding new inter ventions within normal ‘every-
day ’practices and during the development of the WISE
training package. We have remained sensitive to the
processes and conditions required for a particular strat-egy to become a routine, taken-for-granted, element ofclinical practice. In practice, the impact on the develop-ment of the training package was a continual process oftrying to simplify the message and making sure the con-tent was linked both to day-to-day activities and theoverall structure of the whole systems approach (for
example, the mapping activity was linked to patients
with diabetes, COPD or IBS and asked participants toconsider progress from reception to active self-manage-ment. Participants were asked to consider barriers tothis progress from the point of view of the patient, prac-tice staff, and practice systems).
A learning organisational approach can be applied at
practice level and may be useful for establishing prac-
tice- and team-level change [23,24]. One of the aims of

[25]. This type of cultural shift fits within a learning
organisation ethos, the features of which are: ‘celebra-
tion of success, absence of complacency, tolerance ofmistakes, belief in human pote ntial, recognition of tacit
knowledge, openness, trust and being outward looking ’
[26]. From the outset, the training was envisaged as
being delivered to a whole pr actice so that staff could
learn from each other and discuss problems in a facili-tated environment.
Evidence for current attitudes to the provision of self-
care support in primary care indicates that practicenurses have become the health professionals who aremost frequently tasked with providing self-care supportand advice for patients with long-term conditions
[27-29]. Practice nurses tend to provide the routine care
for patients whose conditions are linked to NHS Qualityand Outcome Framework (QOF) targets (such as dia-betes and COPD), and practice nurses describe theirwork as increasingly governed by templates and guide-lines [30]. On top of this, research has found that nursescurrently do not have resources or skills to provide self-care support beyond using their own experience and
intuition [29]. GPs ’responses have highlighted tensions
and tradeoffs regarding their role in facilitating self-
management. Although GPs value increased patientinvolvement in their healthcare, this conflicts with othervalues concerning profession al responsibility. Further-
more, contextual factors also limit the degree of assis-tance in encouraging self-management [27]. Patientspose problems for clinicia ns when they are unable to
understand the treatment, unprepared to engage with
new treatment, or are unready to learn new skills [31].In the role-play sessions, it was intended that askingclinicians to discuss patie nts they had problems enga-
ging with self-management would expose some of thetensions and implications of changing professional roles,as well as providing a safe environment to learn and
practice consultation skills.
The WISE approach aims to be responsive to patients ’
needs for self-care support. It has proven very difficultto ascertain or promote the patient ’sa g e n d ai np r i m a r y
care consultations, a recent randomised controlled trial
reported negative findings in consultation behaviour andpatient satisfaction when using a form to elicit thepatient ’sa g e n d ap r i o rt oac o n s u l t a t i o n[ 3 2 ] .I ti s
acknowledged that patients ha ve difficulties in expres-
sing their concerns, and that this may lead to adverse
outcomes [33]. We know that training doctors to elicitpatients ’agendas or asking patients to write down what
they want from their consultation increases patientengagement in expressing needs and getting themattended to, but embedding this and engagingprofessionals to make space for this is key, because it is
also likely to increase the length of consultations [34].This has become more salient in the UK since the intro-duction of the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF is apay-for-performance contract for UK primary care)because of the way in which it has led GPs to conduct
consultations in a more biomedical manner in accor-
dance with QOF targets [35]. The response to this chal-lenge in the WISE approach was to develop a tool tohelp bring patients ’psychosocial needs to the fore-
ground –the Patient Report Informing Self-Management
Support (PRISMS) form.
We drew on past experience of methods to improve
consultation skills to elicit behavioural changes in
patients [12,36], and introduced techniques and skills to
improve the ability of staff to work towards developinga culture of a learning organisation. The methods usedto teach problem solving skills are innovative (Figure 2)in utilising a model originally developed for individualtherapeutic encounters i n a novel way in a facilitated
group setting to address problems identified by a groupo fw o r k e r si na no r g a n i s a t i o n[ 3 7 ] .O n eo fu sh a sp r e -
viously used this approach within groups to address pro-
blems posed for doctors by ‘problem patients ’[38]. In
the modified group problem-solving session, the groupis steered to work through the stages outlined in Figure2 with the aims of identifying and jointly agreeing a listof problems and a plan with specific steps to address atleast one of these problems. The hope is that this pro-cess (used in the context of coming up with a practice-
generated plan of how to use the WISE approach and
tools within the practice) will model how future practicemeetings might work more productively through theother identified problems.
The main drivers for the structure of the training were
to present the WISE approach in as clear a way as pos-sible and to ensure the active participation of all mem-bers of the practice. The training content was developed
to introduce the practice to the thinking behind a whole
systems approach to providing self-care support topatients with long-term conditions. All participants weregiven a training manual, w hich provided background
details on the approach as well as techniques and toolsfor supporting self care within consultations and withint h eo r g a n i s a t i o n .T h ec o n t e n to ft h em a n u a lp r o v i d e daframework for the presentations and exercises carried
out during the training sessions.
The first exercise involved the practice working
together to consider how their patients currentlyreceived self-care support, and what the barriers were toimproving this. Tools developed to help the introductionof self-care support into practices were then introducedKennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7

through a presentation and d iscussion, which was fol-
lowed by presentation of a DVD that gave examples ofthe tools and approach being used within three consul-tations (with real GPs and actors taking the patient-role). The tools included:
1. The PRISMS form. The PRISMS form was devel-
oped to assist the assessment of the patient ’s psychoso-
cial needs and priorities and to allow shared decisions
to be made about appropriate self-care support. The
PRISMS tool is intended to be used to encouragepatients to think about which symptoms or personalproblems trouble them the most. These can be explored
during a consultation to agree on priorities and a planof action. See Additional File 1 for a version of thePRISMS form and instructions developed for this study.
2. The Explanatory model. Explanatory models are
ways to make sense of problems and highlight the mis-placed beliefs patients sometimes have about the man-agement of a condition and to encourage discussion
about the causes and consequences of their condition.
Patients ’explanations and understanding of a condition
often differs from the medical model. See Additional1. What is our list of problems in the practice?

3. Menu of options. The WISE training encourages
practices to develop a list of local resources and optionsavailable to provide self-care support that can be linkedto patient priorities and de velopment of longer term
‘care plans ’or ongoing follow-up care that builds on
earlier discussions. For the purposes of the WISEresearch, three guidebooks were developed with and forpatients with IBS, diabetes, and COPD. See AdditionalFile 3 for an outline of some suggested options for self-care support.
At the end of the first training session (for home-
work), the practice was asked to continue the thinking
and planning around develo ping an accessible list of
local resources and to consider the priorities for thepractice to work on to provide better self-care support.The second training sessio n continued consultation
skills training with clinicia ns and introduced problem-
solving techniques to the rest of the staff.
Methods
Ethical approval for this study was given by OldhamLocal Research Ethics Committee (REC 07/H1011/96) inJanuary 2008.
Practice selection
Practices with more than two GPs were identified withina Primary Care Trust (PCT). Practices were approachedand given basic details about the study and asked if they
would like further information. The practices who
agreed to take part in the study were asked to selecttwo training dates where all st aff (GPs, nurses, practice
managers, and clerical and reception staff) could be pre-sent for a three-hour trai ning session. Staff were
informed before the training that they would beexpected to: work on support for self care betweentraining sessions as part of their homework ( e.g., update
data on locally available self-care support options);
incorporate training tools into practice systems; nomi-
nate someone to lead on keeping the whole practiceupdated on new support options and training opportu-nities; and routinely incorporate into consultations andpractice systems WISE strategies and skills for provisionof self-care support.
Training sessions
The training sessions for the practices were led by LG,AK, and CCG, and took place between July and Novem-ber 2008. Other members of the research team acted asparticipant observers during the training and took writ-ten notes that were typed up as soon as possible. Aftereach session, the team reflected on the training and theengagement and reactions of the participants to thevarious components. Followi ng the final session, each
practice participant was asked to complete an evaluationform.
Data collection
In addition to the evaluation data from participants and
observation data, other sources of data included four
pre- and four post-training audio recordings of consulta-tions from each GP and nurse in the two practices. Sui-table patients (with diabetes, COPD, or IBS) wereidentified by practice staff at reception and asked if theywould be interested in talking to a researcher about astudy the practice was taking part in. All patients whotook part gave informed cons ent prior to the consulta-
tion and were able to withdraw from the study at any
point. Recordings were unde rtaken to provide evidence
for the effectiveness of the training and incorporation ofskills learned into routine consultations. For the pur-poses of this analysis, only the post-training recordingswere examined. The analysis of this data was undertakenat two levels: A narrative overview reading to capturethe use of WISE tools, and a fine detailed analysis of
consultation content to search for evidence of consulta-
tion behavioural change by the clinician.
In this paper we focus on the overview analysis (the
content analysis will be reported elsewhere). The over-view of post-training consultations was done by twomembers of the team (AK and CCG) to find outwhether the training had an impact on the behaviour ofprimary care providers. The purpose of the training is:
‘to encourage a structured approach to self-care sup-
port ’. The key aspects of evidence of the use of this
structured support which were sought in reading thetranscripts of the consultations were use of or referenceto the three WISE tools outlined earlier (PRISMS,Explanatory models, and use of a menu of options forself-care support).
Face-to-face interviews were undertaken after the
training with two members of staff from each practice.
A GP and the practice manager were interviewed atpractice one, and a GP and a practice nurse were inter-viewed at practice two. These interviews focussed onthe provision of self-care support for patients with dia-betes, COPD, and IBS, their experience of the WISEtraining, and their views on how the training could beimproved and rolled out across the PCT.
In summary, through qualitative analysis of multiple
sources of data, the exploratory study aimed to enhanceunderstanding and so help improve implementation ofthe WISE approach to self-care support in primary care.Using formative evaluation for these phases of establish-ing a complex intervention has allowed us to continuallyreflect and draw on the normalisation process theoryunderpinning the training [21].Kennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7

Results
A total of 14 out of 59 practices within the PCT were
large enough to be included (they had more than twofull-time GPs). These practices were all approached, and
three agreed to take part in the pilot study; however,
o n ep r a c t i c ep u l l e do u tb e f o r et h et r a i n i n gl e a v i n gt w opractices in the study.
When compared with the oth er practices in the PCT,
these practices were larger –list sizes in the upper quartile
(range for Salford general practices1,400 to 13,500) –and
served more affluent populations (Index of MultipleDeprivation scores in the lower quartile, range 6.58 to
77.18).
Description of case study practices
Practice one
The practice has been established for more than 30
years, with a list size of around 8,000 patients. Thedeprivation score for the area is 23.99. It has four GPs,two nurses, and one nursing assistant who conduct
clinics for COPD, diabetes, CHD, asthma, and blood
pressure monitoring. The practice provides consulta-tion facilities for a smoking cessation support worker,an alcohol abuse counsellor, a psychologist, and apodiatrist. The practice manager is supported by ateam of approximately 12 rece ption/administrative staff
who work on either a full- or part-time basis.
Practice two
This is a long-established practice which employs eightGPs, two nurses, two nursing assistants, and a midwife.One GP has a special interest in the care of patientswith diabetes. Other practitioners who have clinics att h ep r a c t i c ei n c l u d eac o u n s ellor, a podiatrist, a phy-
siotherapist, and visiting consultants. The practice
m a n a g e ri ss u p p o r t e db yat e a mo fm o r et h a n2 0reception/administrative staff who work on either a
full- or part-time basis. The practice had a list of just
over 12,000 patients, and the deprivation score for thearea is 14.24.
Tables 2 and 3 give details of the attendance at the
four training sessions and the evaluation scores. Staff atpractice one were more satisfied with the training thanthose at practice two where not all the sessions wereconsidered suitable for all members of staff.Observations and reflections on the training content
Care pathway –process mapping
These exercises –where participants were asked to map
the process of care from reception to self-managementand then to identify barriers and problems to providingand promoting self-care support –worked well with both
practices.
Practice one
’Split into two groups of five and six which appeared
to work well and at end of exercise it led to groups
comparing each other ’s‘work ’and element of
healthy competition and banter –useful team-building
exercise. Most members of each group participated.Both groups got going with the task and createddebate around each other ’s roles and what goes on
at each point in the process. ’(observer one)
Practice two
’The comments of some participants during this
exercise provided evidence of staff becoming awareof hitherto unrecognised re sponsibilities undertaken
by their colleagues in the course of this process....This exercise was observed to stimulate awarenessamong the entire group of the issues that were feltto either detract from the service provided or placean additional burden on particular members of staff.
Despite not perceived as wielding the greatest power
in terms of determining policy and practice, itappeared that this task provided a useful forum forreception staff in particular to make practitionersaware of the demands placed upon them in organis-ing the steady stream of patients that they customa-rily receive for consultation. ’(observer two)
Use of the DVD exemplar
During discussion after v iewing the DVD, GPs raised
concerns that this part of the training was not necessarilyrelevant to other members of the practice team ( e.g.,
reception staff). Observer one heard people say that ‘this
is what we do already ’. Members of the research team
reflected that this was perhaps not unexpected and indi-cates that the training was relevant and appropriate, but
that more emphasis on impr oving current skills and
practice was needed. The observed use of the WISE toolsmet with approval, and the DVD could be seen to pro-vide examples of how they might fit these into practice:

It proved impossible for all staff to attend both training sessions due to work and annual leave commitments.Kennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/7Page 8 of 15
‘Staff remarked how true to life the comments and
reactions of patients/actors seen in the film actuallywere, e.g., in relation to patients deciding to cut back
or cease taking prescribed medication on the basis
of their perception of the severity of their symptoms,
and even the sense of denial for their diagnosedunderlying condition. ’(observer two)
Introducing WISE tools –PRISMS, explanatory models and
menu of options
Both practices reported liking the PRISMS tool and said
they wished to use it with their patients. Part of the train-
ing involved getting the practice to determine methods todistribute and use the PRISMS forms, and both practicescame up with practical solutions. The explanatory modelwas also picked up as something the practices couldwork with and adjust to their needs –clinicians in practice
one decided to develop an animated computerised ver-sion for use in consultations and also came up with a
suggestion of another pictorial method to explain theneed for behavioural change to patients. Staff in practice
two decided, as part of their homework after session one,that they would document the explanatory models theyalready used or came across. In terms of the menu of
options, both practices were able to nominate someone
who would collate a list of locally available self-care sup-port options. It is interesting to note that in practice two,most knowledge of local support services was said to be‘in the heads of the receptionists ’.
Problem solving
The problem-solving session was intended to link to the
progress the practice had made with the WISE-related
tasks they set themselves at the initial training sessions. Inboth practices, little progress had been made and by groupconsensus the first problem-solving session involved allmembers of the practice and focussed on the communica-tion problems that had become apparent during the carepathway mapping exercise. Both practices had successfulresolutions in the form of practical action plans; for prac-
tice one, this was to set up a regular meeting for all staff,Table 3 Evaluation of the training

and for practice two, it was to initiate a mandatory coffee
break during the day to allow informal discussions.
In the second problem-solving session, in practice one,
the participants decided to continue working togetherand were successful in developing a plan for distributingPRISMS forms to patients. In practice two, the group
split to allow the clinicians to have consultation skills
training separately. Problem solving with the rest of thestaff involved getting WISE strategies into practice;plans were formulated by the group but without realengagement with the ethos of the approach.
Skills training/role playing
These sessions were designed to give clinicians the
opportunity to discuss diff icult cases with their peers
and to provide guidance on the skills and techniques(linked to the WISE tools) needed to support and moti-vate patients to change their behaviour (see Table 1). Inboth practices, the need for using motivational techni-ques, as opposed to trying to educate patients who donot want to engage, was recognised as being very impor-tant but hard to put into practice.
In practice one, an additional session was required for
this part of the training as the whole practice stayedengaged with the problem solving sessions. In practicetwo, the observer noted:
’The practitioners present seemed to recognise the
potential benefit of ‘opening up ’the agenda. This
was an active discussion in which the majority of the
practitioners engaged in a jovial and thought-pro-
voking session that appeared to follow on well fromthe exercises that had gone before it. There appearedto be a strong sense that the practitioners were gen-uinely keen to hear any advice that could be offeredto them. ’(observer two)
Overview of post-training consultation transcripts
Fifty-four post-training consultation transcripts were
obtained from 15 clinicians. The overview analysis (AKand CCG) found overt use of WISE tools andapproaches ( i.e., use of the PRISMS form, explanatory
models, or a menu of options) in eight consultations,
and attempts to give self-care support in 11 consulta-tions. The reading of the consultations did offer insights
into how the training could be improved. (Note, in the
quotes below, the ID refers to a consultation).
Main learning points for training
GP and nurse consultations differed. Nurses ’consulta-
tions tended to be closely linked to protocols andcomputer templates. GPs seemed to be driven more bya biomedical agenda –either as presented by the patient
or the GP in that consultations were orientated to themanagement of or discussion of symptoms and medi-cation. Thus, routinised habits and styles of consultingmay not be readily amenable to change, but using thewords or formats from the training pack may help and
focus on contemplating prospective changes over time
or reflecting on why things are the way that they are.There was some evidence of this in the transcripts:
’so, you know, what I ’m hearing is that... it is quite
a... a struggle at the moment in terms of fittingeverything in, you ’ve got young children, you ’ve got
your job, and... and you ’ve got your diabetes to cope
with... ’(ID 111)
There were several examples where patients offered up
cues where self-management could have been discussed,however, these were seemingly infrequently followed upby clinicians with specific advice. In the followingexcerpt of a consultation with a patient who brings anumber of problems to the GP, the GP ignores the cue
about relaxation and focuses on measuring blood pres-
sure. The rest of the consultation is about medications:
GP: ‘No if you just let that arm go nice and floppy
we’ll rest it on there. That ’s great. OK you sit back
and relax –’
Pt: ‘That ’s a thing I can ’t do. I ’m on... ’
GP: ‘OK. ’
Pt: ‘I’ve been worse this weekend. ’
[sound of machine]GP: ‘You sit back and close your eyes. ’[sound of
machine and typing] ... ‘OK ’. [typing –sound of
machine again –typing] .... ‘OK, blood pressure ’sa
touch better, its still not there though is it? ’(ID 120)
When the PRISMS form was introduced by the GP
at the end of consultation, it appeared to be used as
something to take away at the end of a consultation –
equivalent to a prescription. This meant that patientsmay have perceived it as irrelevant to negotiating mat-ters with the GP (particularly if the patient was thentold to bring it back to the practice nurse):
’When you bring it in for the nurse she ’ll be able to
say, ‘ah right, OK, well these are your problems, does
that fit with what we ’re trying to do for you and how
can we... ’and this is just the explanation of how you
do it. OK, so do it for us, and if you bring that inwhen you see the nurse, it ’
ll help us tailor things
more towards you so hopefully you ’ll be able to
understand why we ’re doing things as well., (ID 125)Kennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/7Page 10 of 15
It seems to be important that PRISMS and bringing in
the patient ’s agenda be anticipated and included at the
start of the consultation, otherwise the consultation startsand progresses along a biomedical tract. For GPs, thepatient needs to fill in PRISMS prior to a consultation, orthe GP needs to introduce it early on. The GP needs to
give it due emphasis and demonstrate that the patient ’s
actual problems and needs are important. For nurses,unless PRISMS and the introduction of the patient agendaappear directly in the protocol/computer template, itreduces the likelihood that it will be integrated into every-day use. One option is for practices to find some way ofchanging the computer templates they use; this might bemost effectively undertaken at a PCT level for diabetes
and COPD. Again, it needs to appear early in the process
in order to affect the nature of the consultation.
Both GPs and practice nurses referred to other
resources ( i.e., a menu of options), but this did not fit
naturally within their current style of consulting, somore direction in how to introduce resources, and howt oi n c o r p o r a t et h i sm o r en a t u r a l l yi n t oac o n s u l t a t i o nneeds to be built in. The use of explanatory models
(apart from medical explanations of symptoms due to
organic pathology) was limited to attempts to encourageincreased exercise for those with COPD. So, potentialuse needs to be expanded upon and practiced withinthe role-play sessions:
Patient: ‘Do you think that the exercising does help? ’
Clinician: ‘It definitely... the more active you are the
better it is. ’
Patient: ‘Yes. I do all sorts, I ... ’
Clinician: ‘Because, unfortunately, a lot of people
[stop] when they [become] breathless, instead of try-ing to keep going. ’
Patient: ‘They stop? ’
Clinician: ‘They stop doing what they do because
they ’re frightened of getting breathless, and then the
less they do the more breathless they become when
they do something. (ID 85)
Findings from interviews with practice members
Analysis and reading of these interviews was undertakenin the context of the training observations and from theperspective of NPT [21]. In terms of refining the train-
ing package to better ensure the WISE approach can be
adopted in practice, two key issues emerged: one relatedto implementing the training, and the other to the useof the tools to assess patient need.
Implementation of training
Data gathered about running the initial training sessionsrevealed that practice staff are not able to fully orientatethemselves towards chronic disease management where
there are pressing prior unmet and unrelated agendas.This was evident at a number of levels. What peoplegained most from the training was the opportunity tointeract and work with fellow practice staff. For admin-istrative staff, problems and barriers to care within the
practice centred on communication. The focus on
chronic illness pathways act ed as a focal point for dis-
cussing this, but was not the primary focus of benefitsin the first training session. The intention was to get thepractice to think about ways and means to introducethe WISE tools and approach:
’And I think if one thing I will take away from this,
even ... and I can ’t ... obviously can ’t comment about
what the patients have gained from it or the doctorshave gained, but the one thing that I think we ’ve
gained from it is communic ation, how important it
is for us as a practice, because everybody ’ss ob u s y
in their own sort of work, me with mine and thedoctors with theirs and the nurses... so, quite often,you do work in isolation. You don ’tsort of talk to
each other, so I think one thing, if anything, we ’re
going to try and... we have...now having meetingsonce a month. ’(practice manager)
The training was perceived by practices as a way to
encourage teambuilding, which is seemingly most impor-tant in busy practice where colleagues rarely meet. Thefollowing quote illustrates that there may be a hierarchy of
training needs for practices, i.e., a need to provide team-
building and communication opportunities before thepractice can move on to make changes in patient care:
’Well it went... I don ’t know whether ... the... train-
ing... helped us that much... as in... it was quiteenjoyable I must say, and it was quite good for teambuilding, so if nothing else it ... you know, I think it
helped the practice and with luck that will help the
patients, you know... a knock-on effect. But how itwas it was quite related to, you know, involving thepatients and things like that, I wasn ’t... too sure. ’
(GP1)
WISE time out was seen as a chance to do something
together, which is more than the focus on functional
type triage. Staff have to find subversive ways of com-
municating beyond an increasing focus on roles. Inpractice two, the action for the practice to take forwardfollowing the problem-solving session was to institute amandatory coffee break.
Clinicians struggle to provide self-care support as part
of everyday practice in part because of the crowded,multiple, and complex processes that make up theKennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/7Page 11 of 15
day-to-day work of practices. A practice nurse described
the tensions between meeting guideline targets andthinking of needs from the patient ’s perspective:
’It h i n kw e ’re all aware that when we ’re doing these
things it is for the patients ’good as well. It ’st r y i n g
to get that balance between, you know, asking all the
things, doing the, you kno w, blood pressure, doing
the weight, all of that, and actually looking, lookingas a person. ’(practice nurse)
PRISMS and training
There was a ‘disjointed ’feel about introducing the
PRISMS form, and these were not immediately accom-
modated into the existing regime. It was hard to embednew aspects of patient management; the clinicians haddifficulty building WISE tools into their practice. Thesocial and cultural distance from the patient agenda wasilluminated by difficulties in engaging with assessmentfor patient need. There was evidence of ‘shoe horning ’
this into practices where consultations are designed for
QOF assessments and monitoring [35,39]:
’The dependency for doctors to become just QOF-
centric. And they come in, and they notice, oh, thispatient needs this, this, this thing under QOF, asopposed to the illness th e QOF patients actually
come in with. I think there ’s a difficulty getting that
balance between sort of what a doctor wants and
what the patient needs. ’(GP2)
There was an existing assumption and view that the
staff were already patient centred enough, so it was notclear that the type of assessment of needs that thePRISMS form was designed to assist was needed:
’... And then when we did the training.... I didn ’t find
it particularly helpful .... because it tended to be ... it
tended to sort of emphasise being patient focussedand I think we do that... well I certainly try and dothat. ’(GP2)
’I also... I sort of think maybe in a practice like this
that to a degree we were certain, we were probablydoing it already, so we try and get to the bottom of
the patient... you know, the main, their concerns and
deal with that concern, and its knowing that, OK, so
we spent a long time on that today, and we haven ’t
done that, but we can do that next time. ’(practice
nurse)
However, when linking these comments with observa-
tions about the recorded consultations, it became appar-ent that the existing focus of consultations with peoplewith diabetes and COPD is on measuring what is wrong
in terms of symptoms needing monitoring (such asblood glucose levels) and using equipment to monitorthem (such as a spirometer); though it is not clear whatIBS shows in this respect, and this is an issue for clini-cians because there are no accepted guidelines to draw
on:
’That ’s not ... obviously people have a diagnosis, but
it’s not a condition we have on any recall systems...
because it doesn ’t have anything behind it like
national guidelines. ’(practice nurse)
This process tends to exclude rather than engage
patient needs, and the QOF biomedical agenda rein-
forces this. This means there are some difficulties inbringing forth explicit and conscious needs that can bedealt with by patients, and their agendas remain hidden.Even when patients try to bring their concerns to thefore and openly seek self-management advice, thisbecomes subsumed in the guideline-directed consulta-tion:
’No overt WISE behaviour. Diabetes check/review.
Patient obviously has several questions and self-man-agement queries. GP gives very little information andmisses cue to give self-management diet advicethough gives a bit of advic e on fruit juice. Explains
planned care programme operated by practice. ’(Nar-
rative notes from consultation ID 95)
’No WISE strategies from nurse –just task orientated.
Patient tries to bring co-morbidity into consulta-tion –nurse ignores and focus on diabetes. Patient
indicates how much has already changed behaviour –
diet, drinking. ’(Narrative notes from consultation ID
130)
Discussion
The main purpose of the exploratory study and its eva-luation was to refine the training package in such a wayas to make the training in the definitive study workable,effective, and to fulfil the aim of enabling the WISEapproach to become normalised into everyday practice;using the NPT has helped to highlight key issues.Attempting to introduce changes to ways of thinking
and working in a whole practice during two three-hour
training sessions illuminate s the challenges of operatio-
nalising an intervention in a way that engages profes-sionals in training. It requires reconsidering howeveryday practice can accommodate small changeswhilst maintaining an ethos of limiting disruption toroutines and everyday ways of working in generalpractice.Kennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7

Refresh on WISE approach: 10 minutes

Show DVD plus discussion: 30 minutes
Skills training –role play difficult cases: two hours

WISE: 20 minutes
T h el o g i s t i c so fg e t t i n gaw h o l ep r a c t i c et o g e t h e rf o r
two sessions proved difficult, so we have decided to
change the format and only include all practice staff inthe first session. This will have the advantage of accul-turating the whole practice to the ethos of the self-caresupport approach without alienating people by requiringattendance they feel is irre levant to their role. The
interactive care pathways e xercise proved an effective
way of getting people engaged in discussing their
responsibilities and barrier st op r o v i d i n gs e l f - c a r es u p -
port, so this has not been changed, and it does appearto assist in the development of practices as reflectivelearning organisations [26]. The problem-solving techni-q u ew o r k e da saw a yt oe n g a g ead i s p a r a t eg r o u pi ndeveloping pragmatic action plans, so we have decidedto focus this part of the training on exploring and sol-ving problems related to o perationalising WISEstrategies, rather than asking practices to set their own
agenda. This will help to ensure the training gets prac-tice members to work together to improve self-caresupport for their patients, rather than spending trainingtime dealing with the inevitable communication pro-blems every organisation has (the expectation being that
problem-solving skills will be something the practice
learns to draw on in the future to resolve other, moregeneral, management problems).
Whilst we had intended that the DVD be used to
explain to everyone how WISE techniques could bedelivered in a consultation, we recognise that this ismore appropriate for clinicians, and that the DVD canbe given as a resource to the practice for other members
of staff to view when they wish. The training manual
has been amended so that it more closely follows thecontent of the course and is more user-friendly with theuse of colour and stills from the DVD.
It became apparent that there are likely to be key
members of staff who are keen to take up and co-ordi-nate the WISE strategies, and that it is likely to be moreeffective for trainers to work with this small group than
to try to engage the whole practice after an initial intro-
duction session.
The final session is now devoted to training clinicians
in consultation skills. Implementation of the WISEapproach has to take place in the context of consulta-tions with other predominate drives (such as meetingQOF targets). Although the WISE approach and toolsmet with clinicians ’approval, they were hard to inte-
grate into practice, and skills were easy to dismiss as
being too similar to perceived current behaviour. Toovercome this and challenge the status quo and resis-tance to change, the skills training was given a tighterstructure and closely linked the use of WISE tools withthe opportunity to practice three core skills: How toassess what each patient can do and needs to do; howto share decisions with patients; and how to make sure
patients get the right support. The role play was rede-
signed to be carried out in small groups of three, withthe group taking turns to be the clinician, the patient,or the observer.
One key finding from post-training interviews with
practice staff and data obtained from post-trainingrecordings of consultations was that the PRISMS formswere not being used routinely with patients. The room
for the patient ’s own agenda is currently limited, and we
have been looking at ways to bring this more to thefore. One aspect of this is that people with long-termconditions sometimes need to think about how they canview themselves as working in partnership with theirhealthcare professionals, and for professionals to makespace for this and encourage rather than block out thisagenda. One solution is to reinforce people ’so w nKennedy et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:7

expectations of asking about and receiving self-care sup-
port from general practitioners and nurses by providinga leaflet for practices to distribute that gives a simpleoutline of the types of su pport people can expect and
explains the purpose of the PRISMS form in a simplemanner.
Whilst two sessions of training are unlikely to lead to
dramatic changes in consultation behaviour, they shouldbe sufficient to provoke reflexive contemplation of howthis might happen over time. In addition, the WISEintervention is at multiple levels, with training rein-forced at the patient level and at the practice level.When training is delivered on a wider scale, the contextof approval and support at PCT level will provide addi-
tional encouragement for sustained change. We do,
however, know that on the recent evidence from workon the impact of QOF, it is possible to make a funda-mental impact on the process of the consultation.
Summary
This exploratory study indi cates that a whole systems
approach to self-care support is acceptable to primary
care practices and can be taught in a relatively short
training programme. Previous evidence suggests thatchanging behaviour in consultations is difficult, so work-ing at ways WISE can be adapted and made acceptableto both patients and clinicians is key to the sustainabilityof this approach. In this respect, training peers who nor-mally work together is important as well as acknowled-ging existing ways of working. As a team, we had
specific meetings where the NPT was used to give a
focus to discussions, and this helped us to delineateaspects of the training that needed refining in order to
improve the chances of the WISE approach becoming
embedded in everyday practice. A flexible and sustain-able response by service providers could be enhancedvia the use of a dedicated team of trainers able to dothe training and provide practices with up-to-date and
ongoing information on available self-care support
resources within the PCT.
Some reflections as to the division of labour over self-
c a r es u p p o r tm a ya l s oh a v eu tility for embedding or
changing practice. Clinicians struggle to incorporateself-care support as part of everyday practice, whichmay emanate from indications in this study that attimes GPs see self care as part of the nurses ’role; but
practice nurses work closely to guidelines and targets
for long-term condition management [30]. Thus, self-care support is not at present their main concern duringreview consultations. Self-management is viewed asimportant, but not a priority, and clinicians acknowledgethat they do not necessarily c urrently have the skills to
support patients. For self-care support to become a rou-tine part of primary care practice, one solution may beto incentivise it through QOF to bring it in line with
other tasks and priorities as well as to introduce self-care support training early on in health professionalssocialisation.
The next step is to roll out the training described
here. We are currently developing a ‘train the trainers ’
programme to enable the WISE approach to be used at
a wider level. We will also be testing the effectivenessand cost-effectiveness of the WISE training in a largerandomised controlled trial in one PCT.
