Abstract
Background: The Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) programme is a fall prevention programme
originally taught in a resource-intensive one-to-one format with limited feasibility for large-scale implementation.
The aim of this paper is to present the conceptual framework and initial feasibility evaluation of a group-based LiFE
(gLiFE) format developed for large-scale implementation.
Methods: The conceptual gLiFE framework (part I) is based on three pillars, LiFE Activities and Principles ,Theory
of Behaviour Change and Behaviour Change Techniques , and Instruction . The feasibility of gLiFE was tested (part II)
within a multimodal approach including quantitative questionnaires measuring safety, acceptability (1 = best to
7 = insufficient), and adherence to the LiFE activities (range = 0 –14) as well as a focus group interview. Exploratory
self-reported measures on behaviour change including self-determined motivation (range = 1 –5), intention,
planning, action control, and habit strength (range = 1 –6) were assessed pre and post intervention. Data analyses
were performed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.
Results: The development process resulted in a manualised gLiFE concept containing standardised information
on gLiFE ’s content and structure. Feasibility testing: Six older adults (median = 72.8 years, 5 female) completed the
feasibility study and rated safety (median = 7.0, IQR = 0.3) and acceptability as high (median = 1, IQR = 1). Participants
implemented 9.5 LiFE activities (IQR = 4.0) into their daily routines. No adverse events occurred during the study. In
the focus group, the group format and LiFE activities were perceived as positive and important for maintaining
strength and balance capacity. Self-determined motivation intention, planning, and habit strength were rated
higher post intervention.
Conclusion: The developed conceptual gLiFE framework represents the basis for a gLiFE format with potential
for standardised large-scale implementation. Proof-of-concept could be demonstrated in a group of community-
dwelling older adults at risk of falling. The public health potential of gLiFE in terms of (cost-)effectiveness is
currently being evaluated in a large trial.

Introduction
Since falls display a major health risk factor in our
ageing society [ 1–3], there is a strong need for in-
creasing accessibility to effective fall prevention pro-
grammes. Across different settings, multifactorial
training, such as the combination of balance and
strength exercises have shown to be most effective
in reducing fall rates in older adults [ 4–8]. However,
the“traditional ”delivery of balance and strength ex-
ercises through structured training often entails low
long-term adherence of participants [ 9–11]. Lifestyle-
integrated training was developed as an alternative
approach in order to increase long-term adherence
through embedding functional exercises into daily
life, that is, daily routines are enriched with small
low-intensity bouts of activity with the aim to create
new activity habits [ 12–14]. Lifestyle-integrated
training has already shown positive effects on fall-
related outcomes [ 12,15]. For example, the Lifestyle-
integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) fall prevention
p r o g r a m m eb yC l e m s o ne ta l .[ 16] recorded greater
adherence rates compared to a traditional, structured
training. LiFE resulted in a greater increase in motor
performance, physical activity and a greater decrease
in fall rate compared to the comparator groups.
Despite its high potential, LiFE ’s large-scale imple-
mentability is hampered by its resource-intensive
one-to-one delivery format within seven home visits
[17–19]. A promising solution could be delivering
LiFE in a group format (gLiFE).
Three pilot studies on developing a group-based
LiFE have already been conducted [ 20–23]. These
group-based concepts were not specifically designed
for large-scale implementat ion. For instance, Gibbs
et al. [ 21,22] developed a LiFE concept combining
four group sessions and one individual session. The
individual session aimed tai loring the LiFE activities
to participants ’individual home environments. While
such tailoring is justifiable from a scientific point of
view, the additional reso urces needed conflict with
the aim of cost-efficient large-scale implementation.
The question is whether tailoring LiFE to a home
environment can also be achieved in group sessions,
for instance by applying specific teaching methods
such as visualisation or group discussions about the
individual home environment.
Another study [ 20] used three trainers to imple-
ment group-based LiFE in a sample of 13 young
seniors (59 –61 years). The high trainer-participant-
ratio ensured optimal teaching of the LiFE concept
(including one-to-one consultations during group
sessions) and a high level of safety during exercising.
The high resources needed for this group-based
concept may hamper large-scale implementation.The question is whether specific teaching methods
and optimal organisati on forms may allow for a
lower trainer-participant-r atio, without loss of teach-
ing quality and safety. In summary, even though the
current group approaches provide a valuable scien-
tific contribution, a group LiFE concept for large-
scale implementation needs to be developed and
evaluated.
Important features for a gLiFE concept designed for
resource-saving public health implementation are an
optimised trainer-participant-ratio, implementability
into different settings (e.g., community college, com-
munity centre), and portable low-cost material allow-
ing quick and easy implementation by group trainers.
Further, a standardised trainer ’s manual could provide
comprehensive pathways for teaching both the LiFE
strength and balance activities and behavioural
change. Such manual is fundamental for standardised
large-scale implementation.
Apart from the lack in focus on large-scale imple-
mentability, current group-based LiFE formats [ 20,
24] show room for improving the delivery of behav-
iour change content. The fundamental aspect of long-
term maintenance of the LiFE activities could be
reinforced by emphasising on habit formation. Refine-
ments should be made from a large-scale implementa-
tion perspective and brake down complex behaviour
change theories to comprehensive units. This could
enable cost-efficient teaching of programme content
by providing for the trainers and therapists (e.g.,
physical or occupational therapists) a stronger under-
standing of the psychological underpinnings of the
programme.
The aim of this paper is twofold: to present a
newly developed gLiFE concept focused on large-
scale implementation and building on a sound theor-
etical framework with a stronger focus on behaviour
change (part I) and to present results of an initial
feasibility testing of this new gLiFE concept (part II).
Part I: conceptual framework of gLiFE
The conceptual gLiFE framework was developed
building on existing LiFE concepts [ 20,24]a n dt h e -
ories and methods on group learning. Specific behav-
iour change theories were used to refine the
theoretical framework in order to support long-term
maintenance of LiFE. gLiFE was developed (part I)
and initially tested in a feasibility study described in
this paper (part II). The cost-effectiveness evaluation
of gLiFE within a non-inferiority trial (grant no.
01GL1705A-D) comparing gL iFE to LiFE is currently
being carried out and not described in this paper.
The study protocol is described elsewhere [ 17].Kramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 2 of 18
gLiFE development process
The development process was based on the UK
Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines [ 25]
which propose four steps (development, feasibility and
piloting, evaluation, implementation) for the design of
complex interventions. An interdisciplinary team of
experts in exercise science, health and social psych-
ology, occupational therapy, geriatric medicine,
physiotherapy, health economy, and gerontology took
part in the development of the gLiFE concept. In
addition, 11 users aged 67 to 90 were involved to test
and evaluate possible forms of gLiFE during the de-
velopment process.
Based on previous LiFE studies [ 18,19,24], the
number of seven group sessions and sequence of
gLiFE activities was determined. In order to compen-
sate for a lower trainer-participant-ratio, theories [ 26,
27]a n dm e t h o d s[ 28–32] on group learning informed
the design of the framework conditions including
group size [ 31], organisational setting [ 28]a n ds t r u c -
ture [ 29–31]. The way of instructing gLiFE was in-
formed by the Social Learning Theory [ 27]w h i c h
proposes role models and reinforcement as core ele-
ments of the group learning setting. Through group
activities and discussions, gLiFE fosters group cohe-
sion [ 26] in order to keep participants engaged and
motivate them to practice LiFE.The development process resulted in a manualised
gLiFE concept containing relevant information on con-
tent and structure of each gLiFE session. Table 1pro-
vides an overview of the modifications undertaken in
gLiFE compared to the individually delivered LiFE.
Conceptual gLiFE framework
The conceptual gLiFE framework is based on two main
pillars, LiFE Activities and Principles and Theory of
Behaviour Change and Behaviour Change Techniques
(Fig. 1). The third pillar, Instruction , predefines how the
contents of gLiFE are delivered. The subcategories
Methods ,Organisational Setting , and Materials contain
more detailed information on how to carry out gLiFE.
Pillar I: LiFE activities and principles
The content of the LiFE programme, the LiFE activities
and principles from Clemson et al. [ 16,33] were used as
a foundation for gLiFE. LiFE contains 14 activities
addressing static and dynamic balance, lower limb
strength, and overall physical activity. These activities
are effective for the target group of fall-prone older
adults but at the same time performable during daily
activities. Teaching the LiFE principles (Fig. 1) alongside
the LiFE activities enables participants to integrate the
activities into their daily routines and manage their
training independently and sustainably [ 24].

In LiFE, there is no predefined order along which the
LiFE activities should be introduced. Experiences from
the user involvement showed that teaching the LiFE ac-
tivities to a group requires a different approach. There-
fore, a standardised order of introducing LiFE activities
over the course of the seven sessions was developed
(Fig. 2). The order of LiFE activities was determined
based on user preferences evaluated in a previous study
[19]. In gLiFE, the most popular LiFE activities which
are easy to integrate (e.g., sit to stand) are introduced
during the first group sessions. More complex activities
(e.g., stepping sideways) and more challenging activities
(e.g., one-leg stand) are introduced later. Gradually
increasing the complexity of content taught over the
course of the group sessions aims to prevent overtaxing
participants and ensures positive learning experiences.Pillar II: theory of behaviour change and behaviour change
techniques
LiFE goes beyond traditional fall prevention pro-
grammes; it aims for the establishment of new move-
ment habits through integrating exercises into daily
routines [ 24]. The theoretical underpinning of gLiFE was
formed using the existing conceptual model of LiFE [ 24,
33], habit formation theory [ 34,35], and the pilot study
of Fleig et al. [ 20] which used the Health Action Process
Approach (HAPA) [ 36,37]. Additionally, we used the
Self-Determination Theory [ 38].
Habit formation theory describes the habit formation
process within three subsequent stages: intention forma-
tion, action initiation and habit formation [ 39]. After
deciding to act, a person needs to apply self-regulatory
strategies in order to act out the behaviour. After variousFig. 1 Conceptual gLiFE framework. The first pillar LiFE Activities and Principles is based on the original LiFE activities and principles which are
“reducing your base of support ”,“shifting weight and moving to the limits of stability ”,“stepping over objects ”[33] for balance and “increase the
number of times that you use a muscle ”,“move slowly –this can make the muscles work harder ”,“use fewer muscles to move the same weight ”,
and “increase the amount of weight you have to lift or move ”[33] for strength. The second pillar Theory of Behaviour Change and Behaviour
Change Techniques is novel to gLiFE and provides a theoretical underpinning using the Health Action Process Approach, habit formation theory,
and Self-Determination Theory as well as a conceptualisation and description of gLiFE ’s components with the help of the BCTs. The third pillar
Instruction consists of methods, organisational setting and materials and describes the way of delivering gLiFE. In the manualised gLiFE concept, a
detailed curriculum is provided in order to teach gLiFE in a standardised mannerKramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 4 of 18
repetitions of the behaviour in the same context, the asso-
ciation between the context and the behaviour strengthens
until the execution becomes automatic (habitual). gLiFE
makes use of this mechanism so that participants perform
the LiFE activities habitually in the long run.
The HAPA served to enrich habit formation theory be-
cause of its emphasis on the motivational and volitional
factors during behaviour change. These factors are par-
ticularly relevant during the early stage of behaviour
change and could provide additional support for
beginners. For example, the planning procedure was spe-
cified by using implementation intentions [ 40]. Instead of
stating how, when and where to perform the LiFE activity,
participants explicitly formulate a whole sentence in which
the situational cue is followed by the LiFE activity (e.g., "If
I brush my teeth, then I do the tandem stand"). This nov-
elty may promote habit formation better since entering
the situation could bring the LiFE activity into mind auto-
matically. Next to habits, intrinsic motivation is another
beneficial factor for long-term maintenance physical activ-
ity behaviour [ 41]. Self-Determination Theory [ 38]p r o -
poses intrinsic motivation to arise alongside the fulfilment
of three psychological needs, autonomy, competence, and
connectedness. gLiFE fosters these needs through self-empowering participants to manage their training inde-
pendently and become their own LiFE trainer. In contrast
to LiFE, gLiFE has the potential to foster connectedness
particularly through the presence of peers.
The LiFE programme already used the habit formation
theory, and while participants' action plans were devised
to incorporate elements of habit reforming, it was only
taught to trainers not participants. However, increasing
participants ’awareness on the psychological factors
which can promote behaviour change may increase
intervention success. Therefore, the Behaviour Change
Technique (BCT) Taxonomy v1 [ 42] was applied to map
the used theories into intervention practice and short
theoretical units of 10 –15 min length (Fig. 2). This step
is essential for large-scale implementation because it en-
ables facilitators without special training in psychology
to teach complex theoretical concepts.
The BCTs drawn from Fleig et al. [ 20] were revised
and adapted to the gLiFE concept and the novel con-
tents were categorised by two of the authors (SL, LF).
Next to the LiFE-inherent BCTs (e.g., demonstration of
the behaviour, BCT 6.1.; behavioural practice/rehearsal,
BCT 8.1.), social reward (BCT 10.4.) was added to pro-
mote habit formation through positive reinforcement in
Fig. 2 (a)t o(g) refer to the chronological introduction of categories in the text. The LiFE Activities and Principles (pillar I in the conceptual gLiFE
framework) are addressed in section ( a), (b), and ( e). Theory of Behaviour Change (pillar II) is addressed in section ( d) and Behaviour Change
Techniques (pillar II) infuse all gLiFE sessions. gLiFE contents are matched with the BCTs in Table 5in Appendix 1Kramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 5 of 18
the group setting. Information about health conse-
quences (BCT 5.1.) was added to foster positive outcome
expectancies. A detailed form of delivery [ 43] of all
applied BCTs and their link to the used theories is
described in Table 5inAppendix 1.
Pillar III: instruction
A transparent description of how to teach LiFE in a
group setting aims to facilitate dissemination of gLiFE
and ensures intervention fidelity. Determining methodo-
logical standards is essential to streamline content and
delivery of gLiFE.
The gLiFE framework draws on experiences and theor-
ies from previous studies [ 19,20,23,33] refined and
upgraded for our purposes. Teaching methods aimed to
deliver the two main pillars of gLiFE as effective as pos-
sible in a group setting. For the purpose of large-scale
implementation, gLiFE is designed for any room
equipped with chairs. Instruction includes the following
subcategories: methods, organisational setting, and
applied materials (Fig. 1).
Methods gLiFE was conceptualised for groups of up to
12 participants following recommendations on group
size [ 31] and previous group-based LiFE pilot studies
[23]. Based on group simulations and findings from Li
and colleagues [ 23], we considered two trainers —one
main and one co-trainer —as necessary for effective de-
livery and safety. The main trainer explains and demon-
strates the theoretical and practical content, leads group
discussions, and acts as the main contact person for par-
ticipants. The co-trainer demonstrates and corrects the
activities, documents, helps to shape in discussions, and
ensures safety and support, particularly for functionally
impaired participants.
Each gLiFE session follows a predefined order which is
listed in Fig. 2.
To teach the LiFE activities and the behaviour change
theory in the group setting, (motor) learning principles
such as structuring and progression [44] (BCT 8.7.
graded tasks), repetition and variation [44] (BCT 8.1. be-
havioural practice/rehearsal), and clarity [45] (BCT 4.1.
instruction on how to perform the behaviour) are ap-
plied. Structuring and progression is based on established
learning guidelines and methods such as from easy to
difficult [29,30]. For example, stepping over objects is
first taught with a flat piece of paper on the floor in
order to prevent slips or trips, later on with a cardboard
box in order to simulate a real obstacle. The principle
repetition and variation includes a repetition of previous
LiFE activities.
Based on motor learning theory, trainers use a deduct-
ive approach for introducing the LiFE activities [ 29,46],
i.e., predefined and detailed instructions to ensure acorrect movement execution of the LiFE activities (BCT
2.2. feedback on behaviour). Several teaching techniques
including frontal teaching (BCT 9.1. credible source),
group discussions, open questions, and group work [ 47]
are employed in order to teach gLiFE effectively (Table 5
inAppendix 1).
The second pillar is taught using specific methods
such as a flipchart to collect participants ’suggestions for
daily situations to implement the LiFE activities.
Through the presence of peers, participants get a larger
repertoire of potential daily situations and are able to
support each other in programme implementation. To
compensate for the missing home visits, participants
visualise themselves performing specific LiFE activities
in their home environment (BCT 15.2. mental rehearsal
of successful performance). Visualisation as a mental
technique [ 48] has been applied in LiFE [ 33] and was
successfully used in previous physical activity inter-
ventions [ 49,50] and has been positively evaluated in a
meta-analysis [ 51].
Organisational setting State-of-the art organisational
forms for group teaching and group exercising [ 28]w e r e
chosen to facilitate communication of group members
and trainers while ensuring safety during exercising (Table
6inAppendix 2). This includes a circle of chairs with all
participants and trainers facing each other. Chairs allow
hold and support if needed. Specific organisational
settings are used for specific activities (Table 6in
Appendix 2). For instance, for teaching the activity “walk-
ing on toes ”, participants walk along a wall. This type of
practice can easily be transferred to the home environ-
ment, e.g., walking in a hallway, with a high level of safety.
Materials The original materials of LiFE such as the
LiFE assessment tool, activity planner, and activity
counter [ 33] served as a basis for the design of the gLiFE
materials (Table 1). Participants receive a workbook con-
taining a modified activity planner which simplifies the
planning and self-monitoring procedure (BCT 2.3. self-
monitoring of behaviour). It combines the activity plan-
ner with the activity counter because the paperwork has
been reported to be tedious in former studies [ 18,20,
23]. Since the LiFE activities are identical in LiFE and
gLiFE, participants receive the German version of the
LiFE participant's manual [ 52].
In addition, specific materials for teaching LiFE in a
group were developed such as a poster with the LiFE
principles, posters displaying the different LiFE activities
as well as different aids for practicing the correct move-
ment execution (e.g., a poster with a kitchen shelf which
we attached to the wall to practice standing on toes).
The ideas from the group discussions are collected on
flipchart.Kramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 6 of 18
Methods
Part II: feasibility testing
A feasibility study ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03412123)
was conducted to test the proof-of-concept of gLiFE.
This included an evaluation of the three pillars of the
gLiFE concept, i.e., the LiFE activities (pillar I), a pre-
post assessment of psychological components related
to behaviour change (pillar II) and gLiFE ’si n s t r u c t i o n
(pillar III).
Design and setting
A single-group feasibility study was conducted from
January to March 2018, including seven weekly gLiFE
sessions. A multimodal pre-post assessment approach
including quantitative and qualitative feasibility mea-
sures as well as exploratory self-reported psychosocial
measures was applied.
Population
A sample of eight community-dwellers aged 65 years
and older was envisaged. They were recruited from a list
of former participants of studies conducted at the Net-
work Aging Research in the field of ageing and physical
activity. To avoid interferences with our study, we chose
participants whose former study participations were at
least more than 6 months ago. Eligible participants had
to be able to reach the study centre independently and
willing to sign written informed consent. Those with an
unstable or terminal medical condition, cognitive im-
pairment according to the CogTel questionnaire [ 53], or
severe visual or hearing impairment were excluded.
Procedure
Baseline characteristics and outcome measures were
assessed prior to group participation at the Network
Aging Research (Heidelberg University, Germany). One
week before the first group session, participants received
the LiFE participant's manual [ 52]. The gLiFE sessions
were delivered in accordance with the developed gLiFE
concept (Fig. 2) by an exercise scientist as main trainer
(FK) and a psychologist (SL) as co-trainer. The duration
of gLiFE sessions ranged from 1.5 to 2 hours. After
the intervention phase, outcome measures were
obtained.
Descriptive measures
Participant characteristics including sex, age, BMI, edu-
cational level (highest degree of education), physical ac-
tivity status (below or above 150 min of moderate to
vigorous activity per week in the past 12 months [ 54]),
pain level in the past 4 weeks (6-point Likert scale, no
pain to very high pain), impact of pain on activities of
daily living, fall history in the past 12 months, fallinjuries, perceived fall risk (below average to above aver-
age), number of comorbidities, and functional strength
(5-chair-rise test [ 55]) and balance (8-level balance scale
[16]) were assessed at baseline.
Outcome measures
The outcome measures included quantitative and quali-
tative feasibility measures.
Quantitative feasibility measures
The following quantitative outcomes were assessed using
a questionnaire previously developed for evaluating
LiFE [ 19].
Perceived safety and adverse events Participants rated
their perceived feeling of safety during the execution of
LiFE activities on a 7-point Likert scale. Participants
documented adverse events including pain, falls, and
injuries during the intervention phase.
Adherence We assessed the average number of partici-
pants per session. Based on other LiFE studies [ 19], par-
ticipants reported the number of their implemented
LiFE activities and weekly frequency of practice as an
additional measure of adherence.
Acceptability Participants rated the overall acceptability
of gLiFE from 1 (very good) to 6 (insufficient); one ques-
tion on whether the participants would recommend
gLiFE to a friend (yes/no); participants rated (a) the per-
ceived helpfulness of LiFE activities for improving bal-
ance, strength, and physical activity; (b) the perceived
difficulty of LiFE activities and of upgrading; and (c) the
implementability into daily life on a 7-point Likert scale
from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much).
Qualitative feasibility measures
A semi-structured focus group interview was conducted
to gather further information about structure and con-
tent of gLiFE, competence of trainers, used materials,
implementation of the LiFE activities and ideas for im-
proving gLiFE. The focus group was administered by an
independent researcher not involved in the intervention.
Exploratory self-reported psychosocial measures on
behaviour change
To get an initial indication on the psychological
processes related to behaviour change in gLiFE, selected
variables were assessed prior to and post intervention.
Response formats of the applied questionnaires were 6-
point Likert scales ranging from 1 (completely disagree)
to 6 (totally agree), unless stated differently.Kramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 7 of 18
Intention to practice the LiFE activities and to realise
an active lifestyle was assessed using two items
(Table 2).
Self-determined exercise motivation was assessed using
the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire
(BRE-Q3 [ 56]). The questionnaire consists of 24 items
measuring six different motivational qualities with four
items ranging from 0 (does not apply to me at all) to 4
(totally applies to me). The Relative Autonomy Index
(RAI) is a weighted score indicating the level of self-
determined motivation. Higher scores indicate higher
self-determined motivation.
Action and coping planning was assessed using four
items according to Sniehotta et al. [ 57] which were
adapted to study purposes.
Action control was assessed using two items according
to Sniehotta et al. [ 57].
Habit strength was assessed using four items of the
Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index [ 58]. The
four items were adapted to the LiFE activities, e.g., “The
LiFE activities are something I do automatically ”.
Data analysis
Participant characteristics are reported as number of
participants ( N), percentage (%), median, and inter-
quartile range (IQR), as appropriate. Number of imple-
mented LiFE activities and frequency of practice are
also reported as median and IQR. Likert scale ques-
tionnaires are reported as median and IQR. We used
SPSS 24.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) to calculate
descriptive results. Focus group recordings were tran-
scribed and subsequently analysed using an inductive
qualitative content analysis [ 59]. Two authors (FK, SL)
independently familiarised themselves with the inter-
views and built three categories in three subsequent
steps. The authors agreed on a set of codes and
applied them to the whole manuscript. Subsequently,
both authors created a coding network using NVivo11
(QRS International, Australia).Results
Seven participants were willing to take part in the study;
one participant withdrew due to health problems, six
participants (median = 72.8, IQR = 2.8, 5 female) com-
pleted the intervention (for the flow diagram, see Fig. 3
inAppendix 3). The sample was heterogeneous with re-
spect to education level, physical activity level, perceived
pain, fall history, and comorbidities (Table 3). Partici-
pants reported to perceive their risk of falling as being
average compared to other persons their sex and age.
However, according to the cut-off values for functional
strength measured by the 5-chair-rise test [ 60], our
sample had a high risk of falling. Participants ’balance
measured by the 8-level balance scale is comparable to
previous studies [ 16]. Participants did not report any
major acute health conditions.
Implementation of the gLiFE intervention
gLiFE was delivered as planned including structure
of each group session (part I, Fig. 2). Trainers per-
ceived the lower trainer-par ticipant-ratio as feasible
and safe. Applied teaching techniques and
organisational settings could be carried out as
intended (part I, Table 5in Appendix 1 and Table 6
inAppendix 2). Switching organisational forms was
uncomplicated. However, finding individual training
levels for all participants using the LiFE assessment
tool in group setting was challenging because
trainers had to rate and su pervise all participants
simultaneously. Documentation of action plans (imple-
mentation intentions) with the help of the modified
activity planner worked well in the group setting. Trainers
perceived the designed low-cost material such as card
boxes for stepping over objects as helpful and safe.
Quantitative feasibility measures
The majority of participants reported they felt “very
safe”while performing the LiFE activities (Table 4).
No adverse events were reported. On average, five
out of six participants attended each session. Most of

the participants reported that they had implemented more
than half of the LiFE activities over the course of the
programme for 5 days per week (Table 4). Overall accept-
ability of gLiFE was “very good ”and everyone would have
recommended it to a friend. Participants rated gLiFE as
(a)“helpful ”for improving balance, strength, and physical
activity; (b) “low”with respect to perceived difficulty and
upgrading of the LiFE activities; and (c) “rather easy ”to
implement into daily life (Table 4).
Qualitative feasibility measures
Five of six participants took part in the semi-
structured interview; one participant cancelled due to
illness. Qualitative content analysis resulted in threecategories: Format ,Implementation of Activities ,a n d
Perceived Intervention Effects . Format refers to partici-
pants ’opinions on the group setting, safety, trainers,
materials, and LiFE activities as well as their delivery;
implementation of activities refers to habit formation
and cues/prompts to which the LiFE activities can be
linked; perceived intervention effects refers to physio-
logical and psychosocial changes related to LiFE.
Format
Group setting Participants reported that the atmos-
phere within the group was “very good ”(female, aged
73). Participants “felt very comfortable, also with the
trainers ”(female, aged 70). One participant would have
preferred a larger group size. One participant “found it
nice to get to know the activities in the group setting. It
showed that being a ‘lone warrior ’is not as effective and
motivating as being in a group ”(female, aged 68).
Safety In line with the quantitative results, participants
reported they felt very safe during the gLiFE sessions.
The trainer-participant-ratio was perceived as “good ”
(female, aged 68) and participants reported they felt safe
“having both trainers on [their] side ”(female, aged 73).
Delivery of gLiFE content It was stated that the gLiFE
sessions had a “good and systematic structure ”(fe-
male, aged 73) and that the structure was “enjoyable
and thoughtful ”(female, aged 73). One participant
remarked that “the balance between theory and prac-
tice was suitable and appropriate for [their] age ”(fe-
male, aged 78). Participants found the repetition of
LiFE activities in the beginning of each session was
necessary and useful ( “I found the repetitions very
nice and I recognised whether I had done the exer-
cises correctly or not ”, female, aged 70) and that vi-
sualisation were a helpful strategy for embedding the
LiFE activities into daily routines. Participants empha-
sised that the movement corrections were “support-
ive”(female, aged 73), and “important ”(female, aged
73); one-to-one corrections were appreciated ( “It has
been implicitly corrected without anyone being exposed
to the group ”, female, aged 78).
LiFE activities Participants reported they felt highly au-
tonomous in choosing their LiFE activities ( “I can
choose those activities for myself which are effective for
me and I can benefit from them, because I have a high
risk of falling ”, female, aged 78).

aid next to the explanations during sessions ( “If I didn ’tTable 3 Descriptive characteristics of the study population ( N=6 )

the manual and looked it up ”, female, aged 68). In
contrast, participants reported that working with the
activity planner was too complex and unhandy ( “I only
used it at the beginning, that was too cumbersome and
complex for me ”, female, aged 70).
Implementation of LiFE activities
Habit formation Participants valued action planning as
a central and helpful element for the implementation of
the LiFE activities into daily life ( “Planning in which
daily situation I execute the LiFE activities helped me to
carrying out the activities [ …]. They remind me of
doing the exercises in these situations ”, female, aged 70).
Participants described daily routines in which they could
“implement the one or the other LiFE activity the whole
day”(female, aged 73). Participants remarked that some
new movement habits arose during intervention phase
(“I do certain LiFE activities every morning and evening
in the bathroom ”, female, aged 70).
Cues/prompts Participants described that situational
cues were helpful to remember performing the LiFE ac-
tivities ( “That makes a lot of sense and it is good for
reminding, it caused a wow-effect ”, female, aged 68).
However, some participants remarked that they did not
always perform the LiFE activities in the situation they
chose during gLiFE sessions ( “I did not do it in specific
situations. Sometimes I just did it when it occurred to
me”, female, aged 70).Perceived intervention effects
Physiological effects Some participants described
reduced pain related to gLiFE participation. In contrast,
one participant “[…] felt pain while standing up from a
seated position and walking on heels ”(female, aged 70).
One participant at high risk of falling remarked that she
felt“much safer while walking on the street. [She] did
not fall since Christmas, [She was] really proud of [her]-
self”(female, aged 78).
Psychosocial effects Participants stated that taking
part in gLiFE evoked a feeling of fitness, vitality, and
a general sense of well-being: “The LiFE activities
[were] very helpful. I really feel a sense of well-being
in my body. I feel more relaxed, relieved and less or
no more pain ”(female, aged 73). All participants
planned to continue LiFE because of its relevance and
necessity ( “It would be stupid not to continue with
the LiFE activities. I would only harm myself ”, female,
aged 78).
Exploratory self-reported measures on behaviour change
Descriptive results showed that intention to follow an
active lifestyle stayed high, whereas self-determined mo-
tivation measured by the RAI increased during interven-
tion phase, which may suggest higher levels of intrinsic
motivation after gLiFE than before (Table 2). Action and
coping planning and habit strength slightly increased
over the course of the intervention whereas action con-
trol decreased.Table 4 Quantitative results of the feasibility study ( N=6 )

Discussion
We successfully achieved our study aims in terms of
developing (part I) and initially testing (part II) a new
gLiFE concept designed for large-scale implementation.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gLiFE
concept specifically tailored towards the purpose of a
resource-saving dissemination within public health
approaches.
Part I: Development of the gLiFE concept
Building on previous group-based LiFE concepts, our
proposed gLiFE concept has several novel features with
respect to large-scale implementation including lower
trainer-participant-ratio, flexible implementability into
different settings, low-cost materials, and a manualised
concept designed to standardise structure of content and
teaching procedure. We used the established MRC
guidelines for developing the gLiFE concept. There are
also other frameworks, such as FRAME [ 61] in order to
refine interventions which could be used in further
studies.
Development process
The MRC guidelines recommend an iterative ap-
proach including multiple improvement cycles when
developing complex interve ntions. Having involved
users at an early stage of the gLiFE development
process allowed us to test initial ideas on the organ-
isational setting and teaching process. Experiences
from the user involvement formed the basis for the
further development of gLiFE and were discussed in
the interdisciplinary team.
One home visit in addition to the group sessions was
discussed as an added value to foster efficient implemen-
tation of the LiFE activities into daily life but then
dismissed due to the required additional costs and
resources.
Another feature of gLiFE in favour of cost-
effectiveness is the decreased trainer-participant-ratio.
Other studies provide evidence for the feasibility of
two trainers for a group size of up to 12 older adults
[23]. However, less trainer support also poses a
potential lack of safety for fall-prone older adults.
Therefore, special focus was given to standardised
safety guidelines for gLiFE practice. Using chairs and
room walls for an additional base of support proved
feasible in our study; special and costly equipment
such as parallel bars turned out unnecessary. Two
trainers were sufficient for delivering gLiFE safely.
Next to reducing costs, we aimed to boost gLiFE ’s ef-
fectiveness. The application of established theories on
group learning helped to compensate for the fact that a
simple blueprint of the LiFE is not feasible for the group
setting. However, the group setting offers severalopportunities such as role modelling [ 27] or social sup-
port which are not present in a one-to-one scenario. In
gLiFE, we explicitly made use of group dynamics
through implementing group discussions and partner
exercises in order to foster the learning process.
Moreover, we used special materials and teaching
techniques to ensure the transferability of the LiFE
activities from the group setting into participants ’
daily lives. For instance, a poster displaying a kitchen
shelf allowed to practice L iFE with relation to com-
mon furniture and the respective daily situation (e.g.,
pick something from a shelf). We know that these
features seem quite simple and may not solely facili-
tate successful transfer, which is why we intensified
the already existing teaching techniques such as
visualisation and intensively discussed possible daily
situations with the group.
In summary, during the development process, we
made various trade-offs to ensure gLiFE ’sc o s t -
effectiveness. The interdisciplinary discourse resulted
in a gLiFE concept which contains the core ele-
ments of LiFE while having the potential for large-
scale implementation. Whether this resource-saving
format proves to be similarly effective but less costly
compared to LiFE is currently evaluated in a large
trial [ 17].
Conceptual gLiFE framework
We optimised the theoretical framework in terms of
structure and content in order to increase gLiFE ’s
long-term effectiveness on basis of current scientific
evidence. The first pillar LiFE Activities and Prin-
ciples was maintained, whereas the concept of how
to introduce the LiFE activities has been revised.
Introducing the LiFE activities gradually and repeat-
ing the LiFE activities in the subsequent session
allows participants to familiarise themselves with the
LiFE activities and test them in daily situations
between sessions.
The second pillar Theory of Behaviour Change and
Behaviour Change Techniques shall ensure the sus-
tainable implementation of LiFE. Theories such as
the HAPA or the Self-Determination Theory were
not only used to design the theoretical units, but
also provided a basis for the teaching aim. For
example, participants ’competence was fostered
through teaching the LiFE principles and emphasising the
reasoning behind the importance of situational cues
to the participants in order to create new movement
habits. Using implementation intentions to link the
daily situation to one specific LiFE activity, as in the
original LiFE programme, seems to be a promising
tool to boost habit formation.Kramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 11 of 18
In contrast to former studies [ 20] which did not pro-
vide specific information on instructing a group-based
LiFE format, our manualised gLiFE concept ensures
standardised dissemination in a variety of public health
settings and improves replicability in scientific studies.
Furthermore, gLiFE entails a comprehensive description
of the contents on behaviour change and the BCTs and
thereby allows their standardised application. Providing
trainers with limited psychological background with pre-
pared information on long-term behaviour change might
increase gLiFE ’s success.
In summary, the new conceptual gLiFE framework
not only offers a profound theoretical basis which
can be tested in scientific settings, but also provides
detailed information on instructing gLiFE which may
help to implement gLiFE on a large-scale.
Part II: Feasibility testing
The gLiFE feasibility testing was carried out as planned.
Qualitative and quantitative outcomes obtained via
multimodal evaluation suggest that gLiFE is feasible and
well-accepted in the target group. Findings are in line
with previous studies in young female seniors (mean age
66 years) [ 20]. We demonstrated that the gLiFE concept
is also feasible and accepted in an older sample includ-
ing individuals at risk of falling and functional impair-
ment who display the key target group of LiFE. Our
gLiFE concept could be a resource-saving alternative to
LiFE feasible for large-scale implementation.
Quantitative feasibility measures
We used established quantitative measures in order to
judge the core elements of gLiFE ’s feasibility. The fact that
gLiFE was generally highly accepted by participants is in
line with other LiFE studies [ 16,21] and suggests that it is
well-suited for the needs and capabilities of the target
group. The high attendance rates mirror this finding.
Ensuring safety is one fundamental aspect of feasibility.
At the same time, effective balance training requires par-
ticipants to practice close to their stability limits (over-
load principle [ 62]) which has risk-potential in a group
of fall-prone older adults. Our developed structure to
teach LiFE activities in the group (e.g., two trainers and
specific organisational settings) may explain participants ’
feelings of safety expressed during the evaluation. The
assumption of gLiFE being safe is supported by the fact
that no adverse events occurred during group sessions.
Likewise, participants did not report any adverse events
while practicing the LiFE activities in everyday life, sug-
gesting that participants understood the recommenda-
tion for practicing LiFE safely.
The key element of the gLiFE concept are the 14
LiFE activities of which participants may include asmany as they like. In the case of lifestyle-integrated
training, the number of LiFE activities implemented is
both an adherence measure and a marker for behav-
iour, because the main aim is that participants prac-
tice at home independently. The fact that most
participants implemented around 75% of LiFE acti-
vities is in line with their reported low difficulty of
implementing LiFE activities into daily situations. Our
finding is comparable to adherence rates from previ-
ous studies (76%) implementing LiFE after a one-to-
one delivery [ 19] and measuring adherence in the
same manner. This implies that gLiFE facilitates the
transfer of LiFE activities from the group setting into
daily life. Likewise, the frequency of practicing LiFE —
which is highly dependent on the daily situations the
activity is liked to —is comparable to previous LiFE
studies [ 12]. This suggests that brainstorming daily
situations together via group discussions might be as
useful as doing it one-to-one.
In summary, quantitative data suggests that the
developed gLiFE concept may be as feasible as LiFE. A
direct comparison between LiFE and gLiFE in future
studies will clarify if one format is more or less effective.
Qualitative feasibility measures
Participants ’positive feedback about the group setting
and atmosphere in the focus group suggest that a peer
group might be beneficial for evoking feelings of com-
fort, joy, and motivation [ 63–65]. The perceived high
safety level during sessions is in line with previous
studies [ 23].
The positive feedback about structure, content, and
distribution suggests that the gLiFE concept is suit-
able for the target group. The reported high degree
of autonomy when choosing and implementing indi-
vidual LiFE activities suggests that the gLiFE concept
empowered participants to manage their LiFE training
independently.
The perceived helpfulness of action planning and
identification of situational cues indicates that partici-
pants understood these two features to be crucial for
habit formation and long-term success with LiFE. The
fact that some LiFE activities already became habitual
after the intervention phase of 7 weeks supports that
raising the importance of habit formation in the the-
oretical basis (pillar II) is a promising approach for
promoting long-term behaviour change. However,
some participants reported to perform the LiFE activ-
ities independent of their chosen specific daily situ-
ation. This might hamper habit formation because
repeating the action in the same context is considered
essential [ 35,66,67].
The decrease in overall pain and the increase in
general feelings of fitness and self-efficacy afterKramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 12 of 18
gLiFE suggest that gLiFE may not only have an
impact on functional status but might also be benefi-
cial regarding overall well-being. These findings are
in line with previous studies [ 16,21,65], especially
the effects of LiFE on psychosocial factors display an
interesting topic for further research.
Exploratory self-reported measures on behaviour change
The fact that the intention stayed high over the course
of the intervention suggests that participants kept their
aim of being active until after intervention. However, a
large gap between the intention to engage in physical
activity and real physical activity behaviour has been
observed [ 68], which is why intention should not be con-
sidered the only predictor for physical activity behaviour.
Studies found evidence for self-regulatory strategies be-
ing capable of bridging this “intention-behaviour gap ”in
the physical activity domain [ 69].
The descriptive increase of self-determined moti-
vation may support the assumption that gLiFE fos-
ters autonomy and thereby fosters self-determined
motivation [ 38] which could contribute to long-term
maintenance of the LiFE activities.
The descriptive increase of action planning suggests
that participants made use o f implementation inten-
tions in order to plan when and where they would
implement the LiFE activities into their daily routines.
Even though no conclusions can be drawn on these
descriptive findings, they can be interpreted as an ini-
tial indicator for a successful application of imple-
mentation intentions. Other studies did not evaluate
the use of implementation intentions particularly, but
found planning interventions to be highly useful for
the LiFE context [ 16,20] as well as for the formation
of physical activity habits [ 70,71].
The descriptive increase of habit strength after 7 weeks
of practice suggests that habit formation was successful
in this small sample. This finding is in line with another
group-based LiFE pilot study [ 20] and other studies
investigating habit formation in the health behaviour
context [ 34].
Limitations
In line with the MRC guidelines, this initial feasibility
study demonstrates the proof-of-concept of the newly
developed gLiFE concept. Large-scale implementability
and cost-effectiveness could not be evaluated yet, but
a large study building on the present one is currently
being carried out [ 17].
A core element for intervention implementation is
fidelity [ 72]. In this pilot study, trainers reported
that intervention implementation was successful, but
we did not systematically assess fidelity based on a
specific methodology, as this would have requiredadditional resources [ 21,22], which were not avail-
able in the LiFE-is-LiFE project [ 17]. Fidelity is cer-
tainly a key aspect in larger studies evaluating the
gLiFE concept.
The small and selected sample hampers a general-
isation of findings. Even though a researcher un-
known by participants conducted the focus group, a
potential report bias cannot be excluded, as our
participants were specifically interested in research
project participation. Furt her, social desirability [ 73]
might have biassed participants ’critical feedback on
gLiFE. One-to-one interv iews could have revealed
more specific information on participants ’opinions.
Despite our effort to simplify the activity planner,
some participants still found it complex to handle. This
may display a general limitation of paper-pencil-based
materials related to LiFE. An ICT-based solution could
be a promising alternative [ 18]. Further, the question re-
mains whether the documentation critique is truly re-
lated to the paperwork or a general issue related to
behaviour change (i.e., action control).
Future research
After the development (part I) and initial feasibility test-
ing (part II), the next step is evaluating gLiFE ‘s cost-
effectiveness and large-scale implementability. In the
currently running LiFE-is-LiFE trial, we evaluate these
aspects including quantitative and qualitative outcomes
on participants ’experiences with gLiFE (e.g., group size,
organisational setting, and materials), adherence to LiFE
post intervention and behaviour change outcomes
such as self-determined motivation and habit forma-
tion [ 17].
Conclusion
This concept paper presents the development (part I)
and initial feasibility testing (part II) of a novel gLiFE
concept for community-dwelling older adults at risk of
falling. According to the MRC framework, these first
two steps are crucial for achieving high quality of com-
plex interventions. The greatest innovation of our study
is the first standardised version of a group LiFE concept,
including a manual on its conduct. gLiFE is based on a
theoretical framework and was specifically designed for
large-scale implementation. The successfully completed
MRC-based development process in combination with
the positive results of the feasibility study demonstrates
the proof-of-concept of our approach and justifies
proceeding to MRC part III (evaluating gLiFE ’s
effectiveness). If gLiFE proves itself as effective as or
nearly as effective as LiFE, a wide-spread dissemination
of gLiFE into public health settings can be advised, fos-
tering older adults ’long-term adherence to fall
prevention.Kramer et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:6 Page 13 of 18

Authors ’contributions
The gLiFE concept was designed by FK, SL, CPJ, CN, LC, and MS with input
from all other authors. MS and CB developed the grant proposal for the
LiFE-is-LiFE trial approved for funding. FK, SL, and CPJ conducted the
feasibility testing leading data collection and analysis. FK and SL produced
