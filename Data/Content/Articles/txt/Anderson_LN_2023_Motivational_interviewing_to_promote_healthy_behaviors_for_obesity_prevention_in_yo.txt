Abstract 
Background Obesity is a chronic disease and is an established risk factor for other chronic diseases and mortality. 
Young adulthood is a period when people may be highly amenable to healthy behavior change, develop lifelong 
healthy behaviors, and when primary prevention of obesity may be feasible. Interventions in early adulthood have 
the potential for primary or primordial prevention (i.e., preventing risk factors before disease onset). The primary 
objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of a 6‑month behavioral and educational intervention to promote 
healthy behaviors for obesity prevention among young adults.
Methods This is the study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial. Young adults (age 18–29) attending 
McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention or control. The 
intervention will include individual motivational interviewing sessions (online or in‑person) with a trained interviewer 
plus educational materials (based on Canada’s food guide and physical activity recommendations). The control group 
will receive educational materials only. The primary feasibility outcomes that will be evaluated as part of this pilot 
study include enrollment, retention (≥ 80%), data completion (≥ 80% of weights measured, and surveys completed), 
and participant satisfaction. Secondary clinical outcomes will include body mass index (BMI) change from baseline 
to 6 months, physical activity, nutrition risk, health‑related quality of life mental health, and economic outcomes. Out ‑
comes will be measured remotely using activity trackers, and online questionnaires at baseline and every 2 months. 
Risk stratification will be applied at baseline to identify participants at high risk of obesity (e.g., due to family or per ‑
sonal history). Exit questionnaires will collect data on how participants felt about the study and cost analysis will be 
conducted.
Discussion Our pilot randomized controlled trial will evaluate the feasibility of an obesity prevention interven‑
tion in early adulthood and will inform future larger studies for obesity prevention. The results of this study have 
the potential to directly contribute to the primary prevention of several types of cancer by testing an intervention 
that could be scalable to public health, post ‑secondary education, or primary care settings.

Background
Obesity is a chronic disease, and it is also a risk factor 
for other chronic diseases. In Canada, the prevalence of 
obesity among adults was 28% in 2018 [1, 2]. It has been 
estimated that the direct costs of overweight and obesity 
in Canada were $6 billion annually in 2006 [3]. By 2025 
approximately 20% of adults worldwide will have obesity.
[4] Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 
with classes of obesity severity defined as Class 1 (30–34), 
Class 2 (35–39), and Class 3 (≥ 40) [5]. Although there 
are limitations in the use of BMI cut points to define obe -
sity, BMI is strongly correlated with body fat and remains 
the most practical measure for population-based studies 
[6, 7]. Obesity severity is important, with more severe 
obesity conferring a substantially greater risk of cancer, 
other chronic conditions, and poor mental health [8–10]. 
Obesity is a complex disease with a broad range of socio-
ecological risk factors. Obesity treatment is challenging, 
and primary and secondary prevention interventions are 
urgently needed to reduce the incidence of obesity and 
decrease or maintain obesity severity [11].
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on 
activities of daily life, and many causes of weight gain, 
including chronic stress and physical inactivity, increased 
during the pandemic. Early indications suggest that 
20–48% of people reported weight gain during the pan -
demic [12–19]. Some reasons include changes in food 
intake (increased food insecurity and consumption of 
“comfort” foods), decreased physical activity, increased 
sedentary time, and increased alcohol. There is some evi -
dence of sex differences (greater weight gain in women) 
and increased weight gain among people with higher 
BMI pre-pandemic [12, 13]. One small US study found 
that pandemic shelter-in-place orders were associated 
with an average weight gain of 1.5 lbs per month [20]. It is 
established that obesity can develop slowly over time or 
as a result of a rapid weight gain [11]. Thus, it is impor -
tant to investigate interventions that may contribute to 
modifying health behaviors for obesity prevention.
Young adulthood is a period when people may be 
highly amenable to healthy behavior change, develop life -
long healthy behaviors, and when the primary or second -
ary prevention of obesity may be feasible. Interventions 
in young adults have the potential for primary cancer 
prevention (i.e., stopping cancer risk factors before they 
develop). Young adulthood is a time when weight gain 
may occur rapidly [21] and developing healthy behaviors 
is critical to maintaining a healthy weight throughout 
adulthood. On average, Canadian adults gain 0.5 to 1 kg every 2 years and this is greater among young adults and 
those with higher BMI.[22] Systematic reviews suggest 
that students attending post-secondary education may 
experience greater weight gain [23, 24].
Narrowly defined lifestyle interventions for obesity pre -
vention, such as those addressing only physical activity, 
have had limited success [25]. The 2020 Obesity Clinical 
Practice Guidelines recommend moving “beyond sim -
plistic approaches of “eat less, move more, ” and address 
the root drivers of obesity” [11]. Yet, there have been rel -
atively few attempts to implement tailored, population-
based obesity prevention interventions in young adults. 
Obesity interventions must be flexible to address the 
complex causes of obesity, and motivational interviewing 
may be a successful strategy [25]. Motivational interview -
ing (MI) is defined as “a collaborative conversation style 
for strengthening a person’s own motivation and com -
mitment to change” [26]. Health care professionals have 
successfully used motivational interviewing for patients 
to set personalized goals for successful healthy life 
changes [27]. Motivational interviewing has shown some 
success for weight loss interventions in young adults, 
[25] but it has not been widely implemented for obesity 
prevention. It is unknown whether obesity prevention 
interventions are more successful among people at high -
est risk. Several obesity risk stratification tools have been 
developed and validated that identify young adults who 
are at greatest risk of obesity later in adulthood [28–30]. 
The use of these risk prediction tools to identify young 
adults who may benefit the most from an obesity pre -
vention intervention may improve success and support 
broader population-level, precision public health or clini -
cal interventions.
The primary study objective is:
1 To determine the feasibility (enrollment, retention, 
data completion, satisfaction) of a 6-month behavio -
ral and educational intervention to promote healthy 
behaviors for obesity prevention among young 
adults.
The secondary objectives are:
2) To determine the effects of the 6-month behavioral 
and educational intervention, compared to an educa -
tional intervention only, on change in BMI, health 
behaviors (nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary 
time), health-related quality of life, and mental health 
(depression and anxiety).

3) To explore whether obesity risk stratification tools 
identify young adults who may be more successful in 
an obesity intervention.
Methods
Study design and population
We will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial 
(RCT). The protocol is reported following the SPIRIT 
guidelines for RCT pilot studies, [31] the Template for 
Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) 
checklist and guideline, [32] and has been pre-registered 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05264740). Study 
participants will be young adults (age 18–29) who are 
students at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, 
Canada. Recruitment posters will be posted in common 
areas on campus, shared on social media, and through 
email lists. The study website is available at https:// motiv 
ate. healt  hsci. mcmas ter. ca/.
The study inclusion criteria are:
• English speaking and capable of providing informed 
consent.
• McMaster University students 18–29 years of age.
• BMI of at least 18.5 (BMI < 18.5 is considered under -
weight and will be excluded).
• Access to wireless Internet (WiFi) at home.
Exclusion criteria are:
• Physical and mental health conditions that would be 
contraindications for a weight management interven -
tion, including eating disorders, pregnancy, cancer, or 
medications that affect body weight.
Randomization
Participants will be randomized to intervention and 
control arms in a 1:1 allocation ratio using a computer-
generated randomization list that will be generated cen -
trally by the Biostatistics Unit at St Joseph’s Healthcare 
Hamilton. Randomization will be stratified by sex and 
BMI (BMI < 25 vs BMI ≥ 25) to achieve some prognostic 
balance. We will use permuted blocks of random sizes 
to ensure equal numbers in each group. The block sizes 
and allocation will be concealed from the participants 
and trial staff, and the randomization codes will only be 
revealed after the participants have been recruited and 
baseline data has been collected. This is an open-label 
trial. Trial staff and participants will not be blinded to the 
intervention, but data analysts will be blinded.Consent and ethics
Ethics approval was obtained from the Hamilton Inte -
grated Research Ethics Board on July 25, 2022 (HiREB 
Project Number: 14675). Informed consent will be 
obtained from all participants at the first in-person 
visit. Participants may choose to withdraw from the 
study at any time and when possible, we will capture 
the reasons for withdrawal. Consideration has been 
given to issues of equity (advertisement and recruit -
ment materials, research staff and investigators), and 
among this population of students, we do not antici -
pate that the English-language requirement will be a 
barrier.
Timing of visits, intervention, and control groups
An overview of the study design is provided in Fig.  1. The 
first visit will occur in-person with a research assistant to 
obtain consent, collect baseline measures, provide par -
ticipants with the study materials/equipment, and build 
a relationship with the study participants. For all subse -
quent visits, participants will have the option of in-per -
son or virtual sessions.
The intervention will include motivational interview -
ing sessions with a trained research assistant/interviewer 
plus educational material. The motivational interviewing 
sessions will occur at baseline and once a month (7 visits 
in total). For this feasibility study, a priori criteria for the 
discontinuation or modification of the allocated inter -
vention are not available.
The research assistant will receive training in moti -
vational interviewing. Intervention fidelity (adherence 
to the principles of MI) will be assessed using recorded 
training interviews and established rating scales with 
continuing training as needed [33]. For training pur -
poses, mock interviews conducted between members of 
the research team will be recorded and evaluated. Inter -
views with study participants will not be recorded.
The control group will receive educational material 
only. The same educational material will be provided to 
both the intervention and control group and will consist 
of evidence-based recommendations based on Canada’s 
food guide [34] and Canadian 24-h movement guidelines 
[35]. The SPIRIT schedule of enrolment, interventions, 
and assessments for this study is provided in Fig. 2.
Measurement of outcomes
Table  1 describes all outcomes. The primary feasibil -
ity outcomes that will be measured are recruitment, 
retention, data completion, and participant satisfac -
tion. We will consider a larger trial feasible if recruit -
ment rates are ≥ 50%, retention rates are ≥ 80%, and the 
Page 4 of 9 Anderson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:156 
data completion rate for all secondary clinical outcomes 
is ≥ 80%. Participant satisfaction with different aspects of 
the study will be measured at the exit questionnaire using 
a Likert scale and semi-structured qualitative free-text 
responses.
Secondary outcomes will include BMI change from 
baseline to 6-months. Interventions are more successful 
if longer than 4 months in duration [36]. All study par -
ticipants will have one in-person visit with the research 
assistant at the start of the study where baseline weight 
and height will be measured using standardized meth -
ods with calibrated study instruments. Participants 
(both intervention and control) will then receive a Fit -
bit activity tracker to wear for the duration of the study. 
Study participants will be asked to visit the study office 
once a month to conduct a self weigh-in using a Fitbit 
electronic “smart” scale (e-scale). They will be asked to 
weigh themselves monthly, and reminders will be sent 
by email or text message. E-scales are feasible and valid 
for research conducted remotely and participant adher -
ence to home weigh-ins is high [37– 39], and as part of 
this feasibility study, we will assess the adherence to self 
weigh-ins when the scale is located in a private study 
office. Other secondary outcomes will include nutri -
tion risk, physical activity (measured as 24-h movement, 
including sedentary time and sleep), and mental health 
collected using online questionnaires at baseline and 
every 2 months. Nutrition risk will be measured using 
the National Cancer Institute’s Dietary Screener Ques -
tionnaire (DSQ). The DSQ measures the frequency of 
intake of selected foods that are known to affect risk of 
cancer and obesity, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sugary drinks. The DSQ has good validity 
compared to 24-h recalls [40]. Self-reported physical 
activity, sedentary time, recreational screen time, and 
sleep will be measured to describe adherence to recom -
mended 24-h movement guidelines using questionnaires 
previously used in young adults [41], including the Inter -
national Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [42], 
and International Sedentary Assessment Tool (ISAT) 
[43]. The Insomnia Severity Index will also be included 
as a measure of perceived sleep quality [44]. Mental 
health is an important upstream determinant of health 
behaviors and is highly associated with obesity risk. We 
will measure depressive symptoms, anxiety, and health-
related quality of life using the following validated tools: 
Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Meas -
ure-10 (CESD-10) [45], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
(GAD-7) [46], and Euroqol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L) [47] We 
anticipate that some youth may also raise issues related 
to alcohol or substance use in the interviews; thus, we 
have included questions that ask about alcohol, smok -
ing, cannabis, and medication use in the questionnaires. 
A single-item measure of body satisfaction is included in 
the study to evaluate any changes over the course of the 
study [48]. A validated two-item food insecurity screen 
is also included [49].
For objective 3, we will evaluate whether feasibility and 
other secondary outcomes differed for participants who 
were identified as high versus low risk using existing obe -
sity risk stratification tools. Three validated risk stratifi -
cation tools will be applied to the data to explore these 
differences [28–30]. The Edmonton Obesity Staging Sys -
tem will also be used [50]. The required variables for each 
Fig. 1 Overview of the study design

of the risk tools will be collected from the baseline ques -
tionnaire (e.g., parent obesity, history of child obesity, 
alcohol, smoking, medical history). Feasibility data to 
inform costing and economic analyses for a larger scale trial will be collected. In addition to the EQ-5D-5L, self-
reported healthcare use, and time missed from school/
work will be collected on the surveys. For this pilot study 
a descriptive cost analysis will be conducted.Fig. 2 SPIRIT schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments

Data collection and management
All data will be stored in a secure REDCap database. 
Surveys will be collected online using secure electronic 
data capture in REDcap. The final trial dataset will only 
be available to select members of the research team (LA, 
LM, TI). The final dataset will not be made publicly avail -
able to protect the confidentiality of participants, but 
de-identified data could be made available upon request. 
Baseline surveys will collect detailed data on socio -
economic variables, including age, sex, gender identity, 
income, and food security, medical history, and the sec -
ondary outcomes described above (nutrition, physical 
activity, sedentary time, mental health). Follow-up sur -
veys administered every 2 months (at 2, 4, and 6 months) 
will collect updated data on secondary outcomes. Par -
ticipants in both the control and intervention groups will 
receive a $30 gift card at the time of each survey comple -
tion. We will continue to collect data from participants 
if they deviate from protocol unless there is withdrawal 
from the study. To ensure confidentiality, a unique study 
id number will be used for the weight and activity data 
and linked at McMaster by the research team to the main 
study database.
Safety protocols and unanticipated outcomes
Possible adverse outcomes may include concerns related 
to mental health, including eating disorders or frustra -
tion due to weight gain/no change. Expectations of the 
research will be laid out before enrollment and feelings 
such as these can be addressed as part of the motiva -
tional interviewing process. Our research team including 
the research assistants/interviewers and physician co-
investigator (EA) are equipped to assess the situation and provide necessary referrals. Medical and counseling ser -
vices are available on campus for all students. If partici -
pants raise any concerns of self-harm or harm to others, 
then safety protocols will be followed.
Data analysis
The analysis and reporting of our results will be done 
according to the CONSORT guidelines [51]. The data 
analyst will be blinded. Patient screening, randomization, 
allocation, and follow-up numbers will be illustrated in a 
flow diagram. Baseline data will be reported in a table for 
both groups (intervention and control) and summarized 
as means (standard deviation) or median (first quar -
tile, third quartile) for continuous variables and counts 
(percent) for categorical variables. Data on feasibility 
outcomes will be measured and compared to pre-deter -
mined thresholds for interpretation. The primary analysis 
will be by intention-to-treat (data from participants will 
be analyzed according to their allocation irrespective of 
whether they received that intervention). Comparison of 
groups for secondary outcomes will be reported descrip -
tively for this pilot study. No formal significance testing 
for comparisons of the secondary clinical outcomes will 
be made because this is a pilot study with a priori sample 
size determined based on feasibility outcomes only. It is 
well established that there are sex and gender differences 
in obesity [52]. Disaggregated data on sex and gender will 
be reported.
Sample size
Our sample size estimation was based on feasibil -
ity considerations and calculated using WINPEPI [53].

participants will complete the study with a 7.5% margin 
of error, 110 participants are needed (55 intervention 
and 55 control). Since the randomization will be strati -
fied by sex and BMI (BMI < 25 vs BMI ≥ 25), we will have 
approximately equal numbers in each group. This sample 
size is not sufficiently powered to make between-group 
comparisons but will provide accurate data on feasibility 
and estimates of effect size variability that will inform the 
sample size calculation of a larger definitive trial.
Reporting and interpretation
Study results will be reported following the CON -
SORT extension for randomized pilot and feasibility tri -
als guideline [54]. For each feasibility outcome, we will 
report whether the feasibility threshold was met and use 
a traffic light system to inform progression to a larger 
trial. Green, proceed to larger trial; yellow, proceed with 
some modifications; and red, larger trial not feasible. At 
least one feasibility outcome must be green. Any devia -
tions to the protocol will be recorded and reported in the 
final manuscript. Study results will be shared with par -
ticipants through a final report and published in a peer-
reviewed manuscript.
Conclusions
Although it is well recognized that the causes of obesity 
are complex, many obesity trials have evaluated a nar -
rowly defined “one-size-fits-all” intervention. We will 
evaluate the feasibility of motivational interviewing ses -
sions that will be flexible and allow participants to dis -
cuss the health behaviors that are most important to 
them, thus tailoring the intervention to their needs. This 
approach will allow participants to set their own behavio -
ral change goals. Further, we will explore the feasibility of 
a risk stratification approach to an obesity intervention to 
determine if higher-risk young adults benefit more from 
the intervention.
This intervention is designed to be flexible to focus on 
a broad range of health behaviors so study participants 
can set behavioral change goals related to the behaviors 
that they think are most important to them. While for 
some participants, this may focus on traditional, obesity-
related risk factors such as diet or physical activity, for 
other participants this may include behaviors related to 
sleep, mental health, substance use, or time management. 
All these behaviors have the potential to either directly or 
indirectly impact obesity prevention.
Our feasibility trial will inform future larger RCTs for 
obesity prevention. The results of this study have the 
potential to directly contribute to the primary prevention 
of several types of cancer by testing an intervention that 
could be scalable to public health, post-secondary edu -
cation, or primary care settings. This study is pragmatic with the option of remote visits for MI. Unlike traditional 
MI, this format with a trained interviewer is feasible and 
the results of the risk stratification objective may inform 
who would benefit the most from a larger-scale program. 
This pilot study will provide proof of concept for an inter -
vention that could be expanded to other settings such as 
public health, post-secondary education, or primary care. 
If successful, this program could be implemented in uni -
versity wellness services and may have a profound impact 
on the primary prevention of an established and highly 
prevalent chronic disease risk factor.
