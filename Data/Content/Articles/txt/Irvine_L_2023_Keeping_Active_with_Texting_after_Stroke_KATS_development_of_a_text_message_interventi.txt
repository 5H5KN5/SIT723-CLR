Abstract 
Background Post-stroke physical activity reduces disability and risk of further stroke. When stroke rehabilitation ends, 
some people feel abandoned by services and struggle to undertake physical activities that support recovery and 
health. The aim of this study was to codesign a novel text message intervention to promote physical activity among 
people with stroke and provide support when formal rehabilitation ends. This manuscript describes the intervention 
development processes that will inform future pilot and feasibility studies.
Methods The planned intervention was a series of text messages to be sent in a predetermined sequence to people 
with stroke at the end of rehabilitation. The intervention, underpinned by behaviour change theory and using salient 
behaviour change techniques, would provide daily messages offering encouragement and support for the uptake 
and maintenance of physical activity following stroke. The intervention was codesigned by a Collaborative Working 
Group, comprised of people with stroke, rehabilitation therapists, representatives from stroke charities and academ-
ics. A four-step framework was used to design the intervention: formative research on physical activity post-stroke, 
creation of the behaviour change text message intervention, pre-testing and refinement. Formative research included 
a review of the scientific evidence and interviews with community-dwelling people with stroke. Data generated were 
used by the Collaborative Working Group to identify topics to be addressed in the intervention. These were mapped 
to constructs of the Health Action Process Approach, and salient behaviour change techniques to deliver the inter -
vention were identified. The intervention was rendered into a series of text messages to be delivered over 12 weeks. 
The draft intervention was revised and refined through an iterative process including review by people with stroke, 
their spouses, rehabilitation therapists and experts in the field of stroke.
The messages encourage regular physical activity but do not prescribe exercise or provide reminders to exercise at 
specific times. They use conversational language to encourage engagement, and some are personalised for par -
ticipants. Quotes from people with stroke provide encouragement and support and model key behaviour change 
techniques such as goal setting and coping planning.
Discussion Co-design processes were critical in systematically developing this theory and evidence-based inter -
vention. People with stroke and rehabilitation therapists provided insights into perceived barriers post-rehabilitation

and identified strategies to overcome them. The structured multistep approach highlighted areas for improvement 
through successive rounds of review. The intervention will be tested for acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness in 
future studies. This co-design approach could be used for interventions for other heath behaviours and with different 
populations.

Key messages regarding feasibility
What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibility?
• Would people with stroke engage with a behaviour 
change intervention delivered by text message?
• What content and form of delivery would be most 
useful for increasing physical activity?
• Would it be feasible to identify and recruit people at 
the end of stroke rehabilitation?
What are the key feasibility findings?
• Co-design with people with stroke, therapists 
and experts in stroke rehabilitation were essen -
tial for developing this theoretically and empirically 
informed text message intervention
• People with stroke confirmed they would welcome 
an intervention at the end of rehabilitation.
• Successive rounds of review and revision by the co-
design team led to a coherent intervention to be 
delivered over 12 weeks.
What are the implications of the feasibility findings for 
the design of the main study?
The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention 
will now be tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial. 
Areas for consideration are as follows
• Working with therapists to recruit people from dif -
ferent community settings
• Using accelerometry as the primary outcome meas -
ure of physical activity and determining appropriate 
secondary outcomes
• Conducting interviews for qualitative evaluation of 
acceptability and exploring how participants used the 
intervention to inform further refinement
Background
Regular physical activity following stroke contributes to 
substantial health benefits including improved fitness, 
balance and walking ability [1–5] and may reduce fac -
tors such as hypertension and raised cholesterol levels that increase the risk of recurrent stroke [6, 7]. Despite 
this, many people with stroke are classified as sedentary 
[8–11], placing them at increased risk of health problems 
[12].
A range of physical activities and exercises to improve 
strength, balance, motor control and function and aero -
bic fitness are essential for recovery from stroke [4, 13, 
14]. Internationally, early guided rehabilitation exercise 
programmes focus on intensive, repetitive task-orien -
tated training supervised by a physiotherapist [13–15]. 
When rehabilitation ends, people with stroke often feel 
abandoned by support services [16–19] and marginalised 
due to a lack of continuity of care and access to commu -
nity services [20]. To ensure long-term benefit, people 
with stroke need to move from structured exercise plans 
to self-directed activities within their own environment 
[21]. Low levels of physical activity in the year after stroke 
are high among people living in the community [9–11], 
where recorded daily step counts may be half of those 
of age-matched healthy people [8]. Longitudinal data 
show that low post-rehabilitation physical activity levels 
remain so over the subsequent 2 years [8, 22]. Beyond 
formal rehabilitation, many face challenges in achieving 
recommended levels of physical activity, including modi -
fiable factors such as physical function, low self-efficacy, 
fatigue, fear of falls and depression [23]. People may feel 
they do not have the knowledge and resources to con -
tinue with exercise and activities to enhance their recov -
ery [20, 24].
One resource-efficient way to promote physical activ -
ity is via text messaging. Text message interventions can 
provide structured support, embedding evidence-based 
behaviour change theory and techniques into a series of 
messages, to guide people through the process of change. 
Text messaging is suited to people with stroke, some of 
whom may have cognitive problems or upper limb weak -
ness which may affect the ability to use complex digital 
interventions. Text messaging requires little effort to 
engage, and participants do not have to learn how receive 
or use the intervention [25, 26]. Interventions which 
require participants to login or access a website or appli -
cation present barriers for many [27].
Interventions using mobile phones have been 
used widely to promote physical activity in general

 Irvine et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:105 
 
populations with meta-analyses reporting modest effects 
on objectively measured activity levels [28–32]. A recent 
meta-analysis reported a statistically significant higher 
post-intervention daily step count (Cohen’s d = 0.38, 95% 
CI = 0.19, 0.58, based on 10 studies) [31], although the 
effect on moderate to vigorous physical activity was not 
statistically significant. A few pilot studies have reported 
the potential for text message interventions to promote 
physical activity among people with stroke [33–36]. The 
STROKEWALK study delivered instructional text mes -
sages to promote regular walking and functional leg exer -
cises over 3 months [36]. A study by Kamwesiga et  al. 
reported early pilot work, where reminder text messages 
to perform three daily activities were used as part of a 
family-centred intervention to support participation in 
daily activities [34, 35]. These mainly provide instruction 
or prompts to undertake activity, rather than sequenced 
behaviour change strategies and have yet to be tested in 
randomised controlled trials. Cadhilac et  al. have also 
developed the iVERVE intervention which uses text mes -
sages, informed by behavioural theory and behaviour 
change techniques, as part of a self-management pro -
gramme to support goal attainment for recovery after 
stroke and in secondary prevention after stroke [33]. 
These studies vary in terms of the level of involvement of 
people with stroke and other stakeholders during devel -
opment. An iterative and person-centred approach is rec -
ommended and is essential for developing and evaluating 
digital interventions [37].
The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to 
codesign with people with stroke, their family/friends 
and rehabilitation professionals, a novel, theoretically 
informed behaviour change intervention, comprising a 
series of text messages, to support community-dwelling 
stroke survivors to adhere to physical activity and goals 
for recovery, and (2) to determine what community-
dwelling stroke survivors consider to be key features of a 
texting intervention to ensure that it is accessible, accept -
able and useful in supporting their post-rehabilitation 
exercise and PA goals.
This manuscript therefore describes the intervention 
development processes that will inform future pilot and 
feasibility studies. It presents the systematic development 
of a co-designed novel, theoretically informed text mes -
sage intervention to support community-dwelling people 
with stroke to be physically active when formal rehabili -
tation ends. The process involved multistage, iterative 
development with contributions from people with stroke, 
health professionals and experts in the field of stroke 
rehabilitation. The messages are underpinned by behav -
iour change theory, the Health Action Process Approach 
(HAPA) [38], and use established behaviour change 
techniques [39] to provide support and guidance for increasing and maintaining regular activity. Early mes -
sages, to foster interest and engagement, are followed by 
a series of messages to address and illustrate the process 
of behaviour change in sequence: increase motivation 
and create intentions to change, encourage commitment 
to setting goals for physical activity going forward, make 
action plans, identify barriers to being active and develop 
coping strategies and increase self-efficacy for long-term 
maintenance.
Methods and results
Ethical approval was granted by the University of Dundee 
Schools of Nursing & Health Sciences and Dentistry 
Research Ethics Committee (UOD/SHS/2020/022/MOR -
RIS). Informed consent to participation was given by 
participants.
The intervention was developed in line with the UK 
Medical Research Council Framework for Complex 
Interventions [40], using iterative co-design processes 
and informed by a framework for developing text mes -
saging programmes created by Abroms et  al. [41]. The 
four-step framework covered formative research on 
physical activity among people with stroke, the design 
of a theoretically and empirically informed text message 
intervention, pre-testing of the intervention and subse -
quent revision of the text messages (Table 1).
Prior to obtaining research funding, a meeting was 
convened with the research team’s patient and public 
involvement (PPI) group, which included five people with 
stroke and three spouses. The group supported the devel -
opment of a text message intervention for people who 
were at the end of rehabilitation following stroke. They 
identified challenges that people with stroke experience 
in maintaining regular physical activity at this time of 
transition. The group felt that a text message intervention 
would be a simple but important way to offer encourage -
ment, increase motivation and pass on tips from other 
people with stroke.
The Core Research Team (CRT) codesigned the inter -
vention with a Collaborative Working Group (CWG) 
[42]. The GWC uses a structured approach for bring -
ing together key individuals to support collaborative 
decision-making and iterative intervention refinements. 
To create the CWG, a list of the expertise required to 
develop the intervention was drawn up. People with 
stroke who had already advised on the team’s research 
projects were invited by email and telephone call to 
take part (face-to-face contact was not permitted due 
to COVID-19 restrictions). They were also given writ -
ten information about the format of the meetings and 
what their input might be. Rehabilitation therapists from 
two health boards were invited by email to take part. 
Their knowledge and insight into potential participants’ 
Page 4 of 15 Irvine et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:105 
needs would be essential in identifying potential con -
tent for the intervention and for planning a recruitment 
strategy. Academic colleagues with expertise in stroke 
rehabilitation, intervention design and trial manage -
ment were then recruited by email invitation. Finally, 
stroke charities were approached by email to invite rep -
resentatives involved with people undergoing post-stroke 
rehabilitation.
The CWG included eight people with stroke from 
existing PPI groups, seven rehabilitation therapists, eight 
academics (with special interest in stroke rehabilitation, 
biomechanics, clinical trials and speech and language therapy) and two representatives from stroke organisa -
tions, i.e. Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland and the Stroke 
Association. The CWG met on two occasions, through 
videoconferencing, rather than the intended face-to-face 
meetings, due to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 
pandemic. The size of the group aimed to ensure as wide 
a range of stakeholders as possible whilst ensuring the 
group was not too large for meaningful discussion within 
the videoconferencing format. An additional online 
meeting was convened with the PPI group, and a subject 
expert in goal setting in rehabilitation was consulted on 
one occasion. One member of the PPI group was part Table 1 Framework for intervention design

Co‑design of the text message intervention
Step 1: Formative research
 
Step 1.1: Survey to assess mobile phone use following 
stroke Physiotherapists from one Scottish Health Board 
were invited to conduct a short, anonymised survey with 
community-dwelling clients who were receiving post-
stroke rehabilitation to assess the feasibility of a text 
messaging intervention. The sample was a convenience 
sample, based on the cohort of physiotherapists in the 
area and on the patients in their care who were able to 
respond. Forty-nine people provided information about 
their mobile phone ownership and use.
Most respondents (n = 42, 86%) owned a mobile 
phone, with another 8 having access to a spouse’s phone. 
Of those who owned a mobile phone, 31 (63%) owned 
smartphones. Whilst 38 people (77%) received text mes -
sages on their phone, 35 (71%) used their phone to send 
messages. Around half of respondents (n = 25, 51%) used 
a phone to access the Internet or applications.
Step 1.2: Review of the scientific evidence To ensure 
that the intervention was informed by relevant and con -
temporary empirical evidence, three information sources 
were reviewed: (a) the scientific literature on barriers and 
facilitators to physical activity after stroke, (b) national 
and international guidelines for physical activity post-
stroke and (c) tailoring text message interventions for the 
target group.
a. Barriers and facilitators for physical activity after 
stroke
Systematic reviews and syntheses of barriers and facili -
tators to physical activity post-stroke identified topics to 
be addressed within the intervention [23, 43–49]. Com -
mon barriers to physical activity post-stroke include 
negative emotional responses to physical activity, such as 
embarrassment, fear of falling and fear of having another 
stroke, and physiological factors including fatigue, 
impaired  physical function and low cardiorespiratory fit -
ness [13, 23, 47, 50]. Perceptions of limited capability due 
to stroke, cognitive and communication impairments, 
low self-efficacy, mood, confidence and expectations of 
recovery contribute to inactivity after stroke. Facilita -
tors for physical activity following stroke include self-
determination to regain function and return to previous 
activity, enjoyment of being active, previous success in 
physical activity and social support [43, 47, 50–52].b. National and international guidelines for rehabilita -
tion and physical activity after stroke
Current international guidance for physical activity 
after stroke [13, 14, 21] suggests that people should be 
active every day and avoid long periods of sitting. They 
should aim to accumulate 150 min or more of moder -
ate intensity physical activity per week and engage in 
muscle strengthening activities at least twice per week. 
The intensity of physical activity should be gradually 
increased. The guidelines provided suggestions on how 
physical activity could be increased, e.g. through setting 
meaningful goals for activities of daily living and leisure 
interests and participation in group social activities.
c.  Tailoring text message interventions for the target 
group
Many studies and systematic reviews have identified 
features that may increase engagement and effective -
ness of text message interventions [27, 28, 30, 31, 41, 49, 
53–56]. These include the use of psychological theories, 
BCTs and tailoring of interventions for the target group 
or individuals. Other characteristics include the duration 
of interventions, personalisation of messages, interactive 
messages, the frequency of delivery of messages and the 
language used. It remains unclear which of these, or com -
binations of these, are most effective in achieving and 
sustaining behaviour change [26, 28, 31, 49, 56]. Under -
standing the target group’s circumstances and values can 
facilitate tailoring of content and delivery of an interven -
tion, which increases receptiveness and leads to greater 
engagement [27, 49].
Step 1.3. Clarifying what people with stroke want/
need from an intervention To define the parameters of 
the intervention and inform its development, the CWG 
met to assist in interpreting data from Steps 1.1 and 1.2. 
A CWG uses a structured reflective process of “what, so 
what, now what?” to guide collaborators in collectively 
analysing emerging findings, making decisions about 
intervention design and informing the direction of the 
ongoing research [42]. The CWG considers the following: 
(a) What do the data tell us? (b) So what does this mean 
for the intervention? and (c) Now what information do we 
need to refine the intervention,and how will we adapt our 
research design? CWG meetings were video-recorded 
and transcribed. Decisions taken by the group were col -
lated and action points taken forward by the CRT. At the 
first CWG meeting, with 21 attendees and lasting 1 h 55 
min, the group confirmed that people with stroke and 
therapists believe that the proposed intervention could 
complement community rehabilitation. Hospital and 
Page 6 of 15 Irvine et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:105 
community therapists negotiated how they could support 
the delivery of a text message intervention by identifying 
potential participants at key stages in their recovery (on 
discharge from hospital or at the end of community reha -
bilitation). Together, therapists and people with stroke 
clarified how text messages could bring continuity from 
supported goal setting to participants setting goals inde -
pendently. Therapists agreed that they could liaise with 
the study facilitator in advance of participants receiving 
the intervention, so that personalised information about 
recent goal setting and plans could be incorporated into 
messages.
Step 1.4. Interviews with community-dwelling peo -
ple with stroke Having established the relevance and 
potential usefulness of the proposed intervention, tel -
ephone interviews were conducted with 14 commu -
nity-dwelling people in rural and urban areas from two 
Scottish Health Boards. We adopted a purposeful sam -
pling strategy to obtain a maximum variation sample, 
based on sex, time post-stroke and sociodemographics. 
We based the sample size on our previous work in inter -
vention development (46) that indicated that a sample of 
12–14 participants would provide adequate information 
to inform intervention development. We also analysed 
the transcripts as the study progressed and completed 
sampling when we saw that no new ideas were emerging. 
The aim of the interviews was to ascertain participants’ 
opinions on the acceptability and feasibility of a text mes -
sage intervention and to explore topics to be addressed in 
the messages. Prior to the interviews, participants were 
given 15 illustrative text messages, presented in a word 
document. Text messages were displayed on images of a 
mobile phone, to demonstrate the possible format and 
content of the proposed intervention.
Recruitment
Potential participants were identified by therapists and 
from local stroke groups and stroke exercise classes. Nine 
men and five women, aged from 37 to 79 years (median 
57.5 years), were recruited. The time since stroke ranged 
from 4 months to 16 years. Participants provided rep -
resentation across the sociodemographic spectrum. 
The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) [57] 
scores for participants included all quintiles: numbers 
per quintile, 1 to 5 (1 being the most disadvantaged), 
were 6, 1, 2, 2 and 3, respectively.
Data collection and analysis
Participants were asked to reflect on their rehabili -
tation period, including the types of physical activity 
goals that were set during rehabilitation and beyond 
and personal barriers and facilitators for being active. They discussed their readiness at the end of the reha -
bilitation period for an intervention to increase physi -
cal activity. They gave comments and suggestions on the 
illustrative text messages including intervention compo -
nents, content of the messages, language used, timing 
and frequency of message delivery and duration of the 
intervention.
Telephone interviews, conducted by the study 
researcher (LI), were recorded and transcribed. Field 
notes were taken to provide context. The six stages of 
thematic analysis [58] were used by the research team 
to interpret findings and inform intervention develop -
ment. The transcripts were read by two researchers (L. 
I. and J. M.) to identify a coding framework for organ -
ising the data. The initial codes were reviewed, agreed 
and grouped into categories relevant to the description 
and evaluation of participant perceptions of interven -
tion components. Interpretation of the data was agreed 
with the rest of the research team. Data were managed in 
NVivo V.12.
Findings
Usefulness of messages Almost all participants 
(n = 12/14) reported that they would have welcomed the 
opportunity to receive a text message intervention at the 
end of their rehabilitation. Most had been able to use 
their phones early in their recovery and felt that most 
people would have the ability to engage in the interven -
tion by the time their rehabilitation was complete. Some 
felt that an intervention would have provided continu -
ity of support at a time when they felt vulnerable. The 
interviews confirmed that some people with stroke feel 
abandoned by services at the end of rehabilitation and 
experience isolation:
All of a sudden, I seemed to have just got dangled 
over a cliff and dropped (02, male)
I felt it was a big world out there and I needed all the 
help I could get (03, female)
Participants believed that text messages may be able to 
reduce feelings of abandonment and isolation by keeping 
in touch:
To get people reminded that they’re not lost in the 
system, that although things have changed that 
they’re no longer being seen, they’re not lost in the 
system (09, male)
Just getting that text would be enough, no matter 
what it said (05, female)
Participants were aware that the end of active reha -
bilitation can lead to a dip in motivation to be physically 
active and saw the proposed intervention as a way to 
boost motivation at that crucial time:
Page 7 of 15
 Irvine et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:105 
 
The important thing is to keep people motivated and 
I don’t know whether they’ll be motivated. People 
will motivate themselves or the stroke will be so dev -
astating they won’t feel like motivating themselves 
(03, female)
Anything that would give me tips and tricks on what 
to do to improve, I think would be helpful (13, male)
Some participants talked about cognitive problems, 
visual processing difficulties and a need to avoid infor -
mation overload. Succinct easy to read and process mes -
sages were preferred.
It’s easy to read the texts…… My brain gets fed up 
trying to read it, if it’s too much information (11, 
male)
Terminology and tone The sample messages were infor -
mal, in keeping with texting etiquette, and a non-author -
itative style was used throughout. Participants welcomed 
the friendly tone as it fitted with the medium being used:
I think for a text that is appropriate because texting 
is quite informal (03, female)
I would prefer if there was more off the cuff and off-
hand, rather than being terribly formal (04, male)
The messages provided encouragement and avoided 
prescribing physical activity. Participants felt strongly 
that the messages should encourage but not dictate when 
to exercise:
I don’t like getting told what to do as I said, but get -
ting encouraged is okay, there’s nothing wrong getting 
encouraged (02, male)
And if you get a text to say, “Oh, you should really 
go for a walk today” and it’s pouring with rain—you 
would just throw the phone away (05, female)
Participants clarified terms for physical activity and 
exercise that would be most appropriate:into behaviour through action planning, coping plan -
ning and self-efficacy. The HAPA provides a framework 
for integrating effective behaviour change techniques 
(BCTs). BCTS are discrete components, e.g. goal setting, 
action planning and self-monitoring, used in combina -
tion at appropriate stages of the intervention delivery to 
facilitate behaviour change [59]. Selected relevant BCTs 
from Michie et  al. ’s taxonomy of 93 techniques were 
incorporated to operationalise the intervention [39]. 
The behaviour change maintenance framework [60] was 
used to ensure BCTs for sustained physical activity were 
included.
Step 2 Design of the text message intervention  
 
Step 2.1. Defining intervention content Data from 
the evidence reviews, interviews and team discussions 
were collated to identify topics to be addressed in the 
intervention. Table  2 lists topics for inclusion and the 
sources of information that informed their selection. 
An additional file describes in detail the challenges 
identified and solutions obtained through collabora -
tive working (see Additional file  1). Topics for inclusion 
were systematically mapped to each of the HAPA con -
structs and themes for maintenance [60]. Next, salient 
BCTs to deliver the intervention, identified from the 
Michie et  al. taxonomy [39], were mapped on to each 
HAPA construct (see Additional file  2). A logic model 
was produced to guide the development of the inter -
vention and to clarify how behaviour change might 
be achieved. The logic model was used to guide the  
development of the intervention and to clarify how 
behaviour change might be achieved. The model is pro -
vided in Additional file 3 .
Writing the text messages One member of the CRT (L. 
I.), with expertise in developing in text messaging inter -
ventions, wrote messages for each of the topics identi -
fied. Initially, a bank of more than 150 messages was 
constructed. These were tailored to address challenges 
people with stroke encounter and guide them through 
the behaviour change process. Message length was 
restricted to 160 characters which is the allowance for 
one text message. Texts were written in complete sen -
tences. Texting abbreviations, which may be misinter -
preted, were avoided as studies have shown that texting 
abbreviations may make intervention studies less credible 
[41]. Emojis were used sparingly, on days when humour 
was used.
Strategies to enhance acceptability of the messages and 
increase engagement were incorporated into the inter -
vention [27, 41, 49] (Table  3). The interviewees (Step 
1.4) suggested that it would be helpful if the messages Not everybody sees exercise as being in the gym, 
some would maybe get put off by that, so, the general 
thought on that would have been not to refer to it as 
exercise but refer to it as activity (10, male)
Step 1.5. Theoretical models of behaviour change to 
underpin the intervention To consolidate the insights 
from the extant literature, CWG expertise and inter -
views, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) 
[38] was selected to guide intervention development. 
The HAPA provides a theoretical framework outlining 
the processes required to change behaviour. It involves 
two phases: a motivational phase where the inten -
tions to change are formed (influenced by perceptions 
of risk, outcome expectancies and action self-efficacy) 
and a volitional phase where intentions are translated

appeared to come from a named individual. Credibility of 
the source increases engagement and receptiveness to an 
intervention [49]. To increase credibility, some messages 
each week were signed off by the study researcher. Mes -
sages containing quotes from people with stroke were 
used several times each week to provide encouragement and support, give hints and tips and to model key behav -
iours and BCTs such as goal setting or coping planning. 
Asking questions was used as a tool to promote cognitive 
engagement, interaction and increase retention. Ques -
tions were matched to HAPA constructs [38] and were 
framed in different ways to encourage engagement and Table 2 Topics to be addressed in the intervention

enactment, e.g. to report physical activities undertaken, 
describe a goal or reflect on progress.
The daily routines and availability of the target group to 
interact with the intervention can affect acceptability and 
engagement [49]. Fatigue, a common post-stroke prob -
lem, was highlighted by the PPI group and interviewees 
(Step 1.4). Although text messages can be opened at the 
recipients’ convenience, most messages were scheduled 
to be sent between 10:30 am and 5:00 pm, when par -
ticipants were likely to be most receptive and available 
to engage in physical activity. Within this window, mes -
sages were scheduled to be delivered at different times 
of the day to maintain an element of anticipation. Satur -
days’ messages often included some trivia or humour, a 
technique used in previous studies, to provide some light 
relief after the more serious topics discussed during the 
week [61–63]. This emphasised the break between the 
weeks and encouraged relaxation and reflection at the 
weekends. People with stroke (Step 1.4 interviews) felt 
that humour was appropriate and would not detract from 
the key messages being delivered:
Aye well, a touch of humour never goes amiss, does 
it? (04, male)
Step 2.2. Refining content and form of delivery for 
people with stroke Having created a bank of messages, a 
second CWG meeting to start the refinement process was 
convened. At an online meeting with 17 people, lasting 
1 h and 50 min, the CWG explored whether additional 
materials should accompany the text messages, namely 
a handbook, a diary and a list of online resources. Some 
studies report that supplementary materials increase 
effectiveness [28]. As some people with stroke have trou -
ble with memory and cognition, the CWG agreed that a 
study handbook would be helpful for operationalising the 
selected BCTs. It would provide additional information, 
reinforce topics addressed and explain key components 
of the intervention in greater detail. The CWG decided 
that a blank calendar for the intervention period should 
be provided. Participants would be invited to use it for 
setting goals, recording activities undertaken and moni -
toring and reflecting on progress. Current guidelines 
for physical activity after stroke recommend 150 min 
of moderate to vigorous activity per week. People with 
stroke gave mixed feedback on whether this information 
should be included. Some felt that it was so far removed 
from some people’s capability, it might be disheartening 
and therefore counterproductive. Others felt it gave hope 
and encouragement to strive to improve. To discuss in 
more detail, a separate meeting was convened with the 
PPI group. A decision to include it in the intervention was subsequently taken, but with guidance on how it 
could be done in manageable sessions, to made it appear 
less daunting. Data from the CWG and PPI meetings 
were collated for incorporation into the text messages.
Step 2.3 Creating draft 1 of the text message inter -
vention From the initial bank of messages, individual 
messages were mapped on to a 12-week blank calendar, 
to provide a coherent sequence. The intervention was 
a set of unique messages to be delivered to all partici -
pants as a discrete intervention. Although messages were 
stand-alone and did not require the reader to know what 
had gone before, the daily messages were designed to 
build on previous topics to guide the reader to sustained 
regular physical activity.
The intervention was organised in weekly blocks, fol -
lowing the HAPA structure, to guide participants from 
forming intentions to be active, to action through goal 
setting, planning, self-monitoring and coping planning 
and to achieve sustained physical activity. Participants 
were encouraged to set new goals at the beginning of the 
week, monitor their activities mid-week and then reflect 
on progress towards the end of the week. This reflection 
would feed into decisions about setting new goals for the 
next week.
Draft 1 comprised 134 messages to be delivered over 12 
weeks. Messages were scheduled to be delivered on 5 or 
6 days on most weeks. The complexity of the intervention 
meant that on some days, a few messages were required 
to deliver all the information. The first message would 
introduce the topic, e.g. goal setting, a second would 
demonstrate how to do it and a third would model the 
behaviour by giving an example of a goal used by another 
person with stroke.
Step 3 Pre -testing the intervention concept and messages
To prepare for pre-testing draft 1 of the intervention, 
the text messages and delivery plan were presented as a 
table in a word document, with columns containing the 
following: day of the week, time for message delivery, the 
message and a blank space for comments. The individual 
messages and delivery plan were reviewed iteratively. 
Draft 1 was initially reviewed by the CRT, and revisions 
were made (Step 3.1). Following revisions, draft 2 was 
reviewed by a speech and language expert (Step 3.2), 
people with stroke and their spouses, health profession -
als and experts in the field of stroke (Step 3.3). Review -
ers gave feedback in one of three ways: by providing a 
summary of overall impressions and suggestions for 
change, by commenting on individual text messages or by 
detailing specific points that should be changed. Review -
ers were asked to consider whether participants would 
engage with the intervention, whether they felt that 
Page 10 of 15 Irvine et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:105 
the content would be helpful and if any important con -
tent was missing. Finally, they were asked to reflect on 
the tone of the messages, to identify messages that were 
unclear or interrupted the flow and to identify topics or 
specific information that should be included.
Step 3.1. Review and revisions by the Core Research 
Team  The remit for the CRT was to ensure that behav -
iour change components were adequately addressed at 
appropriate times using BCTs in line with the underpin -
ning theory. Ensuring that participants will be engaged 
from the outset and that interest will be maintained for 
the duration of the intervention is paramount. A key 
decision taken at this stage was to reduce the number of 
messages in the intervention. A few people with stroke 
had indicated that they would not want too many mes -
sages. The number of messages was reduced to one per 
day, every day for 12 weeks, apart from 11 days when 
two messages were needed to develop a theme or model 
a particular behaviour. This reduction was achieved by 
increasing the number of characters in individual mes -
sages. Most people have smart phones, so this was seen 
to be acceptable. Although the maximum number of characters per message is 160 characters, smart phones 
facilitate concatenation, so that messages with more than 
160 characters appear as one message, making them easy 
to read. For draft 2, messages had up to 390 characters 
which were broken down into short paragraphs for ease 
of reading. Thus, the intervention was reduced to 95 
messages without losing content. Additional changes 
included more personalisation and adding messages in 
the voice of people with stroke and therapists to enhance 
credibility (Table 4).
Step 3.2. Review and revision by speech and lan -
guage expert Draft 2 was reviewed by a speech and lan -
guage therapist who amended messages to ensure that 
the grammar was as simple as possible. Long sentences 
were shortened by removing words that were redundant 
and by simplifying phrases when it did not interrupt the 
flow or meaning of the messages. Apostrophe abbrevia -
tions were removed to maintain clarity for people with 
visual processing difficulties, although care was taken to 
maintain informality of the messages. Some sentences 
were expanded to ensure clarity and any complex phras -
ing simplified.Table 3 Strategies used to enhance the acceptability of the intervention

Provide credibility of the intervention
Messages from humans are preferred
Mention the participant’s therapist name on two occasions during first 2

Mention goals set with the therapist on discharge from rehabilitation Provides continuity from rehab services
Encourage participants to continue with and build on work done with the 
therapists
Use weekly themes, e.g. goal setting, self-monitoring, benefits of walking, 
coping planning and problem-solving, developing routines and habitsProvide structure and opportunity to develop a theme over the period, i.e. 
explain the concept, suggest how to do it, model the behaviour by exam-
ples from a person with stroke
Ask direct questions and rhetorical questions. Participants would be able 
to reply to messages (which would be received by the research team). 
However, they would not receive a reply in returnIncrease engagement and interactivity
Encourage reflection on progress
Use quotes from other stroke survivors (taken directly from interviews 
with people with stroke)Provides credibility of the intervention
Helps participants feel they are not the only one facing the challenges
Encourage participants to try what others have done or consider what they 
could achieve
Use the voice of other people with stroke to pass on hints and tips about 
being activeAvoids didactic instruction. Interviewees made it clear that people did not 
want to be told what to do
Incorporate humorous trivia, usually loosely related to physical activity, to 
increase appeal to a heterogeneous groupIncrease engagement, encourage interactivity
Used at the weekend to help provide structure
Schedule message delivery between 10 am and 5:00 pm on weekdays 
and 10:45 am and 7:10 pm at the weekendsAvoid early mornings and evening as fatigue is often a problem. Some 
people have carers at those times
Incorporate guidelines for physical activity after stroke explained using a 
physiotherapists voiceRaise awareness of guidelines without telling people what they should be 
doing
Provides credibility
Suggest online opportunities to be active suggested (credible sites 
recommended by therapists)Provide credible options for different forms of physical activity

Step 3.3. Review and revision by service users and 
experts in the field of stroke The updated messages 
(draft 2) were sent by post or email to 15 people for 
review. The reviewers comprised people with stroke from 
the CWG (n = 4), participants who were interviewed at 
Step 1.4 (n = 2), people with stroke who were participants 
in the team’s previous research (n = 2), spouses of par -
ticipants from previous research (n = 3), physiotherapists 
(n = 3) and a Stroke Association Clinical Lecturer.
Suggestions from the review group included ensuring 
gender equality within the text messages and checking 
that the messages were appropriate for a heterogeneous 
group. Therapists felt that there was too much emphasis 
on walking and not enough suggestions for other types 
of activities, especially for people who are unable to 
walk outside. Other activities were subsequently added, 
e.g. home-based exercise, household chores and online 
classes. People with stroke and therapists requested more 
examples of goals for physical activity. This prompted 
an extra meeting with the PPI group to identify real-life 
goals and ways to achieve them, e.g. using clothes pegs 
to strengthen fingers and taking laundry out of the wash -
ing machine with the weak hand. All reviewers welcomed 
the quotes from other people with stroke. However, 
they pointed out that these should be not just the opin -
ion of one person but relevant and helpful to the major -
ity. Finally, people with stroke requested the addition of 
more practical tips. These included adding more infor -
mation about coping with fatigue, how to incorporate 
exercises into everyday activities, reminders to use a stick 
or walking aid if required and wearing good shoes when 
doing activities.
Step 4 Final revisions of the text message intervention  
Step 4.1 Final review and revisions in preparation for 
pilot testing Comments from the reviewers were collated 
onto a spreadsheet of the message delivery plan. Sugges -
tions for revision were collated and incorporated into the intervention. Individual messages were reviewed in the 
light of comments received and final revisions made, to 
ensure the complete intervention was coherent. The final 
intervention included 95 messages to be delivered over 
84 consecutive days.
The intervention will be delivered to people with stroke 
in two waves of pilot testing. Messages will be delivered 
via TextApp, a software tool developed by one of the 
research team (CJ), which has been used in several text 
message behaviour change intervention studies [61, 62, 
64]. The TextApp delivery system allows personalisation 
to be programmed into the message schedule, monitors 
message delivery and handles replies from participants.
Discussion
Co-production has led to an empirically and theoreti -
cally based intervention to promote and increase physical 
activity among people with stroke when formal reha -
bilitation ends. The views and perspectives of people 
with stroke and health professionals provided important 
insights into perceived barriers to physical activity and 
identified strategies to overcome them. The structured, 
multistep approach [41] highlighted areas for improve -
ment through successive rounds of review, providing an 
intervention to give people with stroke confidence and 
motivation to increase physical activity.
The intervention is made up of a discrete set of unique 
messages that all participants receive. Participants’ names 
and information about their recent or current physical 
activity goals are used to personalise some messages. The 
messages incorporate strategies to maximise meaningful 
engagement, attention and enactment [41, 65]. The inter -
vention can provide daily contact to promote physical 
activity and boost motivation at a time when people feel 
vulnerable.
The intention was to design an intervention that could 
be easily rolled out within NHS rehabilitation services, 
if shown to be effective. Text messaging is a low-cost 
intervention that would appeal to service providers if it 
could be easily administered without placing a burden on 
Table 4 Strategies to enhance engagement
Restrict the number of messages sent in a day, to avoid overloading participants
Send a message every day, so participants know what to expect
Add a few more messages to establish a relationship with the participants over the first few days
Refer to the participants’ names more frequently within texts
Sign off more messages every week using the researcher’s name (this would be a therapist for a large trial and/or at rollout of the intervention)
Add more information in text messages that would provide continuity from participants’ personal rehabilitation packages
Add more texts with hints and tips as verbatim quotes from other people with stroke, to model specific behaviours to increase physical activity
Make the therapists’ voices stronger (including quotes from physiotherapists how to achieve recommended physical activity levels)
Place more emphasis on walking, as it is one of the best forms of physical activity post-stroke, and it can be interesting, easily accessible and free

rehabilitation staff. For this reason, a decision was taken to 
include minimal tailoring to individual participants. Many 
interventions use tailoring, targeting or personalisation 
of text message content, but it remains unclear which are 
effective [28, 31, 55]. For this study, the extensive forma -
tive work with people with stroke ensured that themes 
and topics that were relevant to most people with stroke 
were identified and incorporated into the messages.
A key feature of this intervention is that it does not pre -
scribe exercises or physical activity that participants should 
undertake, nor does it provide reminders to perform activ -
ities at specific times. It is designed to support behaviour 
change using proven behaviour change techniques and 
prompts and progress review [39]. This approach differs 
from many text message interventions where the aim is 
to provide reminders or prompts to undertake tasks. In a 
recently published pilot study, the STROKEWALK study 
delivered instructional text messages to promote regular 
walking and functional leg exercises over 3 months [36]. A 
study by Kamwesiga et al. reported early pilot work, where 
reminder text messages to perform three daily activi -
ties were used as part of a family-centred intervention to 
support participation in daily activities [28, 29]. In con -
trast, our co-design processes led to a theoretically guided 
behaviour change intervention centred on participants’ 
individual goals, which should better promote and main -
tain physical activity behaviours.
Strengths and limitations
The main strength of this study was that collaborative work -
ing was used throughout the development of the interven -
tion to ensure that issues that are important to people with 
stroke were addressed. Incorporating the involvement of 
key stakeholders at all stages, particularly those with lived 
experience, maximises the acceptability and potential effec -
tiveness of an intervention [66, 67]. The intervention is theo -
retically based and uses conventional techniques to increase 
physical activity and to enhance engagement. Clinical 
guidelines and rehabilitation professionals were consulted 
on what behaviours should be addressed to increase physi -
cal activity among people with stroke.
The study design has some limitations. CWG method -
ology [42] could not be used as intended due to restric -
tions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The planned 
face-to-face meetings were substituted with online MS 
Teams meetings. These were well attended and allowed 
several people, who would be unable to travel due to 
distance or work commitments, to participate. Chang -
ing to online format, especially early in the pandemic 
when online processes were not well established, meant 
that the depth of discussion originally intended at CWG 
meetings was not possible. To mitigate this, the meetings 
were augmented with one-on-one discussion with some CWG members outside of structured group meetings. 
To develop discussion of topics raised in online meet -
ings, individuals were contacted by email, or small online 
meetings were convened.
A second limitation is that the people with stroke who par -
ticipated in the development process may not be representa -
tive of all, despite our attempts to be inclusive. Although 
some of the people who took part were sedentary, many 
were physically active, which may have influenced their atti -
tudes and therefore input to a study on physical activity.
The intervention itself may be seen to have limita -
tions. All participants will receive the same text message 
intervention, apart from a few messages that contain 
personalised information about the individuals’ experi -
ence during rehabilitation. People with stroke form a 
heterogenous group in terms of demographics, stroke 
severity and disabilities. Although messages were writ -
ten to be relevant and accessible to all, some may not be 
applicable for everyone. However, all participants will be 
keen to regain their independence, which will increase 
their ability to relate to the intervention components 
[49]. Participants will be asked to draw on what is help -
ful in the messages and disregard what is not relevant. 
Another potential limitation is that the intervention is 
partially interactive only. Study participants can respond 
to messages but will not receive replies. Responses from 
participants will be delivered to the research team, in real 
time, by email. Thus, if a participant sends a message that 
requires action, e.g. a request to stop the messages, the 
research assistant will be able to take appropriate action. 
Participants will be briefed about this prior to recruit -
ment to ensure that they are not disappointed when their 
responses are not acknowledged. Finally, we undertook 
exploratory research to investigate mobile phone use 
in people with stroke that indicated that a majority did. 
Nonetheless, many people with stroke experience cogni -
tive and communication difficulties that may exclude use 
and participation in this intervention.
Conclusion
Co-design processes were used to systematically develop 
a theory and evidence-based intervention. This co-design 
approach could be used to develop interventions for 
other heath behaviours and with different populations. 
The next stages will test the intervention for acceptability, 
feasibility and effectiveness.
