Abstract
Background: Studies have shown that supporting parents in pediatric oncology reduces family distress following a
cancer diagnosis. Manualized programs for parents have therefore been developed to reduce family distress.
However, these programs have limitations that need to be improved, such as better defining programs ’procedures,
developing interventions focusing on parents ’conjugal relationship, conducting rigorous evaluations of
implementation, and proposing adaptations to various cultural dimensions. According to the Obesity-Related
Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for the development of behavioral intervention, we improved these
limitations and developed TAKING BACK CONTROL TOGETHER, a six in-person intervention sessions to support
parents of children with cancer by taking the active components of two programs: Bright IDEAS and SCCIP.
Referring to the redesign phase of the ORBIT model, this study aims to refine the definition of this program ’s
design by interviewing parents and healthcare professionals.
Methods: In order to refine the program, we used a sequential mixed-methods study. Parents and healthcare
professionals first completed questionnaires assessing the program, and then discussed its limitations, benefits, and
areas for improvement in group and/or individual interviews. We performed a descriptive thematic content analysis
of the qualitative data from the open-ended questions (questionnaires and interviews) with NVivo 11 to categorize
recommendations for the program refinement.
Results: The results showed that components seemed pertinent to final users. The main areas needing
improvement were the level of complexity and understandability of the parent manual, the possibility to choose
the place and time of the intervention, and the lack of ethnic/cultural diversity. Changes to the program were
made accordingly.

Conclusions: It is necessary to include end-users when developing complex intervention programs designed for
vulnerable populations and sensitive clinical contexts. Following the present refinement, we now have a treatment
package, which is safe and acceptable for the target population and has a better chance of yielding a clinically
significant benefit for users in a future pilot study.

Background
Distress in parents who are confronted with their child ’s
cancer diagnosis is characterized by a wide range of symp-
toms such as stress, uncertainty, loss of control, anxiety,
depression, and traumatic symptoms [ 1–3]. According to
studies, this distress is related to difficulties in parents ’
ability to adapt to the oncological situation and being
overwhelmed in the management of daily life [ 4,5]. Stud-
ies have also shown that mixed parental distress, consist-
ing of anxiety, depression and traumatic stress, is
associated with long-term distress and adaptive difficulties
in the child himself/herself, as well as impaired school
functioning [ 6–8]. In addition to each parent ’s distress,
studies have also highlighted the specificities of conjugal
distress in pediatric oncology [ 9,10]. Parents ’intimacy,
sexuality, time, and activities were negatively influenced
by the child ’s cancer. Importantly, it has been shown that
spousal support on the current emotional and conjugal
adjustment of each spouse improves the couples ’function-
ing in both the short and long term [ 11]. These findings
are in line with the reduction in psychological distress and
conjugal conflict, and a greater satisfaction with marital
life observed among both fathers and mothers who per-
ceived increased support from their spouse [ 12].
These studies suggest that it is crucial to support par-
ents, treat their distress as early as possible, and promote
unity and marital adjustment to maximize family resili-
ence to childhood cancer. In order to evaluate the psy-
chosocial support offered to parents, we conducted a
systematic review to identify evidenced-based manua-
lized programs that had been developed, and how they
were designed and implemented in pediatric oncology
clinics [ 13]. We identified 11 manualized intervention
programs designed to support parents following their
child’s cancer diagnosis. These programs followed vari-
ous models of change including cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, and systemic therapy.
An in-depth analysis of existing intervention programs,
their structure, and tools, as well as their hypotheses of
change has highlighted multiple limitations in their def-
inition of a design that needs improvement. On the one
hand, a number of programs did not consider extant
components with documented implementation and ef-
fects. Other programs did not always accuratelydocument how targets and models of change were se-
lected. On the other hand, several programs lacked a de-
sign refinement as well as pre-test and test phases that
would have improved their acceptability, feasibility, and
effectiveness. Finally, the programs were mostly defined
for a specific population and were therefore not applic-
able to individuals from different cultures. This review ’s
results are available in another publication [ 13].
Based on this review, we retained two programs, Bright
IDEAS and SCCIP , which have the best effects on their
primary outcomes and are the only ones recommended by
the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) [ 14,15]. Bright
IDEAS is an intervention program based on
problem-solving skills training (PSST). Although Bright
IDEAS has excellent NCI scores on dissemination (5/5)
and research integrity (4.4/5), this program still bears limi-
tations. Firstly, because it is only offered to mothers and
administered individually, it received a limited impact
score (2/5). Secondly, because it is relatively burdensome
and somewhat repetitive (eight in-person sessions), the
dropout rate was high (42%) [ 16]. SCCIP is based on the
principles of CBT and systemic therapy. SCCIP relies on
different activities based on family interventions aiming to
improve coping and marital/intrafamily communication.
For instance, it relies on multiple family discussion groups
which suggest conducting a group discussion to clarify
parental functions. This activity ’ss t r e n g t hi si t s
family-oriented approach which helps families cope with
cancer [ 17,18]. SCCIP has received fair NCI scores on re-
search integrity (3.6/5) and dissemination (4/5), but a
lower score on impact (1.3/5) [ 19]. The manual remains
largely general with regards to the complexity required for
communicational interventions in the family and lacks im-
portant details about the specific interventions to be car-
ried out. Thus, it is difficult for professionals to use the
interventions prescribed by this program in a systematic
way. Of note, Bright IDEAS was developed in two lan-
guages (English and Spanish), whereas SCCIP was only
developed in English. Like the vast majority (8/11) of
available interventions, these programs were developed
for a North American population which raises questions
about these programs ’transferability to individuals who
are from different cultural backgrounds or who do not
speak English and/or Spanish [ 13].Ogez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 2 of 14
Based on these observations, we addressed these pro-
grams ’limitations by combining their most effective pro-
cedures and translating them into a program better suited
for a French-speaking population in pediatric oncology
[20]. In order to translate and correctly articulate these
programs, members of our team were trained in both pro-
grams and met with the respective authors. The resulting
program was therefore a new integrative intervention of-
fering an active approach to meet parental needs. Several
frameworks have been formalized for optimizing interven-
tions [ 21–23]. Among these, Obesity-Related Behavioral
Intervention Trials (ORBIT) is a complete evaluation
model for intervention programs which explicitly de-
scribes the preliminary stages of program development
[24]. This model consists of four phases: I, program defin-
ition phase; II, preliminary tests; III, efficacy studies; and
IV, effectiveness studies. Phase I, in which the program is
defined, consists of two stages: Ia, the definition, and Ib,
the refinement of the design. With regard to the definition
of the new program, TAKING BACK CONTROL
TOGETHER, we followed the ORBIT phase Irecommendations: 1, definition of the target population; 2,
selection of the program ’s primary and secondary inter-
vention targets of; 3, justification for the choice of models
of change and their translation into interventional proce-
dures; and 4, development of a coherent program com-
prising these procedures [ 25]. In order to standardize the
administration of this intervention, we also created a man-
ual for practitioners and parents, consistent with standard
practice in behavioral sciences [ 26].
TAKING BACK CONTROL TOGETHER aims to
strengthen parents ’sense of control and PSST (hetero-
sexual and homosexual couples) and focus on dyadic
coping to prevent distress. This program is based on
cognitive behavioral and systemic theories. It includes
six sessions: four individual sessions, offered to each par-
ent, and two couple sessions (see Fig. 1). The individual
sessions focus on PSST, as well as acquiring, developing,
and maintaining simple problem-solving skills to meet
the needs of families facing childhood cancer. PSST in-
cludes six stages: 1 —problem selection; 2 —problem def-
inition and operationalization; 3 —generation of possible

solutions; 4 —decision-making; 5 —solution implementa-
tion; and 6 —effectiveness evaluation [ 27]. These ses-
sions take place at the hospital during the child ’s
treatment. They can also be offered to single-parent
families. Both couple sessions are based on CBT and
systemic therapy. They aim to enhance parents ’com-
munication and resilience by improving their ability
to manage real difficulties associated with childhood
cancer together [ 9,28]. Couple sessions are provided
either at the hospital or at the parents ’residence ac-
cording to the parents ’preference. In blended fam-
ilies, each parent can participate in the program with
their new partner. A manual for healthcare profes-
sionals (provider manual) provides specific instruc-
tions for each intervention to be used in every
program session. Furthermore, the provider manual
offers numerous transcripts examples to convey the
information to parents adequately and in a standard-
ized manner. A manual for parents includes PSST
toolkits for individual and couple sessions, as well as
strategies related to communication and dyadic cop-
ing. Three illustrations are also available: (1) a video about
a canoe trip disturbed by bad weather to illustrate
problem-solving steps; (2) a written clinical vignette illus-
trating an example of how a problem related to a child ’s
cancer is solved by the parents; and (3) a video in which
parents of children with cancer discuss the challenges they
face in their conjugal relationship. A complete description
of this intervention ’s design definition is available in a
study report [ 20].
Following the intervention ’s definition, design refine-
ment is an essential step in program development that is
also necessary to document. The intervention ’s design
refinement (ORBIT phase Ib) aims to identify essential
treatment components, determine aspects related to its
administration (such as its frequency and duration for
example), and improve its strength and efficiency [ 24].
The milestones to achieve in order to move to the fol-
lowing step (preliminary testing of the ORBIT phase II)
is to have established the treatment package ’s essential
components, to ensure that it is safe and acceptable for
the target population, and that it is likely to produce a
clinically significant positive effect on the target. During
these preliminary tests, we will conduct a pilot test
which will assess the new program ’s acceptability and
feasibility. Following these preliminary tests, efficacy
(ORBIT phase III) and effectiveness (ORBIT phase IV)
studies could be conducted.
The study ’s main objective was to refine TAKING
BACK CONTROL TOGETHER following interviews
with end-users: pediatric oncology healthcare profes-
sionals and parents of children with cancer. Specifically,
this study aimed to (1) evaluate and (2) provide sugges-
tions to improve the program ’s relevance, acceptability,material, practical implementation, and technique
procedures [ 29].
Methods
Procedures and participants
Participants
We recruited a convenience sample of healthcare profes-
sionals and parents through internal email and online
social media, respectively. A post was published on
the Leucan Facebook page, a community support
organization for children with cancer. The post in-
vited parents to participate in the study and outlined
the study ’s inclusion criteria. Such recruitment pro-
cedure is frequent with populations who are difficult
to reach and allows participants to take part in the
s t u d yo nav o l u n t a r yb a s i s[ 30].
To be included in this study, healthcare professionals
had to be members of the hematology-oncology staff
and have worked for more than a year in the pediatric
field. We included one participant from each of the fol-
lowing practices: medical, nursing, social, psychological,
physiotherapy, and volunteering team. Parents included
in the study had to have a child in remission for at least
6 months and the ability to speak French. The decision
to gather experiences from parents whose children are
in remission is associated with the desire to evaluate
the program ’s components with participants who are
somewhat at some distance of their experience with
pediatric cancer. By having more perspective on the
disease, they are able to share the experience they have
lived at different times, from diagnosis to remission. In-
formation power was reached through pertinence of se-
lected participants and not by the importance of their
number [ 31].
Procedures
A sequential mixed-method design was used to assess
the program. Mixed questionnaires with closed- and
open-ended questions as well as directive interviews (in-
dividual, couple, and group) were employed. First, we
met healthcare professionals, then we met the parents.
Meeting healthcare professionals first and parents sec-
ond is a decision supported by the criterion of methodo-
logical coherence and by clinical evidence. We wanted
to have clinicians ’opinion to avoid any inconsistency
with the care of parents.
Healthcare professionals included in this study were

first step was a 30-min information session about the
project. Beforehand, they had received documentation
on the program to become acquainted with it. The
documentation consisted in provider and parent man-
uals as well as intervention tools. As a second step,
they were invited to complete an evaluationOgez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 4 of 14
questionnaire in paper format (described below). The
third step was to take part in a focus group investi-
gating the questionnaire ’sm a i nt h e m e sa n df o c u s i n g
on elements that had been negatively evaluated in
step two, i.e., the providers were invited to discuss
these elements and to suggest ways to improve them.
This focus group was conducted by two researchers
(DO, RR), audio recorded and transcribed.
After completing the focus group with the profes-
sionals, the same two researchers (DO, RR) met with the
parents. Given the difficulty of finding a time that suited
all parents for a group interview, only individual or
couple sessions were conducted. The procedure of these
meetings was as follows. Firstly, participating parents
were contacted by phone to introduce the intervention
and verify the inclusion criteria. Secondly, a brief de-
scription of the study, the parent manual, intervention
tools, and the parent questionnaire were sent to them by
email or surface mail. After having read the documents,
parents were asked to complete an evaluation question-
naire in PDF format on their computer or tablet (de-
scribed below). Thirdly, 1 week after the initial contact
and the description of the program, interviews with par-
ents were conducted to discuss both the questionnaire ’s
results and the comments made earlier by professionals.
We also asked for their input as to how to improve the
intervention accordingly. When parents were unable to
come to the hospital, a 1-h meeting following the same
structure was offered by phone. These sessions were
audio recorded and transcribed. Finally, after data ana-
lysis was completed, the intervention program ’s manuals
and tools were improved following the participants ’
suggestions.
Participating parents were compensated for their par-
ticipation. Healthcare professionals did not want to re-
ceive financial compensation for their participation.
Therefore, a donation of 30$ was made to an association
of their choice. The CHU Sainte-Justine Ethics Commit-
tee approved this project.
Measures
Socio-demographic information was collected for this
study. For healthcare professionals, we collected occupa-
tion, age, and years of experience. For parents, we col-
lected marital status, number of children, occupation,
work status, and the date of diagnosis.
The research team also created two questionnaires by
adapting questions used in previous studies [ 32,33]. The
questionnaire for healthcare professionals included 50
items grouped into four categories to evaluate the pro-
gram ’s relevance and acceptability (6 items, e.g., “the
program is adequate to deal with difficulties experienced
during childhood cancer ”), the program material (5
items each about provider and parents ’manual as wellas intervention tools, e.g., “the manual provides suffi-
cient information to parents, program tools are easy to
use”), the program ’s practical implementation (8 items,
e.g., “you could invest in the six-week program ”), and
the expected effects of its procedures (21 items, e.g., “the
program would have taught you something useful ”).
Responses were provided on a 6-level scale, from 0
“strongly disagree ”to 5 “strongly agree. ”For each
topic, space was available to allow participants to
write comments.
Parents ’questionnaire was the same as the one com-
pleted by healthcare professionals with the exception
that it did not contain any questions about the provider
manual and included more questions about the pro-
gram ’s expected effects. Parents ’questionnaire included
49 items grouped into four categories: the program ’s
relevance and acceptability (6 items), the program ’s ma-
terial (5 items about parents ’manual and 5 about inter-
vention tools), the program ’s practical implementation (8
items) and the expected effects of its procedures (23
multiple choice items and two open-ended items, e.g.,
“how do you rate problem solving as a relevant skill to
help parents of children with cancer? ”). The response
format was the same as for professionals.
Analyses
Quantitative data were analyzed using descripti ve statistics
(frequencies) in order to identi fy and prioritize the critical
elements to be discussed in the interviews. Qualitative data
from the open-ended questions (questionnaires) and tran-
scriptions (interviews) were processed and encoded using
NVivo 11 software by analysts who received appropriate
training specifically for this project [ 34]. An emergent the-
matic analysis method was used, and the transcript coding
process followed these steps: (1) outlining of the significant
critical categories for descrip tive analysis; (2) encoding of
the transcript by two authors separately (DO, RR); (3) com-
pletion of two meetings to discuss and evaluate the
inter-rater agreement and the themes selections between
the authors by consensus (DO, CJB, RR); (4) recoding of
the transcript following each meeting, based on established
guidelines and code descriptions; (5) development of the
hierarchy of the three central themes (parents ’experience,
evaluation of the program, suggestions for improvement);
(6) reduction and synthesis of the data for each theme; (7) a
preliminary drafting of the results incorporating quotes that
had been transcribed without the markers of spoken lan-
guage to allow for a more fluid reading [ 35].
Quantitative results relate to the average scores of the
main topics assessed by questionnaires (total score for
each item is 5). They are summarized in a table and pre-
sented in context with the qualitative results. The first
section of the result from qualitative data is presented in
a narrative form. Participants are identified usingOgez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 5 of 14
alphanumeric codes (P1 to P6 for parents and H1 to H6
for healthcare professionals) [ 36]. Short quotes were em-
bedded in the text in quotation marks, and longer
quotes are presented in a distinct paragraph.
Results
Participants
Six of the 22 healthcare professionals who were invited
agreed to participate in this study. In order to have a sam-
ple that adequately reflects the diversity of healthcare pro-
fessionals in pediatric oncology, the researchers ensured
the sample ’s internal diversity by recruiting a representa-
tive from various professions: a doctor (H1), a psycholo-
gist (H2), a social worker (H3), a nurse (H4), a
physiotherapist (H5), and a librarian of a pediatric oncol-
ogy foundation (H6). These professionals were in average
48 ± 9.5 years old and had 20.3 ± 8.5 years of experience.
Twelve parents responded to the invitation to partici-
pate in this study. Of these responses, six parents —two
married heterosexual couples (P1, P2; P3, P4) and two
mothers; one married (P5) and one divorced (P6) —who
had lived through their child ’s cancer experience agreed
to participate and were included in the study. Both cou-
ples were interviewed at the hospital and the two
mothers participated by phone, as they were unable to
come to the hospital for these appointments. Parents re-
ported an average age of 45.3 ± 8.4 years. Concerning the
parents ’professional activities, there were two biologists,
one nurse, one specialized educator, one electrician, and
one without employment. Parents who were not in-
cluded in this study (six people) indicated that they lived
too far away from the hospital to participate in the re-
search interviews, were no longer interested following
the phone call, or did not respond following the mailing
of the documents.
Qualitative analysis of parents ’experience
Both healthcare professionals and parents began by talk-
ing about the parents ’experience. In summary, parents
reported having experienced a significant shock at the
time of the diagnosis, which caused emotional overload
and a loss of control. The complexity and quantity of in-
formation received by parents also increase this overload
and may cause a feeling of uncertainty. In response to
this emotional difficulty, some parents reported having
used problem- (or conflict-) solving strategies on their
own or within their couple. The importance of control
in the search for information or in discussions with spe-
cialists was also pointed out. In addition, aspects of
marital/family coping were raised, such as the import-
ance of maintaining unity and intimacy within the
couple, communicating well and sustaining family rou-
tines. Time also allows one to adapt to this situation.Program evaluation
Responses to questionnaires assessing the program
showed average scores for healthcare professionals
and parents (see Table 1). As a conclusion to these
quantitative results, several topics were raised to be
discussed in focus groups and interviews, including
the program ’s relevance and acceptability, the useful-
ness and the writing styles of both manuals, the pro-
gram ’s practical implementation, and the expected
effects of the procedures on parents.
Program relevance and acceptability
Healthcare professionals and parents positively evaluated
the program ’s relevance and acceptability ( M= 3.8/5 and
3/5 respectively). Firstly, several benefits were observed
among professionals and parents. According to all health
professionals, this program will provide parents with
psychological support and help them better manage the
emotions related to their child ’s medical situation. It will
also be beneficial in supporting parents in the daily man-
agement of their sick child ’s situation; in helping themTable 1 Average scores of the responses to the questionnaires

cope with treatments, and in planning and organizing
the child ’s return home. One healthcare professional
(H4) believes that the program will also contribute to
the management of resources because it “can be con-
nected with the standard social services. ”This percep-
tion is shared with parents, who appreciated the fact
that the program aims to help them take back control,
especially in the management of the practical difficulties
they face (work interruptions, daily tasks, child care).
One couple (P3, P4) expected benefits even following
the illness and their return to work as well as the possi-
bility of “later generalizing their newly acquired skills. ”
Another benefit highlighted by parents is the manage-
ment of emotions, including sadness, which the program
promotes targets. One mother (P6) pointed out that “the
disease brings out despair and the intervention helps
manage despair. ”She added that for her, the sense of
control was associated with the fact that parents must
be available for their child and must try to provide them
with the best possible environment. Another mother
(P2) saw the program as an opportunity for necessary
and beneficial downtime:
P2:“Being able to sit down and have a tool to commu-
nicate while remaining cool-headed because it is always
intense …it can have positive effects. ”
Parents also confirmed the choice of the target audi-
ence. Two couples (P1, P2) (P3, P4) supported the idea
that this program should be offered to parents who are
experiencing the most trouble (in distress), separated
couples and single-parent families. One father (P3) also
noted that pediatric cancer spares no particular group:
P3:“The disease affects everyone, millionaires, and dis-
advantaged people who already have problems. ”
On the other hand, healthcare professionals reported
that a potential difficulty with the problem-solving tech-
nique was the way it would be applied by parents. For
most of them, the model of the program is not flexible
or adaptable enough to the realities of some parents:
H5:“Should we consider a shorter and longer program
to adapt to the realities and problems encountered?
Moreover, what if [the parents are] in denial of the prob-
lem or problems? How do we avoid turning it into a psy-
chotherapy session? I think a lot will depend on where
the parents were pre-diagnosis. ”
Additionally, according to the healthcare professionals
(H4, H5, H6), it is better to avoid using words and ex-
pressions that are too related to school vocabulary in
this program such as “homework ”when speaking of the
prescription of tasks to complete at home, the term
“resolution ”in the technique ’s title used in the individual
sessions or the word “problem, ”as these terms may have
a negative connotation and influence the course of the
sessions as well as the patients ’mood. This vision was
not shared by all parents; only one mother (P4) arguedthat the program must also address how to talk to
parents:
P4:“The word calm, for example, you know when
someone is angry and then you ask: are you calm? …
you are pffff …”
Program material
In general, the usefulness of the parent manual was rated
very positively by healthcare professionals ( M=4 . 1 / 5 )a n d
by parents ( M= 4.6/5). On the other hand, the writing
style of the parent manual was the subject of several re-
marks from healthcare professionals ( M= 2.8/5), while it
was rated very positively by the parents ( M= 5/5). Indeed,
healthcare professionals indicated that some parents in
the target population could have difficulties understanding
and dealing with the vocabulary, the writing style, and the
amount of reading of this manual.
H1:“The paragraphs were too long. Look at, for ex-
ample, the stuff on LaPresse or the BBC, paragraphs are
three lines, four lines, maximum. If they are stressed in-
dividuals, you cannot have long paragraphs like that. ”
H4:“Parents have many things to read with the diag-
nosis, with the drugs and the treatments...You read
about the diagnosis, you read about the medications,
you read about the care that is the thing. ”
The majority of interviewed parents approved of the
program ’s manualized aspect and the utilization of work-
sheets that allowed them to expand their learning and
knowledge of the program outside of the in-person ses-
sions, as well as to have the choice to participate as a
couple or individually. One mother added that everyone
could use the manual when the right time comes:
P4:“When the person is alone, the brain is relaxed,
while the little one is sleeping in his room, it can be
good to see this. ”
Moreover, according to several healthcare profes-
sionals, the cognitive impact related to the level of dis-
tress is also to be taken into account when writing the
manual. One healthcare professional (H4) argued that
the presentation should remain simple because, for at
least the first 4 weeks following the diagnosis, the par-
ents are in “survival mode. ”Some parents also expressed
doubts about their ability to learn in this context:
P1:“Of course there could be parents who would not
be able to read this, that is for sure. ”
P6:“When we learn about our child ’s cancer, we be-
come less intelligent (for a while). ”
Practical implementation
Healthcare professionals and parents reported different
judgments on the practical modalities of the intervention
program. Healthcare professionals were satisfied with the
conduct of program ’s sessions at the hospital ( M=3 . 3 / 5 )
and at home ( M= 3.3/5). Parents highlighted severalOgez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 7 of 14
advantages concerning this topic. They generally appreci-
ated having the flexibility to choose the location of the
intervention program either at the hospital ( M=4 . 5 / 5 )o r
at home ( M= 4/5) for the individual and couple inter-
views. The overload caused by the medical situation is
already very demanding, and one mother (P2) mentioned
that offering the opportunity to hold couple meetings at
home in the evening can make a difference because “it’s
one less trip for people living outside of the city. ”With re-
spect to individual sessions, one mother (P4) indicated the
benefits she sees in having them at the hospital:
P4:“The hours and days at the hospital get long, so
there is a lot of time for the meetings. ”
The proposed time to start the intervention —approxi-
mately 4 weeks post-diagnosis and adjustable according to
the parents ’needs —was satisfactory for healthcare profes-
sionals (M= 3/5) and positively perceived by parents ( M=
4/5). According to one mother (P5), it is appropriate to
allow a minimum period of 3 weeks following the diagno-
sis, which allows people to “breathe a little, between visits
to the hospital and very intense worrying. ”Healthcare
professionals (H4, H5) stressed the importance of being
flexible in planning the program and in offering choices to
parents because for some of them “it is intrusive, invasive. ”
Because each family is different, parents do not all react
t h es a m ew a yo ra tt h es a m ep a c e :
H5:“There may be families who take action right after
the diagnosis, and maybe this kind of program could be
beneficial very early on. However, others may be com-
pletely frozen following the diagnosis, so it takes more
time before we can accompany them to move forward. ”
Conversely, healthcare professionals reported more
reservations than the majority of parents on this topic.
They mentioned the parents ’lack of availability to par-
ticipate in the program. According to some of them, par-
ents may decline to participate in order to focus all of
their available time on their sick child, their marital rela-
tionship, and on other family members. One father (P1)
also shared this point of view:
P1:“Basically, the way I see it is that one of the two
should be available... I do not think it is realistic that it
be the father and the mother actually. ”
Another concern expressed was regarding holding
meetings at home. Contrary to parents (P1, P2) who ap-
proved of the importance of giving parents a choice as
to the location of the intervention, healthcare profes-
sionals expressed doubts regarding the relevance of in-
terventions at the parents ’home. Some believe that the
presence of a healthcare professional could be intrusive
in the family dynamics, could increase the parents ’over-
load, and could cause them to feel evaluated, judged, or
forced merely to tidy up their home. One father (P1)
also pointed out that there might be parents “who really
do not want you to go to their home... ”In general, the number of sessions was deemed satis-
factory ( M= 3/5 for healthcare professionals and M= 3.6
/5 for parents). However, it was considered high for one
of the couples that were interviewed (P1, P2), who
thinks that it should be adapted according to availability
and need:
P1:“It depends on the person ’s needs or level of dis-
ruption. You know, if you can tell that the person has
never lost control, you do not need six sessions. Then
there are some who have never had that kind of contro-
l...and somehow it could serve them. ”
Finally, participants mentioned no limitations concern-
ing the program ’s components. The prescription of tasks
to complete at home, however, was the subject of differ-
ing opinions: too demanding according to professionals
(M= 2.8/5) but relevant according to parents ( M= 3.8/
5), especially to one mother:
H3:“At times, parents already have too much to learn:
learning how to use the central venous catheter, learning
how to use the feeding tubes, learning so many new
things that they need to do at home. ”
P2:“The homework is good. I think it is a good work-
load ( …) It circles in your head; you figure out what issue
you would like to work on. So, I don ’t think it is too much
because you do not actually need to write it all. We will
think about it if we receive the intervention. ”
Program procedures
All participants felt that the program ’s individual com-
ponent is relevant and very much in line with the goal
that had been defined, i.e., to strengthen parents ’sense
of control. Participants evaluated the individual sessions
positively. They help to improve the sense of control (for
healthcare professionals, M= 4.3/5; for parents, M= 3.2/
5) and PSST (for healthcare professionals, M= 4.8/5; for
parents, M= 3.8/5). For healthcare professionals (H4,
H5), the individual sessions are important because they
make it possible to present the approach thoroughly. For
parents, these meetings allow them to speak more
openly and help them express anxiety and regulate their
emotions. One mother (P2) mentioned that the parents ’
well-being depends on the child ’s medical situation and
that they “must learn to live with cancer. ”Another
mother (P5) suggested that these sessions will allow
them to take back control over emotions and thus be
better equipped to support their child:
P5:“To better manage, you cannot talk about accept-
ance because it is hard to accept. We should instead take
back control over our functioning. ”
Participants also considered the two couple sessions
relevant. They believed that these sessions strengthen
the couple ’s unity (for healthcare professionals, M= 4.3/
5, for parents, M= 3.6/5). Many parents believed that
marital communication will be improved following theseOgez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 8 of 14
sessions, which will help them in the management of
couple crises and misunderstandings. One mother (P5)
stated that as soon as the diagnosis is announced, par-
ents need to be able to communicate and cooperate to-
gether and that the program can enrich the relationship
and optimize their ability to “communicate without
judgment. ”One mother (P6) also mentioned that it is
essential to prioritize the couple because the disease
takes up considerable space and there are few moments
when the couple can get together to talk because, in her
point of view, “it is important to have a joint approach. ”
One couple (P3, P4) mentioned that most of the time,
one parent is at the hospital and the other at home, but
that they still need to meet to discuss the rest of the
family, who are often neglected in this context, and that
the program helps create a “moment together. ”
Parents also approved being assigned tasks to
complete at home, on the condition that the tasks are
not imposed and do not add to the overload. As one
mother emphasized (P5), these tasks should be com-
pleted “only if the person wants to do them, if they feel
energized. ”
Program provider ’s attitude
The program provider ’s attitude was discussed during
focus groups and interviews. According to healthcare
professionals, it is essential for the intervention pro-
vider to take the time to build a warm and trusting
relationship with the parents. They believe that such
a program must be flexible and that the program pro-
vider must adapt to the parents they meet on a
case-by-case basis. Parents shared the same view re-
garding the program provider ’s attitude. This moment
of initial contact is essential to enable them to reveal
themselves. Most parents also stressed the importance
of this preliminary step before the intervention begins
to promote contact:
P5:“Parents will definitely need much support and
perhaps one or two meetings to allow them to open up
with a trained professional that can listen to them and
guide them. ”
In summary, the interviewed parents highlighted the
following program benefits: (1) the relevance of the pro-
gram ’s main target, (2) the complementary of the inter-
vention ’s individual and couple components, (3) the
training in taking back control over the long term which
can be used beyond the cancer context, (4) the relevance
of the target audience selection (distressed parents in-
cluding single-parent families), (5) the program ’s manua-
lized aspect (in particular by proposing a manual to
parents), and (6) the program provider ’s empathetic atti-
tude. According to healthcare professionals, reported
drawbacks included (1) the intervention program could
be an overload for parents (e.g., completion ofhomework), (2) the wording of the parent manual is
considered too long and complicated in its writing style,
(3) sessions at the parents ’homes are not always feasible.
In this case, some adjustments will be necessary.
Suggestions for program improvement
Suggestions for improving manuals
One healthcare professional (H1) suggested improving
the provider manual by simplifying the technical writing
style so that it is accessible to various healthcare profes-
sionals (doctors, nurses, social workers).
With regard to the parent ’s manual, all of the profes-
sionals and two mothers (P4, P6) suggested simplifying
and reducing the texts. The document should contain
fewer pages and more illustrations. It was also suggested
to avoid using terms that are reminiscent of school in this
manual, for example, the word “homework. ”Some profes-
sionals (H1, H3, H4) stressed that the language used must
be accessible to everyone even if their level of literacy or
proficiency in French is weak. The style should therefore
be simplified and the text “written at a grade 4 level ”(H1).
Additionally, although two couples (P1, P2) (P3, P4)
judged the writing style to be simple, they were able to see
how difficult it could be for other parents and also sug-
gested simplifying the document. Two professionals (H2,
H4) also indicated that it would be better to offer a 4-page
double-sided booklet rather than a manual that may be
too complex and confusing for parents. One professional
(H1) suggested replacing the manual with documents in a
video format. Finally, all healthcare professionals and one
couple (P3, P4) proposed to make the manual more at-
tractive for parents to facilitate their adherence to the pro-
gram. They suggested a shorter, more fun and simple
manual, going straight to the point, and using codes they
already know:
P4:“You know...like in a comic book it is always carica-
tural, and so at one point when you are reading, it makes
you smile, it makes you feel good, you can relax... ”
Suggestions for improving toolkits and illustrations
Professionals and parents provided suggestions for im-
proving worksheets. One healthcare professional (H1)
emphasized the importance of allowing more freedom
by avoiding the ranking of solutions: “we could put more
emphasis on the generation of ideas before evaluating
them. ”More specifically, it would mean letting parents
brainstorm solutions as they are asked to do in the
process of selecting problems to solve. On the other
hand, one couple (P3, P4) suggested that these leaflets
also include codes that are already familiar in pediatrics:
P4:“You know in oncology; the nurse gives me tools
with smiley faces and emoticons that speaks to me. ”
Healthcare professionals and parents suggested im-
proving illustration. First, healthcare professionalsOgez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 9 of 14
expressed reservations about the choice of the canoe
trip to illustrate the use of PSST; this metaphor hav-
ing little impact because “there are few people who
go on canoe trips ”(H1). They therefore suggested
that it is necessary to ensure adequate cultural adap-
tation by mobilizing more familiar concepts such as
mountains or other concepts:
H2:“For the canoe metaphor, travel is good, but if
you’re dealing with a variety of multicultural realities,
the canoe will not mean anything, and maybe variants
could help...like cars, horses, etc. ”
Second, one healthcare professional (H4) and one
mother (P2) recommended proposing other case studies
or a larger variety of cases to create “an image bank. ”
However, the other healthcare professionals argued that
the case study is quite broad and representative of the
clinical reality of many parents. It is therefore considered
more useful not to integrate case studies in the program
documents and to instead offer them alternative exam-
ples during sessions in a personalized way, i.e., in keep-
ing with the lived experience of the parent encountered.
In fact, one mother (P2) explained that she “finds it
helpful to read examples of plausible situations. ”
In summary, professionals and parents offered sugges-
tions on improving textbooks, tools and program illus-
trations. They recommended simplifying the writing of
both manuals, shortening, and making them more ap-
pealing with illustrations, specifically for the parent
manual. Regarding the worksheets, they recommended
allowing more freedom to generate solutions without
imposing a hierarchization immediately and using codes
known by patients as those proposed on medical records
in pediatric oncology. As for illustrations, they suggested
more clinical cases and better adaptation to the patient ’s
culture. The Table 2summarizes the evaluations and the
modifications made to the intervention program.
Discussion
In line with recommendations on program development,
we refined the design of TAKING BACK CONTROL
TOGETHER, a manualized intervention program to re-
duce parental distress in pediatric oncology [ 20,24]. Fol-
lowing data collection, responses to questionnaires and
focus groups or interviews with professionals and par-
ents, we identified strengths and limitations, and col-
lected suggestions for modifications of the intervention.
The results support the pertinence of the intervention.
The concept of the program and its components aim to
restore control through individual sessions that offer
PSST and maintain unity within parents ’couples by re-
inforcing dyadic coping and marital communication dur-
ing the couple sessions. The results also highlighted
benefits such as offering emotional support, and an op-
portunity to take back long-term control, i.e., wellbeyond the oncological treatments. The benefits also
concerned the relevance of offering support for parents
with high levels of distress while including single-parent
families; and the program ’s manualized aspect, which
promotes its transmission to healthcare professionals
and parents alike. These aspects were considered rele-
vant by participants. They are also consistent with rec-
ommendations about psychological interventions in the
area of pediatric cancer [ 37,38]. Participants highlighted
some limitations, including the fact that this interven-
tion could be an additional burden for some, that the
wording of the parent manual used a writing style diffi-
cult to understand, and was probably too detailed. Par-
ticipants also questioned the feasibility of meeting
parents at home for the couple sessions. Although these
limitations did not challenge the acceptability and rele-
vance of the program, they could be barriers to the par-
ticipation of some highly distressed parents.
To address these limitations, modifications were made
with respect to the comments and improvement tips
provided by the participants. Firstly, the writing style of
both provider and parent manuals have been simplified
to provide the reader with a better understanding. We
removed technical language from the provider manual
to make it more accessible for all professionals including
nurses, social workers, or counselors. The parent manual
text was simplified in its writing to make it more under-
standable for a wide range of people in Canada whose
mother tongue is not French. Consistent with the fact
that training in therapeutic procedures requires a thera-
peutic relationship and active participation, distinct from
a teacher-student relationship [ 14,27], we removed
school-like terms. The parent manual was also simpli-
fied, and more illustrations were integrated. The pro-
gram ’s video clips are being recorded in order to
propose an electronic version of the manual accessible
through a dedicated internet platform, in coherence with
other manualized programs that offer computerized ver-
sions in the same field [ 39–41]. Secondly, the “generat-
ing solutions ”worksheet no longer requires direct
ranking from parents. This is required after the gener-
ation of solutions. In line with the spirit of PSST [ 27],
parents can thus search for solutions more freely, with-
out there being a risk of self-censorship linked to a pre-
mature evaluation of the feasibility of this type of
solution. In fact, PSST including the search for solutions
requires the patient to stop and think freely [ 14,27].
Thirdly, the canoe trip metaphor and case studies are
being adapted to the parents ’cultural background. In
order to promote a connection with the illustrations
made in the program, it is indeed useful to propose con-
texts that are close to the parents ’experiences. This way,
we are aligning ourselves with the intercultural psycho-
logical interventions field, which supports theOgez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 10 of 14

Theme Benefits Limitations and suggestions for
improvementSuggestions for modifications
1—Program relevance and acceptability
Emotional support Aim of the program: psychological
and emotional support for parents
Regain control Improve parental capacity in the
management of everyday practical
difficulties
Target audience According to parents: couples and
single-parent families are targets con-
sistent with the nature of the difficul-
ties encountered in pediatric
oncologyAccording to healthcare professionals:
it is possible that the program may
not be adaptable to the reality of
some parents (overload)The program will be more adaptable
in order to respect the parents ’reality:
flexibility regarding appointment
times, session location, and
“homework ”requirements
2—Program material
Provider manual The manualized aspect is appreciated Terminology is too reminiscent of
school (e.g., homework)
Avoid using technical terms so that it
is accessible to non-psychologistsModify the school-like terms ( “home-
work ”replaced with “tasks to
complete at home ”) and techniques
in the manual (e.g., operationalization
of the problem replaced with charac-
teristic of the problem)
Parent manual Helps expand learning and
knowledge of the program outside of
sessionsAccording to healthcare professionals:
too complex, too extensive, and the
general level of writing style is too
elevated for some parents:
Simplify writing (aim for grade 4 level),
reduce the amount of text and
present it in a four-page booklet, re-
move the terms that are too compli-
cated, and add illustrations to make it
more attractiveRewrite in a simpler way and create a
computerized version and video
capsules illustrating the program
sessions. The print format will be
smaller and include illustrations.
Worksheets Helps maintain practice outside of
sessionsGive parents more freedom in their
selection of solutions to their
problem, avoid suggesting ranking
solutions right away, and add
illustrations and visual codes that are
already familiar in pediatrics
(emoticons)The worksheets will be more
attractive. We will add images,
change the font of the text and titles,
and modify the layout. The “generate
solutions ”worksheet will no longer
suggest ranking parents ’responses
Illustrations and case study Helpful, they relate to examples of
plausible situationsConsider the cultural aspect in the
selection of metaphorsThe professionals will be asked to
adapt the canoe metaphor and case
studies to the cultural background of
the participating parents
3—Practical implementation
Location of the intervention Parents approve of the flexibility in
being able to choose the location of
the intervention (at the hospital or at
home)
Time of the intervention Flexibility in the choice of the time of
the first meeting (approximately 4
weeks after the diagnosis)
Number of sessions Some parents think the number of
sessions is sufficientFor healthcare professionals, some
parents may give up because the
duration (6 sessions) will be
considered too longThe program will be more flexible in
terms of the number of sessions. It
will be possible to complete the 4
individual sessions only, if the parents
prefer
Tasks to complete at home Tasks can be beneficial if they are not
imposedPrescription of tasks to complete at
home may be too demanding for
parentsPrescription of tasks to complete at
home will be more flexible and tasks
will be suggested, not imposed on
parentsOgez et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:20 Page 11 of 14
effectiveness of adapting therapeutic discourse to the pa-
tient’s culture [ 42]. Fourthly, following comments from
participants to decrease the burden related to the inter-
vention, we decided that the place and time for delivery
will be chosen by participants themselves. Hence, meet-
ings can take place in a home or hospital setting. Not-
ably, the program is focused on alleviating overload;
thus, delivery mode should remain coherent with this
concept [ 20]. In addition, this more flexible framework
fits better with the reality of psychological intervention
practice in the day-to-day care of childhood cancer [ 39].
Beyond the results themselves, we wish to highlight
some methodological aspects of this study. The mixed
methodology allowed us to generate a refined evalu-
ation of the program and detail elements of strength
and weaknesses. Using a brief survey at the start helped
highlight the core topics to be addressed in individual
and group interviews, thus allotting as much time as
necessary to what seemed most important to the partic-
ipants in the qualitative data collection. The qualitative
data helped expand these responses by providing de-
tailed justifications about opinions and examples.
Moreover, collecting complementary points of view
from both parents and professionals in separate meet-
ings also helped enrich data by limiting the risk of
self-censorship. Indeed, some comments including crit-
icisms or worries clearly indicated that parents might
have felt intimidated to speak openly about their rela-
tion to the clinic in the presence of the professionals,
while professionals would probably have been more
guarded not to hurt or offend parents if groups had
been mixed. The qualitative dimension was not
intended to confirm the statistical validity of the opin-
ions expressed but rather to reach a level of depth, pre-
cision, and optimal reliability to guide changes and
improvements to be made to the program.
We must acknowledge some limitations of this study.
Parents interviewed in this study were from the province
of Quebec, Canada and spoke French. Although we hadsome diversity among professionals, it was not possible
in parents, for feasibility purposes. It is possible that
additional culturally anchored elements would have been
identified as weaknesses if parents ’background had been
more varied. We used social media networks to invite
parents, which limits the participation to people who
use this technology. We were also faced with the impos-
sibility of assembling all parents in one focus group as
originally planned in our study. However, we conducted
individual interviews that led to a diversity of pertinent
experiences.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study is the second step in defining
a support program designed for parents confronted
with pediatric cancer, TAKING BACK CONTROL TO-
GETHER. Having defined the program concept, we
submitted it to end-users to assess its future relevance
and acceptability, and improve the delivery mode and
its tools/activities. Collecting information from
end-users enabled us to engage in improvements to the
program. The current version is ready to be
pilot-tested. The future pilot will be focused on evaluat-
ing treatment fidelity and overall feasibility in a
pre-post study conducted with parents whose child re-
cently received a pediatric cancer diagnosis. It will also
measure the change associated with the intervention.
