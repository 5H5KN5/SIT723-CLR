Abstract
Background: A key concern for people with chronic pain is experiencing increased pain and/or re-injury.
Consequently, individuals with chronic pain can develop a maladaptive fear of movement that leads to adverse
functional consequences. A primary goal of chronic pain rehabilitation is re-engagement in feared movements
through exposure. This is often challenging since safe movement can be uncomfortable. Virtual environments
provide a promising opportunity to safely and gradually expose Veterans to movements that are avoided in the
real world. The current study will utilize multiple virtual reality (VR) applications (APPs) of varying the intensity levels
ranging from passive distraction from pain to active exposure to feared movement. The primary aims of this pilot
are to examine VR as an adjunctive nonpharmacological intervention to assist with the adoption and
implementation of skills to decrease fear of movement and increase overall functioning among Veterans with
chronic pain. Second, to build a hierarchy of VR APPs to assist in gradual exposure to feared movements.
Methods: This study will be conducted in the Chronic Pain Rehabilitation Program (CPRP) at the James A. Haley
Veterans Hospital, a unique inpatient program within the VA system. Participants will include up to 20 Veterans
who receive a VR intervention as part of their physical therapy. A rating form containing qualitative and quantitative
experiences will be administered following each VR session to assess feasibility and to provide descriptive
information for the proposed hierarchy. Effect sizes will be calculated from intake and discharge measures for the
primary outcome fear of movement and secondary pain and functional outcomes.
Discussion: This study will inform the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial examining the clinical utility of
using VR to reduce fear of movement and increase function among Veterans with chronic pain. VR has the
advantage of being easily implemented both within VA healthcare settings as well as in Veterans ’own residences,
where engagement in ongoing self-management approaches is often most challenging. Presumably, VR that is
matched to patient needs, progresses in intensity, immerses Veterans in the applications, and is perceived positively
by Veterans, will result in positive functional outcomes.

Background
Pain is among the most costly disorders treated in
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) settings [ 1]. Over
five million Veterans were diagnosed with at least one
musculoskeletal disorder from 2001 to 2011, nearly half
of whom reported moderate-to-severe pain [ 2]. The
treatment of pain was established as a VA priority in
1998 [ 3], but in recent years, pain management has re-
ceived more attention due to national concerns regard-
ing opioid overdose, addiction, and high-profile adverse
events [ 4]. Given this burden, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [ 4] and other national organiza-
tions [ 5] have recommended non-pharmacological
approaches as the preferred treatments for chronic non-
cancer pain.
Fear of movement
A key concern for people with chronic pain, defined as
pain persisting longer than 3 months [ 6], is experiencing
increased pain or (re) injury [ 7]. As a result, individuals
often develop kinesiophobia, a fear of movement [ 7].
Kinesiophobia can be helpful in acute pain which lasts
less than 3 months [ 6], but maladaptive in chronic pain,
as it leads to adverse functional consequences [ 7]. A
primary goal of chronic pain rehabilitation is re-
engagement in feared movements through exposure.
However, this is often challenging since safe movement
can be physically and emotionally uncomfortable [ 8].
Virtual reality
Virtual reality (VR) can be defined as “computer-gener-
ated simulations of three-dimensional objects or envi-
ronments with seemingly real, direct, or physical user
interaction ”(pg. 34) [ 9]. Today ’s virtual technologies use
the computer and wearable devices to give the user the
illusion of being immersed or present in a non-physical
world [ 10,11]. VR can serve as an adjunctive method in
evidence-based interventions to assist with the delivery
and adoption of self-management skills [ 11–13]. When
VR that is matched to patient level of functioning pro-
gresses in intensity, immerses people in the applications,
and is perceived positively, it can contribute to improved
fear of movement and disability [ 12,13]. To date, VR re-
search [ 11–13] has prominently focused on two cogni-
tive behavioral therapy [ 8] techniques, distraction from
and exposure to pain.
Virtual reality and pain distraction
Evidence supports the use of VR to attenuate pain with
the majority of evidence to date aimed at treating acute
pain. A rapid evidence assessment of immersive VR for
acute pain management (17 studies, 337 patients) found
strong evidence for immediate and short-term pain re-
duction, as well as moderate evidence for short-termanalgesic effects on physical function [ 11]. Distraction-
focused treatments (e.g., guided imagery, relaxation
training) are the most commonly researched VR-
administered interventions for acute pain relief [ 11,14].
Distraction therapy is based on the assumption that
humans have finite attentional resources [ 8,15]. VR dis-
traction is hypothesized to consume attention leaving
less cognitive capacity for processing pain [ 15] and fear
of movement [ 13]. A recent controlled trial conducted
in an inpatient acute pain care setting demonstrated re-
duced pain scores among patients playing a “medium-in-
tensity ”pain distraction VR application (APP) compared
to a televised high-definition nature video [ 16]. Pilot
work suggests that relaxation using VR may be associ-
ated with reduced pain intensity among people with
chronic pain [ 17].
Virtual reality and exposure therapy for pain
In contrast to pain distraction, exposure therapy focuses
attention on the fearful stimulus and inducing a feeling
of“being there ”[18,19]. To be effective, exposure ther-
apies should be graded, motivating, and related to real-
life functional activities [ 14,20]. A randomized study
found that integrating exposure via guided virtual walk-
ing into physical therapy resulted in a significant de-
crease in fear of movement and pain intensity when
compared to physical therapy without VR [ 21]. A feasi-
bility study found high acceptability ratings of a virtual
dodgeball intervention to influence lumbar flexion for
people with chronic low back pain and pain-related fear
[22]. No participants withdrew from the study and no
adverse events or increased medication use was reported
[22]. This evidence supports using VR as an adjunctive
therapeutic delivery method for reducing fear of move-
ment among people with chronic pain [ 21,22].
Hierarchy from distraction to exposure
It has been argued that distraction from pain-related
thoughts and emotions can promote avoidance of factors
contributing to the development and maintenance of
chronic pain [ 12,13]. This can undermine the effective-
ness of distraction-only VR therapies among chronic
pain populations who have a greater need for rehabilita-
tion than immediate relief [ 12,23]. We have conceptual-
ized a two-dimensional hierarchy for movement and
intensity of stimulation for people with chronic pain.
The hierarchy will range from low-intensity pain distrac-
tion to more “interactive ”graded exposure techniques
within the same VR-assisted intervention (e.g., sitting
passively in a chair during guided meditation to standing
and using body movement to engage in virtual activities
such as painting).Fowler et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:146 Page 2 of 10
Current study
The proposed project is informed by the Fear-Avoidance
Model of Chronic Pain [ 7] and assumes that as people
gradually confront feared activities through VR, mal-
adaptive pain beliefs are challenged and fear responses
are extinguished [ 14,24]. Both distraction [ 22] and
exposure [ 21] could be beneficial for improving fear of
movement among people with chronic pain. Still, studies
typically examine these methods independently despite
the former being inherent during VR utilization [ 14].
This will be the first known study that will investigate
the use of immersive VR across a distraction to exposure
spectrum as an adjunct strategy for chronic pain man-
agement in a sample of US Veterans.
Aims and objective
The objective of this study is to establish feasibility for a
future randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will test
the effectiveness of VR as a treatment adjunct for
chronic pain management and aim to validate the pro-
posed hierarchy. The primary aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Describe the individual Veteran trajectories
and APP intensity ratings on the proposed distraction-
to-exposure hierarchy.
/C15RQ 1.1: How many different trajectory patterns
emerge as Veterans progress across the intensity
levels of the distraction-to-exposure hierarchy?
/C15RQ 1.2: How do Veterans rate the intensity of the
VR APPs?
Aim 2: Estimate the within-subjects effect size and
95% confidence interval (CI) associated with changes in
fear of movement and secondary outcomes to provide
insight into the likely magnitude of effect associated with
the VR intervention.
/C15RQ 2.1: What is the estimated within-subjects effect
size and 95% CI for changes in the primary
outcome, fear of movement, from baseline to post-
test following the VR intervention?
/C15RQ 2.2: What is the estimated within-subjects effect
size and 95% CI in common feared movements from
baseline to post-test following the VR intervention?
/C15RQ 2.3: What are the within-subjects effect sizes
and 95% CIs for changes for the secondary outcomes
of pain intensity, pain interference, pain
catastrophizing, pain-related functioning, and
negative affect from baseline to post-test following
the VR intervention?
/C15RQ 2.4: What proportion of Veterans experience
clinically meaningful change for the following
outcomes: common feared movements, painintensity, pain catastrophizing, pain-related
functioning, and negative affect?
Aim 3: Pilot test this protocol to assess the feasibility
of VR use to plan for a future randomized controlled
trial.
/C15RQ 3.1: How do Veteran users describe their
experiences with VR during this study?
/C15RQ 3.2: What are the identified barriers and
facilitators of VR use?
/C15RQ 3.3: What is the estimated compliance
(percentage of sessions attempted, completed) with
VR?
Methods
Study setting
The CPRP at the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital is a
19-day residential chronic pain treatment program. The
interdisciplinary treatment provided in the CPRP utilizes
a cognitive behavioral treatment approach that targets
the physical and psychological impact of chronic pain.
The CPRP is the sole inpatient chronic pain program
within the VA system, and its attendees are Veterans re-
ferred system-wide.
Participants and recruitment
All Veterans ( N≤20) enrolled in the CPRP over the 3-
week data collection period will be recruited. Interested
individuals will be consented in-person by the research
staff. Given the pragmatic nature of this study, eligibility
is consistent with the CPRP program. Inclusion criteria:
(1) the presence of chronic pain syndrome (ICD-9-CM
code 338.4) and experiencing psychosocial dysfunction
and functional impairments due to chronic pain and (2)
a negative urine drug screen for alcohol, illicit sub-
stances, and prescribed opioid or psychiatric medica-
tions. Exclusion criteria: (1) uncontrolled depressive
symptoms; (2) actively suicidal; (3) uncontrolled
psychotic symptoms; (4) a recent history of violent or
aggressive behavior; (5) high fall risk; and (6) cardiac,
pulmonary, or neurological contraindications [ 25,26].
Each week, four Veterans graduate from the program
and are discharged from the CPRP. Up to four new
Veterans are then admitted into the CPRP. Enrollment
includes up to 12 Veterans at a time. Demographic char-
acteristics from a CPRP cohort study ( N= 705) reported
that Veterans were 50.08 ± 11.03 years old with an aver-
age pain chronicity of 13.02 ± 10.85 years, report baseline
pain near the “severe ”range (7/10) on a numeric rating
scale 6.95 ± 1.65, primarily experience back pain
(56.20%), are prominently male (79.80%), Caucasian
(60.77%), on disability or retired (73.22%), slightly more
likely to be married (51.63%), less likely to be prescribedFowler et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:146 Page 3 of 10
opioids daily (39.46%), and experience “moderate ”relief
from opioid therapy [ 25]. The program attrition rate for
non-compliance during this period was 14.89% ( N=
105). Consistent with the VA mission to reduce high-
dose opioid use, all Veterans must agree to begin an opi-
oid taper upon CPRP admission when applicable.
Design
A type 1 hybrid design will be used to blend clinical ef-
fectiveness and implementation research to accelerate
the proposed VR intervention into practice. Primary and
secondary outcomes (Aim 2) will be assessed using a
within-subjects pretest-posttest design. Qualitative pre-
implementation data will be collected following each VR
session. The VR intervention will be implemented as an
adjunct part of graded exposure physical therapy (PT)
sessions in the CPRP. For each session, participants will
be assigned to use one of two VR head-mounted displays
(HMD: Oculus Rift, Gear VR). VR assignment will be
balanced secondary to equipment availability. Specific-
ally, participants will participate in two sessions of Gear
VR [27] for each session of Oculus Rift [ 28].
Intervention
To build a hierarchy of VR APPs for matching the tech-
nology to patient need, the VR intervention will consist
of 12 commercially-available APPs (six per VR modality)
selected by investigators that could potentially reduce
fear of movement. The APPs are matched based on two
dimensions: movement intensity (low, moderate, high)
and Veteran position (seated, standing). Movement in-
tensity includes the level of movement required to meet
the demands of the APP. Low-intensity APPs will re-
quire minimal movement activities including guided
meditation and visual imagery-based environments.
Moderate intensity APPs include more active demands
including exploring virtual environments and controlling
air or watercraft. High-intensity APPs will require partic-
ipants to use a greater range of bodily motion including
painting on 3D canvases or rhythm-based activities
(similar to the video game “Rock Band ”)[29]. While pre-
vious studies have emphasized the intensity [ 16], it is
important to consider whether the participant uses the
VR technology in a seated vs. a standing position be-
cause this may impact the intensity of the required
movement. The APPs utilized in this study [ 30–40] are
presented in Table 1.
Comparable APPs were chosen for two VR HMDs,
Oculus Rift VR [ 28] and Samsung Oculus Gear VR
HMD ’s[27]. Oculus Rift is a commercially available VR
HMD with two hand-operated controllers which can be
used with commercial computers with appropriate pro-
cessing and graphics capabilities [ 10,28]. The HMD de-
tects head movement and the controllers track handmovements via 3D inertial sensor technology [ 10]. Case
and pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of
Oculus Rift for research and treatment of acute and
chronic pain and movement-based disorders [ 41–44].
The Samsung Oculus Gear VR HMD [ 27] is another
commercially available unit designed for use with the
Samsung Galaxy Series smartphones (i.e., series S6 and
newer). The HMD projects VR images are generated by
the smartphone with sound [ 27]. The Samsung Oculus
Gear VR HMD has also been utilized in previous re-
search for acute pain management among hospitalized
patients [ 16]. Figure 1presents research team members
demonstrating the Oculus Rift and Samsung Oculus
Gear VR (used with written permission).
Procedures
At CPRP admission, licensed clinical psychologists will
inform prospective participants about the study and pro-
vide them with a flyer. The clinical staff will then send a
VA-encrypted e-mail containing the contact information
of any interested Veterans to the study coordinator. A
member of the research team (i.e., licensed physical ther-
apist, licensed occupational therapist, or clinical psych-
ology post-doctoral fellow) will follow up with interested
Veterans in person to further discuss the study and ob-
tain informed consent. Veterans will be explicitly in-
formed that they can leave the study at any time without
penalty and that they can participate in VR as part of
their PT even if they choose not to consent for partici-
pation in the study.
The CPRP provides two daily group sessions of PT,
each session containing up to six Veterans. Within each
PT session, participants will be randomized into groups
of three. One group will receive the VR intervention for
the first 20 min with the other group receiving PT. Dur-
ing VR sessions, one participant will use the Oculus Rift
and two participants will use Samsung Oculus Gear VR.
During the first VR session, the intensity hierarchy will
be explained, and Veterans will begin by using guided
meditation (low intensity). In each session, the VeteransTable 1 APPs for Oculus Rift VR and Samsung Oculus Gear VR

will be asked whether they wish to progress to a higher
intensity VR APP or continue using similar intensity
APPs and their preference to sit or stand during their
VR participation. The Veteran will choose whether to sit
or stand during their VR participation. After the 20-min
VR sessions, the groups will switch treatment modalities
(VR to PT and vice versa). Following each VR session,
Veterans will be administered the daily rating form. Fear
of movement and pain outcomes will be treatment pro-
gress measures administered to all Veterans by CPRPstaff at admission and discharge. These research teams
will retrieve these measures along with demographic in-
formation from the VA electronic medical record. En-
gagement between participants and the research team
during VR sessions will help ensure adherence to the
intervention protocol. A customizable user manual for
Oculus Rift and Samsung Oculus Gear VR was devel-
oped for this study to assist in training the research team
and to use with the study protocol (available upon
request). The study schedule is presented in Table 2.
Ethical compliance
The annual internal audit completed by the research
compliance office at the James A. Haley Veterans Hos-
pital will serve the purpose of examining ethical compli-
ance. Any adverse events will be reported to clinical
staff, the research service at the James A. Haley Veterans
Hospital, and the University of South Florida IRB.
Confidentiality
Several steps will be taken to secure participant confi-
dentiality. First, any contact information from interested
Veterans will be sent from CPRP staff to the research
team via VA-encrypted e-mail. Second, electronic data
files will be saved only on a secured VA server behind
the VA firewall. Third, informed consents will be stored
in locked filing cabinets in the project manager ’s office.
Finally, all raw data will be stored separately in a locked
filing cabinet in the principal investigators ’office.

Primary measures
The daily rating form is available from the authors upon
request. Functional and pain measures were chosen
based on their psychometric properties, relevance to
chronic pain populations, and availability within the
CPRP medical record.
Feasibility of VR
Daily rating form Following each VR session, a daily
rating form will be used to document participants ’VR
experiences. Specifically, the research team will use the
daily rating form to track the APP the Veteran selects
during their VR session, self-reported APP intensity,
whether they participate in a seated or standing position,
and the number of sessions completed. Information on
APP intensity will be used to plot progression across the
distraction-to-exposure hierarchy (Aim 1). Veterans will
also be assessed using validated single-item measures of
“cybersickness ”[45] and their level of “immersion ”in
the VR experience [ 46]. Information collected from the
daily rating form will also be utilized to gain a better un-
derstanding of feasibility including potential barriers and
facilitators of using VR within this complex Veteran
population (Aim 3). For example, chronic pain popula-
tions may require special considerations for using VR
due to factors such susceptibility to cybersickness (e.g.,
dizziness, nausea) and physical levels of (dis) comfort of
HMDs [ 47]. Both factors can provoke greater anxiety/
panic and be addressed by a tailored approach to HMD
selection and content exposure (e.g., lower-intensity
stimuli, appropriate VR session length) [ 47]. Participants
will be given the opportunity to provide such additional
information about their VR experience via their length
of use and four open-ended questions, i.e., likes, dislikes,
symptoms, and additional comments. This data will be
recorded using the daily rating form and be used to
guide any necessary modifications for the main trial (see
the “Discussion ”section).
Fear of movement
Kinesiophobia will be the primary outcome and assessed
with the following measures. The first is the two-item
“fear ”subscale from the Pain Outcomes Questionnaire-
VA (POQ-VA) [ 48], which will be used to examine the
general fear of movement (i.e., fear of re-injury,
avoidance). The second measure of kinesiophobia is the
10-item Fear of Daily Activities Questionnaire (FDAQ)
[49], which will be used to examine common feared
movements.
Pain Outcomes Questionnaire-VA (primary) The
POQ-VA [ 48] a comprehensive multidimensional instru-
ment was developed and validated specifically forVeteran populations. The Intake and Discharge versions
of this questionnaire contain the following: 19 “primary
items ”that measure pain treatment outcomes across six
prominent pain-related domains including a two-item
fear of movement scale. These primary scale items are
measured on 11-point rating scales (0 to 10) with higher
scores indicating better outcomes. Similar to other scales
on this measure, the fear of movement scale has demon-
strated good generalizability and discriminant and con-
current validity [ 48,50]. Internal consistency may be
questionable [ 48] and no minimum clinically important
change (MCIC) standards have been established for this
subscale.
Fear of Daily Activities Questionnaire The FDAQ is a
self-report measure designed to assess feared common
activities for people with chronic pain using the Fear-
Avoidance Model [ 49]. All 10-items are measured using
a 100-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 ( no
fear) to 100 ( maximal fear ). The FDAQ can be averaged
and utilized as a full scale with item content reflecting
upright and seated posture as well as spinal movement.
The full-scale FDAQ has demonstrated good internal
(Cronbach ’sα= .91) and test-retest reliability (ICC =
0.90) as well as strong concurrent validity with disability
(r= 0.70) and moderate concurrent validity with other
pain measures to be used in this study, e.g., Pain Cata-
strophizing Scale ( r= 0.52) and the numeric rating scale
(r= .34) [ 49,51]; sensitivity to change with reductions in
disability ( r= 0.49) and pain catastrophizing ( r= 0.35) at
4-week follow-up following graded-exposure physical
therapy [ 49]. The minimum clinically important change
(MCIC) on the FDAQ is a 12.9 point reduction [ 49].
Secondary outcome measures
Secondary pain and functional outcomes will be exam-
ined to formalize optimal additional measures for VR
use in a future RCT.
Pain Outcomes Questionnaire-VA (secondary)
The additional 17 primary items on the POQ-VA
measure four additional subscales to be examined as sec-
ondary outcomes. These scales include pain intensity,
interference with mobility, interference with ADLs, and
negative affect (e.g., depression, anxiety). These subscale
scores have demonstrated acceptable internal consistency
(Cronbach ’sα=0 . 7 8 –0.90) [ 48]. The POQ-VA will also be
utilized to collect additional descriptive information in-
cluding pain history (e.g., chronicity, locations), disability
and employment status, opioid use, and pain-related med-
ical utilization over the previous 3 months. No MCIC
scores have been published for the POQ-VA subscales
except the pain intensity numeric rating scale (MCIC =
2.1–2.8 points) [ 52]. Daily pain intensity scores will alsoFowler et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:146 Page 6 of 10
be collected from the medical record because this may im-
pact progression in the hierarchy.
Pain Catastrophizing Scale
The 13-item Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) [ 53] will
be used to measure maladaptive and exaggerated nega-
tive beliefs “toward actual or anticipated experiences ”of
pain (p. 602) [ 54]. Items are measured on a 5-point
Likert-type scale anchored by 0 ( not at all ) and 4 ( all
the time ) with higher scores indicating greater levels of
catastrophizing. The PCS has demonstrated utility as
both a full-scale score as well as a three-factor structure
with subscales measuring cognitive “rumination ”on pain
symptoms ( “I keep thinking about how much it hurts ”),
“magnification ”of pain symptoms ( “I become afraid that
the pain will get worse ”), and “helplessness ”(“There is
nothing I can do to reduce the intensity of the pain ”)
[53,55]. The full-scale PCS score has established MCIC
improvements for return to work (38%) and pain reduc-
tion (44%) following rehabilitation [ 56], but not for its
subscales. Hence, the full-scale PCS score will be exam-
ined in the current study. The full PCS has demon-
strated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach ’sα=
0.87 –0.93) [ 53,55], test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.75)
[53], and criterion validity in d ifferentiating between
chronic pain outpatient and community adult
samples [ 55].
Patient-Specific Functional Scale
The Patient-Specific Function Scale (PSFS) [ 57] can be
tailored to the individual ’s health-related functioning.
Participants are asked to self-select three-to-five activ-
ities that cause great difficulty or they can no longer en-
gage in secondary to a specific health condition. They
are then asked to rate the difficulty of these activities on
an 11-point scale anchored by 0 ( unable to perform ) and
10 (able to perform at prior level ). A score will be ob-
tained by averaging activities and using reverse-scoring
for interpretation consistency with other measures;
higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The PSFS has
demonstrated good test-test reliability (ICC = 0.82) and
sensitivity to change among people with chronic neck
pain [ 58] and acute low back pain (ICC = 0.91 –0.97)
[59], convergent validity with disability ( r= 0.55 –.74),
role functioning ( r= 0.44), physical functioning ( r=
0.30), and bodily pain ( r= 0.34) [ 59]. The MCIC for the
PSFS has been established for small (1.3 –2.29 points),
moderate (2.3 –2.69), and large clinical improvements
(> 2.70) [ 60].
Analytic plan
All demographic characteristics, primary and secondary
measures, will be described by the use of means and
standard deviations for continuous variables andpercentages for categorical variables. Multiple steps will
be taken to handle missing data. Missing value patterns
will be examined using Little ’s Missing Completely at
Random Test [ 61]. Missing data will be estimated using
multiple imputations with demographic information and
participant baseline scores on primary and secondary
measures as predictors of missing items [ 62]. Up to 20%
of missing data will be allowed for the proposed study
based on evidence suggesting that standardized bias of
mean changes is acceptable when using multiple
imputation techniques in a small sample ( N= 20) [ 63].
Aim 1
Describe the individual Veteran trajectories and APP in-
tensity ratings across the proposed distraction-to-
exposure hierarchy. Distributions of the Veteran-
selected VR APPs (proposed movement intensity range
of 1 –6) will be calculated and plotted across all sessions
over the course of the study. The frequency of individual
Veteran trajectories will be counted to identify common
patterns for the preferred level of movement. Veteran ’s
average self-reported intensity ratings for individual VR
APPs will be plotted across sessions. Consistencies be-
tween the level of movement required to engage in the
APP and self-reported intensity will be descriptively
examined.
Aim 2
Estimate the within-subjects effect size and 95% CI for
changes in fear of movement to provide insight into the
likely magnitude of effect associated with the VR inter-
vention. For the primary outcome (POQ-VA: fear of
movement) the within-participant effect size calculations
(Mpost –Mpre/SD diff) will be made along with 95% CIs to
provide insight into the effect associated with VR
utilization [ 64]. This step will also be completed for the
FDAQ. Furthermore, the FDAQ mean difference from
baseline and 95% CI will be calculated and compared to
the established MCIC for this measure. The proportion
of Veterans that experience clinically meaningful change
will then be calculated. For secondary pain and func-
tional measures, the effect sizes, mean differences from
baseline with 95% CIs, and the proportion of partici-
pants that experience meaningful change will be exam-
ined. Data from secondary measures will be used to
select optimal instruments for use with VR in a larger
RCT.
Aim 3
Pilot test this protocol to assess the feasibility of VR use
to plan for a future RCT. Veteran experiences using VR
as an adjunct for pain including potential barriers and
facilitators to use will be examined. Feedback and re-
sponses to questions on the daily rating form will beFowler et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:146 Page 7 of 10
transcribed word-by-word and analyzed using the fol-
lowing steps [ 65]. First, the text will be read several
times. Second, exploratory commenting will be per-
formed line-by-line to let the data drive the coding.
Third, line-by-line coding will be chronologically or-
dered into emergent themes. Steps one through three
will be tabled: a MS Word document will be created for
each emergent theme identified in steps one through
three. Super-ordinate themes will be identified by
searching for patterns and connections between the
emerging themes. Compliance to the VR protocol will
also be examined. The proportion of VR sessions
attended (attended sessions/total sessions) will be calcu-
lated. Additionally, the number of VR sessions com-
pleted without early termination (completed sessions/
total session attempts) will be calculated and reported.
This information will help us determine anticipated
adherence for the larger trial.
Discussion
Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using VR in-
terventions as a means of pain distraction for people
with acute [ 11,16,42] and to a lesser extent chronic
pain [ 17]. Similarly, evidence suggests that graded expos-
ure to feared movements via VR interventions can im-
prove function among people with chronic pain [ 21,22].
However, there is a lack of sufficient evidence from stud-
ies examining multiple VR APPS or varying simulation
intensity levels, both of which have been identified as
important directions for future VR research [ 16]. More-
over, no studies have examined distraction and exposure
methods as part of a two-dimensional VR hierarchy. The
proposed research addresses these gaps in the literature
by utilizing multiple VR APPs requiring varying levels of
movement that range from low-intensity pain distraction
to a more active exposure to movement.
This study will inform the feasibility of a larger RCT
examining the clinical utility of using VR to reduce fear
of movement, pain, and increase function among Vet-
erans with chronic pain. This will be accomplished in
multiple ways. First, effect size estimates for improve-
ment in fear of movement will be used to power a larger
RCT. Second, effect size and clinically meaningful
change on secondary outcomes will help in the selection
of optimal scales for use with VR in the larger clinical
trial [ 66]. Third, descriptive information collected on
Veteran trajectories for the proposed hierarchy (i.e., APP
selection, self-reported APP intensity) will assist in any
necessary modifications so that Veterans are not over-
or underexposed. Fourth, data collected using the daily
rating form will provide useful information regarding
Veterans with chronic pain using this technology. This
will include whether 20 min is an appropriate length for
VR exposure, experienced adverse events (e.g.,cybersickness, falls), and facilitators (e.g., immersion,
HMD preferences) or barriers (e.g., physical, psycho-
logical discomfort) to VR use [ 47,66]. Additional quali-
tative information will help with the identification of any
additional unforeseen factors.
Examining the feasibility of this protocol will also be
beneficial for Veterans, clinicians, and policymakers. Per
the 2016 National Pain Strategy [ 67], the federal govern-
ment ’s first coordinated plan strives to reduce the bur-
den of chronic pain in the USA. Variations in clinical
practice and inadequate tailoring of pain therapies, as
well as a reliance on relatively ineffective high-risk treat-
ments, have contributed to the poor quality of care for
people with pain [ 67]. If the aims of this research are
achieved, VR will be used in combination with estab-
lished pain management strategies to decrease pain and
opioid use. VR has the advantage of being easily imple-
mented both within VA healthcare settings as well as in
Veterans ’own residences, where engagement in ongoing
self-management approaches is often most challenging.
VR therapies are projected to have a $3.9 billion mar-
ket size by 2023 [ 68], yet despite this tremendous public
health burden, published research to date has not ex-
tended beyond pilot trials and case studies. Given the
lack of large-scale RCTs examining the clinical effective-
ness of VR, findings from the proposed study will
present a key step to inform a larger RCT to validate our
proposed hierarchy and compare it to an active control
group (i.e., VR APPs with no known therapeutic value).
This level of RCT evidence represents a necessary next
step in the evolution of clinical VR research.
