Abstract 
Background: Dance is a mind-body activity of purposeful rhythmic movement to music. There is growing interest in 
using dance as a form of cognitive and physical rehabilitation. This manuscript describes the development of GERAS 
DANcing for Cognition and Exercise (DANCE) and evaluates its feasibility in older adults with cognitive and mobility 
impairments.
Methods: The progressive dance curricula were delivered for 15 weeks (1-h class; twice weekly). Participants were 
eligible if they were community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ with early cognitive or mobility impairment able to 
follow three-step commands and move independently. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment/retention, adher -
ence, participant satisfaction, safety, and adverse events.
Results: Twenty-five older adults (mean (standard deviation [SD]) age = 77.55 (6.10) years, range 68–90 years) with 
early cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (SD) = 21.77 (4.05)) and mobility (92% were pre-frail/frail as indi-
cated on the Fried Frailty Phenotype) impairments were recruited from a geriatric out-patient clinic or within the com-
munity. A total of 20/25 (80%) participants completed the study. Average class attendance was 72%, and self-reported 
homework adherence “most-days / every day” was 89%. A stepwise progression in the dance curricula was observed 
with increases in motor complexity and balance demands, and 95% of participants rated the program as a “just-right” 
challenge. Ninety percent of participants rated GERAS DANCE as excellent, and 100% would recommend the program 
to a friend or family member. Over 50% of participants connected outside of class time for a self-initiated coffee club. 
Adverse events of falls and fractures were reported for 2 participants, which occurred at home unrelated to the dance 
intervention during the study period. Pre-determined thresholds for feasibility were met for all outcomes.
Discussion: GERAS DANCE is a feasible and enjoyable program for older adults with early cognitive or mobility 
impairments. GERAS DANCE curriculum grading (duration; sequence; instructions) and motor complexity increases 
in agility, balance, and coordination appear appropriately tailored for this population. Future work will explore the 
feasibility of GERAS DANCE in new settings (i.e., virtually online, community centers, or retirement homes) and the 
mind-body-social benefits of dance.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibil -
ity? GERAS DANCE is a new program designed with 
rehabilitation and geriatric medicine expertise for 
older adults with early cognitive or mobility impair -
ments. Prior to completing this study, the feasibility 
and resources required to implement the GERAS 
DANCE program and the recruitment were uncer -
tain.
• What are the key feasibility findings? Pre-deter -
mined thresholds for feasibility were met for all out -
comes. GERAS DANCE curriculum grading (dura -
tion; sequence; instructions) and motor complexity 
increases in agility, balance, and coordination appear 
appropriately tailored for this population.
• What are the implications of the feasibility find -
ings for the design of the main study? This study 
provides evidence that GERAS DANCE is a feasible 
and enjoyable program for older adults with early 
cognitive or mobility impairments. The next steps 
include testing the efficacy of GERAS DANCE in an 
RCT.
Background
Both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (16–20%) [1, 2] 
and frailty (10–15%) [3] are highly prevalent in commu -
nity-dwelling older adults over the age of 60 and par -
ticularly for those over 85 years of age [4]. Cognitive and 
mobility impairments in older adults are associated with 
increased risk of disability, loss of independence [5], and 
impact on quality of life [6]. These impairments often co-
exist, and their temporal relationship appears to be bi-
directional [7]. Guidelines recommend that older adults 
with frailty exercise regularly as part of overall medi -
cal management [1, 3]. As outlined in the World Health 
Organization – Healthy Aging report [8], functional abil -
ity is the interaction between intrinsic capacity, environ -
ment, and task. Adherence and enjoyment increase when 
exercise is tailored to match functional abilities and deliv -
ered at an appropriate challenge and intensity level [9]. 
Given the demographic changes to world populations, 
there is an urgent need for action across multiple sectors 
for high-quality programs for older adults of all func -
tional abilities.
Dance is a mind-body activity of purposeful rhythmic 
movement to music. Dance has been used as rehabilita -
tion for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) [10] and 
more recently for those with multiple sclerosis or stroke 
[11]. Dance for PD was designed to build upon strengths 
and anticipate perceptual-motor functional limitations of those with neurological conditions, creating a fun and 
safe environment to celebrate the artistry and movement 
[12]. Dance may also improve cognitive function [13], 
functional mobility and independence [14], muscular 
strength and endurance [15], and overall quality of life 
[16] in older adults. Furthermore, dance may be superior 
to traditional exercise programs given that it is an inher -
ently complex sensorimotor activity that combines both 
physical and cognitive training as a single entity [17, 18] 
and added benefits of music [19]. Building upon these 
therapeutic benefits with rehabilitation and geriatric 
medicine expertise, we designed a program to bring the 
motivational enjoyment of dance aligned with dance for 
PD to community-dwelling older adults with early cogni -
tive or mobility impairments. This manuscript describes 
the development of GERAS DANcing for Cognition 
and Exercise (DANCE) and evaluates its feasibility in 
older adults (aged 60+) with early cognitive or mobility 
impairments. Specifically, our objective was to determine 
the feasibility and resources required to implementing 
the GERAS DANCE and recruitment of older adults with 
early cognitive or mobility impairment using the 2010 
Thabane et al. [20] and 2019 newly updated [21] guide -
lines and CONSORT checklist (Additional file 1).
Methods
Study design
We utilized a prospective cohort single-arm study, pre-
post design, with a 15-week intervention phase.
Participants and setting
Participants were recruited from a regional specialized 
geriatric clinic, community groups, and recreational 
centers, the Alzheimer’s Society utilizing flyers and social 
media. Referral sources were classified as clinical or com -
munity-based referrals. Inclusion criteria were (i) 60+ 
years of age and (ii) presence of early cognitive (Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment [MOCA] total score = 18–25) [22] 
or mobility impairments (e.g., difficulty to climb the stairs 
or walk around the block), (iii) ability to follow three-step 
commands, and (iv) ability to move independently with 
or without an assistive device. Exclusion criteria included 
(i) palliative/end-of-life care, (ii) unstable angina/heart 
failure, and (iii) travel plans that would result in miss -
ing more than 20% of the dance 15-week program. A 
research coordinator obtained informed consent from 
all participants in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and was approved by the Hamilton Integrated 
Research Ethics Board (HIREB #2557).
Intervention
GERAS DANCE was designed with rehabilitation and 
geriatric medicine expertise as a 15-week mind-body

program for older adults (aged 60+ ) with early cogni -
tive or mobility impairments to make dance accessi -
ble for older adults with functional limitations (Fig.  1). 
GERAS DANCE was developed with an activity analysis 
[23], a systematic evaluation in the field of occupational 
therapy, to tailor the curriculum with appropriately 
matched grading (duration; sequence; instructions) 
and motor complexity increases in agility, balance, and 
coordination demands. It is a progressive, evidence-
based curriculum with gradual increases in cognitive 
load and based on motor learning principles with a 
particular focus on the Agility, Balance, and Coordi -
nation  (ABCs) of movement  [24]. The ABCs of move -
ment is essential to quickly and efficiently change the 
body position with balance and coordination [24, 25]. 
Dances were taught with a graded approach to learning 
each step (watch instructor; try each dance step indi -
vidually; combine dance steps in a sequence) and find 
the beat (no music; instrumental music; lyrical music). 
The structured dance curriculum included both seated 
and standing dances (with and without holding onto the 
back of the chair), gradually increasing the time spent 
in standing with increased endurance. This graded 
approach to teaching new dance steps maximized the 
likelihood of success by emphasizing having fun while 
learning something new (rather than the perfection of 
movement). Repetition was used to build confidence in 
movement patterns, and verbal cues were used to help 
execute dances.
GERAS DANCE was delivered as a new program at 
the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Ham -
ilton Burlington Brantford as a part of the LiveWell 
series, which includes tailored rehabilitation pro -
grams for people with cancer [26] or heart disease [27]. 
GERAS DANCE was taught by a dance instructor who 
adhered to a standardized curriculum documented in 
a manual. GERAS DANCE involved 15 weeks of in-
person classes 2×  weekly (1 h each) and homework 
(10 min daily). Each in-person class followed the same 
sequence of activities (introduction/socialization [10 
min]; warm-up [5 min]; structured dance curriculum 
[30 min]; cool-down [5 min]; review of weekly home -
work [10 min]). The curriculum schedule included 
five foundations and seven routines. GERAS DANCE 
foundations emphasized learning the ABCs of move -
ment and increasing participants’ confidence to move 
their bodies forward and backward and side-to-side 
with improved speed and rhythmicity. GERAS DANCE 
routines combined the foundational skills into full cho -
reographed dances to music from the 1950s and 1960s 
(e.g., rock and roll, jazz, salsa, cha cha cha, rhythm soul, 
swing, and disco). The last 2 weeks of the curriculum 
was used to repeat the favorite class dances. Homework sheets for non-class days (target 10 min daily) outlined 
simple instructions and pictures to reinforce/practice 
movements learned and achieve 180 min per week, 
to reduce falls in older adults (Fig.  2) [28]. Instructor 
and end-user feedback was utilized to adapt GERAS 
DANCE programming to match the functional abilities 
of the cohort. A Template for Intervention Descrip -
tion and Replication (TIDieR) checklist is available in 
Additional file  2 and preview at www. geras  centre. ca/  
geras- dance.
Training, equipment, and facilities
The instructor and volunteers received training about 
working with older adults with early cognitive or mobil -
ity impairments including safety and communication 
strategies. Before each GERAS DANCE class, volunteers 
ensured that the studio was clear of tripping hazards 
(e.g., gym mats) and that sturdy chairs without armrests 
were set up in a semi-circle formation. A sound system 
with adjustable volume and a headset microphone was 
required for the instructor adjusted for older adults with 
hearing impairment. Using Whitehead et  al. [29] and 
Thabane et al. [20] feasibility guidelines, our sample size 
was pragmatic and based on class enrollment capac -
ity (25 participants maximum per class) aligned with 
infrastructure and safety guidelines at the YMCA. This 
sample was adequate to determine the feasibility and 
resources required to implement the GERAS DANCE 
program and the recruitment process in planning for a 
larger trial.
Participant demographics
Demographic information was collected at baseline, 
including age, sex, education level, living arrangement, 
and fall history in the past year. Cognition was evalu -
ated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 
[30]. Total MOCA scores range from 0 to 30, and 18–25 
points adjusted for educational level are suggestive of 
mild cognitive impairment [22, 30]. The Fried Frailty 
Phenotype evaluated frailty status based on uninten -
tional weight loss (greater than 10 lbs in the past year), 
low endurance and energy (self-reported exhaustion), 
weakness (low grip strength), slow walking speed, and 
physical activity (self-reported activity level). An overall 
score of 0 means that the individual is not frail; a score 
of 1 or 2 indicates that the individual is pre-frail; a score 
of 3–5 indicates frailty. Physical function was evaluated 
with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 
and a score of < 9 points is indicative of poor physical 
performance [31]. Cognitive, frailty, and physical func -
tion were assessed by a research assistant not involved 
in the study intervention at the GERAS Centre for 
Aging Research.

Feasibility outcomes
Recruitment and retention
The enrollment-to-screening ratio was calculated as the 
total number enrolled as a proportion of the number of 
individuals identified to meet the inclusion criteria. The 
recruitment period was calculated as the time between 
recruitment start and completion. The eligibility crite -
ria will be considered sufficient if the recruitment rate 
is > 10%. The retention rate was calculated as the num -
ber of individuals who remained in the study out of the 
total number of participants recruited at the baseline 
assessment. The retention rate will be considered suf -
ficient > 75% based on recommendations in Thabane 
et al. [20].
Intervention adherence, safety, and adverse events
Adherence to the GERAS DANCE classes was recorded 
by the instructor using an attendance log and calculated 
as the percentage of classes attended (n/30). Adherence 
to the homework was recorded using a self-reported 
questionnaire. Exercise adherence in older adults in the 
literature ranged from 65 to 86%, with lower adherence 
rates observed in those with lower cognitive and physical health [32]. Therefore, in this study, adherence greater 
than 65% of the GERAS DANCE classes and homework 
will be considered sufficient due to the increased number 
of barriers to exercise adherence in our cohort (e.g., poor 
cognitive/physical health, fatigue, low self-efficacy, lack 
of transportation, reliance on a care partner) [33, 34]. 
An instructor log was used to record any modifications 
required to match functional abilities. Adverse events 
(e.g., falls, fatigue, etc.) were self-reported and recorded 
by the dance instructor.
Participant satisfaction
At the last GERAS DANCE class, participants were asked 
to complete a feedback questionnaire designed to assess 
the elements of the following item of GERAS DANCE: 
(1) overall program rating: a 5-point Likert scale from 
terrible, poor, fair, good, or excellent; (2) elements of the 
program enjoyed (yes/no); (3) perceived level of chal -
lenge: indicating if the level of the classes was too easy, 
just right, or too hard; (4) program recommendation: 
would recommend GERAS DANCE to a friend or fam -
ily member (yes, no, maybe); (5) reason for recommenda -
tion (fitness; social; learn something new, fun, other); and 
Fig. 2 Sample GERAS DANCE homework

(6) if the program led to social connections outside the 
class (yes/no).
Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the par -
ticipant characteristics and feedback including means, 
standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals, and 
ranges. All descriptive statistics were calculated using 
SPSS v25.
Results
Participant demographics
Of the participants who completed the study (n = 20), 
70% were female and had a mean age of 77.55 years 
(SD = 6.10, range 68–89; Table  1). Falls were common, 
with 10/20 (50%) of participants indicated that they had 
experienced a fall in the past year, and 5/20 (25%) had 
experienced two or more falls in the past year. Assess -
ments indicated 70% had evidence of cognitive impair -
ment (MOCA < 26), and 50% had mobility limitations 
(SPPB < 9). Four of the 20 participants who completed the 
study were two married couples. Five participants did not 
complete the study; the reasons for withdrawals were fall 
and fracture (n = 2; fell down the stairs due to stroke and 
passed away a month later, and by tripping over a slipper 
at home), not interested in dance (n = 1), lack of trans -
portation (n = 1), and unknown reason (n = 1).
Recruitment and retention
Figure  3 outlines enrollment and retention. Refer -
ral sources were 48% (12/25) clinical and 52% (13/25) 
community-based referrals. For the clinical referrals, 66 
geriatric out-patients were referred and met the inclu -
sion criteria and of those, 12 (18.2%) were enrolled in the study. The enrollment-to-screening ratio was calculated 
as 2:11. For community-based self-referrals, of the 20 
phone calls received, 13 (65%) were enrolled in the study. 
The recruitment period occurred over 3 months, and the 
participant retention rate was 80%.
Intervention adherence, safety, and adverse events
The average class attendance of the study cohort was 
72%, and self-reported homework adherence “most-
days / every day” was 89%. A stepwise progression in the 
dance curricula was observed with increases in motor 
complexity and balance demands (1 class to learn each 
foundation and 2+ classes to learn the routines). Instruc -
tor notes indicated the music from the 1950s and 1960s 
was enjoyed by the attendees. All participants were able 
to complete seated and standing dances. However, some 
participants who felt tired used the option to remain 
seated during some of the standing dance segments. 
The default dance step was marching in the spot to the 
beat if participants needed to rest or felt the steps were 
too complicated. Instructor notes indicated for ease of 
scheduling, 12 weeks was preferred over 15-week classes. 
One caregiver initially attended with their husband to 
ensure they were comfortable participating in the first 
three classes. One fall happened during the dance class 
due to an untied shoelace, but no injuries were sustained. 
Participants did not engage in other new interventions 
beyond GERAS DANCE during the study period.
Participant satisfaction

(1–2 pm), and class length (1 h). Only 70% of participants 
enjoyed dancing while sitting in a chair. Ninety-five per -
cent of participants rated the perceived level of challenge 
as “just right, ” and 100% would recommend the program 
to a friend or family member. Reasons for giving a rec -
ommendation included exercise (89%), social (74%), 
learning something new (68%), and fun (68%). Other 
written responses for recommendation were the quality 
of the instructor, interacting with people, watching oth -
ers on how they do it, encouraging me, and laughing with 
friends. Over 50% of participants connected outside of 
class time for a self-initiated coffee club and were indi -
viduals who did not previously know each other before 
the GERAS DANCE class.
Discussion
This manuscript provides evidence that GERAS DANCE 
is a feasible and enjoyable program for older adults with 
cognitive and mobility impairments (aged 68–90 years) 
with high participant adherence and satisfaction. GERAS 
DANCE curriculum grading (duration; sequence; 
instructions) and motor complexity increases in agility, 
balance, and coordination appear appropriately tailored 
for this population. The program requires a large space, 
sturdy chairs, and a sound system with a microphone.Given the importance of a clinical trial recruitment 
phase, it is critical to understand the feasibility, time -
lines, and best strategies to enroll participants [21]. The 
study recruitment period occurred over 3 months to 
register 25 older adults with early cognitive or mobility 
limitations. For future trials, a stronger focus on com -
munity-based recruitment may help to reduce research 
staff time and improve the recruitment rate. Clinical 
referrals from family physicians may be more appropri -
ate for the prevention and rehabilitation of cognitive 
impairment and frailty. The retention rate of partici -
pants was 80%, which is aligned with a recent systematic 
review on exercise adherence in older adults ranging 
from 65 to 86% [32] .
GERAS DANCE programming aligns with recent evi -
dence suggesting dance programs be organized to run 
twice per week, 1 to 2 h in length, for 3 months in dura -
tion to optimize social, physical, and cognitive benefits 
in neurological populations [11, 35]. GERAS DANCE 
involves multicomponent exercise with both in-studio 
and at-home components to achieve the recommended 
180 min per week to reduce falls in older adults [28]. In 
the in-studio classes, each dance included seated and 
standing components. Only 70% of participants enjoyed 
the seated dances, whereas 100% enjoyed the standing 
dances. However, as Gregor et  al. [29] stated, we agree 
Fig. 3 Participant flow
Page 8 of 10 Hewston et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2022) 8:9 
that an initial sense of physical safety while seated may 
have increased confidence to test intrapersonal bounda -
ries (fear of falling) to explore new movement patterns 
while standing confidently. GERAS DANCE uses a 
graded approach to teaching further dance steps and an 
emphasis on having fun while learning something new 
which may have increased overall enjoyment and confi -
dence by the time the standing dances were performed 
[36]. Instructors provided the option to remain seated 
while dancing when fatigued, check for tripping hazards, 
and remind participants to ensure their shoelaces were 
tied before standing up. The GERAS DANCE homework 
component was well-received, with 89% of participants 
completing the homework most days or every day to 
reinforce/practice movements learned. Participants were 
able to participate in the classes without the support of a 
caregiver. One caregiver initially attended with their hus -
band to ensure they were comfortable participating in the classes; however, after three classes, the caregiver started 
to use this as respite time to go to the library.
Ninety-five percent of participants rated GERAS 
DANCE as a just-right challenge, and 100% would rec -
ommend the program to a friend or family member. 
Compared to the Baycrest Canada National School of 
Ballet Sharing Dance Seniors program [37], where par -
ticipants co-construct and collaboratively animated the 
narrative of the dances, GERAS DANCE has a progres -
sive and structured curriculum aligned with dance move -
ment therapy. Recommendations for GERAS DANCE 
extended beyond the exercise component itself (e.g., 
social, learning something new, laughing with friends). 
The instructor notes indicated that the attendees enjoyed 
music from the 1950s and 1960s, which aligns with the 
participant’s musical “reminiscence bumps, ” in which 
music is associated with events in late adolescence and 
early adulthood [38]. The power of dance in fostering Table 2 Participant feedback [N = 20]

new social connections and a sense of community was 
further demonstrated as 50% of participants connected 
for a self-initiated coffee club during and beyond the 
study duration. It is recommended to teach the holistic 
mind-body-social benefits of dance when training new 
instructors to understand the program benefits beyond 
the exercise itself. Lastly, GERAS DANCE duration was 
recommended to be reduced from 15 weeks as imple -
mented in this study to 12 weeks to better align with 
the YMCA programming schedule with other programs 
which are 12 weeks in length.
Limitations
The GERAS DANCE program has the potential to be 
implemented as community-based rehabilitation. This 
research study was supported by grant funding, which 
allowed participants to attend without any financial cost. 
If participants did not receive free memberships, the 
enrollment could have been lower than reported here. It 
is possible that dancing may not be an appealing exercise 
to men as a higher percentage of females were involved in 
the study. Future work should include a cost analysis and 
potential funding mechanisms to provide the dance pro -
gram as a community-based program as a part of overall 
rehabilitation.
Conclusion
GERAS DANCE is a promising therapeutic intervention 
and enjoyable for older adults with cognitive and mobil -
ity impairments. Future work should explore the feasi -
bility of GERAS DANCE in new settings—i.e., virtually 
online, community centers, or retirement homes. GERAS 
DANCE efficacy will be studied in a randomized con -
trolled trial to examine the mind-body-social benefits of 
dance.
