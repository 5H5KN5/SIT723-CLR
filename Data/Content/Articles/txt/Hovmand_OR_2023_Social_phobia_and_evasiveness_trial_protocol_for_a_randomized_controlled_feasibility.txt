Abstract 
Background Evasive personality disorder (AvPD) and social phobia (SP) have substantial costs for patients and their 
families and great economic costs to the society. While psychotherapy can be an efficacious treatment, many patients 
drop out during treatment. Increased knowledge on how to decrease dropout from psychotherapy is warranted, 
including how to increase a patient’s readiness for psychotherapy.
Methods We describe a randomized controlled feasibility and superiority trial of 42 individuals with a clinical 
diagnosis of either SP or AvPD, who are to initiate psychotherapeutic treatment in Danish outpatient mental health 
services. They will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either assessment-as-usual and receive no further assessment or to 
a Modified Collaborative Assessment (MCA) provided as a pre-treatment intervention before psychotherapy initiation. 
MCA will include a battery of psychological tests designed to thoroughly assess the patients’ psychopathology. The 
tests are administered in collaboration with the patient, including detailed oral and written feedback. We hypothesize 
that the intervention is feasible regarding patient’s acceptance and adherence. We further hypothesize that patients 
randomized to MCA will reach higher levels of readiness for psychotherapy as assessed with the University of Rhode 
Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA).
Discussion This protocol assesses the feasibility, efficacy, acceptability, and safety of an intervention aimed at 
changing the readiness for participation in psychotherapy of patients with SP and AvPD. Results from this feasibility 
study could guide the development of future large-scale trials of MCA and procedures for MCA treatment fidelity 
assessment.

Background
Introduction and rationale
Anxiety disorders represent an important public health 
concern in the Western world [1, 2]. Estimates from a 
large European epidemiological survey suggest that 14% 
of the European population will meet the criteria for an 
anxiety disorder within their lifetime [3]. These disorders 
are often associated with a chronic, debilitating course 
for the affected individual as well as high socio-economic 
costs [4–6]. Anxiety disorders are among the leading 
causes of the global disease burden and the annual costs 
in Europe alone reached 74 billion Euros in 2010 [7, 8]. 
Continuous efforts to improve treatment programs for 
anxiety pathology are imperative.
Social phobia (SP) is the most common among the anx -
iety disorders. The fear of being observed or negatively 
evaluated by other people is a prominent characteris -
tic of individuals with social phobia. This fear leads the 
individual to avoid performance or social situations (e.g., 
speaking or eating in front of others, making acquaint -
ances, and meeting authorities), or enter such situations 
with substantial discomfort [9]. This evasiveness severely 
impacts the social functioning and quality of life of 
affected individuals [10, 11].
Similarly, avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is 
characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, 
feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to nega -
tive evaluation, which result in marked evasiveness and 
avoidance of social interactions. AvPD patients perceive 
themselves as unwanted and isolated from others [9]. The 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
fifth edition (DSM-5) [12], recognizes a considerable 
overlap between AvPD and SP . Although the relation -
ship between the disorders is a matter of debate [13], 
the dominant conceptualization is that the two disorders 
represent a spectrum, differing from each other only in 
severity (the severity continuum hypothesis [14]). In the 
upcoming revision of the International Classification of 
Diseases, tenth edition (ICD-10), AvPD will be removed 
as an independent diagnosis [15], which further supports 
the severity continuum hypothesis. Similar to the anxiety 
disorders, AvPD is associated with profound impairment 
in daily life for the affected individual, as well as high 
socio-economic costs [16]. Hence, the present study pro -
tocol relevantly focuses on SP and social evasiveness.
Danish outpatient mental health services provide 
time-restricted, standardized, interdisciplinary treat -
ment programs for social phobia and AvPD. Following 
national clinical practice guidelines, the treatment pro -
grams offer evidence-based cognitive-behavioral ther -
apy for social phobia and mentalization-based therapy 
for AvPD.The content and format in the standardized treatment 
programs for moderate-severe SP and AvPD are regu -
lated in accordance with the Danish Health Authority 
guidelines. The treatment program for SP consists of 
diagnostic assessment (1–3 consultations), medical con -
sultations (1–2 consultation), and group therapy with 
two therapists (14 sessions (120 min)), relatives’ support 
(1 session), and network consultation (1 session) [17]. 
Correspondingly, the standardized outpatient treatment 
program for AvPD includes up to 78 h of clinician time 
consisting of clinical assessment (2 h), medical consulta -
tions (1–2 consultations), group therapy with two thera -
pists (30 sessions (120  min)), and network consultation 
(1–2 sessions) [18].
However, despite a solid evidence base for the efficacy 
of cognitive-behavioral therapy for social phobia, recent 
meta-analytic data suggest that only 45% of patients suf -
fering from social phobia remit from their principal diag -
nosis after treatment and patients with social phobia 
have a worse outcome than patients with other anxiety 
disorders [19]. The evidence-based psychological treat -
ment for avoidant personality is limited in terms of num -
ber and quality of studies and the remission rates vary 
substantially from 40 to 80% [20].
Data from a recently finalized multicenter rand -
omized controlled trial [21] investigating the relative 
efficacy of group diagnosis-specific versus transdiagnos -
tic cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders or 
depression supports the meta-analytic findings on social 
phobia. In this trial, 291 patients with anxiety disorders 
or depression received standardized treatment programs 
from three Danish mental health services, and the results 
suggested that only half of the patients no longer met 
diagnostic criteria for their principal diagnosis by the end 
of treatment [22]. No data exists on the efficacy of the 
standardized programs for AvPD.
Modified collaborative assessment
Psychiatric assessment usually aims to establish a diagno -
sis and plan the treatment, but it is not considered part 
of the treatment proper. We wish to alter this perspective 
by the introduction and exploration of a modification of 
Collaborative Assessment that we have chosen to name 
Modified Collaborative Assessment (MCA).
MCA takes off from Collaborative Assessment and 
Therapeutic Assessment (C/TA) [23–25]. These terms are 
used to describe a family of semi-structured, brief thera -
peutic interventions, in which a therapist administers 
a large battery of standardized diagnostic and psycho -
logical tests in collaboration with a patient and delivers 
feedback in a manner that is useful and enriching—and 
therefore therapeutic—for the patient.
Page 3 of 11
 Hovmand et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:102 
 
C/TA has been explored in several controlled tri -
als with adults and has been shown to increase a range 
of process variables related to therapy outcomes. This 
includes self-esteem [26–29], compliance with treatment 
recommendations [30], therapeutic alliance with subse -
quent therapist [31, 32], and satisfaction with treatment 
[33], as well as decreased anxiety symptoms [34, 35] and 
levels of self-criticism [34]. In addition, Poston and Han -
son [36] published a meta-analysis on 17 published C/TA 
studies, which found favorable effects of this interven -
tion in terms of overall effectiveness when compared to 
assessment as usual.
We wish to apply a modification of C/TA, where the 
intervention is shorter, is slightly more structured, and 
requires less psychiatric expertise (i.e., it can be car -
ried out by trainee doctors and psychologists), which we 
therefore expect to be more feasible in the trial as well as 
in later implementation.
Like C/TA, MCA will include the administration of 
standardized diagnostic instruments, but in contrast to 
C/TA, we will only include a smaller selection of tests in 
order to secure feasibility. The battery of tests will be spe -
cifically designed to gather information on psychopathol -
ogy which a brief clinical interview might not detect, such 
as symptoms of previously undetected developmental dis -
orders or incipient psychosis. We have compiled a battery 
of tests with this focus because we find it most suitable 
for application in the Mental Health Service. The present 
study is further designed to establish diagnosis adhering 
to the current diagnostic systems (ICD-10 and DSM-5), 
but we expect it would also be applicable if the Mental 
Health Service introduced the dimensional [37, 38] model 
of psychopathology, since the current MCA also includes 
a thorough personality assessment according to the 
DSM-5 alternative model of personality pathology.
MCA emphasizes respect for the patients as “experts 
on themselves. ” The assessor will, in collaboration with 
the patient, formulate a list of therapeutic questions 
which the patient would like to “ask the psychologi -
cal tests. ” This will help guide the patient and assessor’s 
collaborative quest to learn more about the patient’s 
problems and personal resources. The results of the 
assessment and the answers to the therapeutic questions 
will be communicated, respectfully, to the patient both 
orally and in writing. It will further be communicated to 
the patient’s future therapist in writing. In this manner, it 
should be possible to formulate personally relevant prob -
lems for later psychotherapy. The MCA assessor recog -
nizes that diagnostic assessment is an interpersonal event 
and that the relationship between assessor and patient is 
paramount both in relation to the validity of the result 
and the patient’s further treatment [25].In short, MCA is a brief, individualized, and per -
son-centered assessment of psychopathology, where 
assessment, psychotherapy, and psychoeducation are 
integrated into a novel intervention, all carried out in col -
laboration with the patient.
Readiness for psychotherapy
The fundamental role of patients’ readiness for psy -
chotherapy change (or client motivation) in the out -
come of therapy is widely recognized [39]. The overall 
concept refers to the intentional aspect of change, the 
internal drive preceding behavioral change before the 
initiation of therapy, and the ongoing engagement 
throughout therapy [40]. Theoretically, the concept 
is most profoundly described as a core component 
in the “stage of change” dimension of the so-called 
Transtheoretical Model of behavioral change set for -
ward by Prochaska and DiClemente [41]. In the “stage 
of change” dimension, patients are assumed to vary 
in their overall readiness to change, being on differ -
ent levels ranging from “pre-contemplation” to being 
ambivalent about change (“contemplation”), having 
intentions to change (“preparation”), starting changes 
(“action”), and consolidating changes (“maintenance”).
Studies have consistently found patients’ readi -
ness to change to be an important factor in predicting 
and moderating their psychotherapy outcomes [42]. 
Regarding anxiety disorders, research indicates that 
patients’ readiness to change reduces symptoms and 
improves other process variables, such as working alli -
ance and adherence to treatment [43]. However, data 
suggests that up to 80% of patients are not ready for 
change (to pursue treatment goals) when they enter 
treatment and possess ambivalence about therapy [44].
We expect that MCA will increase patients’ readi -
ness for psychotherapy, as assessed by the University 
of Rhode Island’s Change Assessment Scale (URICA) 
(contemplation subscale) and the Readiness for Psycho -
therapy Index (RPI), and will increase engagement in 
psychotherapy as measured by attendance. We expect 
that more than one mechanism of action is at play: (a) 
the patient will develop a relationship with the MCA 
accessor and the outpatient clinic during the course 
of MCA, which will carry over to the therapeutic rela -
tionship with the psychotherapist; (b) due to the struc -
tural MCA format, the patient will be confident that 
her problems are seen and understood; (c) the patient 
will understand herself, her problems, and personal 
strengths and will be able to work more effectively 
on these in therapy; and (d) the therapists will have a 
greater knowledge of the patient’s problems based on 
the summaries from the MCA.

Objectives
The study objectives are to (1) explore the feasibility of 
MCA as an intervention through rates of recruitment 
of screened patients, patience’s adherence to MCA or 
Assessment As Usual (AAU), patient satisfaction ratings, 
and patient and therapist/clinician evaluations; (2) com -
pare the effect of MCA versus AAU on levels of readiness 
for psychotherapy in patients referred to group therapy 
for social phobia or AvPD at end-of-intervention (T1) 
(main outcome) and after 1-month follow-up (T2); (3) 
compare the effect of MCA vs AAU on diagnoses (num -
ber of diagnostic revisions) and treatment offered (num -
ber of patients offered other or additional treatment) in 
patients referred to group therapy for social phobia or 
AvPD, as well as adherence to group therapy within the 
first 4 weeks; and (4) develop a fidelity checklist for the 
MCA intervention.
We hypothesize that MCA is feasible regarding accept -
ance and adherence in patients with social phobia or 
AvPD and is superior to AAU in increasing contempla -
tion score (URICA, see below) at the end of interven -
tion (T1). (2) In addition to this, patients offered MCA 
have higher service satisfaction ratings (CSQ) than those 
offered AAU prior to psychotherapy onset, and user eval -
uation scores of MCA (purpose-made) are positive (more 
than 3 on a 1–5 Likert Scale).
Methods
Design
The present protocol is based on reporting guidelines 
from the SPIRIT guideline for Standard Protocol Items 
for Clinical Trials [45] adapted as recommended when 
reporting protocols of feasibility trials [46]. The study 
is designed in order to inform and evaluate the feasibil -
ity of a possible future, full-scale RCT of MCA versus 
AAU. We will evaluate the feasibility of the interventions 
in terms of clinician resources and patient’s acceptabil -
ity and adherence to the intervention and comparator, 
selected based on recommendations for the conduct of 
feasibility trials [47–49].
In addition to these feasibility outcomes, we will assess 
outcomes regarding readiness for change, symptoms, and 
regarding self-esteem and self-efficacy. Data are gathered 
from patients through a number of questionnaires deliv -
ered by the RedCap © webmodule prior to randomiza -
tion (T0), at the end of MCA (T1) and after 4 weeks of 
psychotherapy (T2)—the absolute time depends on clini -
cal logistics and timing of group therapy onset.
Trial design
A two-armed, parallel randomized controlled feasibility 
and superiority trial comparing the effect of pre-treat -
ment MCA with AAU.A CONSORT diagram is provided in Fig.  1. A diagram 
of the proposed study and the outcome assessment is 
provided in Fig.  2. The trial data collection and randomi -
zation, stratified by gender, will be carried out in the web-
based data management system REDCap (https:// www. 
proje  ct- redcap. org/). Self-ratings will also be collected on 
the web-based REDCap platform.
Setting
The setting of the study is Psychiatry South in Region 
Zealand, which is a rural region with several medium-
sized cities, according to Danish standards. Three of 
these cities have psychiatric outpatient clinics (Maribo, 
Slagelse, and Naestved), which carry out psychothera -
peutic treatment of patients with emotional disorders 
too serious to be managed by family doctors and pri -
mary sector psychologists and psychiatrists. Patients are 
typically referred by general practitioners, when they 
have failed to respond to one or two different treatments 
(medication and/or psychotherapy). The services in these 
clinics are covered by Danish public health insurance and 
involve both psychotherapy and psychopharmacologi -
cal treatment (see also the “Introduction and rationale” 
section).
Participants and eligibility criteria
We aim to include 42 patients who satisfy the inclusion 
criteria: (1) a patient with a tentative ICD-10 diagnosis of 
either SP or AvPD, (2) who is going to be offered treat -
ment in the aforementioned clinics, (3) is 18–65 years of 
age, (4) has given written consent to participate, and (5) 
has sufficient knowledge of the Danish language.
Patients will be excluded if (1) the risk of suicide is 
high or moderate according to the investigator, (2) they 
have alcohol or drug dependency, and (3) they have a 
co-occurring eating disorder with BMI < 18 or psychotic 
illness.
Recruitment
In the first consultation at the psychiatric clinic, clini -
cians will evaluate if the patient is eligible for psycho -
therapeutic treatment and stipulate a clinical diagnosis. 
If patients are eligible for treatment in the clinic, they 
will be invited to an information meeting with the first 
author, where they will be provided with information 
about the project. Following this, they can give informed 
consent to participate.
Randomization and blinding
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either the MCA or 
AAU on an individual level. Allocation to experimental 
intervention or comparison intervention will be com -
puter-generated using the software REDCap © [50].
Page 5 of 11
 Hovmand et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:102 
 
Due to the nature of the intervention, neither participants 
nor the researcher who will administer the intervention can be 
blinded to allocation. However, data will be re-coded for con -
cealment and analyzed without access to information about 
allocation. The conclusion will be written prior to unblinding.
Experimental intervention
The MCA, as described in the “Introduction and 
rationale” section, will include the possible adminis -
tration of the following nine assessment instruments:
Present State Examination (PSE)
PSE is a semi-structured interview that seeks to provide 
an objective evaluation of symptoms associated with 
mental disorders. It consists of 140 items and is scored 
on a 3-point or 4-point scale [51].
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‑5 (SCID‑5)
SCID-5PD is a semi-structured interview guide for eval -
uation of the 10 DSM-5 Personality Disorders.The Examination of Anomalous Self‑Experience (EASE)
EASE is a semi-structured checklist for clinical-phe -
nomenological exploration of experiential distur -
bances. Scores are summed up in a global score, with 
five sub-scores: Cognition and stream of consciousness, 
Self-awareness and presence, Bodily experiences, Demar -
cation/transitivism, and Existential reorientation [52].
The Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP)
SCIP is a neuropsychological test for quick and objec -
tive quantification of cognitive function in patients with 
psychiatric disorders. The Danish translation has dem -
onstrated validity for the detection of objective cognitive 
impairment [53]. It assesses verbal learning and memory, 
delayed memory, working memory, word mobilization, 
and processing speed [54].
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS‑2)
ADOS-2, module 4 [55], is a semi-structured and stand -
ardized observation of communication, social interac -
tion, and creative use of materials used to assess autism 
spectrum disorder pathology.

Page 6 of 11 Hovmand et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:102 
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Fourth Edition 
(WAIS‑IV)
The WAIS is an IQ test designed to measure intelligence 
and cognitive ability in adults and older adolescents [56].
Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS)
The CAARS is a test developed to diagnose attention 
problems, such as ADHD and ADD. It provides both Self-
Report and Observer Report Forms, permitting multi -
modal assessment of adults with attention problems [57].
Level of Personality Functioning—Brief Form 2.0 (LPFS‑BF)
LPFS-BF is a brief 12-item self-report inventory devel -
oped to assess levels of personality functioning, as 
defined in the alternative model for personality disorders 
in DSM-5 Section III. It measures impairment in person -
ality functioning within the domains of self-functioning 
and interpersonal functioning [58].
Personality Inventory for DSM‑5, 36‑item version (PID‑36)
The PID-36 is an abbreviated version of the originally 
100-item version of the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 
(PID-5), which was developed to measure the pathologi -
cal trait specifiers listed in the alternative model for per -
sonality disorders in DSM-5 Section III [59].
The instruments will be administered by the first 
author. No other clinicians or therapists will see the 
included patients in this period of time. Materials from 
the medical record and from the full MCA will be pre -
sented for case supervision with a senior psychiatrist, 
with the option of getting an additional opinion from 
another senior consultant in case of diagnostic uncer -
tainty. This procedure is included in order to ensure solid 
diagnostic verification or alteration. Therapists and teams 
are informed of the results of the MCA, in order for them 
to use the extra information about the patient in the fol -
lowing psychotherapeutic intervention, which will be 
administered after completion of the primary endpoint.Comparison intervention
Patients allocated to the control group will receive AAU, 
which is the standard assessment that patients receive 
in the clinic, administered as follows: the patients are 
referred to the clinic by a family doctor or a private prac -
tice psychiatrist. On intake to the clinic, they will receive 
a diagnostic interview with either a medical doctor or a 
psychologist which can be supplemented with specific 
psychological tests, (e.g., SCID-5) when personality dis -
orders are suspected, depending on the current resources 
and competencies in the clinics and following request 
from the head of treatment. Supplementary assessment is 
indicated roughly in one case out of ten. Otherwise, AAU 
patients are on the waitlist for the group therapy and are 
not followed by any therapist. Following the end of the 
MCA intervention, MCA patients might also wait a short 
while for group therapy, not seeing any psychotherapist 
in that interval. As all participants start group therapy, 
they will have a designated contact person, but only one 
preparatory individual therapy session before entering 
the specific treatment group.
Intervention fidelity
The intervention will be carried out by the first author, 
a resident in psychiatry. He has received training and 
supervision on the assessment battery from national 
experts in the field. The intervention will be supervised 
by the third author, who is trained in therapeutic assess -
ment. Audio or video recordings of MCA consultations 
will be used for supervision purposes and to secure inter -
vention fidelity.
Outcomes’ objective 1: Feasibility
• Acceptability: The feasibility criterion for acceptabil -
ity in patients is supported if 25% of patients who are 
found eligible for inclusion and who have received for -

mal information (information meeting with the first 
author) about the trial agree to participate in the trial.
• Satisfaction: The feasibility criterion for satisfaction 
in patients is supported if the mean CSQ-8 score 
is ≥ 3 (see below for description of instrument).
• Adherence: The feasibility criteria for adherence in 
patients is supported if 75% complete the MCA inter -
vention (attend all MCA sessions including feedback-
session).
• Time spent on the intervention: We evaluate the 
resources used to complete the study by recording 
the time spent in direct contact with the patient used 
to complete the MCA intervention [48].
• Evaluation of the Intervention Questionnaire (EQ)
• Adverse events
Outcomes’ objective 2: Trial outcomes
See Table 1 for a table of measurements.
Primary outcome
University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA)
URICA is a 32-item self-report measure including 4 sub -
scales, designed to quantify the patient’s motivation for 
change: The four subscales are Pre-contemplation, Con -
templation, Action, and Maintenance [60]. We will utilize 
the Contemplation score as our primary outcome.
Secondary outcomes
The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale‑Self‑Report (LSAS)
The self-administered 24-item LSAS-SR [60], which is 
highly correlated with the clinician-administered version 
[61], includes questions pertaining to social interaction and 
performance situations. The LSAS-SR has shown to have 
good convergent, discriminant validity, and reliability [62].Rosenberg Self‑Esteem Scale (RSES)
The RSES is a 10-item measure of self-esteem that 
includes five positive items and five negative items which 
are reverse-scored [63]. In general, the RSES has dem -
onstrated good convergent validity and good test–retest 
reliability, and in similar populations of adults with social 
phobia, the RSES has demonstrated high internal consist -
ency [64].
General Self‑Efficacy Scale (GSES)
The GSES is a 10-item psychometric scale that is 
designed to assess optimistic self-beliefs to cope with a 
variety of difficult demands in life. In contrast to other 
scales that were designed to assess optimism, this one 
explicitly refers to personal agency, i.e., the belief that 
one’s actions are responsible for successful outcomes [65, 
66].
Exploratory outcomes
Readiness for Psychotherapy Index
The RPI is a 42-item self-report measure that uses a 
5-point Likert scale to assess 7 dimensions of readiness 
for psychotherapy: level of distress, desire for change, 
willingness to work in therapy, recognition of problems 
as psychological, willingness to discuss personal mat -
ters, willingness to endure discomfort in therapy, and 
responsibility for change [67]. The questionnaire will be 
translated and validated for use in a Danish mental health 
service population as part of the present study.
National Patient‑Reported Outcome Measures 
(PROM)‑Psychiatry
The Danish National PROM is a 19-item self-report 
measure covering patients’ own views on their mental 
and physical health and level of general well-being [68]. 
It includes the WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5), the 
Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) [69], and 
general items from the SF36.
Data from Electronic Health Records (EHR)
We will monitor the number of no-shows and the num -
ber of diagnostic re-classifications by accessing the 
included patients’ EHR.
User evaluations
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ‑8)
The CSQ-8 is a self-report questionnaire, constructed to 
measure satisfaction with services received by individuals 
and families [70].Table 1 Table of measurements CO-ASSM-RCT

Evaluation of the Intervention Questionnaire (EQ)
This questionnaire focusing on the patient’s and thera -
pist’s evaluation of the intervention, which is purpose-
made for the current study, will be distributed at the end 
of the intervention. Items will be constructed as Likert 
Scale feedback forms consisting of a list of statements 
about different aspects of the course of the intervention. 
Response possibilities are five categories ranging from 
“very much in agreement” to “not at all. ”
Adverse effects
We expect no serious risks or adverse effects to the 
included patients. We monitor for adverse events, in par -
ticular suicidal behavior/ideation, and will check for this 
at every visit to the clinic. If a patient is admitted during 
participation in the study, a senior consultant (RB) will 
decide whether the patient can continue to participate.
Patient and public involvement
We will establish a user panel who will help interpret the 
findings of the study, and we will include the feedback in 
our reporting of the findings of the present study, and in 
the preparations for a possible full-scale phase-3 study of 
the intervention. The user panel will include five patients 
recruited from the clinics and they will meet two times 
throughout the study. They will be users of the Danish 
MHS but not participants in this trial.
Statistical considerations
As the primary objective of the present trial is to test fea -
sibility, a formal power calculation is not required. How -
ever, the present trial also wishes to examine MCA versus 
AAU, and we present the following power calculation 
for the primary outcome: readiness for change. Sample 
size calculation is based on figures in Dozois et al. [71] of 
patients with panic/anxiety, where the primary outcome 
“Contemplation stage score” in readiness for change was 
mean 37.3 (SD 1.9) for CBT responders and mean 34.4 
(std 3.4) for non-responders, i.e., with significance level 
5% and power 90%. This yields a total sample of 36 with 
18 patients in each arm. We strive for 42 patients to 
account for attrition around 15%. We find it feasible to 
include the 42 patients since 64 patients are offered treat -
ment packages annually (40 SP and 24 AvPD).
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be published 
on ClinicalTrials.gov prior to data processing initia -
tion. Briefly, we expect to report descriptive data such as 
data for the feasibility criterion as percentages, means, 
and variation as standard deviation. Outcomes will be 
analyzed as continuous and categorical measures (i.e., 
responder status and new diagnosis, see below). All sta -
tistical analyses will be performed as intention-to-treat 
analyses (ITT); however, main outcomes will also be analyzed for completers only for sensitivity reasons. 
Missing data will be handled by the use of multiple impu -
tations. The pre- to post-treatment effects of the MCU 
or AAU will be determined utilizing a series of repeated 
measures analyses of variance (rmANOVAs). Analysis 
will be based on masked data (recoded data for conceal -
ment of allocation). Conclusions of the main outcomes 
will be formulated prior to unmasking the data. Statisti -
cal calculations will be performed prior to unblinding. 
All statistical calculations will be performed in R and 
RStudio [72].
Dissemination policy
The results of the present study will be disseminated by 
the Psychiatric Research Unit social media account and 
website. We will also seek to publish it through high-
impact international peer-reviewed journals and pre -
sent it at conferences for clinicians, commissioners, and 
researchers working in the mental health field. Both neg -
ative and positive findings will be published. The trial is 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Nr 2,021,001). Although 
steps will be taken to avoid it, protocol deviations may 
happen. Protocol deviations that occur after the start of 
trial recruitment will be communicated at https:// clini 
caltr  ials. gov and detailed in publications.
Trial status
The trial began recruitment in October 2021, and the last 
participant is expected to be included in January 2023. 
The experimental intervention ran from November 2021 
to April 2023.
Discussion
The current study will be the first RCT investigating 
MCA in a mental health service setting. It will be a fea -
sibility study and will test the study hypothesis in a small 
clinical sample. If the present study is successful, it may 
be followed up by other, larger clinical studies on MCA. 
The study will contribute to sparse existing research con -
cerning the impact of clinical assessment; it will provide 
important new knowledge about the effects of routine 
and systematic patient-centered clinical assessment and 
generate effect size measures for future power calcula -
tions. It will also generate data regarding patients’ readi -
ness for psychotherapy, and the percentage of patients 
who are wrongly diagnosed in a prototypical Danish pub -
lic psychotherapeutic healthcare clinic.
We believe that the intervention will have a posi -
tive effect on the included patients. However, there is 
a risk that the patients receiving MCA may not benefit 
from the excess assessment but that the treatment will 
instead increase dropout due to the patient becoming 
overwhelmed. There is also a possibility of the patients

 Hovmand et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:102 
 
becoming upset or disappointed due to the new knowl -
edge they receive about themselves. Ultimately, the MCA 
may yield an unexpected diagnosis which could severely 
change the way the patient sees herself and the way soci -
ety in general sees the patient. Many of these problems 
may, however, also occur in AAU. We will evaluate this 
by comparison of dropout from MCA and AAU.
If the current project documents the feasibility of the 
approach, further studies should examine the incre -
mental value of MCA on patient outcome in terms of 
treatment completion or number of treatment sessions 
attended, and cost-effectiveness.
By the end of the present project, we will be able to 
decide whether the results are sufficiently promising to 
pursue a full trial (phase III) [73]. For that purpose, the 
study output also encompasses the development of a 
MCA protocol for clinicians and an adjoining fidelity 
instrument.
