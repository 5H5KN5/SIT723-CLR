In this pilot study, the effects of two computer-assisted dieting (CAD)
interventions on weight loss and blood chemistry were examined among
overweight and obese adults. Participants (91 community members, average age42.6 years) were randomly assigned to CAD-only (a single-session introductionand provision of a dieting software, n¼30), CAD plus an additional four-session
self-management group training (CAD þG,n¼31) and a waitlist control group
whose members were randomised into the two interventions at the 3-monthfollow-up ( n¼30). A three (group)-by-two (time) repeated measures ANOVA
revealed no significant group by time interaction during the initial 3-month
period. However, the two intervention groups combined showed a significant,
though moderate weight loss relative to the control group. Further, although ageneral improvement was found with regard to the lipid panel results during the
first 3 months of the trial, the treatment by time interaction was not significant. A
comparison of the developments in the two intervention groups during the 3- to 6-month follow-up time period revealed a tendency towards greater weight regain inthe CAD-only condition. The evidence suggests that CAD supports initial weight
loss; however, additional self-management training might be necessary to support
maintenance.

Introduction
The latest data from the National Center for Health Statistics indicate that 32.2% of US
adults are obese with a body mass index (BMI) /C2130, and an additional 34% are
overweight with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 (NCHS, 2006). This translates into anestimate of about 136 million adults in the US who are either overweight or obese and,thus, at increased risk for a number of weight-related and highly prevalent healthconditions including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke,osteoarthritis and certain types of cancer (AHA, 2006; CDC, 2006; NIH, 1998).
Obesity and related health risks are strongly affected by common behavioural factors
involving unhealthy eating habits combined with a sedentary lifestyle. Thus, a healthylifestyle appears to be the primary answer to obesity and its associated healthcomplications (NIH, 1998). With regard to dieting, the recommendations include

a balanced diet that is low in fat and cholesterol, high in fibre, and limited in
calories (NIH, 1998; USDA & USHS, 2000). In terms of behaviour change,these recommendations translate primarily into a reduction of added fats, oilsand sweets, a reduction of animal products high in saturated fats, and an increasein vegetable and fruit consumption to a minimum of five servings per day (USDA
& USHS, 2000).
Both nutrition education and weight loss interventions would gain much by
an inclusion of objective physiological indicators of improved dietary habits suchas lipid panel and blood glucose results. Among nutrition intervention trials, only aboutone-third of the studies include any physiological health outcomes (Contento, Randell, &Basch, 2002). Further, hardly any nutrition intervention study includes the full range ofoutcome measures, including weight, and further indicators of improved health.
Given the limitations of the existing research, the current study was designed to test the
effects of two brief, computer-assisted dieting (CAD) interventions on weight loss and
related physiological health outcomes among overweight and obese adults. Bothinterventions featured a brief, educational component in a group setting, which introducedparticipants to the mutual goal of weight loss combined with a balanced diet as defined bythe US Department of Agriculture (USDA & USHS, 2000). Both interventions focused onself-management as the primary target and, thus, addressed individuals in advanced stagesof change who are self-motivated and ready to start a dieting program (Prochaska,Zabinski, Calfas, Sallis, & Patrick, 2000). Volition theory (Heckhausen, 1991; Kuhl, 1985;
Schwarzer, 2002) and the literature on self-management therapy (Kanfer, Gaelick-Buys,
Kanfer, & Goldstein, 1991; Kanfer, Reinecker, & Schmelzer, 2005) provided thetheoretical background of the interventions. Seen from a process perspective, theinterventions focused on the post-intentional, volitional stage of behaviour change(Schwarzer, 2002), which are governed by different cognitive processes than the pre-intentional, motivational stage (Schwarzer, 2008). The theory holds that, once thedecision-making process is completed and a goal intention has been built, the focus ofattention needs to switch from deliberation to implementation, enactment and
maintenance of behaviour (Gollwitzer & Bayer, 1999). The volitional phase typically
involves planning, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, coping with failure, and similar self-management and self-control strategies, specifically if the behaviour in question is difficultto enact and long-term behaviour change is the target (Schroder & Schwarzer, 2005).
Theories of volition and self-regulation emphasise a number of processes as important
mediators of successful goal pursuit. For example, inducing participants to buildimplementation intentions (i.e. intentions to engage in goal-directed actions) has beenfound to facilitate enactment and goal achievement (Gollwitzer & Brandstaetter, 1997).
Further, theories of self-regulation point to the self-monitoring of behaviour as an
indispensable part of successful goal pursuit (Kanfer et al., 1991). Self-monitoring has beenfound to play an important role in the successful self-management of dieting behaviour(Atkins, Depper, Poore, DiLaura, & Djuric, 2005; Glanz, Murphy, Moylan, Evensen, &Curb, 2006; Helsel, Jakicic, & Otto, 2007; Yon, Johnson, Harvey-Berino, Gold, &Howard, 2007). While self-monitoring of nutrition intake is commonly regarded as a corecomponent of a successful dieting intervention, it is unlikely to lead to long-term success inisolation. It needs to be complemented with further self-management strategies such as
self-evaluation and self-reward and the management of specific challenges such as
temptation, craving and the social components of preparing and sharing food(Kanfer et al., 1991, 2005; Kuhl, 1985). In addition, the maintenance of a healthyand weight-conscious diet requires more than a short-term control of behaviour.520 K.E.E. Schroder
It requires the permanent, habitual control of food consumption (Schroder & Schwarzer,
2005).
Based on these considerations, a pilot study was conducted testing the effects of a CAD
intervention, which focused primarily on the self-monitoring of nutrition intake, to a
treatment condition that combined CAD with a more general self-management training,and to a no-treatment control group. The following hypotheses were tested:
(1) A brief CAD intervention will support initial weight loss relative to a no-treatment
waitlist control condition.
(2) Compared to a CAD-only condition, CAD augmented with a self-
management group (CAD þG) intervention will further enhance its effectiveness
and improve the maintenance of weight loss over a longer period of time.
Method
Design
The study featured a three-group randomised controlled design (including two
intervention and one waitlist control group) and three assessment points (fourfor control group members), scheduled in 3-month intervals (Figure 1). One intervention
group was introduced to CAD only. The second group received CAD plus a 4-week group
intervention targeting self-management skills (CAD þG). Both intervention groups were
re-assessed 3 and 6 months following the initial assessment. A no-treatment control group
was followed for the first 3 months only. After completing the first follow-up assessment,
approximately 3 months after entering the study, control group participants wererandomised into the two treatment conditions (CAD-only or CAD þG) and received
treatment. Control group members were re-assessed 3 and 6 months later (Figure 1).
Three-month assessment intervals were chosen to allow for sufficient time to observe any
systematic changes in weight loss and blood chemistry as a result of dietary change. Theprimary outcome of interest was weight loss. Lipid panel analyses served as secondaryoutcomes. Data were collected between September 2004 and July 2005.
Participants
Community members of a mid-size town in the Rocky Mountain region of the US were
recruited through announcements in local newspapers and radio stations. Eligibilitycriteria were (a) being aged 18–65 years; (b) having a BMI /C2127; (c) being interested in
pursuing weight loss; (d) not being diagnosed with diabetes, hypercholesterol or a mental
disorder and (e) having daily access to a personal computer. Recruits were invited to
contact the research team in order to receive further information about the interventionsand to determine additional eligibility criteria, which included: (1) willingness to accept
random group assignment; (2) not being enrolled in an alternative weight loss program; (3)
sufficient English-language proficiency; (4) having no friend or relative already enrolled inthe study, and (5) being in the possession or having ready access to a personal computerwith the following specifications: a Windows operating system compatible with the
software; internet connection and a valid email account. Given budget restrictions, the
maximum sample size was determined as approximately n¼90.
Ninety-four participants who contacted the study team by phone appeared to be
eligible, accepted the terms of the study and were invited to an initial assessment session atPsychology and Health 521
the local psychology community clinic. Two of the 94 participants were found to be
ineligible with a BMI 527, and one participant decided on an alternative weight loss
program. The final sample included 91 participants, 77 women and 14 men who wererandomly assigned to the three treatment groups, separately by gender. Thirty participants(26 women, 4 men) were assigned to the CAD intervention; thirty-one participants (26women, 5 men) were randomised into the CAD þG intervention; and 30 participants (25
women, 5 men) were allocated to the waitlist control group. Participants had an average
age of 42.6 years (SD ¼10.7) and M¼14.8 years of education (SD ¼2.01). All except five
participants were Caucasian. The average monthly household income of participants was$3,758 (SD ¼2304.3). On average, participants had 2.86 children (SD ¼2.4) and 1.49
under-age children living at home (SD ¼1.698). The mean BMI at intake was 34.6Assessed for eligibility & written

found in these demographic variables.
Measures
Primary outcome measure: BMI
Primary outcomes were weight in pounds and body mass index calculated as
BMI¼[weight in pounds/(height in inches)2] * 703. Weight was assessed in 3-month
intervals, once before the intervention and again 3 and 6 months later.
Secondary outcome measures: lipid panel results
Blood samples were analysed using the CardioChek PA Analyser, a highly reliable blood
testing device cleared both for professional medical users and home testing, which provideslipid panel results from a single drop of blood. Lipid panel results provided information
about total blood cholesterol, HDL, LDL, cholesterol ratio (i.e. the ratio of total
cholesterol to HDL) and triglycerides. Total cholesterol, cholesterol ratio and triglycerideswere included as non-redundant secondary outcome measures and objective indicators ofdietary change. All physiological measures were obtained in 3-months interval (Figure 1).
Participants were asked to come in fasting (i.e. with no food or beverage intake during the
past 12 h prior to the assessment sessions).
Procedure
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Utah State University.
Preintervention assessment
During the initial phone contact, participants meeting the eligibility criteria were invited to
an initial assessment session. In this session, all study procedures were explained in detail
and written consent was obtained. Participants were informed that their personal
information would be kept confidential, and that their data would be filed with a randompersonal identification code only.
During the physical exam, height and weight were assessed, and based on this
information, the BMI was calculated. Subsequently, blood samples were analysed deriving
lipid panel results from a single drop of blood. Participant were informed about the test
results and advised to discuss the results with their family physician upon their next visit ifany deviations from normal levels were found.
Once physiological data were collected, participants were led to a separate lab room
where they completed the pre-intervention surveys. Upon return of the study materials to
the research team, participants received a check of $20 as compensation for their time and
expenses.
Randomisation
Randomisation took place following the initial assessment session. Participants were
randomly assigned to CAD þG, CAD-only and control groups by the first author,Psychology and Health 523
separately by gender, in the order of their entry into the study, with every third participant
being assigned to CAD, CAD þG and control groups. Participants were informed by
Email and phone about their group assignment, and those assigned to the two intervention
groups were invited to a 2 h CAD training session. Control group members were informed
that they would receive treatment 3 months later.
Interventions
CAD intervention. The single-session CAD intervention took place in groups at
a university computer lab. The intervention was identical for members of both intervention
groups. All research team members were blind with regard to the type of interventionassigned to the participants (i.e. whether or not they would receive additional self-management training). The intervention focused on (a) goal setting for weight loss anddaily calorie consumption, and (b) self-monitoring of food intake and nutrition. It wasbased on elements emphasized in the literature on self-regulation and self-managementtherapy (Kanfer et al., 1991, 2005). Further, as an educational intervention, the session
focused on dietary guidelines developed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA,
1996).
The session was divided into three parts. In the first part, participants received general
information about healthy nutrition as defined by the USDA food guide pyramid and theSeptember 2002 guidelines issued by the US Institute of Medicine, which form the basis ofthe NutriGenie software. Particular emphasis was placed on the ‘daily five’ (i.e. therecommendation to consume a minimum of two servings of fruit and three servings ofvegetables each day) and a reduction of servings from the ‘fats and sweets’ food group as
the primary strategies to a healthy weight loss. Further, participants were introduced to
the concept of ‘recommended dietary allowances’ (RDAs) and the need to define these foreach individual separately. Using an LCD projector, the various functions of theNutriGenie software were explained. Participants were prepared to use the software as afeedback tool with the dual goal of reducing energy intake and keeping a balanced diet.
During the second part of the session, participants received training in the use of the
software, including searching for food items in a database of more than 8000 entries,reading and interpreting the feedback portion of the screen, and identifying problem foodsin their diet.
The third part of the session involved individualised goal setting with each participant
separately. First, the participant’s daily ‘maintenance calories’ were determined, based on
current weight, gender, age and self-rated activity level. Next, the participant was guided
towards a personal goal of reduced daily energy intake. The goal setting process startedwith the standard suggestions of one pound of weight loss per week, translating into asubtraction of 500 calories from the daily maintenance calories (or a savings of 3500calories per week), which was then discussed with the participant and adjusted, if desired.Finally, participants were guided through the process of adjusting the software settings sothat the RDAs displayed in NutriGenie would match their individual dietary goals.
Participants were instructed to use the software daily and send – at a minimum – the first 7
days of NutriGenie food records by email to the research team.
CADþG intervention. Following the CAD intervention session, participants randomly
assigned to the CAD þG intervention were contacted again by Email and phone524 K.E.E. Schroder
to schedule a weekday and time for the self-management group intervention.
The intervention took place in groups of three to seven participants who met over four
consecutive weeks. In the CAD þG intervention, the self-management components
targeted in the single-session CAD intervention (goal setting, self-monitoring) weresupplemented with further self-management strategies, which were adopted from the self-management therapy (Kanfer et al., 2005), volition theory (Kuhl, 1985), and relapseprevention literature (Marlatt, 2001; Marlatt & Gordon, 1985). These strategies included
behavioural (self-)contracts, self-reward, motivation control, environmental control and
coping with lapses. Further elements informing the interventions, including informationand skills training, were derived from the information-motivation-behavioural skills model(Fisher & Fisher, 1996).
Session 1 focused on information and discussions regarding the development of obesity
in the US, causes of modern obesity and consequences of obesity on health. Following
Weinstein’s precaution adoption process model (Weinstein & Klein, 1996), health risks
were personalised by estimating the risks of coronary heart disease, cancer and diabetes forvolunteers from the group (relative to their normal-weight counterparts), based on theirgender and BMI.
Session 2 focused on self-management skills and introduced participants to a variety of
self-control strategies, which were practiced during and between subsequent sessions.
Further, participants were introduced to the concept of ‘implementation intentions’
(Armitage, 2004; Gollwitzer & Brandstaetter, 1997), which were defined as precisebehavioural plans that specify the time, circumstance or location, actions to be taken andcriteria of success and failure. In an intention-building exercise, each participant was
guided to form an implementation intention to be performed during the next 7 days.
Session 3 focused on maintenance and relapse prevention (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985)
and included sections on problem diagnosis and problem-solving strategies. Participants
were encouraged to view their dieting effort as a learning process that necessarily involvesaction slips and to adopt an ‘action-oriented mind-set’ (Gollwitzer & Brandstaetter, 1997)by focusing on problem-solving activities.
Session 4 was designed to discuss social and environmental influence on dieting success
and dieting failure, consolidate relapse prevention skills, develop long-term dieting goals,
and wrap up the content of the four sessions. With regard to relapse prevention,
participants were taught to identify negative thoughts and to substitute efficient (action-oriented) for inefficient, demoralising attributions of lapse. The social component includeda discussion of hospitality norms and social pressure to eat as well as effective strategies to
deal with these barriers. Participants were encouraged to inform their social network about
their dieting goals and solicit social support among their friends and relatives.
Skills training was consolidated through homework assignments between sessions,
such as short-term self-control tasks, the development of clearly defined short- and long-term goals and a respective list of self-rewards to be applied upon successful completion.
Wait-list control group. No treatment was offered to participants assigned to the wait-list
control group during the first 3 months. Upon completion of the second assessmentsession (Time 2, 3 months after the initial assessment session), returning participants
(n¼26) were randomly assigned to one of the two interventions (CAD-only or CAD þG).
The interventions applied to members of the waitlist-control group matched exactly theinterventions applied to the original intervention groups.Psychology and Health 525
Follow-up assessments
Participants in the CAD-only and CAD þG interventions were followed for a total of 6
months (i.e. completed two follow-ups in 3-month time intervals). The follow-upassessments involved all measures included in the initial assessment session (i.e. weight
and BMI, physical exams including blood draws). For participants in the wait-list control
group, an additional assessment session was scheduled 9 months after intake in order to
retrieve a 6-month follow-up assessment since initiation of treatment. Each assessment
session was reimbursed with $20.00; in addition, participants earned $10.00 for the returnof the food diaries and $10.00 for the completion and Email submission of at least 7 days
of food recording with the NutriGenie software, to be paid at their next appointment. In
total, participants could earn up to $80.00 ($100.00 in the waitlist control group).
Data preparation and analysis
Data preparationTwo preparatory steps were performed. First, outlier values were replaced with the raw
score corresponding to the limit value of z¼/C63. Across all variables and assessment
occasions, 27 outliers were identified (i.e. 1.15% of all scores). Second, in order to include
participants who did not attend all of the follow-ups, missing data points were replaced
with pre-intervention scores, applying a conservative approach to the testing of
intervention effects.
Analyses
Test of Hypothesis 1. According to Hypothesis 1, CAD (with or without additional self-
management intervention) should support initial weight loss. In order to test Hypothesis 1,
a three (groups) by two (T1 vs. T2) repeated measures ANOVA was performed with BMIas the dependent variable. Both a priori and posteriori power analyses indicated limited
test power for the crucial treatment by time interaction effect. An a priori power analysis
performed with SPSS16, adopting data from Wylie-Rosett et al. (2001), indicated that a
minimum sample size of approximately N=126 (42 per group) would be needed to achieve
a test power of 0.80 at /C11¼0.05 assuming no weight change in a no-treatment control
group and a weight reduction of 4.7 lbs and 7.4 lbs in the two treatment conditions.
Therefore, the two treatment groups were combined to contrast weight loss in
the intervention conditions against the control condition in a two (treatments vs. control)
by-two (T1 vs. T2) post hoc ANOVA. In addition, alpha was set to 0.10 ( /C11=0.05, one
tailed) for tests of the group-by-time interactions. Given the strong overlap between weightand BMI ( r¼0.81), only BMI was used in all but descriptive analyses.
Further, to test treatment effects on blood chemistry, a corresponding two (groups)-by-
two (time) repeated measures MANOVA was performed with total cholesterol, cholesterol
ratio and triglyceride counts as dependent variables. Univariate results were reportedadjusting for familywise error rate (i.e. adjusting for the number of dependent variables
included).
Significant group-by-time interactions were followed by simple repeated measures
ANOVA F-tests, which tested change over time in treatment and control conditions
separately. To control familywise error rate, tests of simple main effects adjusted the
critical /C11-level for the number of possible simple main effects, following Dunn’s procedure
as described in Kirk (1995).526 K.E.E. Schroder
Tests of Hypothesis 2. In order to test Hypothesis 2, the two treatment conditions were
compared across the entire sample to evaluate differential development in the CAD-only
and the CAD þG interventions. For all physiological outcomes (BMI, lipid panels), the
data of the waitlist control group participants were merged with the two interventiongroups (CAD-only, CAD þG), according to the condition to which they were randomised
at T2. In order to synchronize control group data with the three- and six-month follow up
assessment points of the two original intervention groups, the T3 data of the control groupmembers (marking their first follow-up) were merged with T2 data of the intervention
groups; further, T4 data (which were collected in the control group only and established
their 6-month follow-up) were merged with T3 data of the intervention groups.
To compare the maintenance of any initial treatment effects in the two treatment
conditions over time, a two (CAD-only vs. CADþG)-by-two (3-month vs. 6-month follow-
up) repeated measures ANOVA was performed with BMI as dependent variable. Onceagain, a priori power analyses indicated a lack of test power. Assuming a weight regain of
about 4.5 lbs in the CAD-only condition and no weight change in the CAD+G condition,
a sample size of n=170 (85 per group) would be needed to obtain a test power of 0.80 atp50.05 for the crucial group-by-time interaction. Accordingly, alpha was set to 0.10
(/C11¼0.85 one tailed)
Further, a corresponding two (groups)-by-two (time) repeated measures MANOVA
was performed with lipid panel results. Univariate results were reported adjusting forfamilywise error rate (i.e. adjusting for the number of dependent variables included).
Simple effect ANOVAs were performed for the time factor, testing change over the 6-
month period in the two intervention groups separately. Familywise error rate wasadjusted by correcting the alpha level for multiple simple effects ANOVAs as
recommended by Kirk (1995).
All analyses followed an intent-to-treat approach (Davidson et al., 2003), analyzing
participants as members of the group to which they were randomly assigned, irrespective
of whether they received the respective treatment. For all analyses effect size estimates in
the population were calculated as partial !

Results
Change over time during the initial 3-month interval in treatment and control groups
Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for the outcome variables by condition
and assessment period. A three (group)-by-two (time) repeated measures ANOVA (not
tabled) showed a significant effect of time only (Wilks’ /C21¼0.778, F(1.88)¼25.05,
p50.001). Although there was a tendency towards greater weight loss in both
intervention groups relative to the control group during the first 3 months of the study,
the group-by-time interaction was not significant (Wilks’ /C21¼0.955, F(2.88)¼2.07,
p¼0.132, !2
p¼0.012).
Given the fact that the two intervention groups showed almost identical treatment
effects, and in order to improve test power, a post hoc analysis was performed, combining
the two treatment conditions. A two (interventions vs. control)-by-two (T1 vs. T2)
repeated measures ANOVA resulted in a highly significant change over time (Wilks’
/C21¼0.844, F(1.89)¼16.41, p50.001, !2
p¼0.087) and a significant group-by-time interac-
tion (Wilks’ /C21¼0.955, F(1.89)¼4.193, p50.044, !2
p¼0.02; see Table 2). The main effect of
groups was not significant. The two treatment groups taken together reduced their weight
from M¼217.52 (SD ¼36.85) at Time 1 to 213.84 (SD ¼36.07), reflecting an averagePsychology and Health 527
weight loss of 3.68 pounds and 0.57 BMI units during the first 3 months of the trial. The
respective simple main effect was highly significant with a substantial effect sizeof!

p¼0.182 (Wilks’ /C21¼0.691, F(1.89)¼28.17, p50.001). Among control group

Next, a two (intervention vs. control)-by-two (T1–T2) repeated measures MANOVA
was performed with the lipid panel data. Only the multivariate effect of time was
significant (Wilks’ /C21¼0.747, F(3.85)¼9.60, p50.001, !2

time showed a significant reduction across the entire sample in total cholesterol(F

Comparison of weight loss maintenance in the two intervention groups
According to Hypothesis 2, CAD augmented by a self-management group intervention
should be more successful in preventing weight regain than CAD alone. This hypothesis
was tested with a two (CAD-only vs. CAD þG)-by-two (3-month vs. 6-month follow-up)
ANOVA using BMI as dependent variable and integrating control group membersaccording to the treatment to which they were randomised at T2. Only the group-by-time
interaction was significant at the significance level of /C11¼0.10 applied to the interactions
(Wilks’ /C21¼0.961, F
(1.85)¼3.45, p¼0.067, !2
p¼0.014). The main effects of time and groups
were not significant. To further investigate the nature of the significant interaction, simple
repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for the two groups separately. In the CAD-
only condition, a significant weight regain of 2.32 pounds was observed ( /C1BMI¼0.36
units; F(1.85)¼5.70, p50.05, !2
p¼0.052). In contrast, no weight change was observed in
the CAD þG condition between the two follow-up assessment points ( /C1BMI¼/C00.04
units; F(1.85)¼0.05, ns), indicating that the members of this group retained, on average,
their initial weight loss of about 3.5 pounds (Table 3).
A corresponding MANOVA with lipid panel results revealed a significant multivariate
effects of time (Wilks’ /C13¼0.877, F(3.83)¼3.87, p¼0.012, !2
p¼0.047) but no significant
main effects of time and treatment condition (Table 4). Univariate tests for time showed a
significant increase in total cholesterol ( F(1.85)¼11.67, p¼0.01, !2
p¼0.058). Although the
increase in total cholesterol was stronger in the CAD-only condition relative to theCADþG condition, the group-by-time interaction was not significant. No further
significant effects were found.
Discussion
The results of this pilot study indicate that CAD interventions can assist overweight
individuals in losing weight without the prescription of a specific diet or calorie limit. BothCAD-only and CAD augmented by self-management group training produced greaterweight loss during the first 3 months of the trial compared to the waitlist control group.Table 3. 3-month and 6-month follow-up means ( M) and standard deviations (SD) in the two

The initial success of the interventions can best be attributed to the introduction of the
NutriGenie software as a self-monitoring device, in combination with personalised goalsetting and feedback. During the first 3 months of the trial, the four-session self-
management group intervention did not appear to provide any additional benefits beyond
the effects that were achieved with a one-session CAD intervention plus software. In bothintervention groups, an approximate weight loss of 3.7 pounds was observed. However, a
tendency towards differential effects of the two intervention conditions became apparent
at the 6-month follow-up. CAD-only was not successful in helping participants maintaintheir initial weight loss over time. On average, CAD-only members returned to their
original weight. In contrast, CAD þG participants were able to fully retain their initial
weight loss. Thus, the additional self-management training, although not necessarily more
successful in accelerating weight loss in the initial phase of an intervention trial, may be
more successful in preventing weight regains.
Both interventions were based on volition theory (Kuhl, 1985; Schwarzer, 1992, 2002)
and used elements highlighted in the self-control literature (Kanfer et al., 1991, 2005). The
interventions targeted the post-intentional, volitional phase of behaviour change, focusing
on action control among individuals whose goals are set. Volitional interventions focus onstrategies that enhance the intention-behaviour congruency and thus, the likelihood of
goal achievement. Both interventions targeted self-monitoring as a basic tool in the process
of self-induced change. However, long-term behaviour change requires more than a short-
term application of self-monitoring as the arguably most crucial element of self-
management. The hypothesis underlying the CAD þG intervention claimed that general
self-control skills need to be improved to support long-term maintenance of a healthy and
weight-friendly diet (Schroder & Schwarzer, 2005). Thus, the four-session group
interventions targeted a variety of important supplemental self-management skills andstrategies, with a strong focus on long-term maintenance. The study does not allow
separating the specific components that were particularly useful in supporting long-term
maintenance of weight loss. However, it is most likely that an improvement in general self-management skills and not an isolated strategy is responsible for greater long-term success.
Why did the interventions not lead to the desired weight loss of one pound per week?
One reason for the modest weight loss may reside in the fact that an estimate ofTable 4. Two (CAD-only vs. CADþG)-by-two (3-month to 6-month follow-up) repeated measures

‘maintenance calories’, and thus, the calorie limit required to achieve a weight loss of one
pound per week were, in part, based on participant ratings of physical activity, whichmight reflect over-estimates of current activity levels or unrealistic estimates of futureactivity. Alternatively, participants may have failed to adhere or consciously decided torelax calorie restrictions on numerous personal or public holidays during the course of the
study. Finally, the interventions may not have been intense enough to support the
substantial weight loss targeted by the participants. Thus, future interventions may need toexpand on the number of sessions, apply a more accurate measure of calorie expenditure incalculating individual calorie limits, and work more intensely on factors that limitsuccessful weight control.
How do the results of this study compare to the effects of similar intervention trials
reported in the literature? In contrast to previous computer-tailored dieting interventions(Kroeze, Werkman, & Brug, 2006), our study featured weight loss as the primary outcome
of interest. To our knowledge, only few CAD interventions reported in the literature
evaluated intervention effects on weight loss. Among recruits from a health maintenanceorganisation, Wylie-Rosett et al. (2001) reported an average weight loss of 4.7 pounds overthe course of a year for a combined (dieting and exercise) computer-assisted lifestyleintervention and an average weight loss of 7.4 pounds for the same interventionaugmented by staff counselling. Similarly, Hunter et al. (2008) reported about the resultsof a 24-week internet-based weight control intervention featuring weekly internet lessons,electronic food and exercise diaries, weekly counsellor feedback and two motivational
interviewing sessions with the counsellor over the course of the intervention. While
intervention completers experienced an average weight loss of 3 lbs, usual care controlparticipants gained about 1.3 lbs over a 6-month period. These results appear to bestronger than the intervention effects achieved in the present study; however, both theresults reported in Wylie-Rosett et al. (2001) and Hunter et al. (2008) refer to completersonly. Using study completers only (i.e. participants who returned to at least one follow-up), the average weight loss in the present study was about 4.2 pounds in the twointervention groups, which compares well with the findings of these authors.
In sum, there is strong evidence that computer-assisted interventions can provide an
efficient, easy to implement, and low-cost alternative to traditional lifestyle interventionsthat are considerably more cost-intensive and less feasible for broad dissemination.Although an average weight loss of only 3.7 pounds in the intent-to-treat analyses mightappear small (translating into a 1.7% reduction in body weight), the long-term benefits ofa brief nutrition education combined with self-monitoring and self-management skillstraining might be more impressive with greater follow-up intervals. More aggressiveweight loss interventions achieve greater initial weight reductions (NIH, 1998); however, it
is questionable whether these are retained over long periods of time, once participants
return to less restrictive eating habits.
Several limitations of the present study may constrain the generalisation of the results.
First, the relatively small sample size limits external validity and indicates the need forreplication. Second, interventions focusing on self-monitoring and additional self-management skills might not be successful among persons lacking the self-motivation tolose weight. That is, patients transferred to a dietary program by their health care provider(rather than seeking out a weight-loss program on their own) may not benefit from self-
management tools and training without a preceding motivation-building intervention.
Third, the generalisation of our results is limited to a population matching thecharacteristics of our sample, which was dominated by white, middle-aged, well-educated,primarily female participants recruited in a metropolitan area of the mid-WesternPsychology and Health 531
United States. Fourth, the long-term self-monitoring of dietary intake requires constant
computer access, which might limit the feasibility of this approach to individuals who arein the possession of a personal computer. Finally, the limited number of male participantsin this study did not allow testing for gender differences and further limits thegeneralisability of the findings.
In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that a computerised nutrition
intervention may have potential in supporting self-guided weight loss attempts amongoverweight and obese people. However, the intervention may need to be refined andintensified in order to achieve greater effectiveness. Although additional self-managementtraining appears to be a promising approach towards long-term success, no data areavailable beyond the 6 months following the introduction to the nutrition software.Further research would need to evaluate long-term effects of CAD-based interventions onweight loss as well as the need for additional self-management booster sessions beyond theinitial intervention phase.
