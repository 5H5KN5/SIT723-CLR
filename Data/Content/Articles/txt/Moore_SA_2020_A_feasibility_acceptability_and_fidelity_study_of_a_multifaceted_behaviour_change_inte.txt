of a multifaceted behaviour change
intervention targeting free-living physical
activity and sedentary behaviour in
community dwelling adult stroke survivors

Abstract
Background: Despite the benefits of physical activity for walking ability, balance, and mood, less than 30% of stroke
survivors engage in recommended levels of physical activity with high levels of sedentary behaviour observed. This
study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability and fidelity of a theory- and evidence-based multifaceted behaviour
change intervention targeting free-living physical activity and sedentary behaviour after stroke.
Methods: This study will be set in community stroke services in the North East of England and will assess the feasibility
of a behaviour change intervention targeting free-living physical activity and sedentary behaviour of stroke survivors
andconsultation behaviour of the healthcare professionals to support stroke survivors to make these lifestyle changes.
Up to 35 stroke survivors currently receiving stroke rehabilitation within the study catchment area with capacity andno
contraindications to increasing physical activity/reducing sedentary behaviour will be recruited. Stroke survivors will
receive a supported self-management physical activity/sedentary behaviour programme incorporating provision of
information, goal setting, action planning, barrier identification, coping planning, self-monitoring and feedback on
physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The programme will be supported by up to 12 healthcare professionals
(HCPs) recruited from the community stroke services taking part in the study. The HCPs will deliver at least two face-to-
face sessions (baseline, review and subsequent reviews if necessary) and provide a range of personalised tools to
support each individual stroke survivor (e.g. workbook, self-monitoring tools, information on local resources). The
consultation behaviour of the HCPs will be targeted via a training programme incorporating face-to-face training, a
training manual and individual feedback on intervention programme delivery from the study research team. The
feasibility, acceptability and fidelity of the study protocol will be assessed.

Discussion: The most effective methods of supporting stroke survivors to alter physical activity and sedentary
behaviour have yet to be established. This study will establish the feasibility of delivering a complex theory- and
evidence-based intervention targeting the behaviour of both stroke survivors and HCPs and assess whether it is
acceptable to the target populations. Findings will inform the iterative development of the intervention before a larger
scale evaluation.

Background
Increasing physical activity levels and reducing sedentary
behaviour (e.g. the time spent sitting or lying) can im-
prove health outcomes and reduce mortality [ 1,2].
Home and community physical activity levels are con-
sistently low after stroke, with stroke survivors spending
the majority of their day either sitting or lying down [ 3,
4]. Numerous barriers to engagement in physical activity
have been cited after stroke including stroke-related im-
pairments, lack of professional support, reduced self-
efficacy and cost and access to facilities [ 5,6]. These
complex barriers may account for the low levels of phys-
ical activity observed after stroke and explain why at
present the most effective methods of engaging stroke
survivors in long-term free-living physical activity and
reducing sedentary behaviour have yet to be ascertained.
Structured exercise is one method of increasing phys-
ical activity and has been shown to lead to short-term
improvements in walking performance [ 7], physical fit-
ness [ 8], metabolic risk factors [ 9] and mood and quality
of life [ 10]. These short-term benefits however do not
appear to be sustained, and the predominant mode of
delivery of structured exercise (face-to-face group work)
presents with numerous barriers to engagement includ-
ing access, cost, sustainability and transport. Arguably,
the lack of long-term benefit of structured exercise is
due to a lack of emphasis on ‘free-living ’behaviour and
self-management during this mode of delivery. This ar-
gument is supported by previous research findings indi-
cating structured exercise sessions may only improve
free-living physical activity levels if delivered alongside
tailored counselling (e.g. gro up/individual counselling
strategies including goal setting, monitoring and re-
view) [ 11]. Interventions that promote supported self-
management, e.g. where individuals are provided with
the information and skills to effectively manage their
long-term condition, can improve long-term outcomes
after stroke [ 12]. Supported self-management may
therefore be a useful mode of delivery for an interven-
tion promoting physical activity and sedentary behav-
iour change after stroke. A number of small feasibility
studies have indeed demonstrated that supported self-management is feasible for t argeting physical activity/
sedentary behaviour after stroke [ 13,14].
It is argued that interventions that target behaviour
change should have a strong theoretical background to
promote change and increase understanding of the de-
terminants of that change. Although complex interven-
tions, few of the existing physical activities and other
lifestyle interventions tested post-stroke are based on
theory or developed using frameworks [ 15,16], which
may be why minimal effects have been observed. Inter-
ventions based on behaviour change theory in other
long-term conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and
lower back pain have shown improvements in long-term
physical activity [ 17,18]. There is a dearth, however, of
research of this type in stroke. Use of theory and frame-
works to develop interventions to target physical activity
and sedentary behaviour after stroke may lead to an in-
creased likelihood of improving long-term behaviour.
Intervention development
Stroke survivor component
Results of a systematic review and in-depth qualitative
study conducted by our study team, and usability/ac-
ceptability testing of prototypes of components of the
intervention, have been used to develop the content of
the stroke survivor intervention.
We have conducted a systematic review of the litera-
ture on interventions targeting long-term physical activ-
ity and sedentary behaviour following stroke [ 19].
Intervention study components were established using
the Template for Intervention Description and Replica-
tion (TIDieR) framework [ 20] and the Behaviour Change
Taxonomy V1 [ 21]. Nine interventions targeting physical
activity were identified by the review, and six of those
were rated as very/quite promising. No interventions
were identified targeting sedentary behaviour. Face-to-
face and telephone supervised support were rated as
promising modes of delivery. Intensity of support pro-
vided did not alter intervention promise. Behaviour
change techniques (BCTs) identified as promising were
action planning, goal setting behaviour, problem solving,
biofeedback, feedback on behaviour, credible source,Moore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 2 of 13
social support, information about health consequences
and information about social-environmental conse-
quences. Only two of the interventions identified from
the included studies were theory-based.
Alongside the review, an in-depth qualitative study has
been conducted [ 22]. The qualitative study identified the
barriers and enablers to participation in physical activity
and reducing sedentary behaviour after stroke from the
perspective of stroke survivors, informal carers and
healthcare professionals (see healthcare professional
intervention development below). The findings were
thematically analysed using the Theoretical Domains
Framework (TDF) [ 23], and this framework was used
to map emergent behaviour change techniques and
theory related to the behaviour of the stroke survi-
vors. Five major themes were identified that were
linked to both consultation behaviour of healthcare
professionals supporting stroke survivors to increase
physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour after
stroke and the views identified by the stroke survivors
and informal carers. These themes were education/
training, information provision, daily activities, re-
sources and confidence.
Findings of the systematic review and the qualitative
study, alongside an assessment of the community
team ’s resources, were combined to provisionally map
the content of the current stroke survivor interven-
tion, in terms of theoretical domains and constructs,
behaviour change techniques and intervention compo-
nents. Following this provisional mapping exercise,
feedback on acceptability and usability of the inter-
vention and intervention tools was gathered from a
series of workshops/interviews/questionnaires with
stroke survivor and infor mal carers and healthcare
professionals (HCPs). The intervention components
were iteratively developed based upon this feedback
to finalise the intervention for this study. The devel-
opment of the intervention will be described in full in
a separate publication.
Healthcare professional training (HCP) programme
The content of the HCP training programme has
been developed in part fro m our qualitative study
where we investigated the perceived barriers and en-
ablers to HCPs supporting people with stroke to in-
crease physical activity and reduce sedentary
behaviour. The study identified the following BCTs
likely to target the behaviour of the HCPs: problem
solving, action planning, monitoring of outcomes of
behaviour without feedback, s ocial support (practical),
social support (emotional), instruction on how to per-
form a behaviour, information about health conse-
quences, salience of consequences, demonstration of
behaviour and credible source. These BCTs have beenincorporated into the HCP training programme which
is underpinned by Social Cognitive Theory [ 24]. The
training programme was piloted on a group of HCPs
who will not be involved in the study to determine
appropriate content and mode of delivery.
Aim
The overall aim of this study is to assess the feasibility,
acceptability and fidelity of a theory- and evidence-based
multifaceted behaviour change intervention targeting
free-living physical activity and sedentary behaviour after
stroke.
Objectives
1. To determine stroke survivor and HCP study
recruitment and attrition rates
2. To report feasibility of intervention delivery (mode,
delivery time, application of intervention
components, safety)
3. To report completeness of baseline and review
descriptive data to determine the feasibility of the
inclusion criteria and of potential outcome
measures
4. To obtain views of stroke survivors on the
acceptability of the intervention and study protocol
5. To assess the fidelity of delivery, receipt and
enactment of the intervention
6. To assess the reaction, attitudes and skills of the
HCPs pre and post training programme
7. To assess the cognitive and behavioural skills of the
HCPs in response to training programme
Methods
Study setting
The study will be set in NHS community stroke services
in the North East of England (a list of study sites is avail-
able at http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN35516780 ).
Study design
This is a multi-centre feasibility and acceptability study.
The multifaceted behaviour change intervention will tar-
get both the free-living physical activity and sedentary
behaviour of stroke survivors, and the consultation be-
haviour of the healthcare professionals supporting stroke
survivors to target these behaviours.
Progression criteria
Progression criteria to the next stage of the study have
been developed in accordance to the traffic light system
described by Avery et al. [ 25]:

Amber —Progression to the next stage of the study is
appropriate with iterative changes to the protocol
Red—Progression to the next stage of the study is not
appropriate
Progression criteria:
Green—The proposed sample size is achieved and
retained, the intervention is considered acceptable and
feasible by healthcare professionals, stroke survivors
with only minor changes are required (e.g. minor
changes to written information content), the study
procedures are considered acceptable and feasible and
at least 85% of outcome data is collected (i.e. case
report form and questionnaire completion).
Amber—At least 14 stroke survivors (based upon
recommendations made by Julios et al. [ 38]) and at
least 7 healthcare professionals were recruited and
retained at follow-up, moderate changes to the inter-
vention are required (e.g. additional time required to
deliver review sessions or additional intervention con-
tent is required), moderate changes to the protocol are
required (e.g. amendments to recruitment strategy and
data collection procedures) and a minimum of 60% of
outcome data is collected.
Red—< 14 stroke survivors and < 7 healthcare
professionals were recruited and retained at follow-up,
significant changes to the intervention are required (e.g.
change in mode of delivery, frequency of sessions and
content of intervention), significant changes to the
protocol are required (e.g. eligibility criteria in order to
achieve sample size, alternative data collection tools/in-
struments) and < 60% of outcome data was collected.
Stroke survivor eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria:
/C15Adult community dwelling stroke survivors
/C15Currently receiving outpatient/community stroke
rehabilitation in the study catchment area
/C15Capacity to provide informed consent and capability
to undertake a supported self-management physical
activity intervention programme (e.g. not requiring
high levels of hands on therapy for function).
/C15Agreement by the therapist and patient that there is
capacity for increased activity / less sedentary

Exclusion criteria:
/C15Contraindications for undertaking physical activity
e.g. presence of unstable heart disease
/C15Advised by GP/Consultant not to undertake physical
activity for health reasonsHealthcare professional eligibility criteria
/C15Currently working as a HCP (e.g. physiotherapists,
occupational therapists) delivering home/community
based stroke rehabilitation
/C15Capacity and willingness to undertake intervention

Sample size
We aim to recruit and retain up to 35 stroke survivors
(in line with standard guidance for feasibility studies
[26]). As this is a feasibility study, a formal sample size
calculation has not been undertaken. The sample size
has been selected to allow adequate testing of the inter-
vention and has been based on local resources. We aim
to recruit up to 12 HCPs to take part in the training
programme and intervention delivery. This sample size
has been decided upon based on feedback from study
sites.
Case ascertainment recruitment and consent
Stroke survivors
Eligible stroke survivors will be identified by a HCP or a
clinical trials officer (CTO) who will explain the nature
of the study and provide the stroke survivor/informal
carer with an information sheet. After allowing sufficient
time for this information to be considered, and an op-
portunity to ask questions, informed written consent will
be obtained from the stroke survivor. Where a stroke
survivor is able to provide consent but is unable to sign
the consent form (e.g. because of weakness of the dom-
inant hand following stroke), consent will be confirmed
orally in the presence of a witness (an individual not
otherwise involved in the study) who will sign the con-
sent form on behalf of the stroke survivor.
The original consent forms will be retained at the
study sites, and a copy will be given to the stroke survi-
vors. A copy of each stroke survivors ’consent form will
be filed in their medical notes at the study sites.
Due to the nature of this study and its small size, we
plan for the information sheet and consent form to be
available only in English. However, interpreters and
translation of written material will be considered should
a potentially eligible stroke survivor require this support
to participate.
Recruitment strategies
Training will be provided to all individuals who can
identify eligible participants for the study. These individ-
uals will be contacted on a regular basis by the study co-
ordination team to promote recruitment.Moore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 4 of 13
Loss of capacity to consent to research during participation
in the study
It is possible that the stroke survivors recruited to this
study may temporarily (e.g. because of intercurrent ill-
ness) or permanently (e.g. because of further stroke) lose
the capacity to consent to this research project. In either
case, it is unlikely that they will be able to continue to
participate in a study which involves self-management. In
the event of likely temporary incapacity, the intervention
will be stopped whilst the participant is unwell, but
restarted on recovery if the participant wishes to con-
tinue. In the event of permanent incapacity, the partici-
pant will be withdrawn from the study. Data collected
prior to withdrawal will be retained and used in the study
analysis as documented in the patient information sheet.
Healthcare professionals
Eligible healthcare professionals (HCPs) will be identi-
fied and approached by the study research team, a dis-
cussion about the study will be held, and the HCPs will
be provided with an information sheet. After allowing
sufficient time for this information to be considered, and
an opportunity to ask questions, the study research team
will obtain written consent from the HCPs.
The original consent forms will be retained at the
study sites, and a copy will be given to the HCPs.
Data collection
After consent, the following data will be collected to
characterise the cohort and inform future studies:
Stroke survivors
Age (years); sex (male/female); pre-morbid walking sta-
tus (independent/walks with an aid); marital status (sin-
gle, married/remarried, separated, widowed, divorced);

current work status (full-time paid, part-time paid,
causal, registered sick/disabled, retired, unemployed, stu-
dent); medical history (diabetes, arthritis etc.); geograph-
ical location (post code) education (year count); date of

Stroke survivor intervention
Procedures
The stroke survivor intervention will target free-living
physical activity and sedentary behaviour through asupported self-management programme. The supported
self-management programme is underpinned by the
Health Belief Model [ 30] and Self-Regulation Theory
[31]. The following 17 behaviour change techniques
(BCTs) have been incorporated into the programme: in-
formation about health consequences, salience of conse-
quences, social support (unspecified), instruction on
how to perform the behaviour, demonstration of the be-
haviour, goal setting (behaviour), problem solving, infor-
mation about antecedents, monitoring of emotional
consequences, information about health consequences,
information about social and environmental conse-
quences, social reward, habit formation, credible source,
action planning, feedback on behaviour and self-
monitoring of behaviour. These BCTs are used to target
each construct of the behaviour change theories/models
and thus aim to operationalise the models in order to
target and change the target behaviours. The interven-
tion will be supported by HCPs. The first face-to-face
session/s the stroke survivor has with the HCP will con-
sist of assessment of psychological well-being, fatigue
and mobility using reliable and valid questionnaires. This
will be followed by identification of preferred behav-
ioural outcome, activity selection, personalised goal set-
ting (behaviour and outcomes), action planning, barrier
identification and coping planning (Fig. 1). The stroke
survivor ’s progress will then be reviewed by the HCP.
The progress review session/s will be timed around the
short-term goals (reviewed within less than three
months) identified by the stroke survivors, e.g. if a goal
is set for three weeks ’time, the review session will be de-
livered three weeks from when the goal was set. The re-
view will focus on progress towards outcomes and
behavioural goals. If goals have been achieved, mainten-
ance or support to further progress goals will be pro-
vided. The overall aim of the intervention is to equip the
stroke survivors with the knowledge and skills to enable
them to self-manage their physical activity and sedentary
behaviour in the long-term.
Materials
All stroke survivors will be provided with a paper-based
workbook. The workbook contains questionnaires on
psychological well-being, fatigue and mobility; informa-
tion on the benefits/potential outcomes of moving more
and sitting less; a list of potential activities, goal setting/
action planning/barrier identification/coping planning
and progress review sheets. Alongside the workbook, a
number of tools will be used on an individual basis in-
cluding pedometers and instructions, information on
apps, physical activity diaries and wall planners and a re-
pository of physical activity resources in the local area.
For example, if a stroke survivor would like to increase
their daily step count, they may be provided with aMoore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 5 of 13
Fig. 1 Stroke survivor intervention programmeMoore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 6 of 13
pedometer to enable self-monitoring of this activity, or if
they wish to break up their sedentary time by standing
every hour, they may be advised on a commercially
available app that provides feedback on sitting time. The
intervention materials that will be used on an individual
basis are listed in Table 1alongside their relationship to
the theoretical constructs of the health behaviour change
models used to underpin the programme and specific
behaviour change techniques.
Mode of delivery
The self-management intervention programme will be
supported by HCPs (e.g. physiotherapists, occupational
therapists, rehab assistants) working in community
stroke teams. The HCPs will all have specialist know-
ledge in community stroke rehabilitation. The first ses-
sion/s will be delivered face-to-face with review sessions
delivered either face-to-face or by telephone.
The intervention programme will be initiated once the
stroke survivor is moving towards supported self-
management and a need to move more and sit less has
been highlighted. The time from stroke will vary
dependent on needs of the stroke survivor/health care
professional ’s opinion on the best timing/availability of
resources. Participants may still be receiving rehabilita-
tion from the community stroke teams at the same time
as the delivery of the intervention.
Dose and duration
Stroke survivors will have contact with the trained HCP
on at least two occasions. There is no upper limit to the
number of HCP supported sessions/time to deliver ses-
sions. The number of sessions will be defined by the
stroke survivors ’support needs/availability of resources.
Tailoring
The intervention programme will be tailored to support
the individual needs of the stroke survivors in relation to
ability/preference and values.
HCP training programme
Procedures
The behaviour of the HCPs in supporting stroke survi-
vors to increase free-living physical activity/reduce sed-
entary behaviour will be targeted by a training
programme consisting of face-to-face training with the
research team, a training workbook and feedback on the
delivery of the intervention.
Materials
The HCPs will be provided with a training workbook
with activities to aid their development of knowledge
and skills to support physical activity/reduce sedentary
behaviour after stroke. The HCPs will also be providedwith a repository of tools which will be used on an indi-
vidual basis with stroke survivors (e.g. stroke survivor
workbook, pedometers, pedometer instructions, discus-
sion cards, physical activity information repository (see
Table 1)).
Mode of delivery
The HCP training programme and fidelity assessment
will be delivered face-to-face, by telephone and via email
contact with members of the research team. The mem-
bers of the research team who will be providing the
training include an HEE/NIHR Clinical Lecturer stroke
physiotherapist (qualified in physiotherapy for over 19
years, specialising in stroke for 14 years, specialising in
stroke physical activity research for 10 years) and two
health psychologists/senior researchers with extensive
expertise in the development, evaluation and optimisa-
tion of lifestyle behavioural interventions for people with
long-term conditions, including delivery of training to
HCPs on the deliver behavioural interventions in clinical
settings.
Dose and duration
The face-to-face training programme will last up to 4 h
and be delivered to each community stroke team indi-
vidually. The training will continue throughout the study
through the use of the training workbook and feedback
from the research team.
Tailoring
The HCP training programme will be tailored to the
needs of each individual HCP through feedback on
intervention delivery.
Outcome assessments
Stroke survivors
At review sessions, the following outcome assessments
will be reassessed: stroke survivor ’s psychological well-
being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale
[29]), fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale [ 28]) and mobil-
ity (Rivermead Mobility Index [ 27]). The number of
times these measures are reassessed will be dependent
on the number of review sessions they undertake with
their healthcare professional.
Acceptability of the study intervention
A questionnaire with a combination of closed and open
questions will be provided to each of the stroke survi-
vors to gather their views of the intervention
programme. Likert scales will be used to explore levels
of agreement with different statements on acceptability
of different aspects of the intervention, e.g. ‘I had good
support from my healthcare professional during my par-
ticipation in the PARAS study ’, Additional comments onMoore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 7 of 13
each statement and views on any aspect of the interven-
tion that could be changed will allow further exploration
of acceptability. Stroke survivors will be provided with a
pre-paid envelope to return their questionnaires to the
study team.
Alongside capturing the views of the stroke survivors
via questionnaire, a sub-sample will be interviewed to
determine acceptability of the intervention programme.
Face-to-face semi-structured interviews of approximately
1 h will be undertaken. An estimated sample of up to 13
stroke survivors will be interviewed in line with pub-
lished guidance for theory-based qualitative interview
studies. Purposive sampling will be used to recruit stroke
survivors who have completed the study. Purposive sam-
pling has been chosen to ensure a maximum variation
sample based on gender, age and stroke-related physical
disability.Potential participants will be invited to consent to be-
ing contacted to be interviewed during their initial con-
sent to the study. Participants selected for interview will
then be contacted either by telephone or by email and
given a brief description of what the interview might ad-
dress, such as how they felt about taking part in the
study, engagement with the supported self-management
programme and any impact they perceive on everyday
activities.
Healthcare professionals
Attitudes skills and reactions to training programme
The attitudes and skills of the HCPs pre- and post-
training will be assessed via a questionnaire developed
specifically for the study. The questionnaire has been
piloted on the HCPs that undertook the pilot testing of
the training programme and refined. A separateTable 1 Intervention materials and their relationship to theoretical constructs and behaviour change techniques

questionnaire will be used to establish HCP reactions to
the training programme.
Acceptability of training programme and study protocol
The HCPs will be invited to attend a 2-h focus group at
the end of the study to discuss their views on the study
protocol. Topics to be covered in the focus group will
include the impact/potential benefits of PARAS, feasibil-
ity of delivering the stroke survivor self-management
programme within usual care, the usability of the inter-
vention tools (e.g. workbook, pedometers and instruc-
tions) and the acceptability of the mode and form of the
stroke survivor intervention delivery.
Cognitive and behavioural skills of the HCPs in response to
training programme
Analysis of audio-recordings of face-to-face and review
sessions with the HCP will be used to assess the cognitive
and behavioural skills of the HCPs delivering the interven-
tion programme. All face-to-face sessions delivered by
HCPs with the stroke survivors will be audio recorded.
Following published guidance, the content of 20 –40% of
these recorded sessions will then be analysed [ 32].
Fidelity of intervention delivery
Fidelity strategies for the design of the study
HCPs involved in the study will have face-to-face train-
ing on the study protocol and the components of the
stroke survivor intervention programme to standardise
the delivery of the intervention. The community stroke
team staffing resources will be mapped out before the
study to ensure resources are adequate to deliver the
intervention programme over the study period. Resource
pre-planning will be undertaken in-case HCPs enrolled
in the study leave during the period of study delivery.
Treatment fidelity strategies for monitoring and improving
HCP training
Standardised face-to-face training will be delivered on
the study protocol and intervention delivery to all HCPs
with direct involvement in the study and to other mem-
bers of the team who may be supporting the study. Dur-
ing the face-to-face HCP training sessions, the skill
acquisition of the HCPs will be assessed to ensure they
have adequate knowledge and skills to deliver the inter-
vention. Those who do not have the adequate skills and
knowledge will receive additional tailored feedback and
training.
Treatment fidelity strategies for monitoring and improving
delivery of stroke survivor intervention
In order to maximise HCPs ’skills delivering the inter-
vention programme, the first two sessions they deliver
with stroke survivors will be audio recorded by theHCPs themselves. The content of these audio-recorded
sessions will be analysed by the research team using a fi-
delity checklist based upon the components of the stroke
survivor intervention. Feedback on the delivery of the
components of the intervention will then be provided by
the research team before the HCPs see more participants.
The HCPs will also have email/telephone contact with the
research team to request further top-up training.
Treatment fidelity strategies for monitoring and improving
receipt of stroke survivor intervention
The understanding and cognitive and behavioural skills of
the stroke survivors undertaking the intervention
programme will be checked by HCPs during face-to-face
sessions by asking stroke survivors to independently
complete a summary sheet of their goals, action and cop-
ing plans after they have completed their workbooks. The
content of this summary sheet, use of intervention tools
and analysis of audio-recorded sessions will also be used
to monitor stroke survivor receipt of the intervention.
Treatment fidelity strategies for monitoring and improving
enactment of stroke survivor skills
Completion of stroke survivor workbooks and use of
intervention programme tools (e.g. physical activity diar-
ies) will be checked at review sessions by HCPs to moni-
tor stroke survivor self-management skills.
Safety
The safety of the intervention will be evaluated by exam-
ining the occurrence of serious adverse events. This
study will only report adverse events which are consid-
ered to be serious.
The standard definitions for serious adverse events will
be used in this study:
Serious adverse event (SAE) : an untoward occurrence that:
/C15Results in death
/C15Is life-threatening (refers to an event in which the
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event;
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically
might have caused death if it were more severe)
/C15Requires hospitalisation, or prolongation of existing
hospitalisation
/C15Results in persistent or significant disability or
incapacity
/C15Is otherwise considered medically significant by the
investigator
Medical judgement will be exercised in deciding
whether an adverse event is serious in other situations.
Important medical events that are not immediately life-
threatening or do not result in death or hospitalisation
but may jeopardise the patient or may requireMoore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 9 of 13
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes
listed in the definition above should also be consid-
ered serious.
Serious adverse events exclude :
/C15Pre-planned hospitalisations
/C15Scheduled treatment for pre-existing conditions.
Capture of potential SAEs will take place at face-to-
face review sessions by including the following questions
in the outcome pro forma: “are there any new medical
problems since the last study visit? ”For any events
which fulfil the criteria to be a SAE and are unreported,
the study SAE form will be completed.
Events considered to be SAEs will subsequently be
documented onto a separate study SAE form, and a
causality and expectedness assessment will be per-
formed. As study investigators or other members of the
research team may become aware of SAEs at times other
than at review assessment appointments, the SAE form
will also be used to directly capture these events.
Initial/provisional SAE reports can be made by tele-
phone or email to the study co-ordinating centre. All
initial/provisional reports must be followed by a fully
completed SAE form. If incomplete information is avail-
able at the time of this initial report, further information
must be provided on a follow-up form as soon as it is
available. All SAEs regardless of causality or expected-
ness will be reported to the Chief Investigator and trial
sponsor (Northumbria NHS Foundation Trust) in line
with local policies. The main REC will be notified of re-
lated and unexpected SAEs within 15 days of the Chief
Investigator becoming aware of the event.
Data analysis
Objective 1
Stroke survivor recruitment rate/month (total per site)
and attrition rates/site and reasons will be described.
HCP recruitment will be described as number of HCPs
recruited compared to number of eligible HCPs in each
team. Non-completion of training programme (e.g. face-
to-face training, workbook, feedback) will be described
as a percentage of non-completers out of the total of
HCPs recruited.
Objective 2
The profession of the HCP delivering the intervention;
the number and time taken (minutes) for face-to-face/
telephone intervention delivery, the application of the
different intervention components applied (e.g. self-
monitoring tools, activity selection) and safety reporting
will be described.Objective 3
Completeness of outcome measure data collection in-
cluding questionnaires will be described (number and
percentage). Summary descriptive statistics (e.g. mean
and standard deviation, median and interquartile range,
95% confidence interval as appropriate) will be used to
describe stroke survivor baseline demographics and psy-
chological well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-
Being Scale), fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale) and mo-
bility (Rivermead Mobility Assessment) at baseline and
review.
Objective 4
Closed questionnaire data from stroke survivors will be
coded and summarised. Open-ended questions have also
been included in order to encourage full, meaningful an-
swers using the participants own words that might po-
tentially offer insights or issues not captured in the
closed questions, yielding more accurate information to
inform future studies. Answers to open questions will be
thematically explored in order to identify, analyse and
report patterns (themes) within the data.
Thematic analysis has been chosen to analyse the
interview data as it is a flexible method that allows
themes to emerge from the data [ 33] and has previously
been used to analyse data following exercise interven-
tions [ 34] and physical rehabilitation following stroke
[35]. This rigorous thematic approach can produce an
insightful analysis that answers particular research ques-
tions [ 33]. Thematic analysis is one of the most com-
monly used methods of analysing qualitative data, as it is
simple, is less time consuming and has a flexible ap-
proach. NVivo software will be used to aid analysis. The
data will be transcribed and then repeatedly read and
coded by two researchers independently within a frame-
work of a priori issues and those identified by stroke
survivors or emerging from the data. Any divergence be-
tween coders will be discussed on an on-going basis to
inform the analysis and resolve differences in the inter-
pretation of data. Analysis will be discussed at regular
meetings of the research team to identify areas for closer
consideration (including negative case analysis) and to
enhance credibility of the thematic framework and inter-
pretation [ 32,36].
Objective 5
Delivery, receipt, enactment and adherence to the inter-
vention by stroke survivors and HCP will be analysed
from completion of face-to-face baseline and review ses-
sions, case report forms, goal summary sheets and audio
recordings of the face-to-face delivery of the interven-
tion. This data will be used to determine the fidelity of
the delivery, receipt, enactment and adherence to the
intervention.Moore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 10 of 13
Objective 6
Closed HCP questionnaire data from pre and post the
training programme will be coded and summarised.
Open-ended questions have also been included in order
to encourage full, meaningful answers using the partici-
pants own words that might potentially offer insights or
issues not captured in the closed questions, yielding
more accurate information to inform future studies. An-
swers to open questions will be thematically explored in
order to identify, analyse and report patterns (themes)
within the data.
Objective 7
Audio recordings of HCP and stroke survivor baseline
or review sessions will be transcribed verbatim and used
alongside HCP recorded written notes on aspects of
intervention delivery. One of the research team trained
in the use of the Behaviour Change Taxonomy Version
1 (BCT v1) [ 21] and an expert coder will independently
code all consultation transcripts and written notes to as-
sess skill acquisition (for feedback purposes) and fidelity
of delivery of each specific behaviour change technique.
A coding frame/fidelity checklist based on the BCT v1
will be used to identify whether each BCT was delivered
as planned. Where discrepancies in coding exist, the re-
searcher and expert coder will meet to resolve these via
discussion. The percentage of positive agreement will be
calculated to assess inter-rater reliability.
Discussion
The main aim of this feasibility study is to determine the
feasibility, acceptability and fidelity of a multifaceted be-
haviour change intervention targeting free-living physical
activity and sedentary behaviour in community dwelling
adult stroke survivors. The most effective methods for
improving long-term physical activity and reducing sed-
entary behaviour after stroke have yet to be ascertained.
Theory-informed interventions are shown to improve
physical activity in other long-term conditions and may
be effective post-stroke. The intervention tested within
this study has been developed with the use of theory and
behavioural mapping, increasing potential for efficacy.
The content of stroke rehabilitation interventions is
often poorly described [ 37]. Content of this current
intervention has been described using the TIDieR frame-
work [ 20] which will enable further testing of the com-
ponents of the intervention and translation of future
results. Previous stroke rehabilitation research has been
limited by a lack of measurement of fidelity, e.g. whether
interventions are delivered as intended. In this study,
there is a focus on ensuring and measuring fidelity,
which will enable understanding of whether of interven-
tion delivery and inform future knowledge in this fieldand the iterative development of the intervention to en-
able future testing.
General information
Study withdrawal
No specific study withdrawal criteria have been set. Par-
ticipants may withdraw from the study at any time for
any reason. Should a HCP or stroke survivor decide to
withdraw from the study, a reason for withdrawal will be
sought but participants can chose to withdraw without
providing an explanation. If a stroke survivor decides to
withdraw, it will not affect the normal care they receive
either now or in the future. Data collected prior to with-
drawal will be used in the study analysis unless consent
for this is specifically withdrawn.
Clinical teams, local treatment providers or investiga-
tors may also withdraw stroke survivors from the study
at any time if they feel it is no longer in the participant ’s
interest to continue, for example, because of intercurrent
illness.
Lone worker policy
Study team and intervention providers will follow the
relevant Trust and/or Newcastle University lone workers
policy when collecting study data and providing therapy
in people ’s homes.
Confidentiality
Personal data will be regarded as strictly confidential.
The study will comply with the Data Protection Act,
2018, General Data Protection Regulations and Caldicott
Principles. All study records will be kept at study sites
and/or Newcastle University with restricted access. All
trial documentation will be retained for future audit in
line with the sponsor policies. Participants will not be
identified in any report or publication arising from this
research. Any feedback comments or quotes will be
anonymised.
Indemnity
NHS Trusts participating in the study have liability for
clinical negligence that harms individuals toward whom
they have a duty of care. NHS indemnity covers NHS
staff and academic staff with honorary contracts con-
ducting the trial for potential liability in respect of negli-
gent harm arising from the conduct of the study.
Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust is
Sponsor, and through the Sponsor, NHS indemnity is
provided in respect of potential liability and negligent
harm arising from study management. Indemnity in re-
spect of potential liability arising from negligent harm
related to study design is provided by NHS schemes for
those protocol authors who have their substantive con-
tracts of employment with the NHS and by NewcastleMoore et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:58 Page 11 of 13
University Insurance schemes for those protocol au-
thors who have their substantive contract of employ-
ment with the university. This is a non-commercial
study, and there are no arrangements for non-
negligent compensation.
Data management
A web-based data entry tool will be developed and ad-
ministered by the research team for the study. A data-
base manager will monitor data quality under
supervision of the project team.
Data sharing
We will share anonymised data (referenced only with
study number) with approved collaborators both nation-
ally and internationally (inside and outside of the EU)
for scientifically sound, peer-reviewed studies. Data shar-
ing offers a more open approach which allows us to
maximise the impact of the study for the health and
well-being of the population.
Data sharing will be managed by our data manage-
ment committee according to the following procedures:
1. Collaborators interested in accessing data from the
study will send the data management committee an
expression of interest, for example, using data
request from or via research platforms data portals.
2. The committee will then review the data request. If
required, the data management committee may
request changes to the proposed study by
collaborators. The data management committee
may then approve or reject the proposed study.
3. A data use agreement will be drafted and signed by
both parties.
4. As agreed by the data managing committee and
collaborators, and according to signed data
agreement forms, anonymised data will be
transferred to the collaborators.
Data will be securely transferred to collaborators. Data
will be securely stored by collaborators for a fixed dur-
ation, as stated in the signed data use agreement. Only
anonymous and unidentifiable data will be sent.
Auditing
Progress and quality of trial delivery via fidelity checks
will be monitored prospectively by the project manage-
ment group at scheduled meetings. As this is a feasibility
study, it will not be audited by an independent auditing
company.Dissemination of results
The data will be the property of the Chief Investigator
and Co-Investigator(s). Publication will be the responsi-
bility of the Chief Investigator.
The study will be presented at national and inter-
national conferences and reported in peer-reviewed jour-
nals. Reports will be written for the study sponsor and
regulatory bodies. A summary of the results will be sent
to study participants. Anonymised data will be provided
to research databases as requested (e.g. the Cochrane
Collaboration, the Virtual International Stroke Trials
Archive (VISTA) to enable future meta-analyses).
