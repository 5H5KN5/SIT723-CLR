Abstract
Background: Children born preterm may display cognitive, learning, and behaviour difficulties as they grow up. In
particular, very premature birth (gestation age between 28 and less than 32 weeks) may put infants at increased risk
of intellectual deficits and attention deficit disorder. Evidence suggests that the basis of these problems may lie in
difficulties in the development of executive functions. One of the earliest executive functions to emerge around 1
year of age is the ability to control attention. An eye-tracking-based cognitive training programme to support this
emerging ability, the Attention Control Training (ACT), has been developed and tested with typically developing
infants. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using the ACT with healthy very preterm (VP) infants
when they are 12 months of age (corrected age). The ACT has the potential to address the need for supporting
emerging cognitive abilities of VP infants with an early intervention, which may capitalise on infants ’neural plasticity.
Methods/design: The feasibility study is designed to investigate whether it is possible to recruit and retain VP infants
and their families in a randomised trial that compares attention and social attention of trained infants against those
that are exposed to a control procedure. Feasibility issues include the referral/recruitment pathway, attendance, and
engagement with testing and training sessions, completion of tasks, retention in the study, acceptability of outcome
measures, quality of data collected (particularly, eye-tracking data). The results of the study will inform the development
of a larger randomised trial.
Discussion: Several lines of evidence emphasise the need to support emerging cognitive and learning abilities of
preterm infants using early interventions. However, early interventions with preterm infants, and particularly very
preterm ones, face difficulties in recruiting and retaining participants. These problems are also augmented by the
health vulnerability of this population. This feasibility study will provide the basis for informing the implementation of
an early cognitive intervention for very preterm infants.

Background
The number of surviving children born premature has
increased across many countries around the world [ 9,
10]. Advances in obstetric care since the early 1990s
have also contributed to diminishing risks for disability
of children born preterm, e.g. reduction in the preva-
lence of cerebral palsy [ 61]. Nonetheless, premature
birth is still associated with increased risk for intellectual
deficits [ 15,16,48,67] and poorer school attainment [ 4].
Several studies suggest that this risk increases with lower
gestational age [ 65]. In particular, newborns born very
premature (VP), i.e. those born between 28 and less than
32 weeks gestation age, are at increased risk of signifi-
cant intellectual deficits [ 8,16,30,33,40,45,60], learn-
ing difficulties [ 2,39], attention problems [ 2,23,64],
problem behaviours [ 6,12,19,42], and developmental
disorders such as attention deficit with hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD) [ 13,14,26,28,46].
Several studies have suggested that the bases of these
problems may lie in anomalies in the way children born
VP regulate and control the acquisition of information
[37,38,41]. These problems may be evident from an
early age. For example, Rose and colleagues [ 52,53,55,
56] conducted several studies on a cohort of preterm in-
fants weighing less than 1750 g at birth and with average
gestational age 29 weeks: they reported that preterm in-
fants displayed less efficient and more immature pat-
terns of attention in standardised tasks that required
effortful processing of stimuli rather than just orienting
responses. Downes and colleagues [ 21] showed that 1-
year-old VP infants were less capable of allocating
sufficient attention to targets during a visual attention
task. Sun and others [ 64] also reported that at 8 months
(corrected age), VP infants displayed more significant
problems in inhibiting attention to irrelevant informa-
tion or distracters compared with full-term controls dur-
ing an A-not-B task. Collectively, these findings suggest
that VP infants display problems allocating and control-
ling attention according to task demands.
VP infants ’difficulties in attention control may repre-
sent early signs of deficits in processes that are funda-
mental to the development of learning skills. Attention
control refers to the ability to select actively what to pay
attention to and what to ignore. This ability starts to
emerge by 1 year of age in typically developing infants
[18,20]. The emergence of attention control represents
a shift from exogenously controlled attention systems
whereby responses are determined purely by the external
environment towards an increased role for endogenous
and volitional processes in which responses are deter-
mined by factors intrinsic to the person attending. With
increasing age, attention is deployed more flexibly in
order to process task-relevant information and inhibit ir-
relevant information. Attention control is thereforeconsidered to play a foundational role in the develop-
ment of later-emerging executive functions (EFs), such
as planning and cognitive flexibility [ 5,32]. EFs are, in
turn, thought to be important for facilitating learning
and behaviour regulation, and anomalies in their devel-
opment may impact on the development of other cogni-
tive abilities [ 16]: the latter study indicated that EFs
mediate the association between premature birth and
poorer intellectual abilities of children born VP when
compared with full-term children. Studies by Rose et al.
also suggested that EFs can explain the association be-
tween prematurity and lower educational attainment of
children born preterm [ 57,58]. In conclusion, early-
appearing problems in the control of attention in chil-
dren born very preterm may generate a cascade of ef-
fects, which involve deficits in cognitive flexibility in
toddlerhood, poorer EFs [ 72], and ultimately deficits in
cognitive abilities and lower educational attainment.
According to this developmental view, early interven-
tions play a key role in targeting and addressing prob-
lems and deficits in foundational abilities, such as
attention control. Indeed, evidence from systematic re-
views suggests cognitive training programmes produce
greater effects when delivered at younger ages [ 73]. The
reason for this may lie in the greater plasticity of neural
networks that control cognitive skills: intervening early
may help support the development of key skills before
deficits become entrenched [ 73]. Early interventions tar-
geted at key early-emerging skills can provide at-risk in-
fants with the necessary building blocks for later
attainments [ 11,34,72].
A new intervention to target infants ’attention control
has been developed, dubbed the Attention Control Train-
ing (ACT) [ 7,71]. This intervention uses computer inter-
faces that monitor infants ’direction of gaze through eye-
tracking: this allows the computer to generate interactive
presentations whereby visual stimuli on the screen change
and vary in response to infants ’gaze direction. Interactive
presentations provide motivating rewards (e.g. animations
with sounds) when infants control attention in ways that
fulfil the varying demands of the task at hand. For ex-
ample, in some tasks, infants receive the reward if they
maintain attention on an object, suppressing the tendency
to look at distracters that appear on the screen. In a differ-
ent task set, infants have instead to scan a series of targets
on the screen in order to detect a pre-specified target ob-
ject. The intervention is innovative because it engages
young infants using age-appropriate tasks. Furthermore,
the adaptive procedures allow tailoring the training to
each infant ’s initial skill set.
The ACT has been trialled with typically developing
children [ 71] and has provided evidence of transfer of ef-
fects to attention skills (e.g. sustained attention) [ 7,71,
74], short-term memory [ 7,71], and naturalistic socialPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:17 Page 2 of 11
attention tasks [ 25], thus demonstrating generalizability
and persisting effects in the short term [ 7,71]. However,
before the intervention can be tested with VP infants, a
series of processes need to be investigated to underpin
its implementation in a full-scale randomised trial. These
processes are the subject of the study presented here.
Aims of the study
Different types of early developmental intervention pro-
grammes exist that aim to improve cognitive abilities of
preterm infants [ 62]. These interventions mostly focus
on the home environment, parent-infant relationships,
and parenting skills, but few focus on infant develop-
ment alone. Computerised cognitive training pro-
grammes have been tested among pre- and school-age
children who were born before term [ 1,49], but not with
younger preterm children. Furthermore, few studies have
reported on the use of eye-tracking methods to examine
preterm infants ’attention abilities [ 21,36,59,66].
Therefore, more research is necessary to establish the
feasibility of delivering a computerised cognitive training
programme to VP infants, which relies on eye-tracking
technology.
The study described here tests the feasibility of a ran-
domised trial investigating the effectiveness of the ACT
for infants born very preterm. The study aims to deter-
mine recruitment strategies for the population of inter-
est; the process of randomisation; procedures to mask
allocation status to the parents and the assessors; the ac-
ceptability of the intervention, and the baseline and out-
come measures; participating infants ’completion of the
training and baseline/outcome measures; quality of in-
formation collected from participating infants.
Research questions
Primary question:
(a) Is the study feasible? Is it possible to recruit and
retain families of infants born very preterm into the
programme and collect baseline and outcome
measures, over a period of five consecutive weeks
when the child is 12 months (corrected age)?
Recruitment and retention criteria used to assess
the success of the feasibility study are stated in the
statistical analyses section of this manuscript.
Secondary questions:
(b) Is the programme acceptable to participating
parents and infants?
(c) Are the proposed baseline and outcome measures
acceptable to participating parents and infants?
(d) Do VP infants engage with the training/control
procedures?(e) Do VP infants engage with the baseline/outcome
tasks and do these measures provide reliable data?
Methods
Trial design
The study involves a feasibility randomised trial whereby
eligible infants are allocated with 1:1 ratio to either the
Attention Control Training (ACT) or a control proced-
ure. Families and infants in both arms of the study are
invited to take part in five sessions for five consecutive
weeks, matching the protocol used in previous studies
[31]. Researchers attempt to schedule the first session
around the time the infant is 12 months (corrected age);
however, inclusion criteria allow the infant to be be-
tween 11 and 13 months (corrected age) at the time of
the first appointment. The first session involves a base-
line assessment of attention and cognitive skills carried
out by a blinded assessor (see “Blinding ”section). If the
infant is still in a calm and alert state, the infant also
completes a training or control session within this first
weekly session; however, if the infant is not calm and
alert, the first training or control session is scheduled for
the following weekly session. Study sessions in weeks 2,
3, and 4 involve the delivery of the training or the con-
trol procedure. In week 5 (post-test), infants complete
the same battery of tasks used in week 1 (pre-test). To
ensure that the experimenters administering the pre-
post tests are blinded to the infant ’s group allocation,
separate researchers are used for the training/control
visits (Experimenter 1) and for the pre-/post-test ses-
sions (Experimenter 2). The infant ’s group allocation
(trained/control) is determined by opening a sealed en-
velope at the end of the pre-test session. In Fig. 1, we re-
port the enrolment, interventions, and assessments
schedule following the SPIRIT template.
The study protocol initially stipulated to run all the
study sessions in a dedicated room in the premises of
the local collaborating charity (Protocol version 12,
dated 05 January 2018). However, after initial feedback
from parents and discussion within the study steering
group, we changed the protocol to allow parents to opt
to conduct the training or control sessions in their own
house (Protocol version 14, dated 16 November 2018).
This change in the procedure was agreed in order to fa-
cilitate the participation of parents, by removing the
need for weekly travel to the premises of the charity.
The pre- and post-test sessions still take place in the
dedicated room within the local charity, because the
tasks administered during these sessions require more
space and equipment (i.e. a table and cameras mounted
on both sides of the room). To ensure that training or
control sessions are comparable when delivered in a
dedicated room in the charity premises and at home, the
same set-up will be used in both situations. In particular,Perra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:17 Page 3 of 11
the participants will sit inside a cubic photo light tent,
which avoids visual distractions and sudden changes in
light conditions. Researchers will also strive to obtain
parents ’and families ’collaboration in minimising any
other potential source of distraction, e.g. loud or sudden
noises. However, differences across the two settings will
be monitored and investigated across the study.
Participants
Eligibility criteria are infants born very preterm (gesta-
tional age 28 to less than 32 weeks); residing in Northern
Ireland; age 12 months (+/ −1 month) at the start of the
study, corrected for prematurity. Exclusion criteria: Sig-
nificant visual and/or hearing disabilities; congenital
anomalies that may impact on their cognitive and
sensory-motor development; a diagnosis of cerebral
palsy; taking part in a trial (or have recently taken part
in a trial) which may interfere with this study (e.g. by af-
fecting concentration abilities or representing a signifi-
cant burden for the family).
Participants are identified by collaborating neonatology
practitioners in hospitals within the Belfast, South
Eastern, and Northern Trust in Northern Ireland. Practi-
tioners act as gatekeepers and ensure that information
on the study is passed to families of infants that are eli-
gible to take part and do not meet any exclusion criter-
ion. Interested parents contact the research team to
receive more details about the study and decide whether
to take part or not. If parents agree to take part, theresearch team document their consent in writing and
agree an appointment. Furthermore, the local charity for
families of premature children passes the information on
the study to eligible parents, who can decide to contact
the research team if they are interested. Parents who re-
ceive information about the study from the charity are
asked to consult with one of the collaborating neonatol-
ogists to ensure their child does not meet any exclusion
criterion.
Interventions
Infants in the ACT intervention watch interactive stim-
uli presentations which are contingent on infants ’direc-
tion of gaze. An eye-tracker records the infant ’s eye
movements in real-time. Interactive presentations pro-
vide animations in response to the infant ’s gaze in ways
that meet pre-specified criteria. We used training tasks
to train abilities to search for a target among distracters
(three games —‘Stars ’,‘Usual Suspects ’, and ‘Disengage-
ment ’); short-term memory of objects embedded in
scenes ( ‘Puzzle Memory ’,‘Windows ’,‘Tausendfuss ’, and
‘Three Little Maids ’); maintaining a goal ( ‘Butterfly ’, and
‘FlyMe ’). Further details on all of these tasks are pro-
vided in Additional file 2. In each session, tasks are
evenly spread across the three categories. Researchers
are instructed to attempt to present each game for at
least 240 s without interruptions; however, training
games are interrupted if the child becomes fussy or irrit-
able, and fails to engage with the task for a continuousFig. 1 Schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments. *The first session of the intervention/control procedure is scheduled to take part as
soon as the pre-test is completedPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:17 Page 4 of 11
period of over 30 s. A suggested random order of the
tasks is generated by the computer script in each train-
ing session. The researcher also assesses if the infant is
still in calm and alert status before commencing any
new task, and stops the sessions if the infant becomes
restless or drowsy. A video camera mounted on the
screen captures the infant ’s face: this recording is used
in order to check the quality of data produced and to
complement potential loss of data.
The control procedure involves presenting cartoons
on a screen while infants ’gaze direction is recorded
using the same eye-tracker and camera. As with the
training tasks, the infant is seated throughout on the
parent ’s lap. The crucial difference is that the stimuli
presented are not interactive, thus do not change contin-
gently with infants ’gaze direction. To ensure presenta-
tion times in the control procedure are similar in length
to those in the intervention group, infants in the control
group are matched infant-by-infant and visit-by-visit
with participants in the ACT training. Thus, the car-
toons displayed to a control child will follow the same
schedule produced by the corresponding yoked child in
the intervention group. In this way, the cartoons dis-
played to both groups will be the same, but the pivotal
difference is that the display is generated contingently
on infants ’gaze behaviour during treatment, and it is in-
stead generated according to a pre-set schedule for those
in the control group.
Whether the training or control procedure takes place
in the dedicated room in the local charity or in the
family ’s home, we will use the same equipment consist-
ing of a computer screen, a Tobii X-60 eye-tracker,
Matlab scripts to control the visual display and record
data provided by the eye-tracker, and a webcam to rec-
ord the infants ’visual behaviour during the procedure.
In both settings (local charity or family ’s home), in order
to avoid interference from light sources and to minimise
distraction, the computer screen will be mounted inside
a photographer ’s white light tent, while the infant will sit
on a parent ’s lap on a chair inside this tent. To avoid
distraction produced by noise, when visiting the family ’s
house, the researcher will ask the parent to identify
times and dates whereby the house is quiet and will ask
collaboration from parents in ensuring that possible
sources of noise (e.g. appliances) are excluded.
Outcome measures
Primary outcomes
(a) Recruitment as a percentage of the eligible families
approached who agreed to take part in the study
and were randomised, and retention, defined as the
percentage of randomised participants for whom
data are available at baseline and post-test.Secondary outcomes
(b) Percentage of training/control sessions attended by
infants, sessions completed by infants, duration of
tasks completed during these sessions.
(c) Percentage and type of tasks for which data are
available at post-test
(d) Quality of eye-tracker data collected during baseline
and post-test assessments, such as the number of
usable fragments and the degree of consistency in
the reported position of gaze between recorded
samples, and consistency of post-test outcomes with
expected trends (e.g. general increase in disengage-
ment abilities across study arms)
Furthermore, to assess the feasibility of the study, we
also decided to collect feedback from participating par-
ents using a short questionnaire and conducting a semi-
structured interview. In the latter, parents are asked
about difficulties and obstacles to taking part and
remaining in the study, as well as their motivations in
taking part, and their experience of the study.
Baseline and post-test assessments
We devised a battery of tests and tools to be adminis-
tered before and after the completion of training/control
sessions: these provide information about the infants ’
general cognitive and motor development, their atten-
tion, and their social cognition abilities. The presenta-
tion of tasks takes place in four pseudo-randomised
sequences, counterbalanced between infants and across
baseline and post-test within each infant. At baseline,
parents provide socio-demographic information about
them (e.g. educational attainment) and their child (e.g.
birth weight), see Fig. 1.
General cognitive and sensory-motor development
We administered the Mullen Scales of Early Learning
[43]. These scales provide individual scores on different
domains (e.g. Expressive language; Fine motor abilities;
etc.).
Computer-based measures of attention
These include widely used measures of sustained atten-
tion, visual recognition memory, disengagement, and in-
formation processing. These are described in more detail
in Additional file 1.
Naturalistic attention tasks
We used the Orientation Task from the Lab-Tab [ 29,
50], as well as a semi-structured interaction between
parent and infant. In the latter, four age-appropriate at-
tractive toys are placed in front of the infant and the
parent sits across the table. Parents are instructed to playPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:17 Page 5 of 11
with the infant as they “would normally at home ”. The
latter parent-infant play episodes last four minutes.
Social attention and cognition
We administered the Gaze Following, Object Spectacle,
and Book Presentation task from the Early Social Com-
munication Scales (ESCS) [ 44]. These tasks provide in-
formation on the infant ’s ability to share attention with
other people, and her communicative abilities.
Temperament
To assess temperamental measures, we administer the
Task Orienting and the Attractive Toy Placed in a Box
tasks from the Lab-Tab [ 29,50]. The former also pro-
vides measures on infants ’focused attention, as well as
temperamental measures relating to dimensions such as
duration of orienting. The latter provides measures relat-
ing to behaviour regulation. Furthermore, parents are
also asked to complete the very-short form of the Infant
Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ) [ 51].
Sample size
The sample size has been determined using power calcu-
lations based on a confidence interval approach de-
scribed by Cocks and Torgerson [ 17]. Based on a
Cochrane review of interventions involving infancy out-
comes of preterm infants [ 62], we estimated that the
standard effect size for a cognitive training programme
like ours is likely to be 0.40. The confidence interval ap-
proach prescribes a pilot sample size that can produce a
one-sided 80% confidence interval upper limit which ex-
cludes the plausible a-priori effect size (0.40), assuming
the training effect from the pilot was zero (no difference)
or less (favouring the controls). In such a scenario, the
sample size required would be 18 participants. We aim
to recruit 20 infants in order to allow 10% drop out rate
from the study.
Randomisation
Sequence generation
The random allocation sequence was generated in two
blocks ( n= 10 each) using randomly generated numbers
from the uniform distribution. These were generated
using Stata 13 [ 63], and constraining the intervention/
control ratio to be 1:1.
Allocation concealment mechanism
The main researcher conducting the trial received the al-
location in a sealed opaque envelope when a new partici-
pant is due to commence testing. The researcher has
been instructed to open the envelope only when the
child finishes the baseline assessment.Implementation
The sequence generation was produced by the first author
and project PI. Participants are enrolled by the Experi-
menter 1 (training/control implementation). Experimenter
1 does not administer the baseline and post-test outcome
measures, but during these, he attends to the cameras re-
cording task administration. In doing so, he controls the
camera remotely through a laptop while sitting outside
the testing room.
Blinding
To ensure blinding, Experimenter 2 does not contribute
to the administration of the training/control procedures,
nor is he involved in coding or data analyses concerning
training and control procedures. We inform parents that
we will not tell them in which group their child is allo-
cated. Parents are thus intended to remain blind to
group allocation. Parents, however, keep their infant on
their lap while the infant takes part in the training or
control procedure, which raises the possibility that par-
ents may identify whether the games are part of the
training (i.e. they are responding in real time to the in-
fant ’s gaze) or the control procedure (i.e. games are not
interactive). Based on experience from previous studies,
we estimate it is unlikely parents will recognise the in-
fant ’s group allocation. Furthermore, while keeping the
infant on their lap parents cannot monitor the infants ’
gaze direction (i.e. they may not have key information to
detect whether the games are interactive or not). How-
ever, at the end of the study, we ask parents to indicate
whether they thought they had recognised to which
study arm the child had been allocated, and in which
study arm they thought their child was.
Ethical approval
The study has been reviewed and approved by the
Health and Social Care Research Ethics Committee A
(HSC REC A), REC reference: 18/NI/0010; IRAS project
ID: 237537.
Governance and management
The study is sponsored by Queen ’s University Belfast
(QUB). QUB Research Governance Office audits re-
search studies to make sure that they are being carried
out in accordance with the highest standards of integrity.
A trial steering group had been set up to meet at least
four times during the running of the study. The group
remits are to discuss progress of the trial, issues and
problems arising, suggestions and solutions to these is-
sues. The Trial Steering Group is made up of the study
team members, as well as independent practitioners, and
a parent representative.
Data are anonymised by assigning study IDs to each
child and family taking part in the study. AllPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:17 Page 6 of 11
questionnaires, coded data, and eye-tracking data are
stored using these IDs. Anonymised data will be shared
with researchers at QUB and University of East London
(UEL) for research purposes. Video and audio records
contain information that enables identification of the
participants: for these reasons, these are stored on separ-
ate systems and are not going to be shared with re-
searchers outside the sponsoring institution. In
accordance with QUB Research Governance Framework,
the information and the data collected will be stored for
5 years after study publication. The study was approved
and started before the General Data and Privacy Regula-
tion (GDPR) Act 2018 became effective. However, the
procedures follow the spirit of the regulation (e.g. partic-
ipants were informed about their right to delete infor-
mation collected).
Audio recordings from parental interviews will be
transcribed, and the original audio-recordings deleted
once verbatim transcriptions have been carried out and
checked. Researchers will delete from the transcripts any
reference to sensitive information or information that
may identify the parents or the children (e.g. parental
place of employment). Parents agree in writing or in a
recorded statement to the use of quotations from the
interviews.
A distress protocol had been submitted and approved
together with the Ethics application to the HSC REC.
This protocol set clear criteria for interrupting singular
sessions, as well as the study, if distress or other adverse
circumstances involving the child, parents, or the family
were reported by parents, or if distress and other adverse
circumstances were noted by researchers during the
study. The distress protocol also specified procedures to
follow up or escalate concerns about participants ’health
and wellbeing.
Statistical analysis
Blinding of assessors was considered pivotal for this
feasibility study. Statistical analyses are going to be con-
ducted by research team members OP and SW, who will
not be blind to trial arm. However, scripts of analyses
and, whenever possible, data on which analyses are
based will be made available to ensure transparency.
Primary outcomes
(a) Recruitment: a key outcome is how many parents
have been contacted by gatekeepers (practitioners
and the local charity), and the number of families
that eventually agree to take part. Retention: we are
going to consider the percentage of infants that
complete at least 50% of the pre-test tasks and the
percentage of infants that complete at least 50% of
the post-test tasks to estimate the proportion ofparticipants that dropped out. We also plan to carry
out these comparisons between the intervention
and control group. Finally, we are also going to in-
vestigate associations between drop out and infants ’
and family characteristics such as infant ’s gender,
gestation age, admission to neonatal intensive care
unit (NICU), family ’s Social Economic Status (SES),
e.g. differential rates of dropping out between males
and females, or infants of different gestation age.
Secondary outcomes
(b) Percentage of training/control sessions attended and
completed by infants: we will collect information on
the number of sessions not attended (e.g. cancelled)
by infants and examine differences across the
intervention and control groups. We shall also
examine other factors that may be predictive of
non-attendance (e.g. infants ’gestational age). We
also consider information regarding completion of
sessions, defining a session as being completed if in-
fants engaged without interruptions for the required
time (240 s) with at least two tasks, irrespective of
whether these were training or control tasks. Fi-
nally, we are going to investigate the number of
tasks completed, defined as the display of the task
for at least 240 s, the type of tasks completed (e.g.
goal maintenance), the total duration of tasks ad-
ministered to infants, and the average duration of
tasks per session. We will test for differences in
these outcomes by study group and by infants ’char-
acteristics (e.g. gestational age).
(c) Data available at post-test: we will investigate the
number and type of post-test tasks completed by in-
fants and compare these between study groups and
infants ’characteristics, e.g. gestational age and sex.
We will also investigate differences in completion
across tasks type in these categories: screen-based
eye-tracking tasks; social attention tasks (ESCS
tasks); Lab-Tab tasks; Mullen scales.
(d) Quality of eye-tracker data collected: we will calcu-
late the duration (in seconds) of usable fragments of
eye-tracking data obtained during randomly sam-
pled tasks in the pre- and post-assessment, and dur-
ing training/control sessions. These analyses will
provide an estimate of the robustness of recording
because ‘void ’fragments can signal issues capturing
the infant ’s eye gaze [ 75]. We will also investigate
the consistency with which the gaze position re-
ported by the eye tracker is consistent between
samples, randomly selected from pre/post sessions

compared with estimate from other studies involv-
ing typically developing infants, and we will also in-
vestigate differences across settings (e.g. charity vs.
family home), as well associations between out-
comes and infants ’characteristics. Consistency of
post-test outcomes with expected trends: We will
consider results in outcomes across the two groups
and test if infants show expected trends in key tasks.
In particular, we expect infants to display trends to-
wards improved attention abilities in the screen-
based eye-tracking tasks at post-test, as well as
trends towards improved social attention and
orienting in the ESCS social attention tasks, and the
orienting task of the Lab-Tab. We will also compare
differences across study groups in order to estimate
effect size associated with the intervention.
Qualitative outcomes
Follow-up interviews with parents that have taken part
in the study will be transcribed verbatim and analysed
using thematic analysis to identify common themes re-
lated by participating parents. This analysis will be con-
ducted by the study PI, while the RA will review a
sample of the transcripts independently to identify
themes. The two study team members will discuss dis-
agreements and review their thematic analysis in light of
this discussion.
Discussion
Importance of the study
The evidence of persisting intellectual and educational
attainment deficits in children born VP [ 6,15,16]i n
spite of improvements in their care highlights the need
for interventions that may enhance key foundational
abilities at an early age. Over many countries, there is a
recognition and acknowledgment of the role and cost-
effectiveness of early interventions, and strategies for the
provision of early interventions have been advocated by
legislative bodies, e.g. the UK Parliament [ 35]. The ACT
meets this need for early interventions, targets key skills
that are related to the development of cognitive flexibil-
ity and Executive Functions, and does so at an age
whereby attention control abilities are just emerging and
may thus be particularly plastic and amenable to change
[73]. The delivery of the ACT to infants born VP may be
particularly apposite because VP infants are known to be
at risk of deficits in control of attention [ 2,23,64], EFs
[45], cognitive and intellectual abilities [ 15,16]. Re-
searchers recognise that there are wide individual differ-
ences in the developmental trajectories of VP infants,
and many studies have also highlighted the resilience of
many VP infants exposed to aversive events such as long
stays in the NICU, and exposure to painful procedures
[22,24,54,70]. We want to emphasise that the ACT isnot to be considered a remedial intervention for infants
with recognised deficits, but rather a universal interven-
tion that can help strengthen and reinforce key executive
skills when they start to emerge. Nonetheless, infants
born VP may particularly benefit from this intervention,
as it may nourish abilities that some VP infants may find
particularly challenging to master.
Before seeking funding for a full trial, it is important
to ensure that the research processes and procedures of
the ACT are safe, feasible, and acceptable to families of
and infants born VP, and indicate whether or not a full
trial is justified. This pilot trial is designed to address
these issues.
Determining the feasibility of a randomised controlled
trial
Infants born VP are a relatively small sub-group within
the overall infant population: in England and Wales, they
represent approximately 1% of live births every year, but
this still represents a large number of infants affected by
VP birth, e.g. over 5500 in England and Wales [ 47].
These infants are often exposed to aversive events (e.g.
long stay in the NICU) and may have complex needs,
which affect the life and well-being of parents and fam-
ilies [ 3,27].
The recruitment of this population in experimental
studies and trials may thus present a series of challenges
concerning identifying and contacting families affected
by preterm birth, communicating in sensitive manners,
challenges in participation and retention. This pilot
study will help us identify optimum recruitment proce-
dures, the likely time it will take to recruit a sufficiently
powered sample size, what the barriers and facilitators of
study participation might be, and whether the interven-
tion is acceptable to participants and their families. We
also aim to test the quality of information collected
using eye-trackers and measures of infants ’engagement
in the tasks, to ensure that equipment is suitable for re-
cording the attention of VP infants, and that the proce-
dures we plan to use are adequate and apposite for this
population.
Risks and benefits for participants
There will be small benefits for the families involved
whether they receive the programme or not. They will
experience five research visits, with a small monetary
recompense, will observe the infant engaging in a num-
ber of naturalistic tasks (e.g. gaze following) that will
help parents recognise their infant ’s abilities, and will be
able to talk about their child ’s development: Experience
in other studies suggests these opportunities are valued
by families [ 68,69].
The screening process by gatekeepers will also ensure
that families of infants with complex or seriousPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:17 Page 8 of 11
conditions will not be inconvenienced with requests to
take part in the study. However, shall any concern about
the health and safety of an infant or a family arise, this
will be discussed with the collaborating consultant pae-
diatricians. If paediatricians endorse these concerns, we
will follow a protocol of actions, appropriate for the type
of concern (e.g. discuss the concern with the family and
suggest a consultation with a GP or a paediatrician). In-
formation to this effect is included in the Patient Infor-
mation Sheet.
Dissemination
We will make public the results of the study via an open
access journal publication, a final technical report and
briefing for the funders of the study, and a plain English
summary which we will send to all participants.
