ABSTRACT
Much of the global burden of non-communicable disease is caused by
unhealthy behaviours that individuals enact even when informed of their
health-harming consequences. A key insight is that these behaviours arenot predominantly driven by deliberative conscious decisions, but occur
directly in response to environmental cues and without necessary
representation of their consequences. Consequently, interventions that
target non-conscious rather than conscious processes to change health
behaviour may have signi ﬁcant potential, but this important premise
remains largely untested. This is in part due to the lack of a practicable
conceptual framework that can be applied to better describe and assess
these interventions. We propose a framework for describing or categorising
interventions to change health behaviour by the degree to which their
effects may be considered non-conscious. Potential practical issues withapplying such a framework are discussed, as are the implications for further
research to inform the testing and development of interventions. A
pragmatic means of conceptualising interventions targeted at non-
conscious processes is a necessary prelude to testing the potency of such
interventions. This can ultimately inform the development of interventionswith the potential to shape healthier behaviours across populations.ARTICLE HISTORY

The growing global burden of non-communicable disease (principally cancers, diabetes and cardio-
vascular disease) is largely determined by behaviours that are potentially modiﬁ able, namely exces-
sive consumption of food and alcohol, physical inactivity and smoking (WHO, 2014 ). Furthermore,
these behaviours are socially patterned, being more common amongst those who are most sociallydeprived, thereby contributing to the increased morbidity and premature mortality observed in these
groups (Stringhini et al., 2010 ). Yet such behaviours and their patterns have proven remarkably resist-
ant to attempts to change them. Identifying interventions that are effective in changing health-
related behaviours across populations and thereby reduce health inequalities arising from the
social patterning of such behaviours is one of the foremost global public health challenges. It has
been proposed that interventions that target non-conscious processes may prove effective in chan-ging behaviour in populations, and potentially more so than interventions that principally engage
conscious deliberative processes (Marteau, Hollands, & Fletcher, 2012 ). This important premise
remains largely untested, however, hampered by the lack of a practicable conceptual framework
necessary for characterising the processes by which interventions elicit behavioural responses. In

this review, we outline a pragmatic approach to enable researchers to better describe the relative
extent to which any given intervention to change health-related behaviours targets non-consciousprocesses, and thus begin to address these important issues.
Historically, the principal focus of non-regulatory approaches to changing health-related behav-
iour has been on information-based interventions (Marteau, Hollands, & Kelly, 2015 ). These interven-
tions typically provide a persuasive message comprising verbal or numerical information to prompt
individuals on the value or consequences of engaging in a given behaviour, leading to the formation
of intentions to change that behaviour. They may also teach the skills necessary for change. Suchapproaches can provide the same generalised information to all members of a given population,
for example, by using mass media to disseminate informative anti-smoking messages (Bala,
Strzeszynski, Topor-Madry, & Cahill, 2013 ). Alternatively, they may use biological or genetic test infor-
mation to provide personalised information to individuals about health risks attributable to dietary
intake or physical inactivity. There is, however, an increasing recognition that many of these interven-
tions are of limited effectiveness (Marteau et al., 2012 ). Whilst this observation is in accordance with
evidence of limited intentional control of behaviour (Webb &Sheeran, 2006 ), it is important to clarify
that this is not to dismiss the potential effectiveness of all interventions that purposefully engageconscious processes via, for example, providing persuasive information or facilitating problemsolving or planning (including deliberative efforts to automate future responses to internal and
external cues). Rather than being inherently ineffective, it may instead be that the content of such
interventions is often inappropriately conceived or directed. Indeed, there is evidence for the effec-tiveness of a range of such interventions including smoking cessation programmes (West, May, West,
Croghan, & McEwen, 2013 ), weight-loss programmes (Jebb et al., 2011 ) and implementation-inten-
tion interventions (Bélanger-Gravel, Godin, & Amireault, 2013 ) including when these are scaled up
to population-level application (Neter, Stein, Barnett-Griness, Rennert, & Hagoel, 2014 ). However,
the limited effectiveness that is often observed, particularly for predominantly information-based
interventions, should prompt us to explore the potential of an additional approach, one thatentails interventions that do not focus on engaging conscious deliberation via explicit communi-
cation, but instead target non-conscious processes occurring outside awareness.
Many processes determining our behaviour are non-conscious (Bargh & Morsella, 2008 ;B a r g h ,
Schwader, Hailey, Dyer, & Boothby, 2012 ). It follows that interventions that target non-conscious pro-
cesses may therefore prove effective in changing behaviour in populations (Marteau et al., 2012 ). Of
particular interest are interventions that do not require individual delivery, targeting or instruction
by those intervening, as these have the greatest potential to be readily scalable to the population
level. Interventions meeting these criteria typically comprise changes to characteristics of the physical
and social environments that surround us and shape our behaviour (Swinburn et al., 2011 ). Such inter-
ventions can be broadly classi ﬁed as those that alter (i) the properties or (ii) the placement of external
stimuli (see a recent typology of micro-environmental or choice architecture interventions (Hollandset al., 2013 ) and Supplemental material for further details and examples). These interventions do not
require complex information to be understood in order for a behavioural response to be generated.
Furthermore, as they are less dependent on levels of literacy, numeracy and self-regulatory capabilities,
they may be particularly effective in those who are most socially deprived and who can be disadvan-taged in such domains (Mof ﬁtt et al., 2011 ; Spears, 2010 ). Reﬂecting these considerations, there is
growing interest across the ﬁelds of psychology, behavioural economics, neuroscience, public health
and policy in the potency of external stimuli to change behaviour outside awareness (Cohen &Babey, 2012 ; Dolan, Hallsworth, Halpern, King, & Vlaev, 2010 ; Felsen, Castelo, & Reiner, 2013 ; Lisman
&S t e r n b e r g , 2013 ;M a r t e a ue ta l . , 2012 ; Sheeran, Gollwitzer, & Bargh, 2013 ; Thaler & Sunstein, 2008 ).
These ideas have also gained traction within government and policy circles worldwide (Nesterak, 2014 ).
Whilst prior literature has examined the processes by which health-related behaviour may be
inﬂuenced outside of awareness (Cohen & Babey, 2012 ; Sheeran et al., 2013 ), despite high levels of
interest and optimism, robust evidence of effectiveness of interventions that target non-consciousprocesses
remains scarce. There are reports of interventions that impact on behaviour despite382 G. J. HOLLANDS ET AL.
ﬁnding that participants are typically unaware of being exposed to the intervention (van Kleef, Otten,
& van Trijp, 2012 ; Maas, de Ridder, de Vet, & de Wit, 2012 ; Papies & Hamstra, 2010 ). There are also a
small number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventions that could reasonably be
assumed to operate at least partly outside of conscious awareness, such as altering food portion,
package and tableware size (Hollands et al., 2015 ), that indicate important effects on behaviour.
However, as was observed in Hollands et al. ’s systematic review, participant awareness in intervention
studies is often not assessed, or is minimally reported. Research efforts towards testing the importantcentral premise –that interventions targeting non-conscious processes may have signi ﬁcant poten-
tial–and ultimately identifying and developing effective interventions, are hampered by the lack of a
practicable conceptual framework necessary for coherent research characterising their effects. Toexamine whether interventions can reasonably be characterised as having potential to in ﬂuence
behaviour via targeting non-conscious processes, we ﬁrst explore what is meant by conscious and
non-conscious activation of behaviour by external cues or stimuli.
Conceptualising conscious and non-conscious activation of behaviour
Determining whether any given behaviour can be described as conscious is a complex task. Each behav-iour and its activation is a composite of many conscious and non-conscious processes and may arise from
an array of internal and external cues and their interaction. This is further complicated by the fact that
behaviours can be analysed and described at a number of levels and so the admixture of consciousand non-conscious processing may be different depending on the level at which the analysis is
applied. For example, if I talk about a bicycle ride, my description may invoke the non-conscious processes
that keep me balanced and moving, the conscious processes of deliberating where I am going and why,
and a host of processes in between that may each in themselves be described at different levels. My route
may be a well-known one that I may cycle automatically without deliberation, or it may be a novel one
laboriously followed with a map. To take another example, of eating some potato chips, I may be aware ofthe endpoint of actually eating the chips, but not necessarily aware of why I am eating the chips. Rather
than being a result of a premeditated decision, the behaviour may have been activated by an environ-
mental cue such as a television advertisement, the in ﬂuence of which I was unaware (Harris, Bargh, &
Brownell, 2009 ). The key point here, and one to which we will return, is that, when we identify processes
as conscious or non-conscious, we must be clear about the scale and level of analysis we are employing.We propose that by applying a consistent framework we can ﬁnd an appropriate level to describe and
analyse behaviours as a prelude to developing interventions aimed at changing them. The distinction
between conscious and non-conscious behaviour may be informative in the context of developing
ways to change population health behaviour because it re ﬂects the degree of conscious deliberation
that is required for a behaviour to be activated by a given intervention.
Conceptions of conscious and non-conscious behaviour can be framed in relation to dualisms that
are present across the behavioural and brain sciences. Dual-process or dual-systems models ofbehaviour have received increasing attention in recent years within behavioural science and psychol-
ogy (Hofmann, Friese, & Wiers, 2008 ; Sherman, Gawronski, & Trope, 2014 ; Strack & Deutsch, 2004 ).
Such models propose two broad systems of human behaviour, one comprising actions towards ident-
iﬁed goals resulting from re ﬂective, reasoned processes, and the other comprising actions resulting
from automatic associative processes cued by external stimuli. A number of terms has been appliedto denote these two systems. We use the terms re ﬂective and automatic to represent multiple,
nuanced underlying components and conceptualisations. Although it is convenient to characterise
reﬂective behaviour as conscious and automatic as non-conscious, Bargh ( 1994 ) and Moors and
De Houwer ( 2006 ) deconstruct the meaning of automaticity, highlighting that this relates to multiple
components or processes with varying degrees of overlap, each of which has been used to charac-terise automaticity. It is therefore more precise to consider these components individually. We focus
here on the conscious –nonconscious dimension, which is widely invoked on its own terms and is also
used to represent broader conceptions of automaticity in the behaviour change literature.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 383
Within the behavioural neuroscience literature, a distinction is commonly made between habitual
and goal-directed behaviour. Simply put, habitual responding entails an action prompted by the
presence of a stimulus without the necessary representation of the goal of that action, the latter rep-
resentation being a characteristic of goal-directed behaviour (see Gardner ( 2015 ) for a review of the
habits literature as applied to health-related behaviour). This distinction provides a ﬂexible, though
simple, means of describing behaviours, but the question of how these phenomena relate to a dis-tinction between conscious and non-conscious behaviour is complex. Lisman and Sternberg ( 2013 )
proposed that non-conscious behaviour equates to habitual behaviour, and conscious behaviour to
non-habitual behaviour. Given that goal-directed behaviour is essentially characterised by the rep-
resentation of a goal, this is a plausible idea. However, we suggest that, for practical purposes, it is
more useful to consider both habitual and non-habitual behaviour as having the potential to be con-scious or non-conscious depending upon the level of analysis. This is because, as already mentioned,
any given behaviour comprises an admixture of conscious and non-conscious processes that may
differ depending on the level at which analysis is applied. We provide here only a simpli ﬁed overview
of the literature on non-conscious processes and automaticity. More extensive literature reviews are
available (Bargh et al., 2012 ; Moors & De Houwer, 2006 ).
Key considerations in describing non-conscious activation of behaviour
Figure 1 highlights two key premises that underpin our framework and merit further consideration: (i)
A comprehensive analysis of a behaviour requires that we consider the enacted behaviour alongsidethe processes by which it is activated; and (ii) many levels of analysis are possible when describing a
behaviour and awareness of the activation of behaviour.
A comprehensive analysis of a behaviour requires that we consider the enacted behaviour
alongside the processes by which it is activated
It has been suggested that if a person is able to report on an action then this constitutes conscious
behaviour. Lisman and Sternberg ( 2013 ) apply the example of advertising, which, while it may trigger
Figure 1. Conscious and non-conscious processes underlying behavioural activation cued by exposure to an external stimulus. The
black path represents behavioural activation that would be regarded as conscious, whereby the actor is aware of a causal link between
a stimulus and a behaviour. The grey paths represent a behaviour that would be regarded as non-conscious, whereby the actor isunaware of the causal link between a stimulus and a behaviour. The green –red shading represents the conscious –nonconscious spec-
trum, whereby awareness of each element is of a degree on a spectrum depending on the level at which awareness is analysed. Note:

non-conscious processes, ultimately leads to conscious performance of a behaviour, such as buying a
chocolate bar. They state that, ‘The fact that conscious decisions can be inﬂ uenced by unconscious
factors does not alter the fact that the decision itself is reportable and therefore conscious ’(p. 278) .
Whilst this criterion may appear initially reasonable and straightforward to apply, adopting it wouldnonetheless place considerable constraints on a comprehensive understanding of health-relatedbehaviours. By focusing on the ultimate behavioural endpoint (such as buying a chocolate bar)
and omitting consideration of the multiple processes that activated and shaped this behaviour, we
sidestep important complexities and limit our ability to describe and explain it. We suggest that amore detailed examination of the processes by which a behaviour is activated can be helpful and
so we should instead aim to consider the intermediary processes by which the cueing stimulus acti-
vates the response. Within this context, we propose, consistent with the position taken by otherauthors (Chartrand, 2005 ; Nisbett & Wilson, 1977 ), that conscious activation of behaviour comprises
awareness of the causal link between the stimulus that activates the behavioural response and theperformance of the behaviour. However, formation of such a causal inference that there was aneffect of the stimulus on one ’s behaviour, logically requires awareness of both the external stimulus
and of the ensuing behaviour. Therefore, the degree to which behaviour activated by external stimulimight be considered non-conscious is a function of the extent to which the actor is aware of the fol-lowing elements:
(a) the external stimulus (i.e., the intervention);
(b) the ensuing behaviour; and
(c) the causal link between (a) the stimulus and (b) the behaviour
It is important to emphasise that our focus is on the activation of behaviour by external stimuli
because our aim is to characterise differential awareness of the effects of external stimuli, in the
form of interventions to change behaviour. For the sake of parsimony, we are also invoking asingle external stimulus, but of course acknowledge that multiple external and also internal stimuli
will often continue to be important determinants of behaviour irrespective of any intervention. Fur-
thermore, people vary in terms of the stimuli to which they expose themselves and the effectsthereof.
Whilst the theoretical position outlined here is not novel, our speci ﬁc focus, upon translating these
concepts for application to interventions to change health-related behaviour, is novel. We will nowdiscuss each of the three elements above in turn. As illustration, throughout the following discussion
we will draw on a set of exemplar intervention types (derived from Hollands et al., 2013 ) that have
been implemented to shape healthier dietary behaviour: altering portion sizes of food (sizing)
(Rolls, Roe, & Meengs, 2010 ); exposing shoppers to recipe posters to prime dieting goals (priming)
(Papies & Hamstra, 2010 ); placing foods nearer or further away from people (proximity) (Maas
et al., 2012 ); and altering the relative availability of healthy and unhealthy food options (availability)
(van Kleef et al., 2012 ). These interventions are appropriate case studies as they have the potential to
activate behaviour via non-conscious processes. They do not rely on conscious deliberation of explicitinformation and it is therefore less likely that the actor will be cognizant of, or reﬂ ect upon, their
intended effects. This is demonstrated in the cited examples of each, in which participant awareness
of the intervention to which they have been exposed has been assessed, revealing most to be
unaware.
Awareness of the external stimulus (i.e., the intervention)
Dehaene, Changeux, Naccache, Sackur, and Sergent ( 2006 ) discuss the characteristics of conscious
processing with a focus on the perception of visual stimuli. But how does this translate to interven-tions that occur in real-world environments, where there may be a complex range of stimuli (not onlyvisual) and differing across a range of properties or characteristics? One possibility is to de ﬁneHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 385
consciousness in relation to simple awareness of the presence versus absence of the external stimu-
lus. In the case of portion sizing interventions, this would mean awareness of the presence of the foodportion that was subject to manipulation. Because nearly all instances of naturally occurring stimuli
are supraliminal (Bargh & Morsella, 2008 ), this places a relatively low threshold on the assessment of
consciousness. As such, we would be highly likely to ascribe awareness of the stimulus if we used
such a criterion. A more stringent test and a more appropriate threshold when thinking about chan-
ging behaviour is awareness of the speci ﬁc properties or characteristics of the stimulus that comprise
the intervention manipulation (the more detailed this is able to be, the more it is suggestive of
increasing awareness). These levels of awareness can be determined on their own (absolute)
terms, or in relative terms, as a difference relative to a prior exposure to the same or similar stimulus
or environment. Which is more appropriate would depend on the nature of the implementation. Inthe example of portion size, this would mean awareness of the size or volume of the food portion (i.e.,
absolute), or awareness of a difference in size or volume of the food portion relative to a prior
exposure in a comparable context (i.e., relative). For the previously cited example of priming, thismay mean awareness of the poster or the recipe content therein; and for proximity and availability,
respectively, the notable closeness or distance of the food or the notably large or small number of
healthy or unhealthy food options that are available.
Awareness of the ensuing behaviour
An actor ’s awareness of a given behaviour (e.g., eating food) can be characterised at a variety of
levels. First, he or she may have no awareness that they have acted at all (e.g., not aware that theyare eating or have eaten food subsequent to exposure to the stimulus). Second, he or she may be
aware that they have acted in some way, but with limited awareness of the properties or character-
istics of this behaviour. For example, they may be aware of eating or having eaten food but not awareof the amount of food consumed. Third, an actor may possess a higher level of awareness, which
could be demonstrated either in absolute or relative terms. For example, they may be aware of
eating a speci ﬁed amount of food (absolute), or of eating a higher, similar or lower amount of
food relative to typical or previous behaviour in a comparable context (relative).
A problem with trying to ascribe consciousness to a behaviour, even using a well-operationalised
approach, is the complexity mentioned previously: any behaviour inevitably arises from a compositeof a multitude of smaller, intermediary behaviours and processes, for which we could potentially
assess awareness. For example, in the context of research on portion sizing interventions, likely out-
comes of interest would be total consumption of, or total energy intake from, the food product whichis subject to the intervention. However, if we wished, we could instead choose to focus on the speed
of an individual ’sﬁrst approach to the food, or the amount they consumed in their ﬁrst bite –and
assess awareness correspondingly. In short, there comes a level of description where aspects of
even the most re ﬂective of behaviours fall below the level of awareness. A parallel can be drawn
to the habits literature where it has been proposed that for complex behaviours it may be helpfulto distinguish between the processes of (habitual) initiation of a behaviour and its performance(Gardner, 2015 ). However, what might seem a profound problem of characterising behaviour is of
lesser concern in the context of a pragmatic approach to changing behaviour. Whilst, at a ﬁne
enough grain, any behaviour might be dismantled into non-conscious parts, the pertinent questionis whether the level of analysis is relevant to the changes in behaviour we aim to elicit, before con-
sidering the question of awareness at that level. When working within the context of a behaviour
change intervention we may often choose a higher-level behavioural endpoint, such as a selectionor consumption behaviour, given the ultimate goal of demonstrating a change in behaviour that
has some wider signi ﬁcance for health outcomes. There may also be contexts where a focus on a
lower-level behaviour is equally or more relevant to the changes in behaviour that the intervention
is intended to elicit, such as reducing bite size or speed of chewing (Shah et al., 2014 ).386 G. J. HOLLANDS ET AL.
Awareness of the causal link between (a) the stimulus and (b) the behaviour
This criterion ultimately determines whether we can ascribe conscious activation of behaviour, but as
illustrated in Figure 1 , awareness of the causal link is logically predicated on an actor having some
awareness of both the stimulus (the intervention) and of their resulting behaviour. If awareness ofeither of these components is absent then awareness of the causal link is inevitably also absent,
and this would then be regarded as an example of non-conscious activation of behaviour. If aware-
ness of both is present, but the actor remains unaware of a causal link, then again this would beregarded as representing non-conscious activation of the behaviour. As such, non-conscious behav-
iour in this context is characterised by a lack of awareness of the effect of external stimuli on one ’s
behaviour (Bargh & Morsella, 2008 ). Conversely, if individuals are aware of all three elements then this
would be regarded as an example of conscious activation of behaviour. Applying the example ofportion sizing, an awareness of the causal link, and thus conscious activation of behaviour, would
comprise a recognition that the characteristics of the behaviour (e.g., ﬁve sandwiches were eaten,
or more sandwiches were eaten than usual) were inﬂ uenced by the characteristics of the stimulus
(e.g., the large number of sandwiches that was presented for consumption). Awareness is,however, a matter of degree and varies along a spectrum, meaning that individuals may recognisea causal link but misjudge its extent. As we now discuss, characterising the level of awareness also
depends on the level of analysis that we apply.
Many levels of analysis are possible when describing a behaviour and awareness of the
activation of behaviour
Lisman and Sternberg ( 2013 ) propose that if a decision about a behaviour is reportable then it is con-
scious. This raises the question as to what precisely is meant by a ‘decision ’that is to be reported.
Applying simple distinctions between awareness and a lack thereof may be relatively straightforward
in a laboratory context, where awareness of a behaviour may refer to simply eating or not eating a
food item presented to a participant where there are relatively few competing behavioural (or phys-
ical/spatial) possibilities. But if we take the example of buying a bottle of branded beer from a super-market, how does Lisman and Sternberg ’s concept of conscious behaviour apply? Awareness of the
behavioural decision is an ambiguous criterion because it could be applied at numerous levels ofspeci ﬁcity or levels of explanation. It could mean awareness of several possible decisions, ranging
from non-speci ﬁc (such as the decision to take any amount of any alcoholic beverage from the
shelf) to speci ﬁc (such as the decision to take four bottles of a speci ﬁc brand of bottled beer and
none of any other brand). Alternatively, it could refer to different stages of activation of the behaviour,ranging from awareness of a prior realisation of wanting to purchase some beer at the supermarket,
to awareness of placing bottles of beer in a shopping basket. Does awareness at any one of these
points count as an equivalent demonstration of conscious activation of behaviour? We wouldargue that it does not and that it may be instructive to think in more nuanced terms about the
nature of awareness of any given behaviour.
This example illustrates what we call the issue of speci ﬁcity: awareness of behaviour and of its acti-
vation is a concept always understood relative to the level of speci ﬁcity that is applied by the asses-
sor. When we assess the degree of awareness of the activation of a behaviour, the more speci ﬁcw e
are in our assessment of what constitutes awareness (i.e., the more detailed the knowledge we
require from our interrogation), the less likely it is that the actor will be able to demonstrate aware-
ness of the process, and thus the more likely we are to attribute any observed behaviour to a process
of non-conscious activation. For example, if a person is presented with a large bowl of chocolatepudding, we might reasonably expect them to be aware whether they had consumed any of the
pudding or not, but may not expect them to be aware of the precise absolute amount that they
had consumed. Consequently, an inability to distinguish the amount being consumed may not rep-resent a fundamental lack of awareness, but instead represent the dif ﬁculty of reporting such detailedHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 387
objective information. We might, however, reasonably expect an adequate assessment of relative
consumption, such as of having eating more or less pudding than usual.
In line with our prior comments concerning identifying an appropriate behavioural outcome, in
assessing awareness of the activation of behaviour there is a need to apply a degree of speci ﬁcity
that is consistent with the aim of the speci ﬁed intervention. Furthermore, if any assessment is to
have the potential to aid in characterising behaviour by degree, it must possess the potential to
detect differences in responses and so the threshold for ascribing awareness must not be set inap-
propriately low or high.
Applying a framework of conscious and non-conscious activation of behaviour by
an intervention
InFigure 2 , we present a framework applied to the context of interventions to change behaviour. This
highlights that if the criteria we have outlined are consistently applied to such interventions, we can
distinguish between relatively non-conscious and relatively conscious behaviour activation. It also
indicates that these are broad and not discrete categories and awareness is most meaningfully
viewed as occurring on a continuum.
Previously in this article, we assumed, for brevity and simplicity, an idealised situation in which we
are able to assess the outlined criteria directly. Our concern, however, is with characterising interven-tions to change behaviour in real-world situations. We now consider how we may be able to charac-terise the extent to which any given intervention targets non-conscious processes, or in other words,
is less reliant on engaging conscious deliberative processes. We can do this by applying the frame-
work in Figure 2 to the effects of interventions. Awareness of the activation of behaviour can be
Figure 2. A framework of conscious and non-conscious activation of behaviour by an intervention. Conscious activation of behav-
iour (green) is characterised by awareness of both the intervention and the behavioural response. Non-conscious activation of
behaviour (red) is characterised by a lack of awareness of the intervention and/or the behavioural response. Moderately conscious
activation of behaviour (light green) indicates an assumed spectrum. For the purposes of this ﬁgure, we assume that, where there is
some awareness of both intervention and behaviour components, an awareness of the causal link between these has also been
generated to a varying degree (should this be absent, then the behaviour would inevitably be regarded as non-conscious).388 G. J. HOLLANDS ET AL.
assessed using various measurement approaches, although explicit measurement has been the pre-
dominant approach.
Assessment of awareness of behaviour activation
Within the context of interventions or manipulations to change behaviour, the typical approach tooperationalising the assessment of awareness of behaviour activation is to ask individuals directly.
We regard self-report suggesting that an individual is unaware of the causal link between interven-
tion stimuli and subsequent behaviour as a minimum necessary requirement for demonstrating that
an intervention targets non-conscious processes. A funnel debrie ﬁng procedure may be employed by
which individuals are asked increasingly speci ﬁc questions about the nature of the intervention they
have been exposed to and its potential for inﬂ uencing their behaviour (Bargh & Chartrand, 2000 ). Par-
ticipants may initially be asked if they are able to determine the broad purpose or hypotheses of the
study, assuming that there is adequate blinding to this incorporated within the study design. Suchgeneral questions (e.g., ‘What do you think the study was about? What do you think the aim of
the research is? ’) are relevant in characterising the degree to which an intervention targets conscious
engagement with its content. They allow assessment of whether participants recognise any potentiallink between the intervention and behaviour, for themselves or others, even if the intervention is inef-
fective. We may then move on to more speci ﬁc questions to determine whether they noticed the
characteristics of the stimuli that were presented, and whether they were aware of any link
between these stimuli and their subsequent behaviour (e.g., ‘Did you notice anything special or
notable about the (room/shop/restaurant/meal options/food you were given)? ’;‘Did anything (you
were asked to do/you noticed in the room) affect your actions or how you were thinking? ’) whilst
being careful not to direct people towards speci ﬁc responses. For these types of more speci ﬁc ques-
tions, we would anticipate a lesser degree of awareness to be exhibited for a similarly effective inter-vention that targets non-conscious (versus conscious) processes.
If we again consider the example of portion sizing interventions, several researchers have assessed
awareness in such a way. For example, Rolls et al. ( 2010 ) assigned participants to a series of differently
sized portions of broccoli (as part of a meal) to see how this affected consumption. The researcherssubsequently enquired about participants ’opinions of the purpose of the study but also whether
they noticed any differences between the different experimental sessions. Despite this study employ-ing a within-subjects design, making it more likely that the manipulated characteristics of the stimu-lus (i.e., the size of the portion) would be more salient, participants typically remained unaware of the
purpose of the study and often of the experimental manipulation of portion size. In a priming inter-
vention, Papies and Hamstra ( 2010 ) exposed participants to either a recipe poster displayed at a store
entrance –an intervention designed to elicit dieting goals, or no poster –the control condition. When
participants were asked whether they had noticed anything special about the store, fewer than 20%of participants in the intervention condition mentioned the recipe poster. This provides some supportfor characterising these interventions as having the potential to activate behaviour via non-conscious
processes, as participants did not typically notice the experimental manipulations.
As highlighted in recent reviews and commentaries (Doyen, Klein, Simons, & Cleeremans, 2014 ;
Hagger, Rebar, Mullan, Lipp, & Chatzisarantis, 2015 ; Labrecque & Wood, 2015 ; Newell & Shanks,
2014 ), assessing awareness of cognitive and behavioural processes via self-report has limitations.
Doyen et al. ( 2014 ) identify a number of concerns, suggesting that verbal reports are inadequate
for claiming processing without awareness. Our position on the use of such measures is as follows.First, we do not think that use of a self-report measure is invalidated because it fails to meet criteria
proposed as necessary for documenting the complete absence of awareness. As these authors them-selves assert, the need for documenting the complete absence of awareness depends on the claims
that the researcher wishes to make. In research on behavioural interventions, we are ultimately inter-
ested in describing and developing more effective ways of changing behaviour. Understanding theunderlying mechanisms is important in so far as it enables us to develop better interventions, but it isHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 389
fundamentally a means to an end. We have no requirement to validate a theoretical position by de ﬁ-
nitively demonstrating the activation of non-conscious or conscious processes. Instead, by imple-
menting the basic framework that we outline, we may be able to better characterise different
types of interventions, by highlighting the variability in the degree to which they target non-con-
scious processes or to which they require conscious deliberation or engagement to change behav-iour (at least as far as this is able to be assessed). This is the potential value that such an approach
offers, even if this value largely remains to be demonstrated through the accretion of relevant data.
Second, we acknowledge that people are often unable (and at times unwilling) to report accu-
rately on their own behaviour, and more so when a response is required after the fact (Nisbett &Wilson, 1977 ). Due to cognitive limitations and thus an inability to report relevant information, con-
scious report is imperfect and often rather limited in what it can capture. This means that we should
not rely on detailed accounts of underlying mechanisms beyond the basic criteria we have outlined
and, in determining and interpreting those criteria, apply a critical and cautious perspective. Even
imperfect measures should, however, have the potential to fulﬁ l the promise of the outlined
approach, in at least enabling a broad mapping of relative levels of awareness between different
interventions.
Supplementary methods for assessing awareness
There may, however, be supplementary methods to self-report assessment that allow us to further
corroborate or better characterise such an assessment. Bargh and Chartrand ( 2000 ) highlight the
role of follow-up tests in corroborating the ﬁndings of funnel debrie ﬁng procedures, such as to deter-
mine actors ’ability to recognise and discriminate the stimuli they have been exposed to. It is not,
however, immediately obvious to us how such approaches could be applied consistently to tests
of interventions to change behaviour in real-world settings, where interventions may comprise a
complex range of stimuli that differ across a range of properties. Alternative supplementaryapproaches may therefore be more adaptable.
First, we may employ implicit measures of cognition to assess the activation of cue-behaviour
associative networks (Hagger et al., 2015 ). Instead of direct assessment via intentional report (e.g.,
questionnaire items), such measures assess processing via indirect assessment, such as response
time tasks, that does not require awareness of the meaning of the response or the mental content
that is being assessed (Nosek, Hawkins, & Frazier, 2011 ). If we observe that (a) such measures are
affected by an intervention and this mediates the effect of the intervention on the behaviour; and
(b) that measures that rely on direct reportability (such as questionnaire measures of reward value
or behavioural intentions (Conroy, Hyde, Doerksen, & Ribeiro, 2010 ) are unaffected and do not
mediate behavioural effects, then this provides additional detail for characterising the intervention
as principally targeting non-conscious processes (though we cannot assume that the measures
were comprehensive). This approach has been little applied to the study of interventions that arescalable to population-level, which is unsurprising given the practical challenges with gathering
data on complex measures in a group intervention setting. It has, however, been used in controlled
laboratory studies of behaviour change interventions (Hollands, Prestwich, & Marteau, 2011 ).
A second possible supplementary approach is to test whether, in the delivery of an intervention,
adding explicit instructions to participants to encourage conscious deliberation on the mechanism ofthe intervention impacts on its effectiveness. For example, in a recent study (Cavanagh, Vartanian,Herman, & Polivy, 2014 ), participants were instructed regarding the way in which external inﬂ uences,
such as portion size, may affect food intake, including how to reduce such in ﬂuences on their behav-
iour. This did not alter the effect of portion sizing on behaviour, that is, those given this instruction ateas much when provided with a larger portion as those not provided with this instruction. The fact that
following the provision of such information, participants did not moderate the effect of the interven-
tion is compatible with the effect of portion size on behaviour not being reliant on conscious engage-ment. This approach requires us to also apply the aforementioned explicit self-report approach;390 G. J. HOLLANDS ET AL.
otherwise a possible interpretation is that the intervention is already working as a result of conscious
engagement and so the additional explicit instructions will not affect this. A third, related approach isto test whether restricting one ’s ability to consciously engage with an intervention, for example, by
simultaneously imposing a cognitive load, moderates the effect of an intervention. We would predictthat if the effect of the intervention does not require conscious activation, then imposing a cognitiveload would not signi ﬁcantly moderate it. However, we note that imposition of cognitive load may
affect cognitive control of behaviour as well as conscious engagement. Further work is thereforeneeded to describe more precisely the cognitive resources needed for non-conscious behaviouralcontrol to ensure that these are not restricted in any attempt to restrict conscious behavioural control.
At present, it may be challenging to apply anything other than basic self-report measures of
awareness to interventions implemented in the ﬁeld, but we have aimed to highlight that there is
value in applying pragmatic although imperfect methods. We do not, however, intend to deny the
impetus to develop better approaches and more robust measures –challenges laid down should
be regarded as a valuable catalyst towards increased precision and rigour in our methods, our report-
ing and in our theoretical interpretation. An important avenue of research will be the continued
development of studies, observational and experimental, in more controlled environments that
seek to examine, with temporal and spatial precision, the processes by which external cues areencountered and responded to. Such studies may valuably inform our understanding of both the
mechanics (in terms of intervention and participant characteristics) of existing, conceptually similar
interventions that are currently being applied in less controlled, real-world settings and also aid inthe development of new interventions.
Next steps
The key implication of the framework we have outlined is that those wanting to test and developinterventions that target non-conscious processes should consider attempting to characterise suchprocesses by collecting primary data from intervention studies, alongside undertaking conceptual
development work relating to methods of assessment and the mechanisms that they putatively rep-
resent. In this article, we propose what we regard to be a practicable starting point for this. We shouldalso focus on improving our ability to characterise the nature and active components of interventions
to change behaviour, in order to gain insight into why some interventions may elicit or require
greater or lesser degrees of conscious engagement than others. As such, ongoing efforts toimprove our understanding of the content, mechanisms and means of delivery of behaviour
change interventions (Hollands et al., 2013 ; Michie et al., 2013 ) are complementary and should
occur in parallel.
The central premise here is that interventions that rely less on conscious engagement and instead
target non-conscious processes have signiﬁ cant potential for changing behaviour in populations.
Increasing efforts to assess awareness would enable opportunities to begin testing this important
premise which, if con ﬁrmed, would enhance the identi ﬁcation and development of effective inter-
ventions. First, at the aggregate, between-study level, it would enable the effectiveness of interven-tions in changing behaviour to be examined in relation to the degree to which they target non-conscious processes to change behaviour. Given suf ﬁcient primary data collection and accompany-
ing conceptual developments, such an analysis could ultimately be possible within a systematicreview framework. Second, at the more detailed within-study level, analysis could be conducted toexamine the relationship between level of awareness of the intervention mechanism and its
effects on behaviour. This would enable us to determine, for example, how the effect on behaviour
differs between subgroups who are categorised as aware versus unaware (and whether the interven-tion remains effective when awareness is controlled for) and how closely subjective awareness of
behaviour change maps on to actually observed changes in behaviour.
Finally, it would enable another key hypothesis (outlined in more detail elsewhere (Marteau et al.,
2015 )) to be examined, concerning the potential for behaviour change interventions to reduce healthHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 391
inequalities arising from the higher rates of unhealthier behaviours in more deprived groups. Because
interventions that are less reliant on conscious, re ﬂective engagement depend less on levels of lit-
eracy, numeracy and executive function, they may be particularly effective in those who are most
socially and materially deprived and who can be disadvantaged in such domains. For example,
there is evidence that person-centred behaviour change interventions that involve individual-leveleducation and counselling may widen inequalities, whilst those that instead alter the environments
that people are exposed to do not appear to do so (McGill et al., 2015 ). One could therefore examine
whether interventions categorised as primarily targeting non-conscious processes are at least equally
effective irrespective of how deprived the population they are applied to is, thus suggesting that their
implementation would not further increase (and may even reduce) health inequalities.
Whilst our predominant focus in this article has been on interventions that do not target conscious
deliberation and are instead more likely to activate behaviour outside awareness, our framework canalso be applied to more re ﬂective interventions, which we would expect to cluster on the opposing
end of an assumed spectrum of awareness. Testing this assertion will also require the assessment of
awareness in intervention contexts that we may currently assume work predominantly via conscious
activation of behaviour. A ﬁnal point is that, although we have framed this work primarily in relation
to interventions to change health-related behaviour with the purpose of improving health, any devel-
opments in this area have the potential to inform other contexts in which the goal is to change beha-
viours across populations, such as pro-environmental behaviours to mitigate climate change (e.g.,
energy use and recycling), and consumer behaviours, where the purpose may be to change con-sumption in a way that may harm health.
Conclusion
The framework we have outlined provides a basis for developing tests of our original premise, namelythat interventions that target non-conscious processes and are less reliant on reﬂ ective, conscious
engagement have signi ﬁcant potential for changing behaviour across populations. At this early
stage of development, the potential value of the proposed framework rests principally in informingattempts to assess whether (a) awareness of the effects of interventions will indeed vary by degree,
and that (b) this has implications for understanding and ultimately enhancing their effectiveness in
changing behaviour. There are undoubtedly signi ﬁcant conceptual and practical challenges to be
overcome, but we assert that these are outweighed by the potential bene ﬁts of such an approach.
These include theoretical and methodological developments as well as, ultimately, interventions tochange population behaviour that are both better understood and more effective.
