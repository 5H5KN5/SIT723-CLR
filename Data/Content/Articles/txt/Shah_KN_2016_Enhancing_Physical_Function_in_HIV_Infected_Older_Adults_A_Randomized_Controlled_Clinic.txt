Abstract
Objective— HIV-infected older adults (HOA) are at risk of functional decline. Interventions 
promoting physical activity that can attenuate functional decline and are easily translated into the 
HOA community are of high priority. We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial to 
evaluate whether a physical activity counseling intervention based on self-determination theory 
(SDT) improves physical function, autonomous motivation, depression and the quality of life 
(QOL) in HOA.
Methods— A total of 67 community-dwelling HOA with mild-to-moderate functional limitations 
were randomized to one of two groups: a physical activity counseling group or the usual care 
control group. We used SDT to guide the development of the experimental intervention. Outcome 
measures that were collected at baseline and final study visits included a battery of physical 
function tests, levels of physical activity, autonomous motivation, depression, and QOL.
Results— The study participants were similar in their demographic and clinical characteristics in 
both the treatment and control groups. Overall physical performance, gait speed, measures of

endurance and strength, and levels of physical activity improved in the treatment group compared 
to the control group (p<0.05). Measures of autonomous regulation such as identified regulation, 
and measures of depression and QOL improved significantly in the treatment group compared to 
the control group (p<0.05). Across the groups, improvement in intrinsic regulation and QOL 
correlated with an improvement in physical function (p<0.05).
Conclusion— Our findings suggest that a physical activity counseling program grounded in SDT 
can improve physical function, autonomous motivation, depression, and QOL in HOA with 
functional limitations.
INTRODUCTION
The age distribution of the American population is currently experiencing a dramatic 
demographic shift towards that of older ages. This demographic shift is also apparent among 
HIV-infected individuals, who are living longer in part due to more effective anti-retroviral 
therapy (ART) and infections occurring later in life. The number of HIV-infected older 
adults (HOA) has significantly increased over the last two decades ( Effros et al., 2008 ). HIV-
infected individuals are identified by the CDC as being “older adults” at the relatively young 
age of 50 years old (“HIV Among People Aged 50 and Older,” para. 1). Some argue that 
HIV-infected adults experience signs of accelerated aging at a younger age compared to the 
general population ( Pathai, Bajillan, Landay, & High, 2014 ). Individuals with HIV infection, 
for example, are at risk of complex chronic diseases with multiple comorbidities at an earlier 
age than uninfected individuals ( Guaraldi et al., 2011 ). Further, 50 years and older happens 
to reflect the upper age range for HIV-infected individuals ( Luther & Wilkin, 2007 ) as the 
life expectancy of infected individuals despite adequate ART is still lower than that of the 
general population ( Hogg et al., 2008 ).
Studies have shown that this cohort can have reduced physical function and can experience 
higher prevalence of physical frailty characteristics at a younger age compared to uninfected 
individuals ( Desquilbet et al., 2009 ; Oursler, Sorkin, Smith, & Katzel, 2006 ; Rees, Meister, 
Mohler, & Klotz, 2014 ; Shah et al., 2014 ). Some of the functional impairments seen in HIV-
infected individuals are comparable in a physiological sense to those sometimes seen in 10–
15 years older people who are uninfected ( Desquilbet et al., 2007 ). We note that there is 
research demonstrating functional impairments in this population ( Brothers et al., 2014 ). 
However, the research evaluating the level and intensity of physical activity (PA) 
engagement in this population is limited and inconclusive ( Schuelter-Trevisol et al., 2012 ). 
One study reported that HIV-infected individuals engage in less vigorous physical activity 
than HIV-uninfected ones ( Smit et al., 2006 ), while a separate study reported the opposite 
(Fillipas et al., 2008 ).
It is well known that even modest amounts of PA can improve physical function and quality 
of life (QOL) in older adults ( Pahor et al., 2006 ). However, the majority of older adults do 
not exert enough PA to realize the benefits ( Harvey, Chastin, & Skelton, 2013 ; Taylor, 2014 ). 
The promotion of PA has become a public health priority worldwide. Unfortunately, the HIV 
infected population is a challenging cohort with respect to behavior change. HIV-infected 
patients, and particularly HOA, tend to be socioeconomically disadvantaged, live in isolation Shah et al. Page 2

because of their often limited support network, suffer from depression, experience negative 
perceptions in the community, and can have multiple comorbidities ( Emlet, 2006 ; Lyons, 
Pitts, Grierson, Thorpe, & Power, 2010 ; Roger, Mignone, & Kirkland, 2013 ; Shippy & 
Karpiak, 2005 ). These factors can negatively impact HOA persons’ motivation and ability to 
comply with recommended behavior change such as engaging in PA.
Interestingly, findings from a recent study suggest that physical frailty in HIV-infected 
patients is potentially reversible and is positively associated with depression and inversely 
related with low PA ( Rees, Meister, Mohler, & Klotz, 2014 ). In this study, essentially all of 
the participants who were frail and had low PA were also depressed. This study concluded 
that interventions aimed at increasing PA and stimulating emotional well-being are needed 
to prevent and ameliorate physical frailty in this target population. To date, the majority of 
research in HIV and frailty has focused on the understanding of biological and social 
determinants of HIV-related frailty and functional decline ( Brothers et al., 2014 ). There has 
been limited research done with respect to identifying effective translational interventions 
aimed at preventing or ameliorating frailty in this group. Further research is warranted to 
develop evidence-based guidelines to promote PA, and thereby prevent functional decline in 
this challenging population.
Previous clinical trials conducted in the HIV-uninfected adult population suggest that the 
self-determination theory (SDT) is a suitable framework for understanding and promoting 
PA (Fortier, Duda, Guerin, & Teixeira, 2012 ; Teixeira, Carraca, Markland, Silva, & Ryan, 
2012 ). SDT is a unique and effective theory of human motivation in which a patient’s needs 
for autonomy are acknowledged ( Ryan & Deci, 2000 ; Teixeira, Carraca, Markland, Silva, & 
Ryan, 2012 ). The SDT environment encourages one to become self-determined 
(autonomous) to engage in activities, while at the same time internalizing the motivation to 
regulated behaviors, which may not be initially interesting or valued. To foster this 
internalization, a patient-centered approach is used. An approach that satisfies the 
psychological needs of relatedness, autonomy, and competence is encouraged ( Deci & Ryan, 
2012 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ; Teixeira, Carraca, Markland, Silva, & Ryan, 2012 ).
An intervention that fosters psychological need satisfaction for PA can boost emotional well-
being and help alleviate some of the barriers that would normally prevent HOA from 
engaging in PA. Of note, SDT has been used for PA intervention clinical trials for adults and 
has been proven to be beneficial in improving PA ( Teixeira, Carraca, Markland, Silva, & 
Ryan, 2012 ). The majority of the SDT-based PA intervention trials in adults had duration of 
about 3 months or less with the participants ( Edmunds, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2008 ; Fortier, 
Sweet, O’Sullivan, & Williams, 2007 ; Levy & Cardinal, 2004 ). In one 13-week study, the 
contact time between the study team and participant entailed three in-person counseling 
sessions followed by three telephone sessions ( Fortier, Sweet, O’Sullivan, & Williams, 
2007 ). This study found that the intervention was successful in changing autonomous 
motivation and increasing PA.
Similarly, a 10-week study with follow-up at one year found that it’s SDT based PA 
intervention resulted in increased PA engagement at follow-up ( Van Hoecke et al., 2013 ). 
Another study with 30 intervention sessions over one year duration demonstrated increased Shah et al. Page 3

autonomous motivation and higher PA engagement in the intervention group ( Silva et al., 
2010 ). Autonomous motivation was found to be a mediator of long-term engagement in PA 
(Silva et al., 2011 ). Moreover, a previous clinical trial has demonstrated that autonomous 
motivation is also a predictor of improved exercise capacity ( Mildestvedt, Meland, & Eide, 
2008 ). Taken together, these findings suggest that improvements in autonomous motivation 
can not only contribute to maintenance of PA, but also can potentially predict improvements 
in PA related physiologic outcomes. Therefore, the literature on SDT based PA interventions 
in adults provides evidence for using SDT-based interventions in improving PA levels and 
changing PA behavior. However, there is paucity of research using SDT-based intervention 
in evaluating the effect on physiological and biological markers of PA-related health 
outcomes such as physical function.
Physical function is an important health outcome because functional decline is associated 
with negative health outcomes such as increased morbidity, mortality, nursing home 
admissions, and poor QOL ( Fried et al., 2001 ). In fact, one very recent study in HOA 
demonstrated that physical function is a predictor of QOL independent of age, 
comorbidities, and immune function ( Erlandson et al., 2014 ) suggesting the importance of 
designing interventions that can improve physical function in this population.
The primary purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of a PA counseling intervention 
grounded in SDT on physical function compared to the usual care in HOA. Our hypothesis 
was that physical function will improve in the treatment group compared to the control 
group. The secondary purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of our intervention on 
PA specific needs of autonomy and competence, autonomous motivation for PA, depression, 
and QOL. Our hypothesis was that the above-mentioned variables will improve in the 
treatment group compared to the control group. Lastly, we explored whether changes in 
physical function are associated with changes in QOL and autonomous motivation. Our 
hypothesis was that changes in physical function will positively correlate with changes with 
QOL and autonomous motivation.
METHODS
Participants
Community-dwelling HOA were recruited from our urban University of Rochester Medical 
Center (URMC) hospital-based infectious disease clinic, which provides services to over 
1,000 HIV-infected patients. Eligibility criteria for study enrollment included: HIV positive, 
age ≥45 years, stable antiretroviral therapy (ART), and functional limitations as measured by 
physical performance test score <36. Exclusion criteria included: any AIDS defining illness 
for six months prior to enrollment or comorbid medical conditions that would prevent the 
participant from engaging in PA. Participants with severe cardiopulmonary illness, severe 
anemia, significant orthopedic or neuromuscular limitations, renal failure, cirrhosis, 
significant cognitive or sensory limitations, untreated depression, unstable manic or 
psychotic disorder, and active malignancy were excluded. Participant medical histories were 
obtained from self-completed questionnaires and from electronic medical records. An 
informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment and the study was 
approved by the URMC’s Research Participants Review Board.Shah et al. Page 4

Study Design
Baseline Assessments
Assessment of Physical Function: The Physical Performance Test (PPT) is a global 
measure of physical function that assesses the ability to perform usual daily activities 
(Brown, Sinacore, Binder, & Kohrt, 2000 ; Shah et al., 2012 ; Villareal et al., 2011 ). The PPT 
includes seven standardized timed tasks (50-foot walk, putting on and removing a coat, 
picking up a penny, standing up from a chair, lifting a book, climbing one flight of stairs, 
and a progressive Romberg test) and two additional tasks (climbing four flights of stairs and 
performing a 360 degree turn). The score for each item ranges between 0 and 4, with a 
perfect score equal to 36 ( Brown, Sinacore, Binder, & Kohrt, 2000 ; Shah et al., 2012 ; 
Villareal et al., 2011 ). A MicroFET 2, hand-held dynamometer was used to measure knee 
extension and flexion muscle strength ( Schaubert & Bohannon, 2005 ). Isometric strength 
was determined by calculating the mean peak force from three trials. Dynamic balance was 
assessed as the time needed to complete an obstacle course whereby participants stand from 
a sitting position from a standard 18-inch high chair, walk forward 6 feet, step over a 2 × 2-
inch obstacle, walk forward another 6 feet, ascend a 6-inch high curb, turn around, step 
down off the curb, and return to the chair as quickly and safely as possible ( Brown, 
Sinacore, Binder, & Kohrt, 2000 ; Shah et al., 2012 ; Villareal et al., 2011 ). Aerobic capacity 
was evaluated by a six-minute walk test ( Enright et al., 2003 ) in which participants were 
instructed to cover as much distance as possible in six minutes by walking laps over a 100-
feet course. Finally, gait speed was measured as the time needed to walk 50 feet as quickly 
and safely as possible ( Brown, Sinacore, Binder, & Kohrt, 2000 ; Shah et al., 2012 ; Villareal 
et al., 2011 ). All functional measures were performed by a single experienced technician 
who was blinded to the study groups.
Assessment of Physical Activity Level: Each participant’s level of PA was determined by 
the 12-item Physical Activities Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire ( Washburn, 
Smith, Jette, & Janney, 1993 ). The PASE score is determined by questions related to leisure, 
household, and work-related activities ( Washburn, McAuley, Katula, Mihalko, & Boileau, 
1999 ). PASE assesses the frequency, duration, and intensity level (mild, moderate and 
strenuous) of activity over the previous week with higher scores indicating greater physical 
activity. We also used the Paffenburger Physical Activity Index to assess weekly energy 
expended through leisure time PA ( Paffenbarger et al., 1993 ; Paffenbarger, Wing, & Hyde, 
1995 ).
Assessment of Self-Determination for PA: This outcome was assessed using SDT based 
instruments. The 3-item Locus of Causality for PA scale assesses the participant’s autonomy 
regarding performing PA ( Markland & Hardy, 1997 ; Silva et al., 2008 ). This scale indicates 
the extent to which the individual feels that he/she chooses to engage in PA rather than 
feeling that they are pressured to do so. Responses are scored on a 7-point Likert scale, 
ranging from 1 (not true at all) to 7 (very true), with higher scores indicating a greater 
perceived autonomy or a greater self-determination. Autonomous motivation or regulation 
for PA was also assessed using the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2 
(Moustaka, Vlachopoulos, Vazou, Kaperoni, & Markland, 2010 ), which consists of two 
subscales: identified regulation (i.e. valuing the benefits of PA) and intrinsic motivation (i.e. Shah et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
experiencing enjoyment of PA). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 
(not true at all for me) to 5 (very true for me) with higher scores indicating more 
autonomous motivation. The Perceived Competence scale is a 4-item scale that assesses 
perceived confidence regarding performing PA. Participants rate their degree of confidence 
on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very true) ( Williams, Grow, 
Freedman, Ryan, & Deci, 1996 ).
Assessment of Depression: The Beck Depression Inventory-II is a 21-item depression 
inventory designed to assess depressive symptomatology ( Beck, Steer, Ball, & Ranieri, 
1996 ). Scores on the individual items range from 0 to 3. Total scores can range between 0 
and 63 with higher scores reflecting higher levels of depression.
Assessment of Health-Related QOL: The Short-Form Health Survey (36-item) is a patient-
reported survey of patient health ( Erlandson et al., 2014 ; Lyons, Perry, & Littlepage, 1994 ; 
McHorney, Ware, & Raczek, 1993 ). This survey was used to evaluate the participant’s 
perception of QOL in the domains of physical functioning, role limitations due to physical 
health, emotional well-being, social functioning and general health with higher scores 
indicating greater QOL.
Treatment and Control Interventions
Randomization: Participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the 
usual care control group. We chose to stratify our participants by gender to balance our study 
design because there is a higher prevalence of HIV in men compared to women (“HIV 
Among Men in the United States,” para. 1). Assignment leveraged a computer generated 
randomization strategy stratified for gender. The randomization algorithm was maintained 
by a member of the research team who did not interact with the participants.
The treatment group intervention, based on the SDT model of behavior change, consisted of 
a PA counseling program designed to maximize opportunities for personal decision-making, 
while giving the support needed to ensure proper education. We conducted 6 patient-
centered counseling sessions based on the SDT model of behavior change ( Ryan, 2008 ). The 
sessions were conducted with the patients in this group over the study duration. The first 
counseling session was a 60-minute face-to-face session by a physician and an experienced 
mental health therapist who were trained in SDT. During this first session, we established a 
rapport and took time to understand the individual’s interests, values, and behaviors. This 
information was used to assist participants with the behavior change process. Participants 
were encouraged to discuss barriers to PA and solutions to overcoming them, and when 
appropriate and desired, they were provided with potential strategies such as time 
management and self-monitoring. This autonomy supportive session also facilitated 
participants in setting appropriate PA goals for the following two weeks and an overall 
action plan. Every two weeks, participants were supported through follow-up telephone 
counseling sessions. These follow-up sessions were conducted by a graduate student in 
clinical investigation who was specifically trained in SDT and was also involved in the 
initial face to face counseling sessions. These 15–30 minute phone calls were used to 
provide positive feedback, re-evaluate and modify goals if necessary, and to provide Shah et al. Page 6

autonomy support to facilitate persistence for participants chosen PA goals. To ensure proper 
education and support, participants in this group were offered an individually tailored PA 
prescription recommended by an experienced physical therapist that was aimed at improving 
endurance and strength. Consistent with the SDT model, participants took an active role in 
the customization of their own PA program. The first component of the program was a 
walking prescription that provided aerobic exercise of moderate intensity. Based on their 
values and goals, participants would choose a program of varying degrees of intensity. The 
second component of the program was a strength training prescription designed to provide 
moderate to intense resistance exercise targeting both the upper and lower body. The 
participants, if interested in this program, were given a set of 3 color-coded therapeutic 
resistance bands representing varying levels of resistance to perform the exercise program 
and were educated regarding the frequency and intensity of resistance training. They were 
asked to initiate a number of sets (1 set = 8–15 repetitions), which were customized for each 
individual for each of the 10 exercises at a moderately challenging level. The participant 
played an active role in customizing his or her PA program as they were given options to 
choose the exercises and their frequency and intensity. These exercises targeted the upper 
and lower body. If possible, the participants were encouraged to progressively increase 
intensity from their baseline sets and repetitions to a maximum of 4 sets of 15 repetitions for 
each exercise. The participants in the treatment group were asked not to discuss the study or 
intervention with other patients during the study period.
Participants assigned to the control group intervention were instructed to maintain their 
usual activities during the study period. This group did not receive any PA counseling or 
recommendations.
Evaluation of intervention
After 12 weeks, all assessments performed at baseline were repeated in the treatment and 
control groups.
Statistical Analysis
The number of participants enrolled in this study was based on the PPT data (primary 
outcome) we previously obtained ( Villareal et al., 2011 ). We estimated that 28 participants 
would be needed to detect a clinically meaningful 1.7±2.0 (mean±SD) difference in PPT 
score change between groups with a > 80% power and a 0.05 significance level.
The analysis was performed using SAS 9.3. Baseline characteristics between groups were 
compared by using the t-test for unpaired samples for continuous variables and the Chi-
square test for categorical variables. PROC MIXED was used to perform one-way repeated 
ANOV A to determine whether the change in outcomes between the treatment group and the 
control group was significantly different by examining the group × time effect. Demographic 
and clinical variables known to affect outcomes, including age, sex, race, alcohol use (yes or 
no), viral load detectable (yes or no), nadir CD4 cell count and CD4 cell count at baseline, 
were entered as covariates in the repeated ANOV A analysis. Significant within-group 
changes were studied by Contrast statement in PROC MIXED. Pearson correlation analysis 
was applied to investigate the association among residualized change scores (observed score Shah et al. Page 7

at final – predicted score at final based on baseline score) in the physical functions variables 
and autonomous motivation and QOL variables. For our tests, p<0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Results from repeated ANOV A are reported in Tables 2 to 4, as 
estimated population means (standard errors), and P-values for group × time effects.
RESULTS
Figure 1 depicts a flow chart of study participation. A total of 121 participants were assessed 
for eligibility and screening. Of this total, 28 did not meet inclusion criteria, while 26 
declined to participate further. The remaining 67 were randomized into two groups: 1) the 
treatment group (n=33) or 2) the control group (n=34). Eight participants were not able to 
complete the study for a variety of reasons; 5 participants from the treatment group and 3 
participants from the control group (see Figure 1). Thus a total of 59 participants 
successfully completed the study and were included in the analyses. Ninety-three percent of 
participants in the treatment group participated in at least four out of six PA counseling 
sessions.
Table 1 presents selected baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 59 
participants who completed the study. Mean scores on these variables were similar between 
the treatment and control groups; none were statistically significantly different (p<0.05).
Table 2 presents group comparisons on measures of physical function and PA levels. Overall 
physical performance (PPT total score), 6-min walk, gait speed, chair rise, knee extensor 
strength, PASE score, and weekly energy expenditure (Paff Index) all showed greater 
improvement in the treatment group compared to controls. The obstacle course demonstrated 
a trend of improvement in the treatment group as compared to the control group (p=0.06). 
There was no evidence to indicate greater improvement in knee flexor strength in treatment 
relative to control group. There were significant improvements in a majority of the measures 
for physical function and activity within the treatment group, but not in the control group 
(p<0.05).
Table 3 presents group comparisons of measures of self-determination for PA. Compared to 
the control group, the treatment group presented significantly higher scores in locus of 
causality and identified regulation (p<0.05). Our results did not show clear evidence of 
treatment effects on, perceived competence, or intrinsic regulation (p>0.05).
Group comparisons on measures of depression and QOL are presented in Table 4. Compared 
to the control group, the treatment group exhibited significantly improved scores in 
depression and two QOL domains: emotional well-being and role limitations due to physical 
health (p<0.05). Physical functioning domain demonstrated a trend of improvement in the 
treatment group compared to the control group (p=0.08). With regard to general health and 
social functioning domains of QOL there were no differences between treatment and control 
groups.
We found that the changes in intrinsic motivation, emotional well-being, and role limitations 
due to physical health correlated significantly with changes in physical functioning as 
measured by gait speed (see Figure 2). Furthermore, changes in intrinsic motivation and role Shah et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
limitations due to physical health also correlated significantly with changes in PPT and chair 
rise (p<0.05). There was no significant correlation between changes in identified regulation 
and physical function variables. We used residualized change scores to evaluate the 
correlation of changes in autonomous motivation and QOL domains with changes in 
physical function variables. The residualized change scores were obtained by regressing 
each outcome at final stage on their baseline values. In this way, we correct for regression to 
the mean. We initially fitted cohort-specific correlation models. However, the model fitting 
results suggested no significant difference in the correlations between the two groups. 
Therefore, we pooled all of the data and used Pearson correlation analysis to explore the 
relationships (see Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
The American population is experiencing a dramatic demographic shift towards older ages, 
and this includes HIV-infected individuals. The growing number of older adults with HIV is 
also due to the success of antiretroviral therapy which has extended the lifespan of those 
infected, an increasing incidence of HIV among older adults, and the overall aging of the 
population ( Onen & Overton, 2009 ). The HOA cohort is a challenging population because 
these individuals often exhibit multiple psychosocial problems, such as poor socio-economic 
conditions, social isolation, HIV stigma, and depression ( Emlet, 2006 ; Roger, Mignone, & 
Kirkland, 2013 ; Shippy & Karpiak, 2005 ), which can interfere with their ability to engage in 
PA. Moreover, HOA also experience increased comorbidity burden and functional 
limitations ( Onen & Overton, 2009 ), thereby raising concerns among health care providers 
about their ability to age successfully.
Although it is known that even a modest amount of PA can improve physical function in 
older adults, the majority of older adults remains sedentary and has not incorporated this 
behavior change into their lifestyle ( Harvey, Chastin, & Skelton, 2013 ). As a result, the 
promotion of PA, especially in older adults, has become a top priority in the public health 
agenda. The main purpose of this study was thus to evaluate an intervention that can be 
easily implemented within the HOA community to promote PA and improve physical 
function. The results suggest that a PA counseling intervention grounded in SDT can 
improve physical function, depression and QOL in HOA with functional limitations. This 
finding is especially important because there is a dramatic increase in the number of HOA 
who are at high risk of functional decline ( Desquilbet et al., 2007 ; Shah et al., 2014 ). Further 
research is warranted to provide evidence-based guidelines to promote sustained PA in this 
population.
The results of this study are similar to other clinical trials in HIV-uninfected participants 
using interventions to promote PA based on SDT. Yet to our best knowledge this is the first 
study to evaluate this approach targeting the HOA population. Previous clinical trials have 
investigated the role of exercise in improving functional capacity (as measured by aerobic 
capacity and strength) in HIV-infected adults. Contrary to our study, these clinical trials 
targeted mostly young, healthy HIV-infected adults, and did not evaluate overall physical 
function ( Dolan et al., 2006 ; Mutimura, Crowther, Cade, Yarasheski, & Stewart, 2008 ; Roos, 
Myezwa, van Aswegen, & Musenge, 2014 ; Terry et al., 2006 ). Examining overall physical Shah et al. Page 9

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
performance and gait speed is important because it evaluates the ability of older adults to 
perform day-to-day activities and can measure the risk of frailty and mortality ( Brown, 
Sinacore, Binder, & Kohrt, 2000 ; Studenski et al., 2011 ). An isolated measure of strength 
and aerobic capacity is usually considered insufficient to identify frailty and related loss of 
independence. Furthermore, prior studies have not used a counseling intervention grounded 
in SDT in their PA interventions. Using a theoretical model is critical because it can identify 
important barriers to sustained behavior change leading to improved PA ( Fortier, Duda, 
Guerin, & Teixeira, 2012 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ).
This study was guided by the framework of the SDT, a theory of human motivation that is 
designed to produce behavior change ( Deci & Ryan, 2012 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ). SDT draws 
a clear distinction between autonomous motivation (i.e. doing something willingly because it 
is consistent with values, personal commitments and intrinsic interests) and controlled forms 
of motivation (e.g., pleasing others or being pressured or coerced). Interestingly, we found 
that participants who showed improvement in intrinsic motivation also showed an 
improvement in gait speed. This finding suggests that this form of autonomous motivation 
for PA may be important to healthy aging because gait speed is considered as a marker of 
biological aging and an important predictor of survival ( Studenski et al., 2011 ). This finding 
is also particularly relevant in the HOA cohort, as a recent longitudinal study demonstrated 
that HOA experience not only a lower gait speed, but also an accelerated decline in gait 
speed after the age of sixty compared to HIV-uninfected individuals ( Schrack et al., 2014 ).
Our intervention was of 12-week duration. Other PA interventions in adults grounded in 
SDT also used a 12-week or less duration ( Edmunds, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2008 ; Fortier, 
Sweet, O’Sullivan, & Williams, 2007 ; Levy & Cardinal, 2004 ). This relatively short duration 
time was sufficient in demonstrating beneficial effects of moderate PA on physical function. 
Moreover, there is evidence to support that physiological adaptations to increase in PA can 
be seen as early as 6 weeks. ( Murrock & Graor, 2014 ; Mustian et al., 2009 ). With respect to 
PA counseling sessions, participants in our study took part in 6 total sessions which included 
follow-up sessions on the telephone similar to that used in the study of Fortier ( Fortier, 
Sweet, O’Sullivan, & Williams, 2007 ).
The goal of our intervention was to maximize opportunities for personal decision making, 
while giving the resources and support needed to ensure proper education and facilitate 
autonomous motivation which has been proven to result in behavior change ( Ryan, 2008 ). In 
this respect, our intervention resulted in significant improvement in identified regulation for 
PA (i.e., valuing the benefits of PA), which is consistent with previous studies that targeted 
HIV uninfected participants ( Silva et al., 2011 ; Silva et al., 2010 ; Van Hoecke et al., 2013 ). 
There was not a statistically significant improvement in intrinsic regulation for PA (i.e. 
experience the pleasure of PA), which might be due to the small sample size and/or the short 
duration of our intervention. Future studies with a larger sample size and longer duration are 
warranted to develop interventions than can foster both internalization and intrinsic 
regulation and lead to behavior change in this cohort.
Finally, our study did not show an improvement in PA-related perceived competence within 
the treatment group. We speculate that the lack of improvement in this measure was because Shah et al. Page 10

the perceived competence scores were exaggerated at baseline in our participants, possibly 
from a lack of experiential knowledge regarding PA or from an initial social desirability 
effect. This finding was also reported in other clinical trials in HIV-uninfected participants 
using PA interventions grounded in SDT ( Fortier, Duda, Guerin, & Teixeira, 2012 ; Fortier, 
Sweet, O’Sullivan, & Williams, 2007 ). Even so, our study did show a significant 
improvement with respect to participant’s autonomy and identified regulation for PA in the 
treatment group compared to the control group ( Ryan & Deci, 2000 ).
We acknowledge several limitations of our study, and reiterate some of the strengths. First, 
the duration of the intervention was relatively short, yet we were able to detect significant 
improvements in functional outcome, demonstrating the efficacy of our brief intervention. 
Second, we were unable to collect weekly data on PA levels, however we were able to 
collect data on PA levels both pre and post intervention. Third, the control and the treatment 
group did not have the similar amount of contact time. Lastly, we did not use instruments 
that measure PA specific need satisfaction which have been previously used in SDT-based 
exercise psychology literature such as basic psychological need in exercise scale and 
psychological need satisfaction in exercise scale ( Vlachopoulos & Michailidou, 2006 ; 
Wilson, 2006 ). Of note, other important studies in this field also have not measured PA-
specific need satisfaction ( Silva et al., 2010 ; Van Hoecke et al., 2013 ). The strengths of our 
study include the randomized controlled study design and low attrition rates. Our study 
population also represented a diverse minority population. This is important because not 
only are racial and ethnic minorities less likely to engage in PA compared to whites, but they 
are also at an increased risk of chronic diseases and related negative outcomes associated 
with sedentism ( August & Sorkin, 2011 ).
In conclusion, our findings provide preliminary evidence that a PA counseling intervention 
based on SDT is not only feasible, but also successful in improving physical function, 
autonomous motivation, depression, and QOL in HOA with functional limitations. The 
dramatic shift in the age demographics of the people living with HIV signifies an urgent 
need for identifying clinical interventions that can be readily translated into the HOA 
community to foster sustained behavior change of increased PA and attenuate functional 
decline. The end goal is to promote healthy aging in this cohort and improve their QOL. 
Future large-scale studies of longer duration are warranted to validate and extend our results 
with this end goal in mind.
