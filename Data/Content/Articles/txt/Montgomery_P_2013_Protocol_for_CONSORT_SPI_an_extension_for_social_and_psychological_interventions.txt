Abstract
Background: Determining the effectiveness of social and psychological interventions is important for improving
individual and population health. Such interventions are complex and, where possible, are best evaluated by
randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The use of research findings in policy and practice decision making is hindered
by poor reporting of RCTs. Poor reporting limits the ability to replicate interventions, synthesise evidence in
systematic reviews, and utilise findings for evidence-based policy and practice. The lack of guidance for reporting
the specific methodological features of complex intervention RCTs contributes to poor reporting. We aim to
develop an extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement for Social and Psychological
Interventions (CONSORT-SPI).
Methods/design: This research project will be conducted in five phases. The first phase was the project launch,
which consisted of the establishment of a Project Executive and International Advisory Group, and recruitment of
journal editors and the CONSORT Group. The second phase involves a Delphi process that will generate a list of
possible items to include in the CONSORT Extension. Next, there will be a formal consensus meeting to select the
reporting items to add to, or modify for, the CONSORT-SPI Extension. Fourth, guideline documents will be written,
including an explanation and elaboration (E&E) document that will provide detailed advice for each item and
examples of good reporting. The final phase will comprise guideline dissemination, with simultaneous publication
and endorsement of the guideline in multiple journals, endorsement by funding agencies, presentations at
conferences and other meetings, and a dedicated website that will facilitate feedback about the guideline.
Conclusion: As demonstrated by previous CONSORT guidelines, the development of an evidence-based reporting
guideline for social and psychological intervention RC Ts should improve the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and
transparency of study reports. This, in turn, promises to i mprove the critical appraisal of research and its use in
policy and practice decision making. We invite reader s to participate in the project by visiting our website

Background
Social and psychological interventions that aim to improve
health and related outcomes are often complex and chal-
lenging to evaluate. As outlined in the Medical Research
Council (MRC, UK) Framework for developing and evalu-
ating complex interventions [1], they usually have mul-
tiple, interacting components at several levels, and mayhave multiple and variable outcomes that require sophisti-
cated assessments and analyses. Randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) provide the least biased estimates of effect-
iveness despite these complexities [2]. When reported
clearly and completely, RCTs can be appropriately in-
cluded in systematic reviews and practice guidelines, lead-
ing to better routine service and policy-related outcomes.
When detailed information about study conduct is poorly
reported, or not reported at all, the link between research
and practice is weakened, and scarce resources are
wasted [3]. Thus, to have its intended impact, the* Correspondence: e.mayo-wilson@ucl.ac.uk

methods for reporting trials must be as rigorous as those
for conducting them.
Reporting guidelines
Reporting guidelines do not prescribe research conduct;
they suggest those items of information that are ne-
cessary to understand how a study was conducted. The
most widely-cited reporting guideline is the ConsolidatedStandards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement.
Its main checklist has 25-items for reporting two-group
parallel RCTs [4], and extension guidelines addressother types of medical RCTs, such as cluster [5], prag-
matic [6], and non-pharmacological intervention trials
[7]. Opinion leaders and decision makers made rigor-ous use of empirical evidence and consensus develop-
ment techniques to inform the content of CONSORT
and its extension guidelines [8]. Since their publication,the reporting of thousands of medical RCTs have im-
proved [9], with reports published in journals endors-
ing CONSORT improving more than those in otherjournals [10,11].
A new guideline for social and psychological intervention
trials
Despite improvements in the reporting of RCTs in med-
ical disciplines, several studies indicate that the reportingquality of RCTs in the social and behavioural sciences
remains suboptimal [12-16]. We conducted a systematic
review of reporting guidelines for social and psycho-logical intervention RCTs, as well as the quality of
current reports of these studies. This review concluded
that existing guidelines lacked the required rigour intheir development, they have important limitations in
their included reporting guidance, and they are poorly
disseminated. Furthermore, most leading journals inthese disciplines do not ask authors to follow any
reporting guides, and important details are routinely
missing from publications of social and psychologicalintervention RCTs [17].
To address these issues, many researchers and journal
editors have proposed amending the CONSORT State-ment to address these important complexities of social
and psychological interventions and of their evaluation
[18-23]. A new CONSORT extension developed by dra-wing on previous reporting guidance, up-to-date scien-
tific literature, and stakeholder involvement and insight,
could significantly improve the reporting of social andpsychological intervention RCTs. This paper describes
the project plan for a new guideline —CONSORT-SPI —
which will include a checklist of reporting items and aparticipant flowchart that offer authors recommenda-
tions to accurately, comprehensively, and transparently
describe these studies.Methods/design
The methods will follow recommended techniques fordeveloping and disseminating reporting guidelines[9,24]. Aspects of these methods have been previously
used to develop the CONSORT statement [4] and its ex-
tensions [25-28]; the SPIRIT statement for trial protocols[29]; and other guidelines [5,6]. This earlier work sug-
gests the project will take 20 to 24 months to complete
[24]. The project will involve five phases: the projectlaunch, a Delphi process, a consensus development con-
ference, writing up the guideline documents, and guide-
line implementation (see Figure 1).
Phase one: project launch
To ensure project success, the following have alreadybeen secured for the launch of the project: a project ex-
ecutive; an International Advisory Group (IAG) of key
opinion leaders across core fields; participation fromhigh impact-factor journal editors for the consensus
process; agreement from and collaboration with the
CONSORT Group; and funding to support guidelinedevelopment and dissemination.
Project executive
T h ep r o j e c te x e c u t i v e( P M ,E M W ,S G ,S M ,G M ,S H ,
and DM) has developed the project protocol and secured
funding to complete the project, and are assembling theIAG and recruiting various stakeholders ( e.g., trialists,
methodologists, practitioners, policy makers, funders,
and recipients of services). The project executive willalso run future phases of the project, including the
Delphi process, consensus meeting, write-up of the re-
sultant guideline documents, and the implementationstrategy.
International advisory group (IAG)
This team of key opinion leaders will advise at each pro-
ject stage, and will help draft and disseminate the final
guideline documents. Members are leading experts insocial and psychological interventions across various dis-
ciplines (see Acknowledgments). They will help recruit
stakeholders to participate in the project and identifytopics to discuss at each stage. They will aid dissemin-
ation by endorsing and using the guideline, and by pre-
senting it to relevant stakeholders in their respectivefields.
Journal editors
The most widely used reporting guidelines have enlisted
journal editors during development and acquired official
journal endorsement upon completion [9]. To begin thiseffort, editors of high impact-factor journals in key disci-
plines have been approached, and many have already
agreed to participate. We encourage any other journalMontgomery et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:99 Page 2 of 7
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/8/1/99
editors interested in participating in the project to con-
tact us [30-37].
CONSORT group
To increase successful uptake, new reporting guidelines
for RCTs should be officially related to the CONSORTStatement. Previous reviews have found no high impact-
factor journal that explicitly recommends an RCT repor-
ting guideline other than the CONSORT statement [38].Members of the CONSORT Group (DM and SH) are in-
volved in this project, and the resultant guideline will be
an official extension of the CONSORT Statement. TheCONSORT Group ’s success, collective experience, and
prominence in the reporting guideline field —including
the more recent SPIRIT guidelines for reporting protocolsof trials [29] —will help to ensure the use of proper
methods for developing and disseminating a high-
quality reporting guideline.
Phase two: the Delphi process
The purpose of phase two is to identify those areas inthe reporting of social and psychological intervention
trials that are most important for inclusion in the guide-
line. To involve a wide range of participants at thisphase, an online, modified Delphi process will be
conducted. The Delphi process will consist of a series of
structured questionnaires completed anonymously byexpert participants. Summarised responses from each
questionnaire will be returned to the participants after
each round, along with a new questionnaire to answer,PHASE 1: Project Launch

until consensus is reached [39]. This process will help
address areas of uncertainty, and measure and reach
consensus [40].
IAG meeting
The IAG will meet before round one of the Delphiprocess to nominate items for the initial questionnaire
and to suggest credible participants for the process [39].
Prior to the meeting, the IAG will receive literature re-views regarding previous reporting guidelines for social
and psychological intervention RCTs and their reporting
quality, together with feedback from a consultation heldat the 2012 Cochrane Colloquium [41]. These literature
reviews will be used to generate items for the Delphi
round one survey. Procedures for data collection, dataanalysis, and cut-offs for consensus [42] will be decided
in light of recommended techniques for guideline develop-
ment [9], and previous Delphi processes used to developreporting guidelines [27,43].
Recruitment
To enhance credibility and ensure widespread accept-
ance, the project will recruit informed and interested
participants representing stakeholders that the guidelineis intended to influence [42]. The IAG will help identify
an initial list of stakeholders who extensively publish,
fund, or utilise social and psychological intervention re-search, and a ‘snowball recruitment ’approach will be
used via collaborators in relevant research and profes-
sional networks [4,12]. In order to engage those whomight not be identified through snowball recruitment,
the project website enables stakeholders to register their
interest in participating. In addition, a commentary writ-ten by the study team and co-published in several jour-
nals, invites other stakeholders to participate [30-37].
Intervention researchers, methodologists, and guidelinedevelopers will form a substantial number of the partici-
pants [9]. Editors of high impact-factor journals will be
invited for their expertise and to ensure uptake upon com-pletion [44] Funders of social and psychological interven-
tion studies will be invited to provide expertise and to
promote use of the guideline for assessing grant applica-tions [6]. Practitioners will help identify issues of relevance
to practice [45]. Policy makers will help identify items, and
they will assist in the creation of a user-friendly documentand standards [24,46]. Representatives from consumer
groups will advance the relevance of research reports to
the ultimate recipients of services.
Structure
Identified stakeholders will be invited to participate inan online Delphi survey to nominate checklist items for
the CONSORT-SPI Extension. In each round, partici-
pants will be asked to rate (on a 1 to 10 Likert scale) theimportance of including proposed checklist items, ex-
plain the reasons for their ratings, make suggestions for
modifications, and indicate any missing items thatshould be considered. We expect the IAG to propose 25
to 70 checklist items in round one [7,43]. Items in later
rounds will be based on responses from each previousround, and participants will receive summaries of quan-
titative and qualitative responses from the previous
round to inform their new rankings [47]. At the end ofthe Delphi process, high-ranking items will be proposed
for inclusion in the checklist during the consensus meet-
ing. Low-ranking items will not be considered at theconsensus meeting unless the project executive identifies
valuable issues to discuss. Middle-ranking items will be
discussed at the consensus meeting for possible inclu-sion or exclusion. We estimate that two to three rounds
will be needed to obtain consensus, and that each round
will take 30 to 45 minutes to complete [47].
Phase three: consensus development conference
The purpose of phase three is to select the specificreporting items to be included in the new guideline. A
consensus development conference will be held to deter-
mine guideline content, rather than wording or format[40]. This time has been allotted to allow sufficient time
for thorough discussion, reducing hasty decision making
that can hinder judgment [42].
Participants
Participants will be recruite d by discipline from the Delphi
process by the project executive and the IAG, to include a
range of stakeholder perspectives [8]. The size of the
group (20 to 30 participants) will balance diversity ofopinion with opportunities for interaction [9].
Structure
The consensus meeting will follow methods [40] used in
previous CONSORT meetings [4,6,25,27]. Literature re-
views and the results of the Delphi process will be pro-vided to participants in advance, and the conference will
include background presentations [27], to ground con-
versations on empirical information and to facilitatecohesive discussion [42]. Participants will be led in struc-
tured discussions of, and vote on, each item proposed
for the checklist from the Delphi process [27]. Care willbe taken to ensure that all participants express views,
that all ideas are discussed in-depth, and that assertive
participants do not dominate the discussion [42]. Votingwill be confidential using anonymous ballots to promote
honest answers and allow participants to rethink their
position if a re-vote is needed [47]. The meeting willconclude with discussion about optimising dissemin-
ation, and members of the group will commit to specific
efforts to this end [27].Montgomery et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:99 Page 4 of 7

Phase four: drafting the guideline documents
The purpose of this phase is to draft the guideline docu-
ments so that their wording and content is clear, precise,and suitable for all relevant disciplines.
Draft guidelines and elaboration document
Following the consensus meeting, the proposed checklistwill be reviewed by the project executive. The first goalwill be to draft a checklist using concise, unambiguous,
yet comprehensive wording. Each item will be supported
with empirical evidence of previous poor reporting andimplications for internal and external validity. In ad-
dition to the guideline statement, an Explanation and
Elaboration (E&E) Document will explain in-depth thescientific rationale for each recommendation and pro-
vide an example of clear reporting for each item. This
additional document will help editors and authorsunderstand the importance of these guidelines, students
and researchers understand the relevant issues, and au-
thors meet the guideline requirements [9].
Feedback
Drafts of the checklist will be circulated to consensusgroup participants to check that the documents accur-
ately represent the decisions made during the meeting,
provide examples of good reporting for specific items,and are useful for their intended purpose [27]. Feedback
is important to evaluate the validity of consensus methods
[42]. Responses will be incorporated into a statement thatreports the project rationale, process methodology, and
final included reporting items.
Phase five: guideline implementation
The goal of the dissemination plan is to maximise aware-
ness, understanding, and use of the CONSORT Extensionwhen reporting social and psychological intervention
trials.
Dissemination methods
The dissemination strategy includes stakeholder involve-
ment in the design and execution of this project, ensur-ing that the guideline will be acceptable and widely
endorsed. Next, simultaneous publications in multiple,
high impact-factor journals will begin the process of dis-semination and uptake [24]. The IAG will identify and
approach the most appropriate journals in key disci-
plines to publish the guideline and provide an editorialsupporting the guideline. The IAG will ask editors from
all relevant journals to endorse the guideline. Endorse-
ment will involve clear directions in each journal ’s‘In-
structions to Authors ’t h a tt h eg u i d e l i n es h o u l db e
followed and the checklist should be included in all
relevant submissions [24,36].Open-access publications are key to widespread uptake
of the reporting guideline [44]. Our intention is to seek
instant open access publications, allowing us to retainownership of the work to facilitate broad dissemination.
We will also make the guideline, and other relevant doc-
uments, including the E&E document, available on ourwebsite as well as other websites ( e.g., the CONSORT
Group, the EQUATOR Network for reporting guide-
lines). A dedicated webpage will be used to discuss new,relevant evidence related to social and psychological
intervention trials, and to ask the wider scientific com-
munity to provide feedback on their experiences of usingthe guideline, in order to allow for the guideline ’s con-
tinual development [48]. The project executive and IAG
will present the guideline at influential conferences, pro-fessional bodies, and organisations within their respect-
ive fields.
Conclusion
These methods were chosen to develop the best reporting
standards, generate consensus, and promote widespreaddissemination and uptake of CONSORT-SPI. They are
based on best practice and evidence-based principles.
Research-informed purposive sampling by the IAG willprovide a less biased selection of participants than the
project executive could provide alone [42]; the involve-
ment of various stakeholders in guideline developmentwill ensure that a variety of perspectives are captured. The
resulting multidisciplinary, international consensus will
maximise the impact of the guideline beyond any special-ist field [40]. Moreover, formal consensus development
methods are increasingly employed in guideline develop-
ment, especially when evidence (and opinion) are contra-dictory or insufficient [39]. These techniques capture the
advantages of group decision-making while overcoming
biases associated with less structured group methods [42].Previous research suggests that these methods are the
most appropriate for our purposes [40], and are beneficial
to use in combination [49]. For example, the online Delphiprocess is a cost-effective way to involve a large number of
international and cross-disciplinary participants [47], and
it has been successful in previous guidelines [4,6,11,13].
If executed successfully, the outputs from this project
will help authors write clear reports, create a framework
for reviewers to assess publications, expedite fundingevaluations, provide a pedagogical tool for training stu-
dents and researchers in trial methodology, and help re-
search consumers evaluate RCT validity and applicability[50,51]. In these ways, the guideline aims to improve the
reporting quality of social and psychological intervention
RCTs and facilitate the efficient, effective transfer of re-search evidence into real-world use. We invite readers to
