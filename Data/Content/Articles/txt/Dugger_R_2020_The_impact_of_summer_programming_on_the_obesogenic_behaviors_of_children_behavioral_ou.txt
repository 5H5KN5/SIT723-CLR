Abstract
Background: Children from low-income families experience accelerated BMI gain and learning loss during summer.
Healthy Summer Learners (HSL) addresses accelerated BMI gain and academic learning loss during summer by
providing academic- and health-focused programming. This manuscript reports the effects of HSL on underlying
obesogenic behaviors (i.e., physical activity, screen time, sleep, diet) that lead to accelerated summer BMI gain, a
necessary first step to informing a future randomized controlled trial of HSL.
Methods: In the summer of 2018 and 2019 using a quasi-experimental study design, 180 children (90 per summer,
7.9 years [SD = 1.0], 94% non-Hispanic Black, 40% male) at two schools (i.e., one per summer) who were struggling
academically (25 –75% on a standardized reading test) were provided a free, school-based 6-week health- and
academic-focused summer program (i.e., HSL, n= 60), a 4- to 6-week academic-focused summer program (i.e., 21st
Century Summer Learning program (21C), n= 60), or no summer program ( n= 60). Children wore the Fitbit Charge
2™over a 10-week period during the summers (June –Aug) of 2018 –2019. Differences within (within child days
attend vs. not attend) and between (differences between groups attend vs. not attend) were evaluated using
mixed effects linear regression.
Results: Regression estimates indicated that, on days attending, HSL children experienced a greater reduction in
sedentary minutes ( −58.6 [95% CI = −92.7,−24.4]) and a greater increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) (36.2 [95% CI = 25.1, 47.3]) and steps (2799.2 [95% CI = 2114.2, 3484.2]) compared to 21C children. However,
both HSL and 21C children were more active (i.e., greater MVPA, total steps) and less sedentary (i.e., less sedentary
minutes and total screen time) and displayed better sleeping patterns (i.e., earlier and less variability in sleep onset
and offset) on days they attended than children in the control.

Conclusions: HSL produced greater changes in physical activity than 21C. However, attendance at either HSL or
21C leads to more healthy obesogenic behaviors. Based on the behavioral data in this pilot study, a larger trial may
be warranted. These results must be considered along with the pending primary outcomes (i.e., academics and BMI
z-score) of the HSL pilot to determine if a full-scale trial is warranted.

Background
The months of summer (i.e., June –August) have been
identified as a “double jeopardy ”of vulnerability for chil-
dren (5 –12 years) from low-income households in the
USA, in terms of both health and academic achievement.
Over 30 years of empirical evidence indicates that low-
income, minority children perform worse on standard-
ized tests than their same-age middle-to-upper-income
peers. This achievement gap is attributed almost entirely
to declines in academic proficiency experienced by low-
income children during the summer [ 1–4]. At the same
time, children ’s body mass index (BMI) gain accelerates
during summer [ 5–11]. Moreover, this excessive sum-
mer BMI gain is more pronounced for minority children
[6,8,11], who are more likely to come from socio-
economically disadvantaged families [ 12,13]. Recently,
our research team along with a local school district de-
signed Healthy Summer Learners (HSL) to address both
declines in academic proficiency and accelerated BMI
gain in one summer program. The component of HSL
targeting accelerated summer BMI gain is based on the
structured-days hypothesis (SDH).
The SDH suggests that the presence of structure, de-
fined as a pre-planned, segmented, and adult-supervised
environment, may regulate children ’s engagement in
obesogenic behaviors and can lead to maintenance of
BMI. For instance, during the school year, children
spend the majority of the day in a structured environ-
ment (i.e., school) which may beneficially impact their
obesogenic behaviors and in turn BMI [ 14]. However,
during the summer when children no longer have access
to school, their behaviors may deteriorate and corre-
sponding unhealthy changes in BMI may occur. Evi-
dence for the SDH is largely based upon studies which
compared weekdays (i.e., more structured because chil-
dren attend school) vs. weekend days (i.e., no school and
less structured) [ 14]. In fact, a recent systematic review
identified 190 studies that reported weekday (structured
days) and weekend (unstructured days) obesogenic be-
haviors in children during the school year [ 14]. Overall,
155 studies (82%) showed that children exhibited more
healthful behaviors during school weekdays when com-
pared to weekends. Specifically, the SDH posits that the
structure provided by the school day would impactchildren ’s physical activity, diet, sleep, and screen time
in a positive way. In terms of physical activity and screen
time, the SDH posits that the structured day limits chil-
dren ’s engagement in sedentary behaviors, such as
watching TV, playing video games, or engaging with mo-
bile screen devices (tablets, cellphones). Further, schools
provide planned (e.g., physical education, recess) and in-
cidental (e.g., transitions between lessons/classes) oppor-
tunities for children to be physically active. The SDH
also posits that children ’s sleeping patterns are regulated
by the engagement in structured days. Specifically, dur-
ing the school year, children must arrive at school at a
specific time. Thus, children ’s bed and wake times are
earlier and less variable than they would be on unstruc-
tured days. Finally, the SDH posits that on days with
greater amounts of structure, such as school days, that
the healthfulness of the foods available is regulated. The
foods served within schools are typically regulated by
federal, state, and/or organizational standards that dic-
tate the nutritional composition and quantity of foods
served. Conversely, on unstructured days, such as week-
end days during the school year, children are exposed to
environments, commonly the home, where less oversight
occurs, and children are able to select and consume less
healthful foods in larger quantities.
Similar to weekend days during the school year, sum-
mer vacation represents a window of vulnerability for
many children as the structure that the school day pro-
vides is removed. While few studies have examined chil-
dren ’s obesogenic behaviors during the school year
compared to the summer, those that have are consistent
with the SDH [ 15–18]. One intervention strategy to
mitigate increased engagement in unhealthy behaviors is
to provide children with access to structured program-
ming during the summer. We are aware of only one
study that has explored the impact of this approach on
children ’s obesogenic behaviors [ 19]. This study found
that on days that children attended a structured
academic-focused summer program they engaged in
healthier behaviors. For instance, on days when children
attended the program, they participated in approxi-
mately 11.3 additional minutes of moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) and 76.1 fewer minutes of
screen time compared to days they did not attend.Dugger et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:78 Page 2 of 15
However, this study was limited because the program
was not designed to impact children ’s obesogenic behav-
iors, it did not include a control group, and it had a
small sample ( n= 30). These limitations make it challen-
ging to estimate expected effects of a structured program
targeting health behaviors during the summer.
Although data demonstrates that academic-focused
summer programming can positively influence obeso-
genic behaviors, it is not clear if a health-focused sum-
mer program would produce additional benefits than a
structured academic program on children ’s obesogenic
behaviors. Additionally, because evidence for the SDH is
primarily based on studies that compare school days to
weekend days, it is imperative to explicitly test if this
theory can be generalized to summer programming.
Thus, the objectives of this manuscript are twofold; the
first objective is to assess the impact of providing access
to the novel HSL program on the obesogenic behaviors
of children compared to a pre-existing academic only
program (i.e., 21st Century Summer Learning program
[21C]). The second objective is to assess the impact of
providing access to HSL and 21C on children ’s obeso-
genic behaviors compared to no programming. Testing
if summer programming impacts the presumed behav-
ioral mechanisms underlying accelerated summer BMI
gain is a crucial step in order to understand the impact
of structure during summer and to guide optimization
of future intervention programs. Furthermore, this will
allow for the estimation of resources and the size of the
sample required for a planned, well-powered random-
ized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of HSL.
Based on the SDH, we hypothesize that:
Primary hypotheses
/C15Hypothesis 1 . On days when they attend a program,
children enrolled in a summer program (HSL or
21C) will engage in more beneficial levels of
obesogenic behaviors compared to children in the
control group.
/C15Hypothesis 2 . HSL will impact physical activity and
dietary outcomes to a greater degree than the 21C
program, while the impact on screen time and sleep
behaviors will be similar between programs.
Secondary hypotheses
/C15Hypothesis 3 . On days when they attend a program,
children will engage in more beneficial levels of
obesogenic behaviors compared to weekdays that
they do not attend.
/C15Hypothesis 4 .O nd a y sw h e nt h e ya t t e n da
program, children will engage in more beneficial
levels of obesogenic behaviors compared to the
weekend./C15Hypothesis 5 . On days when children do not attend
a program, all children will engage in similar
obesogenic behaviors compared to weekend days.
/C15Hypothesis 6 . On days when children in HSL or 21C
groups do not attend a summer program, they will
engage in similar obesogenic behaviors compared to
controls.
/C15Hypothesis 7 . There will be no group differences in
obesogenic behaviors on weekend days between
HSL, 21C, and no program.
Methods
Trial design
All procedures were approved by the lead author ’s uni-
versity institutional review board. This study was a
three-armed quasi-experimental study employing a re-
peated measure within and between participant design
comparing the HSL ( n= 60) to 21C ( n= 60) and no
program ( n= 60). HSL was designed to mitigate aca-
demic learning loss and accelerated summer BMI gain
by positively impacting children ’s obesogenic behaviors.
This paper presents the obesogenic behavior outcomes
from this pilot trial.
Participants
To distribute the costs of operating HSL, the study took
place over two summers (i.e., June –August, 2018 and
2019). A single elementary school in the Columbia, SC
metropolitan area, participated each summer (i.e., two
schools, one each summer). Schools were selected be-
cause they served children from low-income households
(100% free and reduced priced lunch) and they operated
a 21C summer program. Inclusion criteria were that
children were in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th grade and their
standardized reading score on the Measures of Aca-
demic Progress was between the 25th and the 75th per-
centile. Exclusion criteria was the presence of a severe
intellectual disability (e.g., fragile X syndrome, severe
autism). Measures of Academic Progress scores between
the 25th and the 75th percentile and the absence of a se-
vere intellectual disability were chosen as inclusion/ex-
clusion criteria because these are the criteria the school
district used to select children to participate in the 21C.
A total of 90 students participated each summer. A total
of 1281 student records were assessed for eligibility ( n=
617 in 2018 and n= 664 in 2019) via school records. Of
these 1281 students, 813 were not eligible to participate
because of their MAP reading scores ( n= 173) or they
were not in the 2nd –4th grade ( n= 640). The 408 eli-
gible children were recruited to participate in the study
via informational fliers and consent forms sent home
from school. A total of 269 families declined for their
child to participate and 199 returned a signed consent
form. A total of 180 children were randomly selected toDugger et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:78 Page 3 of 15
participate in the study. Of the 180 children, 60 were en-
rolled in the 21C program (i.e., n=3 0i n2 0 1 8a n d n=
30 in 2019). The remaining 120 (i.e., n=6 0i n2 0 1 8a n d
n= 60 in 2019) were randomly allocated to one of two
conditions HSL or control (no program) using a random
number generator.
Interventions
HSL was designed in partnership with the local school
district in which the study occurred. HSL was designed
to (1) address summer declines in reading achievement
and (2) mitigate accelerated unhealthy BMI gain during
the summer by positively impacting children ’s obeso-
genic behaviors. HSL operated at the participating
schools and was delivered by certified teachers. Partici-
pants enrolled in HSL attended daily (Monday –Thurs-
day, 8:00 –15:30) for 6 weeks during the summer, with a
1-week break in the middle of the program (i.e., 4th of
July). The program day consisted of alternating 60-min
periods of physical activity (3 total hours) with 1 h and
45-min periods of reading instruction (3.25 total hours).
All participants were provided a United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture (USDA) Summer Feeding Program
compliant breakfast (8:00 –8:30), lunch (12:30 –13:00),
and a healthy snack. The USDA Summer Feeding Pro-
gram mandates that foods align with the meal patterns
laid out by this program. For breakfast, this includes the
provision of both fruits and vegetables and whole grain
options and excluding sugar-sweetened milk beverages.
In addition, breakfasts cannot exceed 500 kcal, 10% kcal
from saturated fat, and 430 mg of sodium, and lunches
will not exceed 650 kcal, 10% kcal from saturated fat,
and 640 mg of sodium. Lunches are required to include
milk, fruits and/or vegetables, a grain, and a meat or
meat alternative. For snacks, the program could choose
two of the four components of the lunch guidelines and
had to include a fruit or vegetable. A 15-min nutrition
education session, based on the USDA Team Nutrition
Curriculum [ 20], was delivered by one of the teachers
each day during lunch. The USDA Team Nutrition Cur-
riculum focuses on eating a variety of low-fat foods and
incorporating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into
children ’s diets daily. Nutrition Education sessions typic-
ally consisted of a 5-min lesson by a certified teacher
followed by a 10-min activity session (e.g., activity sheets,
comic book readings).
The 21C is a federally funded program providing aca-
demic enrichment opportunities for students who attend
low-performing schools. Students enrolled in 21C
attended the same school as children enrolled in HSL.
The 21C operated daily (Monday –Thursday) from 8:30 –
14:00 for 4 weeks during the summer of 2018 and 6
weeks during the summer in 2019 at the participating
schools. The program day consisted of academic sessionsin the morning and afternoon (9:00 –11:30 and 12:30 –13:
45) and 1 h of physical activity before lunch (11:30 –12:
30). All participants were provided a USDA Summer
Feeding Program compliant breakfast (8:30 –9:00) and
lunch (11:30 –12:30). Children in the control group did
not attend either program.
Outcomes
Physical activity and sleep
Physical activity (steps, MVPA, sedentary time) and sleep
(total sleep duration, sleep onset, and sleep offset) were
measured using a Fitbit Charge 2TM(Fitbit Inc., San Fran-
cisco, CA, USA). Fitbit Charge 2TMdevices have demon-
strated initial reliability and validity for detecting heartrate
and sleep [ 21–23]. Each Fitbit was assigned a unique nu-
meric identifier, and each device was linked to Fitabase
(San Diego, CA, USA), a web-based interface that allows
remote access and download of participants ’second-level
Fitbit data. Children were asked to wear the Fitbit device
every day for the entire summer (i.e., 12 weeks) starting
the last week of school in the spring (May) until the first
week of school in fall (August). Parents were sent text re-
minders to sync and charge their child ’sF i t b i td e v i c ee v e r y
3–4 days. Only days with >10 h of waking wear [ 24]a n d
with step estimates between 1000 and 30,000 steps [ 25,
26] were considered valid. Data processing was informed
by the ISCOLE data processing protocols [ 24].
Consistent with previous studies [ 27–30], daily resting
heartrate for each child was distilled into activity inten-
sity levels by identifying the average of the lowest 10-
min beats-per-minute during wake time for each day.
Resting heartrates that were above the 95th (90 bpm) or
below the 5th (50 bpm) percentile were considered im-
plausible and replaced with the closest day that the child
had a plausible resting heartrate. Percent heart rate re-
serve (HRR) was calculated using the following formula:
heart rate −resting heart rate
maximum heart rate −resting heart rateand was used to determine
activity intensity levels, with 0.0 –19.9% of HRR consid-
ered sedentary, 20.0 –49.9% of HRR considered light
physical activity, and ≥50.0% considered MVPA [ 28,
29]. Maximum heart rate was defined as 197 beats per
minute for all children [ 31].
Sleep was identified and parsed from physical activ-
ity. Sleep onset was defined as the first minute that the
sleep episode began. Sleep offset was selected as the last
minute that a sleep episode was recorded. The sum of
the minutes that the Fitbit device classified a child as
asleep during a sleep episode was considered total sleep
time. Consistent with past research [ 32], the variability
in sleep onset and offset was represented by calculating
the standard deviation in sleep onset and offset for each
child. Only nocturnal sleep was considered for this study
and was defined as sleep onset that occurred between 5Dugger et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:78 Page 4 of 15
pm and 6 am and lasted for greater than 240 min [ 33].
Sleep segments separated by less than 20 min were con-
sidered one continuous sleep segment.
Screen time and diet
Parents completed the following measures through an
online survey that was texted to their smartphone twice
per week (i.e., one weekday and one weekend day) dur-
ing the 12-week period that children wore the Fitbit de-
vice and were encouraged to complete these measures
with their children to improve accuracy.
Parents were asked to estimate the total amount of
time (hours and minutes) their child spent in front of a
screen that day (e.g., TV, computer, video game, smart-
phone, and tablet) and the total amount of time spent
using screens after 20:00 h [ 34,35]. Parents reported on
screen time on both weekend and weekdays during the
program period (HSL = 6 weeks, 21C = 4 weeks).
Diet was assessed via a parent report food screener
[36]. Items were scored by four possible response
categories consiting of the following: 0 (child did not
consume), 1 (child consumed a little), 2 (child
consumed some), and 3 (child consumed a lot). Indi-
vidual food items were grouped in accordance with
the Healthy Meal Index (HMI) [ 37]. Food categories
included fruits, vegetables, dairy (non-sugar based),
convenience foods, sweets and desserts, and sugar-
sweetened beverages. Consumption was dichotomized
(i.e., “did”vs. “did not ”consume) and reported as
mean days/week [ 36]. Two variables were created for
analysis of diet: healthy foods/drinks (fruits, vegeta-
bles, and dairy) and unhealthy foods/drinks (conveni-
ence foods, and sweets/desserts, sugar-sweetened
beverages).
Sample size
Given the focus on hypothesis testing for this study, it is
essential to show the study is sufficiently powered to de-
tect differences when they exist between intervention
groups [ 38,39]. The above selection criteria yielded 60
children in each intervention arm. According to the stat-
istical software G*power 3.1.9.7, the study is sufficiently
powered to detect a difference between intervention
groups of d= 0.18 with a power = 80% and α= 0.05.
This is true for each obesogenic behavior outcome and
all hypotheses tested. The only previous study of which
we are aware that has examined the impact of structured
summer programming on obesogenic behaviors found
Cohen ’sdeffects of 0.21 (i.e., diet) to 0.78 (i.e., physical
activity) [ 19]. Based on this initial data, the current study
was determined to have adequate power to detect a sig-
nificant difference, should one exist.Randomization
Random assignment was completed by the last author
(RGW) who was not involved in data collection and was
completed each summer after participants enrolled in the
study using the runiform command in Stata (v14.2, Col-
lege Station, TX). Once implemented, randomization
could not be changed.
Data analysis
All analyses were completed in Stata (v14.2, College Station,
TX). Descriptive statistics of p rogram and child characteris-
tics and outcome variables were examined. Because observa-
tions were nested within child ren, violating the assumption
of independence, mixed effects linear regressions with days
nested within children were e stimated. A single model to
test all hypotheses was estimated for each obesogenic behav-
ior (i.e., sleep, sedentary, phy sical activity, diet). Each model
examined between program differences in behaviors (e.g.,
HSL vs. control) and the difference in behavior change be-
tween programs (e.g., HSL vs. 21C) by type of day (hypoth-
eses 1 and 2). Additionally, within-participant differences in
obesogenic behaviors on weekdays children attended a pro-
gram, weekdays children did not attend a program, weekend
days (hypotheses 3 –5), and between-group differences by
type of day (hypotheses 6 –7) were examined. Each model
included type of day (weekday attend program, weekday not
attend program, and weekend day), program (HSL, 21C, or
control), and program-×-type of day interactions as the in-
dependent variables and obesogenic behavior as the
dependent variable. All models included age, gender, and
year of participation (i.e., summer of 2018 or 2019) as covar-
iates. Robust standard errors were used using the “robust ”
command in STATA because the Breusch-Pagan test of
normality indicated that some of the models violated the as-
sumption of normally distributed residuals.
Consistent with past research [ 14,40], and hypothesis
testing theory stating that a set of related hypotheses
that provide consistent results strengthens causal infer-
ence [ 38], a coding system was adopted to explore the
hypotheses. Results that were statistically significant (de-
termined by a 95% confidence interval that did not cross
zero) and in the direction of the hypothesized relation-
ship as well as those that were not statistically signifi-
cantly different when there was a hypothesis suggesting
no difference should exist were classified as “Support. ”
Results that were not statistically significant despite a
hypothesis suggesting a mean difference were classified
as“Null. ”Results that were statistically significant but
contrary to the hypothesized relationship were classified
as“Conflict. ”

Behavioral outcomes by hypotheses
Hypothesis 1. On days when they attend a program, chil-
dren enrolled in a summer program (HSL or 21C) will
engage in more beneficial levels of obesogenic behaviors
compared to children in the control group.
Table 2presents the findings for the differences in be-
haviors between HSL vs. co ntrol and 21C vs control, on
days that children attended their respective programs. Con-

favorable levels of sedentary time, total steps, sleep onset,
sleep offset, sleep onset and offset variability, total screen
time, and unhealthy foods/drinks on days they attended
HSL when compared to control weekdays. Differences in
sleep duration, screen time after 20:00 h, and healthy foods/
drinks were not statistically si gnificant between children at-
tending HSL and the control group. Consistent with hy-
pothesis 1, children in 21C engaged in more favorable
levels of sedentary time, MVPA, total steps, sleep onset,
sleep offset, and sleep onset and offset variability on days
they attended 21C when compared to control weekdays.
There was no statistically significant difference in sleep dur-
ation, total screen time, screen time after 20:00 h, healthy
foods/drinks, and unhealthy foods/drinks between days
children attended 21C and the control group.
Hypothesis 2. HSL will impact physical activity and
dietary outcomes to a greater degree than the 21Cprogram, while the impact on screen time and sleep be-
haviors will be similar between programs.
Table 3presents the findings for the differential impact
of HSL when compared to 21C on children ’s obesogenic
behavior. Consistent with hypothesis 2, HSL had a greater
positive impact on children ’s sedentary time, MVPA, and
total steps than 21C. However, contrary to the hypothesis,
HSL did not have a greater positive impact on children ’s
consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods/drinks. Sleep
duration, sleep onset and offset, sleep onset and offset
variability, total screen time, and screen time after 20:00 h
were impacted similarly by HSL and 21C.
Hypothesis 3. On days when they attend a program, chil-
dren will engage in more beneficial levels of obesogenic be-
haviors compared to weekdays that they do not attend.
Table 4presents the results for hypothesis 3. In HSL,
consistent with the hypothesis, sedentary time, MVPA,
total steps, sleep onset and offset, sleep onset and offset
variability, total screen time, and unhealthy foods/drinks
were more favorable on days a child attended compared
to weekdays they did not attend. However, there was not
a statistically significant difference between days attend-
ing and weekdays not attending for sleep duration, total
screen time after 20:00 h, and healthy foods/drinks. Con-
trary to the hypothesis, total sleep time decreased on
days that children attended HSL compared to weekdays
they did not attend. In 21C, consistent with the hypoth-
esis, sedentary time, MVPA, total steps, sleep onset and
offset, sleep onset and offset variability, total screen time,
total screen time after 20:00 h, and unhealthy foods/
drinks were more favorable on days a child attended
compared to weekdays they did not attend. However,
there was no statistically significant difference between
days attending and weekdays not attending for healthy

time decreased on days that children attended 21C com-
pared to weekdays they did not attend.
Hypothesis 4. On days when they attend a program,
children will engage in more beneficial levels of obeso-
genic behaviors compared to the weekend.
Table 4also presents the findings for hypothesis 4. In
HSL, consistent with the hypothesis, sedentary time,
MVPA, sleep onset and offset, sleep onset and offset
variability, total screen time, and unhealthy foods/drinks
were more favorable on days a child attended compared
to weekend days. However, sleep duration, screen time
after 20:00 h, and healthy foods/drinks were not statisti-
cally significantly different on days a child attended com-
pared to weekend days. In 21C, consistent with the
hypotheses, differences in sedentary time, MVPA, total
steps, sleep onset and offset, and sleep onset and offset
variability were more favorable on days a child attended
compared to weekend days. However, total screen time,
screen time after 20:00 h, and healthy and unhealthy
foods/drinks were no different on days a child attended
compared to weekend days, and, contrary to the hypoth-
esis, sleep duration was more favorable on weekend days
compared to days a child attended 21C.Hypothesis 5. On weekdays when children do not at-
tend a program, all children (enrolled in a summer pro-
gram and not enrolled) will engage in similar obesogenic
behaviors compared to weekend days.
Table 4also presents the findings for hypothesis 5. In
HSL, MVPA, total steps, total sleep time, sleep onset
and offset, sleep onset and offset variability, total screen
time, screen time after 20:00 h, healthy foods/drinks, and
unhealthy foods/drinks were not statistically significantly
different and supported the hypothesis. Contrary to the
hypothesis, sedentary time was statistically significantly
greater on weekdays a child did not attend a program
compared to weekend days. In 21C, consistent with the
hypothesis, sedentary time, MVPA, total steps, total
sleep, sleep onset and offset, and sleep onset and offset
variability were not statistically significantly different on
weekdays that children did not attend 21C compared to
weekend days. However, contrary to the hypothesis, total
screen time, total screen time after 20:00 h, and healthy
and unhealthy foods/drinks were statistically significantly
different. In the control, all relationships supported the
research hypothesis.

ent with the hypothesis, on weekdays that children did
not attend HSL sedentary time, MVPA, sleep duration,
sleep offset, sleep onset and offset variability, total screen
time, screen time after 20:00 h, healthy foods/drinks, and
unhealthy foods/drinks were not statistically significantly
different from the control. However, contrary to the hy-
pothesis, total steps and sleep onset were statistically sig-
nificantly different between HSL and the control on
weekdays children did not attend.
When comparing 21C to the control and HSL to 21C, all
relationships supported hypo thesis 6 except sleep onset.
Hypothesis 7. There will be no group differences in obe-
sogenic behaviors on weekend days between HSL, 21C,
and no program.
Table 5also presents hypothesis 7. When comparing
weekend days between HSL to control, sedentary time,
MVPA, sleep duration, sleep onset variability, sleep off-
set, total screen time, screen time after 20:00 h, and
healthy and unhealthy foods/drinks supported the hy-
pothesis. However, total steps, sleep onset, and sleep off-
set variability conflicted with the hypothesis. When
comparing weekend days between 21C and control, sed-
entary, MVPA, total steps, sleep duration, sleep offset,sleep onset and offset variability, total screen time,
screen time after 20:00 h, and healthy and unhealthy
foods/drinks supported the hypothesis, while sleep onset
conflicted with the hypothesis. When comparing week-
end days between HSL and 21C sedentary time, MVPA,
total steps, sleep duration, sleep offset, sleep onset and

00 h, and healthy and unhealthy foods/drinks supported
the hypothesis, while sleep onset conflicted with the
hypothesis.
Finally, Table 6presents the total number of compari-
sons and the percent of comparisons that supported,
conflicted, or were null when considering the hypoth-
eses. Overall, 80.2% of the comparisons supported the
hypotheses, 11.5% were null, and 8.3% conflicted.
Discussion
This pilot study examined the impact of structured sum-
mer programming on the obesogenic behaviors of chil-
dren. Overall, the results indicate that providing children
with structured summer programming led to improve-
ments in obesogenic behaviors during the summer
months compared to children who were not provided
access. Specifically, on days when children attended a
program (i.e., HSL or 21C), they had more favorable pat-
terns of obesogenic behaviors compared to controls forTable 6 Comparisons classified as supporting, null, or conflicting the hypotheses

outcomes related to physical activity, sedentary behavior,
sleep, screen time, and diet. This study identified the be-
havioral mechanisms impacted by HSL and will inform a
future large-scale randomized trial.
Children who attended a program (i.e., HSL or 21C)
showed significant improvements in obesogenic behav-
iors compared to their own behavior on days they did
not attend the program (including both weekends and
weekdays). On days children attended a structured sum-
mer program, they accumulated more steps, more over-
all MVPA, and less sedentary behavior compared to
their own behavior on non-program days (either week-
ends or non-attended weekdays). These improvements
were more pronounced in the HSL group, whereas im-
provements associated with program attendance in the
domains of sleep, screen time, and diet were comparable
across the two interventions. This was expected given
that HSL was designed to provide additional opportun-
ities for physical activity and healthy eating when com-
pared to the 21C and neither HSL nor 21C explicitly
targeted sleep or screen time.
This study also showed that on program nights chil-
dren went to bed earlier and awoke earlier the next day,
potentially driven by the early start time for summer
programming. Similarly, children engaged in less screen
time on program days. Together, these findings indicate
that parents are more likely to enforce screen and bed-
time rules in preparation for an early rise the next day.
These findings are consistent with the literature that
children report less screen time on school weekdays
than the weekend [ 14], and evidence showing increased
screen usage during summer months compared to the
school year [ 15,19]. Thus, the structure afforded by
summer programming may have a beneficial impact on
pre-bedtime screen time, which can positively shape
sleep behaviors such as consistent bed/wake times and
improve sleep quality [ 41].
Results concerning sleep duration warrant attention.
Specifically, children obtained relatively less sleep on
program days, a result consistent with past research ex-
ploring sleep duration on school vs. weekend days [ 42]
or other school holidays [ 43]. Although a consistent link
has been established between short sleep duration and
risk for obesity in children [ 44], recent research regard-
ing sleep variability (in both duration and timing) ap-
pears to indicate that consistency, in addition to
duration, plays a role in obesogenic behavior patterns
and ultimately obesity risk. Therefore, it is not clear
whether the benefits of structure may outweigh the risks
associated with shortened sleep.
Although we expected diet would be affected by sum-
mer program attendance, this relationship was inconsist-
ent. The use of parental report and food frequency
questionnaires may not be sufficiently sensitive tocapture changes in children ’s diet between structured
and less structured days. Further, parents may not be
aware of what children are eating on days that they at-
tend a structured program. Although the current study
aimed to balance precision with increased participant
burden, a multiple pass 24-h dietary recall, the gold
standard of free-living dietary assessment [ 45] may be
necessary in future studies.
Structured days
Overall, the results largely support the SDH with chil-
dren engaging in more favorable obesogenic behaviors
on days that they attended a structured summer pro-
gram versus days they did not. Further, the finding that
children displayed similar obesogenic behaviors on days
that they did not attend a structured program further
supports the SDH hypothesis. These findings demon-
strate that increased access to structured summer pro-
gramming may be an effective strategy to mitigate the
obesogenic behaviors of children during the summer.
Structured summer programming offers children op-
portunities to engage in healthy behaviors and limits the
opportunity to engage in unhealthy behavior. Moreover,
consistent with the Theory of Expanded, Extended, and
Enhanced opportunities, HSL increased children ’s activ-
ity (MVPA, steps) and decreased sedentary time to a
greater degree than the 21C [ 46]. This is likely because
HSL provided 3 h of physical activity opportunities,
while 21C provided 1 h. Thus, it appears that the SDH is
a viable conceptual framework on which to base inter-
ventions targeting obesogenic behaviors in order to miti-
gate accelerated BMI gain during the summer.
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths. First, this study was
grounded in a theoretical framework: the SDH. Second,
the study was based on set of closely related hypotheses.
By testing a series of closely related hypotheses, causal in-
ference is strengthened [ 38]. Third, this study extends
existing evidence related to structured summer program-
ming as an intervention strategy for the mitigation of in-
creased engagement in obesogenic behaviors during
summer. Third, it captured obesogenic behaviors over an
extended period of time (12 weeks) and included objective
measurements of activity and sleep. Lastly, the inclusion
of a no contact control and academic-focused structured
program (i.e., 21C) as control groups is a strength.
This study also has several limitations. First, this study
used a relatively small sample size ( n= 90), and while chil-
dren were randomly assigned to HSL or no program, the
schools assigned children to the 21C. The lack of random
assignment to 21C could have led to unequal distribution
of measured and unmeasured confounders between the
intervention groups. Notably, the proportion of girls inDugger et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:78 Page 13 of 15
21C group is much lower than that in the HSL and no
program groups. Second, screen time and diet data were
collected via parent proxy-report, which may lead to po-
tential bias in the estimates. Third, the use of a consumer
wearable device could be considered a limitation. How-
ever, Fitbit has been shown to produce estimates of sleep
and heartrate that have good agreement with polysomno-
graphy assessment of sleep and electrocardiography as-
sessment of heartrate [ 21–23]. Fitbits were chosen for this
study to allow for extended wear periods during the
school year and summer. Additionally, the differential pro-
gram lengths (HSL = 6 weeks, 21C = 4 weeks first sum-
mer, and 6 weeks second summer) may confound the
observed findings and are acknowledged as a limitation of
the study. Finally, the use of a food frequency question-
naire is another limitation as it may not be sensitive
enough to capture changes in children ’s diet. Moreover,
parents may not have been aware of what their child ate
on camp days or weekends, which constitutes a limitation
on the survey ’s internal validity.
Conclusion
Providing children with structured programming during
the “critical window ”of summer may be a viable inter-
vention strategy to reduce children ’s engagement in obe-
sogenic behaviors and potentially mitigate unhealthy
BMI gain during the summer. Consistent with the SDH,
children engaged in more healthful behaviors on days
they attended a structured summer program. The find-
ings of this study warrant future investigation into the
impact of structured summer programming on chil-
dren ’s obesogenic behaviors. These results will be con-
sidered in concert with the academic and BMI z-score
findings from the HSL pilot trial to determine if a full-
scale trial is warranted.
