Abstract
Background: Fun For Wellness (FFW) is an online behavioral interv ention designed to promote growth in well-being
and physical activity by providing capabi lity-enhancing learning opportunities to participants. The conceptual framework
for the FFW intervention is guided by self-efficacy theory. E vidence has been provided for t he efficacy of FFW to promote
self-reported free-living physical well-being actions in ad ults who comply with the interv ention. The objective of this
manuscript is to describe the protocol for a feasibility study designed to address un certainties regarding the inclusion of
accelerometer-based assessment of free- living physical activity within the FFW online intervention among adults with
obesity in the United States of America (USA).
Method: The study design is a prospective, doubl e-blind, parallel group r andomized pilot trial. Thirty participants will be
randomly assigned to the FFW or usual care (UC) group to achieve a 1:1 group (i.e., FFW:UC) assignment. Recruitment of
participants is scheduled to begin on 29 April 2019 at a local bariatric services cente r within a major healthcare
organization in the Midwest of the USA. There are five eligibility criteria for participation in this study: (1)
between 18 and 64 years old, (2) a body mass index ≥25.00 kg/m2, (3) ability to access the online intervention,
(4) the absence of simultaneous enrollment in another intervention program promoting physical activity, and
(5) willingness to comply with instructions for physical activity monitoring. Eligibility verification and data
collection will be conducted online. Three waves of dat a will be collected over a 13-week period. Instruments
designed to measure demographic information, anthropo metric characteristics, ac ceptability and feasibility of
accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity, se lf-efficacy, and well-being will be included in the study.
Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics (e.g., recruitment rates), Pearson ’s correlation coefficient,
Bland-Altman analyses, and inferential statistical models under both an intent to treat approach and a complier
average causal effect approach.
Discussion: Results are intended to inform the preparation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial.
Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03906942 , registered 8 April 2019.
Trial funding: The Erwin and Barbara Mautner Charitable Fou ndation and the Michigan State University
College of Education.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
there are 650 million adults with obesity and that the
number of adults with obesity has tripled since 1975 [ 1].
Obesity is a risk factor for major non-communicable dis-
eases such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes,
musculoskeletal disorders, and some cancers [ 2]. To re-
d u c et h ep r e v a l e n c eo fa d u l t sw i t ho b e s i t y ,t h eW H O
recommends that individuals limit energy intake
from low-quality food sources (e.g., highly processed
foods high in fat), increase energy intake from
high-quality food sources (e.g., raw vegetables), and
engage in a recommended amount of physical activity
for health [ 1]. Examples of a recommended amount
of physical activity (counting only those physical ac-
tivities that you do for at least 10 min at a time) for
adults include at least 150 min per week of moderate
physical activity, at least 75 min per week of vigorous
physical activity, or an equivalent combination of the
two recommendations listed above [ 3,4]. There is
evidence, however, that very few (e.g., < 5%) adults
with obesity may engage in a recommended amount
of physical activity [ 5]. Fortunately, there also is evi-
dence that well-designed cognitive-behavioral inter-
ventions can successfully promote physical activity in
obese adults [ 6].
Self-efficacy theory
Self-efficacy theory resides within the more general
social cognitive theory [ 7]. In social cognitive theory,
individuals are regarded as proactive agents in the regu-
lation of their cognition, motivation, actions, and
emotions. Self-efficacy judgments occupy a central role
in self-efficacy theory and are defined as domain-specific
beliefs held by individuals about their ability to success-
fully execute differing levels of performance given
certain situational demands [ 8]. The formation of
self-efficacy beliefs is believed to rely upon the cognitive
processing of diverse sources of efficacy information that
can be categorized as follows: past performance accom-
plishments, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, and
physiological and/or emotional states. Two proposed
outcomes of self-efficacy beliefs are an individual ’s
thought patterns (e.g., goal setting, worry, and attribu-
tions) and behavior (e.g., challenges undertaken, effort
expended on challenges undertaken, and persistence in
the face of difficulties that arise during challenges
undertaken). A necessary co ndition for valid testing of
self-efficacy theory is concordance between the
domain-specific self-efficacy beliefs and the proposed
outcomes of the self-efficacy beliefs of interest [ 8].
There is a rich literature on the potential importance of
increasing self-efficacy for physical activity as a mech-
anism for promoting physical activity in adults [ 9,10].Physical activity
Physical activity has been defined as bodily movement pro-
duced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure
[11]. There is evidence that insufficient physical activity in-
creases the risk of several major non-communicable dis-
eases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and
some cancers) in adults worldwide [ 12]. Unfortunately, in-
sufficient physical activity in the adult population is a global
pandemic [ 13,14]. Successfully addressing this pandemic
will require ongoing and wide i mplementation of a variety
of intervention strategies (e.g., community-wide, informa-
tional, behavioral, social, policy, and built environment) at
multiple levels of society (e.g. , individual, neighborhood,
municipality, country) across the globe [ 15,16]. At the
individual-level, there is evid ence that behavi oral interven-
tions designed to promote physical activity by focusing on
personal psychological attribut es (e.g., self-efficacy beliefs)
can be effective [ 9,10]. Delivering a physical activity inter-
v e n t i o no n l i n eh a sb e e ns h o w nt ob ea ne f f e c t i v em o d eo f
delivery [ 17,18] that also may allow for efficient scaling up
of an intervention [ 16]. Thus, a readily scalable online be-
havioral intervention that effectively promotes physical ac-
tivity in adults with obesity by providing self-efficacy
enhancing opportunities may be useful in regard to
responding to a global pandemic ( i.e., physical inactivity) in
an at-risk population (i. e., adults with obesity).
Activity monitors
Wider use of activity monitors (e.g., pedometers and/or
accelerometers) to assess physical activity in field-based
research on adults began to be steadily advocated for
more than a decade ago [ 19–22]. A primary reason that
the use of activity monitors was advocated for was to ad-
dress long-standing concerns regarding potential limita-
tions for the validity of physical activity estimates based
on self-report [ 23–26]. Accelerometers generally were
recommended in field-based research when the indicator
of physical activity was to include a dimension of exer-
cise duration and/or intensity (e.g., time spent in moder-
ate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) and the cost of
the activity monitor was not prohibitive [ 19–22]. Recent
reports suggest that the use of accelerometers to assess
physical activity in field-based research on adults may be
increasing [ 27–29] .T h es c i e n t i f i ci m p o r t a n c eo ft h i s
trend is reinforced by troubling findings that suggest
only small to moderate relative agreement and large
absolute disagreement between estimates of physical
activity based on self-report versus accelerometry
[30]. Moreover, there is evidence that even some
commercial-grade accelerometers that are relatively
modest in cost can provide valid estimates of
free-living (i.e., occurring outside of controlled labora-
tory conditions) physical activity among adults [ 31].Myers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 2 of 18
The use of activity monitors in physical activity behav-
ioral interventions for adults with obesity has been rec-
ommended based on two key findings from a recent
meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
[32]. The first key finding was that physical activity
behavioral interventions with an activity monitor were
shown to increase physical activity in adults with obesity.
The second key finding was that it appears that adding
an activity monitor to an existing physical activity behav-
ioral intervention (previously without an activity moni-
tor) may increase the magnitude of the effect of the
intervention on physical activity in adults with obesity.
These two key findings, along with a synthesis of 14
relevant RCTs (11 of which were included in the afore-
mentioned meta-analysis), led the Community Prevent-
ive Services Task Force to recommend that physical
activity interventions for adults with obesity should in-
clude activity monitors and behavioral instructions (e.g.,
web-based education) [ 33]. Furthermore, the Commu-
nity Preventive Services Task Force recommends that
physical activity interventions for adults with obesity
should promote physical activity within a more broadly
focused weight management program where there is ac-
cess to a health care provider [ 33].
Feasibility
Assessing the feasibility of participants wearing an accel-
erometer as requested by the research team for a par-
ticular field-based study is recommended [ 21]. Two
large studies conducted in the United States of America
(USA) that assessed the feasibility of adult participants
wearing an accelerometer as instructed are the 2003 –
2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) [ 22] and the 2009 –2013 physical activity
ancillary study within the Reasons for Geographic and
Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study [ 34,35].
While both of these studies provide models for assessing
the feasibility of adult participants wearing an acceler-
ometer as requested by the research team, neither of
these studies was an online behavioral intervention. The
feasibility of participants wearing an accelerometer as re-
quested in a longitudinal online behavioral intervention
may pose unique challenges stemming from an inability
to hand deliver an accelerometer (as in the 2003 –2004
NHANES study) and the lack of an established
research-based relationship with participants (as in the
2009 –2013 physical activity ancillary REGARDS study).
Fun For Wellness (FFW)
FFW is an online behavioral intervention designed to
promote growth in well-being and physical activity by
providing capability-enhancing learning opportunities to
participants [ 36,37]. The conceptual framework for the
FFW intervention is guided by self-efficacy theory [ 8].The target audience of the FFW intervention is the adult
population who would be comfortable with the online
platform within which the intervention is delivered.
There is an emerging literature on the efficacy and the
effectiveness of the FFW intervention [ 36–39].
2015 FFW efficacy trial
A RCT completed in 2015, hereto forward referred to as
the 2015 FFW efficacy trial, provided the initial test of
the FFW intervention to promote well-being [ 36].
Figure 1depicts the conceptual model that guided the
2015 FFW efficacy trial. The FFW intervention (i.e.,
engagement with the BET I CAN challenges) was concep-
tualized as exerting both a positive direct effect and a posi-
tive indirect effect through sel f-efficacy (i.e., well-being
self-efficacy), on well-being (i.e., subjective well-being and
well-being actions). Each of the constructs depicted in Fig. 1
will be defined in the “Methods ”section of this manuscript.
Data collection for the 2015 FFW efficacy trial oc-
curred within a relatively controlled environment (i.e.,
adult employees at a major research university in the
USA). Results from the 2015 FFW efficacy trial pro-
vided some initial evidence for the efficacy of FFW to
promote well-being self-efficacy [ 38]; interpersonal,
community, psychological and economic subjective
well-being [ 36]; and interpersonal and physical
well-being actions [ 39] .T h ep r o t o c o lf o rt h ef e a s i b i l -
ity study to be described in this manuscript seeks to
follow up on the initial evidence provided in the 2015
FFW efficacy trial for the FFW intervention to pro-
mote self-reported free-living physical well-being ac-
tions (e.g., engagement in physical activity) in adults
who comply with the intervention [ 39].
2018 FFW effectiveness trial
A RCT designed to provide an initial evaluation of the
effectiveness of the FFW intervention to increase
well-being and free-living physical activity in an adult
population with obesity enrolled approximately 900 par-
ticipants and hereto forward is referred to as the 2018
FFW effectiveness trial [ 37]. Figure 2depicts the concep-
tual model that guided the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial.
The FFW intervention was conceptualized as exerting
both a positive direct effect and a positive indirect effect
through self-efficacy, on well-being and physical activity.
Four constructs —well-being actions self-efficacy, phys-
ical activity self-efficacy, self-efficacy to regulate physical
activity, and physical activity —were added to the
conceptual model in the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial
(i.e., compare Fig. 2to Fig. 1) based on the findings from
the 2015 FFW efficacy trial. Each of the additional con-
structs in Fig. 2will be defined in the “Methods ”section
of this manuscript.Myers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 3 of 18
The 2018 FFW effectiveness trial was built upon the
2015 FFW efficacy trial by having a stronger focus on
promoting physical activity and by recruiting partici-
pants from a relatively uncontrolled context (i.e., via an
online panel recruitment company) [ 37]. The increased
focus on physical activity in the 2018 FFW effectiveness
trial was manifest by a particular emphasis on engaging
in a recommended amount of physical activity for health
(i.e., time spent in MVPA) in the introduction to the
BET I CAN challenges. The 2018 FFW effectiveness trial
also was built upon the 2015 FFW efficacy trial by more
thoroughly assessing self-reported physical activity with
the long form (i.e., 27-items) of the international phys-
ical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) [ 40,41]. The afore-
mentioned long-standing concerns regarding potential
limitations for the validity of physical activity estimates
based on self-report, however, are relevant to both the
2015 FFW efficacy trial and the 2018 FFW effectiveness
trial. That is, neither the 2015 FFW efficacy trial nor the
2018 FFW effectiveness trial used objective instrumenta-
tion (e.g., accelerometry) to measure physical activity.
Proposed study
The feasibility study proposed in this paper will be the
first study to use accelerometry within the FFW onlinebehavioral intervention. The objective of this manuscript
is to describe the protocol for a feasibility study designed
to address uncertainties regarding the inclusion of
accelerometer-based assessment of free-living physical
activity within the FFW online intervention among
adults with obesity in the USA. Four specific aims will
be investigated.
Aim 1
To determine if accelerometer-based assessment of phys-
ical activity canbe used within the FFW intervention.
Aim 2
To determine if accelerometer-based assessment of phys-
ical activity should be used within the FFW intervention.
Aim 3
To determine how to implement accelerometer-based
assessment of physical activity within the FFW interven-
tion. Aim 3 assumes a positive response to Aim 2.
Aim 4
To provide a preliminary effect size estimate for each
direct effect depicted in the conceptual model (see
Fig. 1 The conceptual model that guided the 2015 Fun For Wellness efficacy trial [ 36]
Fig. 2 The conceptual model that guided the 2018 Fun For Wellness effectiveness trial [ 37]Myers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 4 of 18
Fig. 2) for the FFW online intervention (e.g.,
FFW→Physical Activity).
Pursuit of these four specific aims is based on a general
conceptual framework for feasibility and pilot studies in
preparation for a future definitive RCT [ 42–44]. Within this
conceptual framework, a randomized pilot trial is a type of
a feasibility study and a feasibility study may include a focus
on the acceptability of an intervention [ 42–44].
Methods/design
Ethical approval
All procedures in this study involving human partici-
pants will be in accordance with the ethical standards of
the institutional and/or national research committee and
with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amend-
ments or comparable ethical standards. The institutional
review board at Michigan State University provided ne-
cessary permission to conduct this study on 1 April
2019, STUDY00002012. Table 1provides the SPIRIT
flow diagram, which includes a list of the assessments to
be taken during the course of this study. A populated
SPIRIT checklist is provided in the Additional file 1.
Study design
The study design is a prospective, double-blind, parallel
group randomized pilot trial. Recruitment of participants
is scheduled to begin on 29 April 2019 at a local bariat-
ric services center, hereto forward referred to as the cen-
ter, within a major healthcare organization in the
Midwest of the USA. Eligibility verification and data col-
lection will be conducted online. Three waves of data
collection (i.e., at W1, W2, and W3) will be collected
over a 13-week period. Figure 3provides a flow chart for
recruitment of participants throughout data collection.
Instruments designed to measure demographic informa-
tion, anthropometric characteristics, acceptability and
feasibility of accelerometer-based assessment of physical
activity, self-efficacy, and well-being will be included in
the study.
Recruitment
Participants will be recruited from a relatively con-
trolled local context to allow for the possibility that
university-based researcher s (i.e., research staff) may
need to follow up with participants during the course
of the study to address unforeseen areas of uncertainty
that often arise during a feasibility study [ 41–43]. Pa-
tients who are candidates for bariatric surgery and are
enrolling in the preoperative weight management pro-
gram provided by the center will be recruited for pos-
sible participation in this study. Successful enrollment
in the preoperative weight management program pro-
vided by the center requires a medical history intakeand a physical exam (e.g., medical clearance to engage
in physical activity).
Recruitment for possible participation in this study
will be extended to each patient near the end of the wel-
come enrollment visit at the center. At this time, a
center staff member will provide the patient with login
information to the secure recruitment page on the FFW
website which can then be accessed by either a laptop
located in the center (and provided by the research staff)
or via their own device (e.g., smartphone). The patient
will then be asked to independently engage with the
FFW website in the waiting room. The center staff mem-
ber will, however, inform the patient that both they and
the research staff are available to respond to any questions
that may arise during recruitment and throughout the on-
line pilot study if necessary. Additionally, a member of the
research staff may be available in the waiting room (de-
pending on related scheduling issues) to assist the patient
with website and/or study-related questions. Research staff
will have regular contact with center staff throughout the
study to discuss any questions or concerns that may arise.
The recruitment page on the FFW website will pro-
vide a brief description of the study and will ask the
patient if they are interested in determining if they
are eligible for participation in the study. Response
options will include “yes”,“no”,a n d “not now, maybe
later ”(i.e., “defer ”) based on previous research [ 34].
Patients who select “no”will be invited to provide a
brief explanation for their response. Patients who
“defer ”will be invited to provide a brief explanation
for their response and then will be asked if they
would like to be contacted again in the future to dis-
cuss possible participation in this study. Patients who
select “no”or“defer ”will be taken to the exit page.
The exit page will thank an individual for their time
and ask them to check out with center staff. Patients
who select “yes”will be asked to create a unique and
secure login credential by providing a phone number
and an e-mail address and creating a password. Pa-
tients who select “yes”will also be asked if research
staff can send study-related text messages to the
phone number they provided. After the login creden-
tial is verified by the patient, the potential participant
will be screened to determine their eligibility for par-
ticipation in the study.
Eligibility
There are five eligibility criteria for participation in this
study. Values for each of the eligibility criteria will be
based on self-report by the potential participant. The
first two eligibility criteria focus on physical characteris-
tics of the potential participant. The first eligibility
criterion is being between 18 and 64 years old. A justifi-
cation for this criterion is that our target age-basedMyers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 5 of 18
population is adults (i.e., 18 –64 years) and not older
adults (i.e., 65 years and above) based on evidence-based
age groupings for global recommendations on physical
activity for health [ 3,4]. The second eligibility criterion is
a body mass index (BMI) ≥25.00 kg/m2. The BMI criter-
ion in this study includes overweight (i.e., 25.00 –29.99 kg/
m2)a n do b e s e( i . e . , ≥30.00 kg/m2) categories, consistent
with many physical activity interventions in adults with
obesity [ 6,32,33]. A justification for this criterion is the
need to promote physical activity in a BMI-based popula-
tion in which few individuals may meet public health
guidelines for physical activity [ 5].
The third and the fourth eligibility criteria focus on
the interaction of the potential participant and the on-
line intervention. The third eligibility criterion is the
ability to access the online intervention. This criterionwill be assessed by asking each individual to confirm
that they will have access to a technological device (e.g.,
computer, smartphone) that can access the online inter-
vention via a web browser throughout the study. The
fourth eligibility criterion is the absence of simultaneous
enrollment in another intervention program promoting
either well-being or physical activity. This criterion will
be assessed by requiring each individual to confirm that
they will not be enrolled in another formal intervention
program (not counting the pre-operative weight man-
agement program provided by the center) promoting ei-
ther well-being or physical activity during the FFW
study period. A justification for this criterion is a reduc-
tion in the likelihood of confounding the results from
the current study with results that may be due to enroll-
ment in other programs.Table 1 The SPIRIT flow diagram for the Fun For Wellness accelerometer feasibility study

The final eligibility criterion is a willingness to comply
with instructions for physical activity monitoring. This
criterion will be assessed by asking each potential par-
ticipant if they are willing to wear an adjustable nylon
belt around their waist with two accelerometers attached
to it for three 7-day intervals and complete a daily log
sheet regarding wear time during each of the three 7-day
intervals over a 13-week period. A justification for this
criterion is based on the physical activity ancillary
REGARDS study where a similar question was asked to
potential participants at screening [ 34]. Individuals who
indicate a willingness to comply with instructions for
physical activity monitoring will be asked to provide (a)
an estimate of their waist circumference for belt sizing
and (b) a mailing address where the physical activity
monitors can be sent. Individuals who do not meet one
or more of the eligibility criteria will be informed that
they are ineligible for the study at this time and then will
be taken to the exit page.
Informed consent
Potential participants who meet all of the eligibility criteria
will immediately be presented with the informed consentform to read and sign electronically. Individuals who click
“decline to consent ”will be locked out of the intervention
and will be taken to the exit page. Individuals who do not
respond will be taken to the exit page and subsequently
will be contacted by research staff and asked if they would
like to either “decline to consent ”or“consent ”.I n d i v i d u a l s
who click “consent ”will be informed that they are en-
rolled as a participant in this study.
Wave (W) 1 survey battery
Immediately after enrolling in this study, participants
will be taken to a new page to complete the W1 survey
battery. After completing the W1 survey battery, partici-
pants will be informed that a physical activity monitor-
ing package (PAMP) will be sent to their mailing address
within 1 week and then will be taken to the exit page.
The specific content of both the W1 survey battery (e.g.,
demographics) and the PAMP will be detailed in the
“Data collection ”section of this manuscript.
Sample size
Thirty participants will be targeted for enrollment in this
study. There are three rationales for the target sample
Fig. 3 Flow chart for recruitment of participants throughout data collectionMyers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 7 of 18
size. First, the target sample size fits well within the
range of sample sizes often observed in pilot and feasi-
bility trials [ 45]. Second, and with regard to aim 1
through aim 3 of this study, the target sample size is
consistent with sample sizes observed in similar research
[31,46–48]. Third, and with regard to Aim 4 of this
study, the target sample size is based on budgetary con-
straints and not a sample size determination for a de-
sired level of statistical power [ 42–44]. Budgetary
constraints preclude enrollment of more than 30 partici-
pants in this study.
Randomization
Following completion of the W1 survey battery, partici-
pants will be randomly assigned to either the FFW group
or the usual care (i.e., UC) group by the code programmed
within the FFW website that is specified to achieve a 1:1
group (i.e., nFFW=1 5 ,nUC= 15) assignment.
Participants, center staff, and research staff will be
blinded to participant group assignment.
Usual care
Participants assigned to the UC group (i.e., UC partici-
pants) will proceed through the preoperative weight
management program provided by the center. The login
credential for each UC participant will, however, provide
access to a secure website to complete data collection
(i.e., a survey battery and physical activity monitoring) at
W1, W2, and W3. UC participants will have the oppor-
tunity to receive up to $30 worth of Amazon electronic
gift cards, which is similar to previous research [ 36,37].
Specifically, UC participants will receive $10 for com-
pleting the W1 survey battery and W1 physical activity
monitoring, $10 for completing the W2 survey battery
and W2 physical activity monitoring, and $10 for com-
pleting the W3 survey battery and W3 physical activity
monitoring. UC participants will be given 4 weeks of 24
h access to the FFW online intervention approximately
1 month after data collection for this study is closed.
Fun For Wellness
Participants assigned to the FFW group (i.e., FFW par-
ticipants) will proceed through the preoperative program
provided by the center and will be given 4 weeks of 24 h
access to the FFW online intervention during data col-
lection for this study. The login credential for each FFW
participant will provide access to both the FFW inter-
vention and to a secure website to complete data collec-
tion at W1, W2, and W3. FFW participants will have the
opportunity to receive a total of up to $45 worth of
Amazon electronic gift cards, which is similar to previ-
ous research [ 36,37]. Specifically, FFW participants will
receive $10 for completing the W1 survey battery and
W1 physical activity monitoring; $25 for completing theW2 survey battery, W2 physical activity monitoring, and
at least 30 post-introductory BET I CAN challenges; and
$10 for completing the W3 survey battery and W3 phys-
ical activity monitoring. The remuneration plan at W2 is
linked to completing post-introductory BET I CAN chal-
lenges to encourage compliance with the FFW interven-
tion as suggested in previous research [ 36,37].
BET I CAN challenges
Self-efficacy theory [ 8] provided the theoretical frame-
work that guided the creation of capability-enhancing
learning opportunities (i.e., BET I CAN challenges) for
FFW participants to engage with. The
capability-enhancing learning opportunities provided to
participants come in the form of 152 interactive and
scenario-based challenges organized in the online envir-
onment by the BET I CAN acronym [ 36]. The beha-
vior-focused challenges are intended to increase a
participant ’s capabilities to set a goal and to create posi-
tive habits [ 49]. The emotion-focused challenges are
intended to increase a participant ’s capabilities to cope
with negative emotions and to cultivate positive emo-
tions [ 50]. The thought-focused challenges are intended
to increase a participant ’s capabilities to challenge nega-
tive assumptions and to create a new narrative for their
life [51]. The interaction-focused challenges are intended
to increase a participant ’s capabilities to communicate
and connect with others [ 52]. The context-focused chal-
lenges are intended to increase a participant ’s capabilities
to read cues and to change cues in the environment
[53]. The awareness-focused challenges are intended to
increase a participant ’s capabilities to know herself/him-
self and to know the issue [ 54]. The next step-focused
challenges are intended to increase a participant ’sc a p -
abilities to make a plan and to stick with a plan [ 55]. In
summary, the BET I CAN challenges in the FFW inter-
vention provide opportunities for a participant to in-
crease his or her capabilities to organize and execute
actions that may increase their well-being and physical
activity [ 36,37].
Data collection
Study timeline
Three waves of data will be collected over a 13-week
period (see Fig. 3), which is similar to both the 2015
FFW efficacy trial [ 36] and the 2018 FFW effectiveness
trial [ 37]. Data collection at W1 will include the W1 sur-
vey battery and W1 physical activity monitoring. The
W1 survey battery will be completed in week 1. The W1
physical activity monitoring will be completed in week 2.
Participants will return physical activity monitoring
items (to be detailed in the physical activity monitoring
section) to the research staff in week 3. The interventionMyers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 8 of 18
will be delivered in week 3 through week 6. Data collec-
tion at W2 will include the W2 survey battery and W2
physical activity monitoring. The W2 survey battery will
be completed in week 7. The W2 physical activity moni-
toring will be completed in week 8. Participants will re-
turn physical activity monitoring items to the research
staff in week 9. Data collection at W3 will include the
W3 survey battery and W3 physical activity monitoring.
The W3 survey battery will be completed in week 11.
The W3 physical activity monitoring will be completed
in week 12. Participants will return physical activity
monitoring items to the research staff in week 13.
The timeline for this study is similar to timelines
used in other physical activity interventions in adults
with obesity [ 6,32,33].
W1, W2, and W3 physical activity monitoring
Instruments designed to measure physical activity and
the acceptability and feasibility of accelerometer-based
assessment of physical activity will be included in the
PAMP. Research staff will prepare and send the PAMP
to each participant via regular USA mail approximately
1 week before physical activity monitoring is scheduled
to occur. A commercial-grade (Fitbit Zip) and a
research-grade (Actigraph wGT3X-BT) accelerometer
will be initialized and attached to an adjustable nylon
belt to measure physical activity objectively. The order
of the two monitors (i.e., which monitor is medial or
lateral) will be randomized to account for small differ-
ences by wear location. The same two monitors will be
provided to each participant at each time point to limit
inter-monitor variability. Throughout the study dur-
ation, no app, firmware, or software updates will be
a l l o w e da n do n el a p t o pc o m p u t e rw i l lb eu s e df o ra l l
monitors, to ensure consistent clock times for data ana-
lysis. The primary measure of physical activity in this
study will be the average minutes per day of MVPA
based on both widely accepted recommendations for
health-enhancing physical activity [ 3,4]a n dt h e
particular physical activity emphasis manifest in the
FFW intervention [ 37].
Consistent with previous research [ 34], a brief cover let-
ter, written and pictorial wear instructions, a daily log
sheet regarding wear time, protocol checklist, and one
preaddressed postage-paid, padded, return envelope (regu-
lar USA mail) will be included in the PAMP. In the cover
letter, participants will also be directed to use their login
credential to access electronic copies of the paper-based
documents in the PAMP. Wear instructions will include
the following: ensure that the belt is snug around the waist
and that monitors are placed over the right hipbone crest
at the anterior axillary line during wear time; begin to
wear the monitors upon awakening the day after receipt
for a seven-day interval; remove the monitors whensleeping or during water intensive activities (e.g., swim-
ming, bathing) and reattach the monitors upon awakening
or at cessation of water intensive activities; complete the
daily log sheet online with date and time the monitors are
put on and taken off each day; and return the monitors
and belt on the day after a 7-day interval via the pread-
dressed postage-paid, padded, return envelope provided.
On the day after a 7-day interval, participants will receive
a reminder by e-mail and/or phone to return the belt and
the monitors. At this time, participants will also be
prompted to complete instruments designed to measure
the acceptability of accelerometer-based assessment of
physical activity and self-reported physical activity.
Upon return of the belt and the monitors the research
team will follow a protocol based on previous research
[34]. Data will be downloaded using a standard universal
serial bus port. Belts will be laundered. Batteries in the
monitors will be charged or changed if necessary. Moni-
tors will be reinitialized for use. Within a few weeks of
the return of the monitors, participants who provide
usable data (to be described in the section on the Acti-
Graph wGT3X-BT) will be e-mailed (or mailed via
regular mail if an e-mail address is unavailable) a pre-
liminary estimate of their wear time and average
minutes per day of MVPA in relation to broad categor-
ies of recommended MVPA per week (i.e., 0 –4.21 min/
day = minimal; 4.21 –21.36 min/day = less than recom-
mended; ≥21.36 min/day = meeting recommendation of
150 min/week). Participants who do not provide usable
data will be informed that their average minutes per day
of MVPA cannot be estimated due to insufficient data.
Fitbit Zip
The Fitbit Zip (San Francisco, CA, USA) is a tri-axial
commercial-grade accelerometer that will be used to
measure physical activity objectively. There is evidence
for the validity of physical activity measures produced by
the Fitbit Zip in both treadmill-based [ 31,56] and
free-living [ 31] activities in adults. Average minutes per
day of MVPA will be determined using the Fitbit appli-
cation, which uses a proprietary algorithm to estimate
fairly active minutes andvery active minutes , consistent
with previous research [ 47,48].
The cost of a Fitbit Zip is approximately 60 USA dol-
lars. The Fitbit Zip can store data up to 7 days and sync
wirelessly with the Fitbit mobile application up to a 20-ft
range. A Fitbit website account will be established for
each Fitbit Zip, but a participant will not be able to ac-
cess the account [ 47]. The default settings of the Fitbit
Zip (e.g., goals) will be removed because these settings
may be inappropriate for adults with obesity [ 57]. Re-
moving these settings also reduces the likelihood of con-
founding effects from behavior change techniques built
into activity monitors [ 58]. The only physical activityMyers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 9 of 18
display that a participant will be able to view while wear-
ing this device will be the number of steps taken because
this information cannot be programmed to be hidden.
ActiGraph wGT3X-BT
The ActiGraph wGT3X-BT (Pensacola, FL, USA) is a
tri-axial research-grade accelerometer that will be used to
measure physical activity objectively. ActiGraph devices
have been used extensively as a reference (e.g.,
gold-standard) device to measure free-living physical activ-
ity objectively in adults [ 29]. Monitors will be initialized to
collect raw acceleration data at 30 Hz using ActiLife soft-
ware (version 6.13.3). Upon download, data will be
re-integrated to 60-s epochs, and non-wear time will be de-
fined as ≥90 continuous minutes of zero counts, with al-
lowance for 2 min of acceleration that are preceded and
followed by at least 30 min of continuous zeros [ 59]. Us-
able data will be defined as follows: (a) a log sheet with
a valid start date is submitted, (b) a monitor is worn for
at least 4 days (including one weekend day) with at least
10 h of valid wear time per day, and (c) no evidence of
monitor error (e.g., activity counts > 20,000 or lengthy
strings of repeated activity counts). Unusable data will
be treated as missing data. Average minutes per day of
MVPA will be calculated based on established cut
points (e.g., > 1952 counts per minute) [ 60].
The cost of an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT is approximately
225 USA dollars. The ActiGraph wGT3X-BT can store
data up to 43 days and sync wirelessly with the ActiLife
mobile application; however, the wireless function will
be disabled to maximize battery life. A participant will
not be able to view any physical activity displays while
wearing this device. The pairing of the ActiGraph
wGT3X-BT with the Fitbit Zip is based on previous re-
search where at least a moderately high correlation and
a moderate level of agreement between measures of
average minutes per day of MVPA produced by these
two accelerometers has been observed [ 47,48].
Acceptability
The acceptability of accelerometer-based assessment of
physical activity will be assessed with a modified version
of a questionnaire used in previous research [ 46,61].
The 11-item acceptability questionnaire used in this study
consists of a mix of both Likert-scale quantitative (6) and
open-ended qualitative (5) items. The first item assesses
relevant previous experience “Have you ever wore a phys-
ical activity monitor (e.g., Fitbit) to measure physical activ-
ity prior to enrolling in this study? ”, ___ no, ___ yes. The
next eight items are matched pairs where a quantitative
item is paired with a qualitative item to assess a particular
aspect of acceptability (i.e., instructions, acceptability of
wearing the belt, remembering to wear the belt,integration into daily routine). For example, the second
item is “the instructions included in the physical activity
monitoring package were easy to follow ”,1=s t r o n g l yd i s -
agree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly
agree. Whereas the third item is “If you selected disagree
or strongly disagree for the previous item, will you please
tell us why the instructions were difficult to follow? ”.T h e
penultimate item is “Would you be willing to wear the belt
again as a part of a new research study? ”,0 = n o ,1 =
maybe, 2 = yes. The final item is “What, if anything, would
you suggest that we change about how the belt is to be
worn in this research study? ”
Feasibility
The feasibility of accelerometer-based assessment of phys-
ical activity within the FFW online intervention will be
assessed with descriptive statistics, Pearson ’s correlation
coefficient, and Bland-Altman analyses. Descriptive statis-
tics will include recruitment rate, eligibility rate, consent
rate, participation rates, and retention rates. The mathem-
atical definition for each of these rates will be provided in
the“Data analysis ”section of this manuscript.
Self-reported physical activity
Self-reported physical activity will be measured with the
long form of the IPAQ [ 40,41]. The long form of the
IPAQ is intended for individuals from 15 to 69 years old
and purports to measure physical activity in four do-
mains —leisure time, domestic and gardening,
work-related, and transport-related —according to the
frequency and duration of the physical activity per-
formed in each domain during the previous week. The
physical activities measured are separated according to
their intensity, which is defined as a distinction between
walking, moderate physical activities, and vigorous phys-
ical activities. Moderate activities are those that cause a
small increase in respiratory frequency and require mod-
erate physical exertion, and vigorous activities cause
more breathing than normal, with hard physical exertion
[41]. Average minutes per day of MVPA will be calcu-
lated based on IPAQ data processing guidelines [ 62].
W1, W2, and W3 survey battery
Instruments designed to measure demographic informa-
tion, anthropometric characteristics, self-efficacy, and
well-being will be included in the survey battery. Data
on proposed demographic covariates of well-being
[63] and/or physical activity [ 9] will be collected in
the W1 survey battery and will include participant
gender, age, race, education-level, marital status, and
annual income. Residential zip code data will be col-
lected in the W1 survey battery as a proxy for a host
of built environment factors that may be related toMyers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 10 of 18
an individual ’s level of physical activity [ 9]. Anthropo-
metric data will be assessed in the W1 through the
W3 survey battery by asking each participant their
height and weight. Demographic, zip code, and an-
thropometric variables are collectively referred to as
covariates from this point forward.
Self-efficacy to comply
Participants will be asked to respond to the following
item in the W1 survey battery: How confident are you in
your current ability to get yourself to complete at least 30
Fun For Wellness post-introductory challenges within the
next four weeks? Thoughtfully completing 30
post-introductory Fun For Wellness challenges may take
approximately 4 h. A five category rating scale structure,
where 0 = no confidence, 1 = low confidence, 2 = mod-
erate confidence, 3 = high confidence and 4 = complete
confidence, will be implemented for this item, and in all
self-efficacy scales from this point forward, based on
previous research on effective self-efficacy rating scale
structures [ 64]. Asking participants at the onset of an
intervention to make a projection about their compli-
ance with the subsequent intervention is consistent with
previous research on compliance [ 65].
Well-being self-efficacy
Well-being self-efficacy has been defined as the extent
to which a person believes that they have the ability to
achieve a positive state of affairs in important areas of
their life [ 38]. Well-being self-efficacy will be measured
at W1 through W3 with the well-being self-efficacy scale
(WBSE scale) consistent with both the 2015 FFW
efficacy trial [ 36] and the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial
[37]. The 21-item WBSE scale purports to measure
seven dimensions of well-being self-efficacy: interper-
sonal, community, occupational, physical, psychological,
economic, and overall. Each of the seven dimensions of
well-being self-efficacy purported to be measured by the
WBSE scale has a unique item stem that references
three different time periods —past (i.e., 30 days ago),
present (i.e., right now), and future (i.e., 30 days from
now). Evidence for the validity and reliability of scores
derived from responses to the original shorter (i.e.,
7-item) version of the WBSE scale has been provided
[38]. Evidence for the validity and reliability of scores
derived from responses to the more recent 21-item ver-
sion of the WBSE scale, however, is not yet available
because the expanded version of the scale is being
piloted in the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial.
Well-being actions self-efficacy
Well-being actions self-efficacy has been defined as the
extent to which a person believes that they have the abil-
ity to take actions that may improve the state of affairsin important areas of their life [ 37]. Well-being actions
self-efficacy will be measured at W1 through W3 with
the well-being actions self-efficacy scale (WBASE scale)
consistent with the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial [ 37].
The WBASE scale purports to measure six dimensions of
well-being actions self-efficacy: interpersonal, community,
occupational, physical, psychological, and economic. Each
of the six dimensions of well-being actions self-efficacy
purported to be measured by the WBASE scale has three
items designed to measure it. Evidence for the validity and
reliability of scores derived from responses to the WBASE
scale is not yet available because the newly developed scale
is being piloted in the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial.
Physical activity self-efficacy
Physical activity self-efficacy will be measured at W1
through W3 with the physical activity self-efficacy scale
(PASE scale) consistent with the 2018 FFW effectiveness
trial [ 37]. The PASE scale is a modified version of the
exercise self-efficacy scale [ 66]. The PASE scale was tai-
lored for the FFW context to assess the extent to which
an individual believes that they have the ability to engage
in a recommended amount of weekly physical activity
for health. The PASE scale is concordant with the IPAQ
scale. Specifically, the 48-item PASE scale measures
weekly physical activity self-efficacy across four general
domains of life: leisure time, domestic and gardening,
work-related, and transport-related. Each of the four do-
mains has two unique stems (e.g., how confident are you
in your current ability to engage in leisure-related phys-
ical activity at a vigorous level of intensity) that reference
six increasing time periods (e.g., for at least 10 or 15 or
30 or 45 or 60 or 75 min in the next week). Evidence for
the validity and reliability of scores derived from re-
sponses to the PASE scale is not yet available because
the modified scale is being piloted in the 2018 FFW ef-
fectiveness trial.
Self-efficacy to regulate physical activity
Self-efficacy to regulate physical activity will be mea-
sured at W1 through W3 with the self-efficacy to regu-
late physical activity scale (SERPA scale) consistent with
the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial [ 37]. The 13-item
SERPA scale is a modified version of the barriers
self-efficacy scale [ 67]. The SERPA scale was tailored for
the FFW context to assess the extent to which an indi-
vidual believes that he or she has the ability to overcome
possible barriers to engagement in a recommended
amount of weekly physical activity for health. Evidence
for the validity and reliability of scores derived from
responses to the SERPA scale is not yet available because
the modified scale is being piloted in the 2018 FFW
effectiveness trial.Myers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 11 of 18
The reason for including both the SERPA scale and
the PASE scale is that the latter scale focuses on an indi-
vidual ’s beliefs in his or her ability to accomplish levels
of a task while the former scale focuses on an individ-
ual’s beliefs to overcome possible barriers to accomplish-
ing a task that he or she already knows how to do.
Self-efficacy theory [ 8] posits that a self-efficacy level
construct (e.g., physical activity self-efficacy) may play a
central role in the initiation of a behavior (e.g., engaging
in a recommended amount of weekly physical activity)
while a self-regulatory efficacy (e.g., self-efficacy to regu-
late physical activity) may play a central role in the
maintenance of a behavior (e.g., engaging in a recom-
mended amount of weekly physical activity over time).
The importance of both a self-efficacy level construct
and a self-regulatory efficacy construct has been demon-
strated in exercise contexts [ 66,67].
Subjective well-being
Subjective well-being has been defined as an individual ’s
satisfaction with the state of affairs in important areas of
their life [ 68]. Subjective well-being will be measured at
W 1t h r o u g hW 3w i t ht h e2 1 - i t e mIC O P P Es c a l e[ 68]c o n -
sistent with both the 2015 FFW efficacy trial [ 36]a n dt h e
2018 FFW effectiveness trial [ 37] .T h eIC O P P Es c a l ei s
concordant with the WBSE scale. Specifically, the seven di-
mensions of subjective well-being purported to be mea-
sured by the I COPPE scale —interpersonal, community,
occupational, physical, psych ological, economic, and over-
all—match the seven dimensions of well-being self-efficacy
that the WBSE scale was designed to measure. Each of the
seven dimensions of subjective well-being purported to be
measured by the I COPPE scale is measured with a unique
item stem that references three different time periods: past,
present, and future. Responses to each item follow an
11-category rating scale structure: from 0 ( worst your life
can be )t o1 0( best your life can be ). Evidence for the valid-
ity and reliability of scores derived from responses to the I
COPPE scale has been provided [ 36,68–70].
Well-being actions
The well-being actions construct has been defined as an
individual ’s actions that may improve the state of affairs
in important areas of their life [ 39]. Well-being actions
will be measured at W1 through W3 with the I COPPE
actions scale [ 71] consistent with both the 2015 FFW ef-
ficacy trial [ 36] and the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial
[37]. The 18-item I COPPE actions scale is concordant
with the WBASE scale. Specifically, the six dimensions
of well-being actions purported to be measured by the I
COPPE actions scale —interpersonal, community, occu-
pational, physical, psychological, and economic —match
the six dimensions of well-being actions self-efficacy that
the WBASE scale was designed to measure. Each of thesix dimensions of well-being actions purported to be
measured by the I COPPE actions scale has three items
designed to measure it. Responses to each item follow
a 7-category rating scale structure: from 0 ( never )t o
6(always ). Evidence for the validity and reliability of
scores derived from responses to the original shorter
(i.e., 12-item) version of the I COPPE actions scale
has been provided [ 39,71]. Evidence for the validity
and reliability of scores derived from responses to the
more recent 18-item version of the I COPPE actions
scale, however, is not yet available because the ex-
panded version of the scale is being piloted in the
2018 FFW effectiveness trial.
Data analysis
Data analyses will include both quantitative and qualita-
tive approaches. Quantitative analyses will be performed
in M plus 8.0 under maximum-likelihood estimation with
robust standard errors [ 72]. Missing data will be handled
with the default approach under the assumption that
data are missing at random [ 73]. When an estimate of a
population parameter (e.g., mean difference) is sought,
estimation of a 95% confidence interval (CI) will also be
sought. When a qualitative approach is taken (e.g.,
responses to an open-ended acceptability item; feedback
from the center staff), feedback will be summarized
based on themes that emerge from the research team ’s
analysis of the feedback. The particular quantitative and/
or qualitative methods that will be used to evaluate each
specific aim will vary as a function of the focus of the
specific aim.
A traffic light system will be used to evaluate results of
specific indicators within each specific aim and with re-
gard to the feasibility of a future definitive RCT [ 43].
Data observed below a lower threshold (i.e., red light)
will indicate a potentially serious problem. Data ob-
served above a lower threshold but below an upper
threshold (i.e., yellow light) will indicate that caution is
warranted. Data observed above an upper threshold (i.e.,
green light) will indicate support for the feasibility of a
future definitive RCT. The particular threshold values
that define the traffic light system will vary by the spe-
cific indicator within each specific aim (see Table 2).
Aim 1
Descriptive statistics will be used to determine if
accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity canbe
used within the FFW intervention. Threshold values for
the traffic light system for each of the specific indicators
that will be used to evaluate aim 1 are based on inferences
drawn from the results of previous research [ 22,34,46].
Acceptability Percentage of responses observed in agree
or strongly agree to each of the four Likert-scale itemsMyers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 12 of 18
designed to assess acceptability will be calculated at
wave W, where W= W1 or W2 or W3. The lower bound
threshold is < 60%. The upper bound threshold is ≥80%.
Recruitment rate Recruitment rate will be defined as
the percentage of patients who select “yes”when asked if
they are interested in determining if they are eligible for
participation in this study: ( ninterested /[ninterested +nno+
ndefer]) × 100. The lower bound threshold is < 40%. The
upper bound threshold is ≥60%.
Eligibility rate Eligibility rate will be defined as the per-
centage of interested patients who are presented with
the informed consent form: ( neligible /ninterested ) × 100.
The lower bound threshold is < 60%. The upper bound
threshold is ≥80%.
Consent rate Consent rate will be defined as the per-
centage of eligible patients who consent to participate in
this study: ( nconsent /neligible ) × 100. The lower bound
threshold is < 80%. The upper bound threshold is ≥90%.
Participation rates Participation rate at wave W, where
W= W1 or W2 or W3, will be defined as the percentage
of consented patients who provide usable data at wave
W:(nusable data at wave W/nconsent ) × 100. The lower bound
threshold is < 50%. The upper bound threshold is ≥70%.
The definition of usable data will follow the description
previously provided in the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT section.
Retention rates Retention rate through wave W, where
W= W2 or W3, will be defined as the percentage of
consented patients who provide usable data at W1
through wave W:(nusable data through wave W /nconsent )×
100. The lower bound threshold is < 40%. The upper
bound threshold is ≥60%. The definition of usable data
will follow the description previously provided in the
ActiGraph wGT3X-BT section.
Aim 2
Pearson ’s correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman ana-
lyses will be used to determine if accelerometer-based
assessment of physical activity should be used within the
FFW intervention. Threshold values for the traffic light
system for the specific indicators that will be used to
evaluate aim 2 are based on inferences drawn from the
results of previous research [ 47,48].
Pearson ’s correlation The linear relationship between
the estimates of average minutes per day of MVPA at
wave W, where W= W1 or W2 or W3, produced by the
ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, the Fitbit Zip, and the IPAQ, will
be estimated with Pearson ’s correlation [ 74]. The lowerbound threshold is < .60. The upper bound threshold is
≥.70.
Bland-Altman analyses Agreement between the esti-
mates of average minutes per day of MVPA at wave W,
where W= W1 or W2 or W3, produced by the Acti-
Graph wGT3X-BT, the Fitbit Zip, and the IPAQ, will be
evaluated with Bland-Altman analyses [ 75]. First, to test
for a systematic difference between pairs of estimates
and zero at wave W,ap a i r e d ttest will be conducted.
Second, to test for proportional bias at wave W,al i n e a r
regression will be conducted where the difference be-
tween pairs of estimates will be regressed on the mean
of the two estimates. Third, the Bland-Altman plot will
be constructed at wave W, where the difference be-
tween pairs of estimates is represented on the y-axis,
the mean of the two estimates is represented on the
x-axis, and three horizontal lines are depicted with re-
gard to the y-axis: M+ 2SD, M,M−2SD. The traffic
light system will be based on the Bland-Altman plot
and not on a result from a hypothesis test [ 42–44]. The
lower bound threshold is > 10% of observations beyond
M± 2SD. The upper bound threshold is ≤5% of obser-
vations beyond M± 2SD.Table 2 Lower and upper bound threshold values that define

Aim 3
A descriptive statistic and qualitative data will be used to
determine how to implement accelerometer-based assess-
ment of physical activity within the FFW intervention.
Threshold values for the traffic light system for the
specific indicators that will be used to evaluate aim 3
are based on inferences drawn from the results of
previous research [ 46].
Acceptability: quantitative Percentage of responses ob-
served in “yes”to the following item —“Would you be
willing to wear the belt again as a part of a new research
study? ”will be calculated at wave W, where W=W 1 o r
W2 or W3. The lower bound threshold is < 75%. The
upper bound threshold is ≥85%.
Acceptability: qualitative Themes that emerge from re-
sponses to the five qualitative items designed to assess
acceptability will be analyzed at wave W, where W=W 1
or W2 or W3. Possible improvements will be considered
with regard to the protocol for accelerometer-based as-
sessment of free-living physical activity within the FFW
online intervention among adults with obesity in the
USA. Specifically, improvements will be considered with
regard to instructions for wearing the belt, acceptability
of wearing of the belt, remembering to wear the belt, in-
tegration of wearing the belt into the daily routine, and
why some participants may be unwilling to wear the belt
as a part of new research study. The lower bound
threshold is the presence of at least one potentially ser-
ious problem with the accelerometer-based protocol that
is unable to be addressed in a future study. The upper
bound threshold is the absence of a potentially serious
problem with the accelerometer-based protocol that is
unable to be addressed in a future study.
Aim 4
Inferential statistical models under both an intent to
treat (ITT) approach and a complier average causal ef-
fect (CACE) approach will be used to provide a prelim-
inary effect size estimate for each direct effect depicted
in the conceptual model (see Fig. 2) for the FFW online
intervention (e.g., FFW →Physical Activity) at wave W,
where W = W2 or W3. Using both an ITT approach and
a CACE approach is consistent with data analyses from
the 2015 FFW efficacy trial [ 36,38,39] and with the data
analysis plan for the 2018 FFW effectiveness trial [ 37].
Covariates, the outcome at W1, and group assignment
will be specified as predictors in both approaches.
Threshold values for the traffic light system for the spe-
cific indicators that will be used to evaluate aim 4 are
based on commonly used heuristics for Cohen ’sd[76].ITT The ITT approach will estimate each direct effect
of being assigned to the FFW intervention at wave W,
where Wcan equal W2 or W3 [ 77]. The lower bound
threshold is < 0.00. The upper bound threshold is ≥0.20.
CACE The CACE approach will estimate each direct ef-
fect of complying with the FFW intervention [ 78–81].
The lower bound threshold is < 0.00. The upper bound
threshold is ≥0.20.
Indirect effects At this time, we do not plan to provide
a preliminary effect size estimate for the indirect effects
of FFW online intervention depicted in the conceptual
model (see Fig. 2) for the FFW online intervention (e.g.,
FFW→Physical Activity Self-Efficacy →Physical Activ-
ity) due to a methodological limitation. Specifically, we
are unaware of any published methodological work on
the estimation of an indirect effect and its standard error
within the CACE framework. For this reason, the general
data analytic approach taken (or planned to be taken) in
both the 2015 FFW efficacy trial [ 36,38,39] and the
2018 FFW effectiveness trial has been to first evaluate
evidence for each direct (or equivalently, overall) effect
before possibly investigating evidence for the possible
decomposition of an overall effect into indirect and dir-
ect effects [ 82] in the future should relevant methodo-
logical advancements become available.
Discussion
FFW is an online behavioral intervention designed to
promote growth in well-being and physical activity by
providing capability-enhancing learning opportunities to
participants. The objective of this manuscript is to describe
the protocol for a feasibility study designed to address un-
certainties regarding the inclusion of accelerometer-based
assessment of free-living physical activity within the FFW
intervention among adults with obesity in the USA. The
protocol described in this paper logically builds upon both
the 2015 FFW efficacy trial [ 36] and the 2018 FFW effect-
iveness trial [ 37]. Results from the feasibility study de-
scribed in this paper are intended to inform the preparation
of a future definitive RCT. Like the protocol for every feasi-
bility study, however, the protocol for the feasibility study
described in this paper has both strengths and weaknesses.
We are aware of at least four notable strengths for the
feasibility study described in this paper. First, the study
described in this paper seeks to address a major limita-
tion found in both the 2015 FFW efficacy trial and the
2018 FFW effectiveness trial: measurement of physical
activity via self-report only. We believe that providing
some initial evidence for the feasibility of including
accelerometer-based assessment of physical activity
within FFW may be an important next step in the con-
tinual development of the intervention, particularlyMyers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 14 of 18
given recent findings that suggest less than high agree-
ment between estimates of physical activity based on
self-report versus accelerometer-based [ 30]. Second, the
feasibility study described in this paper attempts to build
an evidence-based foundation for a specific response to
a global need for readily scalable online behavioral inter-
ventions that effectively promote physical activity in
adults [ 16]. We believe that the FFW online behavioral
intervention may have the potential to eventually be-
come useful, in some small but important way given the
magnitude of the problem, in responding to the global
pandemic of physical inactivity [ 13,14]. Third, the feasi-
bility study described in this paper attempts to build an
evidence-based foundation for a specific response to the
troubling global trend toward obesity [ 1]. We believe
that the FFW intervention, because of its conceptual
basis in self-efficacy theory, may be effective in promot-
ing physical activity in obese adults [ 6,32,33]. Finally,
the feasibility study described in this paper aligns well
with recent recommendations put forth by the Commu-
nity Preventive Services Task Force [ 33]. More specific-
ally, the feasibility study described in this paper proposes
a physical activity intervention for adults with obesity
(i.e., FFW) that includes activity monitors (i.e., acceler-
ometers) and promotes physical activity within a more
broadly focused weight management program where
there is access to a health care provider (i.e., at a local
bariatric service center within a major healthcare
organization in the Midwest of the USA).
We are aware of at least three notable limitations for
the feasibility study described in this paper. The first
limitation is that recruitment of participants is to occur
within a relatively controlled local context. While
recruiting participants at a local bariatric service center
within a major healthcare organization in the Midwest
of the USA will afford the research staff the opportunity
to follow up with both center staff and participants dur-
ing the course of the study to address unforeseen areas
of uncertainty, it also may limit the generalizability of
the results of the study [ 42–44]. Future research that
evaluates the feasibility of accelerometer-based assess-
ment of physical activity within the FFW online behav-
ioral intervention in a less controlled context (e.g., an
online survey panel company) may be worthwhile given
the scientific utility of evaluating interventions in a var-
iety of contexts [ 83].
The second limitation is that each participant in this
study will be determined to be eligible for this study
based on values provided by self-report. For some eligi-
bility criteria this limitation may be regarded as relatively
minor due to a structural characteristic of the study de-
sign. For instance, the eligibility criterion that BMI ≥
25.00 kg/m2should be truly met (at least at baseline) be-
cause enrollment in the preoperative weightmanagement program provided by the center (from
which participants in this study will be recruited) re-
quires BMI ≥35.00 kg/m2or≥40.00 kg/m2depending
on other health indicators. Similarly, the eligibility criter-
ion that a participant has the ability to access the online
intervention may be viewed as reasonably likely to be
truly met in at least most cases for a couple of reasons.
First, the Pew Research Center estimates that more than
three quarters of the adult population in the USA cur-
rently own a smartphone [ 84], a device that should be
able to access the online activities that will occur in this
study. Second, the login credential verification that occurs
at the end of the recruitment phase of this study requires
a participant to respond to a message sent to the e-mail
account provided (i.e., establishing an online communica-
tion pathway) before proceeding to the eligibility deter-
mination phase of this study. Finally, the eligibility
criterion that a participant communicates an honest will-
ingness to comply with instructions for physical activity
monitoring may be viewed as likely to be met in at least
most cases for a couple of reasons. First, the compliance
rates for observed in studies with similar physical activity
monitoring protocols, such as the 2003 –2004 NHANES
study [ 22] and the REGARDS study [ 34], generally were
quite high. Second, the accelerometer devices will provide
objective indicators (e.g., wear time) of the observed com-
pliance with the instructions for physical activity monitor-
ing. For two eligibility criteria (i.e., age and the absence of
simultaneous enrollment in another intervention program
promoting either well-being or physical activity), however,
this self-report-based limitation should be regarded as po-
tentially more problematic due to the absence of a struc-
tural characteristic in the study design that guards against
the provision of false information. Most generally, a limi-
tation of this study is that it is possible one or more partic-
ipants in this study may provide false information that
leads to an incorrect decision regarding their true eligibil-
ity for enrollment in this study.
The third limitation deals with some uncertainty re-
garding the qualitative approach taken in aim 3. While
the qualitative approach taken in aim 3 to assess the ac-
ceptability of accelerometry within the FFW intervention
(i.e., open-ended questions) represents an extension of a
more quantitatively focused questionnaire used in previ-
ous research [ 46,61], it may still fail to capture at least
some important information that a more rigorous quali-
tative approach (e.g., in-depth interviews) may provide.
If the qualitative approach taken in aim 3 of this study
fails to provide adequate information to reasonably
assess the acceptability of accelerometry within the FFW
intervention, then subsequent research may need to
dedicate more resources (e.g., staffing to conduct in-
depth interviews) to support a more rigorous qualitative
approach to more fully investigate aim 3.Myers et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:73 Page 15 of 18
