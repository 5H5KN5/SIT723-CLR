Objective : To reanalyse a web-based intervention for physically untrained of ﬁce
workers with sub-acute non-speci ﬁc low back pain in low back pain-related exercise
behaviour terms. Design : Reanalysis of a randomized controlled trial. Setting : Occu-
pational Preventive Medicine of University. Methods : Participants were randomized
to an intervention group (proposed intervention plus standard care) or a controlgroup (usual care only). The intervention exercise and education materials were
developed as an online resource, and included video demonstrations recorded in a
laboratory. Resources were loaded onto a dedicated section of the University Preven-tive Medicine Service website. All sessions included stretching, and exercises to
improve postural stability (abdominal, lumbar, hip and thigh muscles) strength, ﬂexi-
bility and mobility. Outcome measures were self-reported health status (visual ana-logue scale (VAS) of the Euroquol-5D questionnaire); functional health status(Oswestry disability questionnaire); and the stage of change questionnaire. At
nine months, outcomes in the intervention group were analysed and compared with
baseline and outcomes in controls. Results : In the intervention group, signi ﬁcant
positive effects were observed at nine-month follow up for stage of change in thebehavioural domain as related with low back pain for all phases except for the con-
templation phase. The positive change in the stage of change questionnaire corre-
lated with the improvement observed in Oswestry ( r= .388) and VAS ( r=/C0.612).
Conclusions : The reanalysis of the trial suggests that exercise behaviour related to
low back pain improve after the intervention period. This improvement correlates
with changes in clinical low back pain-related outcomes.

Introduction
Physical inactivity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovas-
cular disease in the general population (Fogelholm, 2010). In of ﬁce workers, physical
inactivity was shown to have a negative impact on health (Wilkerson, Boer, Smith, &Heath, 2008). The physically inactive nature of of ﬁce work predisposes workers to mus-
culoskeletal disorders such as low back pain (LBP) and discomfort (Macedo, Trindade,Brito, & Socorro Dantas, 2011). This impacts on the quality of life of the affected indi-

viduals (Payne, Gledhill, Katzmarzyk, & Jamnik, 2000), and on their ability to perform
tasks of daily living (Kovacs, Abraira, Zamora, & Fernandez, 2005; van der Roer, Ostel-o, Bekkering, van Tulder, & de Vet, 2006). Therefore, effective interventions to promotean active lifestyle and physical activity among high-risk groups and the general popula-
tion are warranted (Hodgins, Battel-Kirk, & Asgeirsdottir, 2010). As well as evaluating
the clinical outcome of workplace health promotion programmes in special populations,it is necessary to evaluate outcomes such as exercise-related behaviour. Within the con-text of health promotion, the transtheoretical model is a standard model used to assessthe effectiveness of physical activity interventions in terms of change in the behaviourdimension. This model has been largely used for physical activity promotion (Hutchisonet al., 2009).
Traditionally, business and public of ﬁce managers have tended to focus on produc-
tivity, and have attributed little importance to the health of employees. However, major
absenteeism due to work-related diseases has led to increased attention to this issue(Macedo et al., 2011). Furthermore, several studies show the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health promotion programmes in the workplace (Cho, Kang, Park,Paek, & Choi, 2009; Logan, Milne, Achber, Campbell, & Haynes, 1981; MacKinnonet al., 2010; Poole, Kumpfer, & Pett, 2001; Robroek, Bredt, & Burdorf, 2007).Research suggests that exercise programmes of short duration are most appropriate foremployees who work long shifts (Bell and Burnett, 2009).
The internet and email are promising media for the delivery of health information
and health promotion programmes. The internet is useful for providing health informa-tion to large speci ﬁc populations (Napolitano and Marcus, 2002; Wanner Martin-Diener,
Braun-Fahrlander, Bauer, & Martin, 2009; Yap, Hemmings, & Davis, 2009). Use of theinternet and email is increasing among the work-age adult population (Napolitano et al.,2003). Research suggests that the internet is becoming the preferred method of obtain-ing health information in both the general population (Fotheringham, Wonnacott, &Owen, 2000) and speci ﬁc populations (McKay, Feil, Glasgow, & Brown, 1998). Fur-
thermore, the internet enables low-cost and wide dissemination of interventions (de
Vries and Brug, 1999). We, therefore, consider the internet a potential channel for deliv-ering a worksite health promotion intervention to speci ﬁc populations.
Several studies in the general population have evaluated web-based workplace
health promotion interventions aimed at improving self-reported health status, promot-ing a healthy lifestyle or improving lifestyle behaviour (Colkesen, Ferket et al., 2011;Colkesen, Niessen et al., 2011; Perez, Phillips, Cornell, Mays, & Adams, 2009). Somestudies have used an email reminder to improve patient ’s adherence (Lenert, Munoz,
Perez, & Bansod, 2004; Plotnikoff, McCargar, Wilson, & Loucaides, 2005; Yap et al.,
2009). However, the effectiveness of such interventions in special populations is not yetestablished. Within this context, our group developed a new trial of nine months ofweb-based multidisciplinary programme, including exercise and postural education. Inan initial report from this 36-week trial, we concluded that the intervention was effec-tive to clinically improve the HRQoL, risk of chronicity and functional disability inpatients with non-speci ﬁc low back pain (Del Pozo-Cruz, Adsuar et al., 2012; Del
Pozo-Cruz, Gusi et al., 2012; Del Pozo-Cruz, Parraca et al., 2012). To broaden this
knowledge, the present analysis aims to provide further understanding of the effects of
this intervention in two possible ways: Firstly, by analysing the feasibility and safety ofnine months of our web-based intervention to induce additional bene ﬁts by improving
the exercise-related behaviour related to improving LBP; and secondly, to test if thisimprovement correlated with the improvement of functional disability and self-reported688 B. del Pozo-Cruz et al.
health status as clinical outcomes for low back pain patients. This latter knowledge will
allow researchers and clinicians to better characterize changes induced by this interven-tion. Within this new analysis, we hypothesized that our intervention is also effective toimprove LBP-related exercise behaviour and that this improvement correlates with the
speciﬁcs outcomes of the disease.
Methods
The method for this trial has been reported previously elsewhere (Del Pozo-Cruz, Adsuar
et al. 2012; Del Pozo-Cruz, Gusi et al. 2012; Del Pozo-Cruz, Parraca et al. 2012). A sin-gle-blind randomized controlled trial was performed (ISRCTN40949689). Figure 1 showstheﬂow of participants through the study. The study population was recruited from the
four administrative of ﬁces of the University of Extremadura in Southern Spain. To ensure
correct implementation, a manual describing the study protocol was produced and made
available to all study researchers. Prior to the commencement of the study, two techni-cians received two-week training in all aspects of the study protocol. The study was per-formed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000 in Edinburgh,and was approved by the research ethics committee of the University of Extremadura.

Participants
Participants were recruited via the University Preventive Medicine Service. An adver-
tisement alerted potential participants to the project. Sub-acute non-speci ﬁc LBP was
deﬁned as current LBP with or without radiating leg pain of 6 –12 week duration
(Kovacs et al., 2005). The study inclusion criteria were: a diagnosis of sub-acute LBPin the absence of any major neurological de ﬁcit; age 18 –64 years; physical inactivity
(less than two 30-min exercise sessions per week) (Westcott et al., 2009); informedconsent; of ﬁce employee status; and more than 6 h of computer work per day. Exclusion
criteria were: a diagnosed cause of backache; chronic backache; disc or other majordisease; or lack of ﬂuency in Spanish. A total of 342 interested individuals sent an
email with their contact information to the research team. After reviewing the Preven-
tive Medicine medical database (i.e., the staff from Preventive Medicine checked theirmedical database to determine if the interested individuals ful ﬁlled the inclusion/exclu-
sion criteria), 138 of the 342 interested individuals were found to, a priori , fulﬁl the
inclusion/exclusion criteria and were contacted for an in person evaluation. Followingthe in-person evaluation, an additional 38 potential participants were excluded. Theremaining 100 patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to an online occupational exerciseintervention group or a control group.
Interventions
The exercise and education reminders used in the intervention programme were devel-
oped as an online resource, and included video demonstrations recorded in a laboratory.The resources were loaded onto a dedicated section of the University Preventive Medi-cine Service website. The physical exercise routine was designed and arranged by anexperienced physical training instructor under the supervision of the head of the Preven-
tive Medicine Service. All sessions included stretching, and exercises to improve pos-
tural stability (abdominal, lumbar, hip, and thigh muscles), muscle strength, ﬂexibility
and mobility. Mobility exercises involved large movements of the joints and the pos-tural stability muscles. Flexibility exercises were performed according to static workmethodology. Strength exercises were performed using progressive shortening:stretchingand speed:motion ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1, 3:1. A ratio 1:1 means 1 time spent in short-ening the muscle and 1 time spent in stretching the muscle. This explanation could befurther extended for all ratios involved.) and slight isometric contractions of all involved
muscle groups. The session ended with moderate stretching of all muscles used during
the session. The video provided a verbal and subtitled explanation of all exercises. Pos-tural education reminders (how best to sit at a computer) were designed by the Univer-sity Preventive Medicine Service clinician. Data on programme participation werecollected automatically when access to the programme was registered. Both studygroups had access to the usual routine care offered by the University Preventive Medi-cine Service. This included a routine annual medical examination by the lead clinician,and speci ﬁc online information on self-care in the work-place.
Intervention group
All participants received a brief daily email. This contained a reminder message (which
remained unchanged throughout the intervention) and a link to the online “session of the
day”. The sessions were structured in real time. First, a video of postural reminders was
viewed (2 min). This was followed by a video of the exercise(s) for the day (7 min).690 B. del Pozo-Cruz et al.
Finally, a repetition of postural reminders was provided (2 min). The videos were avail-
able from Monday to Friday every week for nine months. Each participant was assigneda user name and a password to access the system, and received a detailed explanation ofthe treatment programme (in written and verbal forms). Participants were asked not to
engage in any formal physical activity routine during the nine-month study period.
Control group
The control group had access to usual preventive medicine care only.
Measurement
Both groups were evaluated at baseline and on completion of the nine-month study per-
iod. Socio-demographic and health characteristics were documented at baseline, includ-ing age, sex and smoking habits. The study questionnaires were administered by atrained researcher (Gusi Prieto, Madruga, Garcia, & Gonzalez-Guerrero, 2009) who wasindependent of the study team and blind to treatment allocation. The stage of changequestionnaire, originally developed for smoke cessation, (Prochaska and DiClemente,1984) has been adapted for exercise (Marcus and Simkim, 1993; Cardinal 1995). Thisquestionnaire comprises ﬁve questions and assessed change in the behaviour domain in
terms of exercise allowing for a classi ﬁcation into ﬁve possible stages of LBP-related
exercise behaviour change: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, decision/action, and maintenance. At the end of the nine-month study period, the global stage ofchange status (as referred to exercise-related behaviour related to improving LBP) wasdetermined according to three possible scores: /C01, considered a negative behavioural
change; +1, considered a positive behavioural change; and 0, considered no change. Atthe end of the study, all participants in the intervention group were asked if they wouldlike to continue with the programme. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from the Euro-
quol-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) (Brooks, 1996; Herdman Badia, & Berra, 2001) and
the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (Fairbank, Couper, Davies, & O'Brien, 1980; Fair-bank and Pynsent, 2000) were used only for correlational purposes, as described below.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0. (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). For
independent measures, baseline comparisons were made using the Student ’s(t) test for
continuous variables, and the chi square test for nominal variables. The distribution of
the data was examined using the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test with Lilliefors correction.
The null hypothesis of no difference in the stage of change between treatment condi-tions at nine months was evaluated using chi square analysis. The same analysis wasused to evaluate differences in the global stage of change at nine months. Correlationsbetween the main study outcome (stage of change) and both VAS and ODI were evalu-ated using the Spearman correlation coef ﬁcient. The signi ﬁcance level was set at p< .05
for all tests.
Results
One hundred subjects were randomized (Figure 1). A session was considered to have
been completed if the participant remained logged in for at least 11 min. Participants inPsychology, Health & Medicine 691
the intervention group remained logged in for at least 11 min for 85.71% of all sessions.
In the intervention group, 92% (46 of 50) of the participants completed the programme.Of the four intervention group participants who dropped out, three were women whochanged jobs, and the other was a woman who stopped due to pregnancy. In the controlgroup, 88% (44 of 50) of the participants completed the study. The remaining sixparticipants dropped out through apparent lack of interest. No statistically signi ﬁcant
differences in baseline measurements were found between the two study groups(Table 1). In the intervention group, a positive association was found between the wish
to continue with the programme and maintenance phase status according to the stage of
change questionnaire (Odd ratio 5.4; 95% CI: 1.372 to 21.260; p= .012). In the inter-
vention group, signi ﬁcant positive effects were found for mean scores for all phases in
the behaviour domain (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the difference between treatments inTable 1. Characteristics of participants in the study at baseline ( n= 90).

Discussion
The present reanalysis of the trial study suggests that this intervention is effective to
improving exercise behaviour in of ﬁce workers with sub-acute non-speci ﬁc LBP, i.e.,
physically untrained of ﬁce workers in the intervention group became more physically
active in the workplace. This improvement was moderately and highly correlated withimprovements in self-reported health status and self-reported functional disability,respectively.
Although our University offers a range of out-of-work general physical activity pro-
grammes to its employees and its occupational preventive service offers advice concern-

ing enhancement of physical activity, all of the study participants were physically
untrained at baseline. The high level of adherence observed in the intervention groupmay have been due to the speci ﬁcity of our occupational intervention (for secondary
prevention of LBP) (Hudon, Fortin, & Soubhi, 2008). Participants in the intervention
group performed an 11-min session addressing health education and physical activity
ﬁve days per week. Previous research suggests that exercise programmes of short dura-
tion are preferable for employees who work long shifts (Bell and Burnett, 2009).
The present study was performed under “real Internet conditions ”and, thus, no
personal contact between participants and the research team was necessary during theperiod of training. Since of ﬁce work involves receipt of multiple emails daily, employees
may have been expected not to react to email contact from the study team, and to bereluctant to enrol in a study that has little direct relevance to their work (Marshall, Leslie,
Bauman, Marcus, & Owen, 2003; Leslie, Marshall, Owen, & Bauman, 2005). However,
to mimic the real-life implementation as much as possible, only one email was sent perday to improve adherence (Dunton and Robertson, 2008).
The current intervention has previously revealed the effectiveness on improve self-
reported health status and functional disability perception. The correlation model used todetermine the correlation between the investigated variables (Table 3) revealed that thechange in the behaviour domain was correlated with functional disability perception andself-reported health status. Maybe the improvement observed in the intervention group
regarding functional disability perception could affect self-reported health status (Kovacs
et al., 2004) and these improvements affect the behaviour of participants in the study.
The present study has several limitations. First, in order to can control as much as
possible the exercise programme of participants, we decided to only have the videosavailable from Monday to Friday and, therefore, a key feature of accessibility in inter-net-based interventions (Leykin et al., 2012) was not taken into account under the cur-rent intervention. Furthermore, an email containing a link to the URL of the session ofthe day was sent to remind the intervention group participants each day, and to encour-
age performance of the exercises. Although this reinforcement was done by non-behav-
iour stage of change-based message, our data indicate that there was a positiveimprovement in the behaviour domain in terms of exercise. In accordance with our data,Heelen et al., (Spittaels, De Bourdeaudhuij, Brug, & Vandelanotte, 2007) found that aweb-based physical activity intervention carried out at the workplace improved the levelof physical activity and lifestyle behaviour among a population of healthy of ﬁce work-
ers, although addition of a tailored email in comparison with standard advice did notinﬂuence outcome. Moreover, a key characteristic of the transtheoretical model is its
multidimensional design including the facets of the stages of change, the processes of
change, self-ef ﬁcacy and decisional balance. Therefore, to develop behaviour change
interventions, a good understanding of each dimension and how they interact with oneanother needs to be demonstrated. For study purposes, only the variable stage of changewas used limit the understanding on why the change has occurred. Further research isneeded to determine whether tailored interventions including an email reminder that arebased on behaviour change theories are more effective than the present intervention.Since most of the participants in the intervention group wished to continue with the
present programme, we did not enquire whether they would like to participate in other
types of exercise programmes and we did not test a follow up without reminders to elu-cidate if this intervention could be also feasible without. Despite this, the ﬁrst step
towards greater LBP-related exercise among physically untrained of ﬁce workers was
successfully achieved in the intervention group. Further research is warranted to eluci-694 B. del Pozo-Cruz et al.
date whether this strategy for promoting LBP-speci ﬁc exercise in physically untrained
ofﬁce workers could be used to achieve the amount of physical activity meeting in the
physical activity guidelines among LBP patients and other populations, also with a fur-ther period of training without reminders.
Conclusion
The present reanalysis of the trial suggests that the LBP-related exercise behaviour
among physically untrained of ﬁce workers with non-speci ﬁc sub-acute LBP improve
after the intervention period. Moderate to high correlation was found between behaviourrespect to the Oswestry disability index and self-reported health status.
