Objective: To explore men’s views of a pedometer-based walking program, part of a weight-management
intervention delivered through Scottish Premier League football clubs, and the congruence or challengethis poses to masculine identities. Methods: Semistructured telephone interviews with a sample of
participants in a gender-sensitized, group weight-management program. Interviewing continued untildata saturation was reached ( n/H1100529).Results: All men were positive about the context, style of delivery,
and content of the broader intervention. These things encouraged men to increase their physical activity(and adopt other behavioral changes) that they may not otherwise have found appealing. The success andacceptability of the walking program resided in three interrelated factors: (a) the utility of pedometers asa technology for motivation, self-monitoring and surveillance, and target setting; (b) the speed withwhich fitness was regained and weight reduced (enabling men to begin to do more desired forms ofphysical activity, and so regain visceral, experiential, and pragmatic masculine capital); and (c) bolsteringtheir masculine identities through the receipt of the program in a valued, masculinised context. Conclu-
sions: These data suggest that men will enthusiastically embrace a graduated walking program when the
presentation is gender sensitive in context, content, and delivery. Pedometers were viewed as a valuable,reliable technological aid which motivated men and empowered them in self-monitoring of progresstoward self-defined goals. Many men experienced the walking program as a means of regaining fitness,thereby enabling them to also regain valued masculine identities and activities, and a step towardregaining a more acceptable masculine body.

Obesity has “escalated” over the last four decades (Gortmaker et
al., 2011), and the prevalence in men in the U.K. is among thehighest in Europe (International Association for the Study ofObesity, 2010). Sixty-nine percent of men in Scotland are classedas “overweight” (body mass index [BMI] /H1102225 kg/m
2) or “obese”
(BMI/H1102230;Logue et al., 2010). On current trends, 70% of Britishpeople will be overweight/obese by 2020, and nearly 50% of men
in the U.K. will be obese by 2030 (Wang, McPherson, Marsh,Gortmaker, & Brown, 2011).
These trends pose a threat to individual health, a burden on
health services (Counterweight Project Team, 2008; Wang et al.,2011), and a challenge to public health (Gortmaker et al., 2011;

Greener, Douglas, & van Teijlingen, 2010; King, 2011). Obesity
increases the risk for many aspects of ill-health, and it contributesto premature mortality. Being obese at age 40 decreases lifeexpectancy for men by 5.8 years (Logue et al., 2010). Obese menare three times as likely to have high blood pressure (BP) as menof normal weight (Cancer Research, U.K., 2005), and 90% of casesof type 2 diabetes can be attributed to excess weight. There is amore than twofold increase in the risk of coronary artery diseaseand stroke among obese people (Government Office for Science,2007), and obesity is the second most important preventable causeof cancer after smoking (Cancer Research, U.K., 2005). Obesityhas also been linked to adverse sexual health outcomes in men,more than doubling the odds of erectile dysfunction in comparisonwith men of “normal” weight (Bajos, Wellings, Laborde, &Moreau, 2010). These obesity-associated comorbidities contributeto gender and socioeconomic inequalities and premature mortality,and they may affect men’s concerns about their own bodies andhealth status.
A 5–10% weight loss can produce significant health benefits
(National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence, 2006). Al-though there is debate about the best means to achieve this giventhe complex, multifactorial origins of the obesity “problem”(Greener et al., 2010; Swinburn et al., 2011; or indeed whether itis even appropriate to do so, see, e.g., Campos, Saguy, Ernsberger,Oliver, & Gaesser, 2006), individual behavioral change modifyingthe balance between energy input through dietary intake andoutput through physical activity (PA) is one part of the picture.Individual attempts to lose weight, as with all behavioral choices,are embedded within social and cultural contexts. As one conse-quence of this, they are gendered in myriad ways, not least becausehealth behaviors are one important means through which perfor-mances of gender are achieved, as discussed below.
Existing commercial and UK National Health Service weight-
loss programs are seldom used by men (Bye, Avery, & Lavin,2005; Ross, Laws, Reckless, Lean, & Counterweight ProjectTeam, 2008; Wilkins, 2007; Wolfe & Smith, 2002), both becauseweight-loss facilities and programs are perceived to be feminized“spaces” and because of longstanding links between dieting andfemale bodies (Orbach, 1978/2006). Idealized perceptions of maleand female bodies differ; the construction of differential distribu-tions of body fat and muscle by sex (Jonvallen, 2010) is onemanifestation of a wider social project to construct sex and sexdifferences through emphasizing distinct morphologies and func-tions for the male and female body (see, e.g., Fausto-Sterling,2005; Oudshoorn, 1994). Women are more likely to aspire toconventional biomedical definitions of “normal” weight, whereasmany men may seek to achieve a body weight and shape that is notconsistent with these definitions (Gill, Henwood, & McLean,2005;Monaghan, 1999, 2007). Men are more willing to challengethe validity of biomedical definitions of “overweight” and “obe-sity” (BMI /H1102225 and/H1102230, respectively; Gray, Hunt, Lorimer et al.,
2011), citing male film stars (e.g., Brad Pitt, Arnold Schwarzeneg-ger) and international rugby players who are archetypes of phys-ical fitness and health but whose BMI would categorize them as“obese” (Monaghan, 2007).
While accepting that not all men who exceed biomedical defi-
nitions of “obesity” will want to lose weight, cultural constructionsof masculinity and body shape, health, and health behavior argu-ably present particular challenges for those obese men who dowish to lose weight and regain fitness. First, eating (see, e.g., de
Souza & Cicllitira, 2005;Mróz, Chapman, Oliffe, & Bottorff,2010, 2011) and physical activity (see, e.g., Robertson, 2003a)patterns are important ways of “doing gender” (West & Zimmer-man, 1987), although as performances of masculinity they havereceived less attention than other behaviors such as help-seeking(Galdas, 2009; Hunt, Adamson, & Galdas, 2010; O’Brien, Hunt, &Hart, 2005) and drinking (de Visser & Smith, 2006, 2007; Emslie,Hunt, & Lyons, 2012; Lyons & Willott, 2008). While weight lossmay be desired, certain body morphologies challenge notions ofacceptable masculinities (Stibbe, 2004), and concerns about beingtoo thin or unhealthy-looking contribute to men being less likely todiet (Kiefer, Rathmanner, & Kunze, 2005; McPherson & Turnbull,2005; Monaghan, 2007; Pliner, Chaiken, & Flett, 1990). Men viewdieting as “feminine” (Gough, 2007), they are more likely to useexercise to control their weight (Kiefer et al., 2005), they are moreresistant to healthy-eating campaigns (Gough & Conner, 2006),and they are less aware of links between diet and ill health (Fraser,Welch, Luben, Bingham, & Day, 2000; Kiefer et al., 2005).Furthermore, alcohol may pose additional problems for men’sweight (Duvigneaud et al., 2007; The NHS Information Centre forHealth & Social Care, 2010), both because consumption is higherin men (Emslie, Lewars, Batty, & Hunt, 2009), and becausedrinking, alongside sport, is such an important resource in buildingmasculine identities and masculine “capital” (De Visser, Smith, &McDonnell, 2009). Many have argued that hegemonic perfor-mances of masculinity are inherently health-damaging (Courtenay,2000), and they mitigate against men taking care of their health. AsRobertson (2003b) has argued, men are caught in an ambiguousposition between being seen to care for their health as responsiblecitizens, without appearing to care too much as men.
There is limited evidence on what obese people would actually
like to help them to lose weight. Participants (106 obese womenand 36 obese men) in an Australian study wanted “noncommercialintervention s... focused on encouraging individuals to make
healthy lifestyle changes” (including PA changes) which were“nonjudgemental, nonstigmatising and empowered individuals toimprove their lifestyles rather than focusing on weight loss per se”(Thomas, Lewis, Hyde, Castle, & Komesaroff, 2010).
Walking is an ideal mode of PA for adults, and it has been
described as “the nearest activity to perfect exercise” (p. 328)because it is a cheap and safe way of increasing PA with minimaladverse effects (Morris & Hardman, 1997). For sedentary adults,walking can result in physiological benefits, by decreasing weight,BMI, percentage body fat and resting diastolic BP (Murphy, Nev-ill, Murtagh, & Holder, 2007), and it can also enhance psycholog-ical health (Baker et al., 2008). Individually tailored interventionsdelivered on a one-to-one, household or group basis are the mostsuccessful at increasing walking in those who are most sedentaryand/or most motivated to change (Ogilvie et al., 2007). Pedometershave been shown to be a motivational tool; for example a 12-weekpedometer-based program in combination with a PA consultationincreased walking, reduced sedentary behavior and increased pos-itive affect in a community sample not meeting current PA rec-ommendations (Baker et al., 2008). However, a limitation of theexisting literature on walking interventions is a bias toward re-cruiting women (Ogilvie et al., 2007); most evidence is based onstudies with entirely, or predominantly, female samples. Whenwalking projects have been offered in research contexts, more
58 HUNT, M CCANN, GRAY, MUTRIE, AND WYKE
women than men have participated. This could reflect a general
bias for women to take a more active part in health, and particu-larly weight-management initiatives, or a disinclination amongmen to adopt this form of PA, perhaps because it conflicts withpreferred performances of masculinity (Connell & Messerschmidt,2005). If the latter were the case, it would present a challenge inthe provision of weight-management programs for men, givenevidence that walking is the most effective and achievable meansof increasing PA levels in those who are classed as obese and thathave low fitness levels.
This paper reports on men’s receptivity to a walking program
which forms a key part of the PA component of an innovativeweight-management and healthy-living program, Football Fans inTraining (FFIT), for men who are overweight and obese. FFIT isa men-only, evidence-based (National Institute for Health & Clin-ical Excellence, 2006;Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network,2010) group intervention delivered over 12 (normally weekly)sessions at Scottish Premier League (SPL) football stadia bycommunity coaches trained in diet, nutrition, PA, and behaviorchange techniques to a standard protocol. A range of behaviorchange techniques based on control theory (e.g., self-monitoring ofweight and physical activity [including pedometer steps], intentionformation, goal setting and review, and feedback) have been drawnon in developing FFIT (Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer,& Gupta, 2009). The program is designed to be gender-sensitizedin context, content and style of delivery, building on sociologicalunderstandings of gender. In addition to advice on diet, alcohol,and sustainable behavior change strategies, FFIT has a focus onPA through an incremental pedometer-based walking program andpitch-side sessions led by club coaches (supplemented for somemen with more vigorous forms of PA in their own time). It strivesto present men with new ways of “doing health,” that are consis-tent with hegemonic ways of “doing gender” (West & Zimmer-man, 1987), exploiting the traditionally male environment of foot-ball clubs (Ireland & Watkins, 2010), existing loyalty to footballteams and the opportunity to participate in men-only groups tomaximize men’s engagement (Gray et al., 2009). The program’slocation within SPL football clubs reflects growing recognition ofthe potential of sporting organizations to deliver health initiativesto men and other hard-to-reach populations (Priest, Armstrong,Doyle, & Waters, 2008b).
The delivery of FFIT through SPL clubs is currently overseen
by the SPL Trust, and it is funded by the Football Pools andScottish Government. The program was piloted in 11 SPL clubsduring the 2010–2011 football season. At the same time, a feasi-bility trial was undertaken in two clubs (Heart of Midlothian andKilmarnock) in preparation for a full-scale randomized controlledtrial (RCT; Gray et al., in press), alongside qualitative research onthe coaches’ and participants’ experiences of the program (includ-ing those reported here). These informed refinements to the FFITprogram and the design of the subsequent RCT. The feasibilityfindings suggest that FFIT is likely to be successful in helping mento lose weight and gain other mental and physical health benefits,and it demonstrated that FFIT was extremely popular with the vastmajority of participants (Gray, Hunt, Mutrie et al., 2011). A fullRCT is ongoing, powered to assess whether participation in FFIThelps overweight/obese men to lose at least 5% of their body
weight 12 months after baseline (preprogram) measurement. Sec-ondary outcomes include BP, quality of life, self-esteem, mood,
self-reported PA, and an economic evaluation.
One part of our developmental work focused on men’s experi-
ences and views of the walking component of FFIT as this is thekey means to initially reengage participants in increased PA (manyof whom are very overweight [mean BMI of participants in thepilot deliveries was 34.5] and sedentary). This reflected a concernthat men may not consider walking a sufficiently masculine formof PA to embrace, given the lack of evidence on men’s views ofthis form of PA promotion. The data we report here demonstratethat this concern was ill-founded.
Methods
Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with men
who participated in pilot deliveries of FFIT in September-December 2010 at three clubs. These are located within the Centralbelt of Scotland, in/close to the urban areas in which the majorityof the Scottish population lives. The data presented constitute onepart of a broader evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability ofconducting a RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of FFIT, as de-scribed above. Following a short period of advertising via the SPLclubs and local media, 355 men (aged 35–65 years, average BMI34.5 kg/m
2) from a wide range of backgrounds (roughly equal
proportions from the five quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation)
were enrolled on FFIT at 11 of the 12 SPL clubs in September2010 (including 52 men who formed the waiting list comparisongroups in our feasibility trial). Ethical approval was granted by theSchool of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, University of Stirling.
For this research on experiences of the walking program, FFIT
participants in three clubs were asked by their coaches if theywould be willing to take part in a telephone interview asking abouttheir views of the program, and if so, to sign a sheet givingpermission for their contact details to be forwarded to the researchteam. One researcher (CM), who was not otherwise involved in theSPL clubs or in the development of FFIT or the feasibility trial/RCT, then contacted these participants, choosing at random fromthese lists. Four of the 31 men approached were unable to take partbecause of time constraints. We chose not to conduct this addi-tional qualitative research in the two feasibility trial clubs becausesome of our research team were in close contact with men at theseclubs, and we wanted to minimize the likelihood that our telephoneinterviewees might express more positive views about the programbecause of their familiarity with research team members. Never-theless, data (including interviews with men who did not completethe course) from the feasibility trial clubs on other aspects of theprogram (e.g., general views on the program) are very consistentwith those expressed by the men in the telephone interviews.Interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ informed con-sent, transcribed verbatim, and checked for accuracy.
Men were interviewed in the last third of the 12-week program.
As part of the consent procedure, they were assured that they couldwithdraw from the interview at any time, they could choose not toanswer any questions, and their participation/lack of participationwould not affect future participation in FFIT or activities at theirclub. The topic guide included men’s experiences of various as-pects of FFIT (including the walking and PA components, thesetting and overall views of the program, and what had attractedthem to sign up for FFIT). Because informal feedback from par-59 MEN, MASCULINITY, WALKING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
ticipants at the feasibility trial clubs had been so positive, CM
specifically prompted men in ways that would make them feelcomfortable about expressing any negative views. For example, allwere asked if there was anything they had not liked about theprogram, whether they saw any disadvantages to having a wide agerange, and whether the program had led to any negative changes intheir life. With respect to walking, men were asked “How have yougot on with the suggested walking program?” To encourage themto express any negative views, CM said “Some people have saidthat this kind of walking program may not be the most appealingkind of exercise for men. What do you think about that? Do youagree?”
Originally, we planned to undertake 20 telephone interviews
focusing on men’s experience of the walking program. In practice,to ensure that we had allowed for a range of opinions in all threeclubs, we continued until 27 interviews had been completed—bythat time, we were very satisfied that data saturation had beenachieved. Transcripts were read repeatedly by two researchers(KH, CM) to identify both responses to questions of interest andemerging, unexpected themes (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Pope,Ziebland, & Mays, 2000). For this paper, analysis focused onmen’s receptivity to the walking program, in the context of thewider program and its setting. The full range of accounts of thewalking program was indexed, and all issues relevant to eachheading were noted, along with Participant ID numbers (Ziebland& McPherson, 2006). As explanations for men’s receptivity to thewalking program were formulated, constant comparison (checkingthe emerging analysis against every instance of similarly indexeddata) allowed reformulation and amendment of explanations, andit ensured that all perspectives were represented. This process wasundertaken by KH. QSR nVivo 8 (http://www.qsrinternational.com/) was used to facilitate handling of the transcripts, and it wasused to ensure that all material relating to each theme was con-sidered. Extracts which typified key themes were chosen to illus-trate the analysis; deviant cases were actively sought, includingrereading all transcripts in their entirety postcoding to check thatno negative views had been overlooked in the coding process.
Findings
Almost all respondents were very enthusiastic about FFIT; they
described it as “brilliant” (e.g., TI-1, TI-26), “superb” (TI-5),“ideal” (TI-16), “very, very good” (TI-20), “very beneficial,” and“excellent” (TI-10). Many felt that the SPL club setting and thedelivery of the course by coaches were key to the program’sacceptability. As one (TI-1) said, “You’re doing it at a place whereyou go to support your team and you are actually involved in it (theteam) you’re inside the stadium and you are actually getting shownabout. It’s fantastic.”
A small number of men were more muted in their evaluations,
saying that the program had been “quite good” (TI-17, TI-21) or“quite useful” (TI-23), but none were negative. When prompted toexpress any negative views (e.g., “Were there any things youdidn’t like about the program?”), men at most suggested “a fewtweaks” (TI-11): a few said they would have liked more challeng-ing in-stadia exercise sessions earlier on, and a few men at oneclub said the coaches seemed unconfident about the classroommaterial to start with, recognizing that it was the first delivery ofthe program.Almost all of the men were positive about the walking program.
For example, one said he had learned how “easy exercise is to dowithout any equipment. That’s really helped” (TI-17). Anothersaid that “everybody’s taken to it” (TI-13), and another said that hehad “thoroughly enjoyed it, cause like everything else you’ve gotto walk before you can run. Pardon the pun” (TI-26). This did notmean that all men had found the walking program easy; some citedspecific difficulties such as dark nights, very cold weather, orconstraints of night shifts or other aspects of their work. The fewmen who were less enthusiastic about the walking program werethose who already walked quite a bit, or who were much moreactive than the majority of participants. The most negative (TI-14)had recently trained to do a long sponsored walk through work. Hesaid “that’s maybe put me off the walking side of i t...I wear my
pedometer religiousl y... [but] I don’t enjoy going out walking the
street...I much prefer going to the gym.” Another man said that
he was getting “bored now with my walks ’cause there’s only somany routes you can take” (TI-24).
Analysis suggested that for the vast majority of men the success
and acceptability of the walking program derived from threeinterrelated factors: (a) the utility of the pedometers as a technol-ogy for motivation, self-monitoring, and self-competition (targetsetting); (b) the speed with which most men regained a degree offitness and lost weight (thereby, as we will argue, enabling them toregain the prospect of undertaking more desired forms of physicalactivity, and so regaining visceral, experiential, and pragmaticmasculine capital; De Visser et al., 2009; Watson, 2000); and (c)bolstering their masculine identities through the receipt of theprogram in a valued, masculinised context (the football setting).
Pedometers as a Technology for Motivation,
Self-Surveillance, and Self-Competition
The walking program within FFIT was inextricably linked by
the men to the pedometer, which proved to be a highly acceptedand acceptable piece of technology. Each man was given a pe-dometer during the first session, and all were encouraged to setindividual targets week-on-week to increase their step counts fromtheir baseline level. Initially, the pedometer demonstrated to somemen just how sedentary their lives had become:
In my work, I’m either you know, sitting driving, or I’m sitting in a
meeting, or I’m sitting at a desk, but the worst for me is actually theworking from home because I will get up in the morning, comedownstairs, do some work, grab a shower, come back downstairs, sitand do some wor k...... having a look and seeing that you know, the
sort of general average for unfit people was about two thousand stepsand you know, I’m like tha t...a couple o’ hunner [hundred]! (TI-2)
The pedometer acted as an objective, reliable, and indisputable
technology to bring this message home. As one man said, “It wasreally, really fascinating. I mean, at the beginning, there’s no twoways, I was sedentar y...a n dI remember at the beginning think-
ing that, oh, this is just awful. It’s just never gonna happen” (TI-7).Just one man disputed the reliability of his device (“The only thingI find a wee bitty disappointing is when sometimes I think I’veactually walked more but the steps [pedometer] are saying I’ve not.I had to check the pedometer a few times” [TI-16]).
Almost all men made some comment which demonstrated that
pedometer use quickly became habitual and routine. For example,60 HUNT, M CCANN, GRAY, MUTRIE, AND WYKE
one (TI-18) said he wore it “religiously,” and another said that it
was “like fastening a seatbelt” (TI-21). One related a story dem-onstrating the taken-for-grantedness of pedometer use in theirdaily lives:
One of the guys got so attached tae [to] it that he actually went for a
swim, forgot he was changing out of his trousers intae [into] his shortsand put the bloody pedometer on when he went to the pool! Naw, it’sbeen as I say, I really canny [can’t] say enough good things about it,honestly. (TI-7)
Thus, men quickly appreciated the utility and dependability of
their pedometer, and they incorporated it into their daily lives.They made men’s daily physical inactivity levels visible andindisputable. Importantly, the pedometer provided a means for
self-monitoring which motivated the men, particularly in the earlyweeks of the program: as one said, “It helps me- because I’ve gota target that I’m looking for” (TI-24). Men liked its accessibilityand tangibility:
[Its r]eally good ,... it’s amazing a wee [little] device like that can-
you’re, you know- before you maybe thought you’d been stayingactive but, you know when you look at your pedometer you realizeyou hadnae [hadn’t] .... need to go out, do something cause I really
havenae done that much today. (TI-18)
I love that part of it but I never go without my [pedometer ]... it’s
amazing, it really is amazing, I mean I wear it every day and recordit every da y... That’s another thing that’s tangible, something you
can touch and see you know ,...I tw a so n eo ft h e best things they
done to be honest wi’ [with] yo u...I think everybody was highly
delighted wi’ the pedometer. (TI-12)
The interviews showed how men used the pedometers to cali-
brate their physical activity, adjusting daily routines to increasetheir step count. The pedometers thus enabled men to monitor theiractivity and progress toward their goals. The immediacy of theobjective feedback was highly motivating for the majority. TI-20said it had:“really, really focused my min d... when I get up in the
mornin g... first thing that goes on is the pedometer. And it’s the
last thing that comes off at night. Cause you’re obviously trying tosqueeze in as many steps as you can.” The pedometer appealed asa masculinised piece of technology, enabling the men to applyrational problem-solving skills to achieving self-negotiated targets:
That [pedometer] has been my Godsend. It becomes almost like,
competitive with yourself. You know you’re sitting at 10 o’clock atnight, I’ve only done 8,000, I’ll need to go and take the dog backo o t...I ’ m definitely going to keep that clipped on my belt, when I
stop [FFIT] ....I ’ m walking places I’d just never have dreamed of
walking you kno w...I find it’s great, like I walk to football on a
Saturday, I’d have took a taxi every time. But noo [now] it’s a 40minute walk to the football. I just don’t even think aboot it no o....
I’m walking, getting up in the morning, taking the dog and stuff likethat.... (TI-19)
It’s actually given me a good kick up the backsid e... it’s made me
consciously go out of my way to walk more .... every week I’ve built
up the step count and I live in a modern block of flat s...In o wu s e
the stairs and the, instead of the lif t... it’s just little things like that
and I’m making a conscious effort every da y...h o w a m I doing?
How can I get more out of this? (TI-6)Through using their pedometers, men began to get a more
experiential understanding of the level of exercise they needed tobuild into their daily lives, and they sometimes verged on theevangelical when promoting its benefits. For example, one said:
This pedometer’s instilled paranoia in me! I jus t...I mean I actually
had a look at it today an d...Iw a s astounded that I hadnae walked
enough so I need tae [to] go tae the gy m...I think everybody should
have on e...I mean, I didn’t know how many steps you know, the
ratio of these steps tae miles was and noo that I know it’s probablyabout four thousand to two miles, I can tell by this pedometer howmuch I’ve actually exercise d... (TI-3)
On top of these practical utilities, a few men’s comments sug-
gested the pedometer had symbolic value in demonstrating theirefforts to regain their fitness and their more youthful bodies:
Again it’s all daft psychology, the pedometer’s actually really
great... it’s a bit like the track suit, you’ve got a badge saying, look
I’m trying .... there was one of the days at work I forgot tae wear it
and I got a row off one of the guys for no wearing it s o... aye, again,
I cannae [can’t] say enough good things about that. (TI-7)
Regaining Masculine Capital and Ideals Through
Regaining Fitness and Losing Weight
Many men talked about being pleased with how quickly the
walking program helped them to begin to lose weight, and regainfitness and a more valued body shape:
I’ve lost a reasonable amount of weight over the time I’ve been in it
[FFIT], I do feel an awful lot more fitter, I know I walk a lot quickerthan I ever did before. So in a relatively short time it has been a benefitto me. (TI-18)
These changes gave some men the ability and confidence to
progress to forms of physical activity (such as squash or football)which are more traditionally seen as being valued by men, activ-ities which just weeks before they would have felt unable tocontemplate: “It’s got me going back to the gym and stuff like that,on top of the walking” (TI-24). Quite quickly, men were able toconceive of progressing physically, psychologically, and in termsof taking up (again) activities which they valued, overcomingbarriers which previously had seemed less surmountable:
I’m actually moving differently you know, like previously tae [to]
doing this I was probably moving in the most lethargic way possible,whereas noo it’s you know, I’m getting my stomach involved and youknow, and swinging my arm s...a si fI ’ ma youngster agai n... when

Some were much more explicit about specific health benefits
they felt that they had already gained through participation in thewalking program:61 MEN, MASCULINITY, WALKING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
You’re at an age where you’ve got to start thinking about what you’re
putting into your body and how much exercise you’re taking becausethere’ll come a time when you won’t be able to take any exercise, it’llbe too late .... I’ve known I’ve let myself get out of shape and you
know and I’m almost back to where I want to b e...t h e physical

a sw e l l... it’s the health thing that you’ve got to keep thinking about.
(TI-8)
The language used in these accounts portrayed vitality (“bounc-
ing up the stairs,” “swinging my arms”). Also, it illustrated that theregaining of health and fitness was often aligned by the men witha regaining of youth, or of their younger selves (“as if I’m ayoungster again,” “as if we were teenagers,” “a reversal of some-thing I didnae think was reversible”). And, it suggested that manyof the men had become more conscious that they could no longertake their physical bodies for granted.
Bolstering Masculine Identities Through Occupancy of
a Valued Masculinised Space
All of the men made some reference to the context in which they
undertook FFIT. The location in SPL football clubs served as ahook, an additional incentive to take on something that they feltthey wanted to (or should) do but had felt unable to do in othercontexts. The football club was a space they valued, felt comfort-able in, thought other men would recognize as having intrinsicworth and appeal, and would attract men like them:
It [FFIT] was ideal for me ....I wanted to actually join it because see
the guys that are sort of similar to myself, put on a wee bit weight
....b u t obviously being a [club] supporter all my life, that was a big
plus as well, because even talking to people saying “oh it was like I’mgoing to be on this 12, 13 week course, but it’s with [club]”, so thatwas an incentive as well. (TI-16)
In addition to, or because of, their low levels of activity and
what they viewed as their compromised bodies, most of the menwere starting from a point where they could not have contemplatedtrying to become more active in a context which exposed their lossof fitness, youth and physicality, and their compromised bodies.
I’m no gonna join a gym or anything like that because I just don’t like
that kinda thing. I might have a look at the Jogging Buddies which isanother local thing but it just makes me aw kinda nervous, all thesekinda...y o u know, you know the types, you know wear all the gear
and run wi’ their wee jogging bottles and stuff like that. (TI-2)
Participation through the football club in a weight-management
program, evidently geared to some degree toward addressinghealth concerns, thus did not threaten the men’s masculine iden-tities; in many ways, it even enhanced their masculine capital,emphasizing their increased proximity and closeness to a valuedmasculine space (“it’s with the club”). As one said, in response tothe prompt “Some people have suggested that type of walkingprogram, you know with the pedometer and things, wouldn’tappeal to men.”
It’s not been my experience .. and to a man everyone’s still used
t h a t...n o wa n d again the odd person says, “What’s that [pedometer]you’ve got on? .. I think that’s what helps, when you say “I’m training
with [club] ”...S o it’s not been a problem or any embarrassment or
anything like that for me. (TI-24)
This man’s denial that being seen to be doing something about
his health, fitness or weight (wearing the pedometer) has “not beena problem or any embarrassment” suggests that he (perhaps sub-consciously) recognizes a need to justify such health-related ac-tivities. Being able to say that he is training with club coaches ina masculinised space neutralizes any threat to his masculine iden-tity (“I think that’s what helps”). The program thus offered par-ticipants something that they could succeed and even excel at, ameans of embracing exercise, an attempt to lose weight and/orhealth in a nonthreatening and valued environment:
It was a bit weight watchers like for the first 5 minutes and I think
if I had turned up and it wasn’t [club] and if it wasn’t the FFITprogram I might have been tempted to just bail at that point but ehthe fact that it’s [the club] and it’s your club you tend to stick it outthat wee bit longer and I’m delighted that I did cos eh it has madea hell of a difference. (TI-2)
The wary reference to Weight Watchers in this man’s comment
similarly articulates the kinds of (feminised) activities that menmight not wish to be seen to be doing, an example of rejected,discounted, or disprefered weight-loss programs or regimes thatare theoretically available for men but which culturally feel inac-cessible, inappropriate, or threatening to their identities as men.
Discussion
These data show that (when presented in a way and a context
which is congruent with, rather than challenging to, certain mas-culine ideals) trying to lose weight and taking care of/striving toimprove one’s health are not anathema to men’s identities. Spe-cifically, in relation to this paper’s primary focus on walking, therewas widespread enthusiasm for this form of PA, particularlyamong the majority who were very inactive prior to joining theprogram. We would argue that the context, setting, and style ofdelivery allowed men to participate in what might otherwise bepresumed to be a less valued form of physical activity (Verdonk,Seesing, & de Rijk, 2010) and to absent themselves from a “don’tcare/should care” dilemma (Robertson, 2003b). Tannebaum and
Frank have commented on how “ageing men must struggle tomaintain a culturally accepted masculine identity as the Westernideal of manliness ends with middle ag e... , leaving ageing men
without socially dictated parameters for gender expressio n... ”
(Tannenbaum & Frank, 2011, p. 244). They continue that, whenconfronted with a health threat (especially we would argue here,when combined with a concomitant threat of having an insuffi-ciently well-functioning body), “men have a choice of denying thethreat, modifying risk factors and health behaviors in an attempt toalleviate the threat, or seeking professional help” (Tannenbaum &Frank, 2011, p. 244). These data suggest that the FFIT program hasenabled men to make tangible changes to the daily lives androutine health behaviors that bolster, rather than threaten, theirmasculine capital (De Visser et al., 2009): they have gainedproximity to valued (usually inaccessible) masculine spaces, theyhave regained physical capacities and levels of functioning (and tosome degree, physiques [Monaghan, 2005; Tiggemann, Martins, &Kirkbridge, 2007]) that they thought they had lost through aging62 HUNT, M CCANN, GRAY, MUTRIE, AND WYKE
and substantial weight gain, and hence many have regained the
confidence and ability to take up (again) more valued physicalactivities which are widely recognized as markers of valued en-actments of masculinity (Gill et al., 2005; Moss, 2011). Thewalking component of FFIT was a crucial element of this success,one that proved far more universally popular than might have beenpredicted from some literature on gender and physical activity.These data provide just one illustration of how it is possible formen to “do health” in a health-enhancing way while not compro-mising the ways that they “do gender” (Connell & Messerschmidt,2005; Sloan, Gough, & Conner, 2010; West & Zimmerman, 1987)in more traditional, hegemonic ways.
These data thus add to evidence which suggests that, when
sociological understandings of gender and evidence-based,behavioral-change techniques are used to inform intervention de-sign and delivery, men willengage with walking programs and
other healthy lifestyle interventions. It demonstrates that a group-delivered weight-management/healthy-living program need not beexperienced as “only for women” (Bye et al., 2005). It alsodemonstrates the potential of professional sports clubs and otherinnovative settings to engage men in programs designed to encour-age more healthful practices and to reach traditionally difficult-to-access populations (Brady, Perry, Murdoch, & McKay, 2010;Daniel, 2000; Duffin, 2006; English Premier League, 2010; Priest,Armstrong, Doyle, & Waters, 2008a; Pringle, 2009; Snow, 2004).While the football setting proved to be the crucial hook, enablingthese men to overcome prior barriers or reluctance to tackle theirweight and other health issues, the underlying principle of sitinginterventions in loci that are highly valued and unthreateningsuggests that, with small adaptations as dictated by context, theprogram could be transferred to other settings (e.g., rugby clubs,social clubs), and thus be accessible to other men.
The evidence that we present here is almost universally positive,
despite prompting men specifically to discuss any negative expe-riences and our scrutiny of the data for deviant cases. This may bea straightforward reflection of men’s experiences of the walkingprogram. However, it is important to note some limitations. Theseinterviews were with overweight and obese men who had re-sponded to media or club-based advertisements about the FFITprogram and had attended FFIT for at least six weeks. In this partof the research, we only had the means and the ethical permissionto interview continuing attenders, but the minority of men whodropped out are likely to be less positive. Although the interviewerhad no previous involvement with the FFIT program or the clubs,and men were assured that taking part (or not) would not affecttheir involvement with FFIT or their club, it may be that some stillfelt inhibited about giving negative feedback.
In conclusion, this paper focuses on men’s experiences of mak-
ing tangible changes to their physical activity patterns through thewalking program; results of the ongoing RCT of FFIT will beavailable in due course. We would argue that these data providestrong evidence that a structured, group-delivered, pedometer-based walking program: (a) can be highly acceptable to men; (b)can act as a means of regaining fitness, and enable the regaining ofvalued masculine activities and identities; and (c) represent a steptoward regaining a more acceptable masculine body. The analysissuggests that men’s relatively low uptake of walking programs (inrelation to women) in past research and community settings (Ogil-vie et al., 2007) does not reflect a disinclination among men toadopt this form of physical activity. Rather, we agree with others
(DeVille-Almond et al., 2011) who have suggested that there is anonus to continue to think more innovatively about making suchprograms accessible and appealing to men.
