Abstract
Background: By 2050, worldwide dementia prevalence is expected to triple. Affordable, scalable interventions are
required to support protective behaviours such as physical activity, cognitive training and healthy eating. This paper
outlines the theory-, evidence- and person-based development of ‘Active Brains ’: a multi-domain digital behaviour
change intervention to reduce cognitive decline amongst older adults.
Methods: During the initial planning phase, scoping reviews, consultation with PPI contributors and expert co-
investigators and behavioural analysis collated and recorded evidence that was triangulated to inform provisional
‘guiding principles ’and an intervention logic model. The following optimisation phase involved qualitative think
aloud and semi-structured interviews with 52 older adults with higher and lower cognitive performance scores.
Data were analysed thematically and informed changes and additions to guiding principles, the behavioural
analysis and the logic model which, in turn, informed changes to intervention content.
Results: Scoping reviews and qualitative interviews suggested that the same intervention content may be suitable
for individuals with higher and lower cognitive performance. Qualitative findings revealed that maintaining
independence and enjoyment motivated engagement in intervention-targeted behaviours, whereas managing ill
health was a potential barrier. Social support for engaging in such activities could provide motivation, but was not
desirable for all. These findings informed development of intervention content and functionality that appeared
highly acceptable amongst a sample of target users.
Conclusions: A digitally delivered intervention with minimal support appears acceptable and potentially engaging
to older adults with higher and lower levels of cognitive performance. As well as informing our own intervention
development, insights obtained through this process may be useful for others working with, and developing
interventions for, older adults and/or those with cognitive impairment.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15There is very limited evidence about whether digital
delivery of multi-domain behaviour change interven-
tions is feasible, engaging and acceptable in the con-
text of protecting cognitive health. It is also unclear
whether the same intervention content, structure
and functionality is suitable for both those with and
without existing cognitive impairment.
/C15This study demonstrated that a digital multi-domain
behaviour change intervention can be acceptable
and engaging amongst UK community-dwelling
older adults. Iterative development of intervention
content with users facilitated identification and reso-
lution of potential barriers to acceptability and en-
gagement. Importantly, there were no substantive
differences between those with higher and lower
cognitive performance scores regarding their inter-
vention preferences, nor their ability and willingness
to engage with it.
/C15These findings confirmed that the ‘Active Brains ’
digital intervention content and activity
recommendations should be suitable for older adults
with and without existing cognitive impairment. Our
subsequent feasibility and fully-powered trials will
therefore test the same intervention amongst both
of these groups.
Background
Fifty-million people worldwide currently have dementia
[1]. Cognitive impairment is even more common; mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-associated cogni-
tive decline (AACD) are estimated to affect nearly 20%
of adults aged 60 and over [ 2,3]. Around 10% of MCI
and AACD cases convert to dementia each year [ 4]. The
annual global cost of dementia is nearly US$1 trillion
with dementia prevalence expected to rise to 152 million
by 2050 [ 5]. Dementia and cognitive decline place un-
sustainable demand on health and social care systems
worldwide, and pose substantial threat to individuals ’in-
dependence and quality of life [ 6]. Prevention and man-
agement of dementia are public health priorities [ 7].
Increasing evidence suggests that health-related behav-
iours (e.g., physical activity and a Mediterranean-style
diet) and cognitive training are protective of cognitive
health [ 7–12]. Interventions targeting a single behaviour
in individuals with and without existing cognitive im-
pairment show some positive effects on cognitive out-
comes [ 13–18]. However, findings are mixed and often
inconclusive, prompting investigation of multi-domain
intervention strategies [ 1,7]. Complex behaviour change
interventions are those that have several interacting
components to try to achieve their aim [ 19]. Further to
this, multi-domain interventions are those which targetmultiple risk factors and mechanisms for a particular
condition [ 20], for example physical activity, cognitive
training and healthy eating. Multi-domain interventions
to prevent or reduce cognitive decline have shown
mixed results [ 18,21–23]. Despite positive effects of a
face-to-face (group and individual) delivered programme
addressing diet, physical activity, cognitive training and
managing vascular risk [ 21], such interventions tend to
be resource-intensive, prompting calls for scalable, cost-
effective approaches [ 7,18]. Understanding which inter-
vention components are useful and how to improve
cost-effectiveness is a key challenge [ 7]. Rapid develop-
ment of advanced technologies and artificial intelligence
will likely play a key role in future delivery of cognitive
training in a way that is immersive and highly engaging
for users, allowing adaptive personalisation and gamifi-
cation [ 24–26]. In the meantime, comparatively ‘low-
tech’digital solutions may offer a cost-effective means of
delivering cognitive training alongside other behaviour
change intervention components.
Digital health-behaviour interventions have excellent
potential to deliver content efficiently, effectively and ac-
cessibly at low cost [ 27]. There is early evidence that
web-based multi-domain lifestyle programs may have
potential for protecting cognitive health outcomes and
dementia prevention [ 28] but much of this research is in
very early stages. Furthermore, few of these studies test
interventions that offer a combination of cognitive train-
ing and facilitation of health-related behaviour change.
One pre-post design study showed promising effects of a
digital intervention addressing behaviours including
physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol intake and sleep,
but did not measure cognitive outcomes [ 29]. Further-
more, there is limited evidence about whether digital-
delivery of interventions is feasible, engaging and accept-
able in this context. Potential barriers to feasibility and
acceptability relate to users ’cognitive capacity and
digital literacy. It is important to explore whether indi-
viduals with cognitive decline have different preferences
and requirements for intervention functionality. Further-
more, whilst older adults ’digital literacy is rapidly grow-
ing, there is still wide variation in ability and/or
willingness to engage with digital health material [ 30,
31]. It is therefore important to explore whether digital
content and functionality can be made accessible and
engaging for these users, and how best to achieve this.
The aims of this paper are twofold: (1) to explore
whether a digital approach appears to be a feasible, en-
gaging and acceptable means of delivering a low-cost,
multi-domain intervention to reduce cognitive decline
amongst older adults; (2) to provide a clear account of
how such an intervention was created through docu-
menting its systematic development process. Clear
reporting of the development of new interventionsEssery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 2 of 16
avoids ‘research waste ’and duplication of ineffective, un-
feasible or unacceptable interventions [ 32]. This paper
outlines the development of ‘Active Brains ’: a digital
intervention for 60 –85 year-olds with and without exist-
ing cognitive impairment, aiming to reduce cognitive de-
cline by addressing physical activity, cognitive training
and healthy eating behaviours. We explain how the work
conducted during this intervention development process
allowed Active Brains to be shaped by target users ’ex-
pectations and preferences, whilst highlighting transfer-
able insights and methods that could be applied across
numerous behaviour change contexts.
Methods
Structure of the development process
Active Brains was developed according to a theory-, evi-
dence- and person-based approach to intervention de-
velopment [ 19,33,34]. The development process was
implemented, and is outlined below, in two phases:
phase 1: planning and phase 2: optimisation. The ‘Plan-
ning’phase presents the theory-, evidence- and person-based ‘Guiding Principles ’[34] and logic model that
underpin intervention content and functionality. The
‘Optimisation ’phase presents our qualitative findings
about older adults ’perceptions of cognitive health and as-
sociated protective health behaviours, as well as their feed-
back on all aspects of intervention content throughout
development. Although described separately, in practice,
these phases occurred as an iterative cycle (Fig. 1). Devel-
opment focused on the physical activity and cognitive
training intervention elements as the team had previously
developed a healthy eating module that could be adapted
for use in this context [ 35]. Additional Table 1summa-
rises how each element of the Active Brains development
process addresses recommended actions for intervention
development [ 32].
Monthly development meetings were held with a
multi-disciplinary team of coinvestigators including Pa-
tient and Public Involvement (PPI) representatives. PPI
members played a significant role in ensuring that study
and intervention materials were accessible, engaging and
persuasive prior to being shared with participants. The
Fig. 1 Planning and optimisation processes involved in the development of Active BrainsEssery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 3 of 16
wider management team met quarterly and included
GPs, specialist clinicians, health psychologists, dementia
charity partners and academics with expertise in physical
activity, cognitive health and nutrition. Draft interven-
tion materials were frequently shared for comment and
iteration.
The following sections outline the methods employed
in: phase 1, planning the intervention ’s theoretical
framework; and phase 2, the empirical qualitative work
conducted to optimise Active Brains. Respective find-
ings/outcomes from each of these processes are reported
in the results section.
Phase 1: planning Active Brains
The planning phase aimed to build the appropriate the-
ory-, evidence- and person-based framework to underpin
the Active Brains intervention. This involved reviewing
relevant literature, seeking input from PPI contributors
and co-investigators with relevant expertise, developing
guiding principles, conducting a behavioural analysis and
constructing a logic model.
Phase 1, part 1: reviewing relevant literature
We conducted rapid scoping reviews of (1) physical ac-
tivity and/or sedentary behaviour interventions, and (2)
cognitive training interventions, for older adults with
and without cognitive impairment. We aimed to gather
evidence about: promising intervention features; relevant
contextual factors; and important influences on targeted
behaviours. Searches were conducted in Web of Science,
March –June 2017 (Additional Table 2). Additional lit-
erature was identified through reference-list searching
and consultation within our team. Quantitative and
qualitative papers were included. Initial searches
returned over 9000 matches about cognitive training in-
terventions including a significant number of existing
systematic reviews in this field. Therefore, we focused
only on systematic reviews ( n= 14) given that these had
collated, and quality assessed, a wealth of evidence about
existing cognitive training interventions. Data were ex-
tracted about research design, sample size and character-
istics, and findings.
Phase 1, part 2: development of guiding principles
Guiding principles aim to maximise the acceptability of
an intervention amongst target users and, therefore, to
enhance engagement and effectiveness. Each guiding
principle comprises (1) a design objective outlining a
user/context-specific behavioural need, issue or chal-
lenge; and (2) intervention features that address the de-
sign objective [ 34]. To draft provisional guiding
principles, we drew on our understanding of target users
obtained from the scoping reviews and from our re-
search team, including PPI members. These guidingprinciples were iteratively developed as new data
emerged, e.g. from the behavioural analysis and qualita-
tive interviews.
Phase 1, part 3: developing Active Brains programme
theory
A programme theory explicitly describes how an inter-
vention is expected to achieve its intended outcomes,
and the anticipated mechanisms through which this oc-
curs [ 36]. The behavioural analysis and logic model con-
tributed to this process.
Phase 1, part 3a: behavioural analysis The behavioural
analysis aimed to identify behaviours to be targeted by
Active Brains and their potential barriers and facilitators.
We recorded relevant evidence from scoping reviews,
PPI input, team expertise and later qualitative interviews
into a table, and mapped the identified behaviours and
potential barriers and facilitators onto constructs from
the behaviour change wheel (BCW) [ 37] and theoretical
domains framework (TDF) [ 38] in order to describe tar-
get domains for our intervention in theoretical terms.
Given that so many different behaviour change theories
have overlapping constructs, it can be difficult to identify
any one individual theory to apply [ 39,40]. Accordingly,
we drew on these theoretical frameworks derived from
multiple theories that encapsulate a wide range of theor-
etical constructs. This allowed clear description of the
intervention processes and components, including be-
havioural domains to be targeted, intervention functions
to address barriers and facilitators and behaviour change
techniques BCTs [ 41]; to deliver these functions. In
addition, this process facilitated identification of other
potentially useful domains to target, and additional
intervention functions and BCTs to employ that may
maximise the intervention ’s possible effects on its target
behaviours [ 37].
Phase 1, part 3b: the Active Brains intervention logic
model In line with Medical Research Council (MRC)
guidance [ 42], we constructed a logic model to diagram-
matically represent the expected mechanisms of action
of Active Brains. This drew on the scoping reviews, team
expertise, guiding principles and behavioural analysis.
Phase 2: optimising Active Brains
The optimisation phase aimed to seek feedback on draft
intervention material, and to explore the acceptability
and feasibility of the digital content and functionality
amongst older adults with higher and lower levels of
cognitive performance. Due to the vast quantity of rele-
vant literature available to inform initial content devel-
opment, as well as substantial expertise and experience
to draw on from our project team and PPI, primaryEssery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 4 of 16
qualitative research was delayed in favour of planning
and drafting initial content [ 43]. This was deemed ap-
propriate given the depth of understanding we felt we
could obtain from the existing literature and both PPI
and expert co-investigator knowledge to inform our
guiding principles. This allowed us to seek feedback on
initial drafts of our intervention content sooner, and
meant we could, and did, still explore target users ’expe-
riences to inform changes required. Our iterative devel-
opment process meant that our target users ’views still
closely informed content development from an early
stage. This included returning to elements of the plan-
ning phase, such as guiding principles and behavioural
analysis, to revise these as and when our primary quali-
tative work indicated that we may need to change or add
to our previous assumptions.
Phase 2, part 1: think-aloud interviews
Participants Forty-one adults (22 female, mean age =
70.5 years, range 61 –80) were recruited from GP prac-
tices across the South of England and from Join Demen-
tia Research (JDR; an online database for matching UK
community-dwelling individuals to relevant studies) to
take part in think-aloud interviews. We employed pur-
posive sampling whereby we attempted to obtain max-
imum variation in terms of gender, age, education level,
socio-economic status and cognitive performance score.
Participants were excluded if they were already reason-
ably physically active (score > 30 on Godin Leisure Time
Exercise Questionnaire [ 44]), had diagnosed dementia, a
severe uncontrolled mental health condition, or terminal
illness. As part of the screening process, participants
completed a brief cognitive assessment (online Baddeley
verbal reasoning task [ 45]), which determined whether
they were identified as a participant with ‘lower cognitive
performance ’or‘higher cognitive performance ’. Lower
cognitive performance was defined as a score falling
more than one standard deviation below the ‘normative
score ’on the Baddeley verbal reasoning task (i.e. in line
with definitions of AACD [ 46]) as determined by the
PROTECT cohort database; scores from a large ( n>
15,000) pre-existing cohort of older adults [ 47]. Al-
though this single test was not indicative of cognitive
impairment, this categorisation enabled us to sample
views from those with higher ( n= 20) and lower levels
(n= 21) of cognitive performance.
Procedure Each participant took part in one think-
aloud interview in which they worked through the
prototype Active Brains intervention with an interviewer.
The participant was encouraged to vocalise all immedi-
ate thoughts and feelings towards the content. This
allowed insight into target users ’immediate reactions toelements of the intervention. As it was unfortunately not
possible for participants to access the brain training
games, we provided screenshots to show the types of
task this involved. The Active Brains intervention pro-
vides access to brain training games via the PROTECT
study; these existing games have been extensively used
in ongoing cohort studies, and study investigators report
them being well liked and engaged with [ 11,47]. Follow-
ing the think-aloud interview, there were semi-
structured interview questions about participants ’gen-
eral views of the intervention: what they liked/disliked,
found helpful/difficult, would like to change, etc. All in-
terviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Analysis Data were analysed to understand user views on
the intervention content and inform potential changes. We
collated all positive and negative comments pertaining to spe-
cific intervention elements into a ‘table of changes ’(Additional
Table 3). After discussing the frequency and significance of
positive and negative comments , we coded the importance of
possible changes by deciding whether any amendment was
likely to enhance the persuasiveness, acceptability and likeli-
hood of changing behaviour [ 48]. For example, we considered
whether multiple people provided the same feedback; if the
potential change aligned with our guiding principles and/or
expert opinion; and whether theory and/or evidence suggested
the change would make the desired behaviour more likely.
We prioritised changes by their relevance to behaviour change
or ability to prevent disengagement. If changes were low-
priority, they were implemented only if relatively quick and
easy. Interviews continued alongside this analysis to allow it-
erative modification of content prior to the next batch of in-
terviews. Once it seemed that n o further important changes
were required, we considered that data saturation had been
reached [ 48].
Phase 2, part 2: retrospective qualitative feasibility study
Participants This second element of the qualitative work
commenced once the majority of prioritised modifications to
the prototype had been made. E ligibility, sampling and re-
cruitment procedures were the same as in the think-aloud
interviews. Eighteen older adults (12 female, mean age = 69.1
years, range 62 –76) took part, seven of whom had partici-
pated in the think-aloud interviews. The eighteen partici-
pants were classified evenly across the lower and higher
cognitive performance groups ( n= 9 in each group).
Procedure Participants were invited to use Active Brains
for three weeks (timings were ‘sped-up ’to allow access to
all sections) and were given a diary to keep notes about
their experiences. Participants took part in one semi-
structured interview each during this time. The interviewEssery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 5 of 16
asked participants about their experiences of engaging
with the intervention and any relevant activities they tried.
They were prompted to discuss certain features or ele-
ments that they particularly liked and/or found helpful or
disliked and/or found difficult. Towards the end, there
were questions about participants ’perceptions and under-
standings of cognitive health, and their views on social
support for engaging in new activities. All interviews were
audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Analysis All data were tabulated and analysed as de-
scribed in the think-aloud study (phase 2, part 2a). In
addition, inductive thematic analysis [ 49] was conducted
on the data from the second part of the interview exam-
ining perceptions and understandings of cognitive health
and social support (phase 2, part 2b).
Results
Phase 1: planning Active Brains
Phase 1, part 1: reviewing relevant literature
Given the wealth of existing reviews on the topics of
interest, the findings were not formally synthesised for
write-up. However, key findings pertinent to our re-
search aims are summarised in Table 1, which also illus-
trates how they informed intervention guiding
principles. Key findings included there being no substan-
tial evidence that the intervention ’s physical activity rec-
ommendations should differ for older adults with MCI/
AACD compared to a general older-adult population.
The cognitive training systematic review evidence sug-
gested training multiple cognitive-domains to be the
optimum choice for both cognitively-healthy older adults
and those with cognitive impairment e.g. [ 50,51]. Re-
garding physical activity interventions, those with and
without cognitive impairme nt shared similar attitudes
towards physical activity, and recognised similar bar-
riers (e.g. remembering, social isolation), facilitators
(e.g. accessibility of activity options, simple activities)
and preferred activities (e.g. walking) [ 52,53]. There
w a so n l yas m a l la m o u n to fe v i d e n c ea b o u ti n t e r v e n -
tion features that may be acceptable and engaging for
both groups. Acceptable intervention features amongst
those with cognitive impairment often overlapped
with those frequently used in interventions for older
adults in general e.g. planning features [ 54];. Other-
wise, there was little evidence about whether engage-
ment with intervention features was likely to differ
between groups, so we aimed to explore this within
our primary qualitative work.
Phase 1, part 2: development of guiding principles
The finalised Active Brains guiding principles (Table 1)
were minimising cognitive load and dependence on
technology; positive framing and promoting immediate-term quality of life benefits; and catering for heteroge-
neous preferences and capabilities. These guiding princi-
ples underpinned and informed the development of all
intervention materials both in terms of the content, and
also the presentation style, format and functionality.
Phase 1, part 3: developing Active Brains programme
theory
Phase 1, part 3a: behavioural analysis The full behav-
ioural analysis is presented in Additional Table 4.A c t i v e
Brains targeted nine behaviours: initial engagement with the
online intervention; increasing physical activity; reducing sed-
entary behaviour; uptake of strength and balance activities;
uptake of brain training; healthy changes to eating behav-
iours; reviewing behaviours and revising goals; integration of
recommended activities into da ily routines; and maintaining
engagement with the online intervention. These behaviours
were further broken down into 19 sub-behaviours required
to enact each behaviour. Mapping these behaviours, their de-
terminants and intervention features onto the BCW and
TDF illustrates that Active Brains employs 36 BCTs to de-
liver seven intervention functio ns (modelling, education, per-
suasion, training, enablement, environmental restructuring,
incentivisation) to target thirteen behavioural domains (in-
tentions, optimism, emotion, knowledge, skills, beliefs about
consequences, beliefs about capabilities, goals, social influ-
ences, environmental context an d resources, reinforcement,
memory, attention and decision processes and behavioural
regulation). This analysis prov ided an in-depth understand-
ing of the behaviours for Active Brains to target and the
mechanisms through which it is anticipated that these could
be changed. These understan dings informed the develop-
ment of the intervention ’s logic model.
Phase 1 part 3b: the Active Brains intervention logic
model A summary version of the Active Brains logic
model is shown in Fig. 2. Additional Figure 1shows the
full version with intervention processes mapped on to
BCW, TDF and BCTs. The culmination of the planning
phase in preliminary guiding principles and a logic
model provided the underpinning framework for Active
Brains. The Active Brains digital intervention comprises
three online modules that become available sequentially:
‘Active Lives ’(physical activity) is available immediately;
‘Brain Training ’(cognitive training) is available after 4
weeks; and ‘Eat for Health ’(healthy eating) is available
after 8 weeks. ‘Active Lives ’is further divided into three sub-
modules: ‘Getting Active ’,‘Strength and Balance ’and‘Breaks
from Sitting ’with recommendations about which to start
with tailored to users ’baseline activity and capability. Within
each module, users can access information addressing com-
mon concerns, instruction about recommended activities,
goal setting and review for chosen activities and tailoredEssery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 6 of 16
motivational feedback on progress. Reminder emails are sent
to motivate users to continue with their activities and to en-
courage them to revisit online content. Additional support
from a central facilitator (for one arm of Active Brains trial)
comprises up to three 10-min phone calls at 2-week inter-
vals, plus additional email support if required. This can be
used to discuss behavioural changes participants are attempt-
ing, and to support them with use of the online intervention
content. The facilitator employs the CARE (Congratulate,
Ask, Reassure, Encourage) approach to provide support in a
broadly standardised format [ 69]. After 7 months, the Active
Brains ‘booster section ’allows users access to additional re-
sources for embedding recommended activities into daily life.It also introduces the brain training ‘boosters ’to maintain
the benefits of the initial intensive training period.
Phase 2: optimising Active Brains
The findings of the qualitative work are described below.
These fed back into ongoing iteration of the guiding
principles, and behavioural analysis and also informed
required intervention changes.
Phase 2, part 1: think-aloud interviews
Feedback on the Active Brains prototype was encouraging
with largely positive feedback from participants ’indicating
that they found the content easy to understand, persuasiveTable 1 The Active Brains guiding principles
Key findings from literature Key design objective Intervention feature(s)
Older adults with cognitive impairment tend to
experience difficulties in the domains of memory,
language, thinking and judgement. Difficulties not so
extensive that the individual requires assistance with
activities of independent daily living [ 55,56]
Older adults with cognitive impairments that may affect
Internet use are still actively engaging with technology
[57]
Good evidence of effectiveness and/or acceptability of
various features/characteristics of interventions:
- Simple goal setting and action planning with clear
explanation of benefits/ importance [ 58]
- Reinforcement/encouragement for achievements [ 59]
- Self-monitoring of physical activity behaviours, e.g. using
a pedometer [ 58,60]
- Social support in the form of activity suggestions to be
done with others/ local group recommendations [ 59,
60]; social element of cognitive training may also be
beneficial [ 61]
- Promotion of autonomy [ 59]
Strength and balance exercises can be built into daily
routines and activities [ 62]Minimising cognitive load
and dependence on
technologyClear and simple layout, language and navigation
procedures
Support provided for cognitive self-regulation (e.g. plan-
ning, reminders, prompts for periodic short-term and
long-term self-monitoring)
Utilising non-cognitive/non-digital means of sustaining
behaviour (habit formation, environmental restructuring)
Options to print/ save key reference documents/
instructions wherever possible.
Link to existing non-digital sources of advice/ support
where appropriate, including peer/ family support if
possible
Individuals more motivated to participate in, and have
better recognition memory for, physical activity

Loss of independence perceived as key threat of
cognitive decline [ 64]
Older adults with cognitive impairments very interested
in programs offering computer exercises to improve
cognition as well as web-based interventions for a range
of health concerns and lifestyle factors, including physical
activity, diet and nutrition, social engagement [ 57]
Enjoyment of activities is important [ 52,53,65]
Different/new activities such as strength, flexibility and
balance exercise may be beneficial for long-term engage-

and interesting. Users were particularly positive about
what they considered to be more novel activities including
strength and balance training, and brain training games.
I thought it was actually really helpful, and I thought
it offered a really wide range of ways for people, start-
ing from different levels of activity, to think about
doing more. I also thought the parts that are the little
sections that said things like 'I'm concerned about
overdoing it', you know the sections about people's
concerns? I thought that the content of all of those
parts addressed the issues really clearly. (J0105, fe-
male, 65, higher cognitive performance)
I thought it was very good actually. I thought it was
excellent in fact. If only for the fact that it did, it re-
lated to me one hundred percent. It was completely
informative and helpful, you know, giving …giving
me the impetus to move on. (P0122, male, 73, lower
cognitive performance)
Less positive feedback included sections where users
found navigation confusing, a lack of specificity sur-
rounding physical activity goals, and a desire to address
health-related concerns earlier. We analysed feedback
for differences between those with lower and higher cog-
nitive performance scores to determine whether differ-
ent intervention features or characteristics may be more
engaging or desirable for those with lower cognitiveperformance. There was no evidence of any substantive
differences. Table 2summarises key feedback that re-
quired addressing and the resulting changes
implemented.
Phase 2, part 2: retrospective qualitative feasibility study
Phase 2, part 2a: table of changes analysis Collating
feedback from this later round of interviews into a second
table of changes confirmed that the amendments based on
the initial think-aloud interviews were well received, with
the original issues no longer being raised. Participants ’ac-
counts of their experiences also revealed examples of ways
in which they had engaged in the activities recommended
by the intervention and confirmed they were happy with
the digital delivery format.
It did make me think about it in general, and
reminded me that I'm not doing so much aerobic
activity, and I'm not really measuring my activity. So
I decided I would - there are about four flights of
stairs when I go to work, and I always used to walk
up them, and now I've got a bit lazy about it, so I
decided I was going to go back to that, and also use
an app to measure how much I walk, because I've
got a dog and I walk a lot every day. (P0129, female,
67, lower cognitive performance)

Active Brains
sectionSummary of issue identified Example Change implemented
Introductory
contentWorry about continuing before being
reassured that it would be safe to try new
activities with various health conditions/
other concerns“I would have it earlier, yeah, because the
question in itself is too sort of set, you
know, it, it ’s about increasing activity
gradually rather than overdoing it. And I
think something about that needs to go
before. (P0136)Although each subsection contained a
section addressing concerns, it was
deemed important to bring shared
concerns forward to the introductory
material so people felt happy to proceed
with the intervention content
Some pages (and this applied throughout)
perceived to be a bit cluttered/ busy with
too much text which some found off-
putting“I immediately look at this page and find it
untidy and as a, not a struggle, but as a
barrier there to reading it clearly and
understanding it. I ’m struggling to find
what to click to go to next. ”(P0245)Focusing on identified problematic pages,
we edited text to a minimum. Wherever
possible text was bullet-pointed and only
key messages retained. If important to
keep all text on a page, this was split over
multiple pages where appropriate.
Getting
ActiveUncertainty about goal setting: some
seemed unsure about exactly what they
had set themselves goals to do even when
goal setting process complete“…it’s good to have goals, but I think the
goals need to be specific. If you're asking
people to achieve a goal that's very vague,
I don't think they're enthusiastic and I
think they give up and they probably give
up the whole thing. ”(P0111)After revisiting the activity suggestions
made in this section, it was considered
that this uncertainty was likely to be
arising from the fact that the activity
suggestions and plans that people could
select were a little too broad —these were
amended to more specific options for
people to choose from
Many mistaking coloured, bolded text (to
emphasise key messages in text) for
hyperlinks and expected links to additional
content“…anything else that's in blue, you think
you can click on it ”(P0102)We removed the colouring of these parts
of text, but retained the bolding for
emphasis. The minimisation of text to key
messages only also addressed this issue.
Strength and
BalanceConcern that information provided about
the principles of how strength and balance
exercises worked (including information
about specific movements such as shifting
weight to one side) was potentially risky if
attempted by those who were less mobile.“…if you have somebody with poor
balance, it ’s just trying to ensure, how do
you ensure that someone who shouldn ’t
really be standing on one leg doesn ’t
stand on one leg, despite what you ’ve said
about being safe. ”(P0106)The text in this section was reframed to
describe the underlying principles of the
exercises without reference to specific
examples that may be dangerous if
attempted by someone with poorer
mobility/balance. Instead it now talks
about how the suggested activities allow
practice of movements to expand
individuals ‘comfort zone ’in terms of
movements they can make.
Disagreement with advice that if users are
unsure about whether suggested activities
are suitable for them, then to consult with
their GP –users not comfortable with the
idea of taking up GP time with these types
of queries.“It’s…I always find this information about
checking with your doctor before you start
interesting, because I very …well, I say
that. I very seldom make plans to go and
visit the doctor. And I certainly wouldn ’t
regarding this, I think. ”(P0105)Revised to reassure users that the activities
recommended were nothing outside of
routine movements made in day-to-day
life and that they were likely the best
judge of whether they could safely/com-
fortably do these Also encouraged to dis-
cuss with those who knew them well, and
only seek advice from GP for serious
concerns.
Breaks from
SittingSome activity plans about how to
implement recommendations deemed
unrealistic or ‘silly’—e.g. purposely leaving
objects upstairs that you know you will
need downstairs to increase steps around
the house“Leave your bedtime book on the kitchen
table. I don't get that one. How does that
work? You're just gonna pick it up when
you're downstairs and carry it to the
bedroom and then bring it back down …”
(P0101)Such examples were removed or replaced.
New suggestions focused on ways people
could: add some movement in to times
they might be completely sedentary (e.g.
leg raises whilst watching TV); add more
movement into standing or mostly
sedentary times (e.g. marching on the spot
whilst brushing teeth)
Some activities to identify common times/
places for sitting, were not considered
either: a) a suitable target for change (i.e.
at doctors surgery), or b) an activity that
they would actually do sitting down (e.g.
brushing teeth)“Yeah, I think if you stood up when you
were waiting to see a doctor or nurse …I
think you'd …people don't stand up, do
they? ”
(J0112)These suggestions were removed
Brain
TrainingThe wording of some True/False quiz
questions was considered confusing, e.g.
one stated that the purpose of brain
training games was to keep improving
your score. If/when people answered ‘True ’,
they were surprised when their answer“Yeah, well that ’s, that automatically to me
should be true but it ’s, you explaining it,
but it ’s not clear. The point of brain
training is for you to get better, any
training is to get better, but it said it ’s
false. ”(P0104)To ensure participants remained engaged
with these quiz questions and did not take
away the wrong message, wording/
feedback was revisited and amended
where necessary. In this example, the
feedback was clarified to state that whilst aEssery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 9 of 16
you should eat to help your brain. I found all
those very interesting. I don't think my diet is
that bad, but it's nice to know that I have been
eating the right things and things that I can add
too, to what I'm doing. I like the recipes. I'm
looking at the recipes, I did print those out.
(P0229, female, 68, higher cognitive perform-
ance)
But I mean somebody who hadn ’tg o ta n y[ I T ]
skills and were just having to read and have just
got a next or a back button, it is very easy to
use. You don ’t really need to do much, as long
as they know where the click on and off, and
move on. It ’sl i k et u r n i n gap a g eo ft h eb o o k ,
isn’ti t ?I t ’sa ss i m p l ea st h a t ,i s n ’ti t ?Y e s .
(P0104, female, 75, lower cognitive performance)
In general, there were a smaller number of negative
comments about the intervention content, but a fewremaining points were identified and addressed (Table 3).
There were no substantial differences in the views
expressed by individuals with higher and lower levels of
cognitive performance.
Phase 2, part 2b: inductive thematic analysis The in-
ductive thematic analysis generated three overarching
themes, comprising several subthemes. These were
(1)‘knowledge and understanding of brain health ’,i n -
cluding subthemes ‘the meaning of brain health ’,‘per-
ceived availability of information about brain health ’
and ‘knowledge of determinants of brain health ’;( 2 )
‘motivators and barriers ’, including the subthemes
‘motivations for achieving/maintaining good brain
health ’,‘motivators for engaging in helpful behaviours ’
and ‘barriers to engaging in helpful behaviours ’;a n d
finally (3) ‘t h er o l eo fs o c i a ls u p p o r t ’including sub-
themes ‘desirability of social support ’and ‘motiv-
ational mechanisms of social support ’.K e yf i n d i n g sTable 2 Summary of feedback and amendments resulting from think aloud interviews (Continued)

wasn ’t considered correct good aim to try and improve scores, the
important factor is continuing to practice
these games whether or not your score
improves
Given different structure of the Brain
Training section compared to other
sections, a page preceding the Brain
Training menu explained how to use
menu page, but this created confusion“It's a bit confusing, this one. I don't know
quite why. This bit I think might be more
beneficial on the next page? ”(J0112)This page was removed and the
navigation around the Brain Training menu
pages was revised to ensure that it was
clear how users could access each element
of the Brain Training module —most
importantly the link to the Brain Training
games.
Table 3 Summary of feedback and amendments resulting from retrospective interviews
Summary of issue identified Example Change implemented
Some voiced opinion that they felt physical
activity content wasn ’t relevant to them as they
perceived themselves to already be physically
active (despite not meeting exclusion criteria for
existing high levels of physical activity)“For me, it was the actual activities, the actual
physical bits, weren't terribly challenging. ”
(P0146)Additional messages added in to introductory
and early physical activity content to emphasise
that even those who are already active can use
content to help them increase activity, and to
stress importance of continuing with/ increasing
activities they already do and enjoy. Additional
signposting to aspects of content where users
have more free choice about the level of
challenge of their activities —e.g. writing their
own goals, resources for finding activity classes/
groups in their local area, and setting their own
strength and conditioning exercise plan,
A few suggestions that it would be useful to
have more explicit suggestions about ways to
stay motivated with making behavioural
changes —particularly about how to use social
support to do so“The one thing I think you could do a bit on is
finding the incentive to do all these things, so
that we've got to do them to keep going, but
you tend to put them off because you're doing
other things at the time. ”(P0265)Extra pages added to give examples of
motivational strategies, including ways to involve
others (e.g. weekly step-count competition with
friends/family) and activities to boost motivation
(e.g. ‘Reasons to be Active ’card).
Some perceived healthy eating content to be
largely in line with what they were already
doing. Furthermore, expert advice from within
the team recommended placing greater
emphasis on the ‘foods for brain health ’as
novel/interesting element.“I read it through with interest and I thought:
Oh, well, I do that; I eat that. I agree with all of
that and that's what I do; but there was
nothing in there that I felt that I didn't already
do.”(P0250)Restructure of the healthy eating content so that
the initial information and goal setting centres
around specific foods beneficial for cognitive
health, with additional more general healthy
eating advice presented after this.Essery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 10 of 16
from each theme are briefly summarised with illustra-
tive quotes from the data. These findings helped to
further refine the intervention guiding principles and
behavioural analysis.
Knowledge and understanding of brain health This
theme suggests that, for older adults, ‘good brain health ’
is largely about maintaining independence and
remaining able to do the activities one wishes to do.
More than half of participants also discussed retention
of specific cognitive skills such as good memory and
decision-making.
If you've got good brain health, then you can carry
on with your daily life: cooking, managing your
finances, managing your social life —you know, day-
to-day things, really. (P0229, female, 68, higher cog-
nitive performance)
A large proportion of individuals felt that, whilst infor-
mation about cognitive health and how to protect it is
available, it often requires one to actively look for it. Many
also mentioned the availability of information about body
health, but not necessarily about brain health.
So you do need to know about it. But you have to
make the effort to either read a newspaper or look
at the news, or get your brain active yourself.
(P0265, female, 69, lower cognitive performance)
Despite this, nearly three-quarters of participants
named typically promoted strategies for maintaining
cognitive health, such as brain training activities and
puzzles. Half of participants also acknowledged the role
of health-related behaviours, such as physical activity, in
maintaining cognitive health.
Motivators and barriers Two different types of motiv-
ation were identified within participants ’accounts.
The first were motivations to maintain good brain
health in order to avoid cognitive decline and its an-
ticipated negative consequences, such as loss of inde-
pendence, poor quality of life and interference with
relationships. This was often accompanied by ac-
counts of friends or family with dementia and their
strong wish to avoid this.
It’s a tremendous thing, for me anyway, because I've
seen other people go through it. I don't want to, [ …]
It is frustrating for other people as well as for your-
self. I think it's important not just for you, but it's
also important for the rest of the family, and to be
able to pass the memories on as well. (P0225, fe-
male, 65, lower cognitive performance)The second type of motivation related to factors that
encouraged individuals to engage in behaviours import-
ant for maintaining cognitive health. The overwhelming
sentiment was that enjoyment is the main motivator.
Even when individuals acknowledged that behaviours
were beneficial for brain health, this seemed an ‘added
bonus ’rather than the primary motivator.
…yeah, you know, I do a lot of things like maths
games. And crosswords and stuff like that every day,
so I don ’t know if that actually helps but I just find
them interesting. (P0138, male, 70, higher cognitive
performance)
Barriers to engaging in activities to support cognitive
health were not discussed extensively, but the most
common difficulty mentioned was managing other
health conditions.
I'm quite hampered with physical activity because
I've got arthritis and am registered disabled so, to be
honest, physical activity is so difficult for me. That's
where these exercises come in, really and it's mostly
what I can do. (P0261, male, 62, higher cognitive
performance)
The role of social support Participants who discussed
involving others in healthy lifestyle activities mentioned
several mechanisms through which this provided motiv-
ation for beginning and maintaining activities. This in-
cluded creation of action plans with others, being
accountable to others and sharing encouragement and
new ideas.
I think, if you're going swimming or something once
a week, it's nice if someone says, 'Are you ready to
go?' 'Shall we go today?' rather than you think: Oh, do
I really want to go today? If there's two of you or
three of you wanting to go, you encourage each other.
(P0229, female, 68, higher cognitive performance)
However, it was widely acknowledged that individuals ’
preferences and circumstances determine whether in-
volvement of others is possible, or even desirable. More
than half of participants expressed that they would be
happy (or sometimes prefer) to do such activities alone.
I’m quite happy with my own company. I mean, I
enjoy doing things with other people, and I go to
yoga and I get on with everybody there, and I've got
quite a few friends that go, but I would go whether
they went or not. (P0129, female, 67, lower cognitive
performance).Essery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 11 of 16
Discussion
This paper presents a theory-, evidence- and person-
based approach to intervention development that could
be applied across numerous behaviour change contexts.
We have provided a systematic account of how and why
the intervention took its current form, and how it is ex-
pected to work. In doing so, we have provided important
provisional insights into the likely acceptability of a
digital multi-domain intervention to reduce cognitive
decline amongst older adults with a range of cognitive
performance abilities. This forms the basis for further
work which will next explore the feasibility [ 70] of this
intervention amongst a much larger sample. Further-
more, this work illustrates the application of a systematic
process for intervention development that can be applied
widely.
Key outcomes from each component of this study col-
lectively provide preliminary evidence that a digital
multi-domain behaviour change intervention can be ac-
ceptable and engaging amongst UK community-dwelling
older adults. The study ’s embedded qualitative work
with intervention target users also allowed iterative opti-
misation of our draft content to ensure barriers to ac-
ceptability and engagement were identified and
addressed. Furthermore, our findings about older adults ’
perceptions of cognitive health facilitated understandings
of characteristics and features of intervention content
that would be important for acceptability and engage-
ment. These findings generally align with the existing lit-
erature: for example, maintaining independence [ 64] and
enjoyment of activities [ 65] seem key motivators
amongst this group. We also found that an awareness of,
and desire to avoid, the consequences of dementia
seemed to motivate cognition-protective behaviours
[71], whilst other health conditions arose as a possible
barrier. Additionally, our findings extend understandings
about the value of social support. Whilst they concur
that, for many, social support is an important motivator
of behaviours such as physical activity [ 60], they reveal
that for others it is not considered necessary or desir-
able. This has important implications for offering social
support within interventions, i.e. it should be available
but not a compulsory element. Furthermore, as social
support didn ’t appear to be a primary motivation for en-
gagement with the intervention, this lends additional
support to the potential feasibility and acceptability of a
digital-delivery format.
Our findings also reinforce and extend existing litera-
ture about the suitability of intervention content for in-
dividuals with varying levels of cognitive performance.
Importantly, we found no evidence of qualitative differ-
ences between those with higher and lower cognitive
performance scores regarding their preferences or re-
quirements for the Active Brains intervention, or theirability and willingness to engage with the digital inter-
vention. This finding reinforced our judgement (in-
formed by the initial literature review) that Active
Brains ’content and delivery-format may also be access-
ible and engaging for people with lower cognitive per-
formance scores and did not need to be tailored
according to cognitive status. This supports previous
findings [ 50,51], suggesting that the same activity rec-
ommendations might be suitable for those with and
without cognitive impairment, given that they appear to
share similar motivations, barriers, and attitudes. The
findings regarding the acceptability of the digital delivery
format also align with recent evidence that individuals
with MCI and even dementia still frequently use tech-
nologies such as smartphones and tablets [ 57,72]. These
key findings extend limited evidence about preferred
intervention features [ 54], by demonstrating that those
suitable for a general older adult population seem likely
to be engaging and acceptable for those with lower cog-
nitive performance scores too. These preliminary find-
ings will be explored further in the feasibility trial of the
Active Brains intervention [ 70].
Overall, our findings largely concur with the literature,
PPI input and co-investigator expertise that informed
our preliminary intervention guiding principles and be-
havioural analysis, and so largely confirmed the priorities
for intervention functions and features. The qualitative
data also provide valuable, detailed feedback that has in-
formed the optimisation of Active Brains to maximise
the likelihood of intervention engagement and effective-
ness. Whilst we will continue to explore these percep-
tions and experiences in relation to the Active Brains
intervention, these tentative insights may be of interest
more widely to those developing behaviour change inter-
ventions for older adults.
This paper addresses numerous calls to more clearly
articulate the intervention development process, and the
resulting intervention ’s expected mechanisms of action
[42]. It is important to test these mechanisms to provide
new evidence about behavioural determinants and the
most effective intervention functions to target them [ 42],
particularly in multi-domain interventions. This infor-
mation enables advancement of theoretical understand-
ings of behaviour change in diverse contexts [ 73]. The
extensive qualitative research is a further strength of this
rigorous intervention development process. The qualita-
tive interviews provided in-depth understanding of tar-
get users ’preferences and life-context to maximise
acceptability. These participants represent a wide-
ranging community-based group, purposively sampled
from JDR as well as primary care. As participants ’under-
standings of cognitive health were sought during the
period that they had access to Active Brains, their views
could have been influenced by their experience of theEssery et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:158 Page 12 of 16
intervention. However, these questions explored percep-
tions of cognitive health in a broad sense rather than
how they related to specific intervention content. Indeed,
participants ’responses more often involved accounts of
their own beliefs and experiences than reference to Ac-
tive Brains.
With the development of Active Brains now complete,
the next step is a feasibility trial ( n= 360, in progress) to
test the intervention and trial procedures. A fully pow-
ered trial ( n= 20,000) then aims to determine whether
the Active Brains intervention can successfully reduce
the incidence of dementia amongst older adults over a
5-year period. This systematic development process has
closely informed the planning of our later process evalu-
ation that will occur alongside the fully powered effect-
iveness trial. Specifically, it has helped to identify the
intervention ’s anticipated mechanisms of action (out-
lined in the logic model) and, in turn, has informed the
inclusion of specific process measures that will allow us
to test these mechanisms. This includes measures of
self-efficacy, social support, intrinsic motivation for tar-
get behaviours and perceptions of intervention usability.
Conclusions
This study has begun to address the need for a
rigorously-developed, low-cost, multi-domain behaviour
change intervention for maintaining older adults ’cogni-
tive health. It presents the theory-, evidence- and
person-based framework that arose from the planning of
the intervention, as well as the primary qualitative evi-
dence that helped to optimise acceptability of interven-
tion content and functionality. As well as facilitating
optimisation of intervention content, the qualitative data
contribute a greater understanding of older adults ’per-
ceptions of brain health, and the barriers and facilitators
to engaging in preventative behaviours. In doing so, this
study has provided preliminary evidence that a digitally
delivered intervention with minimal support appears ac-
ceptable and potentially engaging to older adults with
higher and lower levels of cognitive performance.
