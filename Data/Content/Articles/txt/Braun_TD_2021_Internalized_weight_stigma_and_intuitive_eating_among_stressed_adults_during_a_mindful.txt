ABSTRACT
Purpose: Internalized weight stigma (IWS) is common in the United
States of America across body weight categories, and is implicated
in the development of distress and unhealthy eating behaviors (e.g.
overeating, disordered eating) that can foster poor cardiometabolic
health. While emerging intervention research shows early promisein reducing IWS, long-term e ﬃcacy is unclear and novel strategies
remain needed. This analysis examined whether participation in a
mindful yoga intervention was associated with reduced IWS and
increased intuitive eating, an adaptive eating behavior, and
whether these changes correlated with each other or withchanges in mindfulness and self-compassion.
Methods: Participants were stressed adults with low fruit and
vegetable intake ( N= 78, 64.1% White, M. Body Mass Index 25.59
± 4.45) enrolled in a parent clinical trial of a 12-week mindful
yoga intervention. Validated self-report measures of IWS, intuitive
eating, mindfulness, and self-compassion were administered at
pre-treatment, mid-treatment (8 weeks), post-treatment (12
weeks), and 4-month follow-up (24 weeks).Results: Linear mixed modeling revealed signi ﬁcant improvements
in IWS and intuitive eating across the four timepoints ( p< .001).
Reduced IWS correlated with increased intuitive eating pre- to
post-treatment ( p= .01). Improved self-compassion and
mindfulness correlated with intuitive eating (both p= . 04), but not
IWS ( p= .74 and p=. 5 6 ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ).ARTICLE HISTORY

Conclusion: This study o ﬀers preliminary support for the hypothesis
that mindful yoga may promote intuitive eating and reduce IWS
among stressed adults with poor diet, and suggests that changes
in these factors may co-occur over time. Further investigation withcontrolled designs is necessary to better understand the
temporality and causality of these relationships.
Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identi ﬁer: NCT02098018 .
A recent international consensus statement expressed the alarming public health conse-
quences of social stigma directed towards people with obesity (i.e., weight stigma) ) and
its sequelae, meriting action and further research towards its mitigation (Rubino et al.,2020 ). Internalized weight stigma (IWS) refers to the application of weight-related
stereotypes towards oneself (i.e. self-stigma). Common across weight statuses, IWS is
implicated as a dual risk factor for eating pathology and weight gain, given its associ-ations with binge eating, emotional eating, and food addiction in diverse samples
(Pearl & Puhl, 2018 ). Yet, research examining e ﬀective interventions to reduce IWS
suggests limited e ﬃcacy (Pearl, Wadden, Bach, Tronieri, & Berkowitz, 2020 ), and little
work has examined protective factors that may mitigate IWS ’s adverse e ﬀects on behav-
ioral health. Such protective factors include mindfulness, implicated protective against
other forms of internalized stigma (e.g. mental illness self-stigma; Yang & Mak, 2016 ),
self-compassion, suggested in early research to be depleted by and/or protectiveagainst the e ﬀects of IWS and related factors (Braun et al., 2021a ; Webb & Hardin,
2015 ), and intuitive eating, referring to the recognition and honoring of endogenous
hunger and satiety cues (Tylka, 2006 ).
Intuitive eating comprises three facets: (a) eating primarily for physical rather than
emotional reasons, (b) unconditional permission to eat (as opposed to dieting or follow-
ing speci ﬁc dietary rules, which can lead to binging), and (c) reliance on internal hunger
and satiety cues (Tylka, 2006 ). Intuitive eating training is commonly o ﬀered in eating
pathology and non-dieting interventions (i.e. programs that promote behavioral health
independent of a focus on dieting or body weight) (Cli ﬀord et al., 2015 ) to combat the
eﬀects of IWS and the dieting mindset on negative a ﬀect and overeating that can
follow consumption of ‘bad’or‘forbidden ’foods (Mathieu, 2009 ). Growing, primarily
observational research suggests intuitive eating may improve body image (Keirns &
Hawkins, 2019 ) and o ﬀer protection against eating pathology, binge eating, and weight
gain while promoting adaptive dietary choices (Bruce & Ricciardelli, 2016 ; Warren,
Smith, & Ashwell, 2017 ).
Early research examining the links between IWS and intuitive eating suggests IWS
may be a risk factor for less intuitive eating. IWS predicted fewer gains in intuitive
eating among women in a healthy lifestyle program (Mensinger, Calogero, & Tylka,
2016 ), and in a cross-sectional study of college women, was associated with less intuitive
eating through lower body image ﬂexibility (i.e. accepting rather than avoiding negative
body image-related cognitions and a ﬀects) and marginally lower self-compassion (i.e.
treating oneself as a loved one might during pain or di ﬃculty) (Webb & Hardin,
2015 ). This ﬁnding aligns with growing evidence that self-compassion is inversely934 T. D. BRAUN ET AL.
associated with and potentially protective against the e ﬀects of IWS and related factors,
and may promote healthy diet and eating behaviors such as intuitive eating (Biber & Ellis,
2017 ; Braun, Park, & Gorin, 2016a ; Braun et al., 2021 ; Rahimi-Ardabili, Reynolds, & Var-
tanian, 2018 ; Wong, Knee, Neighbors, & Zvolensky, 2019 ). For instance, higher daily self-
compassion was linked to improved intuitive eating and body image in a recent daily
diary study (Kelly & Stephen, 2016 ). A self-compassionate response to emotional
diﬃculty, including IWS-related distress, may improve attentiveness to and meeting of
one’s emotional and physical needs and therefore, decrease IWS and/or intuitive eating.
A prerequisite to self-compassion is mindfulness –individuals must be mindful of
distress before responding with self-compassion (Germer & Ne ﬀ,2019 ;N eﬀ,2003 ).
Mindfulness has been consistently associated with healthier eating behaviors including
intuitive eating, less eating pathology, and improved body image (Sairanen et al., 2015 ;
Sala, Shankar Ram, Vanzhula, & Levinson, 2020 ; Warren et al., 2017 ). Mindfulness
may also protect against the adverse e ﬀects of internalized stigma on psychological well-
being (Chan & Leung, 2021 ; Yang & Mak, 2016 ). Further, intuitive eating training
emphasizes the importance of both mindfulness and self-compassion (Tribole &Resch, 2012 ). Thus, improvements in mindfulness and self-compassion may correspond
with those of intuitive eating and IWS. Yet to our knowledge, no prospective research has
yet examined associations between changes in these constructs over time.
Mindful hatha yoga –a form that emphasizes compassionate mindfulness of present-
moment experience (Cook-Cottone & Douglass, 2017 )–represents an optimal context in
which to examine prospective associations between changes in IWS and intuitive eating
with those of mindfulness and self-compassion. Hatha yoga (henceforth referred to asyoga) is an integrative mind –body practice with roots in ancient India that primarily
comprises breathing exercises, postures, meditation, and relaxation in present-day
United States of America (U.S.A.) and other countries (Desikachar, 1999 ; NCCIH,
2020 ). Yoga that is independent of explicit dietary prescription or principles has been
associated with healthy eating and weight maintenance (Kristal, Littman, Benitez, &
White, 2005 ; Lauche, Langhorst, Lee, Dobos, & Cramer, 2015 ; Watts, Rydell, Eisenberg,
Laska, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2018 ) and implicated as potentially e ﬀective in the comp-
lementary treatment of eating pathology (Borden & Cook-Cottone, 2020 ; Domingues
& Carmo, 2019 ; Neumark-Sztainer, 2014 ).
Mindful yoga promotes positive embodiment (i.e.
‘the ability to sense and feel through
the body in the present moment ’) (Cook-Cottone & Douglass, 2017 , p. 1) and the closely-
associated factors of mindfulness and self-compassion (Braun et al., 2016b ; Gaiswinkler
& Unterrainer, 2016 ; Riley et al., 2016 ; Shelov, Suchday, & Friedberg, 2009 ). Cox and
Tylka ( 2020 ) theorize that mindful yoga-related increases in mindfulness and self-com-
passion support the development of positive embodiment, including the embodied prac-
tice of intuitive eating. Further, improvement in eating pathology risk factors linked toIWS have been shown to improve during yoga, including self-objecti ﬁcation (i.e. the
process whereby individuals internalize sexual objecti ﬁcation of their bodies and evaluate
their body as an object that appears to others) (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997 ) and poor
body image (Borden & Cook-Cottone, 2020 ). Yet no research to our knowledge has
examined whether yoga practice is associated with reduced IWS, and only one cross-sec-
tional study has examined intuitive eating in any yoga-related context, ﬁnding that it
positively associates with factors related to positive embodiment (i.e., body satisfaction,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 935
body awareness, and body responsiveness) in a sample of regular female yoga prac-
titioners (Dittmann & Freedman, 2009 ).
As an initial step towards addressing these gaps, the present secondary analysis of a
pilot clinical trial examined changes in IWS and intuitive eating during participationin a 12-week mindful yoga program among stressed adults with poor diet. We hypoth-
esized participants would report decreased IWS (Hypothesis 1) and increased intuitive
eating (Hypothesis 2) at 12 weeks (post-treatment), and that these changes would bemaintained at 24 weeks (follow-up). We secondarily examined associations between
changes in these constructs from pre- to post-treatment, and hypothesized that
changes in IWS would be inversely correlated with those of intuitive eating (Hypothesis3). As a tertiary inquiry, we examined whether changes in mindfulness or self-com-
passion (both reported in our prior work; Park, Finkelstein-Fox, Sacco, Braun, &
Lazar, 2020 ) were associated with changes in intuitive eating (Hypothesis 4a and 4b,
respectively) and IWS (Hypothesis 5a and 5b, respectively).
Materials and methods
The results presented here comprise a second ary analysis of a parent study that assessed
changes in fruit and vegetable intake (primar y) and stress (secondary), reported else-
where (Braun et al., 2021b ;P a r ke ta l . , 2020 ). An additional aim of the parent study
was to examine the optimal dose of home yoga practice assignment on change indietary behaviors and stress. In addition to the 12-week in-person yoga intervention
delivered to all participants, participant s were randomly assigned to receive one of
three home yoga practice conditions: low practice (10 min. per day, six days per
week), high practice (40 min. per day, six days per week), and hybrid practice
(10 min. per day three days per week, and 40 min. per day three days per week).
Detail on home practice adherence and fr equency can be viewed in our published
work (Greenberg et al., 2018 ). Because the present study observed no group di ﬀerences
on the variables of interest in this study, th e reported analyses analyze all participants as
one group.
Participants
A total of 84 participants were enrolled, 78 of whom completed assessments for the
measures of interest and were retained in analysis. Most enrolled were female (70.5%),non-Hispanic (87%), and 4-year college educated (85.9%). Reported racial identities
included American Indian or Alaskan Native (1.3%), Asian (12.8%), Black or African
American (2.6%), Multiracial (11.5%), White (64.1%), Other (3.8%), or prefer not toreport (3.8%). Participants ’average Body Mass Index (BMI) was 25.59 ( SD= 4.45) and
most BMI categories were represented, ranging from 19.03 ( ‘Normal ’) to 39.9 ( ‘Class
II obesity ’), with an average age of 39.42 ( SD= 14.16).
Healthy, yoga-naïve participants self-identi ﬁed as stressed were recruited from two
sites and their surrounding comm unities in the Northeastern U.S. –ar u r a lp u b l i c
university and an urban academic medical ce nter. Inclusion criteria included being
23–67 years of age and self-report of feeling both ‘stressed ’(yes/no checkbox) and con-
suming 5 or fewer servings of fruits and vege tables/day (assessed through research936 T. D. BRAUN ET AL.
assistant query, with validated serving si ze prompts) (NIH National Heart Lung and
Blood Institute, 2013 ; Paxton, Strycker, Toobert, Ammerman, & Glasgow, 2011 ).
Exclusion criteria included factors that ma y impact diet or body weight, including cur-
rently trying to lose weight, an exercise regimen of more than 180 min per week (basedon Haskell et al., 2007 ), current diagnosis of psychiatric illness or prior eating disorder
diagnosis as determined by the MINI or SCID eating disorders module, signi ﬁcant
prior meditation or yoga experience (de ﬁned as ≥12 classes in last 3 years or more
than 20 classes in lifetime), and medication s that altered appetite. Medical conditions
that would limit the ability to exercise or do yoga, including BMI > 40, were also
excluded.
Procedures
Following initial baseline assessment of eligibility (T1), this study included three
additional assessment points at 8 weeks (T2; mid-treatment), 12 weeks (T3; post-treat-
ment), and 24 weeks (T4; follow-up). Participants were remunerated up to $100 for com-pleting study assessments ($25 per time-point) and received the yoga program for free.
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of University
of Connecticut and Massachusetts General Hospital, and monitored by Westat. The pro-tocol is registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( #NCT02098018).
Yoga intervention
The Kripalu yoga-based stress management intervention was designed to integrate yoga
practice with elements of yoga philosophy pertinent to self- and emotion-regulation (e.g.mindfulness, self-compassion) to decrease physiological arousal and enhance well-being.Details on the intervention, including the three home practice conditions, can be
reviewed in our prior work (Braun et al., 2021 ; Greenberg et al., 2018 ). Broadly, the
12-week intervention comprised two segments: ﬁrst, a manualized protocol consisting
of eight weekly 2-hour sessions on “hatha ”(since technically the entire intervention,
including philosophy components, were yoga), whereas the 90-min classes were hatha
yoga practices only. The initial eight-week protocol was created and piloted with theKripalu Center for Yoga and Health and was adapted for use with this population by
theﬁrst author, a certi ﬁed yoga therapist, with an experienced registered yoga instructor
with curriculum expertise. The intervention avoided any mention of diet, weight stigma,body image, eating behaviors, or weight loss/maintenance to avoid confounding the
primary outcome metric in the parent study (i.e. non-prescribed changes in fruit and
vegetable intake).
Measures
All measures were assessed at baseline (T1), mid-program (T2), 12 weeks (T3; post-treat-
ment), and 24 weeks (T4; follow-up).
Internalized weight stigma (IWS) was assessed with the 11-item Weight Bias Internal-
ization Scale-Modi ﬁed (WBIS-M) (Pearl & Puhl, 2014 ), a modi ﬁcation of the original
WBIS for use with persons of all body weights. Items are ranked on a 7-point LikertHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 937
scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7); higher scores indicate
greater internalized weight stigma. The measure produces a global score of internalized
weight bias (Durso, Latner, & Ciao, 2016 ), conceptually paralleling the construct of inter-
nalized weight stigma. The WBIS-M has demonstrated adequate internal consistency andpredictive validity. In the present study at T1, alpha was 0.90.
Intuitive eating was assessed with the 23-item Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) (Tylka,
Van Diest, & M, 2013 ), a revision of the original 21-item IES (Tylka, 2006 ). Items are
ranked on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree
(5); higher scores indicate higher intuitive eating. The IES-2 produces subscales and
an overall intuitive eating score, the latter reported here. Prior research has indicatedstrong internal consistency reliability and validity of the IES-2 (Tylka, 2006 ; Tylka,
Van Dienst, & M, 2015 ). In the present study at T1, alpha was 0.90.
Mindfulness was measured in this secondary analysis using the Acting With Aware-
ness (AWA) subscale of the 24-item Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, short form
(FFMQ-SF) (Bohlmeijer, ten Klooster, Fledderus, Veehof, & Baer, 2011 ), a brief
version of the original 39-item FFMQ (Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney,2006 ). The AWA subscale was selected due to its strong association with the Mindful
Attention Awareness Scale, a unidimensional measure of mindfulness (Baer et al.,
2006 ; Brown & Ryan, 2003 ). Item responses range from never or very rarely true (1) to
very often or always true (5); higher scores delineate greater mindfulness. The AWA sub-
scale has demonstrated good reliability and validity (Bohlmeijer et al., 2011 ). Within this
sample at T1, alpha was 0.82.
Self-compassion was assessed with the 12-item Self-Compassion Scale, Short-Form
(SCS-SF) (Raes et al., 2011 ), a brief version of the original 26-item SCS (Ne ﬀ,2003 ).
Item responses range from almost never (1) to almost always (5); higher scores denote
greater self-compassion. The SCS-SF yields six subscales (self-kindness, self-judgment,common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, over-identi ﬁcation) and a global score, the
latter used in the present analysis. Good internal consistency was shown for the SCS-
SF global score in the validation study (Raes et al., 2011 ). Within this sample at T1,
alpha was 0.88.
Data analyses
The parent study was conservatively powered ( N= 134, accounting for 20% drop-out),
based on preliminary data (Salmoirago-Blotcher, Morgan, Fischer, & Carmody, 2013 ).
Our enrollment volume fell short and the study was underpowered ( N= 77 across
both sites with baseline survey data in the present analysis). Normality of numerical
study variables was examined, followed by computation of scale reliabilities, descriptivestatistics, and bivariate correlations. Independent t-tests and Pearson ’s chi-square tests
were used to assess baseline di ﬀerences between intervention completers vs. non-comple-
ters and assessment completers vs. non-completers. For these preliminary analyses, analpha level (type 1 error rate) of .05 and complete case analysis were used.
Appropriate analyses for Hypotheses 1 and 2 –examination of change in internalized
weight stigma (IWS) and intuitive eating over time –was determined via graphical
analysis of distributions across time-points. To account for within-subject correlationand provide estimates for changes over time, longitudinal analyses used random938 T. D. BRAUN ET AL.
intercept linear mixed-e ﬀects models (LMM) and a compound symmetry covariance
structure in SPSS 25.0. This method uses maximum likelihood methods of parameter
estimation and does not require complete cases (Jennrich & Schluchter, 1986 ). Time
was examined as a categorical predictor. Where e ﬀects by time were signi ﬁcant, to deter-
mine whether the yoga intervention was associated with improved outcomes within the
LMM, baseline scores (T1) were contrasted with those at 12 weeks (T3), with additional
changes at 24 weeks (T4) assessed by contrasting T3 and T4 scores. The Bonferroniadjustment for multiple comparisons was applied to these analyses ( p<.03). Analyses
covary for sex and site because the randomization procedure in the parent study strati ﬁed
participants by these variables, as well as age, given evidence that IWS and dietary factorsrelated to intuitive eating may di ﬀer by age (Marvin-Dowle, Kilner, Burley, & Soltani,
2018 ; Pearl & Puhl, 2018 ). Because analyses computed with and without outliers
yielded similar results, outliers were included in analyses.
To test associations between changes in intuitive eating and IWS (Hypothesis 3) as
well as correlations of these factors with mindfulness (Hypothesis 4a, b) and self-com-
passion (Hypothesis 5a, b) from pre- (T1) to post-treatment (T3), we ﬁrst generated stan-
dardized residualized change scores by regressing post-treatment T3 scores on T1 scoresfor each construct, controlling for sex, site, and age. We then examined whether changes
in intuitive eating and IWS correlated with each other and mindfulness or self-com-
passion by computing Pearson ’s correlations on these residualized change scores. For
correlation analyses, alpha level was set at p<.05.
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Massachusetts General
Hospital (#2013P001153) and the University of Connecticut (#H14-215).
Results
Participants
No di ﬀerences in pre-treatment constructs were observed between assessment completers
and non-completers at any timepoint ( p> .05). Sixty-seven percent of study participants
(n=56) completed the intervention (i.e. attended 5 or more classes), of whom 42 completed
post-treatment and 40 completed follow-up assessments for IWS. Information on study
attrition and completion rates are detailed in the CONSORT diagram, Figure 1 . Descriptive
statistics for constructs at each time-point are displayed in Table 1 .
Exploring change in IWS (Hypothesis 1) and intuitive eating (Hypothesis 2) over
time
To probe temporality of signi ﬁcant changes in IWS and intuitive eating across time
within the linear mixed model (see Data Analysis section), we contrasted pre-treatment
(T1) scores with post-treatment (T3) scores, and maintenance of change by contrastingT3 and follow-up (T4) scores.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 939
Detailed results including e ﬀects of time and corresponding contrasts are shown in
Table 2 .
There were signi ﬁcant main e ﬀects of time across the four timepoints on increasing
intuitive eating and decreased IWS (both p< .001). From T1 to T3, contrasts revealed
increased intuitive eating ( p= .01), and no signi ﬁcant change in IWS ( p= .24). Mainten-
ance contrasts from T3 to T4 revealed a further signi ﬁcant increase in intuitive eating ( p
= .03) and a signi ﬁcant decrease in IWS ( p= .01). Study site had a marginal e ﬀect on IWS.

Exploring the association between change in IWS and intuitive eating
(Hypothesis 3), and of each factor with change in mindfulness (Hypothesis 4a,
4b) and self-compassion (Hypothesis 5a, 5b)
All reported analyses utilize residualized change scores (see Data Analyses section). From
pre- to post-treatment, decreased IWS was associated with increased intuitive eating, r
(38) = -.43, p= .01. Increased mindfulness and self-compassion were both associated
with increased intuitive eating, r(38) = .33, p= .04 and r(38) = .33, p= .04, respectively.
Changes in mindfulness and self-compassion were unrelated with those in IWS, r(38)
= -.14, p= .38 and r(38) = -.15, p= .36, respectively.
Discussion
Internalized weight stigma (IWS) is incre asingly implicated as a key contributor to
poor mental, behavioral, and physical health , including eating disorders and poor car-
diometabolic health, and approaches to miti gate its impact are sorely needed (Hunger,
Dodd, & Smith, 2020 ;P e a r l&P u h l , 2018 ;S c h v e y&W h i t e , 2015 ). Intuitive eating
may prove a therapeutic target to reduce IWS (Cli ﬀord et al., 2015 ), and yoga may
prove a novel vehicle for targeting improv ement in both factors. Our study observed
improvement in IWS and intuitive eating ac ross the 16-week stud yt i m e f r a m ea m o n g
stressed adults reporting poor diet, with p reliminary evidence that these changes were
related over time. It is notable that these associations were observed in a yogaprogram that avoided any mention of diet, eating behaviors, weight stigma, body
image, or weight loss/maintenance –consistent with a weight-inclusive (i.e. non-
dieting, as opposed to weight-normative orweight loss focused) approach to health(Tylka et al., 2014 ).
Hypotheses 1 was primarily supported. IWS decreased, however, this change was only
signiﬁcant at follow-up (from T3 to T4), suggesting potentially delayed bene ﬁt of yoga
participation. Intervention research suggests IWS can be challenging to change long-term (Pearl et al., 2020 ), and it is possible that more enduring changes in this constructTable 2. Results of Linear Mixed Models predicting constructs by time, covarying for age, gender, and

related to yoga intervention accrue over a longer timeframe, and/or have delayed bene ﬁt.
The yoga intervention assessed in the present study emphasized use of yoga postures,
breathing exercises, and meditation ‘oﬀthe mat ’in stressful life situations, which may
have accrued practice e ﬀects that took longer than the 12-week study duration to
show. It is also possible that those who continued to practice yoga during the follow-
up period were those who experienced delayed bene ﬁt. Future research would bene ﬁt
from assessing continuation of yoga practice during the follow-up timeframe to assesswhether it contributes to outcomes. Hypothesis 2 was also supported, suggesting yoga
participation may foster intuitive eating among stressed adults with poor diet and that
beneﬁts may continue to accrue in the twelve weeks subsequent to treatment.
Reductions in IWS corresponded with increases in intuitive eating, supporting
Hypothesis 3. Changes in IWS and intuitive eating over time may be reciprocal and/or
interactive. While intuitive eating is clinically conceptualized as protective against the
eﬀects of IWS on behavioral health (e.g. Mathieu, 2009 ; Tribole & Resch, 2012 ), some
evidence also suggests that high IWS may be a riskfactor for low intuitive eating (Men-
singer & Meadows, 2017 ; Webb & Hardin, 2015 ). Reductions in IWS may disrupt dichot-
omous cognitions and self-judgment related to maladaptive eating behaviors, food, and/or diet, thereby decreasing unhealthy dieting practices or disordered eating behaviors,
and increasing intuitive eating. Alternately and complementarily, perhaps adoption of
a more intuitive eating style mitigates self-stigma and self-criticism associated withIWS and the development of disordered eating behaviors. Future research would

mination of temporality and causality between these factors within the naturalenvironment such as Ecological Momentary Assessment, including among yoga
practitioners to elucidate whether such changes are related to mindful
yoga practices or non-speci ﬁc factors.
Ourﬁnding that increased mindfulness and self-compassion associates with increased
intuitive eating (supporting Hypotheses 4a, 5a) extends observational research ﬁndings
linking these factors (Sairanen et al., 2015 ; Webb & Hardin, 2015 ). These results also
oﬀer preliminary support of Cox and Tylka ’s(2020 ) theoretical model, which posits
mindfulness and self-compassion are key contributors to positive embodiment, including
the embodied practice of intuitive eating. Yet Hypotheses 4b and 5b were unsupported.
Improvement in mindfulness and self-compassion did not correlate with reduced IWS,despite strong theoretical rationale and negative associations between self-compassion
and IWS in prior cross-sectional research (Braun et al., 2021 ; Hilbert et al., 2015 ;
Webb & Hardin, 2015 ). One explanation relates to our stressed sample, which excluded
individuals with clinically elevated psychiatric symptoms, a history of psychopathology
(including eating pathology), and those seeking to lose weight, all factors connected to
elevated IWS (Pearl & Puhl, 2018 ). Mean levels of IWS in our sample were low relative
to the cut point used to identify individuals with high IWS (2.7 vs. 4.0) (Pearl et al., 2020 ).
Mindfulness and/or self-compassion may be most strongly linked to reduced IWS in
samples that experience elevated IWS-related negative a ﬀect, such as individuals with
eating pathology, or those who experience heightened weight-related discriminationand IWS (Braun et al., 2021a
; Hilbert et al., 2015 ; Braun et al., 2016a ). It also is possible
that mindfulness and/or self-compassion may play an exogenous, mediating, or moder-
ating role in the associations between intuitive eating and IWS, an interesting topic for942 T. D. BRAUN ET AL.
future research. Better understanding how change in these factors may correspond with
IWS and intuitive eating change during mindful yoga will inform future research, pre-
vention, and intervention development e ﬀorts.
Clinical implications
Although the present study cannot be generalized to clinical samples, clinicians and
researchers who seek to examine yoga as an approach to reduce IWS among those
with heightened levels, including people with eating disorders and poor cardiometabolichealth (Hunger et al., 2020 ; Pearl & Puhl, 2018 ; Schvey & White, 2015 ), would bene ﬁt
from carefully considering the approach and methodology (Cook-Cottone & Douglass,
2017 ). Emerging evidence implicates chronic discrimination –such as weight stigma –
in the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms (Alessi, Martin, Gyamerah, &Meyer, 2013 ; Cheng & Mallinckrodt, 2015 ). Further, some research suggests certain
forms of yoga may exacerbate, rather than alleviate, eating pathology (Cox, Ullrich-
French, Cook-Cottone, Tylka, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2020 ; Domingues & Carmo, 2019 ,
2020 ), and care has been suggested to curate yoga spaces that facilitate positive embodi-
ment (Cook-Cottone & Douglass, 2017 ). Therapeutic yoga is thus recommended that
integrates a trauma-sensitive and identity-inclusive approach while emphasizing mind-fulness and self-compassion, celebration of all body shapes and sizes, and inclusion of
adaptations for all abilities (Cook-Cottone & Douglass, 2017 ; Emerson, 2015 ; Webb,
Rogers, & Thomas, 2020 ). Additionally, due to elevated levels of shame and weight-
related rejection sensitivity among people who experience weight stigma and heightenedIWS (Hunger et al., 2020 ; Mensinger, Tylka, & Calamari, 2018 ), therapeutic yoga classes
delivered in a virtual delivery format (i.e. telehealth) may yield initial enhanced accept-
ability and increase access and uptake.
An additional component of the broader system of yoga is the s a t t v i cy o g ad i e t ,a sa r t i c u -
lated in yogic texts such as the Gheranda Samhitha (Desai, 1990; Saraswati, 2012). A sattvic
yogic diet has been described as a ‘lacto-vegan nutritionally balanced, low fat, moderate
protein, high complex carbohydrate diet ’that includes ‘fresh non-processed food with
minimal non-irritating spices and condiments, and very easy to digest ’(Yogendra et al.,
2004, Appendix 1). The intervention excluded the sattvic yogic diet given the parent
study ’s aim to determine whether integrated hatha yoga practices, excluding dietary rec-
ommendations, promote implicit improvement in diet, as well as the appropriate corre-
sponding dose. Including a dietary change c omponent would thus have confounded this
primary outcome. Future resea rch is warranted to clarify associations between a sattvic
yogic diet and intuitive eating in the contex t of what has been termed "yoga bod" culture
Webb et al., 2017), as well as eating pathology and or thorexia, in diverse populations.
Limitations
Several limitations should be noted. The single-group research design does not allow for
any causal inference of these results; it is unknown whether results represent e ﬀects
related to the yoga intervention, regression to the mean, or non-speci ﬁc factors.
Results at best aid the generation of hypotheses for future research that should be exam-ined in longitudinal and randomized controlled trials to elucidate temporality andHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 943
causality. Moreover, because this study took place as part of a Kripalu yoga-based stress
management intervention, it is unknown if these same relationships would exist in other
yoga interventions which do not incorporate aspects of physical activity, positive embo-diment, or mindfulness and self-compassion.
A related challenge in yoga research with multicomponent interventions is determin-
ing which speci ﬁc factors contribute to bene ﬁcial change, given the widespread hetero-
geneity in such interventions. For instance, deep breathing, physical activity,mindfulness, and self-compassion alone are shown to contribute to many positive out-
comes. Our parent clinical trial was designed as a ﬁrst step towards understanding
whether dietary change is observed during yoga, and the optimal ‘dose ’for such
changes, rather than a test of which intervention components contributed to changes.
Future research would bene ﬁt from careful consideration of appropriate attention-
and contact-matched control groups to aid elucidation of unique and shared outcomesas well as pathways through which multicomponent yoga interventions may impact
behavioral health. Approaches such as the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST)
that are designed to identify the speci ﬁc and most e ﬃcacious intervention components
would be ideal for this purpose (Collins, Murphy, Nair, & Strecher, 2005 ). Researchers
may also consider use of the Essential Properties of Yoga Questionnaire (EPYQ), in
development during this study, to characterize multicomponent yoga interventions
and examine which components are most associated with bene ﬁcial change (Park
et al., 2018 ).
Additionally, despite the use of diverse images in marketing materials, our sample was
mostly White, non-Hispanic women with at least a college education who met extensiveexclusion criteria, limiting external validity. These characteristics mirror much of yoga
intervention and clinical trials research and warrant careful consideration in designing
future recruitment plans (see Spadola et al., 2017 ,2019 ; Webb et al., 2020 for promoting
greater diversity in future yoga research). Relatedly, this study did not assess sexual orien-tation or gender identity, a regrettable limitation given health disparities, including elev-
ated rates of eating disorders, among people who identify as sexual or gender minorities
(Kamody, Grilo, & Udo, 2020 ; Valdiserri, Holtgrave, Poteat, & Beyrer, 2019 ).
Other limitations of the study include a high drop-out rate (which may indicate that
our completers were unusually motivated), suggesting potentially biased results if these
self-selected responders felt they learned more from the program than non-responders.Relatedly, the small sample size left the study underpowered to detect small e ﬀect sizes.
While the LMM analyses were used in part to minimize the e ﬀect of missing data and
optimize use of all available data, future work should rectify these gaps, including useof larger sample sizes to increase power. Last, our sample excluded all individuals with
a history of eating pathology or actively seeking to lose weight, limiting generalization
to these populations and underscoring the importance of future work in this area.
Conclusion
Our pilot trial observed stressed adults with poor diet to report reduced internalized weightstigma (IWS) and increased intuitive eating following a yoga intervention, with thesechanges associated over time. Further, changes in mindfulness and self-compassion associ-ated with those of intuitive eating. However, the sequence of temporality and causality of944 T. D. BRAUN ET AL.
these changes remain unknown. While caution is warranted in interpretation of ﬁndings
due to the single-group design, pending continued research, yoga may emerge a cost-
eﬀective tool to promote healthy eating behaviors and improve poor biobehavioral and
metabolic health in high-stress populations at increased risk of chronic lifestyle diseases.More research, especially with diverse groups and using controlled designs, is warranted.
