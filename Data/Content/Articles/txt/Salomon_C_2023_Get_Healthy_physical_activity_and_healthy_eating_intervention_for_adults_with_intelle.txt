Abstract 
Background People with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience high rates of lifestyle related morbidities, in part due 
to lack of access to tailored health promotion programmes. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and preliminary 
efficacy of a tailored healthy lifestyle intervention, Get Healthy!
Methods Get Healthy! is a 12-week physical activity and healthy eating programme designed to address lifestyle-
related risks for adults with mild-moderate ID. The feasibility pilot was designed to assess subjective participant experi-
ence and programme feasibility across: recruitment and screening, retention, session attendance and engagement, 
adverse events, and practicality and reliability of outcome procedures. Exploratory programme efficacy was assessed 
across the following measures: anthropometry (body mass index, weight, waist circumference), cardiovascular fitness, 
physical strength, dietary intake, healthy literacy, and quality of life.
Results Six participants with moderate ID and two carer participants completed the feasibility trial, representing 
a 100% retention rate. Qualitative data indicated the programme was well received. Participants with ID attended 
75% of sessions offered and displayed a high level of engagement in sessions attended (91% mean engagement 
score). While most data collection procedures were feasible to implement, several measures were either not feasi-
ble for our participants, or required a higher level of support to implement than was provided in the existing trial 
protocol. Participants with ID displayed decreases in mean waist circumference between baseline and endpoint 
(95% CI: − 3.20, − 0.17 cm) and some improvements in measures of cardiovascular fitness and physical strength. No 
changes in weight, body mass index, or objectively measured knowledge of nutrition and exercise or quality of life 
were detected from baseline to programme endpoint. Dietary intake results were mixed.
Discussion The Get Healthy! programme was feasible to implement and well received by participants with moderate 
ID and their carers. Exploratory efficacy data indicates the programme has potential to positively impact important 
cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist circumference, cardiovascular fitness, and physical strength. Several of the 
proposed data collection instruments will require modification or replacement prior to use in a sufficiently powered 
efficacy trial.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• There was uncertainty regarding the feasibility of 
implementing the Get Healthy! group programme 
for adults with mild-moderate ID, and whether the 
selected outcome measures could be reliably admin -
istered to the population.
• The Get Healthy! programme was feasible to imple -
ment, however, several outcome measures required 
a greater level of training/support to administer than 
was provided in the feasibility protocol, and a small 
number were too complex for the participants with 
moderate ID.
• The Get Healthy! programme will be feasible to 
administer in a sufficiently powered trial; however, 
several screening and outcome measures will require 
modification prior to trial commencement.
Background
Despite significant advances in longevity and quality of 
life, people with intellectual disabilities (ID) continue 
to experience poorer health outcomes than the general 
population [1]. The term ‘intellectual disability’ is used 
to describe any person who experiences ‘significant limi -
tations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive 
behaviours, as expressed in conceptual, social and prac -
tical adaptive skills. The disability presents or originated 
during the developmental period before the age of 18 
years’ [2]. Many causes of premature mortality in this 
population are linked to potentially preventable condi -
tions [3]. Lifestyle risks including poor diet quality [4], 
low levels of physical activity [5], and high rates of sed -
entary behaviour [6], are prevalent across age groups. 
People with ID are more likely than the general popu -
lation to be overweight or obese and have high rates of 
type 2 diabetes and lipid abnormalities [7, 8]. Common 
prescribing of high cardiometabolic liability psychotrop -
ics in this population [9] further exacerbates risk. Health 
status, quality of life and health expenditure are all nega -
tively impacted by this high prevalence of lifestyle-related 
diseases [10, 11].
Tackling lifestyle-related behaviour has been identified 
as a priority area for improving health outcomes for peo -
ple with ID [12]. However, people with ID still have low 
levels of engagement in health promotion initiatives and 
preventative screenings [1]. Financial, physical, social and disability related barriers limit this population’s ability 
to access health promotion programmes available to the 
general population [13]. The limited and inconsistent ID 
health training received by the medical and allied health 
workforce [14, 15] means that many care providers lack 
confidence tailoring health promotion practices to the 
unique needs of this group.
There is also a lack of clarity regarding the essential 
components of lifestyle change interventions most likely 
to improve health outcomes. Evidence for the efficacy 
of general population healthy lifestyle programmes is 
robust [16]; however, these programmes are not neces -
sarily generalisable to people with ID. Results from ID 
population-specific interventions reported in the lit -
erature are limited and have had mixed results. Weight 
loss for adults with ID, for example, has been inconsist -
ently reported across interventions, but appears to be 
most likely in the context of multi-modal interventions 
encompassing physical activity, dietary and behaviour 
change components—see [17] for a review. Methodologi -
cal weaknesses, use of varied outcome measures and dif -
fering population characteristics (i.e. level and cause of 
ID, age-group, gender, living arrangements) across stud -
ies limits comparison of findings [18]. A meta-analysis of 
randomised-controlled healthy lifestyle trials for adults 
with ID showed statistically significant improvements in 
waist circumference only [18].
Further trials are needed to clarify the core compo -
nents of interventions that will promote engagement and 
positive lifestyle change in this population. The primary 
aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of implement -
ing a tailored healthy lifestyle programme, Get Healthy! 
with adults with mild-moderate ID. The secondary study 
aim is to explore potential programme efficacy. Results 
from the feasibility pilot will be used to refine the pro -
gramme content and data collection protocol prior to 
undertaking a sufficiently powered efficacy trial.
Background to the ‘Get Healthy!’ programme
Get Healthy! is a 12-week multi-modal lifestyle interven -
tion programme focusing on physical activity and healthy 
eating for adults (40 + years) with mild to moderate ID, 
however is suitable for all adults with ID. The programme 
was developed by a consortium of topic experts in the 
fields of nutrition, ID, ageing, exercise physiology, nurs -
ing, psychiatry, and psychology. A series of focus groups 
with adults with ID  and their paid carers [19] contrib -
uted consumer input to the programme design. Table  1

Methods
The full feasibility pilot protocol has been published 
elsewhere [20]. Methodology is summarised below for 
convenience.
Recruitment
Participants were recruited through disability service 
providers proximal to the healthy lifestyle centre where 
the intervention was delivered in metropolitan NSW, 
Australia. Adults who were identified by carers/disability 
organisations as having mild to moderate ID and con -
cerns about cardiometabolic health were eligible to par -
ticipate in the programme. The participants’ main carers 
were also invited to participate either independently 
in the full programme (carer-protocol A) or as a sup -
port person to the enrolled participants with ID (carer-
protocol B). Participants who were non-ambulatory, had 
severe-profound ID, or who were not cleared by their 
general practitioner (GP) to participate due to either high 
physical or psychiatric risk, were excluded.
Consent
Written informed consent was obtained from all par -
ticipants prior to trial commencement. For participants 
who lacked capacity to consent (~ 70%), written consent 
was provided by their legal guardian/carer as required by law. All participants with ID also obtained a signed 
medical clearance from their GP prior to enrollment. 
The study was conducted in accordance with the ethics 
approval granted by the UNSW HREC (Approval num -
ber: HC17471).
Data analysis
Programme feasibility was assessed across the domains 
of recruitment and screening, retention, adverse events, 
session attendance and session engagement. Every ses -
sion the programme facilitators recorded attendance 
and scored attendees based on their level of engagement 
in the session (0 = did not attend, 1 = participated mini -
mally, 2 = participated moderately well to very well). At 
the completion of the intervention combined scores 
for every session attended were used to categorise par -
ticipants into high (75–100%), medium (50–74%) or low 
engagement (< 50%) groups. Subjective participant expe -
rience was gathered in audio-recorded semi-structured 
exit interviews with all participants. Qualitative data 
from exit interviews was transcribed and thematically 
organised using the software programme NVivo (version 
11.0.0).
All outcome measures included in the trial are listed 
in Table  2. The Statistical Package for Social Science 
(SPSS) was used to analyse percentages, score means 
and/or frequencies where relevant. Acknowledging 
the small sample, we used 95% confidence intervals 
to reported outcomes in order  to provide a clinically Table 2 Clinical outcome measurements/procedures used in the ‘Get Healthy!’ feasibility trial

relevant indication of the direction of the effect being 
measured.
Food intake data was calculated from photographic 
food and drink records at baseline and endpoint. Data 
was interpreted and analysed by two Accredited Prac -
ticing Dietitians using Foodworks® (version 9) nutri -
tion analysis software (Xyris Software, 2018). Days 
with less than three meals captured were removed 
prior to analysis. A Healthy Eating Index for Austral -
ian Adults (HEIFA) [21] was then applied to determine 
overall diet quality.
Results
Six participants with ID and two carer participants 
completed the full screening process and were enrolled 
in the trial.
Participant demographics
Table  3 summarises demographics of participants with 
ID.
Carer participant demographics
Due to competing time commitments and variations 
in work schedules no family members or paid carers 
were able to enrol in the full programme (carer-option 
A). Two paid carers enrolled in the option B partici -
pation pathway. This participation pathway involved 
attending sessions in a support capacity as able. Both 
enrolled carer participants were female, over 18 years 
of age, and employed as paid disability staff. They sup -
ported several of the participants with ID in residen -
tial and day care settings. On average, these carers 
attended approximately 50% of the available sessions. 
Since carer protocol B did not include collection of 
outcome measures data, all efficacy data reported 
below pertains to the participants with ID only Table  4.Feasibility outcomes
Recruitment and screening
Recruitment was completed between July 2017 and Feb -
ruary 2018. Thirty people with ID expressed an initial 
interest in participating in the trial programme. Of these, 
14 were either unable to complete the consent form, or 
unable to determine a suitable time to attend the initial 
assessment. Sixteen participants completed the consent 
form and participated in the initial assessment. Ten par -
ticipants dropped out during this screening process. Rea -
sons for drop-out during the screening process included:
• Scheduling and/or transport problems (n = 7)
• Having a level of ID (severe to profound) that meant 
the person was unable to participate in the group 
learning structure of the ‘Get Healthy!’ programme 
(n = 3).
GPs screened each of the remaining six participants and 
provided signed consent for their participation in the fea -
sibility trial (Fig.  1). Recruitment was ceased in February 
2018 (6 months) in accordance with the funding allocated.
Retention rate
All six participants with ID who completed the full 
screening process and enrolled in the study went on to 
complete the programme, representing a 100% retention 
rate.
Attendance and session engagement
On average, participants with ID attended 75% of ses -
sions offered as part of the programme. Attendance 
rates at physical activity and nutrition sessions were 
similar (74% and 76% respectively). The top reason 
participants missed scheduled sessions was to attend 
medical, allied health or dental appointments that 
had been arranged prior to study enrolment. Mean 
participant engagement scores across all sessions 
attended was ‘high’ (91%); however, participants were Table 3 Demographics of participants with ID

Knowledge Scale for Use with People with 
an Intellectual Disability (NAKS) question-
naireX While all participants completed this meas-
ure, wide variability in baseline to endpoint 
scores raise questions about instrument 
reliability for our cohort: For example, one 
participant scored 13 at baseline but went 
on to score a significantly lower score of 5 at 
endpoint. Since it is unlikely that participants 
would ‘lose’ this amount of knowledge in a 
12-week time frame it is possible that scores 
reflect guess-work rather than change in 
knowledge
The Personal Wellbeing Index- Intellectual 
Disability (PWI-ID)X While all participants agreed to undertake the 
measure significant differences in pre-testing 
scores from baseline to endpoint raise con-
cerns about instrument validity in our cohort: 
At baseline two participants were unable to 
complete step two of the pre-testing process. 
We were therefore unable to administer the 
measure to them. However, at endpoint, the 
same two participants were able to complete 
the full pre-testing protocol and the 11-point 
scale. The extremely high scores these partici-
pants recorded on the measure at endpoint 
(100 and 92.9 respectively) raise questions 
about the reliability of their responses, 
however. At baseline the remaining four 
participants pre-testing scores indicated that 
they were unable to complete the 11-point 
scale, however, at endpoint they were all 
able to appropriately answer the pre-testing 
questions and thus had the 11-point scale 
administered to them
24 hour food recall X While this form was handed to each partici-
pant and the support worker who attended 
the session with them, no completed or 
partially completed forms were returned 
at baseline or endpoint: Participants were 
unable to independently recall what they had 
eaten at previous meals, and family members 
and carers did not complete the form on 
their behalf
Food photography X Only two participants provided photographic 
data at both the pre-and post-program data 
collection periods. While the two participants 
captured three full days at baseline, neither 
reached the target of a three complete 
photographic records at endpoint (capturing 
1 and 2 days only). One participant declined 
to undertake this task at both time-points 
(reason was not stated). The remaining 
three participants either did not take photos 
despite agreeing to undertake the task, took 
incomplete days of records or took photos in 
which they had blocked the camera lens with 
their hand or clothes

significantly more engaged in the physical activity ses -
sions compared to the nutrition sessions (respective 
mean engagement scores of 99% versus 77%).
Outcome measure feasibility
Table  4 summarises the feasibility of all outcome meas -
ures according to whether they were.
 (i) Reliably administered to all participants at both 
baseline and endpoint, or.
 (ii) Either unable to be administered or administered 
but returned incomplete or unreliable data sets.
For all outcome measures where problems with data 
reliability or completeness were noted, specific issues of 
concern are listed. No adverse events were experienced 
by any participants.
Clinical outcomes
Anthropometric measures
Table  5 lists the groups’ mean baseline and endpoint 
anthropometric data. There was a decrease in the groups 
mean waist circumference (WC) from baseline to end -
point (95% CI: − 3.20, − 0.17  cm). Individually, one par -
ticipant gained 0.5  cm in WC during the intervention, while all five other participants displayed reductions in 
WC (− 0.4  cm; − 2.2  cm; − 2.4  cm; − 3.4  cm; − 2.2  cm). 
There was no clinically significant change in the groups 
mean weight (95% CI: − 1.6, 1.9) or BMI (95% CI: − 0.80, 
0.90) from intervention baseline to endpoint, with three 
participants displaying a non-significant increase in BMI 
post intervention, and three participants displaying a 
non-significant decrease.
Cardiovascular fitness (CV fitness)
Table  6 lists the groups mean CV data at baseline and 
endpoint. The mean number of minutes participants 
were able to undertake the activity increased from base -
line to endpoint (95% CI: 2.44, 7.73). Similarly, the mean 
number of stages participants were able to perform 
increased from baseline to endpoint (95% CI: 1.16, 3.24 
stages). The peak workload participants were able to 
achieve also increased from baseline to endpoint  (95% 
CI: 49.17, 64.98). While none of the six participants 
were able to complete the full protocol at baseline, 
three participants were able to complete the protocol 
at endpoint. There were numerical improvements for 
mean YMCA Peak HR and APMHR from baseline to 
endpoint.Table 4 (continued)
OUTCOME
MEASUREMeasure completed reliably and 
fully at both time pointsIncomplete data returned or problems 
with measure validity notedIdentified problems with administration 
and or validity of measure
Accelerometer data X One participant (baseline) and two partici-
pants (endpoint) did not meet the minimum 
wear time of at least six hours on three out 
of the five wear days that was stipulated in 
our protocol. One participant who had a 
co-occurring diagnosis of autism, struggled 
with wearing the device due to sensory 
issues (stated he dislikes the feel of the device 
around his waist)
IPAQ-proxy X While this form was handed to each partici-
pant and the support worker who attended 
the session with them, only two of the forms 
were returned at baseline or endpoint, 
and these were insufficiently completed to 
provide meaningful data
Physical Strength: 10RM strength testing X We were unable to reliably establish partici-
pants’ rate of perceived exertion in the pre-
testing phase of the protocol and thus were 
unable to administer this outcome measure. 
Inability to establish perceived rate of exer -
tion was related to difficulties participants 
experienced using even a modified scale 
to rate their level of exertion. For example, 
participants, both in cases where the weight 
used was extremely light and in cases where 
the weight used was so heavy the partici-
pants could not attempt the task, reported 
the exercise as “easy” . Without this baseline 
measurement, all participants commenced 
the program on the lowest weight available 
and the decision to increase weight was 
based on technique alone and experienced

Physical strength
All physical strength parameters showed numeri -
cal improvements across the intervention The mean 
improvement in the Sit To Stand (STS) exercise of 2.93 
(95% CI: − 0.18, 7.00) from baseline to endpoint is prom -
ising, given that an improvement of STS =  > 2 reps may 
be clinically significant [36] particularly in relation to falls 
risk Table 7.
Structured aerobic exercise conducted 
throughout intervention
Cycling duration—session 1 started at 9.0 (± 2.0) min 
(n = 4) increased to 13.4 (± 1.4) min by session 24 (48.9% 
increase) (n = 6). Similarly, this is reflected by the dis -
tance cycled during each session—session 1 started at 
2.7(± 1.3) km (n = 4), which increased to 5.6 (± 1.1) km 
by session 24 (107.4% increase) (n = 6).
Accelerometer data
Five participants (baseline) and four participants (end -
point) had sufficient accelerometer wear-time to meet 
the threshold for data analysis set in our protocol. Their 
results are summarised in Table 8 and Fig. 1.Total MVPA across the week (pre) —105.35 ± 47.11 min 
(n = 5) vs. post-intervention 133.48 ± 73.21  min (n = 4).
Those meeting the PA guidelines (150  min of moderate 
PA) pre: 1, increased to 2 post-intervention.
Food intake
Only two participants (E and A) completed the food pho -
tography task to a sufficient extent to allow for a prelimi -
nary analysis to be undertaken. Key nutrition baseline 
and endpoint data for these participants are summarised 
in Table  9. Both participants decreased their total fat and 
saturated fat intake from baseline to endpoint. Who -
legrain intake improved at endpoint; however, results 
for refined grain intake were mixed. While participant 
E’s HEIFA score increased from baseline to endpoint, 
indicating better overall diet quality, Participant A’s 
score decreased over the same period. Overall, average 
daily energy was lower for both participants at endpoint, 
along with most macronutrient and many micronutri -
ents. It is unclear if these patterns reflect real changes in 
diet quality or the fact that both participants recorded 
fewer complete days of data at endpoint compared with 
baseline.
Health literacy
Results from this trial showed no difference in mean 
NAKS scores from baseline (15.17) to Endpoint (13.17). 
Two of the participants recorded higher scores at end -
point while the remaining three participants recorded 
lower scores at endpoint. As identified in Table  3, there 
were concerns about the reliability of these data. All six 
participants completed the NAKS questionnaire pre- and 
post-intervention (n = 6).Table 5 Anthropometric means (± SD) at intervention baseline

Quality of life
Only three of the six participants passed the baseline pre-
testing phase for the PWI-ID measure. Matched pre-post 
intervention data for these three participants shows no 
significant change in mean quality of life scores (baseline 
mean 88.2 vs. endpoint mean of 83.3). One of the three 
participants showed an increased score at endpoint, 
while the other two recorded decreased scores. As identi -
fied in Table  3, there were concerns about the reliability 
of these data.
Participant experience
All participants with ID, along with the two carer partici -
pants, participated in exit interviews. Qualitative feed -
back, including programme highlights and suggestions 
for improvement, were elicited, and thematically ana -
lysed. Core themes emerging from the exit interviews are 
summarised below.
Programme benefits
Participants highlighted several beneficial impacts from 
being involved in the Get Healthy! programme, includ -
ing a sense of pride and achievement; improved knowl -
edge of and commitment to healthy lifestyle change; 
increased opportunities for positive social interactions; 
and improved ability to set future healthy lifestyle goals. 
Table  10 provides contextualised data illustrating these 
positive impacts.Programme problems and challenges
Participants with ID did not identify many areas 
for programme improvement, despite being explic -
itly asked. One participant stated finding that using 
the bike, “made me tired” , and another participant 
described struggling with motivation to get out of bed 
and attend the programme: “Maybe getting out of bed 
[to come, was hard]. I wanted to stay snuggly and warm 
and I didn’t want to get out of a warm bed” (participant 
F). Carer participants, however, identified several areas 
for programme improvement. These are summarised in 
Table 11.
Discussion
Results from the Get Healthy! feasibility pilot indicate 
that the programme was well received by a small group 
of adult participants with moderate ID and their carers. 
The programme has potential to positively impact several 
indicators of cardiometabolic health.
Reflections on programme feasibility
Screening: Only participants screened by GPs as safe to 
participate were included in the trial, however, GPs were 
not required to provide programme facilitators with 
details of each participant’s specific health conditions. 
Unfortunately, not all participants and/or carers in this 
feasibility trial were able to reliably self-report relevant 
medical conditions. For the planned efficacy trial we 
therefore recommend replacing the generic medical con -
sent form, which only asks if any restrictions should be 
placed on the person’s participation, with a more detailed 
form prompting the GP’s to indicate whether or not the 
person has a known diagnosis of: high blood pressure, 
diabetes, asthma, allergies, cardiac complications, lipid 
abnormalities, musculoskeletal conditions, or psychiat -
ric or behavioural issues that may impact on programme 
participation. GPs should also be requested to provide an 
up-to-date list of all medications the person is currently 
prescribed. Knowledge of these conditions can support 
programme facilitators to better manage risk and tailor 
the programme more effectively to each participant’s 
needs.Table 6 Cardiovascular fitness-means (± SD) at intervention

Increasing programme engagement
While overall programme attendance rates were accept -
able and mean engagement scores were high, participants 
were notably less engaged in the nutrition component 
of the programme, compared to the physical activity 
sessions. Qualitative feedback from the exit interviews 
suggests that decreasing didactic teaching content and 
increasing practical activities related to food choice and 
preparation may increase engagement in nutrition ses -
sions for the efficacy trial. An additional issue detracting 
from programme feasibility was limited carer involve -
ment. Only two carers regularly attended the programme 
with participants, and no clear channels of communica -
tion were established between programme facilitators 
and carers who did not attend. Prior research has high -
lighted that carer buy-in can significantly improve the 
extent to which people with ID engage in and sustain 
healthy lifestyle behaviours [37–39]. Developing supple -
mentary on-line or other written teaching content that 
carers can engage with remotely and developing a sched -
ule of home-visits by programme facilitators, may help to 
build closer relationships with carers during the efficacy 
trial.
Improving data collection
Problems arose with the completeness and/or reliability 
of data from several of the outcome measures used in the 
feasibility pilot. A number of factors are likely to have 
contributed to this issue: Firstly, several of the measures 
(i.e. 24-h food recall, food photography, accelerometers, 
IPAQ-pr) required considerable carer support to com -
plete. Retrospectively it is clear that the pilot protocol 
did not include a sufficiently robust carer training and 
follow-up schedule to ensure that full data sets were col -
lected. The carer handouts and instructions sheets, for 
example, were not necessarily passed on from the par -
ticipants with ID to their home carers and Get Healthy! 
programme facilitators did not have access to home carer 
contact information.
Since food photography [40–42], use of accelerometers 
[43, 44] and the IPAQ-proxy [26] have all been shown in 
previous studies to be reliable and viable to implement in 
adult populations with ID, we recommend keeping these 
measures in the protocol for the efficacy trial. However, 
the protocol should be modified to allow programme 
facilitators to liaise directly with carers to provide them 
with task training. A schedule of telephone prompts and 
face-to-face support should also be implemented during 
data collection periods.
Secondly, it is possible that several of the trial out -
come measures, specifically, NAKS, PWI-ID and 10RM 
strength testing, were too complex and therefore inap -
propriate for our study participants, whom had a more ‘moderate’ spectrum of ID. The planned 10RM physical 
strength testing, for example, was unable to be imple -
mented due to cognitive difficulties participants experi -
enced using even a simplified rate of perceived exertion 
scale. Despite our AEP using clinical judgement to deter -
mine endpoint of 10RM testing (e.g. facial grimacing, 
perceived exertion, and technique safety), we believe that 
the values obtained do not represent individual’s true 
10RM. To increase trial efficacy, we recommend replac -
ing this measure with an objective assessment with sim -
plified protocol measures (and reduced risk), such as a 
hand-grip strength test for upper body strength. Func -
tional testing parameters, inclusive of normative data 
validated within this population remains limited, with 
future research looking to widen appropriate assessment 
selection.
Similarly, the NAKS measure may have been too com -
plex for several participants in this study. While the 
NAKS has been validated in populations with mild ID 
[35], it requires participants to be able to meaningfully 
choose from four options. We recommend that a pre-
testing protocol be implemented in the efficacy trial to 
assess whether participants are capable of meaningfully 
choosing from four options. Another issue of concern 
that arose with administrations of the NAKS was pres -
ence of carers, who in some cases attempted to ‘prompt’ 
participants with correct answers. For the planned effi -
cacy trial, we recommend administering the NAKS 
without a carer present wherever possible. Should the 
participant wish to have a carer present in a support 
capacity, we recommend providing additional guidance 
to the carer to refrain from prompting the participant’s 
answers.
In the PWI-ID validation study [45], which included 
adults with mild and moderate ID, all participants were 
able to be administered at least the most basic (2-point 
scale) index. However, in our pilot, baseline pre-testing

Programme highlight Quotes from participants with intellectual disability Quotes from carer participants
Programme fostered a sense of pride and achievement “When I was riding the bikes [the instructor] would say, 
‘come on, keep on going, keep on going’ . I thought that 
was good because it made me feel like I was losing 
weight...pushing that bit more.” Participant F
“I liked them [reward stickers] …That means I went on the 
bike with a high score… [so I was motivated] I did more” . 
Participant E“I just really really like the whole [program] environment. I 
mean, [the instructor] was just amazing with the guys. She 
was always extremely positive. All the guys wanted to go 
each there because of her. … she was so calm and confi-
dent, that she was able to transmit that energy to the guys 
and then when they were there they wanted to be part of 
the activity, they wanted to be part of the exercise.” Carer 2
““[Their] confidence grew with the [bike] equipment. In the 
beginning they were really hesitant and just did two min-
utes, then towards the end they were competing against 
each other- you know, pushing buttons themselves, and 
setting things up and all that sort of stuff. So the equipment 
confidence grew, they jumped in.” Carer 2
Programme Increased knowledge of and commitment to 
healthy lifestyles:Healthy eating “I liked learning about how much sugar was in the coca 
cola… “[I eat] better now [post-program]- at home, eat 
salad” Participant D
“[I liked] learning about different foods, and what you can 
have and can’t have. I thought it [the program] was very 
good because it helped me out a lot.” Participant F
“Well I [still] love eating food and sometimes I love ice-
cream. But only one. Not every day” . Participant A
“I eat a small amount now…a small one [plate of pasta] 
and vegetables and that…I started on the program, drink -
ing it [water]…[and now I] eat fruit. Its really healthy- eat 
bananas and that and eat grapes” Participant E“The guys used to come back and talk a lot about the 
healthy eating choices, and what they spoke about in the 
education sessions. And I know that they liked going out to 
different restaurants or shopping centres and participating 
in a healthy choice option. And there were a few of them 
that, you know, on days where they had brought their own 
morning tea or lunch in from home, you could see that they 
had made that healthy, conscious choice about buying the 
right things.” Carer 2
Physical activity “[I exercise more now because] It’s healthy for your heart” 
Participant D
Yeah, walk- park- everyday [now]” …Exercise is very 
good. Very good idea. Makes sense. I loved it so much” . 
Participant A
“I think exercising does you good because if you’re not 
exercising then you’re watching TV and I think you’ve got 
to get out, get away from it and go for a walk” Participant F“A few of the guys [in the program], their doctors had 
actually reported improvements and were asking what was 
going on. One participant who was in the group, his respira-
tory doctor, said his lung capacity was, he couldn’t believe 
the change that had happened. Because you know that test 
where you blow into the thing and the balls go up- he said 
it was like a different person from when he did it the last 
time, to when he happened to do it just towards the end of 
the program.” Carer 2
The programme provided valued opportunities for social interaction “[I liked exercising] with my friends… I liked the people 
that taught me how to do it [exercise] Participant F”
“[I liked spending time with] the staff’ Participant E“I think they enjoyed mixing with the university staff and the 
other different physiotherapists … they developed a bit of 
a friendship with a few people there. And also some of the 
other, some of the others participants- patients- some of the 
other older people coming in, they enjoyed having a chat 
with them every week as well” Carer 1
“They all had fun [doing the program together], they were 
always- because I used to drive them [to the program] on 
the Tuesdays- they were lined up at my car ready to jump 
in to go every week. I was never having to chase anyone or 
find out where they were.” Carer 2

The programme helped participants to identify future healthy lifestyle goals “I do need help, because sometimes I’ve got problems 
with what I eat…I think I have to cut back on sweets. I eat 
too much from the top [of the food pyramid]…. [I’m going 
to] give up sugar, it’s not good. Too many Coca Colas not 
good” Participant A
“I want to change, so I get back to the size that I was 
before, instead of all of this weight, a healthier weight, 
maybe get help staying away from fatty foods” Participant 
F“[one participant] you made such a positive change in her 
life that now when we are discussing her future goals, one 
of her goals is that she says she wants to do a cooking pro -
gram. And the reason she wants to do a cooking program 
is because she wants to learn how to eat healthy…So I just 
want to point out that the program has really made a posi-
tive change in someone’s life.” Carer 1

identified participants who were unable to be adminis -
tered even this 2-point scale. This finding suggests sev -
eral of our participants may have had a greater degree 
of intellectual impairment compared to the validation 
study cohort. The other issue of concern we experienced 
with the PWI-ID involved participants passing the pre-
testing phase but then scoring at the top of the response 
range across all seven domains. Such a scoring pattern is 
most likely the result of acquiescent responding, a known 
issue among populations with ID [46]. The original vali -
dation study for this measure [45] also encountered this 
issue with data from 32% of respondents needing to be 
removed prior to analysis due to suspected acquiescent responding. We recommend excluding suspected acqui -
escent response data from analysis in the efficacy trial. 
Participants who fail the baseline pre-testing proto -
col should not have the measure re-administered at 
endpoint.
Reflections on potential programme efficacy
Efficacy data from the trial are exploratory in nature, 
given the small sample size, and multiple missing data-
points. Preliminary findings, however, indicate that com -
pared to baseline, most participants in the ‘Get Healthy!’ 
programme recorded clinically meaningful reductions in 
waist circumference and some improvement in measures Table 11 Programme problems and challenges: qualitative participant feedback
Programme challenge Quotes from carer participants
The programme was inadequately resourced:
While the costs of the programme sessions were covered by the research 
team, transport to and from the sessions as well re-imbursement for carer 
time, was not covered. These out-of-pocket costs created financial stress 
for the participating organisation“There wasn’t any additional resources or, um, I don’t know, supports we 
had available to us for the program. Like it was, time that I had to put aside 
out of my week and the other carer had to do the same, and we had, you 
know, to stop other clients using the vehicle so that we could use the 
vehicle on a Thursday [to get to the program]. So it was a bit of a challenge 
because we had clients from all different parts of [the disability organiza-
tion]…like on the days we couldn’t get a vehicle, the taxi to get us all there 
ended up being, like $120 bucks, just in a taxi to do a turn around there and 
back” Carer 2
Communication between programme facilitators and formal and informal 
carers was inadequate“I did get a copy of handouts [from the program] because I would request 
it, but in other cases the guys were getting a copy of the handouts but I’m 
not sure if the support worker or the homes they were living were getting 
a copy as well. So you don’t know if the guys are taking the paper then 
they don’t want it anymore and then they trash it… the group homes or 
the families where they are living need to told, even if its on an email so 
the group homes or families have access to the same information because 
some guys are very particular about their things being touched.” Carer 1
Issues with malfunctioning physical activity equipment created stress for 
some participants“Towards the end of the program the straps on the exercise bike on the 
seat broke, and, um, because they weren’t working for a few weeks, it just 
was a little bit difficult for some of our clients to say, use the exercise bikes 
without the straps because they’d got used to them.” Carer 2
Healthy eating component of the programme was too theoretical “For the nutrition [sessions]….I think it would have been more beneficial 
for the guys to learn in practical ways about food… I think that the talking 
was good, but I just know from experience that they need practice…. so 
perhaps teaching them to make a healthy lunch would have been a bit 
better than to just talk about it… Because I know that they learn by seeing, 
by doing, by touching” Carer 1
Lifestyle changes may not be sustained once programme is over:
While carers highlighted a number of benefits resulting from programme 
participation, they expressed concern that changes may be unsustainable 
without further buy-in from family members and paid support staff“If they [participants with ID] don’t have a constant support, or a program in 
place with someone, or a group of people will be taking them every week 
to continue these [healthy lifestyle] approaches, …it just won’t happen. 
They won’t independently go and do it. Either they need the assistance to 
travel somewhere, or they need someone’s guidance to help them use the 
equipment in the gym, and …they need someone there to give them that 
push” . Carer 2
So I think that it’s got to be a real commitment, not just from the practition-
ers perspective but also from the families perspective, because without 
their support they can’t really do it alone. The ones that did [make healthy 
lifestyle changes] had extra support, whether that was in a group home or 
it was at home. So, yeah, it’s got to be a group agreement, it’s not just the 
participant. Because if the participant wants to lose weight, they want to 
do exercise but they live in a group home unless the carer takes them out 
they wont be able to do exercise. Its compromising, it’s finding a comprise, 
within the organisations where they are living. And keeping them account -
able as well, do you know what I mean?” Carer 1

of cardiovascular fitness. Some participants also dis -
played clinically meaningful improvements in physical 
strength at programme endpoint. BMI, quality of life, 
and objectively measured health literacy did not appear 
to improve from baseline to endpoint. Dietary intake pat -
terns were mixed and analysis was limited due to incom -
plete data.
The decreases in waist circumference recorded for 
all but one participant is a promising finding, given 
that waist circumference provides a relatively sim -
ple and accurate reflection of central adiposity [47, 48]. 
Decreased central adiposity, in turn, is a strong predictor 
of lower risk for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipi -
demia, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease 
[49, 50]. Reassuringly, given the lack of weight loss among 
study participants, this finding holds true irrespective of 
changes to BMI [50].
Study participants displayed some improvements in 
cardiovascular fitness from baseline to endpoint based 
on the YMCA sub-maximal testing protocol. Our par -
ticipants significantly increased their clinical cardiovas -
cular fitness throughout this intervention. Participants 
not only increased (178%) their duration of cycling (2.81 
vs. 7.80  min) but also their workload (70.83 vs. 120  W) 
by 69% post-intervention, while maintaining a steady HR 
(70–65% APMHR). This indicates that participants were 
able to exercise longer at an increased workload, using 
the same amount of energy, indicating increased car -
diovascular fitness. This is supported by the number of 
participants able to complete the YMCA sub-maximal 
testing protocol post-intervention (3 participants vs 0 
participants pre-intervention). Based on post-interven -
tion data, the average estimated  VO2 was 2.14  L/min 
(31.51 ml/kg/min) indicating ‘poor’ cardiovascular fitness 
[51]. Poor cardiovascular ability to sustain prolonged 
physical work is a powerful predictor of morbidity and 
all-cause mortality as well as cardiovascular specific mor -
tality [52, 53]. Improvements in measures of cardiovascu -
lar fitness, if confirmed in a sufficiently powered efficacy 
trial, would thus be another strong argument to imple -
ment the programme more widely among this at-risk 
population. Given that no participants were able to com -
plete this incremental YMCA protocol pre-intervention, 
in addition to the poor cardiovascular fitness measured, 
we suggest fellow researchers consider the inclusion of a 
steady-state cardiovascular cycling protocol, such as the 
Astrand Rhyming Test, or modification to the YMCA 
step test to further increase data collection and efficacy.
Improvements in measures of physical strength were 
also noted for some participants from baseline to pro -
gramme endpoint. Again, this result, if replicated in a 
sufficiently powered efficacy trial, would be promis -
ing in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction. Improved physical strength has been shown to have an attenuat -
ing effect on premature all-cause mortality [54], as well 
as lifestyle-related disease such as diabetes [55], stroke 
[56] and obesity [54]. Our physical strength data high -
lights poor upper and lower body strength for adults 
with ID. Of particular note, is lower limb endurance and 
falls risk, indicative through the 30-sec STS data. Despite 
our cohort having a mean age of 46, this 30-sec STS data 
indicates increased falls risk for adults aged 60–64 years. 
Despite our intervention showing clinically meaningful 
improvements (12.40 pre- vs. 15.33 post-intervention) 
in this outcome measure, post-intervention data contin -
ued to represent increased falls risk for an age bracket 
14–18  years their senior, highlighting the need for con -
tinued exercise interventions and health supports in this 
population.
A point of further discussion includes the relatively 
large age range of the study participants (28–62 years of 
age). Despite concerted efforts of the research team to 
recruit people with ID 40 + years of age, due to the nature 
of the disability service providers who expressed interest 
in this study, we received a large age range of eligible par -
ticipants. We must highlight the variances in physiologi -
cal adaptations based on the ageing process, particularly 
on the ability to build muscular strength and improve car -
diovascular fitness as a limitation of this study. This large 
age range could be a contributing factor in the diversity 
of change seen across our physical outcome measures. 
Further efficacy studies should look to either narrow the 
demographic age bracket of participants, or perhaps tar -
get the exercise intervention dependent on age.
Conclusion
The ‘Get Healthy!’ feasibility pilot was well attended 
and positively received by participants and carers. Out -
come data, while exploratory in nature, suggests the 
programme has potential to improve several important 
indicators of cardiometabolic health including waist cir -
cumference, cardiovascular fitness and physical strength. 
Problems with missing data-points and potentially unre -
liable data were identified, however, and several of the 
study outcome measures will require modification or 
replacement prior to implementing a full-scale efficacy 
trial. Further attention should also be given to improving 
carer buy-in to maximise data collection and programme 
impact and sustainability.
