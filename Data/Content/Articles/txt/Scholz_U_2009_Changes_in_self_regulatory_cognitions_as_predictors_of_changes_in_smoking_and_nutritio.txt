Most longitudinal, correlational studies on health-behaviour change examine
effects of Time1 social-cognitive predictors on subsequent behaviour. In contrast,
our research focusses on associations between changes in predictors with change
in behaviour. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) distinguishesbetween motivational predictors for intention formation and volitional predictors
for behavioural change and served as theoretical basis. Two online-studies were
launched targeting different behaviours (low-fat diet, smoking), different samples(Study 1: N¼469; Study 2: N¼441) and different time spans (Study 1: 3 months,
Study 2: 4 weeks). Data were analysed by means of structural equation modelling
with latent difference scores. Both studies resulted in almost parallel prediction
patterns. Change in risk awareness and change in outcome expectancies did notresult in change in intentions, whereas change in self-efficacy was of crucialimportance. Change in behaviour was associated with change in action planning
and action control over and above the effects of intentions. In one study,
increases in self-efficacy yielded increases in behaviour change. Resultsdemonstrate that change in action planning and especially action control was
of great importance for behaviour change across two different behaviours.
Analysing change in social-cognitive predictors allows drawing precise conclu-sions for interventions.

Introduction
Together with physical inactivity, both poor diet and smoking contribute almost equally to
the largest number of deaths in the USA (Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, & Geberding, 2004,2005). Poor dietary habits can lead to overweight and obesity for which prevalence ratesare increasing worldwide (World Health Organisation, 2006). Overweight is mainly caused
by an energy imbalance over a longer time period. As fat is the nutrient with the highest
amount of calories per gram, eating a low-fat diet is seen as one of the means to reduce

energy intake effectively (e.g. Schweizerische Gesellschaft fu ¨r Erna ¨hrung, 2007). Success
rates of changing one’s diet, however, are rather disillusioning: Most people who initially
change their diet and lose weight have difficulties maintaining their healthier behaviour
over a longer period of time (e.g. Ayyad & Andersen, 2000).
Smoking is an important risk factor for a variety of lethal diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc. In 2006, almost one-third (29%) of Swiss adultsbetween 14 and 65 years of age smoked regularly (Keller, Krebs, Radtke, & Hornung,
2007). More than half (53%) of the regular smokers report intentions to quit smoking and
of those, 41% report having had at least one unsuccessful quit attempt (Keller, Willi,Krebs, & Hornung, 2004). Thus, investigating possible determinants of changing these riskbehaviours is of high relevance and was one aim of the present research.
The widely used social-cognitive theories such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour
(TPB; Ajzen, 1991) and Protection Motivation Theory (Maddux & Rogers, 1983)
commonly specify behavioural intentions as the proximal, and thus most important,predictor of behaviour. Unfortunately, intentions alone do not suffice for successfullychanging one’s behaviour. Empirical evidence for the gap between intentions and
behaviour is given by several meta-analyses (e.g. Webb & Sheeran, 2006). These studies
indicate that intentions leave a large amount of variance unexplained in behaviour orbehaviour change. This is insufficient not only from a scientific view but also from apractical view that aims at effectively supporting people to change their unhealthy habits.
Including additional predictors for behaviour should help to better understand the process
of behavioural change and enable effective interventions for fostering behaviour change.
For the present research, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA; Schwarzer,
1992) served as the theoretical background model as it specifies several predictors forbehaviour change besides behavioural intentions, which is in contrast to prevailing
theories (such as the TPB, Ajzen, 1991). The HAPA differentiates between two phases in
the process of behaviour change: a motivational phase that includes formation ofbehavioural intentions and a volitional phase, which starts right after an intention hasbeen set and which includes the translation of this intention into behaviour.
In the HAPA, predictors of behavioural intentions are risk awareness, positive and
negative outcome expectancies, and self-efficacy. Risk awareness is defined as the
perceived personal vulnerability to a health threat. Perception of one’s own risk is oftenthe starting point of the formation process for health behaviour intentions (Weinstein,2003), as it can bring people to deliberating health behaviour change. However, risk
awareness alone is usually not a powerful predictor of intentions let alone health
behaviour change (Ruiter, Abraham, & Kok, 2001). A second factor for explainingintention formation in the motivational phase is outcome expectancies. It is assumed
that the higher the perceived advantages (i.e. positive outcome expectancies) of a health
behaviour change and the lower the perceived disadvantages (i.e. negative outcomeexpectancies), the more likely people are to build an intention to change theirbehaviour. The third predictor of intentions specified in the HAPA is self-efficacy,
which is defined as a person’s perceived capability to master arising demands and tasks
successfully (Bandura, 1997). Someone who lacks confidence in being able toimplement certain behaviour is less likely to form a behavioural intention. Whereasthe other variables are assumed to unfold their effects on one of these criteria only
(cf Lippke, Ziegelmann, & Schwarzer, 2004), self-efficacy is assumed to be crucial for
both intention formation and change in behaviour. This is in line with assumptions ofBandura’s Social-Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1997). For example, after having formed546 U. Scholz et al.
an intention, a self-efficacious person might initiate and maintain behaviour change
with less difficulty than a person low in self-efficacy.
With formation of a positive intention, a person enters the volitional phase to act upon
this intention. In the HAPA, action planning and action control are seen as crucial for
behaviour change. ‘Action planning’ or implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999)
stand for forming concrete plans about when, where, and how to implement the intendedbehaviour. Many studies investigating the effects of action planning on differentbehaviours could demonstrate its usefulness for behaviour and behaviour change(Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). Planning is generally understood as a means to simulatebehaviour mentally and prospectively, in order to be prepared for situations in which the
behaviour should be performed (Ward & Morris, 2005).
Another volitional construct that has been shown to be a powerful predictor of
health behaviour change is ‘action control’ (e.g. Sniehotta, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2005).Action control is based on the idea from cybernetic self-regulation models (Carver &Scheier, 1998) and comprises three sub-facets: awareness of standards, self-monitoringand self-regulatory effort. Awareness of own standards means that an individual is
constantly aware about what their intentions were in terms of behaviour change (e.g. to
eat a low-fat diet instead of junk food). Without the awareness of own standards,self-regulation failure becomes more likely (Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994).Self-monitoring refers to the process of monitoring one’s own behaviour in order to
evaluate whether further regulatory effort is necessary to reduce possible discrepanciesbetween one’s actions and intentions (having not eaten a low-fat diet the whole week).
If self-monitoring capacity is lowered, for example, in stressful situations, self
regulation failures may result (Baumeister et al., 1994). Finally, if discrepanciesbetween one’s own actions and intentions are perceived, self-regulatory effort must be
invested by applying discrepancy-reducing means. These three facets of action controlcan either be considered separately or combined in a second-order factor. Theimportance of action control in prediction of health behaviour has been confirmed in
longitudinal correlation studies (e.g. Sniehotta et al., 2005) and randomised controlled
trials (e.g. Schu ¨z, Sniehotta, & Schwarzer, 2007).
Change in motivational and volitional variables
Most studies in the area of health behaviour change apply a two-wave research design that
comprises social-cognitive predictors, and measures of behaviour at baseline and follow-up.In these studies, baseline levels of social-cognitive predictors are tested for their ability topredict behaviour at Time 2 either with or without controlling for behaviour at baseline.
Even though findings from such investigations are important from a theoretical
perspective, their results are often interpreted as evidence for eliciting social-cognitivevariables that need to be changed by interventions in order to foster behaviour change.
Such an interpretation may be forejudged because this conclusion is drawn without
observing whether change in social-cognitive variables themselves is indeed associated with
change in behaviour. Moreover, it is no logical necessity that in the case where baselinemeasures predict subsequent behaviour, there are also associations between changes in
social-cognitive variables and change in behaviour. Thus, testing this implication within
a correlational design would require investigating whether actual change in motivational
and volitional variables indeed leads to or at least covaries with changes in intentions andwith change in behaviour.Psychology and Health 547
Aims and hypotheses
The aim of our research was two-fold: First, to test whether changes in motivational and
volitional variables as specified in the HAPA emerge as predictors of change in intentions
and change in behaviour, respectively. Testing the associations between change in social-
cognitive variables and change in behaviour is crucial for identifying the importantvariables to be targeted in interventions. And second, to test the application of the HAPAto two behaviours (low-fat diet and smoking) that have not yet been investigated underthis theoretical framework.
We expected that the prediction pattern formulated in the HAPA model holds for the
level of change scores for both types of behaviour. In particular, hypotheses for bothstudies were the following:
(1) Change in risk awareness, outcome expectancies and self-efficacy predict change in
behavioural intentions.
(2) Change in behaviour is predicted by change in self-efficacy and intentions.(3) Over and above the effects of changes in intentions and self-efficacy, changes in
action planning and action control contribute substantially to change in behaviour.
Data analyses in Studies 1 and 2
One of the major problems with the use of observed difference scores is their typical low
reliability (Plewis, 1985). In order to avoid such problems, we specified latent difference
scores. That is, we investigated associations on the level of ‘true’ differences by specifyingchanges in a latent variable framework. Investigating change in psychological constructsrequires invariant measurement procedures across time points. It needs to be ensured thatthe observed measures are linked to the underlying constructs they are intended to measurein the same way on every occasion (e.g. Bereiter, 1963). There are different statistical toolsthat might be used to investigate the degree of measurement invariance given.One frequently used approach is confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; Jo ¨reskog, 1969).
CFA is a flexible tool that allows investigating different levels of invariance.
Three levels of invariance can be distinguished (Meredith, 1993) and are especially
important in the present study. First, ‘configurable invariance’ is a requirement for theassumption that the measures represent the same constructs on every occasion.Configurable invariance is said to be given when the same factors emerge at everyoccasion. This situation is indicated by qualitatively invariant patterns of loadings acrossoccasions. Second, ‘weak invariance’ or ‘loading invariance’ is a requirement for theassumption that the latent factors are expressed on the same metric. Weak invariance
implies that the impact of latent factors on observed scores is the same on every occasion.
As a consequence, factor loadings are numerical invariant across occasions. Third, ‘stronginvariance’ is said to be given when the measurement intercepts of observed indicators areinvariant across time in addition to the loading matrices. Strong invariance is aprerequisite to capture change on an absolute level. For the purpose of the presentinvestigation, it is thus important to establish strong measurement invariance.
In our CFA model, we impose no restrictions on the factor correlations. That is, we
freely estimate the latent correlations within and across occasions. In contrast, we assume
that unique scores are uncorrelated within occasions, because the only reliable information
represented by these variables is assumed to be item specific. However, we additionallyintroduce cross-time correlations between the uniquenesses belonging to the same itemacross occasions (see also Jo ¨reskog, 1979).548 U. Scholz et al.
Factor means at the first occasion are specified to be zero and all intercepts are
estimated (although they are constrained to be equal across time points to ensure strong
invariance). The factor means at the second occasion are freely estimated. The means thus
directly represent the mean change in latent constructs across time.
The change model is derived by regressing the Time 2 factors on the Time 1 factors
while constraining the regression weights to values of one and including additional factor
disturbances ( /C1s) with freely estimated means and (co)variances into the model.
/C1s directly represent latent or ‘true’ differences. Specifying differences on the level of
latent factors has the advantage of representing absolute change on the level of error-free
common scores (McArdle, 2001). By doing so, the problem of typically low reliabilities of
difference scores (e.g. Plewis, 1985) is circumvented.
The latent change model provides estimates of variance components of latent
changes. Statistically significant change variances indicate the existence of inter-
individual differences in intra-individual change. Clearly, individual differences inchange constitute prerequisites for the present study. Second, the change model
additionally provides covariance estimates between change factors. These covariances
are the basis for specifying directed effects across change factors in the next step ofmodel modification.
Data in both studies were analysed by means of structural equation modelling using
Mplus 4.1 (Muthe ´n & Muthe ´n, 1998–2006). Model fit was assessed by examining /C31
2, the
comparative fit index (CFI), and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA).
A satisfactory model fit is indicated by high CFI (>0.90), and low RMSEA ( 50.08). The
/C312of the model, however, is a sample-size dependent index. Therefore, it cannot be
considered as a basic criterion for the acceptance or rejection of a model (Kline, 2005).
In most longitudinal studies, the problem of missing data occurs. Complete deletion of
persons with missing values is only appropriate when the missing pattern meets the
assumption of missing completely at random (MCAR; Little & Rubin, 2002). MCAR
means that the dropout is a random subsample of the study sample without any systematic
association between missings and observed values. Missing at random (MAR) is a weaker
assumption than MCAR for missing patterns and means that the probability of missingvalues depends on the observed values. Under MAR, the Full Information Maximum
Likelihood technique (FIML; Arbuckle, 1996), which is an integral part of Mplus, results
in unbiased parameter estimates (Enders & Bandalos, 2001). FIML is a method that uses
all available information of all observed (including incomplete) cases in order to enhance
the validity of parameter estimation. FIML is superior to common methods such as list-wise or pair-wise deletion (Enders & Bandalos, 2001); this is why FIML was chosen for the
present study.
Study 1: Changing nutrition habits to eat a low-fat diet
Design and sample
Data were collected online in the context of the commercial web-based nutrition
programme ‘eBalance’ (www.ebalance.ch). EBalance aims at assisting people with long-term nutrition change by means of an online diet-diary, feedback on weight change over
time, recipe suggestions, and weekly ‘coaching letters’. The online study was advertised on
the eBalance-webpage
1and only active members of the programme were invited and able
to join the study. After giving informed consent online, participants filled out the first
online questionnaire. Three months later, participants were automatically invited by emailPsychology and Health 549
by means of the online questionnaire programme ‘Netquestionnaires’ to complete the
second online questionnaire.
Overall, of 2981 registered (i.e. not necessarily active) participants of the eBalance-
programme, 469 respondents (16% of registered participants) filled out the first
questionnaire2, with 344 (73.3%) completing T2 measures. Of the 469 participants, 384
(81.9%) were women; mean age was 44.25 ( SD¼12.40; range 18–79) and mean body mass
index (BMI) was 27.44 ( SD¼4.83). Most of the participants were married or living in a
domestic partnership ( n¼325; 69.3%), 97 persons (20.7%) were single, 36 (7.7%) were
divorced and 11 persons (2.3%) were widowed. In terms of schooling, 462 persons (98.7%)attended 12 or 13 years of school; 5 persons (1.1%) attended 9 years, and 2 persons (0.4%)did not indicate their years of schooling.
Dropout analyses revealed no differences in sex, BMI or education, nor on most core
variables used in the study between dropouts ( n¼125) and continuers ( n¼344). There was
a mean difference in intentions to eat a low-fat diet ( F(1, 464) ¼5.02, p50.05) and action
control ( F(1, 454) ¼4.98, p50.05), in that dropouts reported lower levels of intentions
(M¼3.23, SD¼0.76) than continuers ( M¼3.39, SD¼0.70) as well as lower levels of
action control ( M¼3.08, SD¼0.66 compared to M¼3.22, SD¼0.59). However, this
systematic dropout on core variables of the study can be accounted for by the FIMLprocedure applied by Mplus, because these variables were considered in the SEM(Wothke, 2000). Due to the FIML procedure, the whole initial sample was used for the
final analyses.
Measures
Time 1 and Time 2 questionnaires were identical except for questions on demographic
variables assessed at Time 1 only. All constructs of the HAPA as well as nutritionbehaviour were assessed at both points in time. If not indicated otherwise, scales are taken
from Sniehotta et al. (2005) and adapted to nutrition. The response format for all scales
was a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( disagree )t o4( agree ). Item examples are
translated from German. Scale means and SDs are displayed in Table 1.
Risk awareness was measured by three items (Cronbach’s /C11at Time 1 ¼0.89, at Time
2¼0.93) assessing situation-outcome expectations, for example: ‘If I keep my lifestyle the
way it is, there is a high likelihood that I will develop severe health problems.’

Negative outcome expectancies regarding behaviour change were assessed with three
items (Cronbach’s /C11at Time 1 ¼0.80; at Time 2 ¼0.86). The stem ‘If I eat a balanced
diet, ...’ was followed by negative consequences, such as ‘ ...then the food is not so tasty.’
or ‘...then I’ll lose some of my quality of life.’
Self-efficacy was assessed by three items (Cronbach’s /C11at Time 1 ¼0.84; at Time
2¼0.88), for example, ‘I am confident that I can adjust to a balanced diet,’ or ‘I am
confident that I can eat a healthy diet most of the time.’
Behavioural intentions were measured by a single item: ‘I intend to eat a low-fat diet
(e.g. low-fat meat, cheese, etc.).’
Action planning was assessed by four items (Cronbach’s /C11at Time 1 ¼0.81; at Time
2¼0.88). The item stem ‘I have made a detailed plan regarding ...’ was followed by the
items (a) ‘ ...how to change my eating habits,’ (b) ‘ ...where to change my eating habits
(e.g. in the cafeteria, at home, etc.),’ (c) ‘ ...when (at what meals) to change my eating
habits,’ and (d) ‘ ...from when on I will change my eating habits.’
Action control consisted of the three sub-scales, self-monitoring, awareness of own
standards, and self-regulatory effort, that were measured with three items each. The threesub-scales were used as indicators of the latent construct action control, as has been done
by Sniehotta et al. (2005). The item stem ‘During the past four weeks ...’ was followed by
items like ‘ ...I closely monitored my eating behaviour’ for self-monitoring; ‘ ...I had my
intentions to change my eating habits often on my mind’ for awareness of own standards,and ‘ ...I tried my best to act in accordance to my intentions’ for self-regulatory effort.
Cronbach’s /C11for self-monitoring at was 0.77 and 0.77 at Time 1 and 2, respectively; 0.74
and 0.68 for awareness of own standards at Time 1 and 2; and for self-regulatory effort0.86 and 0.87 at Time 1 and Time 2.
Self-reported nutrition behaviour was assessed by five items from Schwarzer and Renner
(2000). The response format was a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( disagree )t o4
(agree ). Cronbach’s /C11for Time 1 and for Time 2 was 0.64 and 0.71, respectively. An item
example is: ‘When I eat milk products or drink milk, I choose low-fat products.’
Results
In a first step, we tested whether the assumption of strong invariance holds for this study.
As described in the data analysis section, we tested a model with configurable invariance(Model 1) against a model with invariant factor loadings (Model 2), which was testedagainst a model with invariant factor loadings and invariant intercepts (i.e. strong
invariance; Model 3). For the nested model comparisons, differences between CFI should
be below 0.01 (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002)
3. The delta CFI for testing Model 1 against
Model 2 was /C00.001; delta CFI for testing Model 2 against Model 3 was /C00.004. Thus, the
hypothesis assuming strong factorial invariance was not rejected.
Table 1 displays manifest means and SDs of Time 1 and Time 2 measures as well as
latent difference scores. For most variables, significant changes on the mean level wereobserved; only the mean difference in self-efficacy and in low-fat diet did not reachstatistical significance. However, for purposes of the present study mean trends are not of
relevance. The crucial result refers to variance terms, which were statistically significant for
all latent change factors, indicating the existence of reliable individual differences in intra-individual change. In terms of changes in nutrition behaviour 35.1% of those whoparticipated at Time 2 ( n¼316) reported a slight decrease in eating a low-fat diet, 25% did
not change at all and 39.9% reported an increase in eating a low-fat diet.Psychology and Health 551
In terms of correlations of Time 1 measures with change, neither Time 1 risk awareness
(r¼/C00.07, p¼0.25), nor Time 1 negative outcome expectancies ( r¼/C00.04, p¼0.54), nor
Time 1 self-efficacy ( r¼0.03, p¼0.56) were significantly associated with change in
intentions. Time 1 intentions, in turn, was neither correlated with change in actionplanning ( r¼/C00.05, p¼0.46), nor change in action control ( r¼/C00.02, p¼0.76), nor
change in low-fat diet ( r¼/C00.05, p¼0.57). Time 1 self-efficacy did not display any
correlations with difference scores in action planning ( r¼/C00.04, p¼0.60), action control
(r¼/C00.07, p¼0.28), or low-fat diet ( r¼0.02, p¼0.80). Likewise, Time 1 action planning
did not result in a significant association with difference in nutrition over time ( r¼/C00.15,
p¼0.09), nor did Time 1 action control ( r¼/C00.14, p¼0.11). Thus, overall, Time 1
measures were unrelated to change in intentions and nutrition behaviour. Another pictureemerges when looking at correlations between latent difference scores of these variables(see Table 2 for both studies).
The structural model in Study 1 is displayed in Figure 1 and was specified as follows:
latent difference scores of motivational variables risk awareness, outcome expectancies
and self-efficacy were specified as predictors of the latent difference score of intentions.
Change in intentions as well as change in self-efficacy were both specified as predictingchange in action planning, action control and low-fat diet. Moreover, latent difference
scores of action planning and action control were specified as predictors of change in
low-fat diet. All Time 1 measures were allowed to correlate with each other as well as withall latent difference scores. Latent differences of action planning and action controlwere also allowed to correlate. The model fit was good, with CFI ¼0.95, RMSEA ¼0.036
(90% CI ¼0.032, 0.039), /C31
2(df¼828)¼1323.39.
Change in self-efficacy was the only significant predictor of change in intentions to eat
a low-fat diet ( /C12¼0.19, p¼0.01). Contrary to our hypotheses, neither change in risk
awareness ( /C12¼/C00.04, p¼0.46), nor change in negative outcome expectancies ( /C12¼0.10,
p¼0.13) predicted change in intentions. Overall, only 4% variance in change in intentions
could be explained.
Changes in action planning and action control could be explained by change in
intentions (effect on action planning: /C12¼0.12, p¼0.05; effect on action control: /C12¼0.12,

Change in eating a low-fat diet was predicted by a marginally significant direct
effect of change in intentions ( /C12¼0.15, p¼0.06), and significant effects of change in

on nutritional change, change in intentions resulted only via change in actioncontrol in a marginally significant indirect effect (Sobel: 1.69, p¼0.09), but not via
change in action planning (Sobel: 1.62, p¼0.11). Overall, 34% of variance in change
in behaviour was explained by change in intentions, action planning and action
control.
Study 2: Changing smoking behaviour
Design and sample
An online study was launched in order to investigate associations between change in
HAPA constructs and change in smoking behaviour. The online questionnaire wasaccessible via a webpage of the Department of Psychology of the University of Zurich,Switzerland. Recruitment of participants took place via an emailed invitation toundergraduate students of all departments of the University of Zurich as well as to apanel of smokers of the Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine of the University ofGeneva, Switzerland.
4Moreover, invitation for participating in this study was posted at
different German-language smoking-related web pages. Inclusion criterion was thatparticipants smoked at least 1 cigarette a day. After giving informed consent online,participants filled in the first online questionnaire. Four weeks later, participants wereautomatically invited by email by means of the online questionnaire programme‘Netquestionnaires’ to complete the second online questionnaire.

At Time 1, a total of 441 persons completed the first questionnaire. Thereof, 227
(51.5%) were women. Mean age of participants was 32.09 years ( SD¼11.60; range 13–66
years). In terms of marital status, 216 individuals (49.0%) were single, 186 (42.2%) were
married or living in a domestic partnership, 36 (8.2%) were divorced and 3 (0.7%) werewidowed. Mean length of smoking was 15.14 years ( SD¼11.0) with a mean of 15.8
(SD¼10.32) cigarettes daily.
The second questionnaire was completed by 235 participants (53.3%). Dropout
analyses revealed no differences on most core variables of this study. Only for Time 1, the
number of daily cigarettes smoked resulted in a significant mean difference(F(1, 439) ¼7.34; p50.01) with dropouts smoking more cigarettes daily ( M¼17.2,
SD¼9.8) than continuers ( M¼14.6, SD¼10.6). Another significant difference emerged
for action planning at Time 1 ( F(1, 429) ¼4.44, p50.05), with dropouts reporting lower
levels of action planning ( M¼2.16, SD¼0.85) than continuers ( M¼2.33, SD¼0.84).
However, this systematic dropout on core variables of the study can be accounted for bythe FIML procedure applied by AMOS because these variables were included in the SEM.
Due to the FIML procedure, the whole initial sample was used for the final analyses.
Measures
Time 1 and Time 2 questionnaires were identical except for questions on demographic
variables, assessed at Time 1 only. All constructs of the HAPA as well as smokingbehaviour were assessed at both points of time. If not indicated otherwise, scales are taken
from Sniehotta et al. (2005) and adapted to smoking behaviour. For most scales, response
format was a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( disagree )t o4( agree ). Item examples
are translated from German. All means and SDs are displayed in Table 3.
Risk awareness was measured by three items (Cronbach’s /C11at Time 1 ¼0.89, at Time
2¼0.95) assessing situation-outcome expectations, for example: ‘If I keep my lifestyle the
way it is, there is a high likelihood that I will develop severe health problems.’
Negative outcome expectancies regarding behaviour change were assessed with three
items (Cronbach’s /C11of 0.72 and 0.70 at Time 1 and 2, respectively). The stem ‘If I quit
smoking, ...’ was followed by negative consequences, such as ‘ ...then I will suffer from
abstinence phenomenon’ or ‘ ...then I don’t know how to cope with stress situations.’
Self-efficacy was assessed by three items (Cronbach’s /C11at of 0.69 and 0.75 at Time 1
and 2, respectively), for example, ‘I am confident that I can quit smoking within the next
months.’
Behavioural intentions
were measured by a single item: ‘I intend to quit smoking.’
Action planning was assessed by four items (Cronbach’s /C11of 0.72 and 0.84 at Time 1
and 2, respectively). The item stem ‘I have made a detailed plan regarding ...’ was followed
by the items (a) ‘ ...when not to smoke’, (b) ‘ ...where not to smoke’, (c) ‘ ...how to be able
not to smoke’ and (d) ‘ ...when I will quit smoking.’
Action control consists of the three subscales self-monitoring, awareness of own
standards and self-regulatory effort that were measured with three items each. As in Study 1,
the three subscales were used as manifest indicators of the latent construct action
control as has been done by Sniehotta et al. (2005). The item stem ‘During the past sevendays ...’ was followed by items like ‘ ...I closely monitored how much I smoked’
for self-monitoring; ‘ ...I had my intentions to change my smoking habits often on my mind’
for awareness of own standards; and ‘ ...I tried my best to act in accordance to my
intentions’ for self-regulatory effort. Internal consistencies for the three subscales at both554 U. Scholz et al.
points of measurement were satisfactory: Cronbach’s /C11for self-monitoring was 0.84 and
0.91 at Time 1 and 2, respectively; for awareness of own standards /C11¼0.92 and 0.68 at Time
1 and Time 2; for self-regulatory effort /C11¼0.84 and 0.90 at Time 1 and Time 2.
Smoking was assessed by asking ‘On average, how many cigarettes do you
smoke per day?’
Results
In a first step, we tested whether the assumption of strong invariance holds for Study 2 as
well. As described in the data analysis section, we tested a model with configurableinvariance (Model 1) against a model with invariant factor loadings (Model 2), which was
tested against a model with invariant factor loadings and invariant intercepts (i.e. strong
invariance; Model 3). We again relied on differences in CFI to test for measurementinvariance (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002). The delta CFI for testing Model 1 against Model 2was zero; delta CFI for testing Model 2 against Model 3 was /C00.003. Thus, the hypothesis
on strong factorial invariance was not rejected.
Table 3 displays manifest means and SDs of Time 1 and Time 2 measures as well as
latent difference scores. Here, only the mean difference score in daily smoking reachedstatistical significance. For all latent difference scores, however, significant variances
emerged, indicating reliable inter-individual differences of change in all variables over
time.
At Time 2, individuals smoked on average 1.71 cigarettes less than at baseline
assessment. In terms of changes in smoking behaviour, 40.6% of those who participated at
Time 2 ( n¼217) reduced their number of cigarettes smoked, 20.6% did not change their
number of cigarettes and 17.5% reported a slight increase in their smoking behaviour.
In terms of correlations of Time 1 measures with changed scores, Time 1 risk awareness
was not significantly associated with change in intentions ( r¼0.01, p¼0.99), neither was
Time 1 negative outcome expectancies ( r¼0.12, p¼0.12). In contrast, Time 1 self-efficacy
was significantly correlated with change in intentions ( r¼/C00.25, p¼0.001). Time 1
intentions was neither correlated with change in action planning ( r¼/C00.02, p¼0.83) or
change in action control ( r¼/C00.01, p¼0.91). A significant correlation occurred, however,
between Time 1 intentions and change in smoking behaviour ( r¼/C00.20, p¼0.01).

Time 1 self-efficacy did not display a significant correlation with difference scores in action
planning ( r¼/C00.12, p¼0.18) nor with change in action control ( r¼0.06, p¼0.42). There
was, however, a marginally significant association between Time 1 self-efficacy and changein smoking ( r¼/C00.13, p¼0.08). Likewise, Time 1 action planning was significantly
related to difference score in smoking ( r¼/C00.18, p¼0.02). In contrast, Time 1 action
control was not significantly associated with change in smoking ( r¼/C00.08, p¼0.28). As in
Study 1, correlations between latent difference scores show a quite different picture tocorrelations between Time 1 measures and change in intentions and behaviour (Table 2).
The structural model in Study 2 was identically specified as in Study 1 (Figure 1).
Model fit was good, with CFI ¼0.94, RMSEA ¼0.043 (90% CI ¼0.039, 0.047),
/C31
2(df¼519)¼942.06. Change in self-efficacy was the only significant predictor of
change in intentions to quit smoking ( /C12¼0.36, p50.01). Contrary to our hypotheses,
neither change in risk awareness ( /C12¼0.03, p¼0.71) or change in negative outcome
expectancies ( /C12¼/C00.03, p¼0.85) were significantly associated with change in intentions.
Overall, 13% of variance in change in intentions could be explained.
Changes in volitional factors action planning and action control could be explained by
change in intentions (effect on action planning: /C12¼0.19, p¼0.02; effect on action control:
/C12¼0.19, p50.01), and by changes in self-efficacy (effect on action planning: /C12¼0.43,
p50.001; effect on action control: /C12¼0.37, p50.001). Amount of variance explained in
change in action planning was 28% and in change in action control was 22%.
Change in number of daily cigarettes smoked was predicted by change in action control
(/C12¼/C00.34, p50.001), and change in self-efficacy ( /C12¼/C00.23, p50.05). Neither change in
intentions ( /C12¼0.06, p¼0.45), nor change in action planning ( /C12¼0.11, p¼0.33) were
significantly related to change in smoking. Change in self-efficacy was also marginallyindirectly related to change in smoking via change in action control (Sobel: /C01.78,
p¼0.08). Overall, 16% of variance in change in behaviour was explained.
General discussion
Our research demonstrated the importance of investigating the associations between
change in motivational and volitional constructs and change in intentions and behaviour.
Both studies showed largely the same prediction patterns in that changes in motivationalpredictors were more strongly associated with changes in intentions than baselinemeasures in motivational predictors and that changes in volitional measures (i.e. actionplanning, action control), intentions and self-efficacy were more strongly associated withchange in behaviour than baseline measures of those predictor variables. These similarresults emerged although implemented with different target behaviours (i.e. low-fat dietand smoking cessation), different time spans (3 months and 4 weeks), and differentsamples, emphasising the validity of the chosen approach.
The substantial similarity of results across Study 1 and 2 is not only convincing when
considering the difference between behaviours, but also when considering differencesacross both samples. While Study 1 participants were highly motivated (i.e. meanintentions at Time 1 were 3.35, SD¼0.72 on a scale from 1 to 4), respondents in Study 2
did not report high intentions at Time 1 (
M¼1.67, SD¼0.96 on a scale from 1 to 4). This
also speaks in favour of the validity of the HAPA across samples of different motivationalstarting points.
In both studies change in risk awareness and change in negative outcome
expectancies were not associated with change in intentions. For outcome expectancies,556 U. Scholz et al.
this is in contrast with results of other studies (e.g. Bandura, 1997). Risk awareness,
however, has often been demonstrated to be a weak predictor in studies on the HAPA(e.g. Schwarzer & Renner, 2000).
In line with our assumptions, change in self-efficacy was an important predictor of
change in intentions and of change in behaviour. For the latter, this was qualified by a direct
and several indirect effects via volitional variables and intentions in both studies. Theseresults demonstrate the importance of self-efficacy in the process of health behaviour change(cf Bandura, 1997) and are in line with previous research in health behaviour change(e.g. Kok, deVries, Mudde, & Strecher, 1991; Luszczynska, Tryburcy, & Schwarzer, 2007).
Considering the bivariate correlations between change in intentions and change in
behaviour, both studies demonstrated that change in intentions alone would not have been
able to explain 34% of variance in change in a low-fat diet nor 16% of change in smoking
behaviour. To a certain amount, this might be due to the fact that intentions weremeasured by a single item. However, the finding that intentions alone are not sufficient fora satisfying prediction of behaviour is in line with the literature on the intention-behaviourgap (e.g. Sheeran, 2002) and with other studies on the HAPA that used multiple indicators
for intentions (e.g. Sniehotta et al., 2005). Thus, inclusion of volitional variables proved
once again useful. This is in line with several recent studies on the HAPA (e.g. Schwarzeret al., 2007). The present article, however, is the first to demonstrate associations betweenchanges in motivational and volitional variables with changes in intentions and in
behaviour by using a non-experimental correlational design.
The positive association between change in action planning and change in behaviour in
Study 1 is in line with several studies on the effects of implementation intentions on
nutrition behaviour (e.g. Luszczynska et al., 2007). In Study 2, no significant association
emerged between change in action planning and change in smoking behaviour. This iscontrary to our hypotheses as well as to most results reported in the literature on positiveassociations between action planning and change in different health behaviours (e.g.,Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). In studies on the effects of action planning on smoking
cessation, however, results are equivocal. Higgins and Conner (2003), for example, could
not find any significant difference between an implementation intention group and acontrol group in terms of number of cigarettes smoked. In the present study, planningitems assessed amount of planning notto smoke. Likewise, in the study of Higgins and
Conner (2003), target behaviour was to resist smoking, that is, not to smoke. A possibleexplanation for the lack of effects of implementation intentions on behaviours that need to
be given up is that plans for not doing something might be not comparable to plans for
doing something. Future studies should, therefore, examine this issue more closely.
To our knowledge, this study was also the first to demonstrate the usefulness of change
in action control for change in nutrition and smoking cessation. Change in action controldisplayed the strongest direct effect on change in behaviour in both studies. Its usefulnessin interventions on change in dental flossing has already been demonstrated (e.g. Schu ¨z
et al., 2007). Within the research on smoking cessation, one facet of action control, self-
monitoring, is among the most prominent concepts for smoking cessation (e.g. Fisher,Lichtenstein, Haire-Joshu, & Morgan, 1993). Thus, action control is a promising target forinterventions for changing different health behaviours.
Advantages of measuring change
Most studies that test for associations between Time 1 measures with Time 2 behaviour or
change in behaviour from Time 1 to Time 2 interpret their results as evidence for whatPsychology and Health 557
social-cognitive variables need to be changed by interventions in order to foster behaviour
change. However, as our data demonstrates, prediction patterns of change in motivationaland volitional variables for latent difference scores in intentions and behaviour differedquite substantially from correlations of Time 1 measures with change in intentions andchange in behaviour. Thus, as most interventions are based on the assumption thatchanging social-cognitive variables will lead to change in behaviour, the present approachconstitutes a step forward to the question what variables should indeed be changed in anintervention.
Moreover, testing for associations between change indices instead of testing for
baseline associations with change in criteria may be of particular importance in studyingbehaviours that do not have a clear baseline, as for example, in terms of a starting pointof behavioural change, but covered a rather optional time period during ongoingbehaviour change.
Furthermore, the present results have important methodological implications. Testing
predictor variables only at Time 1 might blur major relations between variables due todifferent response sets persons have (Maydeu-Olivares & Coffman, 2006). For example,when Person A tends to respond positively to all items, whereas Person B tends to respondnegatively to all items, associations between variables could only emerge due to theseresponse sets. When analysing associations between difference scores, however, thesepossible methodological artefacts are accounted for, because by subtraction response setsare likely cancelled down.
Limitations and outlook
The present investigation has its limitations. First, in terms of causality, we can not claim
that change in motivational predictors caused change in intentions, nor that change in
volitional predictors caused change in behaviour. Indeed, it might be as well the other way
round: according to Bandura (1997), for example, mastery experience with certainbehaviour is a source of self-efficacy beliefs. We can conclude however, that change insocial-cognitive variables is accompanied by change in behaviour. Furthermore, as theSEM results demonstrated, these associations were in line with the theoretical expectationsspecified in the HAPA model.
Second, behavioural intentions were measured by using a single item only. Although in
line with other studies that used multiple indicators for intentions (Sniehotta et al., 2005),this might have contributed to the weak prediction of intentions alone for behaviour.In future studies, multiple indicators for intentions should be assessed.
A third limitation of both studies is the use of self-reported behaviour as the main
outcome variable. However, self-reported smoking might be seen as a rather accuratemeasure (e.g. Bernaards, Twisk, van Mechelen, Snel, & Kemper, 2004). For self-reportednutrition, under-reporting of actual behaviour is a known problem in overweight people(Howat et al., 1994). However, online studies have the advantage of higher anonymitycompared to common paper and pencil studies, and as a consequence, are less prone totrigger socially desired responses (e.g. Joinson, 1999).
Fourth, the measurement of the constructs might face some problems with regard to
the correspondence principle (Ajzen, 1991). Some of the predictors in both studies wereassessed at a more general level (e.g. risk awareness) than others (e.g. intentions orbehaviour). This might have influenced the predictive power of these predictor variablesnegatively, as prediction is assumed to be highest when predictor and criterion are558 U. Scholz et al.
measured on the same level of generality/specificity. Future studies might want to solve
this problem by using the same level of specificity for all predictors used in the study in
order to ensure comparability across predictor variables.
This article has several implications for future research. Examining associations with
change in motivational and volitional variables with change in behaviour allows for betterinsight into processes of health behaviour change. This is important for future
interventions and should thus be implemented more often in two-wave studies, especially
in those that do not contain a clear baseline. Based on the results of the present research,interventions should aim at fostering self-efficacy, action planning and action control for
fostering change in nutrition behaviour. For example, action control can be increased by
keeping a diary on one’s daily behaviour. Especially for smoking cessation, action controlmay be of crucial importance (e.g. Fisher et al., 1993). Associations between action
planning and smoking cessation need further investigations. Moreover, in terms of
planning, it should be investigated whether there is a difference in effectiveness forbehaviours that need to be given up (e.g. smoking cessation) and for behaviours that needto be initiated.
