ABSTRACT
Purpose: A healthy diet and consistent physical activity (PA) form
the foundation for effective self-management in adults with type
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Behavioral interventions, which target
diet and PA, can facilitate effective diabetes self-management
practices. Greater clarity regarding the ‘active ingredients ’
incorporated into behavioral interventions is needed to inform the
evidence base about effective intervention techniques to advance
behavioral theories and to improve clinical practice. The use of
intervention mapping (IM) to develop a novel diabetes
intervention to increase consumption of low glycemic index (GI)
foods and to increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA ispresented.
Methods: Determinants from self-regulation and the Health Action
Process Approach theoretical framework formed the foundation of
the intervention. The IM taxonomy of behavior change methods
and strategies from Hope Therapy (e.g. goal maps) were used to
guide techniques for changing selected theoretical determinants
of behavior. A pilot study of the intervention among adults with
T2DM ( n= 12) was conducted using a pre-/post-test design to
evaluate intervention components and participant acceptability.
Results: Participants attended a mean (±SD) of 8 (±1.4) of the 10
weekly 90-minute, group-based sessions. The magnitude of effectwas moderate ( d> 0.50) for the change in behavioral intentions,
action control, and action and coping planning for engaging in PA
and large ( d> 0.80) for the change in action self-efficacy and
action and coping planning for eating low GI foods post-intervention.
Conclusions: Greater emphasis on value-based decision-making,
the goal mapping process, and successively progressive exercise
goals should be included in future versions of the intervention.
Based on pilot testing, a larger randomized controlled trial that
incorporates these intervention modifications is warranted and
the modified intervention has a greater likelihood for success.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to increase in the U.S. popu-
lation in both sexes and in every age and racial/ethnic group (Menke, Casagrande, Geiss, &
Cowie, 2015). Given its prevalence and quality-of-life burden (Zhuo et al., 2014), there is a
great need for better treatment options. Regular physical activity (PA) and consumption of
a healthy diet form the cornerstones of effective diabetes self-management (American Dia-
betes Association, 2017). Including a low glycemic index (GI), low glycemic load dietary
component within the context of a healthy diet may reduce the comorbidities associated
with T2DM (Augustin et al., 2015).
Changing health behaviors, such as diet and PA, is challenging. There is a need to
develop and implement effective health behavior change interventions with well explicatedand testable mechanisms of change. Michie and Johnston ( 2012) recently called for greater
clarity regarding the ‘active ingredients ’(i.e. behavior change techniques) and links
between intervention components and theoretical mechanisms of change. Interventionmapping (IM) provides a framework for linking behavior change techniques to theoreticalmechanisms of change during intervention planning, implementation, and evaluation
(Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, Gottlieb, & Fernandez, 2011).
Comprehensively describing interventions, in combination with evaluative feasibility
and impact studies, will provide the evidence base to design new interventions, advancetheories of behavior change, and ultimately improve practice. For intervention developers,
an intervention is more than the end product; it is a complex process that requires a mul-titude of decisions to be made during development (Brendryen, Kraft, & Schaalma, 2010).
The rationale for each decision represents valuable knowledge for the field and a standar-dized reporting process will aid knowledge creation.
To this end, IM provides a framework for effective decision-making in intervention
development, implementation, and evaluation based on theory, empirical evidence, and
additional research (Bartholomew et al., 2011). IM includes six iterative steps: (1)
conduct a needs assessment; (2) create matrices of change objectives; (3) select theory-
based intervention methods and practical applications; (4) organize methods and appli-
cations into an intervention program; (5) plan for program adoption, implementation,
and sustainability; and (6) generate an evaluation plan. Each step builds on the precedingstep providing intervention designers with a logical process. In the past, interventionists
used IM to develop nutrition, PA, and diabetes prevention interventions (Cullen, Bartho-
lomew, Parcel, & Kok, 1998; Elsman et al., 2014; Gillison et al., 2012; Van Stralen et al.,
2008). However, we know of no other intervention that used the IM framework to
develop an intervention for adults with T2DM. Yet, patients with T2DM report difficulty
adhering to diet and PA self-management behaviors as components of the diabetes self-
management regimen (Ary, Toobert, Wilson, & Glasgow, 1986).
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe the development of the Pathways
Diabetes Intervention and present feasibility results using the IM framework. The goalsof the Pathways intervention were to increase consumption of low GI foods and increasePA based on prior research (Gutschall, Miller, Mitchell, & Lawrence, 2009; Miller,
Gutschall, & Mitchell, 2009; Miller, Headings, Peyrot, & Nagaraja, 2011). Because the
Pathways intervention was informed by prior formative (Davis & Miller, 2006) and inter-
vention research, a separate needs assessment (IM step 1) was not conducted. Instead, we318 C. K. MILLER ET AL.
focused on the development of a novel intervention and IM steps 2 –4 are presented here to
bridge the link between theory and intervention programming. Results from a feasibility
study to evaluate program components and participant acceptability of the interventionalso are reported in preparation for broader program implementation (IM step 5) and effi-cacy/effectiveness evaluation (IM step 6).
Methods
IM step 2: matrix of change objectives
Step 2 involves stating the specific behaviors to change (i.e. program goals), sub-behaviors to
target (i.e. performance objectives) to achieve change, and mechanisms that produce thosebehaviors (i.e. determinants or mediators). An essential tool for IM is the matrix of
change objectives, where the matrix is populated with information that program developers
provide regarding performance and change objectives (Bartholomew et al., 2011). Change
objectives target the mechanisms by which program participants achieve performance objec-
tives and specify what must be learned or changed. Performance objectives state exactly what
program participants need to do (or perform) to accomplish program goals. For example, anincrease in perceived confidence or self-efficacy (SE, determinant) to initiate an action plan
(performance objective) to increase consumption of low GI foods (program goal) aligns a
theoretical determinant with a performance objective and a program goal.
The program goals and performance objectives for the Pathways intervention included
increasing consumption of low GI foods and level of PA. In order to achieve these program
goals, study participants needed to identify their current level of performance of these
behaviors (e.g. consume 1 serving/day of a low GI food) compared to the goal level(consume 4 servings/day) and determine if a discrepancy exists (sample performance
objectives; see column 1 in Table 1 ). The GI goal included substituting low GI foods (a
GI value <56 on a 100-point scale with pure glucose equivalent to 100) for higher GI
foods. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review the concept of GI and its potential
health benefits (for review see Barclay et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2011; Wang, Xia, Zhao,
& Zhang, 2015). Briefly, consumption of carbohydrate-containing foods variably affects
the post-prandial plasma glucose response, and GI classifies foods according to that
response. Glycemic load is GI adjusted for the quantity of food consumed (Augustin
et al., 2015). In our previous research, participation in a behavioral intervention increased
consumption of low GI foods by an average of 1.79 (±0.53 SE) servings (Miller et al., 2011).
In an attempt to increase gains during the intervention phase for the current study, weestablished the program goal of substituting ≥3 servings/day of low GI foods for higher
GI foods beyond the number of low GI servings consumed at one ’s personal baseline.
For example, if the person consumed 3 servings/day on average at baseline, theprogram goal for an individual participant was set at ≥6 low GI servings/day. One
approach to goal achievement is to substitute 1 lower for 1 higher GI food at each of 3
meals (but alternate approaches also are possible, including snack substitutions). Thus,
≥3 substitutions per day seemed realistic and practical as a dietary goal. For PA, the Amer-
ican Diabetes Association recommends adults with T2DM achieve ≥150 minutes/week of
moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (Colberg et al., 2016). Therefore, the Pathways inter-
vention included a dietary and ≥150 minutes/week PA goal as the target behaviors.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 319

Theories of self-regulation provide strategies for developing new habits and served as the
foundation for the identification of performance objectives for the current study. Self-regu-
lation refers to the monitoring and modulation of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to beconsistent with desired ends (Carver & Scheier, 1998; Mann, de Ridder, & Fujita, 2013).
Behavior change in the current environment that many adults with T2DM are confronted
with requires prioritizing health concerns in the face of omnipresent temptation. Self-regu-
lation is thus essential in this context. Following prior research (Gutschall et al., 2009; Miller
et al., 2009,2011), we used the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) to guide interven-
tion development. Critically, the Pathways intervention also incorporated novel insightsand intervention techniques emerging from self-regulation research in health and socialpsychology (Mann et al., 2013; Rand & Cheavens, 2009). A brief overview of HAPA and
self-regulation determinants chosen is described below.
Health Action Process Approach
The HAPA differentiates between motivation to change behavior leading to an intention
to change and actively pursuing behavior change (Schwarzer, 1999,2008). An intention to
act is based on risk perceptions, outcome expectancies, and perceived SE. Risk perceptionassesses the perceived vulnerability for poor health outcomes (e.g. T2DM-related comor-bidity). Although risk awareness is not a powerful determinant of behavior, it can lead to
deliberation about behavior change (Sniehotta, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2005a ). Outcome
expectancies represent beliefs about the positive and negative outcomes of the target
behavior and contribute to forming an intention to change. SE represents belief in one ’s
capability to perform the behavior. In HAPA, action SE operates in concert with positive
outcome expectancies and risk perception to form an intention to act.
Once an intention to act is formed, planning is needed to bridge the gap between an
intention to act and acting on the behavior. However, successful behavior change requiresnot only getting started but also persisting and restarting after setbacks occur until the goal is
attained. SE remains influential after an intention has been formed until the new behaviorbecomes habitual, and HAPA identifies three types of SE beliefs. Action SE refers to one ’s
confidence in being capable of performing a difficult or novel behavior. Coping SE describesoptimistic beliefs about one’ s capability to sustain a behavior regardless of obstacles encoun-
tered. Similarly, recovery SE describes individuals ’conviction to get back on track after an
interruption or being derailed. Individuals with a high degree of recovery SE trust theirability to regain control after a setback or failure. Finally, action control, a separateconcept, facilitates intention initiation and maintenance by becoming aware of the behav-ioral standards one is trying to achieve, self-monitoring behavior during goal striving, and
regulating effort to reduce the discrepancy between behavioral standards and actual behav-
ior (Sniehotta, Nagy, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2006). Action control is hypothesized to be the
most proximal volitional predictor of behavior (Sniehotta et al., 2005a ).
Agency and values in the self-regulation of behavior
Self-regulation is particularly important in the context of self-control dilemmas (i.e. situ-
ations that present immediate rewards yet undermine more valuable, longer-term goals;Ainslie, 1975; Fujita, 2011). HAPA is largely silent about people ’s dynamic shifts in322 C. K. MILLER ET AL.
motivation from situation to situation and how behavior change goals can compete with
alternate goals (Mann et al., 2013). Consider, for example, a participant presented with a
favorite pasta dish. The pasta dish is tempting and activates a hedonic eating goal. This
temptation may in turn weaken the resolve to maintain another goal of eating a healthydiet (Stroebe, van Koningsbruggen, Papies, & Aarts, 2013). Successful behavior change
requires prioritizing healthy eating goals over these competing and short-term hedoniceating goals on a consistent basis.
Self-regulation research acknowledges that multiple goals operate simultaneously and
strategies for maintaining attention to and success toward behavior change goals in theface of competing goals are available. A key strategy is integrating the role of construalin resolving self-control conflicts (Fujita & Carnevale, 2012; Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999).
The term ‘construal ’refers to people ’s subjective understanding of a given event. For
example, construing a piece of cake as a ‘tasty snack ’may lead people to experience stron-
ger impulses to consume the cake. By contrast, construing the same cake as ‘a fattening
indulgence ’should reduce those impulses and motivate restraint. Research suggests that
construals of temptations that focus on their concrete consumatory features promoteself-control failure, whereas construals that focus on more abstract goal- and value-rel-evant features promotes self-control success (Fujita & Carnevale, 2012; Metcalfe &
Mischel, 1999).
Linking goals to broader values can help resolve self-control conflicts. For example,
someone working toward increasing PA, would be encouraged to identify and call to
mind values that would be well-served by progress on this goal (e.g. life unencumbered
by disability and more time with loved ones). Re-construing temptations (e.g. omit exer-cise to watch television) in terms of values actively reminds people why they want to
practice restraint in pursuit of the more valued goal. By linking values to self-control
conflicts, the Pathways intervention incorporated a determinant not explicitly addressedin HAPA.
Beyond improving self-control, values address another key factor in behavior change
(Doi, Yokomitsu, & Sakano, 2016). That is, even if people are certain they can perform
a behavior, they may have no compelling reason to do so. Various factors, such as com-peting priorities, environmental and social pressures, and habitual patterns of behavior,
can waylay even the strongest intention to act. Reminders of one ’s values and use of posi-
tive agentic thinking may influence the attractiveness of behavior change goals and, con-
sequently, the motivation to engage in and continue to strive toward those goals (Eccles &
Wigfield, 2002). Effortful choices are not likely to be made unless one has clearly linked
behavioral choices to agency and goals that are consistent with personal values. The rela-
tive value attached to a goal should influence the likelihood that effort will continue to be
exerted. Positive agentic thinking provides the motivation for overcoming obstacles during
ongoing goal pursuit.
Thus, the Pathways intervention is the first intervention, to our knowledge, grounded
in this integrative theoretical approach that incorporated determinants from HAPA and
self-regulation more broadly. To inform the determinants, we incorporated theoretical
propositions from HAPA and self-regulation, as discussed above. Finally, change objec-tives were generated at the intersection between performance objectives and determinants
(seeTable 1 ). The resulting matrix became the focal point for the integration of theory
with the desired behavior changes.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 323
IM step 3: theory-based methods and practical strategies
IM step 3 involved the selection of theoretical methods and practical strategies for addres-
sing change objectives. Taxonomies of behavior change techniques or methods are general
techniques or processes demonstrated to change one or more theoretical determinant ofbehavior (Kok et al., 2016). Practical strategies or applications are translations of
theory-based methods for practical use specifically designed to meet the needs of thetarget population in the environmental context in which the intervention will be deliveredwith consideration for the delivery method (e.g. face-to-face, internet, telephone). Trans-
lating methods into practical applications required a sufficient understanding of the par-
ameters under which the theoretical process is or is not effective. For example, goal settingcan be an effective method to promote change but requires the goal to be specific, suffi-ciently challenging, and action oriented (Locke & Latham, 1990). The taxonomy of behav-
ior change methods developed by Kok et al. ( 2016) was used for the Pathways intervention
(seeTable 2 ). Basic methods designed for intra-individual change, which may be applied
to almost any determinant, are presented first. Methods designed to change specific deter-
minants follow with the definitions used in the IM taxonomy (Kok et al., 2016). With the
taxonomy, the IM process resulted in a toolbox where methods that appropriately fit
within the intervention context were selected.
Furthermore, methods drawn from Hope Therapy were included in the intervention to
address theoretical drivers of program goals to achieve behavior change according to self-regulation. Hope Therapy was developed as an application building on the theoreticaland empirical literature suggesting that hope is strongly associated with self-regulation, pri-
marily as demonstrated through optimal goal-setting behaviors and goal outcomes (e.g.
Snyder, 1994; Snyder et al., 1996). The therapy is broadly defined as a set of intervention
strategies aimed at improving goal-setting strategies (i.e. setting specific goals with measur-
able endpoints, anticipating goal-relevant obstacles), increasing pathways thinking (i.e. gen-
erating workable routes to important goals) and agency thinking (i.e. generating andmaintaining goal-relevant momentum and motivation) (Cheavens, Feldman, Gum,
Michael, & Snyder, 2006; Feldman & Dreher, 2012; Thornton et al., 2014). An example
of a group activity that is drawn from Hope Therapy is the ‘goal maps ’activity (Cheavens
et al., 2006). In this task, participants graphically depict program goals, their current pos-
ition relative to the program goal, and the various ways (or ‘pathways ’) that could link
current state to the desired goal state. Participants also anticipate and depict obstacles to
goal attainment and actively plan alternate pathways to overcome or bypass these obstacles.
For example, someone with a goal of increasing PA to 150 minutes/week, would describe
her current PA behavior (e.g. walk the dog once/day for 10 minutes) on the goal map. Then,the PA goal (e.g. exercise ≥30 minutes/day 5 days/week), and the various pathways that
would move her from her current behavior to her goal behavior (e.g. walk the dog twice/
day, walk with a co-worker at work for 20 minutes during lunch, and join a 60-minute exer-
cise class at the recreation center on Sundays) would be depicted on the map. The goal mapincludes anticipated obstacles (e.g. co-worker takes a vacation) and ways to overcome each
obstacle (e.g. download interesting podcasts for the lunch walk during those two weeks).
This goal mapping exercise not only allows participants to think about and set appro-
priate goals, but it also helps them plan strategies for goal attainment and provides a visualmetric for tracking goal progress. Completing the goal mapping exercise is a form of324 C. K. MILLER ET AL.

approaches provide social interaction and support that is lacking when interventions
are delivered individually. Content was organized and sequenced into ten 90-minute,
weekly group sessions based on learning principles to avoid presenting too many new con-
cepts at once (Driscoll, 1994) and theoretical principles of incremental skill-building for
mastery. Table 3 provides an overview of the weekly intervention content.
Participants received material and completed activities to assist the skill-building and
self-monitoring process. Each participant received: a written manual, which explainedall topics discussed during each intervention session; logs for self-monitoring GI foodvalues, minutes spent in PA, and pre- and post-prandial glucose values; a book with GI
values to facilitate self-monitoring (Brand-Miller et al., 2014), sample low GI meal
plans at four calorie levels, and low GI recipes. Self-selected SMART goals (i.e. specific,
measurable, attainable, relevant, timely) were established by participants each week to
help meet program goals. Goal specificity was emphasized as participants were asked to
indicate the day, time, and location for performing self-monitoring and recording activi-ties and PA behaviors. Goal maps were created during three of the sessions (see Table 3 ).
Intervention sessions opened with a discussion of participant experiences encountered
in goal striving and self-monitoring during the previous week. New material was then pre-sented, followed by application of the content and behavioral tools through an individual
or small group activity (see Table 2 ). For example, session 2 included measuring portions
of certain foods (e.g. cereal) to gain a better understanding of the quantity of food and
carbohydrate consumed. This activity was designed to increase awareness of food portionsfor self-regulation purposes.
Participants were encouraged to self-monitor dietary changes and PA by recording
everything they ate and drank (and the associated GI values) and minutes spent indaily PA. They also were asked to record pre- and post-prandial glucose values for at
least three meals each week. We suggested that they rotate the meal selected for self-
monitoring (e.g. breakfast on day 1, lunch on day 2, dinner on day 3) to gain abetter understanding of glucose responses following food consumption (and not just
fasting values) and to reduce the burden and cost associated with glucose monitoring.
Intervention sessions for the pilot study were facilitated by a registered dietitian and agraduate student in psychology who were trained in the intervention protocol. Self-monitoring records were reviewed weekly by the dietitian, and individual, written feed-
back was provided.Table 3. Content topics presented during weekly intervention sessions.

Preliminary IM step 5: pilot test of the intervention
Following development of the Pathways intervention, we conducted a small feasibility
study with adults diagnosed with T2DM ≥1 year using a pretest-posttest design. These
individuals participated in the 10-week intervention and completed instruments to
assess perceived disease risk, HAPA determinants, hope, and self-control measures.
Each instrument and subscale are briefly described below, and subscale scores were deter-
mined for evaluation.
High-risk perception, according to HAPA, influences one ’s intention to engage in
behavioral change (Schwarzer, 2008). The Risk Perception Survey-Diabetes Mellitus
assessed perceived risk for diabetes complications and other personal risks, such asother diseases and environmental factors. The survey includes five subscales: (1) personalcontrol over developing diabetes complications; (2) optimistic bias regarding the belief
that one is less likely to develop complications than other people; (3) personal risk regard-
ing perceived risk for nine other diseases (e.g. kidney failure); (4) comparative environ-mental risk which compares the perceived risk of nine potential hazards in the
environment (e.g. pesticides); and (5) degree of worry related to developing diabetes com-
plications. The composite score had adequate internal consistency (Cronbach α= 0.85)
among a diverse sample of people with diabetes previously (Walker et al., 2007).
In addition to one ’s risk perception, outcome expectancies and SE influence one’ s
intention to change behavior, according to HAPA. For PA in the feasibility study, itemsqueried how likely one would be to engage in regular PA within the next month withregular PA defined as being active at least 5 times/week for at least 30 minutes each
time, consistent with the Pathways goal. Both positive and negative outcome expectancies
and SE statements (e.g. How likely is it that you will get regular physical activity within thenext month when you have other demands?) developed for people with diabetes were
administered using a 5-point response format (Plotnikoff, Lippke, Courneya, Birkett, &
Sigal, 2008). Intention regarding likelihood of being regularly physically active within
the next month was assessed with 1-item ranging from 0% to 100% (Plotnikoff, Blanchard,
Hotz, & Rhodes, 2001). Action SE for PA was assessed via a separate instrument using 13
items validated previously among people with diabetes (Plotnikoff et al., 2001,2008).
While outcome expectancies and risk perception influence motivation to set an inten-
tion to act according to HAPA, SE remains influential before and after an intention to act
has been established. Coping (e.g. I am confident that I can be physically active even if it isdifficult for me) and recovery (e.g. I am confident that I can resume my physical activityeven if I was not active for some time) SE items used previously (Parschau et al., 2014;
Schwarzer, Ziegelmann, Luszczynska, & Scholz, 2008) were administered to assess confi-
dence in dealing with obstacles to change. The self-regulatory component of action control(e.g. I can control my physical activity when the weather is bad), action planning, and
coping planning items from previous research also were administered (Parschau et al.,
2014; Schwarzer, Lippke, & Luszczynska, 2011). Response options included a 5-point
format ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
Prior research has not targeted consumption of low GI foods using a HAPA framework.
Thus, HAPA-related determinants were assessed in the feasibility study using itemssimilar to the PA items and other items patterned from prior research (Parschau et al.,
2014; Sniehotta, Schwarzer, Scholz, & Schuz, 2005b ). Outcome expectancies addressed328 C. K. MILLER ET AL.
potentially positive results from eating low GI foods (e.g. If I eat low glycemic index foods,
my blood sugar will improve), and intentions addressed key behaviors targeted during the
intervention (e.g. I intend to prepare some low glycemic index foods at home). A secondinstrument assessed coping and recovery SE, the self-regulatory component of actioncontrol, and action and coping planning for incorporating low GI foods into the diet.
Response options ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree. An instrument devel-
oped and validated previously to assess action SE for eating low GI foods also was admi-nistered (Miller, Gutschall, & Lawrence, 2007).
The State Hope Scale was administered to assess pathways (i.e. perceived ability to gen-
erate routes to goals) and agentic (i.e. the perceived ability to generate mental energy tosuccessfully achieve goals) thinking in a given moment, indicating one ’s current goal-
directed thinking (Snyder et al., 1996). Three items assess pathways thinking and three
items assess agentic thinking for achieving goals with response options ranging from 1=‘definitely false ’to 8 = ‘definitely true; ’higher scores represent more hopeful thinking.
Previous research found the instrument possesses construct, convergent, and discriminantvalidity and high internal consistency (Snyder et al., 1996).
Self-control (i.e. the ability to prioritize larger-later over smaller-immediate rewards)
also was assessed (Ainslie, 1975; Fujita, 2011; Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriquez, 1989). The
brief Self-Control Scale is a self-report trait measure with adequate internal consistencyand test-retest reliability; it has been used to predict a broad range of positive outcomes(e.g. less binge eating, better interpersonal skills, more optimal emotional responses) pre-
viously (Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone, 2004). Response options range from 1 = ‘very
much like me ’to 5 = ‘not at all like me. ’The scale was administered as an exploratory
measure to determine the impact of a brief intervention on self-control as a means of alter-ing self-control success or failure.
Consistent with the IM process, a pilot test of the intervention was conducted to help
refine the intervention and study procedures for a larger trial (Leon, Davis, & Kraemer,
2011). Specifically, we wanted to assess the acceptability, sequence, and flow of session
topics and activities, assess the usability of study instruments, and determine participantsatisfaction with intervention delivery and duration. Instruments were self-administeredpre- and post-intervention for participants to complete at home at their convenience.
Twelve participants (10 female) completed the pilot feasibility study (mean (±SD) age
53.9 (±8.7) years with a median duration of T2DM of 6.5 years). The study was approvedby the Institutional Review Board at the sponsoring university, and participants provided
written informed consent.
Results
Participants attended a mean (±SD) of 8 (±1.4) sessions. Table 4 provides baseline scores
for each determinant, the change in score from pre- to post-intervention, and effect size
estimations. Because this was a feasibility test of the intervention, the study was notpowered for hypothesis testing or to detect significant change in outcomes. In general, par-
ticipant scores were mid-range of scale scores at baseline, indicating a floor or ceiling effect
did not occur, and scores improved following the intervention. Action and coping plan-ning, in particular, improved, consistent with the emphasis on setting specific goals, iden-tifying potential obstacles to goals, and strategies for minimizing obstacles duringHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 329
intervention sessions. The magnitude of effect was moderate ( d= 0.50) to large ( d= 0.80)
for intentions, action planning, and coping planning (Cohen, 1988). Of note, agentic
thinking improved more than pathways thinking on the State Hope Scale; scores obtained
from the brief Self-Control Scale also improved.
IM steps 5 and 6: full-scale program implementation and evaluation
Overall, the Pathways intervention was well accepted by pilot study participants based on
session attendance, engagement during session activities, and feedback both during and
following group sessions. IM provides a standardized method for intervention develop-ment and reporting, and the process facilitated grounding the Pathways intervention in
self-regulation theories. Preliminary findings from the feasibility study showed that assess-
ment questionnaires were appropriate and the intervention may facilitate improvement inself-regulation determinants of change.
More emphasis on pathways thinking, however, is needed during the intervention in
future trials based on subscale change scores from the Hope State Scale. Three sessions(seeTable 3 ) included the use of goal maps to specifically identify pathways to goal attain-
ment, obstacles, and ‘routes ’around these obstacles. Participants were unfamiliar with theTable 4. Baseline scores and change scores for the behavioral determinants of change in the Pathways

goal mapping process and more time should be devoted to this practice during the interven-
tion for greater skill-building; this modification will be incorporated into future versions of
the Pathways intervention. In addition, study interventionists recommended introducingthe concepts of self-talk (week 5) and values (week 9) earlier during the intervention andmore consistently (not just 1 session) throughout the intervention. The intervention will
be modified to introduce positive self-talk and core values earlier, move some of the GI
information later, and return to value-driven decision-making consistently throughoutthe intervention. A more consistent focus on values also may improve self-control by
emphasizing long-term goals over the immediate here-and-now.
Finally, some participants felt the PA goal of 150 minutes/week was too ambitious at
baseline and they needed to initiate PA more slowly. While we discussed starting with10 minutes of PA if that was necessary, some people needed reassurance that setting pro-
gressive goals was acceptable.
Discussion
This paper describes the development of a novel behavioral intervention that addresseskey components of diabetes self-management, consuming a healthy diet and engagingin regular PA. The Pathways intervention was grounded in determinants of self-regu-
lation and the HAPA theoretical framework. Using this framework, a person develops
an intention to change a behavior and the intention is translated into action using a per-formance plan. Once an action has been initiated, however, it has to be maintained.Newly adopted behaviors are not achieved through a single act of will; they involve
self-regulatory skills and strategies, which were incorporated into the Pathways interven-
tion. Experience from the Pathways feasibility study supported the IM framework as alogical, comprehensive, theory-based approach to intervention development and evalu-
ation. Findings from the feasibility study demonstrate that the Pathways intervention
facilitated greater intention to make dietary and PA change and improvement in hope,planning, and SE, particularly SE for eating a lower GI diet. Future versions of the inter-
vention should place greater emphasis on value-based decision-making, the goal
mapping process, and gradual but progressive increase in PA for participants who aresedentary at study enrollment.
Planning and SE are targeted in HAPA to improve behavioral outcomes, and behavioral
outcomes may improve clinical outcomes such as weight control and glycemia. Prior longi-tudinal survey research found that the HAPA framework explained fruit and vegetableintake and PA (Schwarzer et al., 2007). In these studies, planning and recovery SE were
proximal predictors of behavior, and planning served as a mediator between intentionand behavior. These initial studies provide support that planning and SE are key determi-nants of diet- and PA-related behaviors. While the current feasibility study was not designed
to conduct mediation analyses, action and coping planning for both diet and PA increased
substantially, consistent with the focus on planning in the Pathways intervention. In theGreater Green Triangle Diabetes Prevention Project, a HAPA-based intervention con-
ducted through primary care clinics resulted in significant improvement in weight, blood
glucose, and lipid levels, indicating a 23% reduction in T2DM risk (Laatikainen et al.,2007). Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of the Pathways intervention on
these outcomes, which are key markers of optimal diabetes management.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 331
The impact of the Pathways intervention on behavioral outcomes, such as diet and
PA should be determined. Prior research among adults with T2DM following a low-
intensity self-guided intervention based on HAPA found significant improvements inhealthy eating for both the intervention and control groups (MacPhail, Mullan,Sharpe, MacCann, & Todd, 2014 ). Improvement in both treatment groups may rep-
resent a measurement effect whereby participants report behavior change simply bybeing asked (Morwitz & Fitzsimons, 2004 ). Thus, more interventions, such as the
Pathways intervention, are needed in adults with T2DM to determine whether and
how well interventions based on self-regulatory models facilitate the adoption and
maintenance of health-related behaviors. The reported study is one step in thisendeavor.
Given that this initial study was a feasibility study, the efficacy of the Pathways inter-
vention was not a study goal. Pilot studies are recommended to evaluate the feasibilityof study procedures and treatments provided and to assess acceptability (Lancaster,
Dodd, & Williamson, 2004). Future research is needed to fully implement the interven-
tion among a sample of adequate size to formally evaluate the impact of the interven-
tion on theoretical determinants of change, consumption of low GI foods, and level ofPA compared to an appropriate control condition. Multiple dietary recalls or food
records are needed to fully evaluate the impact of the intervention on the target behav-
ior of dietary GI and servings consumed. Accelerometry can be used to assess interven-tion impact on intensity and duration of PA, the second target behavior. The Pathways
intervention primarily focused on individual determinants of change; however, social
and environmental determinants also influence diet- and PA-related behaviors(McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988). While the intervention was delivered in
a group format to foster social support, a greater emphasis on developing social net-works to support lifestyle change may be needed. A supermarket session was incorpor-ated to help participants apply behavioral strategies during grocery shopping. However,we did not specifically target environmental determinants of change. While
better addressing social and environmental determinants of change may improve inter-
vention efficacy, a longer intervention duration and greater resources would likely beneeded.
Conclusion
In summary, the Pathways intervention is well grounded in theories of self-regulation andpotentially effective mechanisms of behavior change (Michie, Whittington, Abraham,McAteer, & Gupta, 2009). These mechanisms are described, consistent with calls for
greater clarity regarding intervention development (Michie & Abraham, 2004). Based
on current pilot testing, a larger randomized control trial that incorporates appropriateintervention modifications is warranted and this modified intervention has a greater prob-ability for success.
