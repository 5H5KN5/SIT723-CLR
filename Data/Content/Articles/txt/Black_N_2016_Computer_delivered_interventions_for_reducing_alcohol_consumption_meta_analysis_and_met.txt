The current aim was to examine the effectiveness of behaviour change
techniques (BCTs), theory and other characteristics in increasing the
effectiveness of computer-delivered interventions (CDIs) to reduce
alcohol consumption. Included were randomised studies with a primaryaim of reducing alcohol consumption, which compared self-directed
CDIs to assessment-only control groups. CDIs were coded for the use of
42 BCTs from an alcohol-speci ﬁc taxonomy, the use of theory according
to a theory coding scheme and general characteristics such as length of
the CDI. Effectiveness of CDIs was assessed using random-effects meta-
analysis and the association between the moderators and effect size was
assessed using univariate and multivariate meta-regression. Ninety-three
CDIs were included in at least one analysis and produced small,signi ﬁcant effects on ﬁve outcomes ( d
+= 0.07 –0.15). Larger effects
occurred with some personal contact, provision of normativeinformation or feedback on performance, prompting commitment or
goal review, the social norms approach and in samples with more
women. Smaller effects occurred when information on theconsequences of alcohol consumption was provided. These ﬁndings can
be used to inform both intervention- and theory-development.Intervention developers should focus on, including speci ﬁc, effective
techniques, rather than many techniques or more-elaborate approaches.ARTICLE HISTORY

Excessive alcohol consumption can cause signi ﬁcant negative health consequences, such as cardio-
vascular disease, some cancers, liver cirrhosis and injuries, as well as ﬁnancial costs associated with
lost productivity, health-care and law-enforcement (Rehm et al., 2009 ). In recent decades, there
appears to have been a dramatic increase in the interest in computer-delivered interventions
(CDIs) for reducing alcohol consumption. CDIs are those interventions in which a participant interacts
with technology (e.g., desktop/laptop computers, smart phones or tablets), rather than with a thera-
pist, to receive the intervention content. Further, this content is relatively automated in that a thera-pist is not required to deliver or modify content for each individual participant. If effective, CDIs might
offer an accessible, cost-effective and appealing means of reducing alcohol consumption (for a
review, see Vernon, 2010 ).
Current knowledge
When evaluating interventions, at least three questions must be considered: do they work ,how well
do they work and how do they work? (Michie & Abraham, 2004 ). Regarding the ﬁrst two questions,

existing meta-analyses suggest that, amongst both college students (Carey, Scott-Sheldon, Elliott,
Bolles, & Carey, 2009 ; Carey, Scott-Sheldon, Elliott, Garey, & Carey, 2012 ) and the wider population
(Rooke, Thorsteinsson, Karpin, Copeland, & Allsop, 2010 ), CDIs have some small, positive effects on
a range of drinking outcomes. A medium effect has also been found amongst adults with problemdrinking (Riper et al., 2011 ); although, the authors note that the high motivation of this self-referred
sample could explain this larger effect. However, the third question remains unanswered and it is
imperative that the intervention components that are associated with the greatest behaviour
change are identi ﬁed.
Existing meta-analyses have identi ﬁed some moderators that are associated with larger CDI effects
on alcohol consumption. Regarding sample characteristics, CDIs appear to be more effective amongstsamples which include more heavy drinkers (Carey et al., 2012 ) and fewer students (Carey et al., 2009 ).
There are mixed results regarding gender; one study suggests that CDIs are more effective amongst
samples with more men (Carey et al., 2012 ), whereas others suggest no gender differences (Carey
et al., 2009 ; Rooke et al., 2010 ). Regarding CDI components, poorer outcomes have been associated
with the provision of feedback on alcohol-related problems (Carey et al., 2009 ), identifying high-risk
situations, and including decisional-balance or values-clari ﬁcation exercises (Carey et al., 2012 ).
Finally, there are also mixed results regarding length of the CDI; whilst Riper et al. ( 2011 ) found
that single-session, personalised-normative-feedback CDIs were less effective than extended self-help CDIs, Carey et al. ( 2012 ) found that length of the CDI in general was not associated with effec-
tiveness. As such, it is still unclear whether it is the CDI content or the length that drives effectiveness.
Questions remaining
Whilst existing meta-analyses have identi ﬁed some characteristics that are associated with CDI effects
on alcohol consumption, typically investigation of such moderators has been a secondary aim. As
such, a more systematic approach to this question is essential and timely. Systematic approachesto classifying intervention components include consideration of behaviour change techniques
(BCTs) and of the theoretical basis employed.
A BCT is a ‘speci ﬁc, irreducible component of an intervention designed to change behaviour and a
putative active ingredient in an intervention ’(Michie et al., 2012 , p. 1432). A number of BCT taxo-
nomies have been developed, including one speci ﬁcally targeting excessive alcohol consumption
(Michie et al., 2012 ). At the level of individual reports, these taxonomies support the detailed and
reproducible description of intervention content. At the meta-analytic level, coding of interventionsby BCTs allows the presence or absence of these techniques to be included in a meta-regression to
identify the effective components of CDIs. This knowledge can then be used in the future develop-ment and re ﬁnement of interventions.
Theoretical basis refers to the extent that theory was used to inform interventions and can be
reliably quanti ﬁed using Michie and Prestwich ’s(2010 ) theory coding scheme. A large number of the-
ories have been identi ﬁed (Davis, Campbell, Hildon, Hobbs, & Michie, 2015 ) and these theories
describe the mechanisms by which behaviours are thought to occur. As such, interventions thattarget the constructs identi ﬁed by theories should be more effective in changing behaviour, and
interventions that involve more-extensive use of effective theories should be more effective than
those that involve less-extensive use. In practice, reviews have generated mixed results. Across
health behaviours broadly, meta-regressions have demonstrated both positive associations (Webb,Joseph, Yardley, & Michie, 2010 ) and no association (Prestwich, Sniehotta, et al., 2014 ) between
the degree of theoretical basis and intervention outcomes. It might be that where no associationwas found, this was due to the use of ineffective speci ﬁc theories. Indeed, the most-commonly
used theories in Prestwich, Sniehotta, et al. ’s(2014 ) review, social cognitive theory and the trans-
theoretical model, were not associated with improved outcomes. Further, these theories are less-commonly applied to the prediction of alcohol consumption than are other theories such as thetheory of planned behaviour (Cooke, Dahdah, Norman, & French, 2014 ) and prototype willingness342 N. BLACK ET AL.
model (van Lettow, de Vries, Burdorf, & van Empelen, 2014 ; Todd, Kothe, Mullan, & Monds, 2016 ). Thus
identifying those theories that are effective in reducing alcohol consumption is an essential step
towards optimising interventions.
Current aim and original contribution
The aim of this review is to identify the general study characteristics, BCTs and theories that areassociated with CDI effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption. This review extends upon pre-
vious reviews in the following ways: First, it involves the systematic search for the individual com-
ponents that impact behaviour change, by applying a full, alcohol-speci ﬁc BCT taxonomy (Michie
et al., 2012 ). Previous reviews were initiated before the publication of this taxonomy, and hence,
were unable to take such an approach to answering this question. Second, it investigates the roleof speci ﬁc theories and the extent of theory use, using a theory coding scheme (Michie & Prestwich,
2010 ). No meta-analysis has utilised this method to examine the impact of theory on the effectiveness
of CDIs for alcohol consumption.
Third, it utilises an improved statistical approach. When identifying moderators of CDI effective-
ness, it is important to examine the relationship between multiple important moderators simul-
taneously. Such an approach allows for the identi ﬁcation of the moderators with the strongest
effects (i.e., those that remain when controlling for other moderators) on alcohol consumption.
Only one review of CDIs for alcohol consumption has used such a multivariate approach (Carey
et al., 2012 ). Indeed, whilst Carey et al. ( 2012 ) identi ﬁed a number of CDI components and sample
characteristics associated with effectiveness, only the proportion of women remained signi ﬁcant
when simultaneously testing all identi ﬁed moderators. This difference highlights the importance of
taking a multivariate approach.
Method
The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Liberati et al., 2009 ) checklist
for this review is provided in Supplemental Table 1.
Selection of studies
Computerised searches of PsycINFO (1806-present), Medline (1950-present), Global Health (1910 –
present) and Web of Science Core Collection (1900-present) were conducted in October 2015.
Search terms for alcohol consumption (e.g., alcohol consumption, binge drink*)1were combined
with technology (e.g., internet, computer*, phone application) and intervention (e.g., intervention*,treatment) terms. Results were limited to English-language papers and studies with humans. Fullsearch terms are presented in Supplemental Table 2.
As seen in Figure 1 , 3062 records were identi ﬁed and 261 full-text records were assessed for eli-
gibility. Studies were excluded if they did not involve random allocation to at least one CDI andcontrol group. Relevant CDIs were those that: (1) primarily targeted reduction or prevention of
alcohol consumption, (2) were delivered by computers, mobile phones, the internet or other
similar digital media, (3) could be completed with minimal involvement from experimenters or thera-pists (i.e., the experimenter or therapist did not direct the participant through the intervention or
deliver the intervention content), (4) were individual-patient level (i.e., were not mass-media cam-
paigns or provider-directed CDIs) and (5) were non-pharmacological. Relevant control groups werethose that involved either (1) alcohol-assessment-only or (2) alcohol-assessment plus intervention
for unrelated health behaviour. Studies were also excluded if (1) alcohol consumption was not
reported, (2) the CDI required specialised medical equipment or (3) participants had a mentalillness or impairment. This search process resulted in 93 CDIs included in at least one analysis.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 343
Coding of moderators
Studies were coded for the following sample and study characteristics: age (mean), gender (%
women), university sample (1 = yes, 0 = no), mandated participants (1 = mandated, 0 = not man-
dated), heavy drinker status (% of sample reported as heavy drinkers, as de ﬁned by the original
authors), location (by country). The following CDI characteristics were also coded: personal contact
(1 = some, 0 = none), length (1 = >30 min, 0 = ≤30 min), number of sessions (1 = >1 sessions, 0 = 1
Figure 1. Identi ﬁcation and selection process for studies included in the meta-analyses and meta-regressions.344 N. BLACK ET AL.
session) and length of follow-up (1 = >1 month, 0 = ≤1 month). Such groupings allow comparison
between brief and extended CDIs and between immediate and long-lasting effects.
BCTs were coded using Michie et al. ’s(2012 ) 42-item taxonomy of techniques to reduce excessive
alcohol consumption. For half ( k= 47) of the CDIs, the CDI itself, the CDI-mapping paper, the study
protocol or other resources that provided detailed CDI descriptions were freely available online. In
these instances, both these and the manuscript/s were accessed to code the use of BCTs. Both the
intervention and control group procedures were coded along all 42 items (1 = present, 0 = absent).
For each item, the control score was subtracted from the intervention score for use in the moderatoranalyses. As such, techniques that were present in both groups would not be considered to affect
effect size.
If a theory or theories were used to develop the intervention, then this theory was recorded to test
whether use of speci ﬁc theories (each coded 1) was associated with larger CDI effects than use of no
theory (coded 0). Secondly, the extent of theoretical basis was coded according to the presence of
each of the ﬁrst 11 items (1 = yes, 0 = no, for each item) of Michie and Prestwich ’s(2010 ) theory
coding scheme (with slight modi ﬁcations to items 8 and 11 as per Webb et al. ( 2010 )). The ﬁrst 11
refer to intervention development and participant selection, which are factors that could in ﬂuence
intervention effects. The 11 items were summed to compute an overall use-of-theory score. Wherea theory was used, then this use-of-theory score was used to determine whether more-extensive
use of that theory improved CDI outcomes.
All coding was conducted by the ﬁrst author and 20 (21.5%) of the CDIs and corresponding control
groups were independently second-coded for BCTs and theory. Gwet ’s(2001 ) AC1 statistic was used
to indicate inter-rater reliability. AC1 is more reliable than Cohen ’sκunder high trait prevalence
(Wongpakaran, Wongpakaran, Wedding, & Gwet, 2013 ), which was the case here. AC1 was initially
high (BCTs: 0.92; theory: 0.77), indicating substantial to near-perfect agreement, and was improved
following double-checking of discrepant items (BCTs: 1.00; theory: 0.94). Perfect agreement was
easily achieved through discussion of remaining discrepancies. The coding of the other 73 CDIswas then checked and updated by the ﬁrst author, for consistency with the decisions agreed upon
by both coders.
Calculation of effect sizes
Dependent variables were grouped into ﬁve categories to examine differential CDI effects on differ-
ent drinking behaviours: (1) total consumption : total quantity per extended period of time (e.g., per
week), (2) average consumption : average quantity per drinking occasion or drinking day, (3) peak con-
sumption : the maximum quantity of alcohol consumed on one occasion, (4) heavy episodic drinking
(HED) frequency: frequency of heavy episodic drinking (or ‘binge ’drinking) and (5) frequency : fre-
quency of any alcohol consumption. Where a study reported multiple outcomes within a category,these were averaged into a single effect size for that category.
The primary effect-size estimate was the standardised mean difference (Cohen ’sd) with Hedges ’g
adjustment. Positive effect sizes indicate better outcomes for the CDI group than for the controlgroup. Where possible, effect sizes were computed whilst controlling for baseline differences.
Where multiple time points were reported, the longest follow-up was used. Where studies included
multiple, different, relevant CDIs, all CDIs were included separately and the sample size of the controlgroup was reduced, to control for multiple comparisons. If the CDIs within a study differed only on
characteristics not of interest (e.g., gender-speci ﬁc vs. gender-neutral feedback), these were com-
bined into a single CDI. Where data were presented separately for different groups within a paper
(e.g., women and men), these were combined into a single group. Where there were insuf ﬁcient
data to calculate effect sizes, study authors were contacted and the data requested.
2Effect sizes
were interpreted using Cohen ’s(1992 ) guidelines of d= 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 indicating small, medium
and large effects, respectively.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 345
Outlier detection
Two methods were used for identifying outlier effect sizes. First, z-scores of the effect sizes were cal-
culated to identify extreme values at the α= .001 level (i.e., | z| > 3.30). Second, the sample-adjusted
meta-analytic deviancy statistic (SAMD) was calculated for each study. The magnitude of the
SAMD indicates the degree of deviance of the study effect size, relative to that expected by
chance (whilst considering sample size and average effect size; Huffcutt & Arthur, 1995 ). The absolute
values of the SAMDs were inspected via scree plot and those values rising above the ﬂat portion were
ﬂagged. Only studies identi ﬁed by both methods were considered outliers, to minimise the chance of
erroneous exclusion of studies.
Inspection of z-scores was conducted to identify outliers on the continuous moderators. Where
outliers were detected, the univariate meta-regressions were conducted both with and withoutthe outlier value. Results were compared to ensure that outliers were not producing spuriously
large effects. Analyses conducted without the outlier value/s were considered to be the main ana-lyses, to reduce the possibility of Type I errors induced by one or two outliers.
Meta-analytic strategy
Analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3 (Borenstein, Hedges,Higgins, & Rothstein, 2014 ). Meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted separately for
each of the ﬁve dependent variables. Random-effects models were chosen to incorporate the
assumption that studies were likely to differ in complex ways uncaptured by the examined modera-tors (Cooper & Hedges, 1994 ). The possibility of publication bias was assessed using Begg and
Mazumdar ’s(1994 ) rank correlation test and, when signiﬁ cant, Duval and Tweedie ’s(2000 ) trim-
and-ﬁll was used to adjust the effect sizes. To assess the presence and degree of heterogeneity,
theQand I
2statistics were used. I2indicates the proportion of between-study variance attributable
to heterogeneity, where 25%, 50% and 75% are considered low, moderate and high values, respect-
ively (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003 ).
For each dependent variable, univariate meta-regressions were conducted to examine the effect
of individual moderators on CDI effectiveness. Moderators were tested only when they contained asufﬁcient range of values (for categorical moderators this meant they were present and absent in at
least four studies). Within each univariate meta-regression, the strength of association between the
moderator and effect size was assessed as the coef ﬁcient, β, and the proportion of heterogeneity
accounted for by the moderator was assessed using the adjusted R
2.
Within each dependent variable, multivariate meta-regressions were conducted using all moderators
that demonstrated meaningful (| β| > 0.10) and/or statistically signi ﬁcant ( p< .05) associations with effect
sizes in the univariate analyses. This approach allowed the identi ﬁcation of those moderators most
strongly associated with CDI effectiveness, whilst controlling for other important moderators. Uponrunning these analyses, those moderators that no longer demonstrated meaningful or signiﬁ cant associ-
ations were removed to create the ﬁnal models. Where there were missing values for a moderator, the
analyses were conducted both with and without this moderator, to examine any differences thatoccurred as a result of the reduced power. Where multi-collinearity between moderators was present,
analyses were conducted separately by correlate d moderators to eliminate this problem. Subgroup
meta-analyses were conducted within moderators that were signi ﬁcant in the multivariate analyses.
Results
Outlier detection
One study was identi ﬁed as an outlier on both tests. This study (Schinke, Schwinn, Noia, & Cole, 2004 )
reported large effects on both HED ( d= 2.31, z= 5.60, SAMD = 18.49) and drinking frequency ( d=346 N. BLACK ET AL.
2.49, z= 4.60, SAMD = 19.76) and was inspected for features that might have contributed to the
effects (as per Huffcutt & Arthur, 1995 ). This study was unique in terms of its long follow-up (7
years cf. 2 years for the next longest), young participants ( M= 11 years at baseline cf. the next young-
estM= 14 years) and relatively infrequent baseline alcohol consumption ( M= 0.5 occasions in past 30
days). For these reasons, the study was deemed suf ﬁciently divergent from the other studies and was
removed so that the sample of included studies would be more representative of the true population
of interest.
Four studies had outlier values on the moderator age. Speci ﬁcally, one study reported signiﬁ cantly
higher age of participants for each of the datasets of total consumption (Hansen et al., 2012 ), peak
consumption (Hester & Delaney, 1997 ), HED frequency (Montag et al., 2015 ) and drinking frequency
(Hester & Delaney, 1997 ). Results for the corresponding univariate meta-regressions are presented
both with and without these outliers.
Description of studies, samples and CDIs
Studies were published between August 1997 and July 2015. Most of the 93 CDIs were conducted in
the USA ( k= 55), were brief ( ≤30 min; k= 66), contained a single session ( k= 67), involved no personal
contact ( k= 69) and were conducted with university students ( k= 70) and those who were not man-
dated to complete the CDI ( k= 88). Median age of samples was 20 years and median proportion of
women was 55%.
All CDI and control groups received BCT31 (assess drinking), due to the required nature of the
study designs included. Excluding BCT31, the CDIs utilised a median of six BCTs (range: 1 –22).
Used by more than 75% of CDIs, the most-commonly used techniques were BCT5 (provide feedbackon performance; k= 79), BCT4 (provide normative information; k= 75) and BCT1 (provide information
on consequences; k= 75). Seven techniques were never used (BCTs 6, 13, 25, 32, 36, 37 and 38).
CDIs scored a median of 5 (range: 0 –8) of a possible 11 on the theory-use variable. The most
common theories used were the social norms approach ( k= 31; see Perkins ( 2002 ) for a review),
the theory of planned behaviour ( k= 13; Ajzen, 1991 ) and social cognitive theory ( k= 9; Bandura,
1986 ). Full study characteristics are reported in Supplemental Tables 3 –5.
Effect of CDIs on alcohol consumption
As seen in Table 1 , CDIs had small effects on alcohol consumption, averaging across time points. The
smallest effect was on HED frequency ( d+= 0.07) and the largest effect was on total consumption
(d+= 0.15). Publication bias was indicated for three of the dependent variables: total (Kendall ’sτ
= .31, p< .001), average (Kendall ’sτ= .32, p= .007) and peak consumption (Kendall ’sτ= .37, p
= .002). Subsequent trim-and- ﬁll resulted in lower effect sizes and the effect on peak consumption
was no longer signiﬁ cant. Signi ﬁcant, moderate-high heterogeneity ( I2=4 1 –69%) was present in
four of the ﬁve analyses. Effect sizes for individual CDIs are seen in Supplemental Table 6 and
funnel plots in Supplemental Figure 1 .
CDIs produced small-to-medium ( d+= 0.16 –0.31), signi ﬁcant effects on all outcomes except drink-
ing frequency, in the short term. In the medium-to-long term, CDIs produced small ( d+= 0.07 –0.12),
signiﬁ cant effects on all outcomes. As reported in Table 2 , effects on total consumption, average con-
sumption and HED frequency were signi ﬁcantly larger at short term than at medium-to-long term.
Moderators of CDI effectiveness step one: univariate analyses
Table 2 presents the univariate meta-regression results using general study characteristics, BCTs and
theory to predict the ﬁve outcomes. For age, results presented in the body of Table 2 are those after
excluding outliers; whereas corresponding analyses including outliers are presented in the notes ofTable 2 .HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 347
CDIs produced signiﬁ cantly greater reductions in peak consumption amongst younger samples
than amongst older samples. Signi ﬁcantly larger reductions in HED frequency and drinking frequency
also occurred in samples with higher proportions of women. CDIs conducted in the USA resulted in
signiﬁ cantly greater reductions in average consumption, peak consumption and HED frequency, and
CDIs conducted in Sweden resulted in signiﬁ cantly smaller reductions in drinking frequency, than did
CDIs conducted elsewhere. CDIs that involved some personal contact resulted in signi ﬁcantly
reduced total consumption, average consumption and peak consumption compared to those
without personal contact.
One BCT was signi ﬁcantly associated with negative outcomes; providing information on the con-
sequences of alcohol consumption (BCT1) resulted in smaller reductions in total consumption anddrinking frequency. Four BCTs were signi ﬁcantly associated with positive outcomes. Providing nor-
mative information (BCT4) was associated with greater reductions in peak consumption and drinking
frequency. Prompting commitment (BCT8) and review of goals (BCT18) were associated with greater
reductions in total consumption. Providing options for additional support (BCT27) was associatedwith greater reductions in HED frequency.
CDIs based on social cognitive theory resulted in signi ﬁcantly larger reductions in drinking fre-
quency and those based on motivational interviewing theory or the social norms approach resultedin signi ﬁcantly larger reductions in average consumption, than those based on notheory. Further, of
those CDIs that used the social norms approach, more-extensive use was associated with signiﬁ cantly
greater reductions in total consumption.
Moderators of CDI effectiveness step two: multivariate analyses
Table 3 presents the effect sizes within each subgroup of the individual moderators that remained
signiﬁ cant in the multivariate analyses. For the regression coef ﬁcients and statistics associated
with these analyses, see Supplemental Table 7. For the full factorial effect sizes by moderators thatremained signiﬁ cant in the multivariate analyses, see Supplemental Table 8.Table 1. CDI effects on ﬁve alcohol consumption measures overall and by time point.

boosting motivation (BCT3), facilitating action planning (BCT15) or barrier identi ﬁcation (BCT21) and
assessing readiness to reduce consumption (BCT29) were not signi ﬁcant when controlling for per-
sonal contact and BCT4.
CDIs were signiﬁ cantly poorer at reducing HED frequency in the longer compared to shorter term,
and amongst samples with more men compared to those with more women. CDIs that provided
feedback on performance (BCT5) produced signi ﬁcantly greater reductions than those that did not
use this technique. Further, only those CDIs that provided feedback to samples of majority womensigniﬁ cantly reduced HED frequency. Location, providing normative information (BCT4), providing
options for additional or later support (BCT27) and the social norms approach were no longer
signiﬁ cant.
CDIs that provided information on consequences (BCT1) produced signi ﬁcantly smaller , non-sig-
niﬁcant reductions in drinking frequency than those that did not use this technique. CDIs that pro-
vided normative information (BCT4) or prompted review of goals (BCT18) each produced larger
reductions than those that did not use these techniques. CDIs that did not provide normative infor-
mation did not signi ﬁcantly reduce drinking frequency. Gender, location, identifying reasons for
wanting and not wanting to reduce consumption (BCT2), boosting motivation (BCT3) and social cog-nitive theory were no longer signi ﬁcant.
Discussion
CDIs produced small, signiﬁ cant effects on total, average and peak consumption, and HED and drink-
ing frequency. The following sections discuss moderators of CDI effectiveness.
Moderators of CDI effectiveness: general study characteristics
CDIs were more effective at reducing HED frequency amongst samples with higher proportions of
women. It might be that men tend to be less responsive to the BCTs used in CDIs. Indeed, whilst pro-
viding feedback on performance effectively reduced HED frequency amongst samples with majoritywomen, this was not the case amongst samples with more men. This interpretation might explain
previous mixed ﬁndings regarding gender (Carey et al., 2009 ,2012 ; Rooke et al., 2010 ). Future
research should identify those techniques that effectively reduce HED frequency amongst men.
No other sample characteristics were associated with CDI outcomes; CDIs appear equally effective
in reducing alcohol consumption regardless of location, age, university student status, proportion
of sample who were heavy drinkers and whether or not participants were mandated to completethe CDI. Although it must be noted that it was not possible to test the association between each
of these moderators and all ﬁve outcomes. As such, these conclusions stand only for the testable
outcomes.
In line with Carey et al. ( 2012 ), there was no association between length of the CDI or number of
sessions and any outcomes. It seems that there was no bene ﬁt in administering multiple-session and
longer CDIs, compared to administering single-session and shorter CDIs, respectively. In contrast, per-
sonal contact did appear to be important. CDIs that involved some personal contact demonstrated
signiﬁ cantly greater reductions in total consumption and peak consumption (but not average con-
sumption or HED frequency), compared to those conducted entirely remotely. It is unclear why
such personal contact might offer bene ﬁt, given that all contact was minimal (e.g., greeting partici-
pants, directing towards a computer). It might be that those participants who are willing to overcometime and practical barriers to attend in-person CDIs have pre-existing higher levels of motivation forchange and, hence, are more responsive to BCTs. Alternatively, it is possible that there are aspects of
the social interaction that facilitate behaviour change, but that are not captured in the extant litera-
ture and therefore not able to be identi ﬁed by meta-regression, however it appeared that the control
groups typically received the same personal contact as their CDI counterparts, so this explanation352 N. BLACK ET AL.
seems less likely. Finally, CDIs were also signiﬁ cantly more effective in reducing total consumption
and HED frequency in the short term than in the longer term.
Moderators of CDI effectiveness: BCTs and theory
Positive outcomes
Across three outcomes, it appeared that normative information (e.g., information on peers ’consump-
tion) was bene ﬁcial in reducing alcohol consumption. Speci ﬁcally, use of the social norms approach
was associated with greater reductions in average consumption and provision of normative infor-
mation was associated with greater reductions in peak consumption and drinking frequency. This
is in line with a meta-analysis linking norms with intention to consume alcohol (Cooke et al.,2014 ). Further, that CDIs that did not use this strategy did not signi ﬁcantly reduce consumption
might suggest that normative information is crucial; however, this interpretation should be con-sidered in light of the small number of CDIs that did not provide this information.
Providing feedback on performance appeared effective in reducing HED frequency. Such feed-
back typically consisted of graphical displays of the participant ’s alcohol consumption and some-
times included information such as the equivalent amount of money spent or calories consumed.It is possible that such summary information allows the participant to evaluate how this behaviour
aligns with other goals that they might hold, including ﬁnancial or health goals, and to develop cog-
nitive dissonance between their goals and behaviour.
Prompting review of progress towards goals appeared effective in reducing drinking frequency.
Such review typically involved comparison of current consumption with previous consumption. If
consumption has decreased, it is possible that such comparisons instil a sense of achievement,which increases self-ef ﬁcacy and motivates further reductions in consumption (e.g., Ashford,
Edmunds, & French, 2010 ; Prestwich, Kellar, et al., 2014 ). Lastly, prompting commitment from the
client there and then appeared effective in reducing total consumption. As discussed by Lokhorst,Werner, Staats, van Dijk, and Gale ( 2011 ), it is possible that such prompts in ﬂuence subsequent
behaviour through a desire for self-consistency.
Negative outcomes
Provision of information about the consequences of alcohol consumption was associated withsmaller reductions in total consumption and drinking frequency and those CDIs utilising this tech-
nique did not signiﬁ cantly reduce drinking frequency. This aligns with results of a meta-analysis
on the role of threatening communication (or ‘fear appeals ’) and ef ﬁcacy in changing behaviour
(Peters, Ruiter, & Kok, 2013 ), which demonstrated that threatening communication had positive
effects on behaviour when response- and/or self-ef ﬁcacy was high, but had no effect when ef ﬁcacy
was low. It might be that ef ﬁcacy was low amongst participants in the current meta-analyses, given
that the majority of samples were not treatment-seeking and that only one-third (31%) of CDIsattempted to boost motivation and self-ef ﬁcacy. If so, the current results extend upon those of
Peters et al. ( 2013 ), suggesting that under low ef ﬁcacy, not only does threatening communication
have no positive effect on alcohol consumption, it might have a negative effect.
Null results
Fourteen techniques (BCTs 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30 and 35) were tested in at leastfour of the ﬁve analyses and demonstrated no relationship with any outcome. There is no evidence to
suggest that inclusion of these techniques in CDIs offers any bene ﬁt in reducing alcohol consump-
tion. Further, in contrast to previous ﬁndings (Webb et al., 2010 ), CDIs that used more BCTs did
not lead to greater reductions than those that used fewer. It is possible that previous results were
driven by the use of speci ﬁc, effective BCTs, rather than the larger numbers of BCTs. As such, it
might be important for intervention developers to focus on including speci ﬁc, effective techniques,
rather than trying to include many techniques.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 353
Six theories were tested in their associations with reductions in alcohol consumption. As described
above, the social norms approach led to positive outcomes; however, there was little-to-no evidence
that use of the other tested theories –the health belief model, motivational interviewing theory,
social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behaviour or the transtheoretical model –improved
CDI outcomes, compared to no theory. Whilst use of motivational interviewing theory and social cog-nitive theory initially appeared to lead to greater reductions, these effects did not remain when con-
trolling for other important moderators. It seems likely that the apparent positive effect of social
cognitive theory was due to its negative correlation with provision of information on the conse-quences of alcohol consumption. CDIs based on social cognitive theory tended to not use this
BCT, and those not based on social cognitive theory tended to use this BCT. Finally, there was also
no evidence that more-extensive use of the theory of planned behaviour improved outcomes overless-extensive use. Overall, these ﬁndings are in line with a broader review of the role of theory in
health –behaviour interventions (Prestwich, Sniehotta, et al., 2014 ), which found that use of social cog-
nitive theory or the transtheoretical model did not improve intervention effectiveness.
It may be that whilst these more-elaborate theories provide good descriptions of behaviour , they
might not provide good explanations of behaviour change (see e.g., Sniehotta, Presseau, & Araújo-
Soares, 2014 ). Second, any discrepancies between individual CDI protocols, delivery and reporting
can lead to noise and increase the chance of null results. Third, some analyses in this study might
have been underpowered to detect true effects. This seems possible in the case of the health
belief model, motivational interviewing theory, social cognitive theory and the transtheoreticalmodel. The analyses using these theories were each based on four-to-six CDIs that utilised the the-
ories. Conversely, this explanation seems less likely in the case of the social norms approach and the
theory of planned behaviour, which were mostly based on larger numbers of CDIs.
Limitations
It should be noted that the design of this study does not allow inferences of causality to be drawn.
Moderators that varied between studies were identi ﬁed, and the associations between these mod-
erators and treatment outcomes were examined. As such, signi ﬁcant results provide direction regard-
ing possible techniques to test using randomised controlled designs, rather than techniques that arenecessarily causing behaviour change.
As is the case with any review of this nature, there are also a number of possible sources of error in
the moderator analyses. These include insuf ﬁcient information in the original manuscripts and poor
ﬁdelity between reporting and practice. Efforts were made to overcome these issues, by directly
accessing the intervention content wherever possible; however, null results should nonetheless be
considered tentatively.
Finally, the effect of measuring alcohol (BCT31) was not evaluated, as all CDI and control groups
utilised this BCT.
3Of the remaining 41 BCTs, 15 (BCTs 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 22, 25, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40
and 42) were not tested due to their rare or non-existent use. As such, this study provides no evidence
regarding their effectiveness. Similarly, eight BCTs (BCTs 8, 9, 18, 19, 23, 33, 34 and 41) were tested in
one-three analyses, based on small numbers (4 –7) of CDIs using the technique. Therefore, non-sig-
niﬁcant associations between these BCTs and outcomes should be interpreted with caution.
Practical recommendations
The strongest positive evidence from this review supports the provision of normative information inreducing average consumption, peak consumption and drinking frequency.
Secondly, results also suggest that providing feedback on performance, prompting commitment
and prompting review of goals might be effective strategies for reducing HED frequency, total con-sumption and drinking frequency, respectively. Finally, the evidence does notsupport the provision
of information about the consequences of alcohol consumption. Whilst CDIs utilising this technique354 N. BLACK ET AL.
effectively reduced total consumption, they did not reduce drinking frequency, and effect sizes were
larger across both outcomes when this technique was not used.
Future research directions
Three key areas for future research stem from this review. First, this review identi ﬁed 23 BCTs (i.e.,
more than half the taxonomy) for which it was not possible to conduct well-powered analyses.Further, other techniques not in the taxonomy have been used to address alcohol consumption,such as training executive function (e.g., Black & Mullan, 2015 ; Houben, Wiers, & Jansen, 2011 ).
Indeed, a recent meta-analysis found that such training appears to be effective in changing healthbehaviours generally (Allom, Mullan, & Hagger, 2015 ). More individual trials are required to test
the effectiveness of these techniques, and the 23 under-tested BCTs, in the context of CDIs for
alcohol consumption.
4Second, this review provided the ﬁrst step in examining the relationship
between BCTs and CDI alcohol outcomes in an individual and additive manner. It is now important
to identify speci ﬁc combinations or interactions between BCTs that are most effective in CDIs for
alcohol consumption. Such a question could be addressed via reviews (e.g., see Dusseldorp, van Gen-ugten, van Buuren, Verheijden, & van Empelen ( 2014 ) and Peters et al., 2013 for two different
approaches) or using individual factorial designs. Finally, this review identi ﬁed that, of the theories
tested, only the social norms approach improved CDI outcomes. It might be wise to focus onsimpler approaches to changing behaviour, such as the social norms approach and speci ﬁc BCTs,
rather than more-elaborate theories, such as the theory of planned behaviour and the transtheore-
tical model, until such time that more-useful, elaborate theories can be built. At the same time, knowl-
edge gained from existing theories can inform this process of furthering the search for speci ﬁc
techniques. Alternatively, more individual trials based on newer theories of health behaviour (e.g.,
temporal self-regulation theory, Hall & Fong, 2007 ; dual process models, Hofmann, Friese, & Wiers,
2008 ,2011 ), would allow examination of whether use of these other theories improve CDI outcomes
compared to both older theories and no theory.
Conclusion
The main aim of this review was to identify the BCTs and theories that are effective in CDIs for redu-
cing alcohol consumption. The small, signi ﬁcant effects found here align with earlier meta-analyses;
however, there were three major and novel ﬁndings. First, personal contact, normative information,
prompting commitment and goal review and providing feedback on performance were associatedwith improved outcomes. Second, provision of information about the consequences of alcohol con-
sumption was associated with poorer outcomes. This ﬁnding is important as in many alcohol settings,
providing information on consequences is the ﬁrst line of intervention; however, in this context it
appears unhelpful. Third, use of more-elaborate theories and more-extensive use of BCTs do notappear to affect CDI outcomes. Finally, the fact that more than half of the BCT taxonomy was not
included in a suf ﬁcient number of CDIs to allow evaluation highlights the need for further research.
Notes
1. Asterisks indicate truncation. For example, drink* would yield results for drink, drinker, drinking, etc.
2. Four of the ﬁve contacted authors responded and provided data for ﬁve of the seven CDIs. The remaining two
CDIs were still included in at least one meta-analysis, due to available data for other outcomes.
3. For those interested, BCT31 has previously been assessed via meta-analysis (McCambridge & Kypri, 2011 ).
4. Though, some BCTs might be dif ﬁcult to adapt to this medium (e.g., BCT37: using reﬂ ective listening).
