Objective: Evaluations of techniques to promote physical activity usually
adopt a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Such designs inform how a tech-
nique performs on average but cannot be used for treatment of individuals.Our objective was to conduct the ﬁrstN-of-1 RCTs of behaviour change tech-
niques with older people and test the effectiveness of the techniques for
increasing walking within individuals.
Design: Eight adults aged 60 –87 were randomised to a 2 (goal-setting vs.
active control) × 2 (self-monitoring vs. active control) factorial RCT over62 days. The time series data were analysed for each single case using linear
regressions.
Main outcome measures: Walking was objectively measured using pedometers.
Results: Compared to control days, goal-setting increased walking in 4 out of
8 individuals and self-monitoring increased walking in 7 out of 8 individuals.
While the probability for self-monitoring to be effective in 7 out of 8 partici-pants was beyond chance ( p= .03), no intervention effect was signi ﬁcant for
individual participants. Two participants had a signi ﬁcant but small linear
decrease in walking over time.
Conclusion: We demonstrate the utility of N-of-1 trials for advancing scien-
tiﬁc enquiry of behaviour change and in practice for increasing older people ’s
physical activity.

Introduction
The randomised controlled trial (RCT) is considered the gold standard design for evalu-
ating the effectiveness of an intervention, including interventions to increase the healthof older people (e.g. Barton,
2000 ). Conventional RCTs are used to estimate the aver-
age effect of an intervention in a population and usually require large sample sizes toachieve adequate statistical power. However, even if a signi ﬁcant positive effect for an

intervention is demonstrated, the average effect often masks the variance within the
intervention group where some individuals may not bene ﬁt or may even perform worse
on the primary outcome (Guyatt et al., 1986 ; Johnston & Johnston, 2013 ). Therefore,
conventional RCTs are limited in that they are unable to identify the mechanisms for
change nor identify within- and between-participant variability in the intervention ’s
effectiveness (Craig et al., 2008 ).N-of-1 trials offer an alternative design to overcome
these limitations with the use of intensive data collection in small samples while stillmaintaining the internal validity of traditional trials such as experimental design andrandomisation to conditions (Craig et al.,
2008 ). In N-of-1 trials, instead of randomising
groups of participants to experimental conditions (intervention or control), individualparticipants are randomised to conditions in a pre-determined order and time series fash-ion whereby each participant is exposed to both the intervention and control group on
different days of the trial period.
The main function of N-of-1 trials is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in
individuals and in so doing provide further data as to the heterogeneity of the effect,test theory and often inform the design of conventional trials (Craig et al.,
2008 ). For
example, the theory of planned behaviour was recently tested in two studies that used aseries of N-of-1 trials and both found partial support for the theory. One study found
the theory to predict at least one of three forms of physical activity in ﬁve of the six
individuals tested, but overall the theory was of variable predictive utility within indi-
viduals and across physical activity behaviours (Hobbs, Dixon, Johnston, & Howie,
2013 ). Another study with individuals with chronic pain found the theory to predict
walking activity, but it rarely predicted limitations in walking and when it did it was inthe opposite direction than hypothesised (Quinn, Johnston, & Johnston,
2013 ). As well
as a tool for scienti ﬁc research, N-of-1 trials can inform best practice in patient care and
in particular for older people (Price & Grimley Evans, 2002 ). For example, N-of-1 trials
have been used to identify optimal treatment for patients (Scuffham et al., 2010 ) and
improve access to expensive medications (Scuffham, Yelland, Nikles, Pietrzak, &
Wilkinson, 2008 ).
However, despite a long history in other psychological disciplines such as clinical
psychology and a more recent history in pharmaceutical medicine (Barlow, Knock, &Hersen,
2008 ; Gabler, Duan, Vohra, & Kravitz, 2011 ), there has been scant use of the
N-of-1 design within health psychological science. This is to the detriment of current
scienti ﬁc understanding of behaviour and behaviour change, as the dominant theoretical
models currently in use, such as the theory of planned behaviour, have been almostentirely evaluated with between-groups designs including conventional RCTs. While
theories may be applicable on average and interventions may be successful on average,
they may not necessarily be successful when applied to individuals (Johnston &Johnston,
2013 ; Molenaar & Campbell, 2009 ). It then follows that the lack of
within-person research impedes health care as practitioners have dif ﬁculty in applying
the evidence-base to their patients (Price & Grimley Evans, 2002 ).
In the current study, we report the ﬁrst, to our knowledge, N-of-1 factorial RCT to
test the effect of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to increase physical activityamong older people. We build upon the ﬁrstN-of-1 factorial RCT of BCTs on physical
activity that although recruited one participant aged 67, was primarily conducted with
young and middle-aged adults with an average age of 36.9 years (Sniehotta, Presseau,Hobbs, & Araújo-Soares,
2012 ). We conducted a partial-replication of this earlier study314 S.R. Nyman et al.
with two BCTs used in control theory (Carver & Scheier, 1982 ). Control theory
proposes a model of self-regulation whereby individuals set themselves a target toachieve and then they monitor their behaviour against that target. If there is a discrep-ancy between the target and behaviour, then either efforts are made to reduce the
discrepancy, or the individual withdraws from the ambition of reaching the target. If
there is no discrepancy between the target and behaviour, then no more effort isundertaken (Carver & Scheier,
1982 ).
The techniques that were tested in the current study were goal-setting and self-moni-
toring. For goal-setting, an individual is asked to de ﬁne something that they want to
achieve, and if this is clear, speci ﬁc and challenging, then they will generally perform
better than simply being asked to try their best (Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002 ). For
self-monitoring, an individual is asked to regularly monitor their behaviour and compare
their progress against their goals. For example, pedometers are used to monitor walking
step counts and have been found to signi ﬁcantly increase physical activity among the
general adult population including older people (Baker et al., 2008 ; Bravata et al.,
2007 ; Fitzsimons, Baker, Gray, Nimmo, & Mutrie, 2012 ). In systematic reviews, both
self-regulatory techniques have been found to be effective, and in particular self-monitoring, for improving healthy eating and physical activity in adults from thegeneral population (Bird et al.,
2013 ; Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, &
Gupta, 2009 ), who are chronically ill (Conn, Hafdahl, Brown, & Brown, 2008 ), and
obese (Dombrowski et al., 2012 ). These self-regulation techniques are also included in
UK national guidelines for improving public health through physical activity and BCTs(National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,
2006 ,2007 ). In the previous
N-of-1 factorial RCT of BCTs (Sniehotta et al., 2012 ), across the 10 participants overall,
goal-setting approached signi ﬁcance and self-monitoring led to a signi ﬁcant increase in
walking. Individually, goal-setting signi ﬁcantly increased walking in two of the 10 par-
ticipants and self-monitoring signi ﬁcantly increased walking in 2 other participants.
However, these ﬁndings with adults of a mean age of 36.9 years cannot be extrapolated
to older populations and requires testing.
Age may in ﬂuence how BCTS are applied and their relative ef ﬁcacy in engaging
individuals to adopt healthy behaviours (e.g. Renner, Spivak, Kwon, & Schwarzer,
2007 ). For example, a study indicated that the use of coping planning –a BCT to
anticipate barriers and mentally simulate successfully overcoming them –mediated the
success of interventions designed to increase physical activity (Scholz, Sniehotta,Burkert, & Schwarzer,
2007 ). However, older adults had a different pattern of using this
technique compared with middle-aged and younger adults; older adults had high levels
of coping planning at baseline and so did not increase in their use of this technique
over time like their younger counterparts. Therefore, further N-of-1 factorial RCTs are
required to test self-regulation techniques within older people ’s walking activity.
Walking was the target health behaviour as it does not require any special skills orequipment, is convenient, self-regulated, inherently safe (Morris & Hardman,
1997 ) and
has been a consistently popular activity among the general population including olderpeople (Canada Fitness Survey,
1983 ; Nathan, Wood, & Giles-Corti, 2014 ; Scholes &
Mindell, 2013 ; Skelton, Young, Walker, & Hoinville, 1999 ). But despite the established
health bene ﬁts of physical activity (Department of Health, Physical Activity, Health
Improvement, and Protection, 2011 ), the general population and older people in particu-
lar are insuf ﬁciently physically active (Department of Health, Physical Activity, HealthPsychology & Health 315
Improvement, and Protection, 2011 ), and the evidence for interventions to increase
walking have only demonstrated ef ﬁcacy rather than effectiveness (Ogilvie et al., 2007 ).
Therefore, further trials are required to establish how best to promote walking amongolder people.
Methods
DesignEight 2 (goal-setting vs. active control) × 2 (self-monitoring vs. active control) factorial
randomised controlled N-of-1 trials were conducted in the south of England. Partici-
pants were randomised daily to either intervention or control conditions (days) over a
period of 62 days independently for goal-setting and self-monitoring. With the factorialdesign, this meant that the interventions were randomised and analysed separately withapproximately 31 days ’data for each condition per participant (on some days partici-
pants did both interventions, on some days none and on other days only one of the twointerventions). The randomisation sequence was computer generated by a blinded mem-ber of the research team. A study period of 62 days was used, similar to the previousN-of-1 RCT (Sniehotta et al.,
2012 ), based on the rule of thumb that 30 participants per
condition arm would provide at least 80% statistical power (Cohen, 1988 ).
Intervention
For goal-setting conditions, participants were requested to set themselves a realistic goal
to achieve each day. The intervention required participants to set themselves a goal forhow many steps they would walk that day and write it down. The active control requiredparticipants to set themselves a goal for how many fruit and vegetables they would con-
sume that day and write it down. For self-monitoring conditions, participants were pro-
vided with two pedometers (Omron Walking Style III, HJ-203-EK) and asked to wear oneof them each day. The intervention required participants to wear a pedometer with the stepcount visible to allow for self-monitoring (open condition). The active control requiredparticipants to wear a pedometer that was covered with tape to prevent participants frombeing able to see the number of steps walked that day (sealed condition).
Measurements
The primary outcome for the study was objectively measured walking behaviour
recorded through daily pedometer step counts. The pedometer used in this study hasbeen validated in previous studies against triaxial accelerometry and direct observation(Steeves et al.,
2011 ; Sugden et al., 2008 ). In the current study, the pedometers were
piloted to ensure equivalent measurement of step counts. Three pedometers were ran-domly selected and placed in the right pocket of a volunteer whose step counts wererecorded over four days on all pedometers to test intra-reliability. The percentage error
from the mean of the three devices was calculated (.68, −2.31, and 1.63%) along with
Cronbach ’sα(.998), which indicated that the pedometers had a very high level of
agreement in measurement of step counts between devices. Thus, any differences instep counts observed during the study within participants would be highly unlikely toresult from measurement error.316 S.R. Nyman et al.
Participants
Prior to recruitment, the study was approved by the Bournemouth University, School of
Tourism Research Ethics Committee. Participants were 10 adults aged 60+ who were
recruited from a weekly aerobic exercise class for the over 60s held at a church hall. Tobe included in the study, each participant had to be aged 60+, living in their own home(not in residential care) and able to commit to the study for the whole duration. Afterparticipants had consented to take part in the study, they completed a health screeningquestionnaire (Australian Sports Commission,
2000 ) to ensure they were ﬁt to partici-
pate. They were then provided with a pedometer to wear for one week with no ran-domisation to conditions. This served to familiarise participants with the study
requirements, get used to wearing the pedometer each day, and avoid future dropouts
from the study. After the ﬁrst week with no randomisation, one participant declined to
continue with the study. In addition, after the study was completed, another participantwas excluded from the analysis as they had rarely worn the pedometer and providedonly minimal data over the study period (69% data missing). Therefore, a total of eightparticipants were included in the statistical analysis: ﬁve females and three males aged
60–87 (M= 71.75, SD = 9.63).
Procedure
The intention was to contact participants each morning via mobile phone text message
as conducted previously with younger adults (Sniehotta et al.,
2012 ). However, the par-
ticipants reported that they did not frequently use mobile phones and did not wish to benotiﬁed of condition allocation by text message. Therefore, the study protocol was
changed and instead, participants agreed to be instructed of allocation to experimentalconditions using a series of ordered and sealed envelopes and opening one of them each
morning. Each envelope contained a message indicating the type of goal to be set and
pedometer to be worn for that day. Each week, a researcher met the participants atthe community hall where they undertook their exercise class. During the class, theresearcher recorded the pedometer step counts for the previous week and issued thenext set of envelopes to be opened for the following week. At these meetings, partici-pants were asked if they had tampered with the devices, such as peeling off the tape toview step counts (in active control condition vs. self-monitoring) or shaking thepedometers to arti ﬁcially increase the step count. Participants volunteered that on occa-
sion they had done either of these, and on these days the data were excluded due to
violation of experiment condition (see Table
1).
Analysis
Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS.20. Descriptive statistics were ﬁrst calcu-
lated for the overall sample and each participant. As the data contained distributionsthat had some abnormality (mainly due to outliers), medians and interquartile ranges are
reported. Thereafter, the data were analysed for each participant separately. The data
were then prepared for inferential statistics by addressing missing cases andautocorrelation.Psychology & Health 317
Missing cases
Across all the participants, 89 cases (data for one day) out of 496 were missing, the
majority of which had a record of zero ( n= 78) due to either violation of experiment
condition or the participant not wearing the pedometer on the study day due to illness /
forgetting (see Table 1). A further 11 cases were deemed missing due to a record of
below 100 steps that was deemed as an invalid entry as this would equate to less than1 min ’s walking activity (Tudor-Locke et al.,
2011 ). Missing cases were input using
Amelia II software (AmeliaView 1.7.2, http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia ) that uses a
bootstrapping-based algorithm to create multiple imputations to ﬁll the missing cases.
This approach is sensitive to time-series designs and is considered superior to otherapproaches in dealing with missing data such as listwise deletion and mean substitution(Honaker & King,
2010 ). Amelia II generates a default ﬁve data-sets with each case
imputed in accordance with the uncertainty of variation in imputed values. As recom-
mended, rather than combining them into one data-set for analysis, the ﬁve data-sets
were analysed separately and then the results were combined (Honaker & King, 2010 ).
After imputation, there were ﬁve data-sets with 62 days data for each participant, the
results from which were combined and represented 62 data points per participant.Across the participants, the combined analyses had 245 and 251 days, respectively, forthe goal-setting vs. control comparison, and 246 and 250 days, respectively, for theself-monitoring vs. control comparison.
Autocorrelation
The 40 data-sets (5 per participant) were then analysed separately. Before conducting the
inferential analyses, each data-set was ﬁrst checked for autocorrelation. Autocorrelation
is likely to be present in time series data-sets as each participant ’s daily step count couldTable 1. Frequency and reasons for missing data by each participant.

Notes: We de ﬁned a day as missing if the step count was lower than 100 steps. Data were considered unac-
ceptable due to violation of experiment condition for one of two reasons: (1) when step counts were more
than four times higher than the average steps per day for a given participant, as this indicated that thepedometers had been in ﬂuenced (shaken) by the participant, which was acknowledged when asked; (2) when
participants removed the seal and viewed the step count on the pedometer device on days when they wereallocated to the active control (versus self-monitoring) and had acknowledged that they did this.318 S.R. Nyman et al.
be correlated with previous or later step counts recorded during the study period. Where
signiﬁcant autocorrelations were identi ﬁed, we accounted for them using pre-whitening,
a standard procedure described previously (Hobbs et al., 2013 ; Quinn et al., 2013 ). The
pre-whitening procedure removes autocorrelation from the data to satisfy the assumption
of parametric tests that each day ’s data should be independent (and not correlated) to
allow for further analysis. Where required, this was conducted in each instance on themost signi ﬁcant lag identi ﬁed up to a maximum of seven lags (one week), as conducted
previously, because removal of the largest auto-correlation relationship is most likely tosuccessfully pre-whiten the data (Hobbs et al.,
2013 ). For example, if lag1 had the
largest autocorrelation, this was pre-whitened to account for ﬁrst-order correlations (that
step counts are correlated with step counts recorded the day before). Pre-whitening wasperformed by creating a time series version of the step count dependent variable for the
most signi ﬁcant lag (e.g. lag1). The new lagged variable was then regressed onto the
original variable and the unstandardised residuals were saved as the new pre-whiteneddependent variable to be used for the analysis. Where pre-whitening was conducted, thenew pre-whitened variable was then re-checked for the presence of signi ﬁcant autocorre-
lation. Pre-whitening successfully removed autocorrelation for every data-set except forthree imputations for participant 1 (see footnote, Table
3).
Linear regressions
For each time series in each participant, the outcome variable of step count (original or
pre-whitened as applicable) was entered into a linear regression as a function of interven-tion condition using dummy coding (1 = intervention day and 0 = active control day).Analyses were conducted separately for goal-setting (vs. control) and self-monitoring(vs. control) as the study was not powered to detect interaction effects (as was the casein the previous study by Sniehotta et al.,
2012 ). Each linear regression was checked for
meeting parametric assumptions by examining the residuals. Speci ﬁcally, Durbin-Watson
tests were conducted and all the values were close to 2 (and not below 1 or above 3),
indicating the residuals were free from autocorrelation. Histograms of the standardisedresiduals were inspected and they all indicated patterns representing normal distributions.While on occasion one or two outliers were present, the results of tests to identify in ﬂu-
ential cases indicated that each outlier had no signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on the results and so
were retained in the analyses (with all Cook ’s distance values below 1, all leverage val-
ues close to the average and all Mahalanobis distances below 2). Once each analysis wasperformed, the results were combined as described previously (Hobbs et al.,
2013 ; Quinn
et al., 2013 ). The mean values for Bandpare presented, and the average standard error
is presented, which was multiplied by a factor that corrects for bias. Cohen ’sdeffect
sizes were calculated by comparing the mean difference in step counts divided by thepooled standard error. In addition, we conducted linear regressions to test for linear timetrends that could indicate possible carryover effects of the interventions. For each timeseries in each participant, the original outcome variable of step count (not pre-whitened)was entered into a linear regression as a function of cumulative day (from 1 through to62) and the results combined in the same way described above. While the majority of
Durbin-Watson values were close to 2 (and not below 1 or above 3) indicating the
residuals were free from autocorrelation, some values were close to 1 and so should beinterpreted cautiously for participants 1, 2 and 6.Psychology & Health 319
Examination of consistency of effect
Finally, we examined the consistency of the effect of the interventions both across all
the participants and then for each individual. For examination across all the participants,
for each intervention, we calculated the binomial probability of the number of partici-pants who had a result in favour of the intervention compared with the control. Forboth goal-setting and self-monitoring interventions, this was calculated from the proba-bility of success occurring (.5, i.e. result in favour or not in favour of the intervention),the number of successes and the number of trials in the experiment (8, i.e. the totalnumber of participants) using a freely available calculator (Soper,
2015 ). We then exam-
ined the descriptive statistics for each participant to observe the direction of effects
across the two interventions (i.e. if goal-setting led to an increase in step counts for a
given participant, we examined whether self-monitoring also led to an increase in stepcounts for this participant).
Results
The median step count was 5409 (interquartile range = 6265), which equates to an aver-
age of approximately 54 min walking per day (Tudor-Locke et al.,
2011). Descriptive
statistics for the step counts are presented in Table 2as a function of intervention
condition.
Goal-setting
Overall, compared to the control, the intervention led to a median increase of 922 steps
per day. Four of the eight participants had higher median step counts in the goal-settingintervention condition compared to the control days. One participant had a median
difference of over 1000 step counts from the goal-setting intervention, with an increase
of 1663 steps (participant 9), equivalent to over 15 min extra walking per day(Tudor-Locke et al.,
2011). Three participants had moderate increases in walking from

goal-setting of 559 (participant 10), 488 (participant 1) and 318 steps (participant 3).
However, compared to the control days, for one participant, goal-setting led to anincrease of only 9 steps (participant 2), and three participants had lower step counts inthe goal-setting condition, with median differences of −672 (participant 8), −540 (partic-
ipant 6), and −321 steps (participant 4). However, none of the combined results from the
linear regression analyses were signi ﬁcant (see Table
3). A non-signi ﬁcant and small
effect was observed in favour of the intervention overall ( d= .08, 95% CI = −.42 to
.58), and non-signi ﬁcant and small to small-medium effects were found both in favour
of the intervention and the active control group for the participants individually (seeTable
3).
Self-monitoring
Overall, compared to the control, the intervention led to a median increase of 950 steps
per day. Seven of the eight participants had higher median step counts in the self-monitoring intervention condition compared to the control days. One participant had amedian difference of just under 1000 step counts from the self-monitoring intervention,with an increase of 980 steps (participant 9), equivalent to almost 10 min extra walkingper day (Tudor-Locke et al.,
2011 ). Six participants had moderate increases in walking
from self-monitoring of 581 (participant 10), 314 (participant 2), 312 (participant 4),
310 (participant 3), 257 (participant 1) and 119 steps (participant 6). However, com-
pared to the control days, one participant had a lower step count in the interventioncondition, with a median difference of −1325 steps (participant 8). However, again,
none of the combined results from the linear regression analyses were signi ﬁcant (see
Table
3). A non-signi ﬁcant and small effect was observed in favour of the intervention
overall ( d= .11, 95% CI = −.39 to .61), and non-signi ﬁcant and small to small-medium
effects were found both in favour of the intervention and the active control group forthe participants individually (see Table
3).
Linear time trend
For six participants, the combined results from the linear regressions showed no signi ﬁ-
cant time trend for an increase (participants 1, 3, 6 and 10) or decrease (participants 2and 9) in steps over the course of the study period. However, for participants 4 and 8,the combined results from the linear regression analyses showed a signi ﬁcant but small
decrease in steps over time (see Table
3).
Consistency of effect
The probability of goal-setting to lead to an increase in step counts in four out of eight
participants was 1/3.66 and not signi ﬁcant ( p= .27). However, the probability of
self-monitoring to lead to an increase in step counts in seven out of eight participantswas 1/32 and signi ﬁcant ( p= .03). There was consistency in the effect of the interven-
tions across ﬁve of the eight participants: participant 9 had the highest increase in walk-
ing from both the goal-setting and self-monitoring interventions at around 1000 steps or
more. Participants 1, 3 and 10 had a moderate increase in walking from both interven-tions, and participant 8 had a lower step count from both interventions. However, forPsychology & Health 321

Notes: Linear time trend was analysed using the original values with missing cases imputed because pre-whitening would remove the effect being teste d, while goal-setting
and self-monitoring were analysed using the pre-whitened values with missing cases imputed. For the goal-setting and self-monitoring analyses, pr e-whitening was required
twice for participant two (at lag1 for imputations 2 and 5), once for participant three (at lag1 for imputation 1), three times for participant 6 (at lag 1 for imputations 3 –5),
once for participant 8 (at lag2 for imputation 4), once for participant 9 (at lag4 for imputation 1) and twice for participant 10 (at lag1 for imputation 2 and lag5 for imputa-
tion 3). For participant 1, pre-whitening was required in four instances (at lag1 for imputations 2 –5). However, in three instances, pre-whitening did not successfully
remove signi ﬁcant autocorrelation (imputations 2 and 4 –5). Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby the combined results of including all ﬁve imputations
(one with no autocorrelation and four pre-whitened at lag1) were compared with only including the two imputations where pre-whitening was successfu lly removed (one
with no autocorrelation and one pre-whitened at lag1). In the table, we report the results with all ﬁve imputations combined. When only the two imputations that had auto-
correlation successfully removed with pre-whitening were included, the combined results were weaker for both goal-setting ( B= 156, SE = 568, p= .74, 95% CI = −958,
1270) and self-monitoring ( B= 111, SE = 528, p= .78, 95% CI = −925, 1146). The effect sizes (Cohen ’sd) were calculated using the means and standard deviations of
the original data before imputation of missing cases.322 S.R. Nyman et al.
participants 2, 4 and 6, while they all had a moderate increase in walking from the self-
monitoring intervention, they had either no increase in walking (participant 2) or lowerstep counts from the goal-setting intervention (participants 4 and 6).
Discussion
This study reported the ﬁrst test of BCTs among older people with the use of N-of-1
factorial RCTs. Overall, goal-setting and self-monitoring both increased step counts byan average of over 900 steps per day, which equates to approximately over nine min-utes extra daily walking. For goal-setting, there was a trend for an increase in stepcounts for four of the eight participants; however, the probability of this result occurringwas not signi ﬁcant. In the single case analyses, step counts were on average over 1600
higher on goal-setting days in one participant; however, goal-setting had no effect for
one participant and a negative effect on walking for three others. For self-monitoring,there was a trend for an increase in step counts for seven of the eight participants, ofwhich the probability of this result occurring was signi ﬁcant. In the single case analy-
ses, step counts were on average just under 1000 step counts higher on self-monitoringdays in one participant; however, self-monitoring had a negative effect on walking forone participant. From the combined results of the linear regressions, no signi ﬁcant dif-
ference was found for either goal-setting or self-monitoring BCTs to increase walking
among the eight individuals in this study. We also found a small signi ﬁcant decrease in
walking over time in two participants.
In comparison with the previous factorial N-of-1 RCTs with almost exclusively
young and middle-aged adults (Sniehotta et al.,
2012 ), a similar pattern of results from
the descriptive statistics were observed at the overall and individual levels in favour ofboth the goal-setting and self-monitoring interventions compared to control days. Thiswould suggest that these two self-regulation BCTs may be of similar utility (with asmall to small-medium effect) when employed with the general healthy adult population
regardless of age. In addition, in the current study there was a trend for consistency of
effect of both goal-setting and self-monitoring interventions across participants, with astronger effect observed for self-monitoring. However, the trends observed in our studywere not supported by signi ﬁcant single case analyses, and Sniehotta et al. (
2012 ) did
notﬁnd consistency in the effect of the BCTs in their study. While the use of different
BCTs may produce interaction effects and demonstrate additive bene ﬁt of combining
techniques, N-of-1 RCTs can identify inconsistencies in intervention effects within and
between participants that is obscured in conventional RCT designs, and highlight that
not every behaviour change technique works for every participant. It is also of note that
in the Sniehotta et al. ’s study four participants showed small signi ﬁcant linear time
trend effects and we identi ﬁed a similar effect in two participants. While the direction
was positive in the previous study and negative in our study, these ﬁndings suggest that
BCTs have potential for carryover effects across conditions (whether they lead to anincrease or decrease in the target behaviour) and future research may adopt moresophisticated trial designs to better account for the strength of such effects (Sniehottaet al.,
2012 ).
There were three points of divergence between the current and prior factorial N-of-1
RCT study (Sniehotta et al., 2012 ). First, participants in the current study did not wish
to be noti ﬁed of their daily experimental condition by text message, but instead agreedPsychology & Health 323
to be informed by opening a sealed envelope each morning. This may be of surprise
given that the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communica-tions industries has reported that 94% of adults in the UK own or use a mobile phone(Ofcom,
2013 ). However, the same regulator recently reported that 38% of adults aged
65+ were not using a mobile phone (Ofcom, 2011 ), and identi ﬁed several barriers to
the industry for better addressing the needs of older people (Freeman & Lessiter, 2009 ).
While our sample indicated a lack of con ﬁdence in daily use of mobile phone technol-
ogy (some did not own a mobile phone and others who did were not familiar withusing text messages, and so interest in the study was low when mobile phone use wasa requirement), many other older people are likely to have access to and be pro ﬁcient
in the use of technology such as smartphones that have other applications that could beused to automatically collect data for N-of-1 RCTs (e.g. accelerometers to measure
physical activity). Future research could compare different mediums and frequency of
contacts in which experimental conditions are communicated to participants, data arecollected from them and different ways of communicating BCT instructions. For exam-ple, text messaging could be used as an alert or reminder service, which has been iden-tiﬁed as a powerful behaviour change tool in isolation and when used to supplement
website-based interventions (Orr & King,
2015 ; Webb, Joseph, Yardley, & Michie,
2010 ).
A second point of divergence with the previous N-of-1 RCT study (Sniehotta et al.,
2012 ) was that participants in this study completed on average over 2800 step counts
fewer compared to the younger participants assessed by Sniehotta et al. This would beexpected given that the sample recruited for the current study was older by an averageof 35 years. In our study, participants were requested to set their own step count goals,but this difference in step counts achieved highlights the need to tailor goal-setting tothe abilities and aspirations of the individual should goals be co-created by both theparticipant and interventionist. Future studies could examine in more detail the physicalactivity of individuals and make more ﬁne-grained comparisons between age groups.
For example, accelerometers could be used to ascertain the intensity and duration of
bouts of physical activity completed between intervention and control conditions acrossage groups. In addition, with the use of smart homes and global positioning systemtechnology, physical activity data collected on smartphones could be wirelessly con-nected with rooms around the house and points in the local area to indicate where andwhen people of different ages are most physically active (e.g. Demiris & Thompson,
2012 ; Fay, 2014 ). This would afford dynamic integration of environmental factors that
are known to predict physical activity, such as access to services in the local
neighbourhood (Eisenstein et al., 2011).
A third point of divergence with the previous N-of-1 RCT study (Sniehotta et al.,
2012 ) was that the current study did not obtain statistically signi ﬁcant differences for the
eight participants despite having a similar number of data points per participant (ourstudy had two extra days per participant). For the one participant aged 67 in Sniehottaet al. ’s study, this participant had a higher number of step counts in the goal-setting
(+297 steps) and self-monitoring conditions (+1453 steps), of which the latter ﬁnding
was signi ﬁcant. However, we reported lower median step counts, and so the proportion
of within-participant variance in relation to median step counts was far higher in our
study. This was re ﬂected in lower Bvalues in relation to the SE values for all bar one of
the participants (see Table
3). Despite some signi ﬁcantﬁndings, Sniehotta et al. observed324 S.R. Nyman et al.
a lack of statistical power in their study and the current study was similarly limited due
to high levels of within-participant variance in walking per day. A further limitation ofour study was a high level of missing data across participants, which may have reducedpower to detect signi ﬁcant differences given we had to rely on imputed data to replace
missing cases (whereas Sniehotta et al.,
2012 were able to use complete data from each
participant). Our results highlight that the effect size of interventions and resultant powervaries between participants in N-of-1 trials. In our study, non-signi ﬁcant effect sizes
ranged −.01 to .38 for goal-setting and −.07 to .47 for self-monitoring, which suggests
that a larger volume of data points to increase power may have led to detection of signif-icant differences in some participants. For other participants, the interventions appearedineffective. While future studies could collect a larger volume of data per participant toincrease statistical power, this will increase participant burden and potentially lead to
greater attrition levels, and this strategy will only be effective for interventions with
above small effect sizes.
Implications for practice
Based on the ﬁndings of the current study, we would recommend that interventionists
make use of N-of-1 RCTs with older people to identify which BCTs might be most
effective to increase individuals ’physical activity. While further research is required,
we found trends that would support the use of goal-setting and self-monitoring BCTs.
Other techniques not tested in this study could also be used (Michie et al.,
2013 ).N-of-
1 RCTs could also be of use for explaining complex patterns of change in patient healthbehaviours, as recommended in a recent study that found several factors to predictmaintenance of physical activity (Hekler et al.,
2013 ). As for implementation of BCTs,
the provision of training and instrumentation for staff has been highlighted to overcomebarriers to the use of goal-setting in shared clinical decision-making (Schulman-Green,Naik, Bradley, McCorkle, & Bogardus,
2006 ).
One application of N-of-1 RCTs that may be of particular bene ﬁt in interventions
with older people is facilitating the tailoring of BCTs (Cushing, Walters, & Hoffman,
2014 ). The aim of tailoring a health intervention is to make it more personally relevant
to the individual and thereby making it more effective (Kreuter, Farrell, Olevitch, &Brennan,
2000 ). For example, a study demonstrated that a tailored version of
website-based information was more persuasive in promoting physical activity amongolder people compared with a generic control version (Nyman & Yardley,
2009 ). The
use of N-of-1 trials offers a whole new layer of possibility for tailoring interventions in
that individuals could be better matched to BCTs if N-of-1 data were obtained alongside
or prior to implementation of a behaviour change programme (Sniehotta et al., 2012 ).
For example, a range of techniques could be used in N-of-1 RCTs to determine which
technique(s) work particularly well for a particular individual.
Limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research
Given the small sample and short study period, it was not possible to identify variables
that predict which participants would bene ﬁt from the interventions and which would
not. Future studies could be conducted that combine within- and between-groupsPsychology & Health 325
approaches to explore the variables that may predict positive responses to interventions
with the use of multilevel modelling (Curran & Bauer, 2011 ; Johnston & Johnston,
2013 ). For example, a previous study with young adults found that within-person but
not between-person variance in daily physical activity was signi ﬁcantly associated with
satisfaction with life (Maher et al., 2013 ). Another study with university students found
that daily time in the pursuit of goals that con ﬂicted with their regular physical activity
negatively predicted objectively measured physical activity (Presseau, Tait, Johnston,Francis, & Sniehotta,
2013 ). In addition, with N-of-1 trials one cannot investigate
beliefs that will have carryover effects. For example, it would not be feasible to manip-ulate outcome expectancy beliefs within an N-of-1 RCT, which have been shown to
vary weekly in the ﬁrst four weeks of initiation of physical activity in a sample of pre-
viously inactive adults (Loehr, Baldwin, Rosen ﬁeld, & Smits,
2014 ). However, N-of-1
designs are more suited to behavioural techniques such as those tested in the current
study and could be combined with other interventions for example through stepped-wedge designs (Johnston & Johnston,
2013 ). Also, further research could screen larger
samples to purposively select participants into N-of-1 RCTs to produce samples that are
homogenous or strati ﬁed on key variables such as high body mass index to identify
processes of behaviour change that are effective for speci ﬁc patient groups.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated the utility of using an N-of-1 design to test the effect of BCTs
among older people. While no combined linear regressions were signi ﬁcant, trends were
observed that would suggest the self-regulation interventions were effective for someindividuals but not all. Self-monitoring was also found to have a more consistent effectacross participants. With advances in technology for monitoring and providing feedbackto individuals based on their activity levels, there is scope for N-of-1 designs to play an
important role in understanding how best to increase physical activity among older peo-
ple with the use of BCTs.
