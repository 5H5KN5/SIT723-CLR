ABSTRACT
Music therapy is increasingly being used as an intervention for stress
reduction in both medical and mental healthcare settings. Music therapyis characterized by personally tailored music interventions initiated by a
trained and quali ﬁed music therapist, which distinguishes music therapy
from other music interventions, such as ‘music medicine ’, which concerns
mainly music listening interventions o ﬀered by healthcare professionals.
To summarize the growing body of empirical research on music therapy,
a multilevel meta-analysis, containing 47 studies, 76 e ﬀect sizes and
2.747 participants, was performed to assess the strength of the e ﬀects of
music therapy on both physiological and psychological stress-relatedoutcomes, and to test potential moderators of the intervention e ﬀects.
Results showed that music therapy showed an overall medium-to-largeeﬀect on stress-related outcomes ( d= .723, [.51 –.94]). Larger e ﬀects were
found for clinical controlled trials (CCT) compared to randomizedcontrolled trials (RCT), waiting list controls instead of care as usual (CAU)or other stress-reducing interventions, and for studies conducted in Non-
Western countries compared to Western countries. Implications for both
music therapy and future research are discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Stress is a well-known risk factor for the onset and progression of a range of physical and emotional
problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, anxiety disorders, depression, and burnout (Amer-
ican Psychological Association [APA], 2017 ; Australian Psychological Society [APS], 2015 ; Steptoe &
Kivimäki, 2012 ). To cope with stress and the demands of today ’s society, millions of people over
the world use tranquilizing medications, which have a lot of negative contraindications and sideeﬀects, including substance dependence and abuse (Bandelow et al., 2015 ; Olfson et al., 2015 ;
Puetz et al., 2015 ; World Health Organization [WHO], 2010 ). Therefore, it is important to examine
the eﬀects of non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions for the prevention and management
of stress (de Witte et al., 2020a ; Kamioka et al., 2014 ; Martin et al., 2018 ; Raglio et al., 2015 ).

For decades and all over the world music has been used to provide calmness and relaxation. These
stress reducing qualities are the most widely studied e ﬀects of music (Chanda & Levitin, 2013 ;d eW i t t e
et al., 2020a ; Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008 ;K o e l s c h , 2015 ;M e h re ta l . , 2019 ). Therefore, music therapy inter-
ventions are increasingly being used to reduce stress and enhance the well-being of clients across a
variety of clinical populations (Agres et al., 2020 ;B a i n b r i d g ee ta l . , 2020 ; Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008 ;
Kemper & Danhauer, 2005 ; Koelsch, 2012 ,2015 ; Landis-Shack et al., 2017 ; Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014 ).
Music therapy is speciﬁ cally characterized by using the speciﬁ c qualities of music in a therapeutic
relationship with a music therapist. This distinguishes music therapy from other music interventions,mostly oﬀ ered by medical or healthcare professionals and referred to as music medicine (Agres et al.,
2020 ; Bradt et al., 2013b ; de Witte et al., 2020a ; Gold et al., 2011 ; Magee, 2019 ). The body of research
on music therapy is much smaller compared to the amount of research on music listening interven-tions. Our previous meta-analytic review (de Witte et al., 2020a ) was focused on the eﬀ ects of music
interventions in general and included mainly music listening interventions. In none of these studies atrained music therapist was involved.
In order to integrate the available knowledge on the e ﬀects of music therapy on stress, we con-
ducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative studies testing the e ﬀects of music
therapy on both physiological and psychological stress-related outcomes in mental and medicalhealthcare settings.
The inﬂ uence of music on the stress response
Stress can be regarded as the quality of an experience, produced through a person-environmenttransaction that may result in physiological or psychological distress (Aldwin, 2007 ). Responses to
stress can be related to both increased physiological arousal and speci ﬁc emotional states, while
the underlying systems of those responses regulate and aﬀ ect each other during stress (e.g., de
Witte et al., 2020a ; Linnemann et al., 2017 ; McEwen & Gianaros, 2010 ). The stress reducing eﬀ ect
of music therapy interventions is explained by music itself as well as the continuous attunement
of music by the music therapist to the individual needs of a patient.
Music listening is strongly associated with stress reduction by the decrease of physiological arousal
as indicated by reduced cortisol levels, lowered heart rate, and decreases in mean arterial pressure (e.g.,Burrai et al., 2016 ; Koelsch et al., 2016 ;K r e u t ze ta l . , 2012 ; Linnemann et al., 2015 ). Music can also reduce
negative emotions and feelings, such as subjective worry, state anxiety, restlessness or nervousness
(Akin & Iskender, 2011 ; Cohen et al., 1983 ; Pittman & Kridli, 2011 ;P r i t c h a r d , 2009 ), and increase positive
emotions and feelings, such as happiness (Jäncke, 2008 ; Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008 ). This is in line with
studies showing that music modulates activity in brain structures, such as the amygdala and the meso-limbic reward brain system, which are known to be involved in emotional and motivational processes
(Blood & Zatorre, 2001 ;K o e l s c h ,2015 ; Koelsch et al., 2016 ,2016 ; Levitin, 2009 ;M o o r e , 2013 ;S a l i m p o o r
et al., 2013 ; Zatorre, 2015 ). Furthermore, it is assumed that the systematic application of music in
therapy in response to the needs of the patient(s) can strengthen the impact of music (Agres et al.,2020 ;B r a d t&D i l e o , 2014 ). In addition, empirical evidence shows that music activities in a group
may result in synchronization among group members, which leads to positive feelings of togetherness
and bonding (Linnemann et al., 2016 ;T a r re ta l . , 2014 ). These feelings of togetherness and bonding
may be explained by the release of the neurotransmitters endorphin and oxytocin, which both playan important role in the defensive response to stress (e.g., Amir et al., 1980 ;D i e fe ta l . , 2018 ;M y i n t
et al., 2017 ). Lastly, music listening can help to lower stress levels through its quality to provide ‘dis-
traction ’from stress-increasing feelings or thoughts (Bernatzky et al., 2011 ; Chanda & Levitin, 2013 ).
Music therapy
Music therapy can be de ﬁned as the clinical and evidence-informed use of music interventions to
accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship in order to achieve physical,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 135
emotional, mental, social and cognitive needs (Aalbers et al., 2019 ; Agres et al., 2020 ; American
Music Therapy Association [AMTA], 2018 ; de Witte et al., 2020a ). Music therapy has been applied
as a therapeutic intervention in a wide spectrum of health care contexts, such as mental health
care, forensic care, nursing homes, rehabilitation, and oncology (e.g., Agres et al., 2020 ; Kamioka
et al., 2014 ; Martin et al., 2018 ). Although the term ‘music therapy ’sometimes refers to any kind
of use of music as an intervention in health care settings, music therapy should be o ﬀered by a
trained music therapist, who is a licensed and quali ﬁed therapist with the required knowledge
in psychology, medicine, and music (Agres et al., 2020 ; AMTA, 2018 ; Bradt et al., 2015 ; Magee,
2019 ).
Music therapists use the unique qualities of music (e.g., melody, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, pitch)
within the therapeutic relationship to access patient ’s emotions and memories, to address social
experiences or in ﬂuence behavior (Bruscia, 1987 ; Wheeler, 2015 ). This speciﬁ c kind of responsivity
to the patient ’s needs can be regarded as the key competencies of the music therapist, referring
to the processes that take place between therapist and patient supporting coordination, empathy
and shared perspectives (Agres et al., 2020 ). More speciﬁ cally, during music therapy the music thera-
pist attunes to the patient by adjusting the music created as an immediate response to the patient ’s
needs (Aalbers et al., 2019 ; Magee, 2019 ).
To work on patient-therapist attunement, the music therapist synchronizes with the patient
moment-by-moment, which may be considered as a mirroring technique. This means that the(musical) actions of the music therapist and the patient can become simultaneous and regulatedthrough time, yielding a similar expression in movement, matching pulse, rhythm, dynamics and/
or melody (Aalbers et al., 2019 ; Bruscia, 1987 ; Schumacher & Calvet, 2008 ). For example, the music
therapist may in ﬂuence patients ’perceived stress during musical improvization by synchronizing
with the patient ’s music-making, subsequently changing the musical expression by playing slower
and less loudly. This speciﬁ c way of patient-therapist attunement is commonly used in music
therapy practice and refers to the so-called Iso Principle (e.g., Altshuler, 1948 ; Heiderscheit &
Madson, 2015 ). Literature shows that the tempo and loudness are important for the experienced
intensity of the music (Gabrielsson & Lindström, 2010 ), and music with a slow steady rhythm may
provide stress reduction by altering inherent body rhythms, such as heart rate (Thaut et al., 1999 ;
Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014 ).
The music therapist uses several types of interventions, which can be
oﬀered to a group of patients as well as individually. The number, frequency, and duration of the
music therapy session may vary widely, and depend on the targeted outcome, patients ’preferences,
and/or the setting in which the music therapy is o ﬀered (Agres et al., 2020 ; AMTA, 2018 ). Further-
more, music therapy interventions can be subdivided in two broad categories: active and receptive
interventions (Magee, 2019 ; Magee et al., 2017 ; Wheeler, 2015 ).
Active interventions involve the patient doing something with the music during the music
therapy sessions, such as musical improvization, composing music or songs, movement to music,
or singing or vocalizing. According to both literature and clinical practice, it seems that musicalimprovization is the most used intervention within music therapy, meaning that patient(s) and thera-
pist improvize on musical instruments they have chosen and play together freely or with a given
structure (Gold et al., 2009 ; Wigram, 2004 ). In receptive music therapy interventions, the patient is
not actively making music, but rather responds to music provided by the music therapist, such as
listening to live or prerecorded music (Bruscia, 1998 ; Magee, 2019 ; Wheeler, 2015 ). The patient
listens to the music and may process verbally their own emotions and/or experiences. During
both active and receptive music interventions music therapists make speci ﬁc use of the unique qual-
ities of music (also known as ‘musical components’ ), such as rhythm, pitch, tempo, dynamics, melody
and harmony, to facilitate and promote personal contact, communication, learning, mobilization,expression and other relevant goals (Agres et al., 2020 ; Câmara et al., 2013 ; Taets et al., 2019 ;
Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014 ; Wheeler, 2015 ).
Summarized, whereas music medicine does not involve a personal therapeutic process, music
therapy requires such a process, characterized by personally tailored music interventions initiated136 M. DE WITTE ET AL.
by a trained/quali ﬁed music therapist (de Witte et al., 2020a ; Leubner & Hinterberger, 2017 ). These
music therapy interventions can be divided in receptive music therapy interventions (music listen-
ing) or active music therapy interventions (live music-making), and are speci ﬁcally characterized
by musical attunement, facilitated by the music therapist, which distinguishes music therapy fromother music interventions.
Music therapy versus music medicine
Research on music therapy is fast-growing (de Witte et al., 2020a ). The eﬀ ects of music listening inter-
ventions, such as ‘music medicine ’, are mainly caused by the general in ﬂuence of music on the stress
response, whereas the eﬀ ects of music therapy may also be explained by the therapeutic relation-
ship through patient-therapist attunement by the use of music. Dileo ( 2006 ) stated that music
therapy is more eﬀ ective than ‘music medicine ’interventions, and attributed this di ﬀerence to the
fact that music therapists individualize their interventions to meet patients ’speciﬁ c needs (Bradt
et al., 2010 ; Dileo, 1999 ,2006 ).
In a Cochrane review of Bradt et al. ( 2016 ) it was shown that ‘music medicine ’interventions and
music therapy were equally eﬀ ective in decreasing (state) anxiety. Bradt et al. ( 2015 ) compared
‘music medicine ’with music therapy, and also found that both types of interventions were
equally eﬀ ective for anxiety and stress reduction, although 77.4% of the participants expressed a pre-
ference for music therapy for future treatments. This patient ’s preference for music therapy was
related to quality of therapeutic relationships, interactive music making and the possibility of
emotional expression, which is precisely what music therapy distinguishes from music listening
interventions (Bradt et al., 2015 ; Gutgsell et al., 2013 ).
In our previous meta-analytic review on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining the
eﬀects of music interventions on stress-related outcomes (de Witte et al., 2020a ), we showed
that music therapy did have at least as much eﬀ ect on physiological stress-related outcomes ( d
= .423) as ‘music medicine ’(d= .379). However, only 7 studies on music therapy were included
against 54 studies examining music medicine. Therefore, ﬁndings on music therapy were compro-
mised by low generalizability and lack of statistical power to examine factors that might aﬀ ect the
eﬀectiveness of music therapy by means of moderator analyses. Notably, most e ﬀectiveness
studies on music therapy are quasi-experimental, because it is often diﬃ cult to meet the require-
ments for randomization and/or masking procedures (Bradt et al., 2013b ; de Witte et al., 2020a ;
Magee
et al., 2017 ).
The present study
The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis on the e ﬀects of music therapy on both
physiological stress-related arousal (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, hormone levels) and psycho-
logical stress-related experiences (e.g., state anxiety, restlessness or nervousness) in clinical
health care settings. In our previous meta-analysis, we examined the e ﬀect of music interventions
on stress-related outcomes. The included studies primarily used prerecorded music o ﬀered by
medical professionals, whereas music therapy involves a trained music therapist who is responsiveto the needs of the patient and can in ﬂuence emotions and/or behavior of the patient by the use
of music.
In the present meta-analysis, we included both RCTs and quasi-experimental designs with a
control condition (Clinical Controlled Trials [CCT]), accounting for the e ﬀect of study design and
quality in moderator analyses. The inclusion of quasi-experimental studies, which have been con-
ducted under clinically representative conditions, increases external validity of meta-analytic
ﬁndings and substantially increases statistical power of a meta-analysis (Shadish et al., 2002 ;
Shadish et al., 2008 ).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 137
The methodology of the present meta-analytic study is in line with our recent three-level meta-
analysis (de Witte et al., 2020a ), in which 104 randomized controlled trials were included. Results
showed a signi ﬁcant small-to-medium eﬀ ect of music interventions on physiological stress-related
outcomes ( d= .380; 61 trials), and a medium eﬀ ect of music interventions on psychological
stress-related outcomes ( d= .545; 79 trials), indicating that groups receiving music intervention
beneﬁted more than the comparison groups. In the present meta-analysis, we examine the
overall eﬀ ect of music therapy on stress reduction, accounting for di ﬀerences in physiological and
psychological stress-related outcomes, and we aim to gain more insight into study, sample,
outcome and intervention characteristics that might moderate the e ﬀects of music therapy on
stress reduction.
Methods
Inclusion criteria
For the current meta-analysis, multiple inclusion criteria were formulated. First, only RandomizedControlled Trials (RCTs) and Clinical Controlled Trials (CCTs) that examined the e ﬀect of music
therapy on the experience of stress and/or state anxiety were included. The type of intervention con-cerned important inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Only studies that o ﬀered music therapy by
an educated and certi ﬁed music therapist were included in this meta-analysis. Outcome measures
related to quality of life (QoL) or pain were excluded, because in this study only the primaryoutcome measures of stress were included. The physiological e ﬀects of stress had to be measured
by heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure and hormone levels. The psychological
eﬀects of stress had to be measured by self-report instruments aiming at ‘stress ’or‘state anxiety’ .
Second, studies examining people with dementia or participants younger than 18 years of age
were excluded. Although many studies showed cognitive and emotional bene ﬁts in dementia
patients when they sing or listen to familiar songs (Särkämö et al., 2008 ,2014 ), these ﬁndings are
not directly related to ‘stress reduction ’. In addition, the stress measurement instruments which
are used in the included studies are not used in studies examining people with dementia or
young participants.
Selection of the studies
All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) available until the 8th of
May 2019 that met the inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analytic review. Multiple sys-tematic searches were performed with the help of an independent medical librarian, as librarian
engagement is signi ﬁcantly associated with higher quality of reported search strategies (Rethlefsen
et al., 2015 ). We conducted a computer-based search of the psychological and medical electronic
literature databases, including Medline, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, Web ofScience, Embase, Wiley Online Library, Springerlink, PubMed, PiCarta, Academic Search Premier,
ScienceDirect, PsycINfo and Google Scholar. The search string comprised three elements: a music
therapy element, a stress-related outcome element and a study design element. For the music
therapy element, the following keywords were used: ‘music therapy ’,‘musical therapy ’or‘music-
based therapy ’. For the stress-related outcome element, the following keywords were used:
‘stress ’,‘anxiety’ ,‘arousal ’,‘psychological stress,’‘ occupational stress ’,‘physiological stress ’,‘mental
suﬀer’,‘anguish ’,‘hypertension, ’‘relaxation ’,‘heart rate, ’‘blood pressure’ ,‘nervousness ’,‘cortical vig-
ilance ’,‘distress’ ,‘cortisol ’,‘intravascular pressure ’,‘vascular pressure’ or‘STAI’.
Concerning the study
design element, the keywords: ‘randomized controlled trial ’,‘randomised controlled trial ’,‘clinical
controlled trial ’,‘randomised ’,‘randomized ’,‘RCT’,‘review ’or‘meta-analysis ’were used. Further-
more, reference sections of review –and meta-analytic articles about the eﬀ ect of music (therapy)
interventions on stress-related outcomes were inspected for qualifying studies. The search protocol138 M. DE WITTE ET AL.
of this meta-analytic review is registered at the international prospective register of systematic
reviews (ref.no. CRD42020160222).
The initial search resulted in 2.182 individual studies and was conducted by an independent
librarian and the ﬁrst author. The ﬁrst selection on title and abstract resulted in 317 individual
studies that were, posteriorly, full text screened based on the inclusion criteria. Finally, 47 studies
met all the inclusion criteria (see Figure 1). All the steps of the selection process were conducted
by two di ﬀerent authors, who selected the studies blindly from each other. Concerning the selection
conﬂ icts, a third author was involved and made the ﬁnal decision. Table A1 provides an overview of
the included studies and their main characteristics (see Appendix 1).

Coding and moderators
The included studies were coded by the ﬁrst and second author using a coding sheet according to
the guidelines of Lipsey and Wilson ( 2001 ).Stress can be considered as the dependent variable and
was coded into physiological orpsychological stress-related outcomes, resulting in one meta-analysis.
Multiple variables with a potential moderating e ﬀect on the relation between music therapy and
stress were identi ﬁed. These moderators were divided into outcome-, study-, sample-, and interven-
tion characteristics.
Regarding the psychological stress-related outcomes, it was coded whether the psychological
outcomes were assessed by means of questionnaires measuring stress or (state) anxiety. State
anxiety can be seen as a psychological stress-related outcome, because many studies (e.g., de
Witte et al., 2020a ; Hook et al., 2008 ; Ng et al., 2016 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ) considered state anxiety
to be a result of stress and outcome measures related to state anxiety or stress. Therefore, in the lit-
erature these concepts are used interchangeably (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984 ; Ozer
et al., 2013 ; Pittman & Kridli, 2011 ; Wetsch et al., 2009 ). This is in line with the results of our previous
meta-analysis, which showed no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in eﬀ ect sizes between state-anxiety self-
report scales ( d= .553) and stress self-report scales ( d= .512). In the present study, 30% of the
studies used Visual Analog Scales (VAS) to measure perceived stress or state anxiety. Overall,
stress is often measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen et al., 1983 ), the Quick Mood
Scale (Woodruﬀ e-Peacock et al., 1998 ), and the Proﬁ le of Mood States (POMS) (McNair et al.,
1981 ), which instruments are used in 19% of the included studies. State anxiety is predominantly
measured by the state version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Spielberger
et al., 1983 ) and the anxiety version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), which
are used in 45% of the included studies.
Regarding the study characteristics, we coded the design, study quality, type of setting, type of
control condition and whether the study was conducted in Western- or non-Western countries.Studies with prospective group design, such as RCTs and CCTs were considered relevant for the
current research. Therefore, we coded study design as RCT when participants were allocated to treat-
ment conditions through randomization (e.g., computer-generated randomization lists), and CCTdesign when authors did not explicitly mention randomization, or quasi-randomized studies. The
quality of the study was coded as strong, moderate orweak after assessment with the ‘Quality Assess-
ment Tool for Quantitative Studies ’(Eﬀective Public Health Practice Project [EPHPP], 2009 ). This tool
measures the quality of a study by providing a comprehensive and structured assessment of studyquality (Armijo-Olivo et al., 2012 ). The EPHPP has been reported to have high content and construct
validity (Jackson & Waters, 2005 ; Thomas et al., 2004 ).
 Low quality studies negatively a ﬀect the
internal (causal conclusion) validity, which can lead to a biased estimation of the overall e ﬀect esti-
mate (Higgins & Green, 2011 ; Zeng et al., 2015 ).
Regarding the setting in which the study was conducted, we coded whether the study was con-
ducted in a mental healthcare setting or in a medical setting (e.g., during polyclinic treatments, before
or after surgery, palliative care). Furthermore, the type of control condition was coded, because
diﬀerent control conditions can yield di ﬀerent eﬀ ect sizes (Finney, 2000 ; Karlsson & Bergmark,
2015 ). We coded care as usual (CAU) when no stress-reducing intervention was o ﬀered, but patients
did receive regular care within medical or mental healthcare, waiting list when there was no care or
intervention oﬀ ered, or stress intervention when another stress-reducing intervention was delivered,
such as listening to prerecorded music, verbal support, or mindfulness-based therapy. Further, we
coded whether the study was conducted in Western countries (European countries, Australia, USA,
Canada, New Zealand) or whether the study was conducted in countries designated as non-
Western countries (mainly Asiatic countries). The cultural environment has been shown to
inﬂuence the way people respond to and cope with stress (Lonner, 2007 ; Tweed et al., 2004 ),
which could in ﬂuence the eﬀ ect of music on stress. In our previous meta-analysis, the country in
which the study was conducted just failed to reach the conventional level of statistical signi ﬁcance140 M. DE WITTE ET AL.
(p= 0.089), indicating that non-Western studies yielded larger e ﬀects on physiological stress-related
outcomes than studies conducted in Western countries.
Sample characteristics were also coded, such as the percentage of men in each study. There are
indications that men and women react di ﬀerently to stress, both psychologically and physiologically,
leading to substantiated gender di ﬀerences in measured stress levels (Galanakis et al., 2009 ; Kajantie
& Phillips, 2006 ; Verma et al., 2011 ). We also coded the average age of the participants per study,
because research on occupational stress revealed several di ﬀerences in stress levels between
diﬀerent age groups (Galanakis et al., 2009 ).
Additionally, we coded nine music therapy characteristics. First, we coded whether the music
therapy was oﬀ ered to an individual patient or whether it concerned a group music therapy.
Empirical evidence shows that during group music therapy interventions people synchronize
with each other, which evokes positive feelings of togetherness and bonding, and decreases
stress levels (Linnemann et al., 2016 ; Tarr et al., 2014 ). Second, we coded music therapy interven-
tions as ‘protocolized ’or‘non-protocolized’ . Music therapy protocols not only enable researchers to
compare and replicate studies, but also to understand consistencies and strategies used by musictherapists across sessions with participants (de Witte et al., 2020a ; Vink & Hanser, 2018 ). Both struc-
ture as well as strategies used during the therapy session may have impact on participants’ out-
comes, such as stress levels. Third, the quality of the intervention description was coded inreported detailed orreported brie ﬂy and poor . We considered the description of the therapy as
detailed if authors mentioned or elaborated on components of a session of music therapy, such
as the number or duration of the sessions, listening to live or recorded music, or which musical
instruments or music therapeutic techniques were used. If authors did not explicitly report on
most of the characteristics of the delivered music therapy (as mentioned above), the descriptionwas regarded as brief/poor.
Fourth, music style was divided into three categories: classical music o ﬀered by the music thera-
pist, relaxation music, and selection of own-preference music by patient. Fifth, we made a distinctionbetween the way the music was o ﬀered: whether the music therapist used live music alone, pre-
recorded music alone or both. Sixth, with regard to music selection, we coded whether the musicwas selected based on the preferences of the patient, on the choice of the music therapisthimself, or whether a pre-selected choice of music was o ﬀered. In some studies, in which the
eﬀects of music listening on stress-related outcomes was examined, it was advised to allow the sub-
jects to choose the music themselves, because this may have a greater stress reducing impact(Brannon & Fiest, 2007 ; Juslin et al., 2008 ). However, our previous meta-analytic review showed
that the term ‘self-selected music ’is used both in studies where the patient could bring her/his
own preference music and in studies where the patient had to choose from a pre-selected list ofmusic styles or songs (de Witte et al., 2020a ). Therefore, we coded as such in the present study.
Seventh, we coded whether the tempo of the music was 60– 90 bpm or whether the music had
another tempo. Tempo can be considered as one of the most signi ﬁcant moderators of music-related
arousal and relaxation eﬀ ects. In the previous meta-analytic review (de Witte et al., 2020a )
of the
eﬀects of music interventions on stress-related outcomes, larger e ﬀect sizes were found in music
with a tempo of 60– 90 bpm compared to music with another tempo. Music with a slow tempo,
such as meditative music, has often been demonstrated to initiate reductions in heart rate, resulting
in greater relaxation (e.g., Bernardi et al., 2005 ; Bringman et al., 2009 ; Chlan, 2000 ; Hilz et al., 2014 ;
Nomura et al., 2013 ). Lastly, we coded the number of music intervention sessions and the frequency
of the sessions per week. The number of interventions has been shown to be positively correlatedwith stress and anxiety regulation (Cassileth et al., 2003 ; Gold et al., 2009 ; Robb et al., 2011 ).
Calculation and analyses
The eﬀ ect sizes were transformed into Cohen ’sdby using the calculator of Wilson ( 2013 ) and for-
mulas of Lipsey and Wilson ( 2001 ). Negative eﬀ ect sizes indicate that music therapy had a negativeHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 141
eﬀect on stress-related outcomes. Most d-values were calculated based on reported means and stan-
dard deviations. To correct for pre-treatment di ﬀerences, pre-test e ﬀects were subtracted from post-
test eﬀects. The eﬀ ect size was coded as zero when a study reported that an e ﬀect was not signi ﬁcant
without providing any statistics (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ). For both meta-analyses, the continuous
moderators (age of the participants, gender of the participants, duration of the music intervention
and frequency of the music intervention) were centered on their means. For categorical variables,
dichotomous dummy variables were created. Extreme outliers in e ﬀect sizes were identi ﬁed using
box plots (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013 ), and were winsorized (i.e., replaced by the highest or lowest
acceptable score falling within the normal range) for both meta-analyses. Standard errors were esti-mated using formulas of Lipsey and Wilson ( 2001 ).
In some of the studies, it was possible to calculate more than one e ﬀect size, as most studies
reported on multiple stress-related outcome variables, multiple scales or measurement instru-ments. It is possible that the eﬀ ect sizes from the same study are more alike than e ﬀect
sizes from other studies. The assumption of independent e ﬀect sizes underlying traditional
meta-analytic methods was therefore violated (Hox, 2010 ; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ). We applied
a multilevel approach to meta-analysis in order to account for the interdependency of e ﬀect
sizes (see Assink et al., 2015 ; Cheung, 2014 ; de Witte et al., 2020a ; Houben et al., 2015 ;
Spruit et al., 2016 ).
A three-level meta-analytic model was used to calculate the combined e ﬀect sizes and to
perform the moderator analyses. Three sources of variance were modeled, including the sampling
variance for each e ﬀect sizes (level-one), the variance between e ﬀect sizes within studies (level-
two), and the variance between studies (level-three) (Assink & Wibbelink, 2016). The meta-analysis
was conducted in R (version 3.4.3) with the metafor-package, employing a multilevel randomeﬀects model (Houben et al., 2015; Van den Bussche et al., 2009; Viechtbauer, 2010 ). This
model is often used for multilevel meta-analyses and, in general, it is superior to the ﬁxed-
eﬀects approaches used in traditional meta-analyses (Van Den Noortgate & Onghena, 2003).
We used likelihood-ratio-tests to compare the deviance scores of the full model and the
models without variance parameters on level two or three to determine if the level-two and
-three variances were signi ﬁcant, indicating heterogeneity of e ﬀect sizes. A heterogeneous
eﬀe
ct size distribution indicates that the e ﬀect sizes cannot be treated as estimates of a
common overall e ﬀect size. In that case, we conducted moderator analyses, because the di ﬀer-
ences among eﬀ ect sizes may be explained by outcome, study, sample, and/or intervention
characteristics.
Publication bias
A common problem in conducting a meta-analysis is that studies with non-signi ﬁcant or negative
results are less likely to be published than studies with positive and signi ﬁcant results. The studies
included in this meta-analysis may therefore not be an adequate representation of all studies that
have been conducted, which is called the ‘ﬁle drawer problem ’(Rosenthal, 1995 ).
In order to check the presence of publication bias in the current meta-analysis, a trim and ﬁll
procedure was performed (Duval & Tweedie, 2000a ,2000b ). In case of publication bias, the
funnel plot of the distribution of eﬀ ect sizes is asymmetric. We tested if eﬀ ect sizes were
missing on the left and right side of the distribution. Publication bias would only be likely to
occur in case of non-signiﬁ cant or unfavorable (i.e., negative) results, resulting in left-sided
funnel plot asymmetry. Right-sided funnel plot asymmetry is indicative of selection bias. Weimputed estimations of eﬀ ect sizes of missing studies through trim and ﬁll analyses in the case
of left or right-sided asymmetry, and subsequently computed an overall e ﬀect size that would
take the in ﬂuence of publication bias or selection bias into account (Duval & Tweedie, 2000a ,
2000b ), providing an estimate of the degree to which publication bias or selection bias might
have a ﬀected the overall mean eﬀ ect size.142 M. DE WITTE ET AL.
Results
Overall e ﬀect of music therapy on stress-related outcomes
The present meta-analytic review on the eﬀ ects of music therapy on both physiological and psycho-
logical stress-related outcomes, included 47 independent studies ( s), reporting on 76 eﬀ ect sizes ( k),
and a total sample of N= 2.747 subjects, of which n=1.405 subjects in the music therapy groups,
and n=1.342 subjects in the comparison groups. Table A1 (see Appendix 1) shows an overview of
the most important characteristics of the included studies. Table 1 shows the overall e ﬀect of music
therapy on both physiological stress-related outcomes and psychological stress-related outcomes.
We found a signi ﬁcant medium-to-strong eﬀ ect ( d= .723, [.51 –.94]) of music therapy on stress-
related outcomes in mental healthcare and medical settings.
According to the trim-and- ﬁll plot, the presence of publication bias was unlikely (see Figure A1 ,
Appendix 2 ), because studies were lacking on the right side of the funnel instead of the left side of
the funnel. A trim and ﬁll analysis yielded a marginally larger eﬀ ect size of d= .783 compared to the
observed eﬀ ect size of d= .723. The likelihood ratio test showed that signi ﬁcant variance was present
at the between-study level (level 3) and the within study level (level 2). We therefore conducted
moderator analyses on type of outcome, study, sample, and music intervention characteristics toexamine the eﬀ ect of music intervention on physiological stress-related outcomes. The results are
presented in Table 2.

Results of moderator analyses of music therapy on stress-related outcomes
Outcome characteristics. Both the domain of outcomes (physiological or psychological stress-
related outcomes) and the type psychological measure (stress or state-anxiety measurements) did
not in ﬂuence the e ﬀects of music therapy on stress-related outcomes.
Study characteristics. Firstly, the strongest eﬀ ects of music therapy on stress-related outcomes
were measured by CCTs ( d= 1.449, [1.01 –1.89]) compared to RCTs ( d=.555, [.35 –.76]). Secondly, the
continent in which the study was conducted did also moderate the overall e ﬀect. Studies from non-
Western countries had a stronger in ﬂuence on the overall e ﬀect of music therapy on stress-related
outcomes ( d=1.306, [.79 –1.82]) compared to studies from Western countries ( d= .611, [.39 –.83]).
Thirdly, a signi ﬁcant moderating eﬀ ect was found for type of control condition. Studies with a
waiting list control condition yielded a larger eﬀ ect ( d= 1.415, [.95 –1.88]) than studies with CAU
(d= .561, [.33 –.79]) or another stress-reducing intervention ( d= .594, [.29 –.90]). The clinical
setting in which the study was conducted, did not moderate the e ﬀect. No signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences
were found between the eﬀ ects of music therapy on stress-related outcomes in mental health
care settings and medical settings. Furthermore, we observed that study quality moderated theTable 2. Continued.

overall eﬀ ect with low quality studies ( d= 1.056, [.71 –1.40]) yielding larger eﬀ ects compared to
studies with a moderate ( d= .589, [.28 –.90]) or strong ( d= .444, [.02 –.87]) study quality.
Sample characteristics. The age ( d= .718, [.50 –.94]) and gender ( d= .728, [.51 –.94]) of the
samples did not show to have a moderating eﬀ ect on stress symptoms.
Intervention characteristics. Music tempo between 60 and 90 bpm yielded a larger eﬀ ect ( d=
.900 [.54 –1.26]) compared to music with no speciﬁ c tempo ( d= .631 [.37 –.90]). Similarly, more than
one session of music therapy had a larger eﬀ ect ( d= .894 [.56 –1.23]) than one session ( d= .594 [.17 –
1.02]). The eﬀ ect size of preselected choice was larger ( d= 1.059 [.66 –1.46]) than music selection by
the music therapist ( d= .695 [.37 –1.02]) and by the patient ( d= .766 [.47 –1.06]). With respect to music
style, relaxation had a greater eﬀ ect (d= .826 [.49 –1.16]) compared to own preference music ( d= .688
[.40–.97]) and classical music ( d= .562 [ −.07 to 1.19]). Additionally, group music therapy yielded a
larger eﬀ ect ( d= .927 [.54 –1.32]) than individual music therapy ( d= .679 [.41 –.95]). However, due
to the small number of studies in certain categories (see Table 2 ), these di ﬀerences were not statisti-
cally signi ﬁcant, and further studies are necessary to estimate these di ﬀerences with more precision.
Other di ﬀerences had similar eﬀ ect sizes (e.g., treatment protocol ( d= .683 [.33 –1.04]) or not ( d= .747
[.48–1.02]); detailed intervention description ( d= .775 [.52 –1.03]) or brief/poor description ( d= .637
[.31–96]); and the way the music therapist induced the music –live music ( d= .726 [.46 –.99]), pre-
recorded music ( d= .664 [.26 –1.07]) and both ( d= .767 [.37 –1.16]). Lastly, the eﬀ ect of frequency
of sessions per week ( d= .746 [.49 –1.01]) was not signi ﬁcant.
Discussion
Overall e ﬀects
Overall, we found a signi ﬁcant medium-to-strong eﬀect ( d= 0.723, [0.51, 0.94]) of music therapy on
stress-related outcomes, indicating that participants receiving music therapy bene ﬁted more than con-
trols. We conclude that music therapy is e ﬀective in reducing stress-related symptoms in both mental
healthcare and medical settings. In our previous meta-analytic review, we found positive small-to-
medium eﬀects of music interventions on stress-related outcomes (see for more details: de Witte
et al., 2020a ), while the ﬁndings of the present study demonstrate that music therapy yields a
medium-to-strong eﬀect on stress reduction. The di ﬀerence in the strength of overall e ﬀect sizes
may be explained by the di ﬀerent way both types of interventions are o ﬀered. The active involvement
of a music therapist who is speci ﬁcally trained to tailor interventions to the needs of patients and their
musical preferences might give a reasonable explanation for the larger e ﬀect size for music therapy
compared to music interventions (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ;D i l e o , 1999 ,2006 ;M a g e e , 2019 ; Magee et al.,
2017 ; Stegemann et al., 2019 ). Music therapists are especially trained to deliver music therapy sessions
to meet participants/patients ’needs at the individual or group level (Ra ﬁeyan & Ries, 2007 ).
The overall ﬁndings of the present meta-analysis are consistent with the ﬁndings of previous
reviews and/or meta-analyses on the eﬀ ects of music therapy on stress- and anxiety-related out-
comes (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Bradt et al., 2013a ; Bradt et al., 2013b ; Bradt et al., 2016 ; Carr et al.,
2013 ; de Witte et al., 2020a ; Gold et al., 2009 ; Kamioka et al., 2014 ). In addition, the promising
results of music therapy established in the current meta-analysis are in line with the ﬁndings of pre-
vious systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the e ﬀects of music interventions on the reduction of
stress and/or (state) anxiety (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Bradt et al., 2013a ; Bradt et al., 2013b ; Bradt et al.,
2016 ; de Witte et al., 2020a ; Gillen et al., 2008 ; Kim et al., 2015 ; Pelletier, 2004 ; Rudin et al., 2007 ).
Both the present meta-analysis and previous reviews show a growth in controlled clinical studies
testing the eﬀ ects of music therapy and/or music interventions on stress-related outcomes, which is
important in order to formulate valid conclusions on the e ﬀects of non-pharmaceutical interventions
for stress reduction (Casey, 2017 ; de Witte et al., 2020a ). The demand for more non-pharmaceutical
interventions, such as music therapy, may be explained by the increasing awareness of the negative
side eﬀ ects of tranquilizing medication, such as substance dependence and abuse (Casey, 2017 ;HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 145
World Health Organization [WHO], 2010 ). Although a considerable number of people around the
world use tranquilizing medications to cope with daily life stressors or anxiety (e.g., Bandelow
et al., 2015 ; Olfson et al., 2015 ; Puetz et al., 2015 ), previous studies show no convincing evidence
for the short-term eﬀ ectiveness of pharmacological treatment in the reduction of stress-related pro-
blems (Donovan et al., 2019 ; Olfson et al., 2015 ).
Eﬀect moderating variables
Results of the present meta-analysis indicate that moderators explain diﬀ erences in the strength of
the eﬀ ect size. Signi ﬁcant larger eﬀ ects were found for studies using quasi-experimental CCTs com-
pared to RCTs. Regardless of ethical concerns about the randomization of patients, the results ofRCTs are still considered to provide the most robust evidence, because RCT designs can better
exclude alternative explanations for established intervention e ﬀects than non-randomized
designs. Selection bias in non-randomized e ﬀect studies can lead to overestimations of treatment
eﬀects (Page et al., 2018 ; Valentine & Thompson, 2013 ). In addition, we also found a signi ﬁcant mod-
erating eﬀ ect on the type of control condition: comparisons with a waiting list control group showed
larger eﬀ ects than comparisons with CAU or another stress-reducing intervention. This ﬁnding is in
line with our expectation that CAU or another intervention would lead to reduction of stress, andthus to more stress reduction compared to a waiting list group. In addition, participants on a
waiting list may also show a reduction in the stress level of symptomatology, which is shown in pre-vious research in psychiatric populations (Arrindell, 2001 ; Haeyen et al., 2018 ). Speci ﬁcally, Crawford
et al. ( 2013 ) found that in spite of the positive scores of subjects of the music therapy group on stress
reduction compared to subjects of the wait-list control group, the control participants also showedan improvement on stress reduction compared to baseline.
The overall eﬀ ect size proved to be strongly moderated by the country in which the study was
conducted (i.e., non-Western versus Western countries). Larger e ﬀects were found in non-Western
studies ( n= 8), including studies conducted in Asian countries, such as China, Korea, and Taiwan,
but also studies conducted in Iran, Brazil and Nigeria. It has been shown that the cultural environ-ment in ﬂuences how people respond to stress (Lonner, 2007 ; Tweed et al., 2004 ), which might
explain di ﬀerences between Western and non-Western countries. On the other hand, the non-
Western countries show great heterogeneity in culture, socioeconomic characteristics or topographi-cal region. Moreover, Western countries with large proportions of immigrants –such as the USA,
Canada, and Australia –make it di ﬃcult to equate country with culture (Morales & Ladhari, 2011 ).
Additionally, post-hoc analyses showed a weak correlation between Non-Western countries andstudy design ( r= .34 ,p= <.01 ), which indicates that the CCT design was more frequently used in
Non-Western countries than in Western studies .Further research is needed to test particular expla-
nations for cultural di ﬀerences in eﬀ ects between studies in Western and non-Western countries. Not
only culture should be taken into account in future research, but also socioeconomic characteristicsof study samples and the delivery of care in di ﬀerent health care systems, because of great hetero-
geneity both within and between countries.
Contrary to our expectations, we did not ﬁnd evidence for a moderating e ﬀect
of studies using a
speciﬁ c therapy protocol compared to studies without such a protocol. This can be explained by the
fact that most studies included in our meta-analysis did not report on the use of such a therapy pro-tocol, but still showed an adequate and rich description of the content of music therapy interven-tions. From the perspective of the music therapist, who is trained to tune in to the patient by
adjusting the way of music-making as an immediate response to the patient ’s needs (Aalbers
et al., 2019 ; Magee, 2019 ), music therapy protocols might often equal the ﬂexibility of non-proto-
colled treatment in order to deliver personalized treatment, which increases the comparability orsameness of protocolled and non-protocolled treatment.
Notwithstanding we believe that there is a need for developing music therapy protocols and
intervention descriptions that facilitate further replication of music therapy interventions and,146 M. DE WITTE ET AL.
subsequently, will better inform clinicians and practitioners in both mental health care and medical
settings (de Witte et al., 2020a ). In addition, in future trials we strongly recommend examining treat-
ment integrity as well, because music therapists may choose not to o ﬀer some of the elements
speciﬁ ed in the protocol or to add new treatment elements. Having information on treatment integ-
rity allows for the examination of the degree to which the implemented intervention approximatesthe intended intervention, and possible eﬀ ects of treatment integrity on client outcomes (Pere-
pletchikova, 2011 ; Vermilyea et al., 1984 ).
Study quality just failed to reach the conventional level of statistical signi ﬁcance, which indicates
that low quality studies may yield larger e ﬀects compared to studies with a moderate or strong study
quality. An explanation for this result could be that the degree of ‘masking ’was an important factor
in assessing study quality. Masking of participants in music therapy studies is usually not possibleunless two types of music therapy interventions are compared, such as receptive music therapy
versus active music therapy (Bradt et al., 2013b ). Masking procedures in which only the investigator
is masked to the allocation of the intervention is much more feasible in music therapy trials (Day &
Altman, 2000 ). Nevertheless, the present meta-analysis contained several studies in which the way of
masking was not reported at all ( n= 12), which is in line with the ﬁndings of Magee et al. ( 2017 ), who
conclude in their Cochrane review that in future research reporting on the masking of participantsand outcome assessors requires improvement. The lack of participant masking is problematic when
studies examine subjective outcomes, such as mood or quality of life. Masking of therapists is often
not possible in music therapy studies when active music-making is examined. When due to settingconstrains the interventions cannot assure masking procedures, they should at least be masked to
the purpose of the study where possible. In either case, masking procedures should be reported or
discussed (Bradt et al., 2013b ; Magee et al., 2017 ).
Statistical analyses showed that the selected music therapy characteristics do not seem to mod-
erate the overall eﬀ ects of music therapy on stress-related outcomes. This could be explained by the
diversity of the music therapeutic approaches and/or the applied interventions of the included musictherapy studies, which is also mentioned in several previous reviews (Carr et al., 2013 ; Gold et al.,
2009 ; Mössler et al., 2011 ; Silverman, 2003 ). On the other hand, this diversity in the content of
music therapy can also be related to the core competence of a quali ﬁed music therapist, which
means that the interventions are often tailored to what the patient needs or shows at that
moment. Precisely this aspect of music therapy is the main di ﬀerence with music interventions
without a music therapist and could therefore have resulted in a larger e ﬀect size.
The selected intervention characteristics did not have a statistically signi ﬁcant impact on the
eﬀectiveness of music therapy. However, some substantial di ﬀerences in eﬀ ect sizes were found
(d= .30 or larger) in moderator analyses that did not reach the conventional level of signi ﬁcance
due to lack of statistical power, mostly caused by an unequal distribution of studies (and e ﬀect
sizes) among moderator categories (see Table 2). We discuss some of these ﬁndings because they
may be of particular theoretical interest, and probably should be addressed in future research.
First, there was a di ﬀerence of d=
 .30 between the impact of only one session of music therapy ( d
=.594, [.17 –1.02]) and more than one session ( d=.894, [.56 –1.23]), indicating that the eﬀ ect of music
therapy on stress-related outcomes increases with the use of multiple sessions. The larger e ﬀect size
for more than one session is in line with the study of Gold et al. ( 2009 ), which showed more substan-
tial bene ﬁts in patients who took a longer course of music therapy or more frequent sessions.
However, Gold ’s study examined the eﬀ ects of music therapy in patients with severe mental dis-
orders, whereas the present meta-analysis mostly included studies with patients suﬀ ering from
much milder mental problems or patients with stress due to medical conditions. This does not dimin-
ish the importance of stress reduction, since stress is globally recognized as a major risk factor for thedevelopment of serious health problems (American Psychological Association [APA], 2017 ; Australian
Psychological Society [APS], 2015 ).
Notably, the e ﬀect of the number of sessions seems to be related to the type of setting (medical
healthcare versus mental healthcare). In our meta-analysis, only studies conducted in medicalHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 147
healthcare settings measured one-session e ﬀects of music therapy on stress-related outcomes,
which of course does not exclude the possibility that positive e ﬀects can just as well be measured
within mental healthcare settings after only one session of music therapy. Nevertheless, our meta-
analysis found empirical evidence for the short-term e ﬀectiveness of music therapy (i.e., a single
session of music therapy) in reducing stress, and therefore puts the assumption that pharmacological
treatment should be started due to its immediate and rapid e ﬀect in a critical light (Bandelow et al.,
2015 ; de Witte et al., 2020a ; Fedoro ﬀ& Taylor, 2001 ). Moreover, the shown eﬃ cacy of only one single
session may facilitate the implementation of music therapy in cases where for logistic reasons or inmore complicated settings (e.g., during chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer, before or after
surgery, or in palliative care) multiple sessions of music therapy would not be possible.
Second, the large eﬀ ect of music with a tempo of 60– 90 bpm ( d=.900, n=16) is worth mention-
ing. It is larger than the eﬀ ect obtained in our previous meta-analytic review (de Witte et al., 2020a ),
showing a medium eﬀ ect ( d=.625, n=36). The larger eﬀ ect size found in the current meta-analysis
may be ascribed to a lower amount of studies using prerecorded music than in our previous meta-
analysis, which included mostly ‘music medicine ’interventions. Interestingly, a post-hoc analysis
showed a signi ﬁcant strong correlation between music tempo of 60– 90 bpm and prerecorded
music ( r= .61, p= <.01). Unfortunately, several studies did not report on the tempo used due to
the fact that (1) interventions could vary across the music therapy session depending on participants’
needs, and (2) the use of musical instruments varied considerably within and across the music
therapy sessions. Moreover, the music tempo is usually not measured during a music therapysession of live improvised music are. We strongly recommend to investigate the in ﬂuence of
music tempo as a component of music therapy interventions, especially when targeting stressreduction. Moreover, literature also shows that music with a slow tempo and steady rhythm mayprovide stress reduction by altering inherent body rhythms, such as heart rate (Thaut et al., 1999 ;
Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014 ).
Lastly, the moderator ‘therapy setting ’revealed a large eﬀ ect for group music therapy ( d= .927,
[.54–1.32]). There is empirical evidence showing that group music activities stimulate the release of
the stress-reducing neurotransmitters endorphin and oxytocin as a result of positive feelings oftogetherness and bonding among group members (Linnemann et al., 2016 ; Tarr et al., 2014 ). In
group music therapy, feelings of togetherness and bonding may be the result of non-verbal synchro-
nization with each other by making music or listening to music, which o ﬀers a di ﬀerent experience of
communicating and relating to others in a medium that has been shown to be motivating for people
who otherwise ﬁnd
 it diﬃcult to share or engage (Carr et al., 2017 ; Gold et al., 2013 ; Stern, 2010 ).
Moreover, research shows that achieving synchronization by musical attunement is considered
one of the most important (pre-)conditions in music therapy for eventually reaching stress reduction(Aalbers et al., 2019 ; de Witte et al., 2020b ). Facilitating synchronization as the basis for further inter-
ventions in music therapy is therefore regarded as one of the key competencies of a music therapist(e.g., Aalbers et al., 2019 ; Bruscia, 1987 ; Schumacher & Calvet, 2008 ; Wheeler, 2015 ). Finally, a post-
hoc analysis showed a signi ﬁcant moderate correlation ( r=.45,p=<.01) between individual music
therapy and medical settings, which indicates that individual music therapy is relatively more used inmedical setting compared other settings.
Limitations of the present study
The current study has some limitations that need to be mentioned. Firstly, a signi ﬁcant number ( n=
16) of the studies included in this meta-analysis had a small sample size (10 –25 participants). Studies
with small sample sizes are fairly common in meta-analyses (Davey et al., 2011 ), particularly when
studies are conducted in medical or palliative settings where time and logistic constraints occur.
It is important to highlight that small sample sizes in primary studies may result in great heterogen-
eity in treatment eﬀ ects due to relatively large standard errors. Studies with small samples may also
show greater clinical heterogeneity among patients compared to studies with large sample sizes,148 M. DE WITTE ET AL.
which may a ﬀect the outcome of the experimental treatment (IntHout et al., 2015 ; Schwarzer et al.,
2015 ). Furthermore, the ﬁndings from small sample size studies tend to be less generalizable com-
pared to studies with large number of participants. Furthermore, a limitation of any meta-analysis is
that there is not a completely satisfactory way to test the presence of publication bias (Carter et al.,
2019 ). The presence of publication bias can therefore never be ruled out, even if formal tests indicate
that publication bias is unlikely. In fact, it is imperative that all clinical trials be preregistered in e ﬀec-
tiveness research, including publication of the research protocols. In the present study, we chose toconduct a funnel-plot-based trim and ﬁll method (Duval & Tweedie, 2000a ,2000b ), which is com-
monly used in three-level meta-analyses in the domain of psychological studies (see Assink et al.,
2019 ; Assink & Wibbelink, 2016 ; Zeegers et al., 2017 ), which seems a su ﬃciently sensitive method
to detect publication bias in the current meta-analysis given the substantial number of studies
and eﬀ ect sizes, the magnitude of the eﬀ ect sizes, and the degree of level 2 (within studies) and
level 3 (between studies) heterogeneity of the overall e ﬀect size (See Assink & Wibbelink, 2016 ;
Carter et al., 2019 ).
Although a clear search strategy to identify relevant studies has been performed, by for instance
excluding observational and retrospective studies, most studies included in our meta-analysis lackmasking procedure to participants. This particularly occurred in medical settings where due to theclinical condition of the participants the treatment group was disclosed. The majority of studies with
small sample sizes and without a masking procedure were conducted in medical care. This might
have in ﬂuenced some of the study outcomes. Speci ﬁcally, the lack of masking may have contributed
to therapist expectancy (leading to therapist bias) and/or a patient expectancy-e ﬀect (also known as
placebo e ﬀect), eliciting a desirable therapeutic outcome (Tambling, 2012). In future studies, e ﬀorts
need to be made to reduce expectancy or placebo e ﬀects, for example, by measuring expectation
and/or adopting alternative experimental designs to control for these e ﬀects (Atwood et al., 2020;
Boot et al., 2013). Notwithstanding the ethical reasons to refrain from a masking procedure and
waiting-list design in anxiety and stress studies, it is important to further improve study qualityand use larger samples. Next, we strongly recommend that future trials report on power analyses.
Concluding remarks
The current meta-analytic review provides evidence that music therapy can be eﬀ ective in reducing
stress and provides justi ﬁcations for the increasing use of music therapy carried out by a quali ﬁed
music therapist in both mental health care practice and medical settings. Given the added valueof the presence of a well-trained and quali ﬁed music therapist who oﬀ ers music therapy, it is advisa-
ble to carefully consider whether music therapy is needed, or whether music listening interventions,mostly oﬀ ered by healthcare professionals, are su ﬃcient. In addition, low costs and lack of side e ﬀects
of music therapy, and the moderate-to-strong stress-relieving e ﬀects of music therapy are very
important for the prevention and treatment of stress-related problems. Nevertheless, with respectto the methodology of future trials, we strongly recommend reducing the risk of selection bias byaligning with the conditions of RCTs. Finally, the development of standardized music therapy proto-
cols is necessary to conduct more robust research on the e ﬀects of music therapy, and to gain more
insight into the moderating eﬀ ects of characteristics of music therapy for stress reduction.
