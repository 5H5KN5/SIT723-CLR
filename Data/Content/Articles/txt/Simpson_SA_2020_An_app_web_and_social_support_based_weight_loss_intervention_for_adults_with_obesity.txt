Abstract
Background: Social support has an important role in successful weight loss. The aim of this study was to assess the
feasibility and acceptability of an app-, web- and social support-based intervention in supporting adults with
obesity to achieve weight loss.
Methods: The intervention and evaluation methods were tested in a feasibility randomised controlled trial. Adults
in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area of Scotland with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m2were recruited
and randomised 2:1 (intervention to control). The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methods
were assessed against pre-specified progression criteria, via process, economic and outcome evaluation. Three
primary outcomes were explored: BMI, diet and physical activity, as well as a number of secondary outcomes. The
intervention group had access to the HelpMeDoIt! intervention for 12 months. This encouraged them to (i) set
goals, (ii) monitor progress and (iii) harness social support by inviting ‘helpers ’from their existing social network.
The control group received a healthy lifestyle leaflet.
Results: One hundred and nine participants were recruited, with 84 participants (77%) followed-up at 12 months.
The intervention and trial methods were feasible and acceptable. Participants and helpers were generally positive.
Of the 54 (74%) participants who downloaded the app, 48 (89%) used it. Interview data indicated that HelpMeDoIt!
promoted social support from existing social networks to support weight loss. This support was often given outside
of the app.
Outcomes were compared using linear regression models, with randomised group, the baseline measurement of
the outcome, age and gender as predictor variables. These analyses were exploratory and underpowered to detect
effects. However, all pre-specified primary outcome effects (BMI, diet and physical activity) had wide confidence
intervals and were therefore consistent with clinically relevant benefits. Objective physical activity measures perhaps

Background
Poor diet, physical inactivity and high body mass index
(BMI) have been highlighted in the top 10 risk factors
for global burden of disease [ 1]. Preventive interventions
which are engaging and can reach large numbers of
people, including the underserved, are needed. Digital
technologies have significant potential for engaging
people with health behaviour change. Recent reports
show that most adults in the UK, including those in so-
cially disadvantaged groups, own a smartphone [ 2,3].
The role of social support from family and friends is
known to be important for successful weight loss and
maintenance [ 4,5]. Family and friends are significant
social influences on health behaviours due to factors
such as intimacy, influence and proximity to day-to-day
health behaviours. They are likely to be especiallyimportant at times of potential relapse. Many apps and
websites have chat forums or communities of support
from fellow users. There are also apps that can help
connect a user with family members or friends to share
stats on step count, exercise sessions, or other competi-
tive endeavours. However, none of these apps are specif-
ically designed to get users to engage with those closest
to them to help support them in losing weight by check-
ing on their progress and providing encouragement.
This is despite existing evidence indicating the positive
role of family and friends in promoting effective
behaviour change rather than anonymous online
contacts [ 6,7]. As far as we were aware none of these
sites or apps offered the combination of elements that
we used in HelpMeDoIt!, most importantly user-
nominated social support from key individuals within
that person ’s social network, i.e. existing friends and
family who will in many cases be the people that partici-
pants eat and exercise with.
There is also strong evidence for goal setting and self-
monitoring as successful behaviour change techniques
[8–10]. These techniques derive from social cognitive
theory [ 11] and control theory [ 12], the key psycho-
logical theories which inform the HelpMeDoIt! interven-
tion, alongside social support theories. Combining social
support with these techniques, using accessible, engaging
technology, has the potential to impact behaviour
change at a population level for low cost [ 13,14]. If brief
engagement with an app could mobilise existing social
connections to support longer term change, then this
could offer a sustainable approach to weight loss and
maintenance. The main aim of the study is to explore
the feasibility, acceptability and impact of a weight loss
intervention, delivered via smartphone app and website,
in supporting adults with obesity to achieve weight loss
goals, and further to identify the value and optimal
design of a future effectiveness trial.

Methods
Design
The study was completed in two stages: intervention
development and early testing (stage 1) and a feasibility
randomised controlled trial (stage 2).
Stage 1
Over a 12-month period, we developed and piloted the
intervention. The intervention was developed iteratively
with involvement of a panel of user representatives ( n=
10) and a user testing group ( n= 28), who were
recruited via advertising in local organisations, Gumtree,
Twitter and Facebook. We purposively recruited a varied
group in terms of age, gender, socioeconomic status and
experience of using apps. All participants wanted to lose
weight. Working closely with these groups, we consid-
ered how to promote engagement as well as increase the
acceptability and functionality of the app and website.
This early intervention development work is detailed in
our full monograph [ 15]. We followed the UK Medical
Research Council (MRC) guidance [ 16] and the 6SQUID
[17] steps and adopted a person-centred approach [ 18].
At the end of the development process, we produced an
updated programme theory and logic model [ 15] (Fig. 1
shows the final logic model from the end of the stage 2).
Logic model components were directly linked to the app
and website components [ 19], e.g. to boost motivation
participants could see progress graphs, they could
receive in-app medals and trophies for progress and
most importantly encouragement from their helpers.Stage 2
Stage two was a feasibility RCT, with a process evalu-
ation and health economic component, which aimed to
examine feasibility, acceptability and trial parameters for
a future trial.
Participants
Participants in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health
Board area of Scotland were eligible if they were aged
18–70, had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2,
owned a smartphone and were interested in losing
weight. The study had several exclusion criteria listed
below:
–Terminal illness
–Previous bariatric surgery
–Dementia
–Pregnancy
–Low competence in English (inability to complete
study materials)
–Contraindications to physical activity
–Participant in stage 1 intervention development
–Being a nominated helper in the trial
Sample size
This was a feasibility study and thus the main focus was
to assess the acceptability of the intervention, the feasi-
bility of the evaluation methods and to estimate parame-
ters for a larger study. We intended to recruit 120
participants and estimated a dropout rate of 30%. The
final sample size of 84 for analysis was not powered to
detect differences between groups for the proposed
effectiveness outcomes (BMI, physical activity and diet).
However, it allowed estimation of any feasibility propor-
tion (e.g. proportions retained/found the study accept-
able/provided outcome data) across the whole sample
with a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 11 per-
centage points. This would also allow for the estimation
of the mean of a continuous outcome (such as BMI) in
the intervention arm with a 95% confidence interval of
0.262 of a standard deviation.
Recruitment and randomisation
We recruited participants in the Greater Glasgow and
Clyde Health Board area of Scotland between April and
October of 2016 from three sources: primary care
(searched primary care databases and sent letters to
potentially eligible patients), online (e.g. Gumtree,
Facebook and Twitter) and community settings (e.g. ad-
vertised via local press, slimming clubs, weight manage-
ment clinics, study posters in community locations) [ 19].
Participants were screened for eligibility and a face-to-
face appointment was arranged for consent and baseline
data collection with a field worker. Since we were mostSimpson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:133 Page 3 of 14
interested in the acceptability of the intervention and to
improve trial efficiency, we randomised participants
using a 2:1 ratio planning for 80 participants in the
intervention group and 40 in the control group. Partici-
pants were allocated using a mixed randomisation/mini-
misation algorithm to ensure balance with respect to
gender and BMI (< 40, ≥40 kg/m2).
Interventions
The intervention group were given access to the
HelpMeDoIt! app and website for 12 months. The
website provided evidence-based information on weight
loss, setting and monitoring goals, as well as advice on
harnessing social support from family and/or friends.
The app allowed participants to (i) set goals for weight
loss, (ii) monitor progress and (iii) invite one or more
helpers from their existing social network. This is the
key novelty of this intervention whereby the app aimed
to mobilise social support from people in participants ’
close social networks who are likely to have greater and
sustained influence than, for example, those in online
networks or weight loss groups. Helpers who agreed to
provide support were also able to access the website and
app and see participants ’goals and progress. They couldprovide support to the participant via the app and
outside of the app (e.g. face-to-face, phone call). Further
details of the intervention can be found in our published
protocol paper [ 19]. The control group received a leaflet
on healthy lifestyle and were offered access to the app
and website after follow-up was complete. All partici-
pants were advised that they could continue to access
other sources of lifestyle change/support such as attend-
ing weight loss groups and fitness classes.
Outcomes
The key outcome of the study was whether pre-specified
progression criteria were met in order to progress to a
definitive trial. Feasibility and acceptability of the inter-
vention and evaluation methods were assessed using the
progression criteria outlined in Table 1[15]. These
criteria were approved by the Trial Steering Committee
prior to Stage 2. Data were collected at baseline and 12
months and included (i) quantitative outcomes assessing
three primary outcomes (BMI, physical activity and diet);
(ii) secondary outcomes of weight, waist and hip circum-
ference, social support, self-efficacy, motivation, mental
health and health-related quality of life; (iii) qualitative
interviews with participants and helpers at 6 and 12

months; (iv) health economic evaluation including meas-
urement and valuation of NHS resource use, participant-
borne costs, intervention costs and health-related quality
of life and capability wellbeing. The feasibility measures
and exploratory outcome measures used are detailed in
Table 2. Three primary outcomes were assessed for use
in a future effectiveness trial: body mass index (BMI),
physical activity and diet. We explored which of these
was most feasible by assessing acceptability and data
completeness. Since measuring diet [ 34] and physical
activity [ 35] in community-based trials is challenging, we
assessed two ways of measuring these outcomes: the
DINE questionnaire [ 21] and 24-h dietary recall [ 36] for
measuring diet and accelerometer [ 22] and 7-day
physical activity recall [ 37] for measuring physical
activity (see published protocol for details) [ 19].
Assessment of harms
We developed a standardized operating procedure for
dealing with any reported adverse events, advised partic-
ipants to discuss any health concerns with their GP and
encouraged participants and fieldworkers to report
negative outcomes to the study team. In addition, as part
of the qualitative interviews, we explored the issue of
‘harm ’. The intervention was low risk to participants.
Process evaluation
The process evaluation focussed on issues related to the
intervention including; context, fidelity, exposure, reach
and the programme theory and logic model. Both quan-
titative (app and web usage statistics) and qualitativedata (interviews) informed the process evaluation. At 6
months, we planned to interview up to 30 participants
and 20 helpers and at 12 months up to 20 participants.
Participants were purposively sampled to include
variation in level of app/website use, age and gender.
Semi-structured interview guides were used to explore
participant insights related to acceptability of the out-
come measures, acceptability and usability of the app
and website, impact of the intervention on behaviour,
support received from helpers and barriers to use [ 19].
Helper interviews focussed on intervention acceptability,
the guidance provided for being a helper, types of
support provided to their friend, challenges and changes
in their own health behaviour as a result of being a
helper. We also asked study participants about the
acceptability of the outcome measures and potential
contamination. Interviews were audio recorded and tran-
scribed verbatim.
Economic evaluation
The following resource use items were collected: (i)
intervention costs (fixed, variable and likely future an-
nual estimates), (ii) primary care services provided in the
NHS (e.g. GP visits, practice nurse), (iii) secondary care
services provided in the NHS (e.g. A&E attendances,
hospital stay) and (iv) personal costs (e.g. household in-
come spent on food, drinks and lifestyle activities).
Medication use at baseline and follow-up was also re-
corded. Mean group costs were calculated by attaching
the unit costs to frequency of resource use per group
participant [ 38]. Median and ranges for resource useTable 1 Progression criteria from feasibility to full randomised controlled trial [ 15]
Progression criterion Method of assessment
1.Are appropriate and effective routes of recruitment available to achieve a
powered sample size in a full trial?−Coming close to the sample size, as judged by the Trial Steering
Committee, with reasonable expectations of being able to address any
recruitment issues
2.Are participants willing to be randomised to the intervention? −Recruitment experiences of the study team and fieldworkers
−Insight from qualitative interviews with participants
3.Are appropriate retention rates achieved at 12-month follow-up? −Measured using the following scale in both the intervention and
control group at 12-months: If ≥70% followed-up proceed; if 50 –69%
followed-up discuss with Trial Steering Committee; if ≤49% followed-up
do not proceed
4.Is the intervention feasible to deliver and acceptable to participants and
their helpers?−USE questionnaire

the app at least twice OR do 25% of participants randomised use it three or
more times?−App usage statistics
6.Are identified barriers and challenges to implementation of the
intervention planned for and surmountable?−Process evaluation which will present a SWOT analysis and action plan
7.Do the data collection procedures effectively collect the data required for
a full trial? Successful completion of at least one data collection outcome
measure (BMI, physical activity or healthy eating) at both baseline and at 12
months in those retained measured using the following scale:−If > 90% of at least one data collection measure completed proceed;

quantities and costs are reported. The feasibility of using
the EuroQol EQ5D-3L [ 24] instrument and the
ICECAP-A [ 25] instrument as a means of capturing any
short term effects on health-related quality of life or
capability wellbeing was assessed. This involved explor-
ing data completeness and response rates. Participant
responses for both instruments were converted to a
utility score using the value set elicited from UK general
population.
Main analyses
Baseline characteristics were summarised. Feasibility
measures were the primary focus of the analysis. Rates
of recruitment, randomisation and retention at 12
months follow-up, were calculated with 95% confidence
intervals. Usage data for the app and website was
explored, and a range of summary measures presented.
Exploratory outcomes were analysed using linear re-
gression models, with randomised group, the baseline
measurement of the outcome, age, gender and BMI as
predictor variables. Model residuals were assessed for
normality, and where necessary, outcome measures (atfollow-up and at baseline) were transformed to improve
model fit. All analyses were conducted under intention
to treat principles. Complete case analysis was used, un-
less more than 20% of cases were lost due to missing
data, in which case multiple imputation was also
performed. These analyses were exploratory and under-
powered, so no formal hypothesis testing was performed.
pvalues are presented for descriptive purposes, as a
guide to the interpretation of the magnitude of reported
associations. Effect sizes were calculated by dividing
intervention effect estimates by the pooled standard de-
viation of the change from baseline in the outcome
measure, and reported in line with CONSORT guide-
lines for reporting feasibility and pilot studies [ 39].
Health economic analyses
The health economics cost data were analysed as fol-
lows: Resource use data were summarised and described
using mean values and variation around these estimates.
Key fixed and variable costs of developing the interven-
tion were described and summarised. EQ5D-3 L [ 24]

within-attribute response rates, mean values and associ-
ated variance. Within-trial economic analyses were per-
formed using STATA 12.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA).
Qualitative analyses
Qualitative data were analysed by two researchers who
independently coded using thematic analysis [ 40,41].
Twenty percent of the interviews were double coded by
two researchers who resolved disagreements by discus-
sion. The coding framework was discussed between the
researchers and also within the wider study team tofinalise the themes and sub-themes. The results of the
qualitative analyses were combined with intervention
usage data to explore and refine the HelpMeDoIt!
programme theory, in order to better understand the
mechanisms and key contextual factors to consider
when refining the intervention and evaluation design.
Results
109 participants were recruited to the HelpMeDoIt! trial
(Fig. 2) and randomised 2:1 to the intervention ( n= 73)
and control group ( n= 36). Baseline characteristics

included 69.7% ( n= 73) women, mean age of 47 (range
25–68), mean BMI 37.6 kg/m2and 36% were from the
highest quintile (most deprived) of socioeconomic
deprivation (Table 3)[15]. Key findings are presented
below, with additional detailed findings published in our
monograph [ 15].
Progression criteria
The pre-specified progression criteria (Table 1) were
achieved [ 15]. It was feasible to recruit and retain partic-
ipants in the trial (progression criteria 1 –3). Our target
sample size was 120 participants. Our recruitment was
hampered by a 2-month delay in gaining governance ap-
provals. We recruited 109 participants over a 6-month
period (91% of our target). In order to keep within the
study timeline we had to stop recruitment at 6 months.This was just short of our target which would likely have
been achieved if part of our recruitment had avoided the
summer holiday months. The slightly smaller sample
size was not an issue in terms of the study aims, in order
to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the interven-
tion and evaluation methods the sample size we
recruited was sufficient. At 12 months we achieved a
follow-up rate of 77.1% (84 of 109 participants). Follow-
up rates were different between intervention and control
groups (71% and 89%, respectively). We developed an
intervention that was feasible to deliver and acceptable
to helpers and participants (see the ‘Process evaluation
findings ’section data) (progression criteria 4). Two
thirds of intervention participants (including those who
withdrew from the study) visited the app twice or more,
and 52% visited three times or more (progression criteria

data. Data collection methods were feasible to use except
for the 24-h multiple pass recall dietary measure, which
was poorly completed at baseline and therefore not used
at follow-up, and issues with obtaining valid accelerome-
try data (progression criteria 7). Barriers and challenges
to implementation have been planned for and are
surmountable (progression criteria 6). This is discussed
further below.
Process evaluation findings
A summary of the key findings from the process evalu-
ation is given below with further details published
elsewhere [ 15]. Interviews were conducted with 35 indi-
viduals (22 participants and 9 helpers at 6 months and 4
participants at 12 months). Most study participants
interviewed were positive and engaged with the HelpMe-
DoIt! intervention. All study participants used a helper
to support them with weight loss. Many of these helpers
were nominated through the app; however, for some
participants, this was done outside of the app. Social
support was a key element, with helpers providing
emotional, informational and instrumental support to
participants. The emotional support and encouragement
from helpers were seen as key. Many participants set
goals via the app (mean 13.1 range 0.143) for healthy
eating, physical activity and other behaviours. Partici-
pants reported monitoring their progress toward goals
and also using other apps for self-monitoring. Sixty-one
percent of the 954 goals created by participants were
completed. Participants who were most successful at
losing weight had varied and good social support and
were positive about the goal setting and self-monitoring.
Helpers described how they enjoyed supporting their
friend with their weight loss goals. They reported receiving
mutual support with their own lifestyle goals and that they
were more motivated to eat well and be active. Few helpers
used the app, they reported technical difficulties, lacking
confidence with smartphones, or preferring to support their
friend outside of the app, e.g. face-to-face interactions.
They believed their support contributed to their friend ’s
motivation to make healthy changes.
Interview findings helped inform refinement of the
programme theory and logic model. Motivation was
identified as a key mediator influencing behaviour and
encouragement from the helpers was important to boost
motivation. Participants reported positive lifestyle
changes in both their helpers and their broader social
network. Contextual factors like mood or significant
life changes were reported as influencing participants ’
engagement with the intervention. Factors highlighted
for consideration in future work included difficulty
asking friends/relatives for support, lack of availablesupport, social and group norms related to food and
exercise and personal barriers to lifestyle, such as
motivation.
Despite a 3-month testing phase, there were initial
technical issues with the app. The majority of dissatisfac-
tion and barriers to use were related to these issues. The
app underwent a ‘rebuild ’which resolved the software
problems. Participants who used the app most
frequently, once the technical issues were resolved,
provided the most positive feedback via both qualitative
and quantitative measures. Of the 54 (74%) participants
who downloaded the app, 48 (89%) used it twice or
more. In total, 45 helpers were invited, ranging from 1
to 8 helpers per participant. Of the 45 invited helpers,
25 (56%) accepted the invitation and downloaded the
app. Most helpers did not engage with the app on a fre-
quent basis. However, interview data indicated that
helpers were sometimes unclear how to use the app to
help their family or friend, with many providing support
through face-to-face interactions instead. While partici-
pants and helpers did not access the website regularly, it
is likely that one or two visits would be enough to get
the information needed. The app also delivered the key
information from the website via push notifications and
daily messages.
Although not part of the process evaluation, we asked
participants about the trial methods. They were positive
about the evaluation methods, such as the data collec-
tion measures and retention strategies and there was no
evidence of contamination in the data.
Exploratory outcomes
The feasibility trial was not powered to detect statisti-
cally significant changes, but to explore the feasibility
and sensitivity of measures for use in a definitive trial.
Three outcomes were assessed: BMI, physical activity
and diet. BMI was successfully measured in 98% of the
sample (82% objectively and 16% via self-report) and diet
(DINE questionnaire) in 96% (81 of 84). Physical activity
data were successfully collected via the self-report 7-day
physical activity recall from 96% of participants. How-
ever, objective accelerometry was only available from
46% of participants. The secondary outcomes were feas-
ible and acceptable to use.
Objective physical activity data showed moderate to
large effect size estimates acr oss several measures, par-
ticularly the daily step count and sedentary time (Table
4). There was no evidence to suggest that self-report
physical activity was different between those who did
and did not provide valid accelerometry data, thereby
increasing confidence in these results. However, these
outcomes were poorly completed with only 24 in the
intervention arm and 15 in the control providing valid
data. Both methods suggested a decrease in physicalSimpson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:133 Page 9 of 14

activity from baseline, with accelerometry showing a
decrease in both groups for MVPA, and self-report
showing a decrease in both groups for energy expend-
iture. With regard to the diet scores, there was low
power and no consistent patterns in terms of between-
group differences (Table 4).
Both groups showed similar reductions in BMI during
the study of −1.2 kg/m2(SD 2.4) in the intervention
group, and −0.9 kg/m2(SD 3.3) in the control group.
Mean kg weight loss for intervention participants was −
3.3 kg (SD 6.5) compared with −2.5 kg (SD 9.3) for con-
trol participants. Mean % weight loss for intervention
participants was −3.2% (SD 6.2%), and −2.3% (SD 8.7%)
for control participants (Table 4).
Sixty-six percent of 50 intervention group partici-
pants for whom weight was measured at both base-
line and follow-up had lost weight, compared to 53%
of 32 participants in the control group ( p= 0.26).
These analyses were exploratory and underpowered to
detect effects. However, for the key weight-related
outcomes of interest, the confidence intervals were
generally wide and therefore consistent with clinically
relevant benefits.
Economic evaluation
Total study intervention costs (fixed and variable) in-
cluded app development costs of £60,000 and incentive/
retention payments of £4360 (vouchers, newsletters). De-
pending upon throughout and lifespan, ‘per participant ’
cost will vary by study. The resource use patterns were
similar across groups; the main items of resource use
were GP, practice nurse, physiotherapist, A&E and
hospitalisations. The cost of lifestyle activities in the 3
months prior to follow-up was in the range £50 –55.
Mean weekly cost of food and drink at follow-up was in
the range of £75 –100 across both groups with most food
expenditure on groceries followed by meals out, take
away and alcohol spend. This pattern was the same
across both arms, at baseline and follow-up. Both QOL
and capability wellbeing questionnaires were completed
by participants at baseline and 12 months follow-up. At
12 months, 78 participants completed the EQ5D-3L [ 24],
ICECAP-A [ 25] and expenditure on food purchases.
Only 69 provided data on health, social and personal re-
source use. This was because a few participants at risk of
dropping out of the study were offered a ‘minimum data
set’that omitted the additional questions linked to re-
source use. The EQ5D and associated visual analogue
scale results revealed the typical ‘healthy population ’
values of around 0.7 –0.8 and revealed expected variation
in values between the measures. There were no implaus-
ible data for the EQ5D_3L. Full economic findings,
including medication use and mean group costs, can be
found in our published monograph [ 15].Overall, the results of the economic evaluation feasibil-
ity study showed that the questionnaires designed for
measuring resource use, lifestyle, grocery and alcohol
spend, health-related quality of life and capability would
be suitable for inclusion in a full study with some minor
re-design of the resource use questions.
There were no serious adverse events reported during
the study.
Discussion
Family and friends are likely to be a key influence on
weight-related health behaviours [ 4,5], since these are
the people whom we are closest to, spend most time
with and with whom we are likely to eat and exercise
with. For these reasons, they are likely important not
only for initiation of behaviour change, but also for
longer term maintenance. Although other apps/websites
develop user communities that offer social support, they
are unlikely to have such a large and sustained influence
as family and friends. This study assessed the feasibility
and acceptability and impact of a novel, theory-informed
weight loss intervention that combined evidence-based
behaviour change techniques with mobilising social sup-
port from a participant ’s close social network.
Overall, the study findings were positive indicating the
intervention and trial methods were feasible and accept-
able and both the qualitative and quantitative results in-
dicated the intervention had potential. Most effect size
estimates had confidence intervals that included 0.5 in
favour of the intervention, which would generally be
considered a moderate effect size for a low-cost inter-
vention of this nature. Although MVPA and energy
expenditure decreased in both groups, participants were
relatively active at baseline, with the intervention arm
achieving an average of 50 min and controls an average
of 36 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per
day. It should also be noted that studies have found that
people with obesity are likely to over-estimate their
physical activity using self-report measures [ 42]. In
addition, all key progression criteria were achieved, re-
cruitment rates were adequate (91% of target), retention
was good (77.1% at 12-months) and engagement with
the intervention was acceptable.
Qualitative data supported the programme theory of
the intervention (Fig. 1)[15], since the app facilitated
engaging support from people that participants already
knew to help their weight loss attempts. The findings
supported the key role of social support from existing
social networks. Motivation, goal setting and self-
monitoring were supported as core elements of the
programme theory. The app was a catalyst to engaging
social support either via the app or outside of the app. It
is likely that a number of participants in the study who
enrolled or downloaded the app did not engage orSimpson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:133 Page 11 of 14
benefit from the intervention. However, this does not
undermine the potential reach and cost effectiveness, as
there is some evidence that the app may be useful for
some individuals and this is a low-cost way to facilitate
social support from close social networks, which is
known to be effective in assisting and maintaining be-
haviour change.
The low engagement with the website by both partici-
pants and helpers suggests a need for better signposting,
linking to website information within the app, or
perhaps that the website is not needed. There was also
low engagement of helpers via the app. Technical issues
with the app in the early stages of the trial may have led
to participants disengaging with the app and the trial.
Adherence to the intervention was superior to that seen
in general app usage [ 43] and similar to that seen in
other studies testing behaviour change apps [ 44,45]. An
expert international workshop concluded that engage-
ment with apps is complex and is more than how often
a person simply uses an app [ 46]. Continued engage-
ment with a digital intervention (app/website) is not
always needed for behaviour change, as initial exposure
to a digital intervention could be enough to kick start a
process of establishing new skills and habits [ 46]. This is
particularly relevant to HelpMeDoIt!, where a brief inter-
action with the website or app could lead to the engage-
ment of significant and sustained social support from
existing, stable and durable social resources. The effects
of this support on resultant behaviour are not dependent
on further app use.
The study had a number of key strengths. The inter-
vention was developed with substantial input from
potential users and was developed using recommended
frameworks for developing complex interventions and
digital interventions. The intervention was theory-based
and informed by current evidence regarding successful
behaviour change techniques for weight loss. We used a
multiple methods approach and were able to triangulate
these data to strengthen the internal and external valid-
ity of the findings.
The feasibility trial used rigorous methods for data
collection and analyses. Objective measures were used to
assess weight, BMI and physical activity, and self-report
measures were chosen based on previous evidence of
validity and reliability. The study also included measures
of quality of life and capability wellbeing and collected
cost data to inform a future cost-effectiveness analysis.
We recruited a clinically important sample with a mean
BMI of 37.6 kg/m2(SD 5.9). We were particularly
successful in recruiting participants from lower socio-
economic groups with over a third from the highest
quintile of deprivation in Scotland and a further 21%
from the next most deprived quintile. This is important
as research has shown that it is often difficult to recruitand engage participants from lower socioeconomic
groups in research [ 47] and many current interventions
widen inequalities [ 48]. Finally, the qualitative methods
were robust, and the large number of interviews gave ex-
tensive, in-depth accounts of the experiences of both the
study participants and their helpers. The findings from
the process evaluation informed refinements of the
programme theory, logic model and trial methods in an-
ticipation of a future effectiveness trial.
Limitations of the study included ethical constraints
during the stage 2 follow-up, which meant that we were
unable to invite helpers directly to be interviewed.
Because of this, the number of helper interviews was
smaller than anticipated. Only about half the partici-
pants had complete accelerometry data. A wrist worn
accelerometer may have had better compliance. In other
similar studies, strategies like vouchers for return of the
accelerometers have led to improved adherence and
return rates, so vouchers combined with other methods
could significantly improve return rates in a future trial
[49,50].
While the aim of this research was to develop an inter-
vention that maximised effect size and participation, an
intervention like this could have high reach and there-
fore tolerate small effects and low usage overall while
remaining cost-effective. For some people, meaningful
engagement will be catalysed by the app for whom the
effects should be worthwhile. It will also be important to
consider the contribution of such mHealth approaches
within the wider ecological public health context for
weight management and sustained weight reduction. If
the intervention was found to be effective in a larger
trial, then HelpMeDoIt! may have the potential to deliver
a low-cost, high-reach intervention for adults with obes-
ity, including those in socioeconomically disadvantaged
groups. It could be used as a complementary interven-
tion used alongside other health care or lifestyle services.
HelpMeDoIt! may have potential to positively influence
the lifestyle of individuals in a participants ’broader so-
cial network. This approach to mobilising social support
for health behaviour change could be used in other life-
style behaviours or used as part of other app-based in-
terventions. Key areas of future work include further
exploration of the key mechanisms of change as well as
the motivation and engagement of helpers in relation to
providing social support to participants and then after
some refinement, assessment of the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of the HelpMeDoIt! intervention.
