Objective: The present study investigated the influence of exercise-specific motivation and volition on
weight loss maintenance following an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI). Method: The study partici-
pants were 164 individuals with obesity (body mass index [BMI] /H1102230 kg/m2) that participated in an ILI.
Participants’ exercise-specific volition and motivation were assessed before and after the intervention aswell as 3 and 12 months after completion. Volition was measured with the Volition in ExerciseQuestionnaire and motivation was measured with the context translated Sport Motivation Scale. Results:
Mixed model analysis revealed that when adjusting for gender, age, and education, the 6 volitional scalesand intrinsic motivation predicted BMI across the 4 time points, whereas 6 volitional scales and 2extrinsic regulation scales showed a time interaction. Backward elimination multiple mixed modelanalysis revealed that Volitional Inhibition - Postponing Training and Volitional Facilitation - Self-Confidence predicted BMI development, whereas Volitional Inhibition - Unrelated Thoughts, IdentifiedRegulation, and Introjected Regulation showed a time interaction above and beyond the other scales.Conclusion: Exercise-specific volition and motivation influence weight loss maintenance following an
ILI. Volitional self-confidence and the tendency to postpone training are of importance above and beyondthe previously identified predictor of autonomous exercise motivation. Results of the study also indicatethat extrinsic motivation can be either facilitating or counterproductive depending on the level ofself-determination.

Obesity is considered to be one of the leading health concerns in
the world ( World Health Organization, 2013 ). Consequently, both
in the scientific community as well as in society in general, a greatnumber of resources have been devoted to developing noninvasivemethods for helping individuals battling with obesity obtain and
maintain weight loss. Noninvasive interventions assist individualswith obesity in obtaining and maintaining weight loss throughchanges, for example, in their diet and exercise behavior. How-ever, the success rates of such programs are, at best, moderate, andin the long term, very few individuals actually succeed in over-coming obesity ( Christiansen, Bruun, Madsen, & Richelsen,
2007 ).Recent literature suggests that the task of weight maintenance is
so difficult because the body prefers regain over maintenance(Ochner, Barrios, Lee, & Pi-Sunyer, 2013 ). Evidence suggests that
factors such as gender ( Rolls, Fedoroff, & Guthrie, 1991 ), age
(McTigue, Hess, & Ziouras, 2006 ), and societal status determined
by income and education ( Drewnowski, 2009 ) are of importance to
both the prevalence of obesity and the effectiveness of interven-tions. However, it has recently been suggested by Dandanell, Ritz,
Verdich, Dela, and Helge (2017) that repeated participation in
weight loss programs could be a solution to obtaining long-termweight loss. The investigated weight loss program in the Dandanellet al. publication combined calorie restriction, several hours ofdaily physical activity, and behavioral counseling in a communitysetting in which the participants were away from their daily lifeand were together with like-minded people who shared the goal oflosing weight. Studies investigating the psychological factors un-derlying the success of such interventions, hereafter referred to asintensive lifestyle interventions (ILIs), however, are lacking. Re-
search has shown that for weight loss maintenance, regular par-ticipation in exercise activities is especially important when com-pared with other relevant activities, such as eating behavior(Teixeira et al., 2015 ). However, adherence to such activities has
also proven to be a difficult task for individuals battling obesity
(Colley et al., 2008 ).
Successful exercise adherence for individuals with obesity has
been associated with motivational and self-regulatory factors

(Silva et al., 2011 ). Promising results have shown that self-
regulation skills impact weight control in studies on short-term(/H1102112 months) weight control ( Teixeira et al., 2015 ); however,
these self-regulation skills often refer merely to discrete behaviors(e.g., self-weighing) and are rarely based on sound theory. Theunderlying psychological mechanisms behind self-regulation skillsare not well described. Research on the underlying psychologicalfactors of a successful intervention has focused mainly on themotivational constructs of Deci and Ryan’s (2000) self-
determination theory and self-efficacy based on Bandura’s (1989)
social cognitive theory ( Teixeira et al., 2015 ). Although motiva-
tional constructs provide knowledge about why certain goals arechosen over others, they do not provide knowledge about theself-regulatory mental processes that underlie concrete planningand carrying out of needed actions in order to achieve the goal.Such mental processes are described by the construct volition , for
example, in the personal system interaction theory ( Kuhl, 2000 ).
Motivational psychologists following this theory have argued for aclear distinction between motivation and volition, and an inclusionof both constructs when explaining human behavior ( Gollwitzer &
Oettingen, 2012 ;Heckhausen, 1991 ;Kuhl, 1992 ). This distinction
between the motivational and volitional phases of goal-directedhuman behavior is described in the Rubicon model of actionphases. In this model, two phases are labeled as motivational and
two are labeled as volitional in nature. The first phase, the prede-
cisional phase—in which the goal is formulated and positiveconsequences of achieving the goal are considered—requires amotivational mind-set. The second phase, the preactional phase, iswhen the concrete steps of reaching the goal are planned and avolitional mind-set is required. The third phase, the actional phase,is when the individual engages in the actual action required toreach the goal. This phase also requires a volitional mind-set.Finally, in the fourth phase, the postactional phase, the goal pursuitand the related consequences are evaluated, and in this phase, theindividual has a motivational mind-set ( Heckhausen, 1991 ). One
important conclusion of a large systematic review examining theimportance of psychological factors’ for weight loss maintenancewas that a combination of implementation factors and motivationwas found to be important, and that “there is some indication thatthe latter may be especially useful in early stages of behavioraladoption, whereas motivational factors may be operative along theentire continuum from adoption to maintenance, as highlightedrecently in a separate study.” ( Teixeira et al., 2015 , p. 25). This
conclusion is in accordance with the argument of combiningvolition and motivation when explaining behavior as suggested bythe Rubicon model of action phases ( Heckhausen, 1991 ).
Research on the importance of volition in the area of exercise
psychology is very limited; however, volitional skills have provento be a sound predictor of performance in other areas of sport suchas elite sports ( Elbe, Szymanski, & Beckmann, 2005 ;Wenhold,
Elbe, & Beckmann, 2009 ). Research on the underlying mecha-
nisms behind exercise-specific self-regulation factors has focusedmainly on the motivational phases of the Rubicon model of actionphases. Thus far, no studies have simultaneously looked at thepsychological constructs involved in all four action phases. This isin contrast to what is suggested in recent literature and presents aresearch gap. Recent literature suggests that in order to understandhow the psychological constructs of exercise-specific motivationand volition influence the weight maintenance process, it is notsufficient to investigate them in isolation. In order to fully under-
stand their effect, one must control for the effect of the otherconstructs ( Slovinec D’Angelo, Pelletier, Reid, & Huta, 2014 ).
As described above, Teixeira and colleagues (2015) suggested
that motivational and volitional factors might operate differently inthe diverse phases from adaptation to maintenance. It was there-fore a priori hypothesized that the effect of exercise-specific mo-tivational and volitional factors on weight loss maintenance andexercise adherence would be significantly different in the adapta-tion phase compared with the maintenance phase. Furthermore, itwas a priori hypothesized that their effect would become larger asdistance from baseline increased. To investigate this hypothesis,the psychological predictors’ interactions with time should beinvestigated ( Heckhausen, 1991 ;Teixeira et al., 2015 ). So the
purpose of the present study was therefore to include the psycho-logical variables relevant for all four action phases and to inves-tigate whether exercise-specific motivation and volition predictexercise activity levels and weight loss maintenance success afteran ILI.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Ethical approval was obtained from the local Research Ethics
Committee in Copenhagen, Denmark (No. H-3–2013-146). Thestudy design was reported to clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01997034,
NCT01997060). Informed consent was obtained from all partici-pants.
This study focused on participants at an ILI at Ubberup Folk
High School in Denmark. Ubberup Folk High school has beenoffering specialized courses in lifestyle changes since 2000. Ub-berup offers four courses each year and approximately 80 individ-uals participate each time. The participants live at the folk highschool for 14 weeks. During this time, they need to take time offfrom their regular jobs, which can result in loss of salary, and haveto pay around €3,000 (3,500 $) in fees to the school. At the
beginning of the stay, a team of professional staff, comprised ofphysiologists, physiotherapists, psychological coaches, and teach-ers, tailors a physical activity schedule and a diet plan according tothe individual participant’s specific physical and psychologicalrequirements/characteristics. The individual goals of the partici-pants are adjusted weekly in collaboration with the staff at theschool. On a regular day, exercise classes, cooking classes, andtheoretical classes on different subjects relevant for successfullyadopting a lifestyle change are held between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00p.m. In addition, the participants choose classes that are not relatedto their lifestyle change; examples of these classes include singing,art, religion, politics, debate, and philosophy. Physiologists andphysiotherapists supervise the exercise classes, and cooks anddieticians teach practical cooking lessons. The participants areoffered psychological coaching from a certified coach during theirstay. In the coaching sessions, different areas in line with theindividual’s needs are addressed; however, one area that is coveredfor most participants is ensuring that the lifestyle change obtainedat Ubberup Folk High School is sustainable and continues beyondthe intervention. Dandanell (2016) , using both accelerometer and
dietary measures, showed that the participants at Ubberup arephysically active between 1 and 3 hr each day at a moderate to lowThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

intensity and that they have an average energy deficit of 500 to 700
kcal/day. Dandanell and colleagues (2017) provides a thorough
description of the content of the ILI.
Data were collected before and after the 14-week-long ILI
(Time 1 [T1]) and Time 2 ([T2]) as well as at two follow-upmeasurement points 3 months (Time 3 [T3]) and 12 months (Time4 [T4]) after the ILI ended. Data at T1 and T2 were collected via
paper and pencil directly at Ubberup, whereas data at T3 and T4were collected via an electronic questionnaire that was distrib-uted via e-mail. Participants from three consecutive courseswere recruited. Only participants with obesity (body mass index[BMI]/H1135030 kg/m
2) at the beginning of the ILI were included in
the study. These 164 participants were aged 33.0 ( SD/H1100515.0)
years on average, and 67.1% of them were female. With regardto the highest completed level of education, 39.6% reportedhigh school or less, 30.5% short secondary education, and20.1% had completed a university education (9.8% did notreport). All participants were informed in writing before andgave their consent to participate before in writing before thestudy began.
Measures
Volition. Exercise-specific volition was measured with the
Volition in Exercise Questionnaire (VEQ; Elsborg, Wikman,
Nielsen, Tolver, & Elbe, 2017 ). The VEQ measures six aspects
of volition with a total of 18 items. The six different aspects aredivided into four volitional inhibition (VI) factors that hinder anindividual’s goal attainment and two volitional facilitation (VF)factors that facilitate goal attainment. VI Focus on Reason forTraining (two items; e.g., “During my exercise activity I oftenfocus on my reason for participating”) refers to the extent towhich an individual deliberates on the reasons for participatingin the activity. VI Postponing Training (four items; e.g., “I oftenexperience that I really need to pull myself together to partic-ipate in my exercise activity”) refers to the extent to which theindividual lacks energy to engage actively in the activity, thatis, the tendency to procrastinate in relation with the activity. VIUnrelated Thoughts (three items; e.g., “During my exerciseactivity I find it difficult to concentrate because my thoughtsdrift to other things than the activity itself”) refers to the extentto which the individual can concentrate by shutting out un-wanted thoughts and emotions. VI Focus on Approval FromOthers (three items; e.g., “I feel I have to meet others’ expec-tations during my exercise activity”) refers to what extent theindividual is susceptible to other people’s opinions in conjunc-tion with exercising. VF Self-Confidence (three items; e.g., “Iam convinced that I am able to carry out strenuous exerciseactivities”) refers to what extent the individual feels that he orshe can succeed in the exercise context. And finally, VF CopingWith Failure (three items; e.g., “When I make a mistake duringmy exercise activity I quickly move on”) entails to what extentthe individual can cope with and learn from an experience offailure. The questionnaire applies a Likert-scale answering for-mat from 0 /H11005does not correspond at all to 3/H11005corresponds
exactly .
Motivation. A Danish version of the Sport Motivation Scale
(Pelletier et al., 1995 ) was used to measure motivation concerning
exercise. The SMS measures three different aspects of motivationwith a total of 28 items. Intrinsic Motivation (12 items; e.g., “For
the pleasure of discovering new training techniques”) measures theextent to which an individual is motivated to participate in exerciseby the activity itself and not by external rewards. Extrinsic Moti-vation (EM) assesses whether an individual is motivated to par-ticipate in exercise for obtaining positive or avoiding negativeconsequences. EM is divided in three different types: EM Identi-fied Regulation (four items; e.g., “Because it is one of the bestways to develop new aspects of myself.”), EM Introjected Regu-lation (four items; e.g., “Because I must exercise to feel good aboutmyself”), EM External Regulation (four items; “Because peoplearound me believe that it is important to be in shape.”). Finally, thethird type of motivation is Amotivation (four items, e.g., “It is notclear to me anymore. I don’t think I belong in exercise”), whichrefers to the extent to which the individual lacks motivation toparticipate in exercise. The questionnaire applies a Likert-scaleanswering format from 0 /H11005does not correspond at all to 6/H11005
corresponds exactly . Each item answers the question “What ap-
peals to you in exercise?” The Danish version of the SMS wasdeveloped prior to this study and adjusted from the elite context tothe exercise context using the translation and back-translationmethod.
Weight loss maintenance. In order to investigate motivation
and volition’s influence on weight loss maintenance, participants’weight and height were measured before and after the ILI byUbberup’s nutritionist. At the 3- and 12-month follow-ups, theparticipants self-reported their weight. The participants’ BMIswere calculated at each time point based on these measurements.Successful weight loss maintenance has been described as “losingat least 10% of initial body weight and keeping it off for at least 1year” ( Wing & Hill, 2001 , p. 323). However, in the analytic
approach of this study, weight loss maintenance was determinedby the development of BMI, which was used as a continuousvariable at all four time points.
Demographic information. Age, gender, and education level
were assessed in a biographical section of the questionnaire. Ed-ucation level was assessed with the question “What is the highestlevel education you have completed?” For each category, exam-ples of common education programs in Denmark were given. Ifuncertain, the participant had the opportunity to ask the question-naire administrator (the first author of this article).
Exercise participation. Exercise participation was mea-
sured with the same self-report question both before and at the12-month follow-up. This measure has not previously beenvalidated. Exercise participation was defined as organized ac-
tivities with a physical aspect in which participants had to getdressed to participate. Based on this definition, participantswere asked to report their weekly activity in exercise by an-swering the following question: “How often do you participatein exercise?” The participants were given the following eightresponse options: 1 /H11005never ,2/H11005less than once a month ,3/H11005
1–2 times a month ,4/H110051 time a week ,5/H110052 times a week ,6/H11005
3 times a week ,7/H110054 times a week , and 8 /H110055 times a week or
more . These responses were then coded to weekly participation.
The first author was present at the first data collection, whichmeant that the participants could ask for examples of activitiesand if a certain activity could be regarded as exercise, if they
did not understand the provided definition.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Statistical Analysis
This was the first study investigating the predictive power of
exercise-specific volition and exercise-specific motivation in com-bination; therefore, an exploratory approach was undertaken. Toinvestigate the effects of the psychological predictors (motivationand volition) on BMI and possible interactions (Predictor /H11003Time),
linear mixed models was performed. The Predictor /H11003Time inter-
action was included in the model to investigate whether the pre-dictors have different effects on the dependent variable at differenttimepoints. In order to investigate the joint predictive power of thevolitional and motivational factors, and given the exploratorynature of this study, a multiple stepwise mixed model was con-ducted. Only the significant predictors were included in the step-wise regression. Mixed models as a statistical method was chosenboth because it can include all variables at all four time points andbecause it can deal with missing data. This was done with theassumption that outcomes changed linearly over time during theintervention and in between follow-up time points. Variance com-ponents were used as covariance structure. Subject differenceswere modeled as random effects. Statistical analyses were con-ducted using SPSS 23.
Results
Study Variable Summary
Of the 164 participants that were included in the study, 103
completed the psychological questionnaires at T2, 98 at T3, and 74at T4. Some participants had missing answers in the question-naires, which meant that the valid Nof each variable, even at the
same time point, differed. Descriptive statistics of the study vari-ables are presented in Table 1 .
As shown in Table 2 , and as expected, several of the psycho-
logical predictors were significantly correlated. In order to ensurethat multicollinearity was not an issue a variance inflation factor(VIF) was calculated for the psychological predictors at baseline.The VIF values for the predictors were between 1 and 10 (range /H11005
1.36–2.36), which means that it can be concluded that there wereno multicollinearity issues ( Kutner, Nachtsheim, & Neter, 2004 ).
Reliability
Scale reliabilities for the scales of VEQ and SMS were analyzed
with Cronbach’s alpha. A value of .70 was regarded as an accept-able value ( Streiner, 2003 ). Values are presented in Table 1 . All
SMS scales showed good reliability. The VEQ scales also showedgood reliability, with the exception of the two scales VI ApprovalFrom Others (T1, /H9251/H11005 .67; T2, /H9251/H11005 .67; T4, /H9251/H11005 .66) and VI
Reasons (T2, /H9251/H11005.68; T4, /H9251/H11005.69), which were slightly under the
threshold.
Separate Mixed Model Analysis
In every model gender, age, and education status were con-
trolled for. Models with participation in exercise as the outcomeconfirmed it as a strong predictor of BMI. All psychological scalespredicted exercise participation in the expected directions with theexception of VI Approval From Others (see Table 3 ).

Separate mixed model analysis revealed that the four volitional
factors—VI Approval From Others, VI Reasons, VI UnrelatedThoughts, and VI Postponing Training—positively predicted BMI(when volitional inhibition increases, BMI increases). VF Self-Confidence and Intrinsic Motivation negatively predicted BMI. Asignificant time interaction was found for VF Self-Confidence, VFCoping With Failure, and EM Identified Regulation, so that anincrease in the psychological factor led to a decrease in BMI at T4.A significant time interaction was found for VI Reasons, VIUnrelated Thoughts, VI Postponing Training and EM IntrojectedRegulation so that an increase in the psychological factor led to anincrease in BMI at T4. For VI Unrelated Thoughts, a significantdifference was also found at the 3-month follow-up point (T3; seeTable 4 ).
Stepwise Backward Elimination Multiple Mixed Model
Analysis
A stepwise backward elimination multiple mixed model analy-
sis was conducted; the time interactions of the predictors wereeliminated first, beginning with the highest pvalue. Second, the
predictors were eliminated, beginning with the highest pvalue. Asummary can be found in Table 5 . The final model included one
predictor contributing with a negative main effect, VF Self-Confidence ( /H9252/H11005/H11002 0.51), and one predictor with a positive main
effect, VI Postponing Training ( /H9252/H11005 0.59). Three predictors con-
tributed with a time interaction effect. Parameter estimates for thetime interaction of VI Unrelated Thoughts and EM IntrojectedRegulation revealed that the effects at T3 and T4 were signifi-cantly different compared with the effect at T1. Parameter esti-mates for the time interaction of EM Identified Regulation showedthat the effect was significantly different at T2, T3, and T4 com-pared with the effect at T1. With all three interactions, the effectincreased as the distance from baseline grew larger (see Table 6 ).
Discussion
The current study addressed several important gaps in the liter-
ature with regard to the role of exercise-specific psychologicalconstructs for exercise participation and weight loss maintenancein the crucial period following an ILI. Further, the study is the firstto investigate exercise-specific volition and motivation in the samestudy, thereby covering all four phases of the Rubicon model ofaction phases ( Heckhausen, 1991 ). The study provides evidenceTable 2

that exercise participation as well as exercise-specific volition and
motivation are prospectively associated with BMI in the expecteddirections across a 3-month ILI as well as in the 12-month periodfollowing the intervention. Furthermore, both exercise-specificvolition and motivation predict exercise participation in the3-month period of the intervention and the following 12 monthsafter the intervention. The study looked at a pattern of significanceand the pvalues were only suggestive of significance in the
population. This means that the results will need to be replicated ina larger sample in order to be able to statistically refer the results
to the larger population; however, given that this is the first studyto combine these psychological constructs, the initial findings wereinteresting.
Analysis of the psychological scales revealed that the volitional
scales VI Reasons, VI Unrelated Thoughts, VI Postponing Train-ing, and VF Self-Confidence had an overall effect on BMI, and theeffect was significantly stronger at the 12-month follow-up point.For VI Unrelated Thoughts, the effect was also significantly stron-ger at the follow-up point 3 months after the intervention. Theoverall effect means that these psychological constructs affect anindividual’s weight loss process through an ILI, and the fact thatthe effect is stronger at the 3-month and 12-month follow-upTable 4

points indicates that they are of special importance for weight loss
maintenance in the period following the ILI. VI Approval fromothers and Intrinsic Motivation showed only an overall effect onparticipants’ BMI, which means that these constructs are importantto weight loss through an ILI but not more important for weightloss maintenance in the period following an ILI than during. VFCoping With Failure, EM Identified Regulation, and EM Intro-jected Regulation did not show an overall effect, however, but aneffect at the follow-up point 12 months after the intervention. Thisindicates that they are important for weight loss maintenance in theperiod after the ILI when the individual has to maintain theobtained weight loss in his or her “natural” environment, but notfor the weight loss process in general. Finally, a mixed model withall psychological variables revealed that, above and beyond theother constructs, the volitional scales VI Postponing Training andVF Self-Confidence had a main effect, whereas VI UnrelatedThoughts, EM Identified Regulation, and EM Introjected Regula-tion were important over time. A multiple backward eliminationmixed model analysis revealed that the scales VF Self-Confidenceand VI Postponing Training had an effect even when controllingfor the other scales, meaning that they provide unique informationabove and beyond them. Similarly the scales VI UnrelatedThoughts, EM Identified Regulation, and EM Introjected Regula-tion provided a unique interaction effect across time.
Additional analysis with exercise participation confirmed pre-
vious findings of exercise-specific volition ( Elsborg et al., 2017 )
and exercise-specific autonomous motivation ( Teixeira, Carraça,
Markland, Silva, & Ryan, 2012 ) as sound predictors of participa-
tion in exercise, and that participation in exercise is a soundpredictor of weight loss maintenance for individuals battling obe-sity ( Haslam & James, 2005 ). The novelty of this study is that both
motivational and volitional factors were included in the same studyto predict this.
The findings of this study suggest that exercise-specific volition
has an effect on weight loss through an ILI both in general and asa facilitator of weight loss maintenance in the period following theintervention. The multiple mixed model even suggests that, over-all, the effect of volitional scales VI Postponing Training and VFSelf-Confidence was above and beyond that of the other psycho-logical scales included in this study. This suggests that thesevolitional aspects are more important for weight loss maintenancethan motivational constructs of self-determination theory. Theseresults corroborate the findings of the role of volitional skills withregard to performance level in elite sports ( Elbe et al., 2005 ;
Wenhold et al., 2009 ). To our knowledge, this is the first study
investigating the effects of exercise-specific volitions’ role in theprocess of weight loss maintenance.
Our findings with regard to motivation provide an important
extension to previous research on nonintensive weight loss inter-ventions ( Teixeira et al., 2015 ) by demonstrating that the construct
intrinsic motivation is also important for both weight loss main-tenance during an ILI and in the period following the intervention.Another finding in this study was that EM Identified Regulationshowed a significantly different effect at the 12-month follow-uppoint on weight loss maintenance, whereas EM Introjected Regu-lation showed a significant effect in the opposite direction at the12-month follow-up point on weight loss maintenance in theperiod following an ILI. Identified regulation is defined as an
acceptance “of the underlying value of a behavior,” whereas in-trojected regulation is described as “regulations that are within the
person, but still relatively external to the self” ( Deci & Ryan, 2000 ,
p. 36). With these definitions in mind, the results of this studyindicate that extrinsic motivation has an impact when the under-lying value of participation in exercise is accepted, whereas aninternalization of external regulations can be counterproductive inthe long term.
There were both strengths and limitations of the present study.
One strength was that it investigated an ILI with professional staffand with committed participants who invested a significant amountof their own time and money in order to participate. Anotherstrength is that the ILI is an existing intervention already embed-ded in society. Limitations of this study include that the samplesize was fixed, and given the ratio between the number of predic-tors and the sample size, there was a risk of the study beingunderpowered. In such a situation, there is the risk of overfittingthe data and a risk that the statistical model becomes overlysensitive to minor fluctuations in the data, and thus describes therandom error in the data rather than the underlying relationships.Having said this, and given the fact that it was acknowledged thatthe study was of exploratory nature, it is clear that the study needsto be replicated in a larger sample. Furthermore, the self-reportedweight in the follow-up period could also be a limitation, as somestudies have shown that self-reporting weight is connected tomeasurement errors ( Rowland, 1990 ). Another limitation is that
exercise activity was assessed only via one item and assessed onlyat the 12-month and not at the 3-month follow-up. In addition,another limitation is that the reliability of the scales VI ApprovalFrom Others and VI Reasons was only borderline acceptable attwo of the measurement points. As a necessity primarily becauseof limited resources for the study, self-reported weight andquestionnaire-measured exercise participation was used. Futureresearch should investigate this with objective weight measures aswell as with either a validated instrument for measuring exerciseparticipation or objectively measured physical activity throughaccelerometers or GPS.
Overall, our findings indicate that exercise-specific volition and
self-determined motivation may be particularly beneficial for es-tablishing that an ILI has a long-lasting effect on weight loss.These findings may have a number of important practical impli-cations for both individuals, with the goal of overcoming obesity,and interventions staff designed to assist people with obesity toobtain and maintain weight loss. The most important practicalrecommendation from the results of this study is that an interven-tion should incorporate both training in volitional abilities anddeveloping autonomous exercise motivation. Working with imple-mentation intentions, for example, has shown to positively impactvolitional skills ( Gollwitzer & Brandstätter, 1997 ). At the same
time, it is important to ensure that individuals develop their mo-tivation toward exercise to the extent that they accept their exerciseactivity’s underlying value. Here, research suggests that samplingdifferent exercise activities in a task-oriented environment stimu-lates the development of autonomous motivation ( Edmunds, Ntou-
manis, & Duda, 2007 ).
Conclusion
This study has shown that exercise-specific volition and moti-
vation influence the task of weight loss maintenance following anThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

ILI. The results of the study indicate that exercise volition and, in
particular, volitional self-confidence and the tendency to postponetraining are of importance above and beyond the previous soundpredictor, autonomous exercise motivation of weight loss mainte-nance. Results of the study also indicate that extrinsic motivation
can be either facilitating or counterproductive depending on thelevel of self-determination, as identified regulation showed a pos-itive effect 12 months after the intervention, whereas internalregulation showed a negative effect on weight loss. More researchon how to influence exercise-specific volition in individuals bat-tling obesity is needed.
