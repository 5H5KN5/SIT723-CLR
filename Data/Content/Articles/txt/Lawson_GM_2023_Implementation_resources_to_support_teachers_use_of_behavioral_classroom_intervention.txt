Abstract 
Background Teacher-delivered behavioral classroom management interventions are effective for students 
with or at-risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other disruptive behavior challenges, but they can 
be difficult for teachers to use in the classroom. In this study, we will pilot test a package of implementation strategies 
to support teachers in using behavioral classroom interventions for students with ADHD symptoms.
Methods We will use a 2-group, randomized controlled trial to compare outcomes for teachers who receive Positive 
Behavior Management Implementation Resources (PBMIR), a theory and data-driven implementation resource pack -
age designed to increase teacher implementation of behavioral classroom management interventions, with those 
who do not receive this additional implementation support. We will measure teacher implementation outcomes (e.g., 
observed fidelity to behavioral classroom interventions) and student clinical outcomes (e.g., ADHD-related impair -
ment, ADHD symptoms, student–teacher relationship, academic performance) before and after an 8-week interven-
tion period for both groups; we will also measure teacher-reported acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility 
for the PBMIR group following the intervention period.
Discussion If there is preliminary evidence of feasibility and effectiveness, this pilot study will provide the foundation 
for evaluation the PBMIR at a larger scale and the potential to improve outcomes for students with or at risk for ADHD.
Trial registration This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. (https:// clini caltr  ials. gov/) on 8/5/2022 which 
was prior to the time of first participant enrollment. The registration number is: NCT05489081.

Background
Behavioral classroom management interventions, deliv -
ered by teachers in classrooms, show evidence for 
improving student behavioral and academic engagement 
outcomes [4]. Evidence-based classroom management 
interventions emphasize both antecedent- and posi -
tive consequence-based approaches to manage student 
classroom behavior, and are consistent with schoolwide 
frameworks such as Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS; [32, 33]. They can be delivered to all stu -
dents in the class (i.e., universal or Tier 1 practices), as 
well as with students who need additional support (i.e., 
targeted or Tier 2 interventions). These interventions 
are important for supporting children with or at-risk 
for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), for 
whom they show strong evidence of success [9, 10]. How -
ever, teachers often do not use Tier 1 and Tier 2 behavio -
ral classroom interventions as designed, if they use them 
at all [14, 23, 28]. This suggests a need for implementa -
tion strategies to support teachers in using these inter -
ventions. Implementation strategies are most likely to be 
effective when they are theory driven and target specific, 
malleable factors that influence provider behavior [22].
Behavioral classroom management interventions 
encompass a wide range of practices, which can vary 
along several dimensions, including whether they are 
designed to be applied to the entire class (i.e., Tier 1), 
or to targeted students only (i.e., Tier 2); whether they 
use antecedents, consequences, or both; and the time 
and effort they require to implement. Evidence suggests 
that teachers use some specific interventions more than 
others [28] and our prior work indicates that teachers’ 
intentions to use behavioral classroom interventions 
vary by specific intervention [20]. Our prior work also 
found that teacher-reported barriers and facilitators to 
using behavioral interventions differ between Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 interventions [21]. Together, this suggests that 
implementation strategies to support teachers in using 
behavioral classroom interventions should be tailored to 
specific intervention components.
The Theory of Planned Behavior [1] may be useful for 
developing implementation strategies because it delin -
eates two sets of factors that may influence teachers’ 
implementation: factors that promote their intentions 
to implement an intervention and factors that pro -
mote their ability to act on strong intentions [13]. It also 
delineates specific psychological determinants of inten -
tions: attitudes (e.g., whether a teacher “likes” or “dis -
likes” behavioral classroom management strategies for 
ADHD), social norms (e.g., whether the teacher perceives 
that other teachers use behavioral classroom manage -
ment strategies or whether their supervisor expects them 
to use them), and self-efficacy (e.g., whether teachers believe that they have the necessary skills to successfully 
implement behavioral classroom management practices). 
These determinants provide potential mechanisms for 
increasing implementation among teachers who report 
low intentions to use a behavioral intervention [13]. 
At the same time, for teachers who do not implement a 
behavioral intervention despite positive intentions to 
do so, implementation strategies should target teachers’ 
ability to act on their intentions [13]. Theories of habit 
formation [25], which propose that automatic behavior is 
triggered by situational or contextual cues, suggest spe -
cific strategies, such as reminders in the environment, to 
use when intentions are strong but not acted upon. For 
example, if a teacher is ambivalent about using a behav -
ioral classroom intervention, they may benefit from mes -
sages targeting attitudes or norms (e.g., narrative from 
other teachers about how they have found it helpful). On 
the other hand, if a teacher intends to use the interven -
tion but struggles to actually do so within a busy class -
room environment, they may benefit from reminders or 
strengthening habits.
Our team developed an implementation resource 
package (“Positive Behavior Management Implementa -
tion Resources, PBMIR”) to support teachers in using 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 behavioral classroom interventions, 
particularly with students with elevated levels of hyper -
activity, inattention or impulsivity. The resource pack -
age is informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior [1] 
and theories of habit formation [25], to target attitudes, 
norms, self-efficacy, habits, and reminders; it specifically 
targets barriers and facilitators identified by teachers 
as important in a previous study [21]. It uses a modular 
format to support teachers in using four key behavioral 
classroom management interventions: behavior-specific 
praise (i.e., providing frequent verbal acknowledgment 
by specifically labeling praise-worthy behavior; e.g., [6], 
precorrections (i.e., reminding students about behavioral 
norms prior to a time when behaviors of concern might 
be likely; e.g., [7]; brief and specific behavior corrections 
(i.e., consistently correcting behavior in a clear, concise 
and calm way; e.g., [28]; and use of daily behavior reports 
to provide feedback on specific behavioral goals (e.g., 
[28]. The PBMIR also includes two additional modules to 
support factors that were identified as critical for imple -
mentation of the target interventions: student–teacher 
relationships and adult wellness.
We developed the PBMIR through an iterative, com -
munity-partnered process, in which we made revisions 
based on feedback obtained from teachers during a series 
of try-outs of versions of the PBMIR; we interpreted try-
out data and made revisions in partnership with a Pro -
gram Development Team of stakeholders (e.g., teachers, 
coaches, administrators). We designed this resource 
Page 3 of 10
 Lawson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:151 
 
package to fit within existing school structures, align 
with school-wide Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS), and be feasible to sustain with existing 
resources. If effective, deploying this resource package as 
an implementation strategy at scale may help address the 
critical need of supporting teachers in using evidence-
based behavioral classroom interventions. An important 
first step, though, is to conduct a pilot study testing the 
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of 
the PBMIR.
Aims
The main objective of this study is to pilot test the imple -
mentation strategy resource package. We will evaluate 
the teacher-reported feasibility, acceptability and appro -
priateness of the resource package. We will also collect 
data on teacher implementation outcomes and child 
effectiveness outcomes to examine the promise of the 
resource package.
Method
Setting and sample
The study will be conducted in elementary or elemen -
tary-middle schools from a large urban school district in 
the Northeast United States. The district’s student body 
is racially and ethnically diverse (about 50% Black/Afri -
can American, 21% Hispanic/Latino, 14% Non-Hispanic 
White, 7% Asian, and 5% Multiracial or Other races). 
Approximately 80% of these students live in households 
that are income-eligible for free or reduced-price meals. 
We will recruit schools that have already adopted school -
wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports 
(PBIS) and will obtain written permission from principals 
for their schools’ participation, following school district 
processes.
Our target sample size is 30 teachers (teaching grades 
Kindergarten through 5th grade; with students of ages 
approximately 5 through 12) within participating schools 
over a two-year period. Teachers will nominate students 
in their classroom to participate (see “Procedures” sec -
tion). We will enroll 2 students per teacher, for a tar -
get sample size of 60 students. These sample sizes were 
selected to be consistent with guidelines for pilot studies 
to determine the feasibility of recruiting participants, col -
lecting outcome data, and retaining participants in the 
protocol [34].
Procedures
Recruitment and informed consent
All procedures are approved by the institutional research 
board at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the 
research review committee of the participating school 
district. Any protocol amendments will be reviewed and approved by the IRB and school district review board 
prior to any changes taking place, and ClinicalTrials.gov 
will be updated to reflect any relevant changes.
Teachers will be recruited from participating schools. 
See Table  1 for the schedule of enrollment, interven -
tions, randomization, and data collection. After provid -
ing informed consent for their participation, teachers 
will nominate two students from their classroom to par -
ticipate. Teachers will be instructed to nominate students 
who “show elevated levels of inattentive, hyperactive or 
impulsive behaviors;” whom “you think may benefit from 
increased use of positive behavior management prac -
tices, ” and “for whom you could use additional support 
in managing their behaviors. ” Teachers will complete 
the Impairment Rating Scale (IRS; [11], a 7-point scale 
ranging from 0 to 6, for each of these students, without 
providing identifying information about the student. To 
meet inclusion criteria, a student must receive a score of 
3 or greater on at least one IRS domain. If one or more 
of the nominated students does not meet this criterion, 
the teacher will nominate an additional student until two 
students are identified who meet this criterion. Students 
will be excluded from participation if they have a special 
education classification of intellectual disability, if their 
primary presenting concern is psychosis or autism spec -
trum disorder based on parent- or teacher- report, or if 
they present as in acute risk of harm to self or others, 
such that participation would be clinically inappropriate 
because they warrant more intensive intervention.
For each student who meets criteria, teachers will be 
asked to contact the student’s parent/legal guardian to 
obtain verbal permission for the research team to contact 
them, and for the teacher to provide the research team 
with their contact information. If a student’s parent/legal 
guardian declines permission or cannot be reached, the 
teacher will nominate an additional student and will com -
plete an IRS screening form regarding the student. If it is 
not possible to identify two children within a classroom 
who meet screening criteria and for whom informed con -
sent can be obtained, we will allow the teacher to partici -
pate with one enrolled child.
After permission from the parent/legal guardian is 
obtained, the teacher will provide the research team with 
the student’s name, parent’s name, contact information, 
and preferred method of contact. The research team will 
reach out to the parent/legal guardian and obtain their 
informed consent for the student’s participation.
Randomization
Teachers will be randomized to condition blocked on 
grade level (i.e., grades K-2 vs. 3–5) and school. The prin -
cipal investigator will generate the allocation sequence 
using online software (Sealed Envelope Ltd., 2022.) 
Page 4 of 10 Lawson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:151 
Students will be assigned to their teachers’ condition. 
A member of the research team will notify teachers of 
their assigned condition after baseline data collection is 
complete. If they are assigned to the “PBMIR” condition, 
the research team will schedule a meeting with them 
the week following randomization to provide them with 
a copy of the PBMIR, and the 8-week time period will start at that meeting. If they are assigned to the “Imple -
mentation Support as Usual” condition, the 8-week time 
period will start the following week, in order to ensure 
the timelines are comparable between conditions. Teach -
ers in the “Implementation Support as Usual” condition 
will be permitted to receive any implementation support 
that they would otherwise receive related to classroom Table 1 Schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments

management (which could include trainings or instruc -
tional coaching), and this support will be documented via 
teacher report at endpoint. Teachers in this condition will 
receive a copy of the PBMIR electronic, written, and tan -
gible resources following post- data collection to thank 
them for their participation. Children in both conditions 
will continue to receive any therapy or medication that 
they would otherwise receive during the study period, 
and parents will be asked to report about any medication 
their child takes at baseline and endpoint.
Positive Behavior Management Implementation Resources
The Positive Behavior Management Implementation Resources 
(PBMIR), previously developed using an iterative, commu -
nity-partnered process, is organized into six modules: (1) 
student–teacher relationships; (2) adult wellness; (3) behav -
ior-specific praise; (4) precorrections; (5) calm behavior-spe -
cific corrections; and (6) daily behavior reports.
Teachers will engage with the resource package for 
a period of 8  weeks. Each teacher is assigned a guide, 
who consults with the teacher during four, brief (i.e., 
15–20  min) meetings during this period to support 
their engagement. The guide assists the teacher with 
goal setting, identifying relevant resources, building 
motivation, problem solving, and reflecting on progress. 
The guide supports the teacher in selecting modules 
to work on, working within a consistent structure: first 
focusing on student–teacher relationships (either class-
wide or with the specific focal student), then focusing 
on behavior-specific praise, then proceeding to either 
precorrections or calmly-delivered behavior-specific 
corrections, and moving on to daily behavior reports 
last. Adult wellness resources for teachers are used if 
and when relevant.
Guides are supported by a written manual that consists 
of four sections: (1) an introduction with an overview, 
guiding beliefs (e.g., teachers are experts in their class -
rooms and their professional practice), and policies (e.g., 
confidentiality, scheduling); (2) an overview of the Theory 
of Planned Behavior; (3) process strategies (i.e., rapport 
building, motivational interviewing, goal setting, prob -
lem solving), and session agendas (i.e., a broad outline 
for the first session, follow-up sessions, and final session). 
Individuals serving in the guide role should be famil -
iar with the elementary school classroom context, child 
development, and core behavioral principles, but guides 
do not need to have a specific educational background.
In addition to guide meetings, the resource package 
includes the following components: (1) written one-page 
documents (e.g., overview, tip sheet with messages tar -
geting attitudes, norms, and strategies to use remind -
ers, document with sentence stems to provide sample 
language); (2) fillable planning guides; (3) optional text message reminders, for which teachers can select the fre -
quency and time to receive them; (4) the option to follow 
an ‘Instagram’ account with reminder posts and tips; (5) 
videos about the target practices, including teacher tes -
timonials; (6) a notepad to use for self-monitoring; and 
(7) tangible resources and reminders, including stickers 
and sticky notes. Teachers set their goals and choose the 
resources to use in collaboration with their guide.
Measures
Feasibility of research procedures
Recruitment rate
We will track the number of teachers and students 
enrolled in the study. We will also examine the pro -
portion of nominated and eligible students for whom 
informed consent is obtained.
Response rate
We will calculate the proportion of parent- and teacher- 
report surveys completed at each time point out of the 
number of teachers and students enrolled and rand -
omized across conditions.
Retention rate
We will record the number of teachers and students who 
withdraw from the study and will compute the reten -
tion rate for each group of participants (i.e., teachers, 
students) as the proportion of participants who do not 
withdraw out of the number of enrolled and randomized 
teachers and children across conditions.
Engagement with the resource package
We will track teachers’ use of specific aspects of the 
resource package by tracking: 1) the number of guide 
meetings attended by each teacher in the PBMIR condi -
tion; 2) the percentage of teachers in the PBMIR condi -
tion who agree to receive text message reminders; and 3) 
the percentage of teachers in the PBMIR condition who 
choose to follow the Instagram account.
Teacher implementation outcomes
Acceptability
Teachers in the resource package condition will com -
plete the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM; 
[37], which consists of four items (e.g., “[Intervention] 
is appealing to me”) on a 5-point Likert scale, regarding 
the resource package. Teachers will complete this meas -
ure at the end point, following their 8-week participation 
period. This measure has shown acceptable reliability 
(alpha ≥ 0.83) and test–retest reliability (Pearson correla -
tions above 0.70) in prior samples.
Page 6 of 10 Lawson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:151 
Appropriateness
Teachers will complete the Intervention Appropriateness 
Measure (IAM; [37], which consists of four items (e.g., 
“[Intervention] seems suitable”) on a 5-point Likert scale, 
regarding the resource package. Teachers will complete 
this measure at the end point. This measure has shown 
acceptable reliability (alpha ≥  0.87) and test–retest reli -
ability (Pearson correlations above 0.70) in prior samples.
Feasibility
Teachers will complete the Feasibility of Intervention 
Measure (FIM; [37], which consists of four items (e.g., 
[Intervention] seems easy to use”) on a 5-point Lik -
ert scale, regarding the four target interventions sup -
ported by the resource package. Teachers will complete 
this measure at the end point. This measure has shown 
acceptable reliability (alpha ≥  0.88) and test–retest reli -
ability (Pearson correlations above 0.70) in prior samples.
Fidelity
A member of the study team will conduct classroom 
observations at the baseline, midpoint and end point of 
study participation for teachers in both conditions. These 
observations will use a modified version of the Student 
Behavior Teacher Response (SBTR) scale [27]. Observers 
will record counts of focal student norm violations and 
teacher responses to norm violations (i.e., no response, 
inappropriate response, appropriate response). Observ -
ers will also record counts of teacher use of behavior-
specific praise, unlabeled praise, precorrections (directed 
at the focal students and overall), and teacher behaviors 
related to using daily behavior reports for focal students. 
We will observe these practices at both the universal and 
targeted levels because three of the target practices can 
be employed class-wide. Finally, the observer will rate the 
teachers’ global competence regarding classroom man -
agement and supportive relationships (with the whole 
class and with each target student) on a 7-point scale 
(from “poor” to “excellent”) following each observation. 
Approximately 20% of observations will be conducted by 
two observers so that inter-observer agreement can be 
calculated.
Child outcomes
Student–teacher relationship scale
Teachers will complete the Student–Teacher Relationship 
Scale [29] about participating children at the baseline 
and the end point. This scale assesses teachers’ percep -
tions of their relationship with individual students. The 
STRS has shown adequate test–retest reliability (r = 0.89) 
and good internal consistency (α = 0.89; [29]. It generates 
three subscales (conflicts, closeness, dependency) and an overall total score. The total score will be used as a sec -
ondary outcome measure.
ADHD symptoms and impairment
Teachers and parents will complete the NICHQ Vander -
bilt Scale [38] about participating children at the baseline 
and the end point. The inattention and hyperactivity/
impulsivity scales on the Vanderbilt have high internal 
consistency, acceptable test–retest reliability, and con -
vergent validity [3]. Teacher-report and parent-report 
on items related to adaptive functioning (e.g., “disrupting 
class, ” “relationship with peers”) will be used as a primary 
outcome measure, and teacher-reported and parent-
reported inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symp -
toms will be used as secondary outcome measures.
Academic performance rating scale
Teachers will complete the Academic Performance Rat -
ing Scale [8] about participating children at the baseline 
and the end point. This scale assesses teacher judgment 
of students’ academic functioning across two subscales: 
Academic Success (i.e., academic achievement) and Aca -
demic Productivity (i.e., day-to-day performance). The 
subscales are each measured by 8 items, rated on 5-point 
scales. They have acceptable internal consistency (0.72–
0.95), stability (0.88–0.95), criterion-related validity, and 
sensitivity to intervention [12, 24]. Teacher-reported 
Academic Productivity will be used as a primary out -
come measure and teacher-reported Academic Success 
will be used as a secondary outcome measure.
Direct behavior rating multi‑item scales (DBR‑MIS)
Teachers will complete ratings of child behavior using 
Direct Behavior Rating Multi-Item Scales (DBR-MIS; 
see [36]. For this study, teachers will rate behaviors in 
two domains: Engagement (5 items rating frequency of 
these behaviors on a 7-point scale ranging from Never 
to Almost Always) and Disruptive Behavior (5 items rat -
ing degree to which each item is a problem on a 7-point 
scale ranging from Not a Problem to Serious Problem). 
These domains of the DBR-MIS have demonstrated treat -
ment sensitivity [17]. Teachers will complete these rat -
ings at baseline, midpoint and endpoint. The average 
rating within domains will be used as secondary outcome 
measures.
Homework Performance questionnaire–parent form (HPQ‑P)
Parents will complete the Homework Performance Ques -
tionnaire-Parent Form [30] at baseline and endpoint. 
Parents will complete this measure for target students in 
grades 1–5. The student self-regulation factor, which has 
shown strong internal consistency (i.e., alpha’s between 
Page 7 of 10
 Lawson et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:151 
 
0.92 and 0.94; [30] will be used as a secondary outcome 
measure.
Potential mediators
Teacher intentions questionnaire
Teacher intentions to implement each of the four inter -
vention components will be measured using a stand -
ardized 4-item questionnaire [31]. The items will use 
validated stems designed to probe provider intentions 
to use a specific practice (e.g., “I intend to… ”), measured 
on a 7-point scale from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly 
agree. ” Teachers will be asked to complete these items 
“regarding students in your class who show elevated lev -
els of inattentive, impulsive, or hyperactive behaviors. ” 
Additionally, teachers will be asked to complete these 
items regarding participating children after the children 
have enrolled in the study.
Teacher determinants of intentions questionnaire
Teachers will complete a questionnaire with validated, 
standardized item stems (Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010) to 
report on their attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy for 
using behavioral classroom management interventions 
“regarding students in your class who show elevated lev -
els of inattentive, impulsive, or hyperactive behaviors. ”
Teacher self‑rated habit index (SRHI)
Teachers will complete the SRHI, a 12-item scale that 
assesses the automaticity of a behavior, as well as its 
frequency of repetition and assimilation into one’s self-
identity, regarding their use of behavior-specific praise 
at baseline and end point [35]. The SRHI has shown high 
internal consistency (i.e., alpha’s between 0.85 and 0.95) 
and convergent validity (i.e., correlation of r = 0.58 with 
response-frequency measure; [35].
Barriers and facilitators questionnaire
Teachers will report on the extent to which each of 10 
potential barriers (five classified as beliefs that weaken 
intentions, and five classified as challenges that inter -
fere with execution) and 12 facilitators (three classified 
as beliefs that strengthen intentions, seven classified as 
factors that assist with executing, and two classified as factors that assist with learning how to use the practice) 
impact their use of behavior-specific praise at baseline 
and endpoint. We developed these items from qualitative 
interview data from teachers in an earlier study [21].
Analytic approach
The primary goals of the analyses are to examine the fea -
sibility and preliminary effectiveness of the PBMIR pack -
age. We will examine the recruitment rate, response rate, 
retention rate to assess the feasibility of the research pro -
cedures, inform adjustments to procedures as necessary, 
and inform sample size estimates in a larger trial as indi -
cated. Consistent with recommendations [2] we will use 
traffic light criteria to determine whether the research 
protocol should proceed to a full trial unchanged 
(“green”), with adaptations (“amber”), or not at all (“red”). 
The specific criteria are listed in Table 2.
We use descriptive statistics to examine teacher-
reported acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility 
of the implementation resource package. We then will 
conduct independent sample t tests to examine whether 
the intervention and control groups differ on baseline 
teacher and student outcomes.
To compare teacher use of the four behavioral class -
room interventions between the implementation strat -
egy and control group, we will estimate means, standard 
deviations (SD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 
observed teacher use of the four interventions and 
teacher global competence ratings. Similarly, to com -
pare child-level outcomes between the groups, we will 
estimate means, SDs, and 95% CI of child primary and 
secondary outcomes. We will examine baseline and 
post-intervention scores, as well as change scores. We 
will compute effect sizes for each outcome measure by 
calculating the difference in change scores for the imple -
mentation strategy versus control group between post 
intervention and baseline and dividing this amount by 
the pooled standard deviation of the change score for 
implementation strategy and control [26].
Although the study is not powered for significance 
testing, we will conduct exploratory analyses examining 
between-group differences. We will use multi-level lin -
ear models, implemented in HLM software, to account

for the nested data structure (i.e., students nested within 
teachers, nested within schools). We also will examine 
change in the measure of teacher intentions and teacher-
reported implementation barriers, and explore with 
regression analyses the extent to which these variables 
have the potential to mediate the effect of intervention 
on outcomes, consistent with the conceptual model for 
mediation [15]. These analyses will determine whether 
there is preliminary evidence to support changes in 
intentions and specific barriers as plausible mechanisms 
for the implementation strategy.
Discussion
The goal of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility 
and promise of the package of PBMIR, designed to help 
teachers strengthen student–teacher relationships and 
implement evidence-based behavioral classroom inter -
ventions, particularly for students with or at-risk for 
ADHD. If the pilot study results indicate that the PBMIR 
is acceptable, feasible and promising, this pilot study will 
provide the foundation for evaluating the PBMIR at a 
larger scale. Therefore, this research has the potential to 
ultimately lead to improved teacher effectiveness and stu -
dent outcomes. Because the research is being conducted 
in a large, urban school district that serves a predomi -
nantly marginalized and minoritized student body, and 
the PBMIR is designed to be appropriate, feasible, and 
sustainable to implement in this context, it also may be 
appropriate for other large, urban school districts. Given 
that children spend much of their time in the classroom 
setting, improving the implementation of evidence-based 
practices for children with or at-risk for ADHD in this 
context offers considerable promise for improving pop -
ulation-level mental health and promoting health equity.
There are several notable strengths to this project. The 
PBMIR were developed through an iterative, community-
partnered process, which is key to ensuring contextual 
appropriateness and feasibility [5, 18]. The implementa -
tion resource supports target practices that align with 
school-wide PBIS as implemented in the school district 
and uses terminology consistent with school and district 
initiatives. The PBMIR is informed by theory by target -
ing key constructs that shape individual’s intentions (i.e., 
attitudes, norms, self-efficacy) and their ability to act on 
intentions (i.e., habits, reminders); it was also informed 
by prior quantitative and qualitative data from teachers 
[20, 21]). The theory-driven, data-driven, and commu -
nity-partnered foundational work for this study improves 
the likelihood that the PBMIR will be effective, accepta -
ble, contextually appropriate, and feasible. We will collect 
data regarding both teacher implementation outcomes 
and student outcomes, using multiple methods (rating 
scale, direct observations) and informants (i.e., parent report, teacher report). Finally, we anticipate that the 
study will generate knowledge about potential mecha -
nisms for implementation strategies (e.g., habits) that 
may generalize beyond the context of behavioral class -
room interventions in schools.
We acknowledge several potential limitations, as well 
as potential practical or operational issues. First, the 
study is designed as a pilot study to establish feasibility 
and promise of the PBMIR and to lay the foundation for 
a larger scale trial; it is not powered for significance test -
ing. Because of this goal, we are collecting data on a large 
number of outcome measures, and therefore may be at 
risk for type I and type II errors. Second, there are consid -
erable challenges to participant recruitment, retention, 
and the implementation of research procedures in histor -
ically under-resourced schools. Many of these challenges 
have been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We therefore anticipate challenges with recruitment and 
data collection, and are planning approaches to minimize 
burden, promote engagement using incentives ethically, 
and ensure alignment with school and district priorities. 
We also note that we do not plan to collect child-report 
outcome measures, which could add valuable informa -
tion. Finally, we acknowledge that the PBMIR is designed 
as an individual, teacher-level implementation strategy, 
and does not target important school-level factors such 
as leadership and climate. School-level variability in these 
organizational factors may be important for the imple -
mentation and outcomes of the PBMIR, but the current 
study is not designed to examine these relationships, 
given the relatively small number of included schools.
If the pilot study results support the resource packages’ 
promise, the next step in this program of research would 
be to evaluate the PBMIR at a larger scale through an 
adequately-powered, randomized hybrid trial (i.e., a trial 
measuring both implementation outcomes and effec -
tiveness outcomes simultaneously, see [19]. This would 
enable us to more definitively assess the PBMIR’s effec -
tiveness regarding teacher implementation outcomes and 
student outcomes. Moreover, a larger scale trial would 
also support the examination of individual and organiza -
tional factors that serve as mediators and moderators of 
implementation outcomes.
