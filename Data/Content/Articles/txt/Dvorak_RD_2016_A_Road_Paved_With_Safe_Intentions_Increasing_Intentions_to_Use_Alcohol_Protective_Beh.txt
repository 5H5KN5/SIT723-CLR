Abstract
OBJECTIVE— Drinking remains a problem across college campuses. Changing this behavior 
requires interventions that can be easily and widely dispersed. Several theories place intentions as 
a proximal predictor of behavior change. The current study examines the effects of a web-based 
Deviance Regulation Theory (DRT) intervention on (1) intentions to use alcohol protective 
behavior strategies (PBS) and (2) associations between these intentions and actual behavior.
METHODS— Participants ( n = 76) completed a six-week, web-based, study examining drinking 
behaviors. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a positive frame about individuals who 
use PBS or a negative frame about individuals who do not. They also reported normative 
perceptions of PBS use among college students. They subsequently logged onto a secure server 
each week to report on alcohol involvement, use of three types of PBS (Manner of Drinking, 
Stopping/Limiting, and Serious Harm Reduction), and intentions to use these PBS the following 
week.
RESULTS— Consistent with DRT, negative frames resulted in higher PBS use intentions if 
individuals held high normative beliefs about PBS use. Positive frames resulted in higher Manner 
of Drinking PBS use intentions if individuals held low normative beliefs about PBS use, but only 
if individuals endorsed a high belief in the frame. In addition, there was a DRT consistent increase 
in intention-action associations, but only for Stopping/Limiting PBS.
DISCUSSION— A brief web-based DRT intervention was effective at increasing PBS intentions 
and increasing PBS intention-action associations. DRT may provide a mechanism to additively or 
synergistically improve other web-based interventions for college drinking.

Introduction
Heavy alcohol use is common among college students and has been associated with a 
number of problematic outcomes ( Hingson, Zha, & Weitzman, 2009 ). Recent findings from 
the Monitoring the Future study ( Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, Schulenberg, & Miech, 
2014 ) indicated that in 2013, 58% of college students reported having been drunk in the past 
year and 40% reported having been drunk in the past 30 days. Moreover, 35% of students 
reported having consumed five or more drinks at least once in the previous two weeks. 
Identifying factors that can reduce heavy use and alcohol-related consequences remains an 
important area of study. Research indicates using protective behavioral strategies while 
drinking can curtail alcohol-related consequences ( Pearson, 2013 ).
Protective Behavioral Strategies
Alcohol protective behavioral strategies (PBS) have been defined as “behaviors that 
individuals can engage in while drinking alcohol in order to limit negative alcohol-related 
consequences” ( Martens et al., 2004 , p. 390). Numerous cross-sectional studies have shown 
that greater use of PBS is associated with less alcohol use and fewer alcohol-related 
problems (for a review, see Pearson, 2013 ). Other studies have shown increases in PBS use 
mediate the effects of brief multi-component interventions on alcohol use ( Murphy et al., 
2012 ), although tests of stand-alone PBS-based interventions have been mixed ( Martens, 
Smith, & Murphy, 2013 ). To date, studies have not examined intention to use PBS in the 
context of alcohol.
Intention, Action, and the Intention-Action Gap
Behavioral intentions have formed a key component in several models of health behavior 
change. Two of the most prominent theories of behavior change, the Theory of Reasoned 
Action (TRA; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975 ) and its extension the Theory of Planned Behavior 
(TPB; Ajzen, 1991 ), assume that intentions are the most proximal predictor of reasoned 
action. However, intentions are not a perfect predictor of health behavior engagement 
(Armitage & Conner, 2001 ). In fact, Webb and Sheeran (2006)  found that medium-to-large 
changes in intentions are followed by small-to-medium changes in behavior. Additionally, a 
number of studies have failed to show that increases in intentions reliably predict increases 
in behavior (for a review see Sheeran, 2002 ). Gollwitzer (1999)  suggested that this may be 
due to a lack of goal directed behaviors that support the implementation of intentions. 
Consequently, interventions meant to affect behavior change require a two-stage process. 
First, the intervention must reliably increase intentions to engage in the behavior - the 
motivational  stage. Second, the intervention must allow for planned behaviors, often in the 
form of if-then  statements, meant to facilitate the intention-action link - the volitional  stage. 
Theories meant to change behavior must influence intentions in order to progress through 
the motivational stage. To address this issue we developed an intervention based on Dvorak et al. Page 2

Deviance Regulation Theory, a theory that has been reliably shown to increase behavioral 
intentions ( Blanton, Stuart, & Van den Eijnden, 2001 ).
Deviance Regulation Theory
Deviance Regulation Theory (DRT) offers a predictive model for behavioral intention and 
action grounded within the realms of social norms and message framing ( Blanton et al., 
2001 ). The basic precept is that individuals are influenced by different messages depending 
on their perceived normative levels of a given behavior in the population and the framing of 
messages. DRT predicts that intentions and behavior shift in order to allow individuals to 
stand out in a positive way, or distance themselves from standing out in a negative. Thus, 
messages intended to shift intentions for positive behaviors (e.g., protective behavior 
strategies) that are viewed as more common (i.e., high perceived norm), should be negatively 
framed by emphasizing the negatives of not engaging  in the behavior. Conversely, messages 
designed to shift intentions for positive behaviors that are viewed as less common should be 
positively framed by emphasizing the positives of engaging  in the behavior. Several studies 
have supported the basic DRT predictions for health related behavioral intentions ( Blanton et 
al., 2001 ); however, research on actual behavior change is more limited. Two recent studies 
have found evidence linking DRT to college student alcohol use ( Ferrer, Dillard, & Klein, 
2012 ; Lewis et al., 2010 ), though neither of these studies specifically tested the postulates of 
DRT. Recently, using this dataset, we found that this DRT-based intervention successfully 
modified PBS use among college student drinkers, which in turn decreased alcohol use and 
alcohol-related consequences ( Dvorak, Pearson, Neighbors, & Martens, 2015 ). However, we 
have not previously examined the effects of the intervention on intentions or the association 
between intentions and behavior.
Linking DRT to the Intention-Action Gap
DRT makes no specific predictions regarding how DRT-based interventions may affect the 
intention-action gap. However, motivational interviewing, a prominent intervention for 
behavior change, has suggested that increasing self-referent discrepancies decreases the 
intention-action gap ( W. R. Miller & Rollnick, 2013 ). This has been borne out in the 
literature, at least with regard to alcohol use ( McNally, Palfai, & Kahler, 2005 ). DRT is 
based on a model of self-referent discrepancy such that individuals evaluate themselves in 
the context of larger normative beliefs. Thus, we hypothesized DRT may affect behavior by 
(a) increasing health behavior intentions and (b) diminishing the intention-action gap.
Study Overview
The present study examines the efficacy of a brief, web-based intervention, grounded in 
DRT, among college student drinkers. Based on previous theory, the current analyses 
examined two specific research questions. First, does a DRT web-based intervention modify 
intentions to engage in PBS? We expected that when participants received a positive frame, 
there would be increases in PBS use intentions for those with low PBS use norms. For those 
who received a negative frame, we expected an increase in PBS use intentions for those with 
high PBS norms (see Figure 1, panel a). Second, does a DRT web-based intervention operate 
to change behavior by decreasing intention-action discrepancy? We expected that PBS use 
intentions would be positively associated with actual PBS use if individuals (a) held low Dvorak et al. Page 3

PBS norms and received a positive frame or (b) held high PBS norms and received a 
negative frame (see Figure 1, panel b). In addition, we examined the moderating effects of 
frame believability.
Method
Participants
Participants ( n = 76; 53.95% female) were college student drinkers recruited during spring 
2014 from the university psychology research subject pool for course credit. The sample 
ranged in age from 18–24 ( M = 19.29, SD = 1.42). Ninety-three percent of the sample was 
White, 3% Asian, and 3% were other or did not wish to respond.
Procedure
This study had two phases: a screening (Phase I) and intervention (Phase II) phase. In both 
phases participants completed an online informed consent. All surveys were administered 
anonymously via a secure online survey system. Participants completed surveys from their 
preferred personal computing locations (e.g., dorm rooms). In Phase I, screened participants 
(n = 207) completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, alcohol involvement, 
and use of PBS. Individuals endorsing alcohol use in the last six months ( n = 149) were 
invited to participate in Phase II. Among those invited, 45 opted out and 104 enrolled and 
completed at least the initial week of the intervention. Individuals who did not drink during 
the intervention ( n = 28) were removed from the analysis since PBS use is only relevant 
among those using alcohol (final analysis sample of n = 76). Once enrolled, participants 
logged onto a secure server and completed a weekly survey assessing alcohol and PBS use 
over the previous week and intentions to use PBS over the coming week. The NDSU IRB 
approved this study. Greater details of the intervention and the CONSORT diagram are 
reported elsewhere ( Dvorak et al., 2015 ).
Measures
Use of Protective Behavioral Strategies— PBS use was measured using the 15-item 
Protective Behavioral Strategies Survey (PBSS; Martens et al., 2005 ), which assesses three 
domains of PBS: Manner of Drinking (5 items; sample item: “Avoid trying to ‘keep up’ or 
out-drink others”), Serious Harm Reduction (3 items; sample item: “Make sure that you go 
home with a friend”), and Limiting/Stopping Drinking (7 items; sample item: “Alternate 
non-alcoholic beverages and alcoholic beverages”). Participants rated the frequency of each 
strategy used during the previous week on a five-point response scale (0 = never , 4 = 
always ). Previous research supports the reliability and validity of the PBSS among college 
students ( Martens et al., 2005 ). Internal consistencies across study weeks were acceptable 
(SLD: α = .63–.87; MD: α = .65–.79; SHR: α = .83–.90; Total PBS: α = .80–.90).
Intentions to use Protective Behavioral Strategies— Each week, following the 
rating of past week PBS use and the intervention reminder, participants were asked “How 
frequently do you PLAN  to engage in the following strategies over the NEXT WEEK ?” 
They then rated each of the 15 PBSS items on a five-point response scale (0 = never , 4 = 
always ). This served as the measure of intentions to use PBS over the next week. This was Dvorak et al. Page 4

assessed in week 0 (immediately after the initial intervention) as well as in weeks 1–6 of the 
study. Thus, there was a total of 7 weeks of intentions data. Internal consistencies of weekly 
intentions to use PBS were adequate in the current study (SLD: α = .93–.94; MD: α = .78–.
86; SHR: α = .89–.96; Total PBS: α = .94–.96).
Normative Use of Protective Behavioral Strategies— In the initial intervention week 
(i.e., week 0) participants were asked, “ What percent of NDSU students do you believe 
regularly engage in these strategies? ” Participants responded in a free text box. Participants 
were also asked this each week to examine possible changes in normative PBS use beliefs as 
a function of the intervention. To maintain consistency with previous DRT studies, and to 
increase ease of interpretation, this variable was dichotomized into high and low normative 
PBS beliefs (see data preparation section below).
Modified Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ-M)— The DDQ-M ( Dimeff, Baer, 
Kivlahan, & Marlatt, 1999 ) was used to assess alcohol consumption. The DDQ-M consists 
of a grid, with the days of the week and free-text boxes under each day. Participants entered 
the number of drinks consumed on each day over the previous week.
Frame Believability— Following the intervention statements (see below), participants 
were told: “ Sometimes, we tell people this research and they don't believe it. How much do 
you believe the above findings? ” They responded on a 5-point response scale (1 = not at all , 
5= absolutely believe ). Previous analyses have indicated framing belief affects the 
intervention effect, thus we included this variable as a covariate in the current analysis.
Intervention
Participants were randomly assigned to receive a positively or negatively framed message 
about individuals who do, or do not, use PBS. Participants were told: “ Here are some things 
we have found in our research at NDSU over the last few years. Please indicate if you knew 
this or not .” In the positive frame, participants were told: “ People who report that THEY DO 
USE these  strategies …” In the negative frame, participants were told: “ People who report 
that THEY DO NOT USE these strategies …” This frame was followed by a list of 12 
statements (sample positive frame: “… are viewed as more competent by their peers ”; 
sample negative frame: “…tend to be less conscientious ”). Participants responded by 
selecting: no I didn’t know, yes I knew , or do not wish to respond .
Analysis Overview
The primary analyses evaluated two outcomes as a function of the intervention: (1) PBS use 
intentions and (2) associations between PBS intentions and PBS use during drinking weeks. 
Analysis 2 used a reduced sample, as intentions to use PBS cannot predict PBS use if 
individuals do not drink. We dichotomized the PBS norms variable using a median split1, 
resulting in four groups: High PBS Norms/Negative Frame (HN/NF; n = 19), High PBS 
1We also examined PBS norms as a continuous moderator. In analysis 1, the three-way interactions differed slightly for MD PBS 
(Interaction using median split p = .02 vs. Interactions using continuous moderator p = .03) and SLD PBS (Interaction using median 
split p = .05 vs. Interactions using continuous moderator p = .06). However, for the HR PBS there was a marked difference with the 
three-way interaction being non-significant using the median split ( p = .339), but much more robust using a continuous moderator ( p Dvorak et al. Page 5

Norms/Positive Frame (HN/PF; n = 18), Low PBS Norms/Negative Frame (LN/NF; n = 19), 
and Low PBS Norms/Positive Frame (LN/PF; n = 20). Primary hypotheses were tested in 
Mplus 7.3 using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors. One Level-1 
intercept had no random variance, and was constrained to zero (see Table 3). All other 
intercepts were allowed to vary randomly. Variance components of Level 1 slopes were not 
significant and thus fixed to zero. For both analyses, between-subjects variables were grand-
mean centered while within-subjects variables (including time in analysis 1) were subject-
mean centered.
Results
Descriptive, univariate, bivariate, and compliance statistics
Descriptive and bivariate statistics of between-subjects data are listed in Table 1. Across all 
PBS scales, intentions and use of PBS were positively correlated. Alcohol use was inversely 
correlated with all intentions and use of PBS scales, though not all reached statistical 
significance. Number of weeks in the study was positively correlated with intentions and use 
of all PBS subscales. Women endorsed greater intentions to use all three types of PBS as 
well as higher actual use of MD PBS. Women also reported less average alcohol 
consumption than men. PBS norms were associated with higher PBS intentions and higher 
PBS use across all subscales.
There were a total of 386 post-intervention person-weeks out of total possible 456 person 
weeks (i.e., 76 participants × 6 weeks) resulting in an overall participation rate of 84.65%. 
Individuals participated for an average of 5.18 weeks ( SD = 1.13; Range: 2–6) including 
baseline data collection (i.e., week 0). Participants provided up to seven weeks of intentions 
data ( M = 6.18 , SD = 1.12), as intentions to use PBS during week 7 were assessed in the 
final week (week 6) of the study. On drinking weeks ( n = 244) in the analysis (i.e., weeks 
with data for PBS use, PBS use intentions, and alcohol use), participants consumed an 
average of 7.13 drinks per week ( SD = 4.81; Range: 1–21). An ANOV A of mean total PBS 
use the week prior to the intervention indicated a significant effect of perceived PBS use 
norm group, F(1, 72) = 4.66, p = .034, d = 0.49, but no differences by DRT frame ( F[1, 72] = 
1.11, p = .296) or the interaction of DRT frame × PBS norm group ( F[1, 72] = 0.78, p = .
380).
Protective Behavioral Strategies: Intentions
Using a multilevel framework, we examined mean intentions (i.e., intercept) as well as 
changes in intentions across seven weeks (i.e., slope) among all three PBS subtypes as a 
function of time (level 1), DRT frame (level 2), PBS norms (level 2), and belief in the DRT 
frame (level 2). The following multilevel equation was specified:
Level 1: PBS Use Intentions ti = π0i + π1i(Week of Study ti) + eti
= .003). In analysis 2, the two-way interactions on the slope for MD PBS and SLD PBS both became less robust, and in fact were not 
statistically signifcant, when using a continuous moderator. The two-way interaction on the slope for HR PBS was again more robust 
using the continuous moderator relative to the median split (though only slightly). None of the tested three-way interactions were 
significant using the continuous moderator in analysis 2. In all cases the direction of effects was consistent. Complete data and 
analysis code are available from the first author upon request.Dvorak et al. Page 6

PBS Norm Group) + B15(Frame Belief × PBS Norm Group) + B16(Frame × Frame 
Belief) + B17(Frame × Frame Belief × PBS Norm Group)
We examined the same model for each of the three PBS subtypes. At Level 1, Week of 
Study, t, was the week of the study for person i. At level 2, we examined the effects of DRT 
frame, PBS use norms, belief in the frame, and interactions among the latter three variables 
on the intercept and slope for each PBS. Table 2 depicts the results of these models.
Stopping/Limiting Drinking (SLD)— There was a significant effect of DRT (frame × 
PBS norm) on the SLD PBS use intentions across time ( B = 0.150, p = .036). Examination 
of the simple time slopes for each DRT condition revealed that the slopes were consistent 
with DRT, but did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (HN/NF: B = 
0.047, p = .123, HN/PF: B = −0.014, p = .753, LN/NF: B = −0.037, p = .293, LN/PF: B = 
0.051, p = .082). There was also a significant interaction of DRT frame × frame belief on the 
time slope that did not vary by PBS norms ( B = 0.144, p = .003). At +1 SD frame belief, 
neither the positive ( B = −0.054, p = .118) nor negative ( B = 0.031, p = .333) frames were 
associated with change in SLD PBS use intentions across time. Paradoxically, at -1 SD frame 
belief there was an increase in intentions to use SLD PBS among those who received a 
positive frame ( B = 0.093, p = .025) but not among those who received a negative frame ( B 
= −0.023, p = .427). PBS use norms were strongly associated with mean SLD PBS use 
intentions. There was a marginal effect of frame × PBS norms on the SLD PBS intercept ( B 
= 0.754, p = .051) that did not vary by belief in the DRT frame, see panel a of Figure 2. 
Examination of this interaction indicated no difference in SLD PBS among those with low 
PBS norms ( B = 0.223, p = .468). However, at high PBS norms, individuals who received a 
negative frame had significantly higher SLD PBS use intentions ( B = 0.531, p = .031).
Serious Harm Reduction (SHR)— There were no effects of DRT on the SHR PBS use 
intentions across time. PBS norms were positively associated with mean SHR PBS use 
intentions. There was a significant interaction of PBS norms × DRT frame on the SHR PBS 
use intentions intercept ( B = 0.743, p = .043) that did not vary by frame belief, see panel b of 
Figure 2. Among those with low PBS norms, there was no effect of DRT frame ( B = −0.326, 
p = .289). However, among those with high PBS norms a negative frame resulted in higher 
SHR PBS use intentions ( B = 0.417, p = .043).
Manner of Drinking (MD)— There was a significant effect of DRT (PBS norms × frame) 
on the MD PBS use intentions across time ( B = 0.136, p = .019). Examination of the simple 
time slopes for each DRT condition revealed that the slopes were again consistent with DRT, 
but did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (HN/NF: B = 0.040, p = .072, 
HN/PF: B = −0.021, p = .481, LN/NF: B = −0.050, p = .137, LN/PF: B = 0.025, p = .387). 
There was also a significant frame × belief in the frame interaction on the MD PBS time Dvorak et al. Page 7

slope that did not vary by PBS norms. At -1 SD frame belief, neither the positive ( B = 0.049, 
p = .149) nor negative ( B = −0.027, p = .417) frames were associated with change in MD 
PBS use intentions across time. Similar to above, there was a paradoxical effect, though this 
time at +1 SD Frame belief. At high frame belief there was a marginal decrease in intentions 
to use MD PBS among those who received a positive frame ( B = −0.043, p = .068) but not 
among those who received a negative frame ( B = 0.014, p = .631). PBS use norms were also 
associated with mean MD PBS use intentions. Finally, there was a significant effect of the 
DRT intervention on mean MD PBS use intentions that varied by frame belief ( B = 1.109, p 
= .018). At low levels of frame belief there were no differences in MD PBS use intentions 
among those with high ( B = 0.210, p = .553) or low ( B = 0.463, p = .228) norms. However, 
at high levels of frame belief there were DRT consistent differences in mean MD PBS use 
intentions, see Figure 3. In the low norms group, a positive frame resulted in higher MD 
PBS use intentions ( B = 0.797, p = .011). In contrast, at high norms a negative frame 
resulted in higher MD PBS use intentions ( B = 0.502, p = .025).
Protective Behavioral Strategies: Intention-Action Associations
Next we examined the effects of the DRT intervention on associations between intentions to 
use PBS and actual PBS use during drinking weeks ( n = 244 weeks). We initially estimated 
a model that examined variation in the DRT effect as a function of frame belief. However, 
none of the intention slopes were predicted by the PBS norms × DRT frame × frame belief 
interaction. Thus, we removed this interaction. The following multilevel equation was 
specified:
Level 1: PBS Use ti = π0i + π1i(PBS use intentions (t−1)i) + π2i(Weekly Alcohol Use ti) + 
eti
Level 2: π0i = B00 + B01(Gender) + B02(Age) + B03(Mean Alcohol Use) + B04(Mean 
PBS Intentions) + B05(Frame) + B06(PBS Norm Group) + B07(Frame Belief) + 
B08(Frame × PBS Norm Group) + u0i
π1i = B10+ B11(Gender) + B12(Age) + B13(Frame) + B14(PBS Norm Group) + 
B15(Frame Belief) + B16(Frame × PBS Norm Group)
π2i = B20
We examined the same model for each of the three PBS subtypes. At Level 1, PBS use was 
actual use of PBS during week t for person i. Weekly alcohol use was drinks consumed 
during week t for person i. PBS use intentions were intentions to use PBS next week 
(reported during week t-1, the week prior to the actual PBS use) for person i. We controlled 
for the association between PBS use and alcohol use during week t for person i. At level 2, 
we examined the effects of frame, PBS norms, and the PBS norms × frame interaction on the 
intercepts and slopes for all PBS subtypes. We controlled for between-subjects alcohol use 
and PBS intentions (using variance parsed across levels). Results of the analysis, for each 
PBS subtype, is presented in Table 3. Table 4 lists the specific PBS intention-action 
associations across conditions.
Stopping/limiting Drinking— SLD PBS intentions were associated with PBS use at both 
the within- and between-subjects level. Mean SLD PBS use was higher in the high PBS Dvorak et al. Page 8

norms group, among men, and among older participants. There was a significant interaction 
of PBS norms × frame on the SLD PBS intention slope. Table 4 shows there were no 
associations between intentions and behavior in the LN/NF or the HN/PF groups. However, 
in the LN/PF and the HN/NF groups, intentions predicted use of PBS the following week. 
Thus, intentions predicted SLD PBS use in a DRT consistent manner.
Manner of Drinking— MD PBS intentions were associated with PBS use at the between- 
but not within-subjects level. There was a significant PBS norms × frame interaction on the 
MD PBS intention slope. The observed slopes across conditions were directionally 
consistent with DRT, though none reached conventional levels of statistical significance.
Serious Harm Reduction— SHR PBS intentions were associated with PBS use at both 
the within- and between-subjects level. PBS norms were positively associated with SHR 
PBS use. There was a significant interaction of PBS norms × frame on the SHR PBS 
intention slope, that took a different form than the previous two PBS interactions. In the 
LN/NF there was a positive association between intentions and actual use of SHR PBS. 
Intentions did not predict behavior in the other three groups; though, directionally the 
associations appeared opposite to DRT prediction. The intention-action association was also 
moderated by gender, with SHR intentions predicting SHR use for women ( B = 0.359, p = .
011) but not for men ( B = −0.044, p = .493).
Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to examine a DRT web-based intervention targeting 
use of alcohol PBS. Specifically, we examined whether this intervention was able to increase 
intentions to use PBS and strengthen intention-action associations. Although most DRT 
studies have used intentions as the focal outcome, the original formulations of DRT do not 
specifically mention how intentions or the intention-action gap may be related to how social 
influence can result in behavior change. Based on other literature (e.g., W. R. Miller & 
Rollnick, 2013 ), we hypothesized DRT would both increase PBS intentions and decrease the 
intention-action gap.
Although the specific main and interaction effects that were statistically significant varied 
across the models, the direction of effects on PBS use intentions was consistent with DRT. 
Specifically, the negative frame resulted in higher intentions to use all types of PBS among 
individuals with high PBS norms. In contrast, the positive frame resulted in higher intentions 
to use all types of PBS among individuals with low PBS norms. These effects do not appear 
to increase or decay over at least six weeks.
In terms of the intention-action gap, the predicted interaction between PBS norms and frame 
was consistent with DRT for two types of PBS: Stopping/Limiting Drinking PBS and 
Manner of Drinking PBS. Specifically, the associations between PBS use intentions and 
actual PBS use was strongest for individuals who reported low PBS norms and received the 
positive frame or who reported high PBS norms and received the negative frame. Thus, 
individuals showed increased week-to-week intentions to use PBS as well as stronger 
associations between their PBS use intentions and actual PBS use. However, we also found Dvorak et al. Page 9

an interaction that was opposite of prediction for Serious Harm Reduction PBS. Individuals 
with low perceived norms, who received a negative frame, showed a significant positive 
association between PBS use intentions and actual PBS use. These individuals showed the 
lowest intentions to use Serious Harm Reduction PBS and subsequently had the lowest 
actual PBS use. The three distinct PBS that form the Serious Harm Reduction PBS subscale 
are each tightly constrained based on the drinking milieu. For example, one can only “use a 
designated driver” if transportation by car is necessary, and one can only “go home with a 
friend” if drinking socially with a friend. Thus, the observed increase in intentions to use 
Serious Harm Reduction PBS may not have resulted in a decrease in the intention-action gap 
as use of these strategies may not have been an option during the drinking week. 
Alternatively, given the relatively modest effects throughout, and our small sample, this 
association may be spurious. This remains an important question for future research.
Theoretical Implications
Several health behavior models have behavioral intentions as a proximal antecedent to actual 
behavior. Intentions are considered the most proximal antecedent to behavior according to 
the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991 ) and the most proximal antecedent of 
“reasoned” behaviors in the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM; Gerrard et al., 2008). 
Interestingly, despite the fact that most DRT studies have assessed behavioral intentions 
rather than actual behavior as the primary outcome, DRT is quite silent with regards to how 
behavioral intentions play a prominent role in mediating behavior change as a result of the 
social influence processes described by this theory. Other prominent theories have focused 
more explicitly on understanding when intentions are more or less likely to predict behavior. 
For example, Gollwitzer’s (1999)  work on implementation intentions demonstrates that 
having a goal intention (i.e., having the goal to use PBS) is often insufficient to produce 
follow-through with this goal. With their meta-analysis, Gollwitzer and Sheeran (2006) 
show that the use of implementation intentions (or action planning) can strengthen the 
association between intentions and behavior. Implementation intentions are subordinate to 
an overall behavioral intention and clearly specify the when, where, and how of a behavioral 
intention in the form of an if-then  statement. Our results demonstrated that a DRT-based 
intervention increased intentions to use three distinct types of PBS and at least for two of 
these PBS, produced an increased likelihood of following through with intentions. This latter 
finding is new and potentially very important. It means that this approach not only increases 
motivation to change, but crucially, makes this change more  likely. We can only speculate 
how this simple intervention worked to close the intention-action gap. However, it is 
possible that increasing PBS use intentions led participants to engage in improved action 
planning. Overall, our results suggest the associations between intentions and behavior 
warrant further attention in testing the predictions of DRT.
Clinical Implications
Not only were the results from the present study generally consistent with DRT predictions, 
but we also demonstrated the efficacy of a simple DRT grounded web-based intervention. 
Despite the prevalence of norms-based interventions for college student drinking ( M. B. 
Miller et al., 2013 ), these interventions are nearly entirely focused on providing personalized 
normative feedback in order to decrease perceived drinking norms. These interventions seem Dvorak et al. Page 10
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 June 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
to be based on the assumption that individuals universally wish to conform to the norm. 
DRT posits that individuals at times want to conform to the norm, but at other times want to 
deviate from the norm. Rather than manipulating normative beliefs themselves, this DRT-
based intervention demonstrates the promise of giving targeted messages that capitalize on 
pre-existing normative beliefs. Importantly, such messaging is not typically found in college 
student alcohol interventions but could be easily given and tailored based on normative 
beliefs.
Though there is considerable research supporting the efficacy of web-based normative 
interventions ( M. B. Miller et al., 2013 ), there is also research indicating that web-based 
normative interventions do not always work as predicted ( Bewick et al., 2010 ). The use of 
message framing may assist in these instances. The present findings suggest that 
appropriately framed messages could be delivered following normative feedback designed to 
change normative beliefs. This is a fairly novel approach, especially for drinkers who may 
not hold extremely high beliefs about alcohol use norms. Thus, personalized normative 
feedback designed to decrease perceived drinking norms could be combined with a 
positively framed message about individuals who drink normatively, and personalized 
normative feedback designed to increase the perceived use of PBS could be combined with a 
negatively framed message about individuals who do not use PBS. There are many 
unexplored opportunities to integrate and tailor messages to college students receiving 
traditional norm-based interventions. The ability to provide this intervention content via the 
web circumvents several implementation barriers associated with face-to-face interventions, 
further highlighting the promise of DRT-informed interventions.
Limitations
Despite the strengths of the present study, there are several limitations that should be noted. 
First, our sample size was rather small considering that we were examining two- and three-
way interactions between DRT frame, PBS norms, and belief in the DRT frame. For 
example, we only had 18–20 subjects per DRT frame × PBS norms condition. Thus, we only 
had sufficient sample size to detect medium-to-large effects. Consequently, many of the 
effects we observed did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance; though, they 
often showed theoretically consistent patterns. Second, we assessed PBS norms using a one-
item measure of the percentage of college students at the participating university who use 
PBS. Although we used this single measure to capture overall PBS norms, we examined 
three distinct types of PBS in our analyses. Thus, our overall PBS norms measure lacked 
precision, and future studies should use more comprehensive assessments of PBS norms. In 
addition, we did not explicitly examine effects on alcohol use or problems. Future research 
could explore the effects of intention-action associations on more clinically relevant 
outcomes.2 Finally, individuals in this study were relatively well-adapted adults, drinking at 
relatively nonhazardous levels. Thus, it remains to be seen if this intervention would be 
effective among more problematic drinkers.
2In the present manuscript, we limit the analyses to intentions and intention-behavior associations for PBS so as not to overlap with 
previously reported results. However, it is possible that the strength of the intention-action gap may influence alcohol use (and 
subsequently problems). Therefore, we examined this possibility using the weekly intention-action slopes as predictors of alcohol use 
and problems. The effects were theoretically consistent, though did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.Dvorak et al. Page 11

Conclusion
Although the old adage “the road to hell is paved with good intentions” may be coopted to 
rather keenly to describe the intention-action gap, the path to safe drinking may very well be 
paved with safe intentions. We found that a brief web-based intervention based on DRT was 
effective at both increasing PBS use intentions and increasing the predictive utility of PBS 
use intentions in determining actual PBS use (for two of three types of PBS). Further 
investigation of whether DRT and other norms-based intervention approaches close the 
intention-action gap is warranted to not only explain a potential mechanism through which 
such interventions achieve behavior change, but also to consider how to best integrate other 
interventions that may additively or synergistically improve intervention efficacy (e.g., 
normative feedback, action planning). In the context of the present study’s limitations, we 
consider our results as both preliminary and promising. Future studies aiming to directly and 
conceptually replicate these findings are needed to determine the robustness of the observed 
effects.
