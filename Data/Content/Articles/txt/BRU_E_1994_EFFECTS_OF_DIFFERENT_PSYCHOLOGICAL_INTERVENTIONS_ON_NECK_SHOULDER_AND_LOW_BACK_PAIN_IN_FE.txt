One hundred and eleven females volunteered to take part in this intervention study of musculoskeletal 
pain. They all completed a survey of pain among five hundred and eighty-six female hospital staff and 
presented mild to severe pain in the neck, shoulder and/or low back. They were randomly assigned to 
one of the following groups; Focus on job-stress and psychosocial coping (Cognitive), relaxation training 
(Relaxation), the combination of the two (Combined) or to a control group (Control). Musculoskeletal 
pain (intensity and duration) was assessed by self-report prior to interventions, immediately after inter- 
ventions, and at a four months follow-up. Results from multivariate analyses of variance as well as 
covariance (pre-intervention levels of pain as covariate) showed that magnitude of pain reduction was 
dependent upon the interaction between area of the back and type of intervention. These trends were 
more significant for intensity than for duration scores. They were due to reductions of pain in (1) neck 
and shoulders for the Cognitive and Combined groups and (2) in the low back and shoulders for the 
Relaxation group. The four month follow-up assessment revealed a significant risk of relapse only for 
duration of low back pain among subjects in the Combined group. Results from the Cognitive approach 
to intervention may reflect a causal role for ability to cope with psychosocial job stress in the development 
of neck and shoulder pain in female hospital staff.

INTRODUCTION 
The high incidence of skeletal muscle pain has attracted increasing concern in indus- 
trialised societies and has provoked a search for improved intervention procedures 
(see, e.g., Bergenudd and Nilsson, 1988; Lee et al., 1985; Tellnes, 1989; Tellnes 
et al., 1989). The present research is part of a Norwegian programme that has 
addressed this challenge. A preliminary review of findings from this programme is 
reported by Ursin et al. (in press). 
Psychological factors are believed to play a significant part in the development

of musculoskeletal pain. Winkel and Westgaard (1992) concluded that psychososial 
factors, individual characteristics and physical workload were related to neck, 
shoulder and low back pain, with only a few exceptions. Reviewing a broader range 
of risk factors Riihimaki (1991) identified six studies reporting associations between 
psychosocial work factors and low back pain. Ursin, Endresen and Ursin (1988) 
found associations between psychological factors and both neck, shoulder/arms and 
low back pain. However, Westgaard and Jansen (1992a) found significant relation- 
ships only between psychological problems and pain in the head and neck region, 
whereas no such associations were found for pain in other body areas. Svebak 
et al. (1991) reported stronger associations between (a) psychological factors, such 
as exposure to stressors, coping efforts and negative moods, and (b) neck and shoul- 
der pain, as compared with low back pain. 
It is commonly found that muscle tonus can be elevated as well as reduced 
by psychological events (see e.g. Apter and Svebak, 1986; Jacobson, 1932; 1938; 
Malmo, 1965; Svebak, 1988; Waersted, Bjebrklund and Westgaard, 1991). It is possi- 
ble that long lasting elevation in muscle tonus, caused by psychological events, 
might lead to musculoskeletal pain (Sejersted and Vollestad, 1993). 
Several psychological treatment approaches have been developed to address the 
problem of chronic back pain (see Turk and Flor, 1984, for a review). Relaxation 
training is a commonly used psychological technique for the reduction of this kind 
of pain. The cognitive-behavioural approach to treatment of pain is a more recent 
development. According to Turk and Flor (1984) several studies show promising 
results for this latter approach. However, findings are not conclusive (see also Sailis 
el al., 1987). Cognitive-behavioural treatments often include different components; 
e.g. the teaching of skills for more effective handling of psychosocial job demands, 
stress management via identification and modification of maladaptive cognitions 
and the teaching of relaxation. According to Turk and Flor (1984). more research 
is needed to examine the contributions of the various components of the cognitive- 
behavioural approach to treatment. 
In this study we compared the effect of a (A) cognitive-behavioural approach 
(focus on improving skills for handling psychosocial job demands: Cognitive) with 
(B) relaxation training (Relaxation) where the procedure had a specific focus on the 
reduction of tension in skeletal muscles of the neck, shoulder and low back pain. 
We also included (C) a combination of the two approaches (Combined) to examine 
possible synergy effects of the combined approach. 
METHOD AND MATERIAL 
Subjects 
Five hundred and eighty-six female hospital staff participated in the initial screening 
that recruited participants with varying degrees of skeletal muscIe pain from neck, 
shoulders and/or low back into the intervention study. These subjects were recruited 
to meet several criteria including gender (only females), different professions 
INTERVENTIONS ON BACK PAIN 373 
(medical doctors, registered nurses, auxiliary nurses, laboratory staff, kitchen staff), 
and availability (excluding e.g. staff working in sterile environments). Thirty-nine 
subjects were excluded from the intervention study due to diagnoses based upon 
medical screening (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Bechterew’s disease, epilepsy, previous 
surgery to the spine, osteoporosis, breast cancer, fibromyalgia, pregnancy). 
One hundred and sixty-eight subjects with relatively severe pains were offered 
an oppurtunity to participate in one of the three different procedures for treat- 
ment of musculoskeletal back pain. This sub-sample of subjects met a criterion that 
included (a) reported pain in the neck, shoulder and/or low back over the last seven 
days and that had caused leave of absence for some period over the last twelve 
months (see section on assessment of musculoskeletal complaints, below). In 
addition (b), back pain had to be reported for at least two periods over the last six 
months. 
Subjects were randomly assigned to the three intervention procedures with a 
fourth sub-group defined as a ‘waiting-list’ Control group. One hundred and nine- 
teen subjects (71 %) volunteered to take part and were pre-tested for neck, shoulder 
and low back pain. One hundred and eleven subjects (66%) completed the proce- 
dures: Cognitive: N = 19, mean age = 37.7, SD = 9.55, range = 24-53; Relaxa- 
tion: N = 15, mean age = 40.4, SD = 9.73, range = 22-55; Combined: N = 24, 
mean age = 36.7, SD = 10.33, range = 24-53; Control: N = 53, mean age = 36.5, 
SD = 8.36 range = 23-57. 
Assessment of musculoskeletal pain 
The initial screening of musculoskeletal pain was made by use of self-report using 
a section of the extensive Nordic Questionnaire for the analysis of musculoskeletal 
symptoms (NQ: see Kourinka et al., 1987, upper section of page 235). The validity 
and reliability of the NQ has been reported to be adequate (Kourinka el al., 1987). 
From this form, scores on neck, shoulder and low back pain over the last twelve 
months were combined with information on sick leave, level of pain over the last 
seven days as well as number of complaint periods within the last six months (see 
subject section, above, on recruitment criteria). 
Pre-treatment baseline assessment of musculoskeletal pain made use of a more 
focused scale than the NQ, developed by Westgaard and Jansen (1992b) who also 
reported data on validity and reliability. Five levels of intensity are assessed in this 
scale as related to the last thirty days: 
0 = No complaint; 
1 = Almost no complaints, only slight feeling of discomfort at breaks, when 
not concentrating on the work task; 
2 = Slight, but noticeable complaints when performing the work tasks. 
However, these are of sufficiently low intensity not to interfere with performance 
at work; 
3 = Relatively strong complaints during work, making it necessary to maintain 
314 E. BRU ETAL. 
a conscious effort in order to carry out the work tasks. It is necessary at times 
to have breaks due to the discomfort experienced. The feelings of discomfort are 
relieved following such breaks; 
4 = It is difficult to carry out work because of the complaints. The feelings of 
discomfort are not fully relieved following such breaks. 
This scale was combined with assessment of duration of pain over the last thirty 
days, using a four-step format like in the Ursin Health Inventory (see Ursin, et al., 
1988): 
0 = No period with pain over the last 30 days; 
1 = Pain over 1 to 10 days; 
2 = Pain over 11 to 20 days; 
3 = Pain over 21 to 30 days. 
The scale was applied to the neck, shoulder and low back areas, respectively. The 
scales for assessment of intensity and duration of musculoskeletal pain were admin- 
istered three times: (1) Before interventions started (Pre), (2) immediately after 
interventions ended (Post-1) and (3) at a follow-up assessment session four months 
after the interventions ended (Post-2). 
The Intervention Procedures 
Cognitive 
This intervention procedure provided education on relationships between per- 
sonality, work environment, and musculoskeletal pain. One important aspect of the 
training was to help the participant to cope better with occupational demands (e.g. 
by way of a more conscious distinction between demands with different priorities). 
Another was the teaching of effective strategies for interpersonal communication. 
The Cognitive intervention focused also upon helping participants to appraise 
potentially threatening situations in a positive way. The procedure relied heavily 
upon the participants’ ability to identify their own coping resources and to actively 
seek out ways of using these resources through group discussions. Data from a 
previous local study on relationships between personality, job environment and 
musculoskeletal pain were used as input to these sessions. Main issues of the pro- 
gram were (1) job-stressors, appraisal, and coping, (2) effects of stress on cognitive 
functioning and behaviour, (3) personality and musculoskeletal pain, (4) motiva- 
tional state and musculoskeletal pain, (5) psychological defence and musculo- 
skeletal pain, (6) the use of self instructions to moderate emotional arousal, and 
(7) strategies for better communication and self-assertion. All these issues were 
primarily related to the job-situations. The procedure included ten sessions of two 
hours each. 
Relaxation 
This procedure included progressive relaxation (Jacobson, 1938) and autogenic 
training (Schultz and Luthe, 1969) that was practised by playback of a 30-minute 
INTERVENTIONS ON BACK PAIN 315 
audio-taped instruction including both relaxation techniques. In addition, the 
participants met in groups for ten one and a half hours sessions where 30 minutes 
were spent on practice of relaxation, with the rest of the session spent on discussion 
of experiences with the relaxation procedures. Three additional sessions were inter- 
spersed across these ten sessions to provide simple biofeedback-assisted relaxation 
training by use of integrated EMG power out-put transduced from the frontalis 
muscle. 
Corn bined 
One intervention procedure combined the cognitive intervention and relaxation 
training in shortened versions. This program included ten sessions of two hours 
each. The first one and a half hours were used for the Cognitive approach, and 
it was followed by half an hour spent on relaxation training. In this way the allo- 
cation of time to the two components was asymmetrical to reflect a typical time 
period for the administration of relaxation, and to allow for elements of cognitive 
treatment to be adequately implemented as a discussion-oriented type of group 
intervention. 
Control 
The Control group was kept on a ‘waiting-list’ arrangement that meant these 
subjects were promised participation in some intervention procedure at a later time. 
Procedure 
All sessions were given during working hours. For part-time workers it was not 
always possible to give sessions during working hours and, therefore, they were paid 
to compensate for extra time spent on participation in some sessions. The proce- 
dures and assessment sessions were administered in cooperation with staff from the 
Occupational Health Unit. The procedures were implemented by the first and third 
authors. Participants in the active intervention procedures were given ‘homework’ 
with practice in abilities acquired during sessions. They were all instructed not to 
discuss the content of sessions with individuals outside their group and, for subjects 
on relaxation training, not to hand out copies of audio-tapes to others. For ethical 
reasons the subjects in the Control group were given a physical training intervention 
immediately after the first post-test. Follow-up testing of the Control group is there- 
fore not reported in this paper. 
Data Scoring and Statistical Analyses 
Assessment of intensity of pain made use of a five-step interval scale ranging from 
no pain to severe pain, and values zero through four were assigned respectively to 
these levels of pain. Duration of pain was assessed by a four-level scale ranging from 
no duration to thirty days of duration, Values zero through three were assigned to 
the increasing levels of duration (see above for details). 
Effects of treatments on neck, shoulder and low back pain were tested by use 
376 E. BRU ET AL. 
of the MANOVA-program of the SPSSPC-package (Norusis, 1986), treating data 
as doubly multivariate, and with repeated measures and pain sites as within-subject 
factors. In addition, MANCOVAs with pre-test scores as the covariate were per- 
formed to control for possible confounding effects caused by differences between 
treatment groups already existing in the preintervention period. Dependent variables 
in the MANCOVAs were difference-scores between Pre- and Post 1 -tests: Pre-test 
scores were used as covariates. Finally, within-group changes from Pre to Post-1 
and from Post-1 to Post-2 were tested with pair-wise t-tests.

YI RESULTS

0 Control Pre-test assessment showed a concentration of subjects with ‘moderate’ intensity of 
pain from neck and shoulders (Figure 1). Subjects with low back pain showed pre- 
test scores that were evenly distributed from ‘no pain’ to ‘strong’ level of pain in 
all subject groups. However, the Combined group showed a positive skewness with 
higher percentage of subjects in the ‘moderate’ and ‘strong’ levels of low back pain. 
Compared to the Pre-test, Post-1 showed a general change towards bimodality of 
pain levels with concentrations of scores on ‘no pain’ and moderate pain levels for 
neck and shoulders. Post-2 scores showed the same pattern as that of Post-1.

between treatments and the three back areas were tested by multivariate analyses 
of variance (MANOVA), treating data as repeated measures in time (T) with back 
areas (A) as an additional within subject factor. Changes in intensity of pain were 
significantly different for the neck, shoulder and low back areas from Pre to Post-1 
(T x A: see Table 1). Moreover, for intensity of pain a significant three-way inter- 
action emerged between type of intervention (I), time and pain area (I x T x A). 
This effect was due to a reduction in intensity of neck pain for the Cognitive and 
Combined groups, whereas intensity of low back pain was reduced for the Relaxa- 
tion group (see Figure 2). For duration of pain there was a similiar but only mar- 
ginally significant tendency. Differences in pain between interventions (I) were 
significant for duration but only marginally significant for intensity. There was a 
significant change in pain levels for duration scores from Pre to Post-1 (T) indepen- 
dent of interventions or areas. 
Confounding effects may have been due to somewhat different pain mean scores 
between groups before interventions. A MANCOVA was therefore performed with 
difference-scores between Pre and Post- 1 as dependent variables and prescores as 
covariates (see Table 2). The results from the MANCOVAs yielded significant F- 
score for differences between interventions (I) in changes for intensity as well as 
duration scores from Pre to Post-1. This approach to the interaction of areas and 
interventions yielded more significant results for intensity scores than did the 
MANOVAs (Table 1). The interaction between intervention and area (I x A) was 
only marginally significant for scores reflecting duration of pain. In this way, the 
MANCOVA results supported the main trends of the MANOVAs presented in 
Table 1. 
Differential effects of interventions were also tested without the inclusion of the 
Table 1 Multivariate analyses of variance for intensity and duration of musculoskeletal pain in three 
areas of the back (neck, shoulder, low back) assessed at two times (Pre. Post-1) in four intervention 
groups of subjects (Cognitive, Relaxation, Combined, Control; see text for details).

control group of subjects (see Table 3). Results from these MANCOVAs confirmed 
significant interactions between type of interventions and areas (I x A) for intensity 
of pain scores. The interaction between type of intervention and area (I x A) was 
also significant for duration of pain scores. Changes in mean pain scores are 
illustrated in Figure 2 and showed that these effects were due to reductions in 
intensity as well as, duration of neck pain for the Cognitive and Combined groups, 
whereas, intensity and duration of low back pain were reduced in the Relaxation 
group. 
Pair-wise comparisons of changes given in Figure 2 showed a significant reduction 
in intensify of neck pain for the Cognitive and Combined groups from Pre to Post-1 
(r = 2.63, p = .017; t = 3.81, p = .001, respectively), while scores for intensity of 
neck pain for the Relaxation group remained fairly unchanged. In contrast, the 
Relaxation group showed the most apparent reduction in intensify of low back pain 
from Pre to Post-1 (f = 2.98, p = .010). For intensity of shoulder pain the Cogni- 
tive, Combined and Relaxation groups all showed significant reduction from Pre 
to Post-1 (t = 3.28,~ = .004; t = 2.61, p = .016; t = 3.29, p = .005, respectively).

Figure 2 Mean scores for muscle pain at pre-intervention (Pre), end of intervention (Postl) and four 
months after end of intervention (Post2) in four different subject groups. (Note that the Control group 
is excluded from Post2.) 
Reductions in duration of neckpain from Pre to Post-1 were significant for the 
Cognitive and Combined groups (r = 2.63, p = .017; t = 2.33, p = .029), whereas 
duration of neck pain appeared to be unchanged for the Relaxation group. The 
duration of low back pain was significantly reduced for the Relaxation group 
(I = 3.06, p = .009). In contrast, scores for duration of low back pain remained 
unchanged for the Cognitive and Combined groups. For duration of shoulder pain 
the reduction in duration was only significant for the Cognitive group (1 = 3.64, 
p = .002). No changes in intensity and duration of pain were significant for the 
Control group. 
Table 4 shows results of MANOVAs for changes in intensity and duration of pain 
from Post-1 to Post-2. It will be seen from this Table that changes in both intensity 
and duration of pain were different depending upon type of intervention (I x T), 
indicating that the intervention strategies showed different capabilities in the main- 
tenance of treatment effects upon musculoskeletal pain. Relapses were most evident 
for intensity and duration of pain in the shoulders among subjects in the Cognitive 
group and in duration of low back pain among subjects in the Combined group 
(see Figure 2).However, relapse was significant only for the duration of low back 
pain in the Combined group (t = 2.54, p = .018).

DISCUSSION 
The efficacy of the interventions proved to be different for the upper and lower 
sections of the back. This applied to both intensity and duration of pain, although 
results for intensity showed the most significant and consistent patterns of change 
from Pre to Post-1. The Cognitive and Combined intervention procedures were the 
more effective in reducing neck pain, whereas Relaxation was relatively successful 
in reducing low back pain. For shoulder pain, however, all three interventions were 
effective in reducing intensity of pain, whereas only the Cognitive approach to inter- 
vention was significantly effective in reducing duration of shoulder pain. 
The lack of efficacy of Relaxation in the treatment of neck pain may be due to 
a difference in causal factors of neck and low back pain and, therefore, a lack of 
sensitivity of intervention to causal factors in neck pain. Of course, the skills in the 
Relaxation procedure involve cognitive activity. However, they seem to focus upon 
the efforts to reduce muscle tension (Turk and Flor, 1984). The Cognitive procedure 
in our study, in contrast, aimed at the improvement of coping with psychosocial 
job-demands by means of a wide range of cognitive strategies; (e.g. the ability to 
distinguish between demands of different priorities, effective interpersonal commu- 
nication and preventive appraisals of potentially threatening situations). Our 
findings are consistent with previous findings showing a closer relationship between 
psychosocial factors and neck and shoulder pain than with low back pain (Svebak, 
1991; Winkel and Westgaard, 1992). However, such area-specific relationships are 
not consistently reported in recent studies (Ursin et al., 1988). 
Our suggestions about causal relationships between psychosocial factors and 
INTERVENTIONS ON BACK PAIN 38 I 
musculoskeletal pain gain some support from the present findings. The efficacy of 
the Cognitive procedure in reducing neck, and possibly also shoulder pain, indicates 
a significant role for ability to cope with psychosocial job-demands in the develop- 
ment of such pain in female hospital staff. On the other hand, relaxation skills 
emerged as efficient in the reduction of low back pain in particular. It is therefore 
possible that psychosocial factors are less causally related to low back pain in this 
subject sample. 
Finally, tests on the four months maintenance of treatment effects from Post-1 
revealed that the most stable scores were for low back pain reduction in the group 
exposed to Relaxation. It will be seen from the mean scores in Figure 2 that relapses 
appeared in shoulder pain among subjects in the Cognitive intervention and in low 
back pain among subject in the Combined intervention. However, there is no basis 
in these results for any explanation why the distributions around the means made 
only the latter relapse magnitude come out as statistically significant.
