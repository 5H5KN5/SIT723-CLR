workplace-based intervention to improve
nurses ’eating and physical activity

Abstract
Background: There is a critical need for an intervention to improve nurses ’eating and physical activity behaviours.
As nurses spend a substantial proportion of their waking hours at work, concerted efforts to deliver such
interventions in the workplace is growing. This study formed part of a multiphase programme of research that
aimed to systematically develop an evidence-based and theory-informed workplace intervention to promote
changes in eating and physical activity among nurses.
Methods: The intervention was developed iteratively, in line with Medical Research Council complex intervention
guidelines. It involved four activities: (1) identifying the evidence base, (2) understanding the determinants of
nurses ’eating and physical activity behaviour change through theory-based qualitative interviews and survey, (3)
identifying intervention options using the Behaviour Change Wheel, and (4) specifying intervention content and
implementation options using a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques.
Results: Data from 13 randomised controlled trials indicated that workplace-based behaviour change interventions
targeted to this population are effective in changing behaviour. The evidence base was, however, limited in
quantity and quality. Nurses ’beliefs about important factors determining their eating and physical activity
behaviour were identified across 16 qualitative interviews and 245 survey responses, and key determinants included
environmental context and resources, behavioural regulation, emotion, beliefs about consequences, knowledge and
optimism. Based on these findings, 22 behaviour change techniques suitable for targeting the identified
determinants were identified and combined into a potential workplace intervention.
Conclusions: An evidence-based and theory-informed intervention tailored to the target population and setting
has been explicitly conceptualised using a systematic approach. The proposed intervention addresses previous
evidence gaps for the user population of nurses. Further to this, such an intervention, if implemented, has the
potential to impact nurses ’eating and physical activity behaviours and in turn, the health of nurses and the quality
of healthcare delivery.

Background
Nurses, comprising approximately half the health work-
force, are crucial to an effective healthcare system. Yet,
poor eating behaviours and physical inactivity among
nurses have been reported across a range of different
countries [ 1–4]. In the United Kingdom (UK) and the
USA, studies have reported that over half of nurses are
overweight or obese [ 2,5]. Suboptimal eating and phys-
ical activity patterns among nurses have many implica-
tions. For instance, obesity and concomitant health
problems such as musculoskeletal disorders may be an
important determinant of sickness absence among
nurses [ 6]. Absenteeism in nurses may create overload
among the healthcare staff that remain, reducing work-
force capacity with inherent risks to the delivery of qual-
ity care to patients [ 7].
Given global nursing shortages, the retention of a
high-quality nursing workforce is a key policy issue for
healthcare system sustainability [ 8]. Policy-makers have
therefore emphasised the importance of developing ef-
fective and cost-effective interventions to support nurses ’
eating and physical activity and subsequent health [ 9].
As a case in point, the international movement of the
Health Promoting Hospitals and Services network
stresses the urgent need to improve the health behaviour
of nurses [ 10]. Workplaces are particularly advantageous
settings for the delivery of behaviour change interven-
tions as they enable repeated access to a relatively fixed
population who can spend up to one third of their wak-
ing lives at work [ 11,12]. Improved eating and physical
activity could therefore be consistently enacted over
time, maximising chances of sustained improvement of
health outcomes. This is a particularly pertinent advan-
tage given the recognised difficulty in long-term main-
tenance of behaviour change [ 13].
To date, a limited number of interventions to improve
nurses ’eating and physical activity have been developed
[14–16]. Despite evidence of effectiveness, previous
intervention development work in this area has not been
reported in sufficient detail to allow analysis of specific
individual intervention components. Theoretical ap-
proaches have also rarely been reported. This is import-
ant as interventions based on theory have been
identified as most effective at changing health behavior
[17]. The lack of empirical evidence on the ‘active ingre-
dients ’of these interventions makes it difficult to draw
conclusions about what works within workplace inter-
ventions to change nurses ’eating and physical activity
behaviours. This reduces the replication potential of in-
terventions, which is a crucial part of cumulative science
[18,19].
The Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for
developing and evaluating complex interventions advises
that an iterative development process should beundertaken for maximum replication potential and im-
pact [ 20]. This iterative process should include identifi-
cation of the evidence base, development of a theoretical
understanding of target behaviors and a modelling of
processes and outcome. The present study investigated
the existing evidence base with a systematic review,
identified relevant theoretical determinants of the target
behaviours with interviews and a survey informed by the
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [ 21] and mod-
elled the processes of change/identified appropriate
methods of changing behaviour using the Behaviour
Change Wheel (BCW) [ 22] and Behaviour Change Tech-
nique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) [ 23]. As an over-
arching theoretical framework, the TDF consists of 14
domains from several theories of health behaviour
change that can influence eating and physical activity.
The BCW is another framework that integrates health
behavior change theory and consists of nine intervention
functions to describe how an intervention might change
behavior and seven policy categories that can be used to
support the implementation of the intervention func-
tions. The BCW is supported by BCTTv1 which is a tax-
onomy of 93 replicable behaviour change techniques
(BCTs). Undertaking the process of using the TDF,
BCW and BCTTv1 ensures that any developed interven-
tion is tailored to the needs of the target population.
These methods mirror those used for systematically
developing interventions across a variety of populations
and behaviours. For example, Murphy et al. used the
TDF and BCW to develop a capacity-building interven-
tion to promote pharmacists ’roles in mental health care
[24]. The added value of this approach is that it supports
the selection of appropriate BCTs from the BCTTv1
[23]. BCTs are the ‘active ingredients ’of interventions
designed to bring about change in behaviours such as
nurses ’eating and physical activity. Recent mapping ex-
ercises by Cane et al. [ 25] and Michie et al. [ 26] have
identified the most appropriate BCTs to use to change
each of the possible theoretical determinants of behav-
iour identified within the TDF domains.
The aim of the present paper is to describe the devel-
opment of a new tailored and cohesive workplace behav-
ior change intervention which targets nurses ’eating and
physical activity behaviours using the TDF, BCW and
BCTs. It has been developed to an appropriate stage for
evaluation in a feasibility study.
Methods
Design
The development process is illustrated in Fig. 1. Report-
ing of the developed intervention is consistent with the
recommendations of the Template for Intervention De-
scription and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [ 27].Power et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:53 Page 2 of 14
Intervention development involved four key steps with
the procedure for these steps outlined below.
Procedure
(1) Identifying the evidence base
Step one drew upon the evidence base through a system-
atic review of the literature. The aims of the systematic
review were to (1) investigate the effectiveness of
workplace-based dietary and/or physical activity inter-
ventions targeting healthcare professional groups such
as nurses, (2) identify and describe key components of
effective interventions, (3) identify theoretical models of
behaviour change involved in effective interventions and
(4) investigate whether intervention effectiveness in this
setting is improved by the extent to which interventions
are explicitly developed based on theory. The methods
of this systematic review are reported in full elsewhere
[15].
(2) Understanding the theoretical determinants of nurses ’
eating and physical activity behaviours
This step reflects a behavioral diagnosis, whereby rea-
sons for nurses ’unhealthy eating and physical activity
behaviours and what needs to change to improve nurses
eating and physical activity behaviors were identified.
Semi-structured qualitative interviews followed by a
quantitative survey were undertaken based on the TDF.
The TDF is an overarching framework that summarises
84 known determinants of behaviour into fourteen the-
oretical construct domains [ 21], allowing the systematic
investigation of the psychological determinants which
may need to be addressed in order to achieve behaviour
change [ 21]. The methods of the qualitative interview
component of this step are reported elsewhere [ 28]. A
separate 113-item survey based on the determinants
identified in these qualitative interviews was also con-
structed and completed by 245 nurses (226 females, 17
males; recruited from hospitals based in the UK) [ 29].
This enabled quantitative estimation of the relative im-
portance of different determinants.
The current paper focusses on step three in more de-
tail. Specifically, how the findings from the behavioural
diagnosis above were mapped onto the BCW framework[22] and BCTTv1 [ 30] to systematically develop a work-
place behaviour change intervention for nurses. The
current paper therefore builds on the empirical work
generated from steps one and two.
(3) Identifying intervention options
Having previously identified the theoretical determinants
of nurses ’eating and physical activity behaviour change
using the TDF in step two [ 28], with details outlined in
the Results section of the current article, the BCW [ 22,
23] was used to identify how these theoretical determi-
nants of nurses ’eating and physical activity behaviour
could be targeted. The BCW is a synthesis of 19 behav-
iour change frameworks [ 22] which helps to organise
and identify intervention types ( ‘intervention functions ’)
and policy strategies ( ‘policy categories ’) that are likely
to be effective in changing particular theoretical determi-
nants (TDF domains) of target behaviours such as eating
and physical activity [ 22,23]. In the present study, pub-
lished matrices [ 23] were used to identify the most ap-
propriate intervention and policy options for changing
the theoretical determinants of nurses ’eating and activ-
ity behaviour identified during the TDF-informed inter-
views and survey.
Once broadly appropriate intervention and policy cat-
egories had been identified, specific BCTs were selected
using published matrices and mapping documents devel-
oped by Cane et al. [ 25] and Michie et al. [ 23] which
allowed specific techniques associated with particular
theoretical determinants and intervention types to be
identified. The evidence for the potential effectiveness of
each selected BCT was evaluated by conducting a rapid
scoping review. The likely parameters of effectiveness for
each technique (i.e. the circumstances under which each
technique would be expected to work) were also estab-
lished by consulting recommendations of the Iterative
Protocol for Evidence Base Accumulation [ 31] and using
the intervention mapping taxonomy of BCTs [ 32].
(4) Feasibility screening of developed intervention
This process was guided by the APEASE criteria (Af-
fordability, Practicability, Effectiveness/cost-effectiveness,
Acceptability, Side effects/safety, Equity). In applying
Fig. 1 Systematic step-wise intervention development processPower et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:53 Page 3 of 14
these criteria, acceptability, practicability and affordabil-
ity were considered as they are more appropriate for the
early phases of intervention development. By contrast,
effectiveness, side effects/safety, equity would be more
applicable to the intervention evaluation phase following
a full-scale trial.
Results
The evidence base
The systematic review results identifying the evidence
base that laid the foundation for intervention develop-
ment are reported in detail elsewhere [ 15] and sum-
marised briefly in this section. Thirteen randomised
controlled trials were retrieved. Despite evidence of ef-
fectiveness of workplace-based interventions to change
nurses ’eating and activity behaviours, the available evi-
dence base was limited in quality and quantity. Several
important gaps were noted which caused uncertainty in
establishing what intervention content and characteris-
tics contributed most to intervention effectiveness. Add-
itionally, few interventions to change nurses ’eating and
physical activity were underpinned by a coherent theor-
etical framework or formative research.
Theoretical determinants of nurses ’eating and physical
activity behaviour
Details of the qualitative interview study are reported
elsewhere [ 28]. In summary, across the 16 qualitative in-
terviews and 245 survey responses, the three most im-
portant barriers to nurses ’eating and physical activity
behaviour change related to environmental context and
resource factors such as time and the food environment,
emotional factors such as mood and stress and behav-
ioural regulation factors such as lack of self-monitoring
and planning. The three most important enablers identi-
fied were knowledge of relevant guidelines and strategies
for changing eating and physical activity behaviour, opti-
mism about likely outcomes of behaviour change at-
tempts and beliefs about the likely positive
consequences of healthy eating and physical activity.
Intervention options
Nine intervention functions and seven policy categories
from the BCW were identified as having potential to
bring about eating and physical activity behaviour
change in nurses (Tables 1and2).
Based on BCTs previously judged by a consensus of
four experts in behaviour change to be appropriate for
changing each selected intervention function [ 23], 89
BCT ’s likely to be suitable to change the identified deter-
minants were initially considered for selection. Guided
by a previous expert rating study [ 25], 22 out of the pos-
sible 89 BCTs were selected as those most likely to be
effective in changing the factors identified in thequalitative interviews/ survey as likely determinants of
nurses ’eating and physical activity (Table 3). Addition-
ally, it was found that certain combinations of BCTs
may interact with each other to amplify or reduce effect-
iveness. For example, the evidence suggests that Self-
monitoring of behaviour and subsequent Feedback are a
typically effective combination of BCTs. However, the
BCT: Threat (future punishment) may include fear
arousal is likely to be counter effective when self-
efficacy is low. There were insufficient studies retrieved
that examined which specific BCTs or BCT combina-
tions were most effective for distinct target populations
and settings.
Further information about the selected BCTs is out-
lined in detail within Additional file 1.
Table 4contains a full description of the proposed (or
suggested) intervention components. It summarises the
theoretical determinants of nurses ’eating and activity
behaviours, the BCTs likely to be able to change these
determinants and how these techniques may be trans-
lated in practice. The intervention is multimodal, involv-
ing a combination of digital and printed modes of
delivery. A multimodal approach to intervention delivery
was adopted as it is more likely to enhance effectiveness
and appeal to a wider range of nurse preferences. The
completed TIDieR checklist also provides further details
about BCT operationalisation examples including the
number, duration, intensity and dose of the digital ses-
sions (Additional file 2). A brief summary of the pro-
posed intervention that arose from the systematic step-
wise process adopted in the current study is presented
below. This scenario represents the result of a creative
process using the TDF, BCW and BCTTv1.
Nurses would have access to an online programme
with a personal page consisting of five modules. Module
1 contains recommendations on avoidance/changing ex-
posure to cues for eating and physical activity behaviour
such as determining appropriate servings in advance
when eating (BCT: Avoidance/changing exposure to cues
for the behaviour ). It could also include nurses keeping a
record of unhealthy snacking/physical inactivity on their
personal page (BCT: Self-monitoring of behaviour ).Mod-
ule 2 prompts nurses to imagine and compare likely or
possible outcomes following eating healthily/participat-
ing in physical activity versus not performing these be-
haviours (BCT: Comparative imaging of future
outcomes ), invites nurses to undertake a fitness and
strength test (BCT: Biofeedback ) and identify situations
or events occurring prior to unhealthy snacking/physical
inactivity (BCT: Antecedents ). Nurses would be advised
to track their mood alongside their eating and physical
activity behaviours on personal page of online-based
programme so as to identify the emotional consequences
of healthy and unhealthy behaviours for themselvesPower et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:53 Page 4 of 14

(BCT: Information about emotional consequences ).
Lastly, module 2 would also incorporate information to
increase the personal salience of the consequences of
unhealthy eating and physical activity behaviours (BCT:
Salience of consequences ).
Module 3 contains an expert video discussing the use
of stress management techniques such as progressive
muscular relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing to help
nurses manage their stress (BCT: Reduce negative emo-
tions ). A registered dietitian/nutritionist/physiotherapist
would also provide feedback within a motivational inter-
viewing session on healthy eating/physical activity pro-
gress (BCT: Feedback on behaviour ; BCT: Vicarious
reinforcement ) and verbally persuaded to enhance self-
efficacy (BCT: Verbal persuasion to boost self-efficacy ).
The motivational interviewing session would also entail
nurses providing their level of agreement/disagreement
with the following two statements ( “If I did not eat
healthily and participate in physical activity I would later
feel regret ”) and ( “If I did not eat healthily and partici-
pate in physical activity, I would later wish I had ”) (BCT:
Anticipated regret ). Further, nurses would be advised to
record how they feel after eating healthily/participating
in physical activity on the personal page of Module 4(BCT: Self-assessment of affective consequences ) under-
take a fitness and strength test and record how they feel
after eating healthily/participating in physical activity
(BCT: information about emotional consequences ).
Module 5 contains forum and discussion pages for
peer to peer social support (BCT: Social support (emo-
tional) ). In addition, nurses would be invited to attend
online group motivational interviewing sessions to boost
self-efficacy (BCT: Verbal persuasion to boost self-
efficacy ). Prior to each session, nurses would be re-
quested to self-monitor eating and physical activity be-
haviours (BCT: Self-monitoring of behaviour ). Similarly,
at a separate online group session, nurses would be re-
quested to describe and compare the advantages and
disadvantages of eating healthy/physical activity partici-
pation (BCT: Pros and cons ).
Coupled with digital intervention delivery, the work-
place physical environment would also be restructured
by the following evidence-based strategies; placing vinyl
footsteps on hospital floors to promote stair walking
(BCT: Restructuring the physical environment ), smaller
portion sizes would be provided in the hospital canteen
and food would be calorie labelled at the point of pur-
chase (BCT: Prompts/cues ). Nurses could also be advisedTable 2 Intervention function and policy category matrix

about entry to a draw for a non-monetary incentive for

about the increased risk of chronic disease following un-
healthy dietary/physical activity patterns could be placed

social norm messages via a social marketing campaign
would be implemented (BCT: Restructuring the social

fear appeal message in combination with a self-
affirmation message would also be implemented (BCT:
Threat (future punishment )). A logo would be profes-
sionally created and utilised across all intervention com-
ponents to promote the intervention. A web-based staff
newsletter and social media used for communicating in-
formation about social and environmental consequences
of healthy eating and physical activity would also be im-
plemented (BCT: Information about social and environ-
mental consequences ).
Feasibility screening of developed intervention
Table 5displays the details of the APEASE evaluation
carried out on the candidate intervention components.Discussion
The current study describes the systematic, evidence-
based and theory-informed approach to developing a tai-
lored workplace intervention that aims to change nurses ’
eating and physical activity behaviours. The intervention
has been rigorously developed to reflect current best
practice in intervention development [ 20,23,27]. It is
anticipated that by adopting a systematic, evidence-
based and theory-informed approach for intervention
development, the capacity to effectively change nurses ’
eating and physical activity behaviours will be improved.
To change nurses ’eating and physical activity outcomes,
the intervention is specified by nine intervention func-
tions and seven policy categories and consists of 22
evidence-based and theoretically underpinned BCTs.
It is unclear at this stage whether the depicted scenario
is superior to other potential options. A digital mode of
delivery of BCTs targeting individual level determinants
of eating and physical activity behaviours is expected to
enhance the potential for equitable intervention delivery.
Nurses ’values and preferences should also be used to
guide decisions around what workplace intervention
mode of delivery to take forward. Adopting a person-
centred approach and basing the intervention develop-
ment on nurses ’views is anticipated to enhance the like-
lihood that the intervention will be accepted andTable 4 Theoretical Domains Framework target determinants, behaviour change techniques (BCT) and BCT operationalisation within

ultimately effective [ 33]. Evidence generated from our
formative work indicates that approximately three in
every four nurses would be willing in principle to par-
ticipate in a randomised controlled trial of a workplace
eating and physical activity intervention. Improving par-
ticipation among nurses is particularly important given
reports that of all healthcare professional groups work-
ing in hospitals, nurses have the lowest participation in
workplace health promotion activities, despite displaying
the highest rates of obesity and overweight [ 3].
Several aspects of the developed intervention are in-
novative. For example, few studies have proposed to
change nurses ’beliefs about consequences. The inter-
vention will enable nurses to adopt comparative imagin-
ing of future outcomes (in the form of online group-based motivational interviewing sessions), an effective
technique for changing eating and physical activity be-
haviours [ 34,35]. Additionally, the intervention will use
social support to change emotional responses. It is
widely recognised that for initiating and sustaining
health behaviour change, positive types of social support
from friends, family and colleagues is particularly im-
portant [ 36]. Online (in the form of an online support
community tailored to the preferences and characteris-
tics of nurses specifically) and face-to-face sources of so-
cial support both appear to help people maintain long-
term health behaviour changes [ 37].
To ensure implementation success, consideration
should also be given to the affordability, practicability,
effectiveness/cost-effectiveness, acceptability, side-Table 5 Feasibility screening of developed intervention (guided by a subset of APEASE criteria) (Continued)

effects/safety and equality (APEASE) of the intervention.
By using this APEASE criteria (Table 5)[23], additional
insights can be made to inform a tailored intervention
package and implementation strategy. For instance, imple-
menting many of the environmental changes will require
large numbers of stakeholders at multiple levels of influ-
ence to also change their behaviour. Reluctance or inabil-
ity of stakeholders to introduce environmental changes
may limit the feasibility, acceptability and practicality of
implementing environmental changes. Assessing the ex-
tent to which stakeholders such as hospital chief execu-
tives and department managers would be supportive of
potential changes to the hospital environment is an im-
portant step in the development of an effective interven-
tion implementation strategy [ 12]. As they are likely to be
the agents who will decide on implementation options, an
assessment of their views may provide an avenue for en-
hancing their ‘buy-in ’and advocacy.
Strengths and limitations
The present study applied a theoretical and evidence-
based approach to behaviour change. Determinants of
two target behaviours (i.e. eating and physical activity)
were identified and mapped to appropriate intervention
functions, policy categories and BCTs to develop a speci-
fied workplace behaviour change intervention tailored
for nurses. In line with dual-process or dual-systems the-
ories of behaviour [ 38], it is important to highlight that
the determinants identified within this study represent
the perceptions of nurses and as such reflect only those
that operate with some degree of conscious awareness.
There may be additional determinants shaping nurses ’
eating and physical activity behaviour, beyond their
awareness that have not been captured (e.g. unconscious
biases towards eating behaviours or activities). The se-
lection of intervention functions and policy categories
was undertaken in the intervention development process
to facilitate a precisely specified and parsimonious inter-
vention. In retrospect, this step in the development
process was less directive than expected. It was found
that any proposed intervention might incorporate all the
available intervention functions and policy categories.
This was the first application of the BCW and TDF to-
gether to the development of a workplace eating and
physical activity behaviour change intervention. Hence,
deciding on the most appropriate intervention functions
and policy categories in the context of limited prior
guidance available may be one reason for the lack of
brevity.
An alternative and perhaps more useful approach
would have been to proceed directly from the behav-
ioural diagnosis using the TDF (steps 1 and 2) to select-
ing BCTs for the intervention. Notwithstanding this, by
reporting the intervention development steps completelyand transparently, hypothesised mechanisms of behav-
iour change in any resulting intervention could be tested
in a definitive clinical trial [ 39]. Such sharing of best
practice in intervention development can contribute to a
cumulative understanding of eating and physical activity
behaviour change in nurses, thereby increasing the value
of this research and the proposed interventions replica-
tion potential [ 27]. The methods used for operationalis-
ing BCTs were subjective. It is therefore possible that
another research team would yield different ideas for
how best to operationalise the BCTs. Standardised and
transparent methods to report BCT operationalisation
will need to be established to ensure this phase of the
intervention development process can be replicated.
Implications for research
Given the increased scrutiny being placed on the ease
with which published results can be reproduced or repli-
cated [ 40], the intervention development methods pre-
sented in this study represent an important contribution
to knowledge. They have the potential to avoid research
redundancy. An exploration of nurses ’preferences for
the best modes of delivery for these BCTs (e.g. face-to-
face such as one-on-one or group, print or web) and
intervention intensity (e.g. contact frequency, number of
contacts, contact time) is warranted to further optimise
the intervention development process.
Implications for practice
The workplace intervention developed in this study is
now ready for formal evaluation in a trial and might
have the potential in future to markedly impact upon
employee absenteeism, presenteeism, productivity and
retention outcomes [ 41,42] and overall quality of care
[14]. Highlighting the possible financial returns for em-
ployers on investment in health interventions may serve
to increase uptake of the developed workplace interven-
tion among healthcare organisations. The intervention
meets expert recommendations on promoting employee
health in the UK National Health Service system [ 36]. It
therefore represents a practical application through
which healthcare organisations can improve nurses ’eat-
ing and physical activity practices.
Conclusions
The current study presents a detailed example of how a
workplace behaviour change intervention can be devel-
oped by integrating empirical evidence, with the TDF
and BCTs. In this sense, it will enable research evidence
to accumulate on the content used, which should inform
any potential replication efforts in the future. The cohe-
sive workplace intervention developed provides a proto-
type which could be taken forward for full feasibility
testing and formal evaluation.Power et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:53 Page 12 of 14
