Abstract
Background: Cancer affects millions of individuals globally, with a mortality rate of over eight million people
annually. Although palliative care is often provided outside of specialist services, many people require, at some
point in their illness journey, support from specialist palliative care services, for example, those provided in hospice
settings. This transition can be a time of uncertainty and fear, and there is a need for effective interventions to
meet the psychological and supportive care needs of people with cancer that cannot be cured. Whilst Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been shown to be effective across diverse health problems, robust evidence
for its effectiveness in palliative cancer populations is not extensive.
Method: This mixed-methods study uses a single-case experimental design with embedded qualitative interviews to
pilot test a novel intervention for this patient group. Between 14 and 20 patients will be recruited from two hospices in
England and Scotland. Participants will receive five face-to-face manualised sessions with a psychological therapist.
Sessions are structured around teaching core ACT skills (openness, awareness and engagement) as a way to deal
effectively with challenges of transition into specialist palliative care services. Outcome measures include cancer-specific
quality of life (primary outcome) and distress (secondary outcome), which are assessed alongside measures of
psychological flexibility. Daily diary outcome assessments will be taken for key measures, alongside more detailed
weekly self-report, through baseline, intervention and 1-month follow-up phases. After follow-up, participants will be
invited to take part in a qualitative interview to understand their experience of taking part and acceptability and
perceived effectiveness of the intervention and its components.

Discussion: This study is the first investigation of using ACT with terminally ill patients at the beginning of their
transition into palliative treatment. Using in-depth single-case approaches, we will refine and manualise intervention
content by the close of the study for use in follow-up research trials. Our long-term goal is then to test the intervention
as delivered by non-psychologist specialist palliative care practitioners thus broadening the potential relevance of the
approach.

Background
Globally, over 14 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed
each year, and 8.4 million deaths were attributed to cancer
in 2012 alone [ 1]. Finding out that cancer is no longer cur-
able can be psychologically di stressing for both patients and
their family [ 2]. Indeed, recognition of distress as the sixth
‘vital’sign to monitor in cancer care is receiving increased
attention [ 3,4]. The subsequent transition following a refer-
ral into specialist palliative care services when cancer is no
longer curable can be a time of uncertainty and fear. When
living with uncertainty, it can become difficult to satisfactor-
ily plan for the future [ 5] which is crucial at this stage of
cancer [ 6]. Quality of life may also be negatively affected [ 7].
There is, therefore, a clear need for effective interventions to
meet the psychological and supportive care needs of cancer
patients at this point in their illness [ 8] which the current
evidence base does not provide [ 9].
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT [ 10]) is a
form of cognitive behavioural therapy that has a good
evidence base for the type of psychological problems
often reported by people affected by cancer, for example,
anxiety and depression [ 11], but specific evidence for its
effectiveness in palliative cancer populations is lacking/
limited [ 12]. Within the ACT model, distress is under-
stood as being a normal reaction to a difficult situation,
and ACT supports people to become more resilient [ 13]
and self-compassionate [ 14] when in distress. ACT is
underpinned by a number of therapeutic processes, in-
cluding mindfulness, acceptance and cognitive defusion
[15], which then support the individual to be more en-
gaged with values-based living [ 12]. Within a palliative
care setting, this framework is suggested as a helpful ap-
proach in supporting people to identify what is import-
ant to them and to help them live a life of meaning,
quality and value, even when faced with challenging cir-
cumstances. Overall, ACT encourages people to be psy-
chologically flexible [ 16], which is thought may help
with distress management in people with incurable can-
cer [17].
A number of cross-sectional studies have demon-
strated associations between ACT therapeutic processes,
distress and quality of life outcomes in cancer patients
[18,19]. Other work has shown that psychologicalflexibility correlates also with positive adjustment indica-
tors, such as benefit finding [ 20]. Intervention studies
have reported feasibility and acceptability of ACT self-
help interventions [ 21], and there is early evidence for
the effectiveness of interventions in both curative and
advanced cancer samples [ 22].
Whilst there are sound theoretical reasons why ACT
should be useful in palliative care settings [ 12], we are
aware of just one study which is feasibility testing the
use of ACT for patients who are more established within
the palliative care pathway [ 17]. Research is therefore
needed to establish its broader empirical support [ 9]. In
addition, although there have been recent studies explor-
ing mechanisms and moderators of ACT interventions
(e.g. increases in psychological flexibility and reduction
in experiential avoidance) [ 23–25], these mechanisms,
and how they relate to specific therapeutic components,
are not well understood. Importantly, these processes
have not yet been thoroughly explored in the context of
a terminal cancer diagnosis, a setting which brings
unique personal and environmental challenges.
This work aims to develop, and pilot test, a brief, man-
ualised psychological intervention to provide support to
people with an incurable cancer diagnosis who are at the
transition into specialist palliative care services. We aim
to further explore the feasibility of delivering this inter-
vention within a hospice and community environment.
Our planned study allows us to tentatively test the ef-
fectiveness of the intervention in a small sample of par-
ticipants using a single-case, controlled design. We will
explore mechanisms and processes of improvement in
patient wellbeing through intervention delivery and
short-term follow-up to further refine the intervention
for subsequent research and clinical use. We are also
monitoring data on acceptability, recruitment, attrition
and eligibility in order to determine best practices mov-
ing forward into larger trials.
Methods/design
This study uses a mixed-methods approach to both de-
sign and pilot test a novel psychological intervention for
this patient group. A mixed-methods approach is appro-
priate for this research question as quantitative data canHulbert-Williams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:104 Page 2 of 9
be supplemented by ideographic narrative data that re-
cords the unique perspective of patients in the trial [ 26].
Mixed-methods also allow researchers to evaluate the
saliency and acceptability of defined constructs and
components during a pilot test [ 27], ensuring suitability
prior to larger, more expensive trials. We will incorpor-
ate patient feedback through the full development
process (at design, intervention development and evalu-
ation) to ensure that the intervention is acceptable to
the patient group for whom it is designed [ 28].
The intervention will be delivered individually, using a
single-case experimental design [ 29], to community-
based patients accessing specialist hospice day and com-
munity services at two Marie Curie clinical services in
England and Scotland. Single-case experimental designs
are appropriate for this kind of study because they allow
for highly controlled intervention delivery [ 30] and a pa-
tient-centred, in-depth analytic strategy. We use them
here to facilitate process modelling and accurate inter-
vention development [ 31] in line with MRC guidance for
the development of complex interventions [ 32]. They are
idiographic in nature and also allow for the detailed
examination of effects through quantification of out-
come and process variables [ 33].
The primary aim of a single-case experimental design
is to indicate that any observed change in outcome re-
sults from the application of the intervention. Single-
case designs are commonly used in psychological inter-
vention research [ 34] and have proven utility in cancer
research [ 35]. As an intervention study, this is a phase I
‘modelling ’study [ 32] that will lead on to a later feasibil-
ity trial of the developed, manualised, intervention. As
such, delivery of the current study will be under optimal
conditions (i.e. by trained psychologists/psychothera-
pists) to ensure high levels of fidelity and content qual-
ity, in addition to creating a therapeutically and ethically
safe environment for participants and intervention facili-
tators. Establishing proof of principle in this way is a
vital first step in fully developing and evaluation a com-
plex intervention [ 32].
Intervention: rationale and development
Previous research, including pilot work conducted by
our team [ 18–20,23], demonstrates that ACT is a psy-
chological intervention that is both relevant and accept-
able to people with cancer. Intervention content for this
specific study was initially developed through a thorough
review of literature describing common challenges and
psychological problems faced by cancer patients at the
stage of advanced cancer/palliative care. The literature
describes common themes around: loss of control [ 36];
fear, understanding and acceptance [ 37]; rapid loss of in-
dependence, shifting relationship dynamics and theimportance of balancing life tasks against limited time
available [ 38].
Alongside this conceptual review, we used general
ACT intervention guidance [e.g. 39, 40], resources avail-
able on the Association for Contextual Behavioural Sci-
ence website ( www.contextualscience.org ), and ACT
intervention development expertise within the study re-
search team to plan treatment strategies and methods
likely to be effective in promoting psychological flexibil-
ity: effective living, in the presence of the kinds of psy-
chological responses described in the literature above.
The intervention was developed by two ACT experts
(DG and NHW) and then iteratively refined in consult-
ation with the broader research group and our study pa-
tient and stakeholder reference group (including two
cancer patients, a family carer and a healthcare profes-
sional working in a hospice setting).
The intervention manual consists of five sessions (see
Table 1). Each is designed for one-to-one, face-to-face
delivery, and to last approximately 45 to 60 min per ses-
sion. At this early stage of intervention development
work, we have designed the intervention to be delivered
by an experienced therapist with either a doctoral level
clinical psychology qualification or a Masters level CBT
qualification (or equivalent) conferring active British As-
sociation of Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy accredit-
ation. Intervention facilitators are not required to have
prior experience of working in a palliative care setting;
during induction, they will undertake the standard hos-
pice induction which includes observation and orienta-
tion in the hospice. Previous training and experience in
delivering ACT-based intervention is desirable, though
not essential for this study.
In addition to local hospice induction, training will be
provided by the intervention authors (NHW and DG)
through the use of self-study materials, simulated video
role-play, and practice role-play opportunities. The level
of training provided will be tailored dependent on the
prior experience and skills of the individuals appointed
to this role. Before delivery of the intervention to study
participants, therapists will undertake a competency as-
sessment where their delivery of the intervention (with a
simulated patient) will be video-recorded and assessed
against a previously validated ACT rating scale [ 39].
Therapists are required to score at least 90 (correspond-
ing to ‘average competence ’) before delivering the inter-
vention in the clinical setting. Where this level of
competency is not achieved, further training will be pro-
vided. There will be one therapist at each clinical site to
ensure continuity for participants recruited and
consistency of delivery between participants for added
methodological quality. Clinical supervision will be pro-
vided by an existing member of the team who is suitably
qualified for this role (JSt).Hulbert-Williams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:104 Page 3 of 9
Module A takes the majority of the first intervention
session. Session two then covers module B plus one of
the ACT-specific modules (C, D or E) in an order deter-
mined by the therapist to best meet the needs and prior-
ities identified and negotiated with the participant in
session one. Sessions 3 and 4 cover the remaining mod-
ule content (C, D or E), with module F delivered at 1-
month follow-up. The level of flexibility inherent in the
design will allow for greater understanding of delivery
differences between participants and a more refined un-
derstanding of which elements produce what kinds of
changes in outcome and process variables.
Each week, participants are provided with homework
exercises to build skills. These include sheets to help
prompt mindfulness activities, defusion exercises, values
creation and committed actions based on identified
values. Homework exercises also include short audio re-
cordings to prompt mindfulness, values contact, and
defusion skills. Summary sheets of the key themes of
each session are provided to participants at the end of
each session to be used as aide-memoire; a modified ver-
sion of this is also provided to be given to any family
members or carers who have questions about the inter-
vention content. The family/carer summary sheets are
for information only rather than intending to be used
for personal benefit.
Participants: eligibility criteria and referral into the study
People over 16 years of age who have been told that they
have an incurable cancer diagnosis and who are referred
to specialist hospice day or community services at two
hospice sites (one in England and one in Scotland) will
be identified by hospice-based community nursing teams
and invited to participate (see Table 2). Eligible partici-
pants must have a life expectancy of 4 months or more
and, although limited to those affected by cancer, arenot restricted to any particular cancer type. Seven to ten
participants will be recruited from each recruitment site
with the aim of completing the intervention with four-
teen participants in total.
Information and consent processes
Community nurses who undertake an initial assessment
on referral into the hospice services will provide an over-
view of the study and provide a study pack which in-
cludes a patient information sheet, information for
family members and a study consent form. Participants
will be given time to consider the study invitation and
then, if interested, will be asked to provide consent to be
contacted by the research team. At this point, the re-
searcher will contact participants by telephone and (i)
explain the study in greater detail, covering intervention
aims and assessment; (ii) give participants an opportun-
ity to ask questions; (iii) explain practicalities such as
session frequency, location and transport; and (iv) ar-
range a first appointment. Written informed consent will
be taken as part of the first session with the therapist.
Procedure
Ethical approval has been obtained from an NHS Re-
search Ethics Committee (IRAS Project ID: 239683), in
addition to relevant approvals from the research govern-
ance committees at Marie Curie Hospice Liverpool and
Marie Curie Hospice Edinburgh. These two hospices
have been selected pragmatically due to proximity to the
collaborating University research sites; however, they af-
ford a comparison between delivery across (a) two UK
countries and (b) settings both with (Edinburgh) and
without (Liverpool) a dedicated in-house hospice re-
search lead.
Intervention sessions will take place at the hospice and
last between 45 and 60 min. During the assessmentTable 1 Intervention components
Module Purpose Elements
A Assessment and engagement Warmth, empathy, positive regard. History taking, typical responses to transition, beginning baseline
monitoring and introducing measurement protocol and concepts.
B Workability Review of typical responses and greater contact with the consequences, linking ineffective strategies
with control, avoidance and cognitive fusion.
C Awareness Teaching awareness skills, linking to greater behavioural choice, mindfulness exercises, 5 senses
experience, mindful eating a raisin, 10-min mindfulness audio exercise given for homework.
D Openness Demonstrating the greater effectiveness of willingness to have difficult thoughts and feelings and at
the same time, stepping back from such inner experiences. Using leaves on the stream exercise,
singing negative thoughts, speaking negative thoughts in a funny voice, perspective taking around
thoughts, kick your buts exercise, ‘I’m having the thought that …’exercise.
E Engagement Linking behavioural effectiveness with desired outcomes and qualities of actions, in order to live with
purpose and meaning in the end stage of life. Concept of values, and actions, sweetspot exercise, the
compass metaphor, generating hierarchies of difficult actions.
F Review and ending (1 month follow
up)Review of progress after 4 weeks of no treatment, barriers to practice, anticipation of future
challenges and how open, aware and engagement skills could be used, behavioural rehearsal of
effective responses, commitments to next steps. Ending contact.Hulbert-Williams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:104 Page 4 of 9
interview, participants will complete baseline measures
described below. These measures are repeated at the
start of each subsequent intervention session. Daily
process and QoL data will be gathered using either the
smart-phone based app (Personal Analytics Companion
(PACO) [ 40]) or a paper and pencil booklet equivalent.
Completion of daily diaries will be monitored by the re-
search team, and where three consecutive recordings are
missed, the researcher will contact the participant by
telephone to discuss barriers to completion. In the case
of non-app-based diary data collection, we will not be
able to undertake such regular checking (this can hap-
pen only at face-to-face meetings with the therapist for
these participants), and thus, smartphone data collection
methods will be strongly encouraged.
During the final intervention session, the therapist will
explain the purpose of the follow-up qualitative inter-
view, providing both written information and an oppor-
tunity to answer any questions that participants might
have about this. Consent will be collected at that time by
the therapist. Two weeks later, participants will be con-
tacted by the researcher. Interviews will be conducted
on a one-to-one basis either in the hospice (face-to-face)
or via telephone. Interviews will be recorded for later
transcription and analysis. The interview schedule is de-
signed to help participants to express their experiences
of taking part, acceptability of intervention content and
perceived effectiveness of the intervention and its com-
ponents. In addition, the interview will also ask about
caregivers ’experiences during the intervention.On completion of the study, participants will be pro-
vided with a study debrief sheet, including information
about getting additional support. Procedures for dealing
with any distress due to the interview have been care-
fully considered and pathways into further support out-
lined and agreed with the relevant clinical care teams.
Once the study has been completed in each clinical
site, we will invite all staff members involved with the
study (recruitment, site-specific study management etc.)
to focus groups where we will undertake discussions and
data collection on any challenges and barriers that they
experienced during the study. We will also seek their
opinions about acceptability, effectiveness and impact on
the patient and their family and suggestions for how the
study design should be improved for later trials.
Data collection
Weekly self-report questionnaires will be administered
throughout the intervention to assess changes in quality
of life (our primary outcome), distress (secondary out-
come) and ACT intervention processes (as potential me-
diating variables).
Daily diaries will be used to attempt more sensitive
and specific measurement of process change. Daily re-
cordings are known to produce more valid and accurate
results than retrospective summary reports [ 41]. Partici-
pants will have the choice to access these daily record-
ings either via a smartphone app or paper versions to
ensure ease of access. The use of a smartphone app
(PACO [ 40]) for daily data collection is relatively novelTable 2 Protocol for recruitment and intervention delivery

within palliative care trials, and so, this pilot data will
allow us to conclude whether this is a feasible alternative
to paper-based data collection methods for similar work.
Data will also be collected on the number of patients
approached about the study, the number then recruited,
attrition, and reasons for non-eligibility in order to in-
form later feasibility and effectiveness trials.
Primary outcome
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
Therapy—palliative care (weekly) [ 42]
T h eF A C I T - p a lm e a s u r e st h ef u n c t i o n a lq u a l i t yo fl i f ei n
palliative care. The scale is comprised of five domains: phys-
ical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items),
emotional well-being (6 items ), functional well-being (7
items) and additional concerns (19 items). Each item is
measured on a Likert scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).
Cronbach ’s alpha has previously been reported at .90 for the
full 27-item scale and .78 to .87 for sub-scales, suggesting
strong internal consistency [ 43].
Secondary outcomes
Distress thermometer (weekly) [ 44]
The DT is a single-item measure of distress on a scale
from 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress). It has been
validated as a worldwide measure of distress in people
affected by cancer [ 45].
Comprehensive assessment of Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy processes (weekly) [ 46]
The CompACT is a measure of the postulated mechanism
of action and process of ACT. It consists of 23 items
grouped into three sub-scales (openness to experience, be-
havioural awareness and valued action) which map closely
onto our three core intervention sessions (modules C, D
and E). Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging
from 0 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Psycho-
metric properties of the CompACT have been shown to
be adequate [ 46].
Brief Acceptance Measure (daily) [ 47]
The BAM is a three-item measure of psychological flexi-
bility, specifically designed for use in single-case experi-
mental designs and similar daily diary studies. Participants
rate the previous 24 h on each of three dimensions of
openness, awareness and engagement in valued activities
on a 1 to 10 numeric scale. Scales are anchored at either
end with indicative statements (e.g. 1 = struggling with
thoughts, feelings and physical sensations versus 10 =
open to thoughts, feelings and physical sensations). The
BAM total score has an alpha of .71 and correlates
strongly with the CompACT ( r=.57,p< .001). The BAM
is also sensitive to brief interventions designed to increase
psychological flexibility in healthy adults.Single-item QoL (daily)
A single quality of life item will be used to measure
overall health. This is an item in which participants rate
their health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health
state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).
Feasibility outcomes
Although this study is not designed as a phase II feasibil-
ity study, relevant data will be collected on the number
of patients screened for eligibility, number patients po-
tentially eligible, number of patients recruited, and per-
centages of consented participants who complete the
intervention and follow-up. Percentage drop-out, deaths
during the study, and missing data (i.e. how much of the
self-report questionnaires were completed by partici-
pants) will be monitored and recorded throughout the
study. This information, together with the pilot accept-
ability data, will be used to inform the next phase of our
research —a full feasibility study —by clarifying whether
this is a potentially appropriate setting and timepoint in
the patient pathway to deliver a psychological interven-
tion. Undertaking full feasibility testing at this stage is
inappropriate given that we do not yet have fully devel-
oped, acceptable, intervention content.
Sample size
Potentially high rates of attrition need to be considered
in any palliative care research when determining the
sample size [ 51]. We aim to recruit 14 patients who
complete the full intervention. Given a high probability
of attrition, we expect to recruit approximately 20 pa-
tients allowing for such attrition. This sample size is
more than sufficient for a single-case research design
[48,49] which purposely recruits only small samples
given their idiographic focus. All participants who
complete the intervention will be invited to participate
in the qualitative interview.
Data analysis
Quantitative data
Analysis of daily diary data (BAM and QoL single-item)
will include visual analysis, calculation of stability enve-
lope, between-phase mean level change and the percent-
age non-overlapping data, as is standard to single-case
methodology [ 48]. Advances in statistical analysis of sin-
gle-case experimental design data now allow researchers
to calculate pvalues and effect sizes from single-case data,
and to aggregate these across single cases, using metanaly-
tic methods [ 49]; such analyses will be undertaken where
data permit their use. These data will provide tentative
and preliminary indications of effectiveness and will be re-
ported with 95% confidence intervals where relevant.
Weekly questionnaire data will be analysed with visual
analysis and level change [ 50].Hulbert-Williams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:104 Page 6 of 9
Management of missing data
We assume that some participants will be unable to
complete the weekly and daily self-report questionnaires
at certain times during the study period. Given that the
weekly questionnaires will be filled out immediately be-
fore each session and administered by the therapist, we
anticipate no participants missing any weekly question-
naires. However, it is likely that participants will miss
opportunities to record the daily measures. Members of
the hospice team will be made aware if a participant
misses three or more daily recordings in a row in order
to determine if the reason is due to health deterioration
prior to the research team following up with the partici-
pant directly to discuss any technical issues in recording
this data.
Qualitative data
Follow-up interviews with participants will be audio-re-
corded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a
framework analysis approach [ 52]. Framework analysis is
particularly well suited for applied health research that
aims to answer specific questions within a limited time
frame [ 53]. It allows for the analysis of data thematically
whilst undertaking an exploratory analysis of the dataset.
Staff focus groups will be analysed using this same ana-
lytic approach.
Manual revision
Alongside data collection from participants, and the
focus groups with hospice staff, we will also seek ex-
pert peer-review of the manual. The intervention
manual will be circulated to experts within our own
professional networks, including (a) ACT experts, (b)
clinical psychologists who do not identify primarily as
ACT-oriented, (c) cancer/palliative care nurses and
(d) palliative care specialists. We will aim to seek
feedback from at least five expert reviewers who are
independent from our project team.
Peer-review feedback will be triangulated with the
quantitative and qualitative data from the empirical part
of this study to inform a revised version of the interven-
tion manual. The revised manual will be worked on ini-
tially by the original two authors (DG and NHW) and
then presented to the broader research group and the
study patient and stakeholder reference group for com-
ments before finalising at the end of the study.
Discussion
There is a growing appreciation for the need for hol-
istic support for people with cancer that cannot be
cured who are transitioning into specialist palliative
care settings; this needs to include evidence-based
psychological care [ 22]. Our work aims to build on a
small existing literature by pilot testing a novel, briefand manualised ACT-based intervention to improve
psychological support for this population. Our work
will determine whether or not the intervention is
feasible and acceptable in this setting and will provide
a foundation for subsequent research to test interven-
tion efficacy in potentially more scalable formats, such
as delivery by nurses and allied health professionals,
in either group or individual settings.
The use of a mixed-method, single-case design will
provide both quantitative and narrative data that will in-
dicate potential efficacy and mechanism of the interven-
tion and also allow an in-depth analysis of patient
experience. This is a rare design choice in psychosocial
oncology and palliative care research, and we intend for
our study to provide an example of how this approach
can be well-suited to phase I intervention development
and modelling work [ 32].
If this development phase proves successful, the next
phase in our programme of work will be to feasibility
test the manualised intervention using potentially more
cost-effective means of delivery and more conventional,
group-based randomised controlled designs. To allow
this, we will use data collected in this development study
to revise the content of the intervention manual. This
pilot work will generate acceptability data, and informa-
tion on practical challenges and potential barriers to up-
take and retention, to ensure maximised likelihood of
success in these follow-on trials.
Key to the success of this study will be our embedded
approach of involving people affected by cancer [ 54]. In
addition to a patient representative as a grant co-appli-
cant and member of the Project Management Group
(SM), we have recruited a patient and stakeholder refer-
ence group who will input on intervention content, pilot
trial design, analysis of data and refinement of the inter-
vention manual on study completion. This will be based
on more extensive feedback from patient participants in
the study who take part in the embedded qualitative
interviews.
Dissemination plan
A primary output from this study will be a published,
open-access, delivery manual for the intervention. Al-
though this will not have been robustly efficacy tested, we
expect the data from this study may be sufficient to allow
health care professionals to choose whether or not they
wish to use this immediately. Findings from this study will
be published in peer-review journal articles and at a range
of conferences, including palliative care, psychosocial on-
cology and psychological intervention audiences for maxi-
mised impact. A lay summary will be available for
participants and their families and to be circulated to key
stakeholder organisations.Hulbert-Williams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:104 Page 7 of 9
Conclusions
This paper reports a study protocol and so we are lim-
ited in the conclusions that we can make at this stage.
However, the forthcoming results will have high import-
ance for both theory and palliative care literatures. Re-
garding theoretical implications, this study will expand
our knowledge of how the ACT framework can be
adapted and applied to people with cancer that cannot
be cured, as they transition into palliative care services:
this is a previously unexplored application of the ACT
intervention framework. There is a high need for data-
driven research into how we can best support the psy-
chological and supportive care needs of people transi-
tioning into care: our study is the first step in developing
a novel intervention to fill this crucial research and ser-
vice-delivery gap.
