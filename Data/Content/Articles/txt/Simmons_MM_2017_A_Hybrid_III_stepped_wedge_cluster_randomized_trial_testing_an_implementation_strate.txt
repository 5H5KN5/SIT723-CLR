Abstract
Background: Homeless veterans often have multiple health care and psychosocial needs, including assistance
with access to housing and health care, as well as support for ongoing treatment engagement. The Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) developed specialized Homeless Patient Alignment Care Teams (HPACT) with the goal of
offering an integrated, “one-stop program ”to address housing and health care needs of homeless veterans.
However, while 70% of HPACT ’s veteran enrollees have co-occurring ment al health and substance use disorders,
HPACT does not have a uniform, embedded treatment protocol for this subpopulation. One wraparound
intervention designed to address the needs of homeless v eterans with co-occurring mental health and substance
use disorders which is suitable to be integrated into HPACT clinic sites is the evidence-based practice called
Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach , and Networking-Veterans Edition,
or MISSION-Vet. Despite the promise of MISSION-Vet with in HPACT clinics, implementation of an evidence-based
intervention within a busy program like HPACT can be diff icult. The current study is b eing undertaken to identify
an appropriate implementation strategy for MISSION-Vet within HPACT. The study will test the implementation
platform called Facilitation and compared to implementation as usual (IU). The aims of this study are as follows:
(1) Compare the extent to which IU or Facilitation strategies achieve fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention as
delivered by HPACT homeless provider staff. (2) Compa re the effects of Facilitation and IU strategies on the
National HPACT Performance Measures. (3) Compare the effects of IU and Facilitation on the permanent housing
status. (4) Identify and describe key stakeholders ’(patients, providers, staff) experiences with, and perspectives on,
the barriers to, and facilitators of implementing MISSION.
Design: Type III Hybrid modified stepped wedge implementation comparing IU to Facilitation across seven HPACT
teams in three sites in the greater Los Angeles VA system. This is a cluster randomized trial.

Discussion: Integrating MISSION-Vet within HPACT has the poten tial to improve the health of thousands of veterans,
but it is crucial to implement the intervention appropriately in order for it to succeed. The lessons learned in this protocol
could assist with a larger roll-out of MISSION within HPACT. This protocol is registered with clinicaltrials.gov and was
assigned the number NCT 02942979.

Background
Veterans comprise 10% of the homeless population in the
USA and often have multiple complex health care and
psychosocial needs that threaten housing stability [1, 2]. To
address these needs, the Dep artment of Veterans Affairs
(VA) developed specialized Homeless Patient Aligned Care
T e a m s( H P A C T ) .T h eg o a lo fH P A C Ti st oo f f e ra ni n t e -
grated “one-stop program ”that takes into account social
determinants of health to ad dress medical and mental
health, substance use disor der (SUD), and psychosocial
needs (e.g., housing, benefits) of homeless veterans [3]. This
is consistent with the patient-centered medical home model
that is commonly delivered within and outside of the VA
system [4, 5] but different in that HPACT is specifically
tailored to address complex needs of homeless veterans.
While HPACT have a strong track record of improving
care for homeless veterans [1], the main focus is
engagement in primary care and enhancing access to spe-
cialty care for this vulnerable population. However, though
most (70%) of HPACT ’s enrollees have co-occurring mental
health and substance use disorders, it does not have a
uniform, embedded treatment protocol for these patients
and often addresses these disorders through referrals to
specialty care. Co-occurring mental health and substance
use disorders are a risk factor for homelessness and can
result in higher rates of treatment disengagement, poor
community integration and higher utilization of costly
emergency department, and inpatient mental health and
medical services [1].
One wraparound intervention designed to address the
needs of homeless veterans with a co-occurring mental
health and substance use disorders which is suitable for
integration into HPACT clinic sites is the evidence-
based practice called Maintaining Independence and
Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach, and
Networking-Veterans Edition, or MISSION-Vet. Studies
to date suggest that MISSION-Vet, when utilized with
homeless individuals, improves treatment engagement
for individuals with co-occurring mental health and
substance use disorders and with mental health and
substance abuse outcomes and reduces the number of
days homeless and re-hospitalizations [6, 7]. Based on
literature supporting the efficacy of MISSION-Vet, it has
recently been added to the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Registry of Evidence-BasedPractices [8 –11]. Implementation of MISSION-Vet
within HPACT would fill the current gap by integrat-
ing treatment of co-occurring mental health and
substance use disorders within HPACT clinics as opposed
to addressing the needs through referrals which can frag-
ment care and increase engagement issues.
Despite the promise of MISSION-Vet within HPACT
clinics, implementation of an evidence-based interven-
tion within a busy program like HPACT can be difficult
[12–15]. It is known that in settings like HPACT clinics,
site training and offering treatment manuals through the
web alone, while less burdensome and resource inten-
sive, are insufficient [12 –15]. Therefore, the current
study aims to identify an appropriate implementation
strategy for MISSION-Vet within HPACT in the Greater
Los Angeles (GLA) VA system to address the needs of
homeless veterans with co-occurring mental health and
substance use disorders. The project will be comparing
implementation as usual (IU) to Facilitation at the
facility level. Facilitation offers a process by which site
level staff are assisted and supported in implementing and
sustaining a new program or practice [16]. This paper de-
scribes the implementation protocol for this study.
Methods
Overview
The hypothesis of this project is that Facilitation will
yield better adoption and fidelity to MISSION-Vet
among HPACT clinics compared to IU. To test this
hypothesis, we will utilize a type III Hybrid modified
stepped wedge implementation design [17], meaning this
is a cluster study design. Type III stepped wedge designs
are increasingly being used in health services research
because they offer a way to assess both the implementa-
tion strategy in the facility level and health outcomes
[18, 19]. This project will implement MISSION-Vet
within GLA ’s HPACT teams across three facilities (West
LA VA Medical Center, Sepulveda, and Downtown). In
keeping with our study design, instead of starting all
intervention and control sites together, the design will
stagger introduction of Facilitation.
HPACT
The HPACT model is based around four key elements:
(1) open access, meaning care on-demand which is notSimmons et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:46 Page 2 of 10
reliant on mail/telephone-based scheduling and limited
appointments; (2) homeless-tailored care; (3) intensive
case management/high-frequency care meaning an
ambulatory-intensive care unit (ICU) approach with
high-frequency care; and (4) staff trained to work with
homeless veterans with attention to engagement of this
population [20]. Consistent with other medical home
models, within HPACT, all of the medical services re-
quired by the veteran are typically co-located [20].
There are 60 HPACT clinics nationally. Currently,
HPACT serve almost 18,500 veterans, 84.86% of whom
receive mental health care, which includes substance
abuse services. HPACT has proven successful: internal VA
data show that among those enrolled in HPACT, there is a
25% reduction in emergency department (ED) visits, 25%
reduction in hospitalizations, and more consistent care
where patients average four primary care visits per year.
In GLA VA specifically, local VA data examining
medical complexity scores of their HPACT clients
suggests that those served are often sicker than the aver-
age HPACT patient nationally. For this reason, engage-
ment can be problematic, particularly for homeless
veterans with co-occurring mental health and substance
use disorders. For example, in the last 7 months, the
4018 GLA HPACT veterans averaged 0.28 visits per
person per month for those referred to substance use
care compared to the program ’s national average of 0.51.
In the last 4 months, inpatient hospitalizations for GLA
have increased 30% after HPACT enrollment. In
contrast, HPACT has nationally reduced inpatient
admissions by 7%. Given the complexity of GLA HPACT
patients, a comprehensive intervention like MISSION-Vet
could help the GLA HPACT clients get both access to and
engaged in treatment services for co-occurring mental
health and substance use disorders.
MISSION-Vet clinical intervention
In MISSION-Vet, services are provided by a team com-
prised of a case manager and a peer team. Each veteran
should, with optimal fidelity, receive 2.5 h of team
support weekly. A core component of MISSION-Vet is
ritical Time Intervention which includes both assertive
outreach and structured psychoeducation sessions [21],
a time-limited assertive case management model.
Critical Time Intervention is intended to reduce the risk
of homelessness through additional support to individuals
with mental illness during the transition from institutions
(e.g., inpatient psychiatry units, residential treatment
programs, and homeless shelters) to community living or
to engage individuals already living in the community in
care. These Critical Time Intervention services are
delivered in three phases of decreasing intensity: Transi-
tion to Community, Try-Out, and Transfer of Care. Dur-
ing the Transition to Community phase, services areintended to reinforce community living and linkages to
key community support services to build a safety net
within the community. During the Try-Out phase, the
case manager/peer specialist team begins to readjust the
community-based support systems to fill any gaps and
reduce service intensity to help the veteran test what it is
like to live in the community. Finally, visits during the
Transfer of Care phase are used to fine-tune connections
with community-based resources.
Additionally, MISSION-Vet supplements Critical Time
Intervention with 13 dual recovery therapy (DRT)
psychoeducational sessions which are delivered by the
case manager [22 –24]. These sessions, which are highly
structured, include the use of motivational interviewing
[25] and relapse prevention [26] techniques. They specif-
ically target issues commonly facing homeless veterans
with co-occurring mental health and substance use
disorders. MISSION-Vet also includes 11 structured
psychoeducational sessions with peer specialists that are
designed to empower veterans to plan for a life of stability,
sobriety, and community integration. In addition to
Critical Time Intervention, DRT, and Peer Support,
MISSION-Vet case managers/peer specialists also offer
assistance with employment and are trained to deliver
trauma-informed services, which have been found to be
effective with our target population [27, 28]. While each
component of MISSION-Vet has demonstrated efficacy
on its own, when combined using the MISSION-Vet
platform, they work together to increase treatment
engagement, improve mental health and substance abuse
outcomes, and reduce ER visits, re-hospitalizations, and
recurring homelessness [6, 7, 29].
Delivery of MISSION-Vet is guided by a Treatment
Manual [30], which serves as a how-to-guide that
describes MISSION-Vet ’s core components and sugges-
tions for service delivery and includes a number of
appendices with additional didactic materials. Peer spe-
cialists also give veterans the MISSION-Vet Consumer
Workbook [31] at the onset of treatment. This is
intended to promote treatment engagement. This work-
book is designed to serve as a complement to the Treat-
ment Manual and help veterans integrate DRT and peer
support concepts and increase their engagement in
outpatient services through homework assignments,
readings, and checklists.
In addition to the MISSION-Vet Treatment Manual
and Consumer Workbook, MISSION-Vet also in-
cludes a structured webinar training. These trainings
last 2 h and provide an overview of MISSION-Vet ’s
treatment model. They also offer an introduction to
developed materials (manuals and fidelity measure).
The training also covers the role of the supervisor,
whose job is to provide ongoing consultation ensuring
fidelity to MISSION-Vet.Simmons et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:46 Page 3 of 10
Passive implementation: implementation as usual
Passive implementation or IU for MISSION-Vet is com-
prised of the aforementioned 2 h webinar training, along
with key information on how to access and use the
MISSION-Vet Treatment Manual and Consumer Work-
book. The manual is posted on the web and available
inside the VA on the National Center for Homelessness
among Veterans website or at missionmode.org. This
passive strategy has been used in previous studies [32].
Implementation platform: Facilitation
Facilitation is a comprehensive approach in which imple-
mentation experts partner with local staff to support
implementation planning and to tailor adoption strat-
egies to local contexts [33, 34]. Facilitation is rooted in
the belief that while evidence to support a practice is
important, it is equally important to draw on local
clinical experience and professional knowledge to tailor
implementation to local priorities, preferences, and
resources [35]. Thus, Facilitation gives attention to ad-
dressing individual- and organizational-level factors that
can influence successful implementation of an evidence-
based practice with good fidelity [16, 20, 35].
To accomplish this, implementation experts serving as
facilitators work to establish supportive relationships
with those at the participating clinical setting to focus
on implementation planning, goal-setting, and problem-
solving [36]. In this study, Facilitation includes external
and internal facilitators working in tandem to support
MISSION-Vet implementation.
External facilitators (EF) are external to the implementa-
tion site and have general expertise in implementation
strategies and quality improvement processes. Internal
facilitators (IF) are located at the implementation site,
meaning they are familiar with facility-level organizational
structures, procedures, culture, and clinical policy and
processes within the system at regional or local facilitylevel. The EF and IF work collaboratively to present sites
with design considerations and steps to implement
evidence-based practices and offer ongoing data monitor-
ing to identify gaps and solutions for implementation. The
EF works during the course of the project to transfer
knowledge and understanding of effective implementation
strategies and processes to the IF, thus fostering introduc-
tion and retention of skills into the local organization so
they can be leveraged not only for the current effort, but
also for future quality improvement activities.
As depicted in Fig. 1, for this project, Facilitation will be
initiated in month 7 of year 1 and run for 12 months at
each site. In operationalizing Facilitation, a research team
member (JLS) with extensive experience and expertise in
applying external facilitation strategies to support
adoption of evidence-based practices will serve as EF
[2, 19, 37, 38]. A clinical team member from the GLA
VA will serve as IF. During the first 6 months of the pro-
ject, the IF will receive general training on Facilitation and
on the role of the IF. This training will be conducted in
GLA by the EF. Once trained, the IF, mentored and
supported by the EF, will partner directly with GLA VA
HPACT programs to guide implementation of MISSION-
Vet as prescribed in the IF model —more specifically, by
helping HPACT staff to develop local plans, goals, and
objectives for MISSION-Vet implementation; to secure
needed resources for successful implementation; and to
ensure all aspects of MISSION-Vet are well planned,
including addressing organizational barriers and tailoring
to local conditions, monitoring implementation progress
and fidelity, problem-solving to address barriers, and
working to ensure MISSION-Vet sustainability.
Participation sites and recruitment
Site composition
This study includes seven HPACT teams across three
sites at the GLA VA. We selected GLA VA because of
Fig. 1 Project timelineSimmons et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:46 Page 4 of 10
the size and scope of the homeless population: LA
County has the second highest homeless population
nationally, and GLA serves more homeless veterans than
any VA in the nation. Within each HPACT team, there
are two groups of subjects: one is case managers and
peers and the other is HPACT veterans. Each team is
comprised of staff at an HPACT clinic. The teams are
composed of the following: teams A –D (West LA VA
Medical Center; 44 HPACT team members and staff and
3100 veterans in total), team E (Sepulveda; 7 HPACT
team members and staff and 407 veterans), and team F
(Downtown; 8 HPACT team members and staff and 528
veterans), for a total of 59 HPACT team members and
staff and 4018 veterans.
Recruitment
All staff will be recruited into training at the three GLA
sites. Consent will be obtained prior to training. Training
will also include information about how the HPACT staff
(in IU and Facilitation groups) can identify eligible
veterans who meet the MISSION-Vet program criteria
and begin to engage them in MISSION-Vet services.
Engaging veterans into MISSION-Vet will take place on
a rolling basis as the intervention is activated at each
site. While this study targets case managers for recruit-
ment, we will encourage case managers to follow the
same recommended inclusion and exclusion criteria that
are appropriate for their client ’s participation in
MISSION-Vet: (1) meet the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition [39], diagnostic
criteria of International Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision [40], for a current substance abuse or depend-
ence disorder (e.g., alcohol, marijuana, cocaine) or
polysubstance use and a co-occurring mental illness that
includes anxiety, mood, or a psychotic spectrum
disorder, (2) is willing to participate in the service, and
(3) is empaneled in HPACT at one of the study sites.
Study design
This study will use a stepped wedge design, which is a
form of a cluster randomized study in which the inter-
vention is sequentially implemented in all clusters of
over a number of set time periods. Order of the start
time of the intervention in each cluster is determined by
random assignment. In a stepped wedge design, there is
an initial time period in which no clusters receive the
intervention, and all clusters cross over into the inter-
vention condition by the end of the study. In the present
study, the aforementioned HPACT clinics will form the
naturally occurring clusters and Facilitation will be
implemented in each clinic, with the start order for each
clinic being randomly assigned by a random number
generator. This allows us to evaluate the impact of the
intervention but does not deprive any site eventuallyreceiving the intervention [41]. This design will also
allow us to identify and control for secular trends better
than parallel groups randomized controlled trials [41].
The intervention will be implemented in two of four
teams in the first site (site A) in the first step of the
wedge. One will receive IU and the other Facilitation.
After the initial phase of Facilitation, implementation
will be applied in the other two GLA medical center
teams and the other sites (site B and C) in a stepwise
fashion as described below. Figure 1 includes a specific
timeline for the study design.
This design will allow all sites to receive 1 year of
Facilitation, and all sites but the first two teams (the
pilot sites) to have a 1 year IU observation period and
serve as its own control.
Measures, procedures, and analyses by study aim
Aim 1: Compare the extent to which Facilitation and
implementation as usual (IU) strategies achieve fidelity to
the MISSION-Vet interven tion as delivered by HPACT
homeless provider staff
Data sources MISSION-Vet Fidelity Measure; Evidence-
Based Practice Attitudes scale; Organizational Support
for Evidence-Based Practices scale [42 –45]
Measures and data collection The Clinical Note Tem-
plate embedded within the VA ’s computerized patient
record system will be used at all sites to document the
degree to which Facilitation enhances fidelity over and
above IU. The MISSION-Vet Fidelity Measure tracks all
the core elements of the MISSION-Vet treatment model,
including Critical Time Intervention, DRT, Peer Support,
vocational supports, and trauma-informed care for each
individual veteran. The fidelity index consists of 78 items
assessing the presence or absence of certain activities
within MISSION-Vet and will be captured in veterans ’
electronic medical records. Taking the responses from
all non-missing items, we will compute a fidelity score
for each veteran. Data on all HPACT veterans at all sites
will be obtained from electronic medical records
available in the VA ’s Corporate Data Warehouse. The
Evidence-Based Practice Attitudes scale and the
Organizational Support for Evidence-Based Practices
scale [42 –45] will provide information on potential
mediating factors. We will administer this measure to all
HPACT staff annually throughout the study period.
Hypothesis Fidelity will be superior in Facilitation
compared to IU.
Data analysis A mixed-effect linear regression model
will be used to compare Facilitation and IU conditions on
the fidelity tool ’s total score after 1 year of Facilitation,Simmons et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:46 Page 5 of 10
with a random intercept included in the model to
account for clustering of veterans within HPACT
team members. Assuming an effect is observed for
Facilitation vs. IU, we will further explore potential
moderators to this effect with two-way interaction
terms between Facilitation and potential moderating
factors.
Aim 2: Compare the effects of Facilitation and IU strategies
on the National HPACT Performance Measures
Data sources We will rely on data from the Corporate
Data Warehouse that captures inpatient and outpatient
services utilization to assess the effect of Facilitation
(relative to IU) on (1) inpatient hospitalizations and (2)
engagement in substance abuse services.
Measures and data collection We will use Corporate
Data Warehouse data to construct measures of
inpatient hospitalizations and engagement in substance
abuse services. We will measure the number of medical,
mental health, and overall inpatient hospitalization
days in each month of the study ’s observation period.
Engagement in substance abuse services will be mea-
sured by the number of outpatient visits in a VA sub-
stance abuse specialty clin ic, which will be identified
based on clinic stop codes, in each month of the
study ’s observation period.
Hypothesis Veterans will show greater improvement as
indicated by reduced inpatient hospitalization days and
increased engagement in substance abuse services (i.e., a
greater number of visits in substance abuse specialty
clinics) when receiving Facilitation compared to when
receiving IU.
Data analysis We will assess the effect of Facilitation
using the modeling approach for stepped wedge
designs outlined by Hussey and colleagues [41]. Spe-
cifically, this will entail modeling the outcomes
described above using a three-level mixed-effect
regression model in which the covariate of interest is
a fixed effect for Facilitation (vs. IU), and that in-
cludes fixed effects for each time period to control
for temporal trend, as well as random effects to
account for clustering within veterans over time,
HPACT case managers, and HPACT teams. As these
outcomes are not likely to be normally distributed,
we will explore several models (e.g., linear mixed
models in which the outcome measure is log trans-
formed, Poisson or negative binomial mixed models)
to determine the best approach for modeling these
outcomes.Aim 3: Compare the effects of IU and Facilitation on
permanent housing status
Data sources Data on permanent housing placement
and utilization of VA specialized homeless programs
obtained from the VA National Homeless Registry.
Measures and data collection We will create separate
measures of (1) the number of days spent in VA special-
ized homeless programs (e.g., Grant and Per Diem,
Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans, Supportive
Services for Veteran Families rapid re-housing) for
which veterans meet the statutory definition of home-
lessness; (2) number of days in VA permanent housing
programs for which veteran is considered housed; and
(3) number of days residing in the community (i.e.,
veteran is in neither VA homeless or VA permanent
housing programs) during each month of the study
period.
Hypothesis Veterans will spend more days in VA
permanent housing programs and in the community,
and fewer days in VA specialized homeless programs
when receiving Facilitation compared to IU.
Data analysis W ew i l lu s ea na n a l y t i ca p p r o a c ht h a t
parallels that described in Aim 2. Specifically, we will
assess the impact of IU by using mixed-effects regres-
sion models in which the covariate of interest is a
fixed effect for Facilitation (vs. IU), and that includes
fixed effects for each time period to control for
temporal trend, as well as random effects to account
for clustering within veterans over time, HPACT case
managers, and HPACT teams.
Aim 4: Identify and describe key stakeholders ’(patients,
providers, staff) experiences with, and perspectives on, the
barriers to and facilitators of implementing MISSION
Data sources Semi-structured interviews will be
conducted for a formative (FE) and summative evalu-
ation (SE). The FE interviews will elicit key stakeholders ’
experiences with, and perspectives on MISSION-Vet
training, barriers to and facilitators of implementing
MISSION-Vet as well as to identify particular areas to
target for Facilitation. Summative evaluation interviews
will identify stakeholder ’s experiences with Facilitation
and needed adaptations to MISSION-Vet as well as
veteran experiences with MISSION-Vet.
Measures and data collection All semi-structured in-
terviews will be conducted by phone. For the FE, 13 –18
individual, semi-structured qualitative interviews will be
conducted with HPACT staff trained in MISSION-Vet.Simmons et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:46 Page 6 of 10
For the SE, participants will include 12 patients (two per
site) and 15 –20 providers/staff. Interview questions will
focus on evaluating the implementation of Facilitation,
IU, and MISSION-Vet with particular focus on barriers
to Facilitation, perceptions of strengths and weaknesses
of MISSION-Vet for this population and setting, and
leadership support for implementation in HPACT.
The goal of the qualitative portion of this project is to
get an understanding of what staff thought about
MISSION-Vet itself and for researchers to understand
the organizational context and then to identify barriers
and facilitators to implementation of MISSION-Vet so
that these areas can be addressed through Facilitation
once it is activated.
Data analysis Each interview will be recorded and tran-
scribed verbatim. A codebook will be developed with a
priori codes based on Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research [46] along with emergent the-
matic coding [47]. For the FE, interviews will be coded
and analyzed to synthesize data on organizational
strengths and weaknesses and to identify key areas for
the Facilitation strategy to target. The same process will
be followed with the SE. The SE will enable us to
identify the differences and similarities experienced by
participants both within LA sites and across the sites.
These similarities and differences within and across sites
will serve as a key “lessons learned ”for subsequent
efforts to facilitate use of MISSION-Vet across a larger
number of sites in the VA.
Power analysis
We conducted power calculations for Aims 1, 2, and
3 with the aid of the pwr package [48] in the Renvir-
onment for statistical computing version 3.2.4 [49]
and found that the anticipated sample sizes for all
t h r e ea i m sh a v es u f f i c i e n ts t a t i s t i c a lp o w e rb yc o n v e n -
tional guidelines (i.e., 80% power to detect interven-
tion effects at the 0.05 significance level). Aim 4 is a
qualitative aim and we therefore did not conduct
power calculations for that aim. Specific details on
the power calculations for each of the quantitative
aims are provided below and are based on an
expected sample size of 1808 veterans and 53 HPACT
staff members. This sample size estimate was based
on the known rates of mental health and SUD disor-
ders among HPACT participants, which suggest that
conservatively, half of the 4018 veteran HPACT
participants (or 2009 veterans) will meet the eligibility
criteria for MISSION-Vet and participate in the study.
The estimates also account for an anticipated 10%
refusal among the 59 GLA HPACT staff members,
which is assumed to result in an additional 10%
decrease in the number of veteran participants.Aim 1 involves an analysis of a cross-sectional out-
come, and we thus calculated statistical power by cor-
recting for the clustering of veterans within HPACT staff
members, but not for the stepped wedge design. To do
so, we calculated a “design effect ”(Deff), which is
commonly used in cluster randomized studies to esti-
mate the effective sample size and resulting statistical
power after accounting for clustering. We calculated the
design effect using the formula Deff = 1 + (n−1) ×ρ,
where nis the number of subjects within a cluster (in
this case number of veterans per HPACT staff member)
and ρis the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [50].
The value of nis 1808/53 = 34.1, and because the
ICC is unknown, we assumed a moderately large
value of 0.10. In turn, the design effect was calculated
as 1 (34.1 −1) × 0.1 = 4.3, resulting in an effective
sample size of 1808/4.3 = 420. With unclustered data
and assuming an available sample of 420 veterans to
be randomized to a treatment and control group, a
two-sample ttest with 80% power and significance
s e ta tt h e0 . 0 5l e v e lw o u l db es u f f i c i e n tt od e t e c ta
minimum effect size (ES) of 0.19. An ES of 0.19 is
conventionally considered to be a small effect.
For Aims 2 and 3, we calculated and applied a sep-
arate design effect that has been developed specifically
for stepped wedge designs, and that adjusts both for
clustering and for the design itself [50]. In this case,
the design effect was calculated using the formula
Deff =1þρðktnþbn−1
1þρ1
2ktnþbn−1 ðÞ⋅31−ρðÞ
2tk −1
kðÞ,w h e r e ρis the ICC, kis
the number of steps in the stepped wedge design, n
is the NC of veterans per HPACT team member, bis
the number of baseline measurement time periods,
and tis the number of measurements after each step.
The ICC is assumed again to be 0.10, with n
estimated to be 1808/53 = 34.1 and k,b,a n d tset
equal to 3, 12, and 4 in accordance with the study
design. This results in a design effect of 0.17, and an
effective sample size of 1808/0.17 = 10,635. Without
adjusting for clustering and repeated measures, a
sample of this size would be sufficient to detect an
ES of 0.04, assuming 80% power and setting signifi-

Aims 2 and 3.
Design challenges
The major design challenge in this study is contamin-
ation. However, we specifically selected GLA VA because
it is a large medical center with numerous sites that
generally operate separately. We believe the risk of
contamination between sites, even co-located sites, is
minimal because they are high service demand clinics
(for example, over 100 walk-in patients per day) andSimmons et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:46 Page 7 of 10
complex evidence-based interventions have been diffi-
cult to implement without Facilitation in these settings.
A second design challenge is how to best get
MISSION-Vet into practice within the busy HPACT
programs within GLA VA. Because the HPACT pro-
viders are under pressure to serve at least 12 veterans
daily, it will be important to determine if MISSION-Vet
services will need to be delivered by HPACT staff or
whether providers from other programs will be co-located
within HPACT to deliver MISSION services. In many
ways, without Facilitation, it will make the implementation
as usual more of a challenge.
Finally, blinding in the traditional sense, e.g., data
collectors blind to subjects ’treatment assignment, will
not be possible; however, all outcome data will, in large
part, be coming from secondary sources.
Discussion
A major goal for the VA is to end veteran homelessness by
2016 (Blueprint for Excellence). One method of doing this
is by improving access to and engagement in treatments
for homeless veterans with co-occurring mental health
and substance use disorders [51, 52]. By leveraging the
intervention point of HPACT, the MISSION-Vet interven-
tion has the potential to help accomplish this goal.
Integrating MISSION into HPACT will promote access to
appropriate treatments, housing stability, and recovery in
this complex population with both medical and addiction
care needs. However, in order for MISSION-Vet to be
successful within HPACT, it is crucial that we utilize the
appropriate implementation strategy.
In this case, Facilitation will be employed and has
the promise to help get MISSION-Vet into practice.
Because Facilitation has been used extensively as an
implementation strategy in VA [19, 53], we know that
it has worked well in similar settings. However, our
study design will allow us to thoroughly evaluate how
useful it is in the case of HPACT and MISSION-Vet.
A strength of this study is the flexibility that a basic
stepped wedge design offers; it is not uncommon to
modify aspects of the implementation within a
stepped wedge design as you turn on sites and learn
from them, particularly in the context of health services
studies where the study environment is highly dynamic
[54–56]. Another advantage to using this modified
stepped wedge design is that all sites over time receive the
Facilitation strategy, which can be important for policy or
ethical reasons [57, 58].
While the homeless veterans with co-occurring mental
health problems and SUD are difficult to reach, this
intervention has the potential to assist a complex
population of homeless veterans in accessing and en-
gaging in services in GLA for co-occurring mental health
and substance use disorders. Reaching this populationwith MISSION has could promote housing stability and
reduce the use of high-cost health care services like detox
ER visits and acute hospitalizations due to relapse. The
lessons learned in this study will be vital to nationwide
implementation of MISSION-Vet within HPACT, further
expanding the positive impact of this intervention.
