intervention in the most rural and remote
districts of Zambia: a process evaluation of
safe motherhood action groups

Abstract
Background: A community-based intervention known as Safe Motherhood Action Groups (SMAGs) was
implemented to increase coverage of maternal and neonatal health (MNH) services among the poorest and most
remote populations in Zambia. While the outcome evaluation demonstrated statistically significant improvement in
the MNH indicators, targets for key indicators were not achieved, and reasons for this shortfall were not known. This
study was aimed at understanding why the targeted key indicators for MNH services were not achieved.
Methods: A process evaluation, in accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework, was conducted
in two selected rural districts of Zambia using qualitative approaches. Focus group discussions were conducted
with SMAGs, volunteer community health workers, and mothers and in-depth interviews with healthcare providers.
Content analysis was done.
Results: We found that SMAGs implemented much of the intervention as was intended, particularly in the area of
women ’s education and referral to health facilities for skilled MNH services. The SMAGs went beyond their
prescribed roles to assist women with household chores and personal problems and used their own resources to
enhance the success of the intervention. Deficiencies in the intervention were reported and included poor ongoing
support, inadequate supplies and lack of effective transportation such as bicycles needed for the SMAGs to facilitate
their work. Factors external to the intervention, such as inadequacy of health services and skilled healthcare
providers in facilities where SMAGs referred mothers and poor geographical access, may have led SMAGs to
engage in the unintended role of conducting deliveries, thus compromising the outcome of the intervention.
Conclusion: We found evidence suggesting that although SMAGs continue to play pivotal roles in contribution
towards accelerated coverage of MNH services among hard-to-reach populations, they are unable to meet some of
the critical sets of MNH service-targeted indicators. The complexities of the implementation mechanisms coupled
with the presence of setting specific socio-cultural and geographical contextual factors could partially explain this
failure. This suggests a need for innovating existing implementation strategies so as to help SMAGs and any other
community health system champions to effectively respond to MNH needs of most-at-risk women and promote
universal health coverage targeting hard-to-reach groups.

Background
Zambia is one of the countries in the Sub-Saharan region
with poor maternal outcomes [ 1,2]. Despite reductions in
maternal and neonatal morta lity rates in Zambia, approxi-
mately 398 deaths per 100,000 live births and 24 per 1000
live births were reported in the recent Zambia Demographic
Health Survey (ZDHS) [ 1]. Arguably, most of these deaths
could be averted if all women utilised the maternal and
neonatal health (MNH) services [ 3]. Unfortunately, in many
developing countries similar to Zambia, poor women living
in the most remote and rural areas are least likely to receive
adequate MNH care, including antenatal care (ANC), skilled
birth attendance (SBA) and postnatal Care (PNC), due to
service utilisation challenges such as geographical and
socio-cultural barriers [ 4–8]. In the most remote and rural
areas of Zambia, only a third of women receive SBA and
PNC [ 4]. There is a need to improve the utilisation of and
access to MNH care services for women, particularly those
in rural areas. Increasingly, community-based interventions
through community health workers (CHWs) have been
receiving recognition as an effective strategy to improve
utilisation and access related to health facility-based services
[9–11]. By serving as a linkage be tween the community and
the formal health system, CHWs are well-placed to bridge
the service delivery gap in poor-resource settings [ 10], often
through effective refe rral to health services [ 12,13]. Zambia
has also been responding to the challenges of poor access
and utilisation of MNH services through community-based
interventions, and among them are the Safe Motherhood
Action Groups (SMAGs).
Description of the community-based intervention
In 2013, through the Health for the Poorest Population
(HPP) programme, a community-based intervention was
designed to strengthen MNH services. Through this pro-
ject, intensified efforts were made to reduce disparities
in MNH services through SMAGs. The goal was to
make pregnancy safer through accelerated delivery of
priority MNH interventions (ANC, SBA and PNC). The
SMAGs, although not scaled up in all the districts, have
been in existence in Zambia since 2003. The aim of the
SMAGs programme was to raise awareness about preg-
nancy and birth-related complications and to reduce
critical delays in decision-making at a household level
about seeking life-saving maternal healthcare in health
facilities [ 14]. The programme was also aimed at im-
proving access to MNH services through linkages be-
tween the community and the healthcare facility [ 14].
Specifically, in the HPP project, the aim of the SMAG
intervention was to reduce disparities in intervention
coverage for MNH services and help meet the national
targets (80 and 60% for ANC at least four times and
SBA, respectively) for coverage among the remote and
poorest populations in rural areas.The SMAGs are groups of women and men working
as CHWs, traditional birth attendants (TBAs), child
health promoters or growth monitoring promoters, mal-
aria agents and lay counsellors. The SMAGs were re-
cruited and trained in safe motherhood skills. The
choice and recruitment of SMAGs were guided by the
Zambia Ministry of Health standards that entail one
CHW for every 500 of the population. A standard train-
ing programme of 5 days was used to empower SMAGs
with safe motherhood knowledge and skills, specifically
for promoting antenatal care, delivery in a health facility
with a skilled provider, postnatal home visits and essen-
tial neonatal care. SMAGs were specifically trained in fo-
cused antenatal care to identify danger signs, encourage
women to start ANC early, attend ANC at least four
times and receive skilled deliveries. In addition, SMAGs
were trained in essential newborn care, including the
provision of effective cord care, early initiation of exclu-
sive breastfeeding and reporting maternal and neonatal
deaths that in the community.
The key roles SMAGs played in the intervention were
to refer women for ANC, delivery and complications
during pregnancy, delivery and the postnatal period; ac-
tively following up women to close the gap in the MNH
continuum of care; and providing facility-based birth
preparedness messages to pregnant women and their
spouses in the community. The work by the SMAGs
was voluntary, and they could be called upon anytime a
woman in the community needed their services. The
Neighbourhood Health Committees and health facility
staff, including district coordinators, supervised the im-
plementation of the SMAG activities.
Outcomes of the community-based intervention
An outcome evaluation was conducted based on house-
hold survey data collected at three time points during the
implementation of the intervention: baseline, mid-point
(mid-line) and end-point (end-line).
Observations from the outcome evaluation showed a
statistically significant effect of the deployment of the
SMAG intervention on most of the MNH outcomes of
interest, ANC, SBA and PNC, with an increasing trend
over time. Although statistically significant, the increase
in coverage over time was programmatically marginal,
and the programme ’s targets for coverage were not met
(42 versus 80% for focused ANC, and 49 versus 60% for
SBA) except for PNC for within 48 h by SMAGs (22 ver-
sus 20%). This study was therefore aimed at understand-
ing why the targeted key indicators for MNH services
were not achieved.
There were also variations at the district level in cer-
tain outcome indicators of interest, such as postnatal
care, the details of which were reported by Jacobs et al.
[15] on the outcome evaluation of the intervention.Jacobs et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:74 Page 2 of 10
Similar to the findings in other community-based
intervention studies [ 16–18], the observed results of
the outcome evaluation needed further explanation,
taking into account interac tions between contextual
factors and the SMAG intervention. Therefore, the
purpose of this paper was to understand why the tar-
geted key indicators for MNH services were not
achieved. Specifically, the paper explored the follow-
ing questions: (1) Was the intervention (the SMAGs)
implemented as it was intended? (2) What are the
factors external to the intervention that may have in-
fluenced implementation of the intervention? and (3)
What are the possible mechanisms that likely explain
the gap between achieved and targeted outcomes?
This study will provide an understanding of possible
explanations for the partial success of the SMAG
intervention, taking into account the contextual fac-
tors under implementations occurred, so as to inform
similar future programmatic decision-making.
Methods
Study setting
The study was conducted in two remote districts, lo-
cated in Luapula and the northern provinces of Zambia.
The districts are among the four districts for the HPP
where the SMAGs programme was implemented [ 15].
To select the study districts, we first stratified the dis-
tricts into two provinces. Within each of the two prov-
inces, we randomly selected one of the two intervention
districts by flipping a coin. From each of the selected
districts, two intervention health facilities were randomly
selected using a lottery method, where all the facilities
were assigned numbers, after which two numbers were
selected at random.
Design
A process evaluation was conducted retrospectively, in
accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC)
framework [ 19,20], between November 2016 and Janu-
ary 2017, using focus group discussions (FDGs) and
in-depth interviews (IDIs). Process evaluations have been
reported as an essential part of community-based inter-
ventions [ 19,21], needed to provide insight on how well
programme activities are implemented, and performing
within the context in which implementation occurs [ 22].
According to Moore and colleagues [ 19], effect sizes
alone may not inform policy and implementers on how
such community-based interventions may be replicated
or reproduced in specific contexts. Moore et al. further
argued that process evaluations are needed to assess fi-
delity and quality of implementation, as well as to iden-
tify causal mechanisms and contextual factors associated
with the variations in the outcomes of interventions.Key constructs of the process evaluation
The UK MRC framework [ 21] was adopted to guide the
identification of relevant key constructs and to generate
evaluation questions in this study. According to Moore
et al. [ 19], despite a need to understand casual assump-
tions that underpin an intervention in complex interven-
tions such as the HPP project, there is also a need to
understand how the intervention worked by scrutinising
its plausibility and the relations between implementa-
tion, mechanisms of impact and context. The SMAG
intervention was regarded as complex because it com-
prised multiple interacting components and a number of
targets to be met. According to the MRC framework, an
intervention may have limited effects or positive out-
comes due to its implementation processes such as fidel-
ity, whether the intervention was implemented as
intended or the degree to which an intervention is deliv-
ered as intended; the dose; the quantity of the interven-
tion implemented; and its reach, whether the intended
audience comes into contact with the intervention or
not [ 23]. While the implementation context includes
anything external to the intervention that may act as a
barrier or facilitator to its implementation [ 19]. Further,
the mechanism of impact guides an understanding of
how an intervention was delivered and how the effects
of the intervention occurred. An illustration of these key
constructs and the assumptions on their interaction with
the intervention is provided in Fig. 1.
Existing evidence shows that the outcome of a complex
community-based intervention can be influenced by the in-
teractions between the stated three key constructs, namely
implementation, context and mechanisms [ 19,21].
Causal assumptions for the intervention
The logic ‘inputs-processes-outputs-outcomes-impact
model ’was used as a theory of change to guide the
implementation of the intervention. Figure 2describes
the inputs, outputs (activities, participation) and their
links to outcomes. Based on the model, the inputs
included implementation plans, human resources,
funding and working with district health teams. The
processes included training of SMAGs and procure-
ment of supplies, including bicycles and medicines,
and the creation of data collection tools/systems that
would facilitate the development of the community
Health Management Information Systems (HMIS).
These processes were expected to lead to short-term
results that were expressed as output indicators, such
as numbers of CHWs trained and referrals conducted.
It was also assumed that the processes of the inter-
vention would ultimately lead to medium-term out-
comes of the intervention based on baseline coverage
data, such as the proportion of mothers receiving at
least four ANC visits during pregnancy. Finally, theJacobs et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:74 Page 3 of 10
impact was the long-term goal of the project that
would include a reduction in neonatal, infant and ma-
ternal morbidity and mortality. However, it was also
noted that there would be external factors likely to
interact with this theory of change.
Study participants and sampling
Participants engaged in the intervention were purposively
sampled for in-depth interviews and focus group discus-
sions. Healthcare providers were purposively selected for
in-depth interviews based on their active involvement in
maternal and neonatal health as well as in the interven-
tion. Focus group discussions were conducted withwomen and SMAGs who were purposively selected. The
inclusion criteria for focus groups with women were
women of reproductive age, with children less than 1 year
old and living within the study community during their
most recent pregnancy. The SMAGs were included in the
study with the help of healthcare workers at the facility
level if they were above the age of 18 years, both male and
females, working within the communities under study on
the implementation of the intervention and living either
within or beyond 5 km radius from the health facility. A
total of 78 participants were interviewed, 34 SMAGs, 36
mothers and 8 healthcare providers from Samfya and
Luwingu districts.

Data collection and tools
Eight in-depth interviews were conducted with health-
care providers, using qualitative research techniques
to explore issues related to the implementation of the
intervention, such as referral practices and supervi-
sion at the community level. In addition, eight FGDs
were conducted, two from each facility. At each of
the four facilities, one FGD was with SMAGs and an-
other with mothers. Trained research assistants with
experience in qualitative studies collected the data,
1 year after the intervention. Focus group discussions
were conducted by a pair of research assistants, who
w e r eo ft h es a m eg e n d e ra n df l u e n ti nt h el o c a ll a n -
guage (Bemba). One research assistant facilitated the
sessions while the other one managed audio record-
ings and took field notes. The research assistants
u n d e r w e n ta2 - d a yt r a i n i n gp r i o rt ot h ed a t ac o l l e c -
tion and were supervised by one of the co-authors
(CJ). The data collection tools were piloted in a simi-
lar facility not included in the study (Additional file 1).
The average duration of FGDs and KIIs was 45 min. The
interviews were delivered on a face-to-face basis, at the
health facilities. Informed consent was obtained from all
the participants, and digital voice recorders were used to
document the interviews and discussions.
Data management and analysis
Recorded data were transcribed verbatim, and translated
from Bemba to English, supplemented with field notes.
All transcripts were assigned a unique identifier and
imported into NVivo 13 for data management and ana-
lysis. Data was coded by two individuals, a trained re-
search assistant and one of the co-authors (CJ). An
iterative inductive thematic approach [ 24] was used
through repeated rounds of reading and re-reading to
clarify coding differences and to ensure consistency for
subsequent analyses. Coders first independently listened
to some recordings, reviewed a sample of the transcripts
and began to formulate draft codes and themes. The re-
searchers then met after coding the first six interviews
to discuss the coding. Discrepancies were discussed until
consensus was reached. Coding meetings with the re-
search team and an experienced research assistant were
held every week to create a mutual understanding of
codes and refine the coding framework. The two coders
examined and assigned sections of text to codes, repre-
senting themes or subthemes. Extracts of data were
coded and memos were written to record emerging im-
pressions of the data. Coded data extracts were further
discussed among all the authors and merged into cat-
egories before refining them into themes. To further ver-
ify our results, we returned to the raw data. To enhance
study validity, triangulation of different data sources
(FGDs and IDIs) between different respondent groupswas done by cross-examining the data [ 25,26]. Triangu-
lation is a recognised method to increase the credibility
of data analysis [ 25]. This was achieved through data tri-
angulation whereby the perspectives of the different re-
spondent groups were explored. We also maintained a
detailed audit trail of all decisions through a codebook,
coding discussions and meetings.
Results
A total of 78 participants were interviewed, 34 SMAGs, 36
mothers and 8 healthcare providers from two rural districts.
The majority of the SMAGs were female (59%) with an age
range of 24 to 71 years. All the SMAGs (100%) received
training on safe motherhood skills before the intervention
and were working in the commu nity. Three out the eight
healthcare providers (38%) were female; one of them was a
community health assistant and another a classified daily
employee. The mothers ’age range was 19 to 46 years; none
of them reported that they have never been to school, and
the majority (64%) had not completed primary education.
Thematic areas
On the whole, SMAGs were able to implement the
intended intervention, by identifying pregnant women
and encouraging them to attend ANC visits, assisting
with birth preparedness plans and clinic attendance for
skilled birth assistance as well as postnatal care. In
addition, SMAGs were able to refer women with compli-
cations in pregnancy and following delivery, as well as
doing follow-up visits for those under their care and
submitting the necessary written reports. However, the
following themes under the three major constructs of
implementation process were found to potentially influ-
ence the implementation of the intervention and likely
to explain the failure to meet outcome targets: service
shortages, geographic barriers, socio-cultural factors and
implications of personalising care (see Fig. 3).

Implementation processes
Service shortages
Lack of supervision Most SMAGs expressed concern
over lack of supervision and refresher courses from
the health facility and district health staff. They indi-
cated that supportive supervision was only provided
in the initial phases of the SMAG programme, which
was demotivating and a cause of dropout for some
SMAGs.
When the programme started in 2013, they used to
come and check on us. But nowadays we just work
with the staff. Otherwise, there is no support
provided to us, and others end up withdrawing.
(Mother: FGD3:1)
Lack of equipment SMAGS also reported that lack of
protective clothing such as gumboots, raincoats and
torches made movements at night or during the rainy
season challenging. These additional supplies would
have assisted SMAGs to work more efficiently through
the nights and rains.
Yes ......these are things that we lack and without
these, our work is very challenging, things like
raincoats, torches because they [patients] come to
wake us up in the night to escort them. (SMAG:
FGD2: 2:7)
Shortage of staff The respondents reported that lack of
skilled health personnel in some facilities made the work
of SMAGs more difficult in that some women in the
community did not see any benefit of being referred to a
health centre where there was no skilled personnel.
We have a problem because some women do not see
any need of going to the facility only to be attended
by someone who is not a nurse, and especially a
young man. (SMAG: FGD2:2:2)
Conduct of deliveries Discussion with respondents re-
vealed that SMAGs conducted deliveries in the health
facilities. According to most healthcare providers, the
SMAGs were a relief in facilities when healthcare pro-
viders were overwhelmed with work or not available.
Ah for delivery, usually they [SMAGs] refer clients
to clinic, but when I am not at the facility since I
am alone, they [SMAGs] do conduct deliveries.
(HCW: IDI1:1)SMAGs were seen to have taken over the roles of
TBAs, which made it harder for healthcare providers
and community members to shift their expectations, and
in fact, expected SMAGs to do the work of the TBAs.
It is hard to differentiate the care given by SMAGs
from that of TBAs because it is like their roles have
been mixed …yes uh, the SMAGs are doing the roles
of the TBAs. (HCW: IDI2:1)
Implementation context
Geographic barriers
Referral to clinics Distance to the health facility, poor
road conditions and inadequate transport to the health
facility emerged as prominent challenges that hindered
SMAGs ’ability to refer women to the health facilities for
skilled care.
The points that my sisters have said are true, we have
a challenge here because some of our areas are very
far......... others have to cross two streams, they live
very far where there is no SMAG. So the point here is
that we have to sacrifice to go and see them, and if
you don ’t have a bicycle to use it is a problem.
(SMAG: FGD2:3:3)
Means of transport The need for SMAGs to transport
pregnant women to the health facility, and the difficulty
thereof, hampered their ability to promote skilled deliv-
eries in health facilities. A female SMAG respondent
confirmed that some communities were more than 4 h
walk to the health facility.
Some of them are within the clinic catchment area of
Ndoki, but others take about 4 hours walking to reach
here so if there is no bicycle you walk with a pregnant
woman, imagine the challenge. (SMAG: FDG2: 1:1)
All the SMAG respondents stated that bicycles, a
major means of transport that was used in the commu-
nities, were either not available or were inadequate since
these were shared among all the SMAGs in the
community.
Socio-cultural factors
Gender roles An intended gender-neutral role for
SMAGs, which entails similar roles between male and fe-
male SMAGs, was reported as a challenge for effective
provision of referral services by the SMAGs. Male SMAGs
expressed concern that some mo thers, particularly thoseJacobs et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:74 Page 6 of 10
unmarried, found it difficult to seek care from a male
SMAG on pregnancy or childbirth-related issues and needs.
Male SMAGs, therefore, preferred to send female SMAGs
to young unmarried mothers to identify problems.
Just as someone said, most women who get pregnant
and are not married feel shy to come and tell a male
SMAG, so we send a female SMAG to see her. Then
that female SMAG will now come and tell us what
the problem is. (SMAG: FGD1:2:8)
Gender preferences Healthcare providers confirmed the
SMAGs ’assertions over gender preferences by mothers
and that male referrals are few and far in between, which
may indicate the compromised effectiveness of male
SMAGs in their role compared to female SMAGs.
Yes, in fact even referrals that I usually receive most
of them are those that are referred by female SMAGs,
as for male SMAGS, I think it takes a year ah...ah it
can happen once a year. (HCW: 1DI2:4)
Bearers of ‘life and death ’reports When SMAGs
escorted a woman for facility deliveries, they had to wait for
the women to deliver. The long hours and sometimes days
of waiting were a challenge to the roles of SMAGs. When
asked why they waited, most SMAGs explained that com-
munities viewed them as bearers of ‘life and death ’news.
Concerning waiting for the woman until she is
discharged, you get worried because pregnancy is a
matter of life and death. So this makes us wait until a
woman delivers because once the family members
hear that the woman has delivered, they become
relieved. That is why she is saying we wait.
(SMAG: FGD1:2:6)
Mechanism of impact
Personalising care
Going beyond the call of duty SMAGs provided perso-
nalised care beyond their role in the intervention. The
personalised care included among others house chores
and marital counselling. These extended roles were out-
side their prescribed scope of work but appreciated by
the pregnant women whose physical conditions necessi-
tated support. One of the mothers said:
When they come to visit us they bring us food
and even draw for [us] water just like that.
(Mother: FGD2:1:3)Addressing personal problems SMAGs were regarded
as individuals who could not only handle some of their
health needs but also mothers ’personal problems. Some
mothers indicated that the trust they had in SMAGs
motivated them to seek advice from the SMAGs. One of
the mothers had this to say:
We trust them, which is why we go to them. Even
if you are quarrelling at home, we get up and go to
the SMAG. When you are pregnant, and tell them
listen, my husband has failed to prepare. Come and
teach him so that he knows how to prepare the
clothes for the baby, because others are drunkards.
(Mother: FGD3:9)
Use of personal resources Sometimes, the SMAGs had
to use their personal resources to meet some costs such
as transport costs to get the mothers to the health facil-
ities. Most women and their families could hardly afford
decent clothing for their newborn baby because of
poverty.
Sometimes, a woman and her husband may not even
have things for the baby, so you the SMAG have to
give them a chitenge or a nappy. So that money has
to be paid for by us SMAGs just to help our friends to
deliver on time. (SMAG: FGD1:1:6)
In such circumstances, the SMAGs would take up the
responsibility of securing clothing for the newborn baby,
and related requirements, just to overcome the barrier
and get women to the health facility. These expenses
made it difficult for the SMAGs, as they themselves were
also poor.
Discussion
The current study, a process evaluation approach, was
designed to provide insights into explanatory mecha-
nisms for the variations observed between actual and
targeted outcomes for MNH services, ANC and SBA,
following a SMAG community-based intervention in
Zambia. We found, firstly, that SMAGs implemented
much of the intervention as was intended, particularly
education of women and referral to health facilities for
ANC, SBA, PNC and complications. Secondly, SMAGs
went above and beyond their prescribed roles to assist
women with household chores and personal problems
and even used their own resources to support needy
households, so as to enhance the success of their work.
Thirdly, SMAGs reported what could be regarded as de-
ficiencies in the intervention itself, due to poor ongoing
support, inadequate supplies and lack of effective trans-
portation needed to enable success in their work, leadingJacobs et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:74 Page 7 of 10
to attrition of SMAGs from the intervention. Fourthly,
the beneficiaries did not perceive the intervention to be
gender-neutral as was assumed during intervention de-
sign; in that, mothers preferred to disclose their health
issues to female SMAGs rather than male SMAGs,
thereby compromising the intensity of the intervention.
Lastly, factors external to the intervention may have
compromised the results, particularly the inadequacy of
health services in facilities where SMAGs referred
mothers, made worse by the long distances and difficult
terrain women had to travel in the company of SMAGs.
The health facility-related service deficiencies led
SMAGs to engage in the unintended role of conducting
deliveries. Some SMAGs were also known to be TBAs,
whose birth attendance activities have been terminated
despite their many years of experience in assisting births
in the communities. Previous studies have indicated that
SMAGs were chosen from the existing TBAs and other
community health volunteer [ 27,28]. However, health
workers allowed SMAGs known to have worked as
TBAs to conduct deliveries in the health facility when
facilities experienced absenteeism, shortages or work
pressure. The unintended consequence of hiring previ-
ous TBAs meant that SMAGs could conduct deliveries
in health facilities, but these were not recognised as
skilled attendance, even though some of these deliveries
may have been performed under the supervision of
nurses. Such implementation mechanisms could explain
the failure of the SMAG intervention to meet the set
targets for SBA. The role confusion between activities of
SMAGs and TBAs should be considered in future inter-
ventions to avoid unintended consequences [ 29]. Enhan-
cing strategies that provide awareness of the specific
roles of CHWs is critical to guide expectations of com-
munities and healthcare providers towards the specific
services in community-based interventions [ 30]. We also
suggest the critical need of ensuring availability of skilled
personnel in health facilities to avoid similar unintended
consequences of SMAGs [ 31].
Further, the findings in this study are consistent with
the studies in Zambia and elsewhere [ 28,29], which have
highlighted the importance of recruiting SMAGs within
their communities where they are trusted and preferred.
The SMAGs ’unique position and moral authority within
these communities had the potential to influence out-
comes to the intervention positively [ 28,29,32–34]
given their existing social networks [ 28,29] and inclin-
ation to be natural helpers through personalised care
provision [ 35]. However, provision of personalised care
by SMAGs also meant going beyond their scope and
using their own personal resources, an indication of the
inadequacy of the health system and a threat to optimal
provision of referral services, a key component of the
SMAGs intervention. Use of personal resources byCHWs has been reported in other rural studies that also
involved referral or community members to health facil-
ities [ 36]. For the SMAG intervention to function and be
sustainable, empowering CHWs with financial incentives
appears to be critical in order to enable them to effect-
ively provide their services and meet needs of commu-
nity members in rural and poor communities [ 37,38].
The remoteness of rural communities has been reported
in other studies as a barrier to mothers ’ability to reach
the healthcare facilities [ 5,39–41]. These findings sug-
gested the need for effective and sustainable means of
transport in community-based interventions designed to
improve access by linking communities to the health
system through SMAGs [ 42].
In these remote areas, women found it easier to disclose
pregnancy-related issues to female SMAGs than male
SMAGs, as healthcare occurs within cultural-bound
norms and sensitive socio-cultural factors, often more
common in remote rural communities [ 43,44]. The find-
ings thus suggest a need for gendered SMAG roles [ 45]
and male-female task sharing functions if MNH services
are to be optimised for marginalised women in remote
and hard-to-reach areas. Feldhaus et al. argued that
pairing male and female SMAGs may potentially address
and accommodate gender preferences among SMAGs for
pregnancy-related issues [ 46]. All in all, these findings
highlight the interrelationships between the contextual
factors and the implementation processes of the
intervention.
However, this study has potential limitations that
should be noted. Firstly, the collection of data for this
process evaluation was conducted after the outcome
analysis, which may have been compromised by recall
bias in retrospectively reconstructing events, and a pro-
spective process evaluation design would have been
more preferable. Secondly, self-reported accounts of
intervention fidelity in this study are prone to bias and
may have lower reliability than observational measures
[47]. However, the adoption of a data triangulation ap-
proach was intended to allow for validation of findings
from different sets of participants. Thirdly, data for this
study was collected from respondents who were still ac-
tive as SMAGs, and therefore not representative views
from inactive SMAGs.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found evidence suggesting that although
SMAGs continue to play pivotal roles in contribution to-
wards accelerated coverage of maternal and neonatal
health services among hard-to-reach populations, they are
unable to meet some of the critical sets of MNH service
targeted indicators. Complexities of the implementation
mechanisms coupled with the presence of differential set-
ting specific social, cultural and geographical contextualJacobs et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:74 Page 8 of 10
factors could partly explain this failure. More specifically,
we think that deficiencies in the implementation mecha-
nisms and the factors external to the SMAG intervention
such as the health services inadequacy of skilled health-
care providers in facilities where SMAGs referred mothers
as well as poor geographical access may have led SMAGs
to engage in the unintended role of conducting deliveries.
This could have compromised the performance of the
SMAGs and led to the failure to meet the set targets for
key MNH service indicators among women in the most
rural and remote communities. These observations point
to limitations in past and existing efforts to improve
MNCH health service delivery. There is thus need to
innovate and re-package existing implementation strat-
egies, such as recruiting adequate health care providers
and ensure adequate provision of logistics and equipment,
so as to help SMAGs and any other community health
systems champions to effectively respond to MNH needs
of most-at-risk women and promote universal health
coverage targeting hard-to-reach groups. If this is done
correctly, policy and programme managers will be armed
with systems and strategies that adequately and appropri-
ately match the complex nature of the implementation
mechanisms and external contextual factors that hinder
successful implementation of community-based interven-
tions such as SMAGs in hard-to-reach areas.
