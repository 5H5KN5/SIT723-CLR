Abstract
Background: Development of physical literacy, defined as “the motivation, confidence, physical competence,
knowledge and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life, ”can
support children ’s physically active behaviors and consequent health benefits. Little research has explored
interventions to improve children ’s physical literacy, although substantive evidence shows parents play a key role in
children ’s physically active behaviors and development of fundamental movement skills. The purpose of this study
was to explore the feasibility of a novel, physical literacy program (the PLAYshop) designed to build parents ’self-
efficacy to support their child ’s physical literacy.
Methods: A non-randomized, one-arm concurrent nested design was used. Thirty-five parents of young children
(3–8 years of age) attended a 75-min workshop inclusive of interactive activities, educational messages, and the
provision of resources focused on core physical literacy concepts. Pre- and post-workshop surveys used quantitative
measures to assess parents ’satisfaction, knowledge, confidence, and intention to adopt practices. Follow-up
interviews qualitatively explored the implementation experiences of both parents and facilitators. Paired ttests and
thematic analysis were undertaken.
Results: Of the 33 eligible parents, 23 completed both pre- and post-workshop surveys. Follow-up interviews were
completed with 11 parents and four workshop facilitators. Parents ’self-reported knowledge and confidence to
support their child ’s physical literacy development significantly increased after PLAYshop participation. The majority
of parents were satisfied with the workshop and motivated to apply learnings at home with their child. Workshop
facilitators identified seven workshop strengths (e.g., workshop champions and skilled facilitators) and four
challenges (e.g., recruitment and unfavorable spaces). Limitations include the lack of control group and recruitment
challenges.

Conclusions: The PLAYshop was perceived positively by parents and facilitators and appeared to improve parent
self-efficacy and intention to promote physical literacy with their child. Recruitment and attendance were key
implementation challenges. The findings from this real-world study support the preliminary feasibility of the
PLAYshop intervention and highlight areas to improve the intervention and recruitment prior to efficacy testing in
a more rigorous trial format.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15What uncertainties existed regarding the
feasibility ?The feasibility of a potentially scalable
childhood physical literacy workshop intervention
that targets parents (specifically to enhance their
knowledge and self-efficacy, and to increase pur-
poseful play to enhance their child ’s physical liter-
acy) is currently unknown. In addition,
the implementation feasibility in terms of recruit-
ment and delivery is unknown.
/C15What are the key feasibility findings? Thirty-five
parents were recruited to attend 1 of 6 parent work-
shops and 23 completed all evaluation components.
The PLAYshop was acceptable to parents with
95.4% and 95.5% satisfied or extremely satisfied with
the workshop content and delivery, respectively.
Nearly all parents were highly motivated to imple-
ment activities after the workshop and significant
improvements in knowledge, confidence, and self-
reported practices resulted. Recruitment and reten-
tion of parents for follow-up measures need to be
addressed to ensure the success of a full trial.
/C15What are the implications of the feasibility
findings for the design of the main study? The
intervention was well received by parents. Parents
require more support after the workshop.
Implementation may be supported with an
additional workshop leader. Future trials should
expand recruitment efforts and recruit parents
directly.
Background
Physical activity is critically important to the development of
young children as it improves cognitive and motor skill de-
velopment, psychosocial health, social connectedness, and
cardiometabolic health and reduces adiposity [ 10,34]a n d
risk of chronic disease in adulthood [ 11]. Unfortu-
nately the prevalence of childre n participating in sufficient
levels of physical activity is low internationally [ 1]. In re-
sponse, researchers have developed and tested the effective-
ness of numerous childhood phys ical activity interventions
[22]. Amidst some success, their impact on children ’s levelsof physical activit y appears limited [ 23] and several research
gaps remain.
Physical literacy offers a relatively new and promising ap-
proach for childhood physi cal activity interventions [ 9]. It is
defined by the International Phy sical Literacy Association as
“the motivation, confidence, p hysical competence, knowledge
and understanding to value and take responsibility for en-
gagement in physical activities for life ”[18]. The novelty of
physical literacy lies in the equal importance assigned to four
key domains: affective (motivation and confidence), cognitive
(knowledge and understanding), social (relationships and so-
cial networks), and physical c apabilities (e.g., motor skill
competence and fundamental movement skills [FMS]) [ 13,
30]. Physical literacy is an antecedent to improve and main-
tain physical activity partic ipation and consequent health
benefits [ 9,13], thus it is particularly important to begin de-
velopment early in the life course [ 32]. Parents ’meaningful
engagement in this physical li teracy journey is considered
critical [ 32] due to their influence on their child ’sp h y s i c a l
activity-related behaviors; su pported by systematic review
evidence.
In a 2016 systematic review of family-based physical ac-
tivity interventions, 31 of the 47 included studies demon-
strated a significant positive effect on children ’sp h y s i c a l
activity levels [ 8]. More specifically, a systematic review of
the determinants of physical activity in children aged 0 –6
years found that parent monitoring was the only factor
consistently associated with children ’s physical activity
[16,17]. Lastly, a synthesis of results from 39 high-quality
reviews [ 22] provided strong evidence that parents play a
key role in promoting child physical activity across various
community settings. Rhodes and colleagues [ 28]f u r t h e r
explored this topic in a recent systematic review of the
correlates of parental support on child physical activity.
Out of the twenty correlates identified in 19 unique data
sets, co-participation, logistical support, and encourage-
ment were the most common elements of interventions
with a positive effect on children ’s physical activity levels.
Although these previous systematic reviews did not re-
port on physical literacy, many of the included studies ex-
amined parent-focused interventions that
emphasized FMS —a key part of physical literacy [ 5,36]
often used synonymously [ 13]. For example, the 3-month
Healthy Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) program adoptedLane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:113 Page 2 of 12
FMS as the exclusive focus for one of the four, 75-min
father/child practical sessions [ 25,26]. Similarly, the 8-
week Dads and Daughters Exercising and Empowered
(DADEE) program [ 27]a n dt h em o t h e r - d a u g h t e r
MADE4Life program [ 3] each devoted at least one prac-
tical session to FMS. FMS was an explicit outcome meas-
ure within only one intervention trial: a 2018 randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of DADEE that found significant
improvements in daughters ’FMS proficiency [ 27]. FMS
competence was objectively assessed via scores of daugh-
ters’performance in six object control skills (kicking,
catching, striking a stationary ball, stationary dribble, over-
hand throw, and underhand throw). Compared to con-
trols, daughters in the intervention had significantly
higher object control scores post-intervention ( p<.001)
that were sustained at 9-month follow-up ( p≤.002).
Positive findings for physical activity-related outcomes
were found in trials of all interventions: fathers in DADEE
significantly improved in physical activity parenting prac-
tices compared to controls [ 27]; children in HDHK signifi-
cantly increased in level of physical activity compared to
controls [ 25,26]; and mothers in MADE4Life reported
positive behavior change as a result of the program [ 3].
Further, all of these programs appeared feasible, with high
attendance and ratings of program satisfaction made by
fathers in HDHK [ 25,26] and DADEE [ 27], as well as high
ratings of program quality and session content made by
mothers in MADE4Life [ 3].
These parent-focused interventions inclusive of FMS
appear to have a meaningful impact on children ’s phys-
ical activity. However, they required a significant time
commitment from parents (multiple sessions over the
course of 2 –3 months) and were resource-intensive. A
simplified intervention may be more accessible for time-
restricted parents and be more amenable for scale-up
[35]. It is also unclear whether the aforementioned inter-
ventions had any impact on parent self-efficacy —an im-
portant component of behavior change [ 2] also linked to
children ’s physical activity levels [ 31].
Increasing parent self-efficacy (knowledge, confidence,
and capacity) to carry out activities that promote phys-
ical literacy may provide children with a foundation for
development in this area. No research to date has ex-
plored a brief parent-focused physical literacy program
as an intervention option. In light of this evidence gap,
we developed a novel theory-based program (the PLAY-
shop) that aimed to build parents ’self-efficacy in assist-
ing their child to develop physical literacy and acquire
physical activity through play. The PLAYshop was ori-
ginally designed by a lead member of the research team
in partnership with a representative from a community
physical literacy agency (Pacific Institute for Sport Excel-
lence; PISE). It was first tested in two community set-
tings to explore the approach (core physical literacycontent, theoretically driven behavior change, and adult
education techniques) and feasibility of the format (re-
cruitment, delivery model, etc.). The intervention was
then refined for preliminary evaluation in a research
context. It was designed with the intent to be scaled up
if proven effective within a fully powered efficacy trial, as
per WHO recommendations [ 35].
Before investment in a definitive efficacy and/or effect-
iveness trial of the PLAYshop, it is important to deter-
mine whether the intervention is feasible —that is,
“whether the future trial can be done, should be done,
and, if so, how ”[14]. The overarching goal of the study
presented in this paper was to explore the preliminary
feasibility of the PLAYshop via assessing its limited effi-
cacy (does the intervention lead to outcomes that are
moving in the intended direction) and acceptability (the
reaction of those involved with the intervention) [ 7].
The specific objectives used to achieve this goal were as
follows:
1. To assess parents ’knowledge and confidence
relating to key physical literacy constructs after
participating in the PLAYshop;
2. To explore parents ’experiences and perspectives
including their satisfaction with, and perceived
usefulness of, the program;
3. To explore program delivery and potential areas of
improvement from the perspective of facilitators.
Methods
Study design
Six physical literacy workshops (the PLAYshop) were de-
livered at different times in schools ( n=4) and sports clubs
(n=2) within two Canadian jurisdictions. This non-
randomized study used a one-arm, concurrent nested ap-
proach with quantitative data collected through pre- and
post-workshop surveys and qualitative data collected
through follow-up telephone interviews of parents and
PLAYshop facilitators. Human research ethics approval
for the study was obtained from the University of Victoria
(#16-444) and University of Alberta (#00093764). As per
recommendations [ 19], the following study methods are
reported in accordance with the applicable items from the
CONSORT statement for pilot and feasibility trials [ 14].
Participants and recruitment
The sampling pool consisted of approximately 1500 fam-
ilies of younger elementary aged-children (estimated
based on sizes of school classes and number of sport
club members). No sample size calculations were under-
taken as the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility
prior to a future trial [ 14]. Parents (fathers and/or
mothers) or guardians of young children (ideally 3 –8
years of age) were invited to participate in theLane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:113 Page 3 of 12
PLAYshop using e-flyers distributed through the com-
munity networks of the schools and local sports clubs.
E-flyers provided contact information of the research
team responsible for recruitment, workshop scheduling,
and evaluation. Parents who responded to recruitment
materials were invited to attend a scheduled workshop
and siblings of any age were welcome to join and be in-
volved. All parents that showed up on the delivery day
were provided with a brief description of the study and
invited to participate in the evaluation component. In-
terested parents were asked to provide written informed
consent. Data were obtained from only one parent per
family. For example, mothers and fathers of the same
family were both welcome to participate in a workshop;
however, only one was asked to complete evaluation as-
sessments. Facilitators (that were also members of the
study team) were asked if they were interested in partici-
pating in an interview about workshop implementation
after all scheduled workshops were completed and if so
were asked to provide written informed consent in-
person or via email. No personal data was collected from
the facilitators.
Intervention
The PLAYshop involved one face-to-face 75-min group
workshop and the provision of educational materials.
Workshops were delivered to a maximum of 30 parents in
community settings by the lead researcher and/or a
trained graduate student (each of whom held degrees in
physical and health education). The lead researcher had
experience in the development of physical literacy and
physical activity habits, community-based health promo-
tion, and adult education techniques. The graduate stu-
dent workshop facilitator was trained by the lead
researcher, had completed a 2-h physical literacy educa-
tion session, and was included in an embedded profes-
sional development workshop training approach prior to
delivering a full workshop. Facilitator training included
first workshop observation, then incremental responsibil-
ity (delivering portions of the workshop under the super-
vision of the lead researcher), and lastly the delivery
of significant worskhop portions under supervision.
Workshop format and content were guided by the work-
shop template that was developed by the lead researcher
in collaboration with community physical literacy experts
(PISE) using evidence-based behavior change techniques
[24], adult education and training practices, as well as rec-
ommendations and material from international experts in
physical literacy development [ 32,33].
The aim of the PLAYshop program was threefold: (i)
to enhance parents ’understanding of physical activity
and physical literacy and their role in facilitating it, (ii)
to expose parents to a number of activities and resources
that could help them support the development of a widerange of movement skills and increase physical activity,
and (iii) to increase parents ’confidence in facilitating
playful activities by engaging them in the activities (ex-
periential learning) and providing key messages and
modeling approaches that align with, and promote the
development of, physical literacy (competence, motiv-
ation, confidence, and valuing physical activity).
We employed a systematic process of program design
based on Bandura ’s social cognitive theory (SCT) [ 2] and
the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW; a synthesis of 19 be-
havior change frameworks) [ 24]. Several constructs of
SCT (e.g., observational learning, reinforcement, and in-
tentions) were targeted throughout intervention design,
as well as development of program components and data
collection tools. Our primary focus was self-efficacy —a
construct unique to SCT that aligned with our aim to
improve parent ’s knowledge and confidence to perform
target behaviors.
The BCW was employed to identify specific strategies
to support parents to adopt target behaviors to facilitate
cross-jurisdiction knowledge exchange. First, we identi-
fied possible barriers and/or enablers to parent ’s pur-
poseful play with their child via reviews of the literature
and discourse with parents during the development
workshops and among the research team. Examples of
identified factors that may influence parents to adopt
target behaviors include time [ 16,17,21], available re-
sources [ 16,17], and confidence [ 31]. We then classified
each factor according to the COM-B model as either
capability, opportunity, or motivation. A program logic
model is provided in Fig. 1, and the behavior change
techniques to address the identified barriers and en-
ablers are detailed in Table 1.
Data collection
Quantitative data
Pre- and post-workshop surveys of parents collected in-
formation about demographics and key study outcomes
relating to study objectives 1 and 2. Surveys were devel-
oped for the study by the research team and guided by
SCT [ 2]. The outcome measures used to assess study ob-
jective 1 were (a) parent knowledge of physical literacy
and its key components (physical literacy; locomotor
skills, manipulative skills, balance and stability, facilitat-
ing physical activities) and (b) parent confidence in pro-
moting physical literacy (providing opportunities for
exploration and free play, adapting activities for child ’s
age/ability, creating a home environment that encour-
ages physical activity, and limiting sedentary behaviors).
Instrument sub-scales were adapted from the Activity
Support Scale for Multiple Groups (ACTS-MG) [ 12] and
the ParticipACTION Family Physical Activity Question-
naire (Ryan E [ 29].). Questions used 5-point Likert scale
items to measure both parent knowledge (1= noLane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:113 Page 4 of 12
knowledge to 5= a lot of knowledge) and parent confi-
dence (1= no confidence to 5 = a lot of confidence). Par-
ents completed the pre-workshop survey by pen and
paper during a 5 –10-min period allocated at the start of
the workshop. During this time, children and parentsthat did not complete a survey were offered the oppor-
tunity to engage in active games led by the facilitator.
The post-workshop survey included an additional sec-
tion on parents ’workshop experience (study objective 2)
with questions relating to parents ’satisfaction withFig. 1 PLAYshop program logic model and components included within the feasibility study phase

workshop delivery, whether the content was new to
them, and the usefulness of training. This survey was
emailed to parents 1 day after their attendance in a
workshop with a request to return a completed version
via email as soon as possible (with follow-up reminders).
Qualitative data
Interviews of parents and facilitators were used to address
study objectives 2 and 3, respectively. A member of the re-
search team conducted 10 –15-min semi-structured follow-
up interviews of parents approximately 2 months after work-
shop delivery (follow-up). This time period was chosen to
provide parents sufficient time to implement a number of
workshop activities with their child and to determine the
level of implementation over the short term. Parent inter-
views were composed of open-ended questions to assess the
amenability with workshop t eachings, the applicability of
workshop content, and the ease and/or barriers to imple-
menting learnings with their child/children (study objective
2). A researcher independen t of the PLAYshop conducted
10–15-min semi-structured interviews with facilitators within
6 months of the completion of all scheduled workshops. Fa-
cilitator interviews used open -ended questions to assess the
enablers and barriers to workshop implementation, as well as
explore possible modificatio ns to enhance workshop efficacy
and useful components that should remain unchanged
(study objective 3).
Data analysis
Quantitative data
SPSS Version 21.0 was used to analyze all quantitative
data. Demographics and descriptive statistics described
the population and baseline levels of knowledge, confi-
dence, and motivation. Paired ttests were conducted to
calculate the mean changes in parents ’physical literacy
knowledge and confidence from baseline to follow-up
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Statistical
significance was defined as p<0.05. Measures of fre-
quency (expressed as valid percentages) were calculated
to analyze parents ’satisfaction with workshop content
and delivery and post-workshop intent to participate in
physical activities with their children.
Qualitative data
Qualitative data were analyzed following the principles
of framework analysis detailed by Gale and colleagues
[15]. Two researchers generated themes for parent and
facilitator interviews using the following steps: (1) co-
coding a subset of transcripts, (2) generating a flexible
coding framework, (3) applying this framework to subse-
quent transcripts, (4) assigning codes to categories, and
(5) developing these into themes and sub-themes. The
research pair discussed and reached agreeance on any
variability that arose during this process. Whereconsensus could not be achieved, a third member of the
research team assisted in final decisions.
Results
Sample
Thirty-five parents participated in a workshop. There
were two cases in which both parents attended the
workshop therefore only one parent from each family
was asked to participate in the study evaluation compo-
nent. All 33 eligible parents provided consent and com-
pleted the pre-workshop survey (mean age=38.45 years;
24.2% male, 75.8% female); however, 10 did not return
the emailed post-workshop survey. Only data from the
23 parents who completed surveys at both time points
were included for analysis. Eleven parents also com-
pleted the 2-month follow-up telephone interview; the
remainder either declined to participate or was unreach-
able by phone. The average number of children per
household was 1.85. All four PLAYshop facilitators pro-
vided consent and completed the facilitator interview.
Objective 1 —Parents ’knowledge and confidence
Valid quantitative data for comparison were obtained
from pre- and post-workshop surveys completed by 23
parents. Paired ttest analysis showed a significant in-
crease across all measures of parents ’self-reported
knowledge from pre- to post-workshop ( p≤0.02). Please
see Fig. 2. Parents ’mean level of knowledge significantly
improved for physical literacy ( −1.25 [SD=1.42], t(11)=
−3.05, p=0.011, 95% CI= −2.15 to −0.35), locomotor skills
(−1.14, [SD=0.96], t(20)= −5.44, p=0.000, 95% CI= −1.58
to−0.70), manipulative skills (e.g., catching, striking,
kicking, hitting, throwing) ( −1.0 [SD=1.21], t(19)= −3.68,
p=0.002, 95% CI= −1.57 to −0.43), balance and stability
(−0.95 [SD=1.16], t(20)= −3.76, p=0.001, 95% CI= −1.48
to−0.42), and facilitating physical activities ( −0.81 [SD=
1.21], t(20)= −3.07, p=0.02, 95% CI= −1.36 to −0.26).
Paired ttest analysis also showed a significant increase
across all measures of parents ’self-reported level of con-
fidence for initiating and implementing physical literacy
activities with their children from pre- to post-workshop
(p≤0.009). Please see Fig. 3. Significant improvements
were found for parents ’mean level of confidence to pro-
vide their child with opportunities for exploration and
free play −0.55 [SD=0.76], t(19)= −3.24, p=0.004, 95%
CI=−0.91 to −0.20), to adapt physical activities for differ-
ent ages and abilities ( −1.00 [SD=0.86], t(19)= −5.21, p=
0.000, 95% CI= −1.40 to −0.60), to create a home envir-
onment that encourages physical activity ( −0.71 [SD=
0.72], t(20)= −4.56, p=0.000, 95% CI= −1.04 to −0.39),
and to limit sedentary behaviors such as screen time and
prolonged sitting ( −0.48 [SD=0.75], t(20)= −2.91, p=
0.009, 95% CI= −0.82 to −0.14).Lane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:113 Page 6 of 12

Objective 2 —Parents ’experiences
Of the 23 parents who completed post-workshop sur-
veys, the majority reported that they were satisfied or ex-
tremely satisfied with the workshop content (95.4%) and
delivery (95.5%), with no parent reporting anything less
than somewhat satisfied (range 3 –5). Most parents also
found the workshop training very to extremely useful
(81.8%). The workshop content was reported as “some-
what new ”by 49% of parents and “very new ”by 28.6%.
Most parents (95.6%) agreed or strongly agreed that they
were motivated to do physical activity with their children
within 2 weeks of the workshop delivery, and 73.9% dis-
agreed or strongly disagreed that performing physical ac-
tivities with their child/children within 2 weeks of the
workshop would be difficult.
Thematic analysis of the follow-up semi-structured in-
terviews of parents ( n=11) identified five key themes in
relation to implementing the physical literacy activities
and concepts (Table 2). Sub-themes are also displayed
with illustrative parent quotes. Prominent facilitators
were the ease of access/simplicity of activities introduced
in the PLAYshop and the enthusiasm of children. An-
other prominent theme was life barriers getting in the
way (i.e., time, routine, and motivation). Parents further
suggested that having children of varying developmental
stages and receding memories of workshop content over
time may pose as an obstacle to using lessons from the
PLAYshop.
Objective 3 —Facilitator feedback
Thematic analysis of the semi-structured interviews of
workshop facilitators generated two major categories —
one relating to strengths and successes (see Table 3) and
one relating to challenges and areas for improvement
(see Table 4). Each major category was divided into
seven themes and four themes, respectively, with some
themes fitting within both. For instance, the presence of
a champion assisted in the success of some workshopswhile the absence of a champion appeared as a key chal-
lenge for others. Similarly, children attending the work-
shops served as both a challenge (occasional distraction)
and strength (assisted with experiential learning and re-
cruitment), and space for movement also served as ei-
ther a challenge (inadequate space) or strength (ample
space). Facilitator expertise, workshop content, and par-
ents’positive response to the workshop all emerged as
workshop strengths while the need to support parents
after the workshop emerged as an area for improvement.
Discussion
We conducted a small, uncontrolled study to assess the
preliminary feasibility (limited efficacy and acceptability
[7]) of a brief, parent-focused childhood physical literacy
intervention. The theory-based PLAYshop aimed to en-
hance the knowledge, confidence, skills, and resources
necessary to support parents to assist their child to de-
velop physical literacy through play. The findings were
positive, demonstrating that the intervention was feasible
(highly acceptable and easy to implement) and poten-
tially efficacious; however, program recruitment was
challenging and areas for improvement in implementa-
tion were identified.
The PLAYshop shows promise as an early childhood
physical literacy intervention option for building parents ’
knowledge and self-efficacy for playing purposefully with
their child to develop physical literacy and physical ac-
tivity. Compared to pre-workshop measures, post-
workshop surveys of parents immediately following pro-
gram delivery showed significantly higher levels of
knowledge in key physical literacy variables and confi-
dence in undertaking physical-literacy promoting activ-
ities with their child/children. Further, the majority of
parents were highly motivated to apply learnings from

purposeful play with their child/children at home report-
edly increased following participation in a workshop.
Consistent with findings of prior research [ 3,25–
27], our results suggest that a brief training workshop
may positively influence parenting practices with re-
gard to physical literacy. Other studies have shown
that the home environment impacts the motor skill
development of children [ 4,36] and RCTs have fur-
ther linked parent-focused interventions with im-
provements in child ’sF M S[ 27] and physical activity
[25–27]. This has important implications seeing as
physical literacy is a lifelong journey that impacts nu-
merous health outcomes [ 9]. Parent training andeducation may provide a viable means of influencing
the physical literacy journey early in the life course.
According to our results, the PLAYshop also appeared
acceptable from the perspective of those involved. The
majority of parents reported that they were “highly satis-
fied”with the program. Interviews of parents and work-
shop facilitators highlighted numerous strengths relating
to the PLAYshop content and delivery, including its use-
fulness, convenience and ability to elicit enthusiasm
from both parents and children. Further, the workshop
brevity, ease of delivery, and low supplies required make
it a realistic public health intervention in an era where
resources are often scarce and increase its likelihood ofTable 3 Workshop strengths and successes from the perspective of workshop facilitators
Workshop strengths and successes
Theme Quotes
Having a parent or teacher
championF1: The 2 schools where we had the most effective recruitment, we had a super-engaged parent that did all the
recruiting for us.
F2: So when people —so for one school that we did [the workshop] in we had a parent advocate in that school
who wanted to bring it in and so that really helped because then the turn out for that [workshop] was much
better …
Children attending
workshopsF4: I think it ’s important to keep- to have at least part of [the workshop] with their kids. Like get [parents] involved
with their own kids right off the bat …. that eliminates big barriers too …then parents don't have to worry about
getting child care or anything like that.
F1: because we got feedback from parents in one of the schools where they weren ’t sure if they could bring their
children ….They felt [not including kids] reduced attendance …..
F2: Umm, so we did allow people to bring their kids, which was good because we had enough facilitators there to
break off into 2 groups …and then we would come back as a big group. So I think that was …helpful and then
we could see how parents are actually interacting with the kids and they can try things right then and there.
F1: So, you need to be able to riff- on the day you need to be able to riff a bit. Oh and here ’s an extension,
because sometimes a family comes and they actually have an 8-year old there and a 5-year old, and the activity for
the 5-year old and the 8-year old are different. And you need to be able to demonstrate those quick revisions on
the fly for the parent.
F3: And I thought that obviously [Facilitator 1] is great at adjusting... [and] in the moment going like “This isn ’t
working, we should do something else ”, so I think that was great. So I think not sticking to the plan too well was
really what made the PLAYshop work when we did it.
F4:…also one of the things I witnessed when I sat in on other [workshops] was the kind of optimism and
enthusiasm and energy from a facilitator. So, that really has an impact on how engaged the parents become
themselves. and how enthusiastic and energetic they are.
Separating parents and
childrenF1: So, reflection and discussion is an important piece of the adult education experience and so that also needs the
kids pulled away
F2: Umm, so we did allow people to bring their kids. Um, which was good because then we had enough kinda
facilitators there to break off into 2 groups. So when we needed to speak to the parents by themselves we could,
and then someone would play games with the kids and then we would come back as a big group.
F3: We did [the workshop]- the ones that I helped out with- we did in 2 elementary school gyms and that's like the
perfect amount of space.
F4:…just really making sure that [the space] is a setting conducive to movement and to physical literacy type
game[s] and play.
Parent response and
engagementF1: So, the parents were really enthusiastic …They asked questions. …. they were very engaged.
F4: The parents seemed to receive [the workshop] well. We did have some parents with their kids there and the
kids [also] seemed to really be engaged and it was a positive atmosphere.
F2: I think the actual content of [the workshop] was good, parents seemed to like that. So I wouldn't change
necessarily that aspect.
F4:…and then those key messages …watching some of the other workshops that were facilitated primarily by
[Facilitator 1] really the emphasis on those key messages about being playful and fun but also [using the play] in
order to develop those skills and the importance behind that.Lane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:113 Page 9 of 12
successful scale-up [ 35]. Despite these strengths, several
implementation barriers were noted, such as distracting
children, difficulty recruiting parents, and unfavorable
delivery spaces. Fortunately, these challenges were ex-
posed in this feasibility study and may now be mitigated
by intervention adaptations. For example, an additional
facilitator to engage children during parental learning
might lessen the distraction —a method successfully
employed for the HDHK father-child practical sessions
[25,26].
This study has numerous limitations including the small
number of participants (largely due to recruitment challenges)
and lack of a control group. However, this is common of
feasibility studies whose primary purpose is to determine
whether future definitive trial so fa ni n t e r v e n t i o ns h o u l dt a k e
place and if so, what this trial should like [ 6]. Another limita-
tion is the possibility of selection bias due to the use of self-
recruitment methods: parents that were engaged with phys-
i c a la c t i v i t ym a yh a v eb e e nm o r el i k e l yt oe n r o l li nt h es t u d y .
Future research is needed to determine how to recruit parents
who are less engaged with physical activity for a more repre-
sentative sample. Lastly, this study is limited by the short time
period between baseline and fo llow-up data collection, with
post-workshop surveys conducted the day following parent
participation in the workshop. Longer term follow-up is
needed to determine if the effects seen immediately following
intervention delivery are main tained. Strengths of the studyincluded the workshop delivery with real-world partners and
in the context in which potential scale-up would occur.
Conclusion
The PLAYshop appeared feasible —it improved parent
knowledge and confidence to promote physical literacy
with their child/children, motivated physical literacy pro-
moting practices, and was highly acceptable to the target
audience, although recruitment was challenging. A more
rigorous assessment of the PLAYshop via a larger trial is
now needed to address the limitations of the current
study and establish its efficacy. The findings from this
study will inform adaptations to improve intervention
implementation and outcomes in such a full-scale effi-
cacy trial. In terms of the intervention impact, follow-up
support for parents was recommended, and in terms of
workshop implementation, an additional leader was en-
couraged. Enhanced recruitment efforts will be needed
in a future trial, in particular more direct parent recruit-
ment by the research team.
This study addresses an important research gap and is
a valuable preliminary step in the development, testing,
and delivery of a scalable parent-focused intervention to
promote childhood physical literacy. It contributes to
the broader physical literacy movement that strives for
children to have “the motivation, confidence, knowledge,Table 4 Workshop challenges and areas for improvement from the perspective of workshop facilitators
Workshop challenges and areas for improvement
Theme Quotes
Workshop recruitment and
attendanceF1: Recruitment. It is so difficult getting the parents [to the workshop]. It is very random. So typically when you're
recruiting in all these settings you ’re going through a third party, like the parent advisory committee person,
inviting the parents through their network or the school principal or the sport club technical director. So, you have
to rely on somebody to send out the notices to the list. So that broke down in some cases, but not all.
F3: I think participation was the biggest one …it’s easy enough to put it out there and say this is gonna happen
and I think in theory like people want to know this sort of stuff …but like when it comes time to actually deliver
the programs a lot of those like “maybes, ya sortas ”turn into no-shows.
Unfavorable spaces F1:…outside space is problematic I would suggest that the workshop should be done indoors and mostly because
we use a lot of balloons and light things and they blow away. The second thing is the ability to bound your
space. It's a bit chaos-y. You need an ability to bound your space
F4:…ya the classroom was a little broken [up] because of all the chairs and the tables and I remember thinking
that it would be better had I pushed like the stuff aside and just created a more open inviting atmosphere.
F3: I think we tried to do it all together and when you ’re- it ’s like 7 o ’clock after school and kids are expecting to
be like playing games and you ’re trying to explain things to the parents while the kids are just standing there and
watching you do it, you lose a lot of that attention because the parents are now worried about what the kids are
doing instead of what you ’re explaining to them about.
F4:….. when the parents that had small children with them, I think it was harder, it was more difficult for them to
(pause) focus and really get the most out of the workshop. ….
Supporting parents after the
workshopF1:…I would do a let ’s make activity and they would leave with the piece of equipment …… We did do a
[simple] handout, …. but a more professional handout and a web resource where they could go to find some
simple ideas probably would help.
F4: [The workshop] is engaging and parents get motivated but then once they leave- what are the chances that
it’s sustained that kind of you know learning and positive energy. …so I think some sort of- follow-up, some sort
of sustainability type strategy just to prompt that continued behaviour.Lane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:113 Page 10 of 12
