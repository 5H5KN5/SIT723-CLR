This study tested the effect of interventions designed for people who do not
eat yet the recommended daily fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) but have a
positive intention to do so. Adults ( N¼163) aged 20–65 were randomised
into four groups: implementation intentions (II group), self-efficacy
(SE group), combination of II þSE group) and a control group receiving
written information on nutrition. Study variables were measured atbaseline, post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up. At follow-up,compared to the control group, FVI increased significantly in the II and
IIþSE groups (1.5 and 1.9 servings per day, respectively). Most psycho-
social variables significantly increased compared to the control group, withthe exception of SE for vegetable intake (VI). Moreover, at 3-monthfollow-up, change in FVI was mediated by changes in fruit intake (FI)
intention and VI action planning. In conclusion, II interventions were
efficient to increase FVI, with or without consideration for the develop-ment of SE. Thus, future studies should favour the adoption of this
approach to bridge the intention–behaviour gap for FVI.

Introduction
Evidence suggests that fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) plays a protective role
against major diseases. Indeed, FVI is associated with reduced risk of cardiovasculardisease and especially cerebrovascular accidents (Dauchet, Amouyel, Hercberg, &Dallongeville, 2006; He, Nowson, & MacGregor, 2006). It is also associated withreduced risk of certain cancers, mainly of the digestive system (Boffetta et al., 2010;World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research, 2007).Finally, a higher FVI is associated with lower body weight and fat mass (Buijsseet al., 2009; Davis, Hodges, & Gillham, 2006; Ledoux, Hingle, & Baranowski, 2010).

However, in spite of the scientific evidence concerning the benefits of FVI, only
11.8% of the French population consumes at least five servings of fruits andvegetables (FV) per day (Escalon, Bossard, & Beck, 2009); respective figures for theUSA (Serdula et al., 2004) and Canada (Garriguet, 2009) are 24.6% and 43.7%.Taking into account these previous statistics, it is justified to develop efficient FVI
promotion programmes.
Few meta-analyses have reported that interventions among samples of the
general adult population that were based on educational group programmes orindividual counselling increase the mean FVI by 0.5 servings per day compared tothe control group (Ammerman, Lindquist, Lohr, & Hersey, 2002; Pignone et al.,2003; Pomerleau, Lock, Knai, & McKee, 2005). The best results have been obtainedamong people at risk of illness, but these effects are not maintained over time. Thesemeta-analyses have also indicated that interventions usually demonstrate positive
effects on FVI although the clinical impact is considered marginal. Moreover,
according to these reviews, most interventions were not theoretically based andconsequently did not allow to precisely identify the behaviour change techniques andthe psychosocial variables mediating behaviour change.
On this regard, a recent systematic review identified that besides habit and
intention, SE was the most consistent factor explaining FVI (Guillaumie, Godin, &Vezina Im, 2010). SE is considered one of the main determinants of behaviouradoption (Bandura, 1997). The concept of SE comes from the social cognitive theory
and is concerned with individuals’ beliefs in their capability to exercise control over
challenging demands and their own functioning. SE has a major role: it determineswhether actions will be initiated, how much effort will be invested and how long itwill be sustained in the face of obstacles and failures. According to this theory and inreference to Abraham and Michie’s (2008) taxonomy, increase in SE can be achievedby means of different behaviour change techniques: to provide instruction, to modelbehaviour, to prompt barrier identification, to prompt practice and to providegeneral encouragement (see the taxonomy for the definitions).
Notwithstanding the role of SE, there is increasing evidence suggesting that
implementation intentions (II) are an effective technique to translate intention intoaction (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). Indeed, intention may not translate into actioneither because the person does not have a clear idea of what to do or is not able toovercome the perceived or real barriers. Again, in reference to the taxonomy ofbehaviour change techniques (Abraham & Michie, 2008), II refer to techniques, suchas prompting barrier identification and specific goal setting. The particularity ofimplementation intentions however resides in the explicit formulation if-then plans
linking an event (or cue) to an action (e.g. ‘If I have a lunch at the cafeteria, then I eat
salad’ and ‘If I don’t have time to cook, then I open a can of vegetables’).
At this time, it remains unclear which behaviour change techniques are most
efficient to provide change in FVI. Concerning IIs, the scientific evidence suggeststhat significant effects were observed after treatment (Armitage, 2007; Chapman,Armitage, & Norman, 2009; de Nooijer, de Vet, Brug, & de Vries, 2006; Kellar &Abraham, 2005) but not at 3-month follow-up (Jackson et al., 2005). Concerningaction and coping plans (a technique similar to II), significant results were obtained
at post-treatment (Wiedemann, Lippke, Reuter, Ziegelmann, & Schwarzer, 2009)
and at 2-month follow-up (an increase of 0.45 portion; Luszczynska & Haynes,2009). With respect to SE, a significant increase in FVI from 0.5 to 1.4 servings perday was observed at post-treatment or 4-month follow-up among interventionsPsychology and Health 31
aimed at simultaneously increasing SE, knowledge and attitude (Anderson, Winett,
Wojcik, Winett, & Bowden, 2001; Campbell et al., 2008; Feldman et al., 2000;Fuemmeler et al., 2006; Langenberg et al., 2000; Marcus et al., 2001; Mosher et al.,2008). The effect of interventions based on SE could be larger (up to 3.4 servings perday at 6-month follow-up) when the number of contacts is high (e.g. 16 meetings;Epstein et al., 2001). FVI computer-based interventions with a focus on SE showedeffect sizes but are smaller to those obtained in individual or group-based
interventions (Kroeze, Werkman, & Brug, 2006; Oenema, Tan, & Brug, 2005).
Finally, it is not known what would be the impact of interventions targetingsimultaneously implementation intentions and SE. Only one previous study hastested the effect of combining action plans with the development of SE on FVI, andno further improvement was observed (Luszczynska, Tryburcy, & Schwarzer, 2007).
The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of interventions aimed at
increasing FVI at 3-month follow-up among motivated adults. Participants wererandomised to one of the four following groups: (1) II; (2) development of SE; (3) IIand development of SE (II þSE) and (4) control. The specific objectives of this study
were: (1) to determine the impact of each approach (II, development of SE) and theircombination on FVI, FI and VI; (2) to identify the moderators of change in FVI, FIand VI and (3) to identify the psychosocial mediators of change in FVI, FI and VI.
Method
Recruitment of participants
Participants were recruited between April and November 2008 by means of
advertisements in local newspapers and health services in cities near Paris, France.During a phone interview conducted by a research assistant (15-minute length), thestudy was described, inclusion criteria were specified and participants were randomlyassigned to one of the study groups. Participants were included if they were agedbetween 20 and 65 and reported eating less than five portions of FV per day. Theywere screened using a validated questionnaire measuring FVI (Godin, Be ´langer-
Gravel, Paradis, Vohl, & Pe ´russe, 2008). Exclusion criteria were living outside the
reach of the intervention centres, unavailability during the intervention period and
being pregnant or currently planning to get pregnant. There was no exclusion formedical reasons. Participants were blinded to the content of other interventions andrandomised using a computer-generated randomisation list to one of the fourgroups. Ethical consent was obtained from the local university and the database wasregistered to the French National Commission on Information Technology andLiberties. All participants gave a written informed consent.
It was calculated that the generalised estimating equations (GEE) analysis, with
an exchangeable correlation of 0.47 and 0.37 participants per group, would allow todetect a significant group /C2time effect between four groups with a statistical power
of 80% and a p¼0.05 (Dahmen, Rochon, Ko ¨nig, & Ziegler, 2004). This was based
on the mean FVI (2.4 /C61.68) in the French population and a one-portion increase at
post-treatment and follow-up (Guilbert & Perrin-Escalon, 2002).
Interventions
Training of dieticians. All group meetings and face-to-face interviews were led by a
trained dietician. A total of 14 dieticians experienced in health education were
randomly assigned to an intervention type, blinded to the content of other32 L. Guillaumie et al.
interventions, and received a 1-day training. Fidelity of programme delivery was
promoted through tape-recording of all sessions, supervision once a week and use ofintervention manuals.
Interventions manuals. They were developed following series of focus groups to
identify barriers associated with FVI, using the Intervention Mapping framework
and were pre-tested (Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, & Gottlieb, 2006). The generalobjective of the interventions was to promote eating at least two servings of fruitsand three servings of vegetables per day. The content of the experimental
interventions was divided into five performance objectives (POs) addressed in four
successive weekly meetings: (1) to take the decision to eat at least two servings offruits and three servings of vegetables per day; (2) to buy enough FV to eat at leasttwo servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day; (3) to prepare or cookat least three servings of vegetable per day and (4) to eat at least two servings of fruitsper day, and to eat at least five servings of FV during the next 12 months despite
obstacles (Table A1). The content of the first meeting was common to the three
experimental groups. It was concerned with knowledge, outcome expectations andintention regarding FVI. For that purpose, the behaviour change techniques usedwere ‘providing information about behaviour–health link’, ‘providing informationon consequences’, ‘prompting self-monitoring of behaviour’ and ‘prompting
intention formation’. In the subsequent meetings, each experimental group was
exposed to specific techniques.
For participants in the II group. A total of four face-to-face interviews of 20–
30 minutes each were offered. At each meeting (with the exception of the first
meeting), the ‘prompting barrier identification’ and ‘prompting specific goal setting’
techniques were used. Participants were required to identify the barriers to achieve
the POs and then to plan, in detail, how the behaviour or preparatory behaviourswould be performed and how the barriers to behaviour performance would beovercome. They formulated and wrote down between two and five II plans inresponse to each PO. The plans were of two types: ‘To do x, I will do y (where, when
and how)’; and ‘If the situation x arises, then I do y’ (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).
No control was implemented to verify if participants took these plans awaywith them.
For the participants in the SE group. A total of four group meetings of 2 h each were
offered with a maximum of 12 participants per group. At each meeting (with the
exception of the first meeting), the following techniques were used to increase SE: to
prompt barrier identification, to prompt practice, to provide instruction and toprovide general encouragement. As this was done in a group setting, it inevitablyinvolved another technique ‘to provide opportunities for social comparison’.Participants were required to identify the barriers to achieve the POs, to develop
strategies to overcome the barriers and to practice the implementation of these
strategies by means of role-playing. Dieticians provided instruction on how toperform the behaviour and used encouragements.Psychology and Health 33
For the participants of the II þSE group. Four two-hour group meetings were
offered. The techniques used in the II and the SE groups were combined. First, thebehavioural change techniques pertaining to the development of SE were used. Then,participants were required to individually formulate II plans.
For the control group. They received brochures on healthy eating including factual
information on FVI: four weekly mailings were sent with a personalised letter. Thecontent of the mailed documents was written without reference to psychosocialtheories.
Measures
Variables were measured by means of questionnaires administered to participants at
the beginning of the study, at the end of the 1-month intervention, as well as 3months after the end of the intervention. FVI, FI and VI were measured using a self-
reported, reliable and validated questionnaire for obese and non-obese populations;
the Pearson correlation coefficient with the FFQ for the mean daily intake wasr¼0.65, p50.0001 (Godin et al., 2008). This questionnaire contained 6 items,
measuring FVI during a period of 7 days and was expressed as a daily average.Demographic variables included gender, age, height and weight (body mass index),marital status, maternal country of birth, education level and income.
Psychosocial variables were measured separately for two behaviours: ‘to eat at
least two portions of fruit during the next 30 days’ and ‘to eat at least three portions
of vegetables during the next 30 days’. Variables measured were intention (3 items),
SE (between 5 and 6 items), action planning (6 items) and coping planning (4 items;Schwarzer, 2008; Sniehotta, Schwarzer, Scholz, & Schu ¨tz, 2005). Habit of eating FV
was measured at baseline only (8 items; de Bruijn et al., 2007). For most items, a5-point Likert-type scale was used (from Certainly No toCertainly Yes ).
Psychometric qualities were adequate. All alpha coefficients were above 0.75 andscores for temporal stability (intraclass coefficients) ranged from 0.58 to 0.83, withthe exception for FI coping planning (0.47).
Data analysis
Descriptive analyses were first performed to verify the equivalence of the groups on
sociodemographic, psychosocial and behavioural variables. Then, the GEEapproach with three measurement times (pre-intervention, post-intervention and
3-month follow-up) was adopted to test the impact of the intervention on each of the
three dependent variables: FVI, FI and VI. The GEE are considered as an extensionof the GLM for longitudinal repeated data providing more efficient and unbiasedregression estimates (Liang & Zeger, 1986). In the GEE, the behavioural measurewas entered as the dependent variable and group, time and group /C2time as the
independent variables. Contrast analyses compared the mean increases in FVI, FIand VI between groups. The same approach was used to study the impact of theinterventions on psychosocial variables. These analyses were ‘complete case
analyses’, i.e. included only the participants providing complete data at the three
measurement times. Finally, an intention-to-treat analysis (baseline observationcarried forward) was also performed on the FVI as the main outcome variable.34 L. Guillaumie et al.
As recommended by Aiken and West (1991), a three-step analysis was conducted
to test moderating effects of the intervention. Gender, age and income associated inprevious studies with FVI (Kennedy et al., 2005; Tohill, Seymour, Serdula, Kettel-Khan, & Rolls, 2004) and the psychosocial variables at baseline were examined asmoderators. The moderating effect was detected if the interaction term was
statistically significant and if the explained variance ( R
2) significantly increased
(p50.05). If a moderating effect was detected, simple slopes by levels of moderators
were generated (at mean /C01 SD, mean and mean þ1 SD).
Finally, mediators of the effect of the intervention were verified. The investigated
mediators included intention, SE, action planning and coping planning, respectively,for FI and VI. We used the SAS bootstrap procedure (1000 re-samples) for multiplemediation proposed by Preacher and Hayes (2009) to estimate mediation effect withthe 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals (CI). In the mediating andmoderating analyses, as group was a four-level categorical variable, it was dummycoded taking the control group as reference for comparisons. Moreover, the term‘change’ on the behavioural or psychosocial variables was used to refer to thevariables adjusted for the baseline level and not to a change score per se . Statistical
software used for all analyses was SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Descriptive statistics
A total of 319 participants were randomised and 28 were excluded (flowchart in
Table A2). Among the 291 participants remaining, 218 completed their programme;
that is, they attended at least three of four meetings for the experimental groups or
received weekly mails in the control group, 192 completed the post-treatmentquestionnaire and 163 completed both the post-treatment and 3-month follow-upquestionnaires. In the final sample analysed ( N¼163), there were 36, 47, 52 and 28
participants in the II, SE, II þSE and control groups, respectively. Study dropouts
were de-briefed, with most reporting lack of time to take part in the study, and lackof interest as a reason for not completing the intervention.
The randomisation check on the study variables indicated a significant difference
only for gender ( /C31
2¼17.4; p50.001) although gender was not correlated to baseline
FVI ( r’s¼0.08, p¼0.28). Individuals who participated only at baseline were
compared to those who completed both the post-treatment and follow-up question-naires. No between group differences were found with the exception for gender andmaternal country of birth. Those who did not complete all questionnaires were moreoften male ( /C31
2¼4.5; p50.05) and, more often, had a mother born abroad
(/C312¼11.78; p50.001). Notwithstanding these differences, it is important to note
that there was no group difference on these variables at follow-up that is among the
final sample analysed ( N¼163).
Participants at baseline ( N¼291) were aged between 20 and 65 ( M¼40.8,
SD¼10.6), 85% were women and 22% were obese (i.e. body mass index /C2130). Most
of the respondents were living as a couple (64%), had completed college education(53%), and one third had a mother born abroad (36%) and earned less than thenational median monthly income (33%). Participants reported consuming anaverage of 3.4 /C61.54 servings of FV per day, that is 1.85 servings of vegetables
(SD¼1.01) and 1.55 servings of fruits (SD ¼0.94). Also, the participants reported aPsychology and Health 35
high intention to eat at least three servings of vegetables per day (3.9 on a 5-point
scale) and a very high intention to eat at least two servings per day of fruits (4.3 on a5-point scale).
Effects of the intervention on FVI, FI and VI
The GEE analysis of FVI revealed a significant group /C2time effect ( N¼163,/C31
2¼15,
p¼0.02). Contrast analyses showed that at 3-month follow-up, compared to the
control group, FVI increased significantly in the II and II þSE groups (1.5 and 1.9
servings per day, respectively). Regarding the effect of the intervention on FI, theGEE indicated a significant time effect ( p50.001), but a non-significant group -
time effect ( /C31
2¼7.6,p¼0.26). On VI, a significant group /C2time effect ( /C312¼21.0,
p50.01) was observed. Contrast analyses showed that compared to the control
group, the VI increased significantly in the II þSE group compared to the control
and SE groups; it was near significance ( p50.06) in the II group (Table 1). It is
remarkable that the GEE analysis of FVI, when carried out by intention to treat,also shown a significant group /C2time effect ( N¼291,/C31
2¼17,p50.01). The contrast
analyses also showed that at 3-month follow-up, compared to the control group, FVI
increased significantly in the II and II þSE groups ( p¼0.02 and p50.01,
respectively).
Effects of the intervention on psychosocial variables
Concerning FI, there were significant group /C2time effects on intention ( N¼163,
/C312¼14.9, p¼0.03), SE ( /C312¼12.9, p¼0.05) and coping planning ( /C312¼16.8,
p¼0.001); action planning was near significance ( /C312¼11.5, p¼0.07). Concerning
VI, significant group /C2time effects were observed for intention ( /C312¼21.0, p¼0.001)
and SE ( /C312¼14.3, p¼0.03). Despite significant time effects ( p50.001), no
significant group /C2time effects were observed for action planning ( /C312¼8.3,
p¼0.22) and coping planning ( /C312¼9.15, p¼0.17). Means and contrast analyses
of the psychosocial variables are reported in Table 2. At 3-month follow-up,
compared to the control group, the II and II þSE groups increased in intention,
respectively for FI and VI (nearly significant in the II þSE group for VI; p50.06).
For the same period, SE for FI was significantly increased in the three experimentalgroups, whereas no changes were observed in SE for VI. Finally, compared to thecontrol group, the three experimental groups significantly increased action planningand coping planning (with the exception for VI action planning in the II þSE
group).
Moderators of the effects of the intervention
With FVI at post-intervention as the dependent variable, two significant interactions
were found between group and the baseline level of FI coping planning and betweengroup and the baseline level of VI action planning. They explained, respectively, anadditional 3% and 5% of the variance. The significant interaction terms were II /C2FI
coping planning ( p¼0.01) and II þSE/C2VI action planning ( p¼0.01; group
variable was dummy coded; details in Table A3). Participants in the II group with alow level of FI coping planning at baseline showed greater improvement in FVI36 L. Guillaumie et al.

compared to those with a high level of FI coping planning. Also, participants in the
IIþSE group with a low level of VI action planning at baseline showed greater
improvement in FVI compared to those with a high level of action planning. The
contrary was observed in the control group: the lower the level of planning atbaseline, the lower the increase in FVI (Figure 1). The R
2changes associated with the
interactions were not statistically significant at 3-month follow-up.
Mediators of behaviour change
Multiple mediation analysis examined whether changes in behaviour were explained
by changes in psychosocial variables (intention, SE, action planning and copingplanning, respectively, for FI and VI; Table A4). At post-treatment, change in FVI
was fully mediated by changes in FI intention, coping planning and VI intention
(Figure 2 for indirect effects and 95% CI). Group predicted changes in FVI (c path),FI intention, coping planning and VI intention (a path), and changes in these latter
variables predicted changes in FVI (b path). At follow-up, change in FVI was
mediated by changes in FI intention and VI action planning (Figure 2 for indirecteffects and 95% CI; full mediation in the II þSE and SE groups). Group predicted
changes in FVI (c path; significant for the II þSE and SE groups), FI intention and
VI action planning (a path), and changes on these latter variables predicted changesin FVI (b path).
Discussion
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of theory-based interventions
designed for people who have a positive intention to increase their FVI, but have not
yet reached that goal. First, all groups improved their FVI, including the controlgroup. Nonetheless, at 3-month follow-up, compared to the control group, FVI
increased significantly in the II and II þSE groups (1.5 and 1.9 servings per day,
respectively). This impact was obtained with or without consideration for thedevelopment of SE, although a slightly larger increase in FVI was observed in the
IIþSE group. On the contrary, the SE group did not significantly differ from the
control group, even if it responded to the intervention at a level similar to the mostefficient published studies based on the same approach and a similar number of
meetings (1.3 servings per day; (e.g. Feldman et al., 2000; Fuemmeler et al., 2006).
This means that interventions based on implementation intentions demonstratedsuperiority compared to interventions based on the development of SE.
This study assessed the effect of II plans in face-to-face and group interventions
on eating habits. Previous interventions that implemented either II plans or action/coping plans about FVI used planning sheets. As a result, these interventions
reported an increase in FVI either at the end of treatment or at 2-month follow-up
only (Luszczynska & Haynes, 2009); this latter study reported an increase of 0.45portions in FVI. In this study, II plans were implemented differently: several plans
were formulated for all preparatory behaviours, plans were preceded by an
identification of salient barriers and this process was facilitated by a dietician. Inthis context, II plans were efficient to increase FVI in a clinically meaningful manner
at 3-month follow-up. The positive effect of the intervention among the II and
IIþSE groups is comparable to previously published interventions delivered byPsychology and Health 39

means of individual or group meetings using various behavioural change techniques
at a similar intensity (an average of four meetings; e.g. Fuemmeler et al., 2006;Resnicow et al., 2001; Steptoe et al., 2003). In fact, only interventions providing morethan eight meetings have reported better effects than the values in our II and II þSE
groups (Epstein et al., 2001; Newman, Flatt, & Pierce, 2008). Consequently, thisstudy provides strong support for the efficacy of implementation intentions topromote FVI among an adult population.
Concerning the impact of interventions on the targeted determinants, it was
shown that participants in the SE group did not significantly increase their VI SE at3-month follow-up, while VI action planning and coping planning were enhanced. Infact, the development of SE for VI was not successfully achieved in this study. Thehigher increase in VI SE was observed in the SE group (0.4 on a 5-point scale) andthis increase appeared higher than the values reported in previous studies (Campbellet al., 2008; Fuemmeler et al., 2006; Mosher et al., 2008). Considering that SE isreported as one of the main determinants of FVI, there is an urgent need to
investigate which behaviour change techniques and parameters should be used to
allow a sustainable increase in FVI SE. In addition, the levels of action planning andcoping planning were increased not only by the interventions based on implemen-tation intentions, but also by the interventions based on the development of SE.D FI Coping planning

In fact, although each of these approaches was based on specific theoretical
assumptions, both shared the development and implementation of strategies toadopt the behaviour and to overcome barriers to action.
The effects of the intervention on FVI at follow-up were mediated by changes in FI
intention and VI action planning. In the II and II þSE groups, a small-to-medium
change in FI intention ( d¼0.45 [95% CI 0.02–0.9] and d¼0.33 [95% CI 0.06–0.7],
respectively) and a large change in VI action planning ( d¼1.1 [95% CI 0.69–1.56] and
d¼0.9 [95% CI 0.5–1.32], respectively) were responsible for the change in FVI ( d¼0.9
[95% CI 0.5–1.3] in both groups). The mediating role of intention is in line with mostpsychosocial theories and a large corpus of studies. It was previously shown that amedium-to-large change in intention ( d¼0.66 [95% CI 0.51–0.82]) would lead to a
small-to-medium change in behaviour ( d¼0.36 [95% CI 0.22–0.55]; Webb & Sheeran,
2006). The mediating role of action planning observed in this study adds to an
emergent but rapidly growing scientific literature. In previous studies, either
interventions engendered no change in action planning (Araujo-Soares, McIntyre,& Sniehotta, 2009; Scholz, Ziegelmann, Lippke, & Schwarzer, 2008), or changes inaction planning mediated behaviour change (Luszczynska et al., 2007; Wiedemannet al., 2009). Moreover, it was shown that implementation intentions had a medium-to-large effect on goal attainment ( d¼0.65 [95% CI 0.60–0.70]; Gollwitzer & Sheeran,
2006). Therefore, these findings on the mediating role of action planning confirm theimportance of implementation intentions in bridging the gap between intention and
behaviour (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).
It was also shown by the mediation analyses that different variables mediated the
effects of intervention on FVI. FI and VI intentions were both involved as mediatingvariables. However, it was coping planning pertaining to FI and action planning forVI that mediated the effect of the intervention. Two explanations can be offered toexplain this difference. First, at the onset of the intervention, participants werealmost eating two portions of fruit per day, as recommended ( M¼1.55, SD ¼0.94),
but were still at some distance from eating the recommended three portions of
vegetables per day ( M¼1.85, SD ¼1.01). Thus, the target for FI was more
attainable than for VI. Second, FI is considered an easier behaviour to adopt,contrary to VI. Indeed, VI is more time consuming, requires more cooking skills andpreparatory behaviours, and vegetables are usually consumed in complex contexts(e.g. a family dinner; Aarts, Paulussen, & Schaalma, 1997; Armitage, 2007).Considering the paucity of studies on this issue, it can only be suggested that copingplanning may especially mediate behaviour change for easy-to-adopt behaviourswhile action planning for more complex behaviours.
The responses of the participants in the control group also require attention.
Indeed, whereas participants demonstrated no change on psychosocial variables,they increased their daily FVI of 0.8 portions at follow-up. This result is similar towhat was obtained in previous interventions that used printed material (Resnicowet al., 2009). Given that the studied population was motivated at the onset of thestudy, this effect may be due to the fact that they were provided with information onhealthy diet and were requested to complete psychosocial and behaviouralquestionnaires three times. To provide general information as well as to prompt
self-monitoring in completing a questionnaire are identified as behaviour change
techniques (Abraham & Michie, 2008). To fill a questionnaire on cognitions towardsa behaviour is known to have mere measurement effects (Godin, Sheeran, Conner, &Germain, 2008).42 L. Guillaumie et al.
Finally, the effect of the intervention on behaviour was moderated by FI coping
planning and VI action planning. Indeed, the lower was the baseline level on thesevariables the higher was the impact of the intervention. This indicates that
implementation intentions may be more beneficial for people in need for interven-
tion. To our knowledge, this is the first intervention study to demonstrate themoderating role of these variables.
Limitations
One of the limitations of this study is the small sample size. The concern is that
analyses can be heavily influenced by one or two extreme cases. In our study, similar
results were obtained when GEE, moderation and mediation analyses were carried outwith and without extreme cases. Another limitation is the attrition rate even thoughthere were no between-group differences among participants who returned all
questionnaires or not. This could be the result of the lack of felt involvement with the
study resulting from the type of contacts (e.g. no face-to-face contacts) with dieticiansoffering the intervention. However, this potential bias did not negatively influence the
effects of the intervention on FVI as showed by the intention-to-treat analysis.
Conclusions
Implementation interventions as implemented in this study demonstrated efficacy to
increase FVI in a clinically significant manner at 3-month follow-up in a contextwhere low-income as well as ethnically diverse participants were recruited.Practitioners should therefore consider developing FVI interventions based on this
approach among a motivated population. In addition, this study underlined the
knowledge gap on the behaviour change techniques allowing reaching a significantand sustainable increase in VI SE. As SE is recognised as a main determinant of FVI,
there is an urgent need for additional investigations on this topic. Finally, changes in
coping planning and action planning mediated behaviour change. Therefore, thisstudy provides an additional support for adding action planning and copingplanning to psychosocial theories such as social cognitive theory or theory of
planned behaviour (Schwarzer, 2008). However, relationships between these
variables and the variables from these theories should be clarified.
