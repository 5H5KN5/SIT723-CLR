Abstract
Background: Normalization Process Theory (NPT) identifies, characterises and explains key mechanisms that
promote and inhibit the implementation, embedding and integration of new health techniques, technologies and
other complex interventions. A large body of literature that employs NPT to inform feasibility studies and process
evaluations of complex healthcare interventions has now emerged. The aims of this review were to review this
literature; to identify and characterise the uses and limits of NPT in research on the implementation and integration
of healthcare interventions; and to explore NPT ’s contribution to understanding the dynamics of these processes.
Methods: A qualitative systematic review was conducted. We searched Web of Science, Scopus and Google
Scholar for articles with empirical data in peer-reviewed journals that cited either key papers presenting and
developing NPT, or the NPT Online Toolkit ( www.normalizationprocess.org ). We included in the review only articles
that used NPT as the primary approach to collection, analysis or reporting of data in studies of the implementation
of healthcare techniques, technologies or other interventions. A structured data extraction instrument was used,
and data were analysed qualitatively.
Results: Searches revealed 3322 citations. We show that after eliminating 2337 duplicates and broken or junk URLs,
985 were screened as titles and abstracts. Of these, 101 were excluded because they did not fit the inclusion criteria
for the review. This left 884 articles for full-text screening. Of these, 754 did not fit the inclusion criteria for the
review. This left 130 papers presenting results from 108 identifiable studies to be included in the review. NPT
appears to provide researchers and practitioners with a conceptual vocabulary for rigorous studies of
implementation processes. It identifies, characterises and explains empirically identifiable mechanisms that motivate
and shape implementation processes. Taken together, these mean that analyses using NPT can effectively assist in
the explanation of the success or failure of specific implementation projects. Ten percent of papers included
critiques of some aspect of NPT, with those that did mainly focusing on its terminology. However, two studies
critiqued NPT emphasis on agency, and one study critiqued NPT for its normative focus.
Conclusions: This review demonstrates that researchers found NPT useful and applied it across a wide range of
interventions. It has been effectively used to aid intervention development and implementation planning as well as
evaluating and understanding implementation processes themselves. In particular, NPT appears to have offered a
valuable set of conceptual tools to aid understanding of implementation as a dynamic process.

Background
Implementation theories are useful. They provide expla-
nations for relevant phenomena, propose important re-
search questions and frame the collection and analysis
of data [ 1]. These explanations are generalizable and
facilitate comparative studies. Implementation re-
searchers now have a wide range of useful theoretical
tools at their disposal [ 2–4]. Normalization Process
Theory (NPT) [ 5–10] is one of these. It identifies,
characterises and explains mechanisms that have been
empirically demonstrated to motivate and shape
implementation processes and affect their outcomes.
This paper presents a systematic review of studies of
healthcare interventions informed by NPT.
What is NPT and what does it do?
NPT is a theory of implementation that focuses on what
people —both individuals and groups —do rather than
what they believe or intend, and it has been built up
from studies of practice in many different healthcare sys-
tems. This means that it focuses attention on aspects of
individual and collective behaviour shown to be import-
ant in empirical studies of implementation processes.
The development of NPT first involved the iterative de-
velopment of a robust generic theory of implementation
[5–9,11,12]. From this, tools were developed to assist
implementation practitioners and researchers [ 13–16]i n
thinking through and measuring important elements of
implementation processes. In its most recent iteration,
we have shown how the basic mechanisms characterised
in NPT function as self-organising mechanisms in com-
plex adaptive social systems [ 10]. Theory development
in NPT has been iterative, with three phases of develop-
ment around practical questions.
1. Objects: How are components of complex
interventions operationalised by their users? In the
first iteration of the theory —the Normalization
Process Model (NPM) [ 5,6]—we identified the
importance of collective action in routinely
incorporating complex interventions into everyday
practice. We showed how collective action was
organised around interactions between users and
the properties of intervention components.
2. Agents: What is the work of implementing a new
technique, technology or organisational
intervention? In the second iteration of the
theory —Normalization Process Theory (NPT)
[7,8]—we characterised mechanisms (coherence,
cognitive participation, collective action and
reflexive monitoring) that motivate and shape
implementation processes and explained their
operation.3. Contexts: How are structural and cognitive
resources for implementation mobilised and what
mechanisms lead to variations in implementation
processes over time and between settings? In the
most recent iteration of the theory —Extended
Normalization Process Theory (ENPT) [ 9,10]—we
pointed to the dynamic role of implementation
contexts in the mobilisation and negotiation of
implementation processes.
Underpinning these practical questions is one that is
fundamental to the social and behavioural sciences —and
especially to behavioural economics, sociology and social
psychology —which is how can we best understand the
dynamics of human agency under conditions of con-
straint [10]? The important implication of this question
is that well-designed, theoretically informed studies in
implementation research actually offer opportunities for
basic investigations in the social sciences.
The purpose of this review
A review by McEvoy et al. [ 17], published in 2014, pro-
vided a qualitative synthesis of 29 early and heteroge-
neous studies in which NPT was used. It drew attention
to a positive response from healthcare researchers to the
theory, but it also made three important critical points
about the emerging NPT literature. McEvoy et al. [ 17]
pointed to the ways that early studies using NPT did lit-
tle work to justify the choice of theory, called for the
prospective application of NPT to data analysis and col-
lection and stressed the importance of moving beyond
single stakeholder perspectives.
In the period since McEvoy et al. ’s review [ 17], studies
using NPT have proliferated. There are now a large
number of protocols, empirical studies and reviews in
which NPT plays a role. Importantly, a large number of
NPT studies have now been completed by groups who
are independent of the theory ’s architects. It is therefore
an opportune time to undertake a qualitative systematic
review that will (i) identify and characterise the uses and
limits of NPT in research on the implementation and in-
tegration of healthcare interventions and (ii) explore
NPT’s contribution to understanding the dynamics of
these processes.
Methods
Systematic citation searches
As the aim of this qualitative systematic review was to
identify the uses of NPT in research on the implementa-
tion and integration of health care interventions since
the publication of the first iteration of the theory in
2006, our search strategy was focused on citations. Fol-
lowing Kirk et al. ’s review of reports of the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research [ 18], weMay et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:80 Page 2 of 27
searched two bibliographic two databases (Scopus and
Web of Science), and a search engine (Google Scholar),
to search for citations of key papers that developed or
expounded the main constructs of NPT [ 5–9,11,12],
papers that developed NPT related methods or tools
[13–15] and citations of the NPT web-enabled on-line
toolkit ( www.normalizationprocess.org )[16]. Searches
were conducted by AC, MG, CRM, MM and TLF. The
sensitivity of the search strategy was tested against a
database of studies using NPT that had been collected
by three of the co-authors (CRM, TR, TF). All studies
already known to use NPT at December 2015 were iden-
tified by the first round of systematic searches. Searches
were initially undertaken in June 2015 and were updated
in December 2015, August 2016 and March 2017. A
final search was undertaken in December 2017.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included the following: peer-reviewed English lan-
guage journal articles reporting empirical research on
the implementation of healthcare interventions, in which
NPT was the primary analytic framework (applied either
prospectively in study design and data collection, or
retrospectively in the interpretation of already collected
data) and which were undertaken in any healthcare set-
ting. We define an empirical paper as one that contains
evidence of data collection and analysis. We included
studies that used any method of empirical investigation
(qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods).
We excluded the following: papers in which NPT was
used as a framework for systematic reviews or
meta-syntheses; papers solely on patient and caregiver
experiences; papers in which NPT was not the primary
analytic theory; editorials, theory and methods discus-
sion papers; papers containing passing references to
NPT; study protocols; papers describing work under-
taken in settings other than healthcare; and papers pub-
lished in languages other than English. We also excluded
theses or dissertations, books and book chapters, confer-
ence proceedings and abstracts. We did not exclude pa-
pers on the grounds of methodological quality. We
already knew that the literature ranged from student
projects through to process evaluations in large and
well-designed clinical trials in which NPT informed all
activities from design through process evaluation and
follow-up, to interpretation of trial outcomes. All studies
were equally interesting to us, because we were search-
ing for information about the way in which the theory
was used rather than the summative results of NPT
analyses.
Screening
Screening started with an assessment of citations and
abstracts ’relevance by reviewers who had not beeninvolved in the development of NPT (AC and MM).
Reports that met eligibility criteria were obtained in full
text. Full-text papers were screened by pairs of reviewers
(AC with MM or CRM; MB with CRM; or CRM and
TF) working independently of each other. Full-text
screening consisted of identifying papers where NPT
was clearly the analytic framework for an empirical
study. Because no ‘one best way ’to operationalise NPT
and its constructs has been prescribed, we did not apply
judgments about this to screened papers. This meant
that screening involved a simple Yes/No question, and
references were sorted within Endnote Libraries
accordingly.
Data extraction
We developed an extraction instrument, (see
Additional file 1: Appendix 1). Data were extracted by
all authors except CMM, FSM and EM. To avoid con-
flicts of interest, authors or co-authors of included pa-
pers were not involved in extracting data from those
papers. Data were extracted on authors, year of publica-
tion, health care problem addressed, study type and
methods, data collection procedures, how NPT was used
in the study and whether this had been pre-specified in
the study protocol. We looked for data on whether and
how NPT had contributed to understanding the dynamics
of the processes of implementation and integration, and
for authors ’views about the limitations of NPT in terms
of both its scope (what the theory explains) and applica-
tion (what happens when researchers use the theory). As
this was a qualitative review, we included data from both
the results and discussion sections of included papers.
Data analysis
Coding and initial interpretation work was undertaken
using the extraction instrument. To ensure consistency,
CRM and TLF jointly checked coding on 75/130 of in-
cluded papers, and CRM and CMM jointly checked cat-
egorisation of all included papers. The analysis aimed (i)
to identify and characterise the uses and limitations of
NPT in research on the implementation and integration
of healthcare interventions and (ii) to explore NPT ’s
contribution to understanding the dynamics of these
processes. Hence, we started by describing how NPT
had been used and subsequently analysed the data to ex-
plore the ways that mechanisms defined by NPT have
been revealed to operate. We sought to understand the
relative importance of specific NPT constructs across
different settings (core processes and mechanisms) and
differences that seemed to apply in relation to different
intervention types and healthcare systems (contingent
processes and mechanisms).May et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:80 Page 3 of 27
Public registration of the review
PROSPERO deemed this review ineligible for public
registration on the grounds that NPT was not a health-
care intervention.
Results
Search results
Searches revealed 3322 citations. In Fig. 1, we show that
after eliminating 2337 duplicates and broken or junk
URLs, 985 were screened as titles and abstracts. Of
these, 101 were excluded because they did not fit the in-
clusion criteria for the review. This left 884 articles for
full-text screening. Of these, 754 did not fit the inclusion
criteria for the review. This left 130 papers presenting
results from 108 identifiable studies to be included in
the review.
Types of studies
In this review, 130 papers reported the application of
NPT in 108 identifiable studies. Included articles
presented both controlled ( n= 26) and uncontrolled
(n= 82) studies.
In Table 1, we show that NPT was employed in 26
controlled studies —mainly complex intervention trials —
and these generated 40/130 (30.8%) articles [ 19–58].
These included an intervention design study ( n= 1),
feasibility studies ( n= 5), process evaluations ( n= 19)
and retrospective documentary analyses ( n= 1), embed-
ded in complex intervention trials. Three of thesestudies used mixed methods, and one [ 55] was a survey.
The remainder ( n= 22) all used qualitative methods.
In Table 2, we show that NPT was employed in in 82
uncontrolled studies, and these generated 90/130
(69.2%) articles [ 59–148]. These included feasibility
studies ( n= 20) and process evaluations ( n= 54), and
seven were what we have called ‘field studies ’which fo-
cused on general conditions in which interventions
might take place, rather than the progress of specific in-
terventions. One study was an ethnography of a set of
socio-technical practices [ 103]. Qualitative methods
were used in 72 studies. Of the remainder, seven were
mixed methods studies, two were surveys, and one was a
prospective cohort study.
What was being implemented?
Studies included in this review fell into seven categories.
The most numerous group of studies were those con-
cerned with service organisation and delivery (n= 29,
26.9% [ 23,27,32–35,43–46,58,76,79,82,84,86,89,
91,92,99,105–107,110,115,116,119,122,127,133–
136,140,146,148]). For example, in the UK, Grant et al.
[34,35] evaluated a complex intervention aimed at redu-
cing risk in prescribing in primary care. They used NPT
in‘identifying and describing the components and
sub-components of the intervention ’to understand ‘the
nuances associated with collective implementation ’.T h e
next most numerous group of studies focused on the
implementation of diagnostic and therapeutic

interventions (n= 28, 25.9% [ 19,24–26,28–31,36,37,
47,48,55–57,67,69,78,80,90,95,97,98,103,104,
111,117,123,126,137,142,143]). For example, in the
USA, Hoberg et al. [ 98] examined the implementation of
a new form of group therapy for people with mental
health problems, while Leon et al. [ 48] showed how pro-
vider initiated testing and counselling for HIV was suc-
cessfully normalised in a South African setting. Studies
of implementation of E-Health and telemedicine —in-
cluding telephone advice —were also numerous ( n= 21,
19.4% [ 21,22,49,59–62,66,71,73–75,83,85,87,88,
93,112,114,118,125,128,130,145]). Here, a
Norwegian team led by Wilhelmsen et al. [ 145] showed
how problems of participation and action —and espe-
cially the interactional workability —of a service provid-
ing internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy led to
ambivalence on the part of general practitioners about its
use, to low levels of follow-up and to doctors reverting to
‘standard treatment ’[145]. Less numerous ( n= 11, 10.1%,
were studies of the implementation of screening and
surveillance tools [38–42,53,64,65,72,77,113,129,132,
139,144]). In a feasibility study, Ahmed et al. [ 64]s h o w e d
that integrating a family history questionnaire about com-
mon genetic diseases into the workflow of primary care
was unlikely without significant changes to the pattern of
GP-patient interactions, and these were unlikely to be
supported by clinicians. Such professional factors also af-
fected the outcome of studies of decision support and
shared decisionmaking (n=8 , 7 . 4 % [ 81,96,100,108,109,
120,121,124,131,147]). In this category, in the USA,
Scalia et al. [ 124] compared the implementation and inte-
gration of decision support tools between two major
healthcare systems. This study raised important questions
about how the interactions between clinicians ’(micro-le-
vel) experiences of the workability of complex interven-
tions and meso-level organisational processes through
which reflexive monitoring mechanisms play out their
effects. Some studies were also explicitly concerned with
implementing change in professional roles (n=7 ,6 . 5 %[ 20,
54,63,70,94,101,138]). For example, Thomas et al. [ 56,
57] showed how changes in roles and workload interacted
to promote the routine embedding of an intervention
intended to manage incontinence in stroke patients.
Finally, a small group of studies were concerned with
guideline implementation (n=4 , 3 . 7 % [ 50–52,68,102,
141]). Here, Vest et al. [ 141] described a study in the USA
of the implementation of guidelines for the management
of chronic kidney disease in primary care. They asserted
that NPT could not only identify key barriers to practice
but could also guide intervention choice.
Was what was being implemented evidence-based?
Studies included in this review were mainly focused on
reporting the implementation of complex healthcareinterventions. Most of these studies had a translational
component and made some claim about the evidence
underpinning interventions. This evidence was heteroge-
neous and included qualitative studies [ 120,121], imple-
mentation appraisals [ 133], meta-ethnographies [ 137]a n d
previous trial results [ 38–41]. However, the most common
appeal to an evidence base in studies included in this re-
view was through references to systematic reviews and
rigorously developed clinical guidelines. Across the studies
included in the review, 64/108 (59.2%) were linked to such
support by their authors [ 149–201]. As Tables 1and 2
show, systematic reviews and rigorous guidelines were
cited in support of 17/26 (65.4%) controlled studies and
47/82 (57.3%) uncontrolled studies.
How did researchers justify the use of NPT?
As Tables 1and2show, in 54/108 (50%) of the studies in-
cluded in this review, the use of NPT appeared to have
been planned in advance, and this was included in the
study protocol. Amongst controlled studies, 19/26 (73%)
of studies made explicit reference to including NPT in
study protocols, while only 35/82 (42.7%) of uncontrolled
studies did so. Not all papers offered a justification for
using NPT. For the most part, authors characterised NPT
as a conceptual framework that explains implementation
processes and thus structures study design and data ana-
lysis. For example, Brooks et al. [ 23] justify it thus:
‘Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) has been used
to consider complex interventions prior to the
development of a randomised control trial to test
their effectiveness ( …). It has also been used in the
context of mental health to explore the impact of new
forms of collaborative care on the way in which
professionals carry out their routines of work in
primary care ( …). The four constructs (coherence,
cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive
monitoring) permit a means of appraising factors that
might ‘promote and inhibit the routine incorporation
of complex interventions into everyday life ’(…). It
focuses on the work that people need to do to ensure
interventions become ‘normalised ’. As a heuristic
framework it can support the optimisation of a trial
intervention at three points:
/C15supporting intervention design
/C15describing the context of a trial
/C15supporting the interpretation of a trial ’s results ’[23].
Other papers reflected in more general terms on
NPT’s empirical grounding (e.g. [ 28,50,52,67,73–75,May et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:80 Page 13 of 27
87,114,122]) and its usefulness in thinking about imple-
mentation design (e.g. [ 27,33,67,106,147,202,203]).
Did NPT explain implementation outcomes?
In all but one study in the review [ 84], there was evi-
dence that implementation outcomes could be explained
by reference to the mechanisms specified by NPT. For
example, Scalia et al. [ 124], state that their study
suggests that patient decision aids that are specifically
designed for use in clinical encounters can be
embedded in clinical settings, provided there is
agreement about the need to use them, that the team
members are willing to work together to make sure
that such tools can be integrated in existing work
patterns, and understood as making a positive overall
contribution to the work that has to be performed.
These considerations match the mechanisms of the
NPT, which provides an explanatory framework for
understanding the sustained use of these tools by the
two systems examined. The motivation for the use of
the Option Grid at Capital Care was their wish to
achieve success in an external quality improvement
initiative. At HealthPartners, implementation efforts
were motivated by a ‘champion ’physician. The
nursing staff also played a pivotal role by
systematically identifying eligible patients and
providing those patients with the relevant encounter
tool. These organizations, in different ways and to
different degrees, exhibited coherence ,collective action
andcognitive participation that supported the
sustained use of the tools. The organizational
appraisal, in other words, their reflexive monitoring ,
was positive overall, despite concerns about
readability and time pressures.
(Part omitted)
Implementing patient decision aids into clinical
settings is a difficult process ( …) In the UK, an
implementation program known as MAking Good
Decisions In Collaboration (MAGIC) highlighted the
need for an organizational coherence , i.e. a widely held
and agreed understanding of SDM principles in order
to facilitate the implementation of patient decision
aids ( …). Commitment at multiple organizational
levels has been recognized as an important
precondition for implementation ( …). This lack of
commitment was noticeable at the Capital Care sites
that did not use patient encounter tools [ 124].
Differences between participant groups were charac-
terised in 69/108 (64%) studies and between settings in36/108 (33%) studies. For example, Clarke et al. [ 26]
placed this in the wider context of levels of analysis.
‘This paper briefly considers implementation theories
in respect of complex interventions and provides an
overview of process evaluations to set the context for
the study. We draw on Normalisation Process Theory
(NPT) ( …) as a conceptual lens through which to
explore those features of the implementation process
that were intended to secure practice change and to
engage caregivers in the program. We also consider
the interaction between influential macro and micro
contextual factors that affected delivery by multi-
disciplinary stroke unit staff and suggest that prior
focus on generative mechanisms identified within
NPT can be used to inform implementation processes
within complex healthcare settings ’[26].
NPT thus characterises core elements of implementa-
tion processes and the factors that shape them, and
using NPT enabled researchers to explain the ‘work ’that
is involved in implementation. Implementation involves
interactions between mechanisms and contexts that are
highly complex and emergent. Dynamic elements of
context can exercise powerful constraints on action. The
sources of these constraints included system-level pro-
cesses that structured behaviour (e.g. the role of fee for
service payments in undermining the implementation of
self-care programmes [ 43]) and micro-level conflicts
within contexts (e.g. disagreements over participation
and intervention legitimacy [ 20,25]).
How did researchers apply the theory ’s constructs?
Implementation processes in NPT are explained by the
operation of social mechanisms that motivate and shape
collective action. Researchers using the theory employed
its constructs in four distinctive ways, irrespective of the
iteration of the theory that they used. We show exam-
ples of these diagrammatically below. First of all, some
researchers clearly found it helpful to see the theory as
describing a linear process in time [ 22,63], in which the
operation of mechanisms followed sequentially from
each other (Fig. 2). In these studies, sense-making was
seen as a necessary precursor to participation, and a de-
gree of cognitive participation was required before col-
lective action —in the form of an actual implementation
process —could take place. Reflexive monitoring was
seen as the final stage in the implementation process.
However, research reported in this review often focused
on feasibility studies or on the early stages of imple-
mentation life cycles in process evaluation. This skews
their analyses towards the implementation phase of
studies rather than their embedding and integration in
everyday practice.May et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:80 Page 14 of 27
As Fig. 3shows, the focus on the ‘front end ’of studies
l e a d st oa ne m p h a s i so n ‘coherence ’and sense-making
work as an obligatory point of departure for implemen-
tation processes (e.g. [ 27,31,50,52,57,74,85,108,
113,123,131,203]), sometimes at the expense of other
activities. Figure 4suggests a novel analysis of the rela-
tionship between mechanisms. Holtrop et al. examined
the operation of components of collective action in the
restructuring of provider reimbursement. Their analysis
emphasised the role of relational integration as a pre-
condition for normalisation. In this context, the oper-
ation of one mechanism might be an obligatory point
of passage for the others. Holtrop et al. [ 99] state that
‘We found that effective care management
normalization required relationship development
between practice providers and staff and the care
manager. Since identification and referral of patients
needing care management was key to care
management happening at all, the practice personnel
understanding and appreciating the care manager role
through a relationship with the care manager was
critical. This was captured well through the NPT
collective action component of relational integration.We interpreted relational integration to be the
professional relationship development that occurred
when care manager, providers and practice staff work
together and understand and appreciate each other ’s
roles and contribution to patient care. Although it is
its own component in NPT, we found it to be more of
an outcome that occurred when the other components
worked well (contextual integration, skill set workability
and interactional workability). ( …) We found that when
any of the other components were not in place, there
was also a lack of development of trust around shared
patient care. Since care management is a relationship
rich endeavor, the lack of this relationship is a key
factor in care management ’sd i s u s e ’[99].
Finally, as Fig. 5shows, NPT assumes that its constitu-
ent mechanisms can operate simultaneously —but un-
evenly —rather than sequentially. Few studies in this
review tracked the implementation of a complex inter-
vention over its whole life. When they did, they tended
to present summative rather than a formative accounts.
An interesting example of a longitudinal study may be
found in work by Tazzyman et al. [ 148] that depicted
NPT in precisely these terms. They state that the mech-
anisms specified by NPT are
non-linear and interact dynamically to provide a
comprehensive explanation of the implementationFig. 2 Interactions between NPT mechanisms: sequential operation over time (e.g. Alharbi et al. [ 63])
Fig. 3 Interactions between NPT mechanisms: obligatory starting
point (e.g. Finch [ 85])Fig. 4 Interactions between NPM mechanisms: relational integration

processes. NPT was designed to be applied flexibly,
can be used at one or more points in a qualitative
study, has been successfully used beyond its original
field and provides a robust theoretical framework to
understand the dynamics of implementation [ 148].
Tazzyman et al. [ 148] explored the processes that
underpinned revalidation of medical practitioners in a
qualitative study of senior decision-makers undertaken
at three time points (2011, 2013 and 2015). They charac-
terised respondents in their study in NPT terms as ‘sen-
se-makers ’and then explored the process of
implementing and embedding of revalidation as a broad
policy initiative. They state that their contributionhas been to extend the use of NPT to explore the
implementation of a broad and complex policy, with
wide ranging implications for an entire profession,
and the wider healthcare system. Much previous
work using NPT in healthcare has addressed the
implementation of micro level interventions.
This expanded application of NPT has highlighted a
number of factors which seem to have affected the
implementation of revalidation. The four dimensions
of the framework (see Table 3) had an intuitive
relevance and provided a useful explanatory framework
for understanding the implementation of revalidation.
There is scope to apply NPT more widely to complex
social interventions and policy initiatives at the
organisational and system level in future [ 148].
More usually, longitudinal studies using NPT were
process evaluations embedded in large complex inter-
vention trials. As we have noted above and elsewhere
[10], these permitted a more structured analysis of im-
plementation processes and their motivating mecha-
nisms over time [ 29–31,38–41,43–46,50–52].
How did researchers integrate NPT into their research
methods?
Researchers used two main strategies to translate the
constructs of NPT into practically useful analytic tools.
Some used deductive strategies that relied on framework
or directed content [ 204,205] analyses and in which in-
terpretation of data was structured prospectively by the
theory. These approaches often took the form of relatingFig. 5 Interactions between NPT mechanisms: constant interaction
between mechanisms (e.g. Hooker et al. [ 38–41])

data to matrices of varying degrees of complexity. In
Table 3, we show how Alverbratt et al. [ 65] have created
a detailed matrix in which they reinterpret and oper-
ationalise all constructs and sub-constructs of NPT. This
partly replicates the way that these were originally char-
acterised in May and Finch ’s account of NPT [ 7]. This
approach defines and sets out all of the constituent ele-
ments of the work that drives implementation processes
and permits data collection and coding using framework,
or directed, content analysis [ 205]. The approach taken
by Alverbratt et al. focuses on translating the content of
the theory into practical research questions in a very
precise way. Others focused on the main constructs of
the theory prospectively, but within a more flexible
framework. In Table 4, we show how Røsstad et al. [ 122]
set out a matrix that links theory constructs to a descrip-
tion of data collected and in Table 5, we show how Nord-
mark et al. offer an even simpler data matrix, in which
core constructs are linked to data collection opportunities
[116]. Tazzyman et al. [ 148]u s e da na n a l y t i ca p p r o a c hi n -
cluded both deductive and inductive elements.
A coding framework was developed using the four
domains and sub-domains of NPT by using anadapted version of the NoMAD instrument
(part omitted), which was developed to assess
implementation processes (Normalization Measure
Development is an instrument designed for assessing
the implementation of complex interventions).
The adapted NoMaD instrument was applied to the
transcripts by coding evidence of the sub-domains
in Dedoose [ 206]. Following coding, two members of
the research team (AT and JF) analysed the data
across the three interview stages, using the constant
comparative method, in order to understand changes
and continuities over time. The inductive method of
constant comparison analysis involved searching
within individual transcripts, making comparison
between transcripts within the same cohort, and
comparing transcripts from different cohorts for
conceptual similarities and differences. This method
was combined with the deductive approach of using the
four domains on NPT as a framework for the analysis.
Tazzyman et al. ’s hybrid approach enabled them to de-
velop a theory-led analysis, without needing to force
data into a rigid theoretical framework. However, many
studies took a more straightforward inductive approach

to data collection and analysis. When studies collected
and analysed qualitative data inductively —in the light of
NPT—rather than deductively using framework ap-
proaches, there was less pressure on them to interpret
their qualitative data within an inflexible coding frame-
work. For example, in Table 6, we show how Bamford
et al. [ 20] described the ways that their inductively gen-
erated data categories mapped on to NPT constructs.
This group of papers includes a group of highly illumin-
ating studies across the life course of complex interven-
tion trials. Bamford et al. ’s[20] process evaluation of the
CAREDEM trial, and Kennedy et al. ’s[43–46] account
of the WISE trial explain how structural factors mili-
tated against processes of cognitive participation. In
their longitudinal accounts of the MOVE [ 38–41]a n dSTEPPING-UP [ 29–31] Trials, Hooker et al. and Fur-
ler et al. show how mechanisms of coherence, cogni-
tive participation and collective action interact to
support the embedding of complex interventions in
practice. Importantly, thes e studies also showed that
the intervention remained in play once the trials
themselves had concluded.

‘While May et al (…) acknowledge that the NPT
generative mechanisms are in dynamic interaction
with local contexts and external drivers, the
framework primarily addresses the mechanisms.
Indeed, the theory tends to place undue emphasis on
individual and collective agency without explicitly
locating this within, and as shaped by, the
organisational and relational context in which
implementation occurs ’[26].
Segrott et al. [ 126] take this further. They point to
what they perceive as a focus on the agency of those in-
volved in implementation, as opposed to those who ex-
perience the effects of that agency.
‘ENPT places considerable emphasis on the notion of
implementation as an expression of agency. However,
the agents in question appear to be mainly
conceptualised as professional practitioners (e.g.
nurses), rather than the participants who receive
interventions. There is scope to consider further how
the key constructs of ENPT can be applied to
understand how participant (and non-participant)
agency may shape whether interventions become inte-
grated and embedded within delivery systems ’[126]
Beyond this, Alharbi et al. [ 63] criticised NPT for pre-
senting a normative model of implementation that paid
insufficient attention to idealised temporal aspects of im-
plementation, a point echoed by Alverbratt et al. [ 65].
Critique was more often about the interaction between
theory and method. Some articles (9/108) observed that
NPT constructs overlapped, that the technical vocabu-
lary of the theory was difficult and that as a result cod-
ing qualitative data was difficult [ 39,44,48,59,64,67,
82,99,207]. Problems of this nature seemed less evident
when researchers used a more inductive approach to
qualitative data analysis (e.g. [ 25,26,38–41]) than
they did when authors employed a framework ap-
proach (e.g. [ 39,99]).
Discussion
Key results of the review
In this review, we identified 108 discrete studies of com-
plex healthcare interventions and related implementa-
tion processes. These studies were reported in 130
journal articles published after 2008. In papers included
in this review, researchers collected and analysed their
data in ways that effectively provided a basis (i) for inter-
vention design and implementation planning and (ii) for
understanding the dynamics of implementation, embed-
ding and integration. Three key results of the review are
as follows:(a) NPT appears to accurately depict important
elements of implementation processes, and the
constructs of the theory can be applied in a stable
and consistent way within and between studies.
(b) NPT has provided conceptual tools for a large body
of feasibility studies and process evaluations of
complex healthcare interventions. It has
successfully explained the outcome of such
intervention studies.
(c) NPT can be applied flexibly and can be understood
and mobilised by researchers and practitioners with
diverse professional backgrounds, working across a
variety of healthcare settings.
The use of NPT has coalesced around two main types
of study: feasibility studies and process evaluations.
However, unlike McEvoy et al. ’s[17] review of NPT
studies, we found that authors were justifying their
choice of theory, and NPT was more frequently embed-
ded in study protocols and thus being operationalised
prospectively. However, concerns raised by McEvoy
et al. about the lack of prospective application do not
just apply to NPT. For example, Kirk et al. [ 18] point to
the problem of low levels of prospective use of the CFIR
[208] and PARIHS [ 209] frameworks. They point to the
additional problem of lack of integration of theory into
implementation research. Against this background, our
review suggests that —although some authors have expe-
rienced difficulty with NPT ’s technical vocabulary —users
of NPT appear to be able to operationalise its concepts
in consistent, stable ways to inform their work, and we
can see evidence of theoretical integration in four kinds
of studies.
i. Studies constructed with NPT in mind that reflect
its characterisation of implementation processes in
both intervention and evaluation design (e.g. Furler
et al. [ 29–31]).
ii. Studies that used NPT constructs as sensitising
devices to form questions about implementation
processes, and then related their conclusions back
to the predictions of the theory (e.g. Grant et al.
[34,35]).
iii. Studies that collected and analysed data inductively
in the light of NPT and then developed an analysis
of the ways that different mechanisms work to
motivate and shape implementation processes. The
major papers by Clarke et al. [ 34,35] and Hooker
et al. [ 38–41] are important examples of such work.
So too are Kennedy et al. ’s accounts of the WISE
trial [ 43–46].
iv. Studies that treated qualitative data deductively and
used prescheduled coding matrices for framework
or directed content analysis. Nordmark et al. ’s workMay et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:80 Page 19 of 27
[116] offers an example of the way that this
approach to theory driven analysis can be handled
without ‘fitting ’or‘shoehorning ’data in a rigid way
(see MacFarlane and O ’Reilly-de Brún [ 210]o n
techniques to manage this problem in qualitative
research).
These different approaches to mobilising theory sug-
gest that NPT ’s users have developed flexible explana-
tory strategies, and we have pointed to some of these in
Figs. 2,3,4and 5. In earlier papers [ 5–9,11,12], we
have argued that theories are conceptual toolkits that
can be used flexibly to deal with practical problems. This
means that there is no definitive ‘right way ’to employ
NPT. It can be used on its own or in combination with
other theories in ways that are locally defined to solve
problems in intervention design and evaluation.
Limitations of this review
This review contributes to the literature on the incorp-
oration of theory in implementation research, the bene-
fits of this incorporation and the problems that can arise
as a result. There are, of course, limitations to the re-
view. Searches were undertaken in two databases, so it is
possible that some studies were missed. It is question-
able whether this would have altered the main findings
and conclusions. Because Google Scholar is a search en-
gine, and not a database, results of searches using it were
not stable. Searches on Google Scholar also identified
multiple versions of the same reference (e.g. versions of
the published paper on publisher ’s websites, records on in-
stitutional repositories, versions on personal websites and
on academic social media sites such as Academia.edu and
ResearchGate.Com). Sorting these involved significant
additional work. It did however identify about 20 papers
that would not otherwise have been included in the re-
view. One paper was brought to our attention before
appearing in any databases; however, subsequent updated
searches did identify this paper. Equally, we excluded
studies published in languages other than English, al-
though there is some evidence that this is unlikely to be a
major limitation [ 211].
We deliberately followed a two-step approach to data
analysis, first identifying and characterising the use of
NPT in implementation research, and then exploring the
contribution made by NPT to understanding the dynam-
ics of the processes of implementation and integration,
and the limitations of its use. The characterisation is
likely to be replicable by another team, but it is possible
that a different group of researchers, with different back-
grounds and different prior experience of NPT, would
reach different conclusions. We have maximised the ro-
bustness of our findings by following a transparent
process for analysis, including NPT-naïve researchers inthe team, and holding frequent discussions amongst the
team during the analysis. Finally, we made a deliberate
decision to focus solely on the health care literature, and
in light of this decision, our findings only apply to re-
search on implementation in health care.
Next steps for NPT development and empirical research
Most papers in the review used the elaboration of NPT
published by May et al. [ 7,8] in 2009. More recent itera-
tions of the theory have focused on (a) the important
role that social structural and social cognitive features of
context play in mobilisation for implementation [ 9] and
(b) the ways in which implementation processes demand
that their participants negotiate with other actors and el-
ements in the context in which they are set [ 10]. In these
papers, we have already gone some way to answering the
critique of Clarke et al. [ 26] on the relationship between
agency and context. The critique offered by Segrott et al.
[126], however, focused on the experiences of different
groups of actors in implementation processes. They saw
NPT as primarily being about the agency of profes-
sionals, rather than the experiences of patients and other
participants in implementation processes. NPT both can
be, and is, applied to those groups. We have developed
theory in this area to explore the relationship between
the implementation of complex interventions and bur-
den of treatment (e.g. [ 212–215]), and there is now a
discrete body of primary research literature (e.g.
[216–220]) and systematic reviews (e.g. [ 221–223]) that
utilises these theoretical perspectives to understand pa-
tient and caregiver experience.
NPT has developed iteratively. Future work to develop
it will explore variations in the ways that NPT mecha-
nisms motivate and shape implementation processes
across and between settings, and between micro, meso
and macro levels of activity. This will engender a com-
prehensive ‘whole system ’approach to understanding
implementation processes. Future empirical research will
also help us to explore and test the hypothesis that col-
lective action mechanisms operate cumulatively and that
some mechanisms are more significant than others in
determining implementation process outcomes. Rigor-
ous quantitative research will assist in this, but until re-
cently, there has been no robust instrument through
which quantitative investigations of NPT mechanisms
could be done. However, the NoMAD instrument is now
available to perform this task [ 224]. This will make pos-
sible both large-scale and comparative quantitative and
mixed methods studies that will provide important in-
sights into the role of NPT mechanisms and the form
and direction of implementation processes. This should
lead to rigorous statistical models of NPT mechanisms
at work and so to new insights about implementation
processes. Finally, despite attempts to make NPT moreMay et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:80 Page 20 of 27
user friendly through the development of explanatory
toolkits, some users have difficulty with its technical vo-
cabulary. NPT training packages are now coming on
stream that will help to solve this problem [ 225].
Conclusion
Normalization Process Theory appears to offer its users
a coherent and stable set of explanations of implementa-
tion processes. It characterises the mechanisms that mo-
tivate and shape these processes and so can be used to
aid intervention development and implementation plan-
ning as well as evaluating and understanding implemen-
tation processes themselves. In particular, NPT appears
to have offered a valuable set of conceptual tools to
understand the dynamics of implementation within clin-
ical trials. In the future, it will be important to connect
collective action much more closely to context in imple-
mentation studies. Equally, it will be important to de-
velop longitudinal and genuinely mixed methods studies.
These will help us understand not only the dynamics of
implementation but also variations in implementation,
embedding and long-term integration and sustainability
over time and between settings.
