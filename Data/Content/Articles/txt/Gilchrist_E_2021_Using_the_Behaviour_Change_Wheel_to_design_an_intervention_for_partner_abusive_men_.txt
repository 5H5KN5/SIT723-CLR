Abstract
Background: We aimed to establish what core elements were required in a group therapy programme for men
who disclose perpetrating intimate partner abuse in a substance use setting and develop, and test the feasibility of
delivering an intervention in this setting.
Methods: We describe the theoretical development and feasibility testing of an integrated substance use and intimate
partner abuse intervention ( ‘ADVANCE ’) for delivery in substance use services. We employed a comprehensive eight-
stage process to guide this development applying the ‘COM-B ’(‘capability ’,‘opportunity ’,‘motivation ’and‘behaviour ’)
model for intervention design which specifies the following: (1) define the problem, (2) select the target behaviour, (3)
specify the target behaviour, (4) identify what needs to change, (5) identify intervention functions, (6) identify policy
categories, (7) select behaviour change techniques, and (8) design a mode of delivery. The development was informed
by primary research conducted by the authors, consulting with organisation steering groups and by those with
personal experiences. The identified targets for intervention and mode and method of delivery were then refined over
4 intervention development meetings, using the nominal group technique with the ADVANCE experts, then further
refined following consultation with service user groups and wider expert groups via a learning alliance meetings.
Results: Our final intervention, the ADVANCE intervention consisted of a group intervention comprising of up to four
pre-group individual interviews, followed by 12 × 2-h group sessions supported by integrated safety work for victim/
survivors, and risk and safety support and integrity support for the professionals. The main targets for change were
personal goal planning, self-regulation, and attitudes and beliefs supporting intimate partner abuse. The intervention
was regarded as very acceptable to both staff and clients in substance use services, with group attendees reported
positive behaviour changes and development of new skills.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the ability to employ a structured eight-step process to develop an integrated
intervention to address substance use-related intimate partner abuse that is acceptable to staff and clients in substance
use services. This led to a feasibility study (ISRCTN 79435190) involving 104 men and 30 staff at three different locations
across the UK was conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and to refine the content
and approach to delivery (BMC Public Health, 21: 980, 2021).

Introduction
Background
Intimate partner abuse (IPA) or violence (IPV)1refers to
any behaviour within an intimate relationship that
causes physical, psychological, or sexual harm, and in-
cludes not only physical violence but also emotional and
psychological abuse and controlling behaviours [ 70]. IPA
is a prevalent global public health problem with severe
consequences for victims and family members exposed
to the violence and abuse [ 64]. While men can be vic-
tims, IPA disproportionately affects women, with 30%
globally reporting lifetime IPA victimisation [ 70]. Vic-
tims experience physical and mental health problems
and family members, particularly children, experience
adverse health, social, and developmental effects [ 33].
Many factors are associated with the perpetration of
IPA [ 21] with the consensus that there is no single factor
that explains why some men may perpetrate IPA and
not others. These factors impact at individual, commu-
nity, and systemic levels [ 60]. Table 1provides a
summary.
For the purposes of this study, the focus is primarily
on individual and relationship factors, understood
against the background of gendered violence, perpetu-
ated by systems of patriarchal power [ 15,51]. Individual
factors include personality traits, witnessing violence be-
tween parents or experiencing physical violence from
parents in childhood [ 7,30,68], beliefs supportive of
IPA, and mental health problems [ 42,69]. Relationship
factors [ 12] include the status of the relationship (e.g.
marital or co-habiting), relationship conflict, parenting
disagreements, and general stressors linked to factors
such as money, housing, and employment. Relationship
factors can also include the partner ’s personality traits,
substance use status, and history of violence victimisa-
tion [ 54,65]. These factors can operate independently,
summatively, or interactively to increase the likelihood
of IPA.
Interventions addressing IPA
Interventions to reduce IPA include prevention, identifi-
cation, victim support and safeguarding, and perpetrator
programmes [ 66]. These approaches can effectively
occur together, but the focus here is specifically on in-
terventions for male perpetrators of IPA against women.
Current data continues to disproportionately highlight
that women are affected by male perpetration of IPA
[70]. Perpetrator programmes can be effective in redu-
cing IPA [ 31,49], yet no single approach can bedefinitively supported [ 1,49,61]. There is evidence for a
range of approaches with different theoretical stand-
points: feminist-based Duluth model group treatments
[32], cognitive-behavioural interventions, motivational
interviewing [ 49,59,61,66] and motivational enhance-
ment [ 41] or individual motivational input [ 37]. Add-
itionally, there is evidence supporting holistic,
psychoeducational, risk-needs-responsivity and couple
counselling models [ 10,34]. However, issues have been
highlighted for these approaches, particularly when
reviewing recidivism rates (see [ 61] for further discus-
sion on the varied approaches). There is also evidence
that adapting or enhancing ‘batterer intervention pro-
grams ’can add to effectiveness: these can be adaptations
that include an element of restorative justice [ 50] or cul-
tural and language enhancement [ 18]. Evidence suggests
considering adverse childhood experiences [ 19] in theTable 1 Factors affecting likelihood of IPA perpetration (this is a
synthesis of factors identified in recent, relevant international
reviews [ 1,25,31,54,61,66])

1While WHO uses IPV as a current inclusive term for domestic abuse,
we use the term intimate partner abuse (IPA) to avoid focusing on
physical violence, which we feel better reflects an ongoing pervasive
pattern of abuse and avoids focusing on individual incidents.Gilchrist et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:191 Page 2 of 14
perpetrator population [ 28] and incorporating a ‘trauma-
focus ’within the interventions might be of value [ 67],
however, as yet there has been limited evaluation of
trauma-informed approaches to IPA treatment. There
has also been some debate about whether there are sig-
nificant differences between court mandated and ‘volun-
tary’programmes and the effectiveness of both [ 1].
Motivation to engage is important, and coercion into
treatment is not the most effective strategy [ 45]; how-
ever, clinical knowledge suggests that many participants
in both types of programme, both court-mandated pro-
grammes and ‘voluntary ’, are initially extrinsically moti-
vated. This can be either to avoid more serious justice
sanctions, or to achieve another goal, e.g. having been
referred by a partner to prevent them for leaving (some-
times referred to as ‘partner referred ’) or to gain positive
evaluation in relation to some other process, for ex-
ample, to gain a more positive evaluation as a parent in
the context of proceedings relating to child protection
or child contact. Interventions are typically delivered by
social services, criminal justice services, and third sector
organisations. One gap is the delivery of perpetrator in-
terventions in substance use services, which an import-
ant omission is given the impact of substance use (SU)
on IPA.
The interplay between SU and IPA
While substance use has been viewed as an excuse for
IPA perpetration [ 23], there has been increasing ac-
knowledgement of the role of substance use as an aggra-
vating factor [ 36] or a risk factor for IPA [ 44]. Meta-
analyses have shown significant reductions in violence
for men in substance use treatment services [ 31,49] and
subgroup analysis has indicated that treating substance
use in perpetrator programmes potentially enhances out-
comes [ 31]. Recent research has increased the awareness
of the association between substance use and the risk of
IPA incidence and level of injury [ 7,8,35,71]. In
addition to higher rates of substance use among women
who have experienced IPA victimisation [ 9,17,62], IPA
perpetration is more prevalent among men in substance
use treatment when compared with the general popula-
tion [ 16,26]. Despite this, few men attending substance
use treatment who indicate IPA perpetration report hav-
ing ever received support for their violent and control-
ling behaviour [ 6,27].
Stephens-Lewis et al. [ 61] conducted a systematic re-
view and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of perpetra-
tor programmes for men who use substances. The
review identified few trials ( n=9), and of these, five trials
were integrated IPA and substance use programmes.
The meta-analysis within this review showed no differ-
ence in substance use (three trials) or IPA outcomes
(four trials) compared to substance use treatment asusual. However, the small number of studies along with
the heterogeneity of these means that it is premature to
conclude that integrated interventions do not work.
These trials ’results do prompt further questions about
(1) the theory, content, mode of delivery, and duration
and intensity of interventions; (2) the characteristics of
the individuals requiring treatment, including the types
of substances used, the type of abuse perpetrated, and
the nature of the relationship between substance use
and IPA perpetration; and (3) what outcomes are
assessed, where information is sourced, and the duration
of follow-up.
In beginning to address these questions, Gilchrist et al.
[25] conducted a meta-ethnography of qualitative studies
to explore how substance use features in survivors ’and
perpetrators ’accounts of IPA. The themes identified re-
lated to the complex interplay between substance use
and IPA in the context of intoxication, withdrawal and
addiction, the impact on relationships, wider dynamics
of power and control, and psychological vulnerabilities.
Survivors were more likely to see substance-related IPA
as part of a pattern of abusive behaviour, whereas perpe-
trators tended to describe a causal relationship between
intoxication and discrete incidents of IPA perpetration.
Irritability and frustration during withdrawal from or
craving for alcohol or drugs, and/or a partner ’s refusal
or failure to obtain money for alcohol or drugs increased
the likelihood of violence. Survivors were more likely to
identify abuse being related to substance use, and to
focus on how substances impacted their relationship and
dynamics of power and control. Perpetrators perceive a
change in self, which enables their abusive behaviour.
Behaviour change interventions need to reframe such
narratives so that perpetrators take accountability for the
abuse. This is key to enhancing self-responsibility and
thus a willingness to change. These findings highlight
the complex interplay between psycho-pharmacological
effects of substances, gendered power relations and con-
trolling behaviours that behavioural interventions should
address.
Building on this, interviews were conducted with in-
timate partner (current and/or ex) dyads, where men
were receiving treatment for substance use and who re-
ported IPA perpetration [ 22,55]. Similar to the meta-
ethnography, analysis found that ‘the psychopharmaco-
logical effects of substance use (including intoxication,
craving, and withdrawal) were rarely the only explan-
ation offered for IPA ’but often intensified conflicts. Fe-
male partners of men in treatment for substance use
described experiencing patterns of abusive behaviour
often associated with their partner being intoxicated,
craving or withdrawing from substances, including con-
flict resulting from the need to raising funds for
substances. More specifically, substances can beGilchrist et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:191 Page 3 of 14
independently implicated in the perpetration of coercive
control, in that perpetrators may control their partners
by increasing their substance dependency or restricting
access to substances. This may continue to entrap
women within an abusive relationship. Hence, there is a
complex relationship between substance use and IPA,
with an interplay between intoxication, acquiring sub-
stances, craving, withdrawal, gender power relations, and
control, all of which should be considered when design-
ing perpetrator programmes.
There were several implications from this research.
There is limited evidence of effective interventions tar-
geting substance using men who perpetrate IPA. There
is also a need to recognise a number of factors that cor-
relate with substance use and IPA. There is a need for
tailored interventions that address the complex ways
that substance use and IPA perpetration intersect in re-
lation to social, psychological, and environmental fac-
tors. While power and control are implicit in
understanding IPA perpetration, interventions for those
men within substance use treatment should also address
key risk areas, including intoxication, anger, trauma,
grief, dependency [ 22], and the presence of mental
health issues such as anxiety and depression [ 35]. Inter-
ventions should be tailored and use personal goals to ad-
dress individual need. Integrated interventions for SU/
IPA should also address intoxication, craving, with-
drawal, acquisition of the substance using lifestyle, the
intricate interdependencies within substance using rela-
tionships, and the gendered power dynamics underpin-
ning substance use and IPA.
The ADVANCE intervention
The ADVANCE intervention, funded by the UK Na-
tional Institute for Health Research, aimed to fill a gap
in perpetrator programmes by developing and evaluating
an integrated substance use and IPA perpetrator
programme specifically for men in substance use treat-
ment services whose substance use and IPA are associ-
ated and interconnected. This new voluntary (i.e. non-
court mandated) programme aims to reduce or stop
men ’s IPA through a focus on both substance use and
IPA and on their interconnection exclusively for this cli-
ent group, who have not presented specifically for help
with IPA. The underpinning belief within the AD-
VANCE programme is that the programme will support
positive change irrespective as to whether participants
are extrinsically motived to start. Whatever the initial
motivation is, we believe that by setting personal goals,
promoting enlightened self-interest and offering positive
incentives, this can support positive change and may de-
velop intrinsic motivation within the group. This paper
sets out how the ADVANCE intervention was developed
from the evidence base and literature. The developmentof the intervention was guided by an eight-stage inter-
vention design process. Hoddinott [ 29] noted the im-
portance of intervention development studies, namely
studies that describe ‘the rationale, decision making pro-
cesses, methods and findings which occur between the
idea or inception of an intervention until it is ready for
formal feasibility, pilot or efficacy testing prior to a full
trial or evaluation ’(p. 1). A description of the design and
development of the intervention facilitates understand-
ing of the intervention and how the components con-
tribute to the whole, thereby enhancing implementation
according to the underlying rationale and paving the
way for future quality improvement by elucidating as-
pects that may need to be changed. O ’Cathain et al. [ 53]
have identified a range of approaches to intervention de-
velopment. A theory and evidence-based approach was
the principal method used in ADVANCE, using the Be-
haviour Change Wheel.
Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW)
The BCW was developed to identify the type of inter-
vention that would be the most appropriate to effect the
desired change in a particular domain [ 48]. Underpin-
ning the BCW is the COM-B model of behaviour, the
initials of which stand for capability (C), opportunity
(O), motivation (M), and the behavioural outcome (B)
(see Fig. 1). This concentric model identifies a number
of domains that influence behaviour, integrates and
maps out the drivers of behaviour, and links these with
intervention functions and policy strategies. The inter-
vention functions include education, persuasion, incenti-
visation, coercion, training, restriction, environmental
restructuring, modelling, and enablement. The model is
a helpful tool for the development of rigorously designed
interventions prior to controlled trials [ 47].
The COM-B model can be further elaborated using
the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), which sub-
divides the COM-B components in a clinically useful
way by specifically identifying 14 domains that drive be-
haviour [ 11]. These are knowledge; skills; memory, at-
tention, and decision processes; behavioural regulation;
social/professional role and identity; beliefs about cap-
abilities; optimism; beliefs about consequences; inten-
tions; goals; reinforcement; emotion; environmental
context and resources; and social influences [ 46]. The
BCW, based upon the COM-B and TDF, sets out a com-
prehensive eight-stage process for intervention design:
(1) define the problem, (2) select the target behaviour,
(3) specify the target behaviour, (4) identify what needs
to change, (5) identify intervention functions, (6) identify
policy categories, (7) select behaviour change techniques,
and (8) design a mode of delivery.

velopment of an integrated IPA and substance useGilchrist et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:191 Page 4 of 14
intervention for male IPA perpetrators in substance use
services. The process through which the intervention
was developed will be described. The implementation of
the resultant ADVANCE intervention to check on viabil-
ity in practice will be reported briefly.
Materials and methods
Aim, design, and setting
This study reports the rationale, decision-making pro-
cesses, methods, and findings which were used to de-
velop a theory and evidence-based intervention for
perpetrators of IPA attending substance use treatment —
the ADVANCE intervention.
Materials and processes
We based the development of the ADVANCE interven-
tion on existing research and systematic reviews con-
ducted by the authors including a systematic review of
IPA interventions for perpetrators who used substances
[61], a meta-ethnography of qualitative studies investi-
gating the role of substance use and IPA [ 25], and inter-
views with couple dyads (i.e. perpetrators and victims of
IPA) [ 22,55].
In order to translate the current evidence related to
both IPA and substance use into an integrated approach
and guide the intervention design, a multi-disciplinary
group came together and followed the steps of the BCW
[47]. The team members came from psychology, addic-
tion, public health, IPA, and behaviour change back-
grounds. The design team and key stakeholders
developed materials collaboratively over several months.Additionally, Learning Alliance groups (consisting of
professionals and academics) and a Public and Patient
Involvement Group (PPI) were constituted and con-
sulted about its development at key points; their contin-
ued feedback informed the process.
Thus, the method was consultation and consensus,
with the core team discussing research and practice,
drafting proposals which were then taken to Learning
Alliances and PPI Groups for discussion which was fed
back to the core group, and amendments were made ac-
cordingly and the final programme agreed by consensus.
Nominal Group Techniques (NGT) were used with the
two Learning Alliances (total of 20 key stakeholders) to
reach consensus on the intervention targets and content
[40]. During these small group discussions, information
was presented, then members were asked to write down
their thoughts independently, then every member shared
their feedback to the group which were recorded on a
flipchart. These were then discussed and prioritised until
consensus was reached on the goals for treatment and
mechanisms by which change could be achieved. The
main ideas were incorporated to strengthen the inter-
vention, safeguarding, and engagement including making
it more trauma informed, making gender roles and be-
liefs more explicit throughout all sessions, ensuring
regular case management between the substance use ser-
vice and the integrated safety service, and that the facili-
tator should follow up men who missed a session to
encourage them to re-engage and also to ‘check-in ’after
the sensitive session on the impact of their behaviour on
their children.

People with lived experience were also consulted in
small PPI groups (3 women and 10 men). They advised
about the structure, approach and content of the interven-
tion, as well as suggestions for enhancing engagement and
retention. Their feedback was also incorporated including
the need for the intervention to be as interactive as pos-
sible and the need to establish ground rules around confi-
dentiality and to challenge men ’s privilege/gender
stereotypical beliefs about roles and norms. They also sug-
gested the provision of a break out space with staff avail-
able to support if men wish to leave a group session for
whatever reason and highlighted the importance of trying
to re-engage men who had not attended a session and
catching them up on what they had missed before the
next session to encourage attendance.
In accordance with the BCW, we followed an eight-
stage process for intervention design: (1) define the
problem, (2) select the target behaviour, (3) specify the
target behaviour, (4) identify what needs to change, (5)
identify intervention functions, (6) identify policy cat-
egories, (7) select behaviour change techniques, and (8)
design a mode of delivery. The ‘Results ’section describes
these steps.
Results
Each of the steps of intervention development is de-
scribed below.
Step 1: Define the problem
As we have shown, there is a lack of targeted effective
interventions to reduce or stop IPA among male perpe-
trators receiving treatment for substance use. Perpetra-
tor interventions do not address the complex role that
substance use plays in IPA perpetration. The target
population was men attending community services for
drug and/or alcohol use in England.
Step 2: Select the target behaviour
The aim is to reduce or stop men ’s perpetration of IPA
in the context of substance use.
The team members ’previous research identified a lack
of understanding by perpetrators of the range of ways
that substance use could impact on their IPA behaviour,
and a reluctance to acknowledge the impact of their
abusive behaviour on others [ 22,56]. Our research also
identified that there was a simplistic understanding of
the impact of substances on them, often linked to simple
intoxication and discussion of pharmacological effects
rather than an acknowledgement of the impact of life-
style, withdrawal, need, or intoxication and how these
related to beliefs around the right to control partners
[22,56]. Therefore, reducing, or quitting substance use
is important, but in pursuit of this conveying a nuanced
understanding of the complex role of substance use onIPA is vital. Participants in the intervention may require
a fuller understanding of the rationale for changing sub-
stance use and the positive impact on their relationship
of doing so; consequently, it can be expected that their
motivation to change will be enhanced. Positive impacts
on other aspects of life are likely from reducing sub-
stance use, including improved physical and mental
health, financial benefits, and fewer life crises. In sum-
mary, ADVANCE targets men ’s IPA in the context of
substance use by addressing the following three areas:
(1) promoting respectful egalitarian behaviours, (2) pro-
moting alternatives to violent and aggressive behaviour,
and (3) reducing substance use.
Step 3: Specify the target behaviour
In specifying the target behaviour, the BCW guidebook
recommends consideration of who, what, when, where,
and with whom ([ 48], p189). We would add ‘why’as also
being necessary as by understanding the function of the
behaviour it may become easier to understand how to
change it. The target behaviour therefore would be for
male substance users who have perpetrated IPA (who),
to cease IPA (what), at all times (when), in all relation-
ship settings (where), against intimate partners (whom)
in the context of substance use (why). Subsequently the
three main target areas to address all issues were identi-
fied as being:
(1) Promoting respectful egalitarian behaviours
a. Identify the function of abusive behaviours within
relationships
b. Identify alternative goals and methods of achieving
them for each man
c. Focus on control of self, not control of others
(2) Promoting alternatives to violent and aggressive
behaviour
a. Increase distress tolerance: in crisis and generally
b. Increase recognition of negative mood and internal
triggers
c. Promote emotional self-regulation
(3) Reducing substance use
a. Increase awareness of personal function of
substance useGilchrist et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:191 Page 6 of 14
b. Increase awareness of the relationship between
substance use and IPA
c. Plan to avoid IPA risk related to substance:
acquisition, intoxication, withdrawal
Step 4: Identify what needs to change
The ADVANCE intervention proposes that change is fa-
cilitated by increasing understanding of the function of
aggressive and abusive behaviours and the contribution
made by substance use and gendered attitudes. The
intervention promotes motivation by increasing partici-
pants ’recognition of areas that need to change and in-
creasing participants ’capabilities by introducing skills
for change. ADVANCE aims to highlight individual risks
for IPA, including substance use, poor emotional regula-
tion, and poor stress-coping, and teach participants how
to reduce these risks by promoting self-regulation, and
personal goal setting.
Self-regulation refers to an individual ’s ability to alter a
response or override a thought, feeling, or impulse [ 3–
5]. Self-regulatory deficits have demonstrated promise in
promoting abstinence from the hazardous use of sub-
stances [ 52]. In terms of IPA, dips in self-regulation have
been indicative of perpetration [ 20]. Also, the ability to
inhibit an impulse towards abusive behaviour in the con-
text of intimate partner abuse is affected by substances,
as highlighted in the multiple thresholds model. This
model posits that substances change the balance be-
tween ‘instigating and inhibiting ’factors. People affected
by substances focus more on cues that instigate abuse
and are less able to inhibit abuse [ 35]. Strengthening the
ability to read environmental cues accurately, avoid mis-
reading natural cues as aggressive, and manage the im-
pulse to abuse, even when affected by substances, is
indicated.
Personal goal planning using SMART goal setting (this
model, drawn from business, encourages precision in
planning requiring aspirations to be specific, measurable,
achievable, relevant, and time-limited) [ 38] is used in the
ADVANCE model to enhance task completion by mak-
ing all goals personal, explicit, and specific. These goals
address reduction in substance use as well as building
positive relationships and healthy lifestyles. Personal
goals that are SMART, along with self-regulation en-
hance engagement and self-efficacy.
Step 5: Identify intervention functions
Derived from the analysis of risk factors (Table 1) and
potential intervention targets, Table 2outlines the inter-
vention functions for men in substance use treatment
who perpetrate IPA. The nine intervention functions
which we describe the development of ADVANCE are
education (knowledge), persuasion (increasing desire),
incentivisation (rewarding), coercion (increasingpotential negative consequences), training (skills), re-
striction (rules/laws to prohibit undesired behaviour or
promote desired behaviour), environmental restructuring
(physical changes to facilitate desired behaviour), model-
ling (demonstrating), and enablement (removing barriers
to facilitate positive behaviours).
The APEASE criteria of Affordability, Practicability,
Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, Acceptability, Side
effects/safety, and Equity considerations [ 46] were used
in making context-based decisions on the content of in-
terventions. The method here was also consultation and
consensus. Thus, we selected the intervention functions
that were possible to implement, linked with the evi-
dence from previous empirical studies, and linked with
clinical knowledge about what has been found to be ef-
fective with IPA and substance use populations.
From our research, education in IPA, substance use,
and the interaction between these criteria and studies
was key. Training and modelling would provide alterna-
tive strategies to interpret environmental cues, while en-
hancing self-regulation and distress tolerance and
reducing the need for control within intimate relation-
ships. Incentivisation was through offering a £5 voucher
for every session attendance, which men would accumu-
late over the duration of the intervention for use in a
pro social activity they chose (such as cinema tickets or
restaurant vouchers). Vouchers are provided at session 6
and session 12. Persuasion to attend was identified as
being helpful in promoting reflective and automatic mo-
tivation [ 39]. Enablement was envisaged as being deliv-
ered at a more structural level in terms of setting the
intervention within a multi-disciplinary framework to
work with the perpetrator to manage risk and to remove
barriers to help seeking and promoting safety manage-
ment for partners of the perpetrating men.
Based on the ‘what works ’body of knowledge from foren-
sic psychology, the intervention was delivered in line with
best practice for enhancing motivation and responsivity and
was culturally competent, used active learning methods, vis-
ual and auditory materials. Th e intervention was manualised
to maximise the integrity of the intervention. In line with the
best practice guidelines of RESPECT, a UK non-
Governmental domestic violence organisation, ADVANCE
was designed as a group work int ervention to facilitate peer
challenge and maximise positive learning based on the zone
of proximal learning; and reflecting the goal of enablement.
Step 6: Identify policy categories
While the ADVANCE intervention focused mostly at
the individual change level, it was delivered alongside
proactive support, case management, and information
sharing to manage risk and promote safety with partners
and ex-partners of men in the group and was fully em-
bedded within the justice, social services, and childGilchrist et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:191 Page 7 of 14
protection systems structures to allow risk management
and referral. This inclusion fits with best practice models
[48,49,57,58,63] for IPA intervention developed from
Duluth onwards and supported by RESPECT, and is in

men in substance use treatment who perpetrate IPA. In
summary, for ADVANCE, we aimed to improve capabil-
ity by the strategies described in Fig. 2.
Step 8: Modes of delivery
Applying best practice from the ‘what works ’literature
and RESPECT, the intervention was primarily face-to-
face structured group work. Prior to group work, indi-
vidual sessions assessed the client ’s IPA, substance use,
and motivation to change. Within groups, a range of
modes was used: illustrative handouts of basic concepts,
individual worksheets, and exercises conducted in pairs
and small groups, role plays, between-session assign-
ments, group ’s discussion, presentations, and skills prac-
tice. A major innovation was the inclusion of video
scenarios which were enactments of interactions derivedfrom an amalgamation of individual stories within the
dyad research [ 55] used as a focus for group discussion.
Nominal Group Technique
Following the initial identification of content and ap-
proach, a nominal group approach was implemented to
refine the content in light of expert knowledge [ 13]. The
nominal group technique took the form of 4 stages
across a number of face-to-face meetings at which writ-
ten records were kept and actions and revisions of mate-
rials were circulated after each meeting.
1. Initial themes drawn from the research and the
systematic review identified key elements that
needed to be included, e.g. CBT, integrated model,
and strong motivational element, and identified
topics to cover, e.g. including sexual jealousy and

control, and the complex model of substance and
IPV interactions and created an initial proposal
which was discussed and refined by the team of
experts from clinical psychology, forensic
psychology, addictions, victim support, and IPV
accreditation group.
2. Evidence from ‘what works ’literature, the Risk
Needs Responsivity model and the Good Lives
model, alongside the addictions literature, were
then used to translate the topics into key targets for
the intervention with proposed delivery approaches.
3. These key targets (Table 2) were then discussed and
refined with input from experts and a proposed
model with session content was developed.
4. The proposed model, session content, delivery style,
and ethos were then created into programme
manuals and materials which were reviewed by the
expert group and then presented to the wider
expert group through two learning alliances, at
which feedback was noted, then a summary actions
of what MUST be changed, what might be changed
and what would not be changed were made, and
then these changes were implemented to create the
pilot intervention.
As the next stage in the ADVANCE programme was a
pilot study focusing on feasibility and acceptability, there
was no specific pilot conducted; however, patient-public
consultation (PPI consultation) was undertaken with
men and women how they had been affected by IPV to
ensure the acceptability and clarity of the language, the
acceptability of the content, and the acceptability within
the pilot intervention.
PPI feasibility consultation
The PPI consultation involved 3 men and 5 women. The
consultation took the form of p resenting proposed content
and with prompts, and noting the responses which were
then collated to create summarises, which were then dis-
cussed as a team, and dominant threads of what could be
adjusted without moving too far from the underpinning
model incorporated. For example, initial plans for the inter-
vention were initially ‘wordy ’; however, following consult-
ation, our examples and worksheets were revised to use
more pictures and example s and less dense language.
ADVANCE model
The ADVANCE intervention consisted of up to four
pre-group individual sessions to assess and motivate par-
ticipants. These sessions helped each participant con-
sider their motivation for taking part, translated that
into individual goals, and addressed any additional sup-
port needs to facilitate engagement, followed 12 × 2-h
group sessions (see Table 3). The intervention wasdelivered by substance use service workers trained in its
delivery. Key workers contacted participants by tele-
phone between sessions to deal with problems and mo-
tivate individuals to attend the next session. Integrated
Support Services (ISS) workers provided support to par-
ticipants ’current/ex partner ’s at least three times across
the intervention period on their current/ex-partner ’s at-
tendance and progression, with the consent of the par-
ticipants. ISS workers attended case management
meetings with the group facilitators and substance use
workers (approximately five times across the duration of
the research) to ensure good communication and to
manage any risk.
Discussion
In developing the ADVANCE intervention, we accessed
various theoretical models and frameworks to inform
the content and approach. It used the BCW to translate
this theoretical knowledge into specific targets for
change and specific intervention approaches. In describ-
ing the approach and the resultant ADVANCE interven-
tion, we have satisfied Hoddinott's [ 29] call for studies
that describe the rationale, processes, and methods used
in developing an intervention. Thus, we can claim that
the ADVANCE intervention has been developed using a
rigorous methodology, in particular the use of an explicit
statement of the theory-based targets for change and of
the appropriate mechanisms by which change should be
supported. The systematic application of the BCW
meant that the specific methods used were selected with
reference to the type of change desired, namely im-
proved capability, opportunity, or motivation.
This approach resulted in an intervention that met its
key aim of addressing both IPA and substance use in an
integrated fashion rather than addressing them as two
separate problems. The intervention differed from other
perpetrator programmes by offering specific knowledge
and related skills that addressed both IPA and substance
use in each session. It also incorporated other main-
stream factors involved in IPA, namely masculine power,
control, beliefs and attitudes, and aggression emanating
from emotion dysregulation. It also explicitly used a
multifaceted model of the range of links between the
various aspects of substance use namely intoxication,
withdrawal and physiological discomfort, drug seeking
and acquisition, substance using lifestyle, and a gendered
view of substance use.
The utility of applying the BCW model was the
specificity and clarity brought to the intervention.
Previous intervention development studies using the
BCW state that the use of a ‘comprehensive supra-
theory model ’[2] allowed the developers to access
multi-factor models and more than one theory of
change, for example, including use of incentives toGilchrist et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:191 Page 10 of 14
encourage behaviour change based on behavioural
principles alongside self-regulation such as effort
regulation and attentional focus based on psycho-
logical principles. The challenges of applying this
model were that it constrained the focus of the inter-
vention to something that could be explicitly stated
and potentially constrained the intervention devel-
opers from including more holistic targets, for ex-
ample improvement on more global but less specific
measures of well-being, life satisfaction or self-love as
intervention goals.Strengths and limitations
This study strengthens the theoretical foundations on
which to develop integrated interventions for IPA and
substance to reduce or stop IPA. There has long been a
call for integrated aggression and substance use inter-
ventions, yet true integration has been rare in interven-
tions for general aggression [ 43] and for IPA [ 61]. One
of the limitations is the difficulty in capturing each level
of any factor that can contribute to IPA. By its very na-
ture a programme focussing on individuals will over-
emphasise the role of individual factors so there is aTable 3 ADVANCE sessions

danger of minimising the ongoing need to also address
societal and structural factors which could be problem-
atic. Also, it is very difficult to know to what extent the
observed factors associated with IPA contribute to dif-
ferent types of IPA (for instance physical violence versus
coercive control) in different groups of perpetrators (for
instance those of different ethnicity and different sexual
orientation) in different contexts. Across this process,
these issues have been addressed by taking common fea-
tures and common pathways to identify possible routes
and motives for IPA that should address the main fea-
tures for a majority of substance using men within a UK
context: it will not cover all needs and pathways and it is
unlikely to address the needs of those from different cul-
tures and contexts.
Implications
The original intervention was refined following the PPI
feasibility consultations, and the content of sessions
honed and the delivery and training refined to produce a
better more polished version of the original, but still in
line with the BCW principles. This intervention develop-
ment led onto a feasibility randomised controlled trial
(RCT) among 104 male perpetrators attending substance
use treatment in England. The full details are reported
elsewhere [ 14,24], but in brief this study identified that
it was possible for trained substance use staff to deliver
the ADVANCE intervention in substance use treatment
services and that men who attended and staff who deliv-
ered the intervention evaluated it highly. Following this,
a full-scale, multi-site randomised controlled trial to
compare the effectiveness of the ADVANCE interven-
tion plus substance use treatment as usual (TAU) to
substance use TAU only, and a nested process evalu-
ation will explore the ‘what works and how and for
whom ’was planned. However due to Covid-19 restric-
tions, it was not possible to conduct the trial. The AD-
VANCE intervention has now been adapted for digital
delivery and further feasibility testing is being under-
taken. This will in turn help develop the theoretical un-
derstanding of what features are necessary and sufficient
for IPA to occur in men who use substances in a UK
context and refine knowledge of how best to target re-
lated risks to reduce incidence.
Conclusion
IPA in substance use populations is high. Traditional in-
terventions are not effective overall, and additionally
those who are substance users are often screened out of
generic interventions due to the need to address their
substance use first. Using the BCW it was possible to
systematically develop an integrated intervention based
on what is known about IPA and substance use andmaking use of theoretically informed behaviour change
mechanisms.
