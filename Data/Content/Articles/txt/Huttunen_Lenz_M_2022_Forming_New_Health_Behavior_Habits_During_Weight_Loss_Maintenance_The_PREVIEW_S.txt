Abstrac t 125 
Changing lifestyle habits to achieve  and maintain weight  loss can be effective in 126 
prevention of type 2 diabetes . Ability to resist temptations is  considered one of the key 127 
factors in behaviour change. This study examine d how both habit -strength , motivation,  and 128 
temptations  for an energy -dense  diet developed  during the maintenance stage  of a behaviour 129 
modification intervention  tool. Participants  with prediabetes and overweight/obesity were 130 
recruited in the two-phase trial PREVIEW with the aim to achieve ≥8% body weight  loss 131 
over 2 months, and maintain weight  loss over a subsequent 34-month period. The four-stage 132 
intervention  (PREMIT ) supported participants  in weight -maintenance . Uni - and multivariate 133 
analyses were completed from the beginning of the PREMIT maintenance stage ( week 2 6 of 134 
the PREVIEW trial ) with 962 individuals who completed the trial. Habit -strength and ability 135 
to resist temptation s increase d during the early PREMIT adherence stage  (weeks 26 to 52) 136 
before plateau ing during middle (weeks 52 to 104) and late  (weeks 104 to 156)  PREMIT 137 
adherence stages. Higher  habit -strength for energy dense diet was significantly associated 138 
with larger  weight -regain  (p ≤ .007 ). No changes in motivation or interaction with PREMIT 139 
attendance were observed . Changing diet habits  is a complex, multifactorial process  with 140 
participants struggling at least with some aspects of weight maintenance.  Habits  against 141 
consuming energy dense, sweet and fatty, food appeared effective in protecting  against  142 
weight re -gain. The observed effect sizes were  small  reflecting the complex ity of breaking 143 
old habits and form ing new ones to support long term maintenance of weight loss .  144

HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  7 
Introduction  150 
Habits such as physical inactivity  or eating an energy -dense diet with high saturated 151 
fat and added sugar  are major risk factor s for develop ing type 2 diabetes  (T2D) (Chan & Luk, 152 
2016) . Several  studies have shown that progression from  prediabetes to T2D can be 153 
prevented by modifying lifestyle habits such as an energy -dense  diet and physical inactivity  154 
(Dombrowski et al., 2014; Lindström et al., 2003; Tamayo et al., 2014) . However, 155 
maintenance of weight  loss can be  difficult  to achieve  (Dombrowski et al., 2014; G ardner et 156 
al., 2012; Rockette -Wagner et al., 2017) .  157 
Motivation , whether externally controlled through pressure and incentives to behav e 158 
in a certain way or internally controlled through value placed on the behaviours, is an 159 
important determinant of  successful behaviour change and maintenance (R. Ryan & Deci, 160 
2000) . Resisting temptations  (i.e. resisting  a desire to do something that one should not ) is 161 
central  during formation of  new behaviours  (Hausenblas et al., 2001) . Temptations  to 162 
consume  energy -dense  food or high added sugar diets , arise especially  when cognitive 163 
functions such as  planning and problem solving are disrupted by stress, insufficient sleep, and 164 
facing  tempting stimuli  (Appelhans et al., 2016; Burke et al., 2018) . Research has suggested 165 
that h ealthy h abits like being physically active  or avoiding convenien ce foods, for instance , 166 
protect against temptations  to consume energy -dense foods (Appelhans et al., 2016) . Habits  167 
reduce  demands on cognitive function  necessary to resist temptations  when, for example, 168 
tired or stressed  (Appelhans et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016) .  169 
Habits describe automated behaviours  (automaticity) , triggered by situational cues (de 170 
Vries et al., 2014; Gardner et al., 2015) , and formed through repeated performance (Gardner, 171 
2012) . Once formed, a habit does no t need frequent repetition. Essential  for a habit is a cue - 172 
dependent automaticity . Habit -strength is a function of the frequency of an action retrieved in 173 
a stable context which has acquired a high degree of automaticity (de Vries et al., 2014; 174 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  8 
Gardner et al., 2015; Labrecque & Wood, 2015 ). Habit-strength plateaus when a behaviour 175 
becomes automated (Lally et al., 2010)  and is a strong  predict or for future behaviours 176 
(Verhoeven et al., 2012) . Furthermore, research has indicated that autonomous motivation, 177 
i.e. behaviours done due their own value not because external or internal rewards or threats, is 178 
associated with positive changes in health habits  and better health outcomes  (Ng et al., 2012; 179 
Ntoumanis et al., 2021) .  180 
Previously, both individual  (Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Research Group, 181 
2002)  and group formats (The Look AHEAD Research Group, 2014)  have been successfully 182 
used to achieve  weight loss and weight loss maintenance. In the AHEAD study, group 183 
sessions introduced participants to behavioural weight maintenance techniques,  and those 184 
who struggled with weight loss, received additional, individual, interventions (The Look 185 
AHEAD Research Group, 2006) . Similarly, PREMIT (PREVIEW - Behaviour -Modification - 186 
Intervention -Toolbox), which formed a part of an international T2D prevention study 187 
PREVIEW  (Kahlert et al., 2016; Raben et al., 2021)  support ed the formati on of healthy 188 
eating habit s, using group  sessions with same content for all participants  to target  behavioural 189 
determinants  such as motivation or self-efficacy  associated with habit -formation  (Figure 1)  190 
(Bandura, 1996; Michie et al., 2008; Richard Ryan et al., 2008) .  191 
Behaviour modification is a complex endeavour requiring initiating and maintaining 192 
new behaviours (Ryan et al., 2008) . In most studies using a theory -based approach the focus 193 
is on the effectiveness of the behaviour change techniques in reaching the intervention 194 
outcome (e. g. increasing the physical activity volume). In this study a theory -based approach 195 
was employed to examine the intervening mechanisms or determinants leading to the 196 
outcomes (Bauman et al., 2002; Craig et al., 2008) . It was assessed how habi t-strength, 197 
motivation, and temptations for energy -dense food (e.g. consuming or buying food high in fat 198 
or sugar) var ied during the maintenance stage of PREMIT ( weeks 26 - 156 of the PREVIEW 199 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  9 
RCT ), which formed a part of an international T2D prevention study PREVIEW (Raben et 200 
al., 2021). Previously published results from weeks 8 - 26 showed that frequent PREMIT 201 
attendance was associated with lower habit -strength for an energy -dense food and lower 202 
weight re -gain (Huttunen -Lenz et al., 2019) . 203 
(1) Following hypothesis were formed : (a) in the early maintenance  stage  (week s 26 - 204 
52) – when new habits  were  formed  – decreas ing habit -strength  for energy -dense  food was 205 
associated  with decreasing temptations for energy -dense  food and with increas ing 206 
autonomous and intrinsic motivation as well as with increasing  ability  to resist  temptations ; 207 
(b) during middle  (weeks 52 - 104) and late (weeks 104 -156) maintenance stage s habit - 208 
strength , autonomous motivation, temptations and resisting  temptations would have reach ed a 209 
plateau , while extrinsic and intrinsic motivations decrease ; (c) the hypothesised effects are 210 
moderated by attendance at the  PREMIT group session s. (2) As habit formation in 211 
PREVIEW was no t an end in itself , but conducive to prevent  weight  re-gain, it was 212 
hypothesised that higher resistance  to temptations , higher autonomous motivation,  and lower 213 
habit -strength  at week 156  were associated with lower weight re-gain. (3) Finally, it was 214 
hypothesised that more frequent PREMIT attendance wa s associated with lower weight re - 215 
gain.  216 
Methods  217 
Study design  218 
The PREVIEW randomised controlled trial (RCT) comprised two phases . Phase I was 219 
an 8-week weight loss phase using a low-energy diet (Cambridge Weight Plan Ltd., Corby, 220 
UK). Phase II was a 34-month weight -maintenance phase for participants  who had lost ≥8% 221 
of initial body weight during Phase I. Before starting p hase II, eligible  participants were 222 
randomi sed into different intervention arms  with a 2 x 2 diet and physical activity  factorial 223 
design (high er protein with lower glycemic index (GI) diet , or moderate protein with medium 224 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  10 
GI diet ; high-intensity physical activity or moderate -intensity physical activity).  The full 225 
study protocol and the main results have been  published elsewhere (Raben et al., 2021) . 226 
A transtheoretical approach allow ed using different theories or theoretical models and 227 
techniques to support participants moving forward in their targeted behaviour change from 228 
one stage to another. PREMIT was designed to support diet and physical activity habit 229 
changes  and was integral to the PREVIEW RCT. The PREMIT was based among others (e. 230 
g., Health Action Process Approach Schwarzer et al., 2008)  on the transtheoretical stage 231 
model by Prochaska & DiClemente  (1992) . PREMIT used behavioural change techniques to 232 
encourage new behaviours to imbed into habits (Michie et al., 2008) .  233 
As shown in figure 1, PREMIT followed four stages (stage 1 preliminary, stage 2 234 
preparation, stage 3 action, stage 4 maintenance) (Kahlert et al., 2016) . During the PREVIEW 235 
study the participants were invited to follow a regimen of 18 group sessions. PREMIT s tages 236 
followed a time division (starting in week 0 of Preview and ending in week 156). Participants 237 
following the PREVIEW study regimen were  allocate d in general to the different stages  as 238 
the study progressed , but they were not assessed individually if they had reached a specific 239 
consciousness stage. PREMIT maintenance stage was divided additionally into an early  (3 240 
sessions) , middle (3 sessions), and late (2 session) stage . This was done to reflect the main 241 
contents in the group session and the frequency of over the time (Figure 1).   242 
The PREMIT  was delivered by counsellors in groups of 10 - 20 participants . The 243 
overall approach was consistent across all four PREVIEW arms, irrespective of diet or 244 
exercise  RCT  assignment. As the main results indicated no significant differences between 245 
the groups in T2D incidence or weight change (Rabe n et al., 2021) , for the purposes of the 246 
analyses here, participants were considered  as a one group . Mirroring the common  healthcare 247 
practice,  participants’ readiness to progress from one stage to the other was not assessed , but 248 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  11 
instead participants were taught techniques that allowed them to move between the stages , for 249 
example , in cases of relapse.   250 
During preparation and action stages  (week s 8 - 26) participants were supported in 251 
development of new behaviours, while  at the maintenance  stage  (weeks 26 - 156) the 252 
emphasis was on forming the newly developed behaviours into habits . Habit formation was 253 
supported by enhancing self -regulatory mechanisms such as skills to prevent and manage 254 
relapses  that could be incorporated  into everyday life (for further details see Kahlert et al., 255 
2016) .  256

Participant recruitment  258 
Participants were recruited from eight study sites: Copenhagen, Denmark; Helsinki, 259 
Finland; Nottingham, United Kingdom; Maastricht, The Netherlands; Navarra, Spain; Sofia, 260 
Bulgaria; Auckland, New Zealand ; and Sydney, Australia. Men and women with BMI ≥ 261 
25kg/m2, who were  aged 25 to 70 years  were eligi ble for participation . Pre-diabetes was 262 
confirmed following t he American Diabetes Association criteria with an oral glucose 263 
tolerance test (OGTT) (American Diabetes Association, 2011) . Participant s we recruited  by 264 
advertising  in print and visual media, and b y direct contact with  primary and occupational 265 
health care providers . The relevant Human Ethics  Committees approved the study protocol  266 
for each study site . Each participant  provide a written informed consent (Fogelholm et al., 267 
2017) .  268 
Data collection  269 
Anthropometric (e.g. body weight and height), metabolic (e.g. HbA 1c), demographic 270 
(e.g. sex, age) and social-cognitive  variables (e.g.  habit -strength ) were collected  at weeks 26, 271 
52, 104, 156  of the PREVIEW RCT  (see Figure 1) . Attendance frequency to PREMIT was 272 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  12 
assessed from week 8. All measurements  of social-cognitive  variables were collected using  273 
standardi sed questionnaires , which , for non -English speaking countries , were translated into 274 
local languages. Using standard practice, the accuracy  of the  questionnaire  translations was 275 
checked by back -translati ons.  276 
Outcome measurements  277 
Height  and body w eight.  Height was measured at the screening visit in meters.   278 
Weight measured in light clothes at week 26, week 52, week 104, week 156.  279 
Demographic characteristics .  European Social Survey and International Social 280 
Survey (ESS, 2 015). 281 
Habit -strength for an energy -dense  diet.  The questionnaire included 6 items, 3 for 282 
eating high-fat or high calorie foods , and 3 for snacking between meals  (based on Ji & Wood, 283 
2007; Wood, Tam, & Guerrero Witt, 2005) . The q uestions asked  abou t behavioural frequency 284 
and stability  of context  over the past few week s with maximum score of 343 reflecting strong 285 
habit -strength for  high fat/ high calori c food. Cronbach ’s Alpha s were calculated separately 286 
for each time point  ranging from α = .79 to α = .80, indicating  satisfactory scale reliabilit ies. 287 
Self-regulation of motivation  – diet. The Treatment Self -Regulation Questionnaire 288 
(Levesque et al., 2007)  with 15 items  was used to  measure four dimensions of motivation : 289 
autonomous  i.e., inherent satisfaction of a behaviour ; introjected  i.e., valuing a behaviour as a 290 
mean to reach an important goal ; extrinsic  i.e., a behaviour as a mean to gain e.g. reward or 291 
approval from others;  amotivation  i.e., behaviour perceived as irrelevant (R. Ryan & Deci, 292 
2000) . The scale had  the maximum score  of 7, indicating  strong tendency towards the 293 
particular self -regulatory style. Amotivation  was not included in the analyses . Cronbach’s 294 
Alphas were calculated separately for each time point and ranged from α = .82 to α = .93.  295 
Diet temptations . Temptations for energy -dense  food were measured with a 7-item 296 
scale abutted  to the “Temptation to not Exercise Scale - subscale of competing demands ” 297 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  13 
with maximum score of 5 indicating strong temptations  (Hausenblas et al., 2001) . Cronbach’s 298 
Alphas were calculated separately for each time point ranging from α = .88 to α = .90, 299 
indicating  satisfactory scale reliabilit ies. 300 
Resisting  energy -dense  diet temptations.  Participants were asked about the ease of 301 
following a healthy diet  as recommended in PREVIEW  in different situations  with maximum 302 
score of 5 reflecting lower resistance to temptations . The questionnaire was  abutted  to the 303 
“Influences o n Physica l Activity Instrument ” (Donahue et al., 2006)  and “Temptations for an 304 
Unhealthy Diet ” (Hausenblas et al., 2001) . Cronbach’s Alphas were calculated separately for 305 
each time point ranging from α = .84 to α = .87, indicating satisfactory scale reliability.   306 
With data at week 26, a principal components analysis with varimax -rotation  was 307 
calculated . A two -factor solution emerged. Five of the items (passing a fast -food restaurant / 308 
a hard day / other eat fatty or sweet food / looking in the shops at sweet or fat ty food / fatty 309 
and sweet food is available) loaded on factor “1” (Eigenvalue  = 2.98) explaining 42.5% of 310 
the variance ( factor  label: “ accessing energy -dense food ”). Two of the items (eating out / 311 
celebrating) loaded on factor “2” (Eigenvalue  = 1.78) expla ining 25. 4% of the variance 312 
(factor  label:  “consuming energy -dense food ”). The two -factor solution explained 67. 9% of 313 
the total variance. A confirmatory factor analysis with the data at week 52 affirmed the two - 314 
factor solution.  315 
Statistical methods  316 
Analyses were based on 962 participants who compl eted the PREVIEW RCT . For the 317 
moderation analysis, f requency of PREMIT  attendance was calculated from the start of 318 
PREMIT  action stage  (week 8 ). The last visit, i.e. , PREMIT wrap -up session 18 (see figure 319 
1), was not included , leaving 13 sessions . Participants were retrospectively divided into three 320 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  14 
groups : (1) infrequent  (0 - 6 sessions  attended , n = 228) , (2) frequent  (7 – 10 sessions  321 
attended , n = 449), and (3) very frequent  (11 – 13 sessions  attended , n = 285) attenders.  322 
Weight -change percentage was calculated for the whole PREMIT maintenance stage 323 
as (Weight_ Week156  – Weight_ Week26 )/Weight_ Week 26) *100. BMI was calculated as 324 
BMI  = kg/m2. For cognitive variables  missing data w ere imputed . Sensitivity analyses with 325 
the original dataset  were conducted . No extreme outliers were removed. Significant 326 
deviations  from normality were found  for habit -strength  and autonomous motivation . Data 327 
transformation s improve d normal distribution  only for autonomous motivation . Due to 328 
multiple testing and violations  of the normal distribution , all statistical tests  were  considered 329 
significant at the level of p ≤ .0 08 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2014) .  330 
Mixed Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) examine d interaction s and 331 
main effects between cognitive variables  over time as within participants variable s, and 332 
frequency of PREMIT attendance  as between participants variable  with Type IV model and 333

timepoint as well as within participant p airwise comparisons  between weeks 26 and 52  (early 336 
maintenance stage) , weeks 52 and 104  (middle maintenance  stage) , and weeks 104 and 152  337 
(late maintenance  stage) . Linear multiple regression  was used to  evaluate the association 338 
between weight -change percentage from  week 26 to 156 (dependent variable ) and cognitive 339 
variables  at week 156 (as predictor variables ). ANOVA was used to compare weight change 340 
percentage at week 156 between groups (PREMIT attendance frequency).  341 
All analyses were completed using SPSS® v27 statistical program. Apart from ω2, 342 
Cramer’s  V, and  η2p, effect size s (dRepeated  Measures , dCohen) were calculated  using Lenhard and 343

temptations  (MDiff = .1, p ≤ .001, dRepeated Measures = .2, small effect) increased significantly , 369 
while r esisting energy -dense food temptations decreased significantly (MDiff = -.1, p ≤ .008, 370

but effect size indicated no real changes ( MDiff = -.02, p ≤ .001, dRepeated Measures = .0, no effect) . 372 
No significant changes were observed for introjected (MDiff = .1, p > .008 ) or external 373

Pairwise comparisons “time” – middle PREMIT maintenance stage (weeks 54 - 104) 375 
Both habit strength (MDiff = 5.8, p ≤ .00 8, dRepeated Measures = .1, no effect ) temptations 376 
(MDiff = .1, p ≤ .008, d Repeated Measures = .0, no effect)  for unhealthy diet showed statistically 377 
significant changes, but effect size indicated no real changes . No significant changes were 378 
observed for resisting energy dense food temptations ( MDiff = -.0, p > .008) , or autonomous 379 
(MDiff = -.0, p > .008) , introjected ( MDiff = .1, p > .008) , and external ( MDiff = .1, p > .008)  380

Pairwise comparisons “time” – late PREMIT maintenance stage (weeks 104 - 156) 382 
No significant change s were observed  for habit strength (MDiff = 3.5, p > .008), and 383 
temptations ( MDiff = .0, p ≥ .008)  or resisting temptations ( MDiff = .0, p > .008)  for energy 384

Association s of habit-strength , motivation,  and temptation s with weight -change  387 
 Multiple linear regression with weight -change percentage during the PREMIT 388 
adherence stage  (week s 26 to 156) as the dependent variable indicated that habit  strength , 389 
motivation,  and temptations at  week 156  were significantly associated ( F(3, 953)  = 22.3, p ≤ 390 
.008, R2 = .07 / R2adj = .06, small effect) . However, of the independent  variables, only  habit- 391 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  17 
strength was found to be  significant ly associated with  the weight -change (β = .1)  with higher 392 
habit -strength associated with higher weight -change , i.e. higher weight re-gain (see Table 2).  393 
TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE  394 
PREMIT attendance and weight re -gain 395 
 Significant effect was found between  PREMIT attendance frequency and weight re - 396 
gain (FWelch (2, 524)  = 8.7, p < .008, ω2 = .02, small effect) . Post-hoc comparisons with 397 
Games -Howell correction indicated that very frequent attenders re -gained significantly less 398 
weight than frequent attenders (MDiff = –2.0, p ≤ .008, dCohen = .3, small effect) . No significant 399 
difference was found  either  between very freque nt and infrequent attenders (MDiff = –.5, p > 400 
.008)  or between frequent and infrequent attenders (MDiff = 1.5, p > .008) . 401 
Discussion  402 
The main  focus in these  analys es was to examine  theor y-driven  assumptions of  403 
associations between intervention  attendance, habit -strength  for energy -dense  food, 404 
motivation to eat healthy diet,  and temptation s for fatty and sweetened  food during the 405 
maintenance  stage of  PREMIT  behaviour modification intervention . The results conformed 406 
the hypothes es only partially . Against expectations, only main effect  for “time” was found , 407 
without main effect for “PREMIT group attendance ” or interaction between “time” and 408 
“attendance frequency ”. However, at the end of the PREVIEW trial (week 156), more 409 
frequent PREMIT attendance was associated with lower weight  re-gain. Results regarding 410 
participant characteristics were similar with previous literature (e.g. Diabetes Prevention 411 
Program (DPP) Research Group, 2002)  with older participants more likely to attend . 412 
Unexpectedly , habit-strength and temptations for energy -dense  food increased  – not 413 
decreased  – while  ability to  resist  temptations decreased – not increased  - during  the early  414 
PREMIT  maintenance stage (weeks 26 - 52) stage . Furthermor e, instead of increasing 415 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  18 
autonomous or introjected motivation, no changes were observed.  At the middle and the late 416 
maintenance  stage s, no further changes in cognitive variables were observed. Therefore,  as 417 
expected , after the early maintenance  stage the self-reported habit -strength (Lally et al., 418 
2010) , temptations , and resisting  temptations  plateau ed (Appelhans et al., 2016; Lin et al., 419 
2016). For motivation,  expected decrease in  introjected or external motivation was not 420 
observed  during middle and late adherence stages  (R. Ryan & Deci, 2000; Richard Ryan et 421 
al., 2008) .  422 
As with the behavioural components of the DPP and AHEAD trials (Diabetes 423 
Prevention Program (DPP) Research Group, 2002; The Look AHEAD Research Group,  424 
2006) , PREMIT  support ed development of new  habits  (Kahlert et al., 2016) . Despite 425 
expectations that frequent participation at group sessions would equip participants to cope 426 
better with the challenges of weight loss maintenance , more frequent attendance was not 427 
associated with more favourable outcomes  in social -cognitive variables,  but was  associated 428 
with lower weight re -gain. Although  only compared to frequent attenders . Further, at the at 429 
the end of the PREVIEW weight maintenance phase, only higher habit -strength for energy - 430 
dense  food was individually associated with  greater weight re -gain.  431 
Habits have been shown to protect from temptations especially in situations of 432 
reduced cognitive control (Appelhans et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016). As expected (Gardner et 433 
al., 2012; Lally et al., 2010) , habit -strength platea ued during middle and late PREMIT  434 
maintenance  stage s, when the new diet behaviours were expected to be embedded  as habits , 435 
but only after habit -strength for an energy -dense  diet unexpected ly increase d during the early 436 
maintenance  stage.  Unexpected increase  in habit -strength  after rapid  weight -loss (Phase I in 437 
PREVIEW  RCT ) was observed previously (Huttunen -lenz et al., 2019) , when participants 438 
reported very low habit -strength for energy -dense  food, but after starting to adapt to a 439 
“healthy ” diet habit -strength increased  again . However , as in th e current  study , on average, 440 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  19 
habit -strength remained on a low level . Therefore, the observed  small  increase s in habit - 441 
strength  could reflect  initial  challenges in adapting to  new behaviours  before formation of  442 
autonomous  habits  (Gardner et al., 2012) .  443 
The ability to resist temptations to an energy -dense  diet has been suggested as one of 444 
the key factors  in maintaining new behaviours and thus  weight loss maintenance (Hausenblas 445 
et al., 2001) . The unexpected increase in temptations and decrease in ability to resist  446 
temptations during the early adherence  period before plateauing as expected (Appelhans et 447 
al., 2016; Hausenblas et al., 2001) . As PREMIT  deploy ed techniques  to enable participants to 448 
resist temptations and reinforce habit formation  (Bandura, 1996; Michie et al., 2008; Renner 449 
& Schwarzer, 2005; Richard Ryan et al., 2008) , current results may reflect  cognitive burden  450 
to maintain new dietary behaviour s in everyday life  when surrounded with potential 451 
temptations to eat unhealthy food s before habits are imbedded  (Gardner et al., 2012) .    452 
Increased autonomous motivation for healthy eating should help in weight 453 
maintenance as healthy eating behaviours are performed due their intrinsic value (e.g. 454 
enjoyment), not because aiming to reach e.g. personally important goal such as weight 455 
maintenance  (introjected  motivation) or external rewards  such as approval of others  (extrinsic 456 
motivation) (R. Ryan & Deci, 2000; Richard Ryan et al., 2008) . While acknowledging that 457 
participants were likely to be  highly motivated, it was unexpected no changes in any of the 458 
motivation variables could be observed. Overall, participants reported  very high autonomous 459 
motivation, which may have led very little room for improvements , i.e. ceiling effect . Values 460 
for introjected and external motivation were lower, but showed no changes. While indicating 461 
that participants  weight maintenance  behaviours were predominantly motivated by their 462 
intrinsic value , motivational style  was nevertheless not associated with weight re -gain. It is 463 
possible that participants not only committing but completing a 36 -months intervention are 464 
very motivated , thus not necessarily reflecting general population.    465 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  20 
While results indicated that habit strength is positively associated with weight 466 
maintenance (Hausenblas et al., 2001; Verhoeven et al., 2012) , it was less clear how PREMIT 467 
contributed to weight maintenance, especially as frequent – but not infrequent - attenders had 468 
the highest weight re -gain. Similarly, to the AHEAD and DPP studies (Diabetes Prevention 469 
Program (DPP) Research Group, 2002; The Look AHEAD Research Group, 2006) , PREMIT 470 
attendance appeared to be associated with weight loss maintenance. But, it was unclear 471 
through which pathways the effects might have been caused, as the results were not in line 472 
with the theoretical assumptions. As the purpose in here was not to test the predictions of a 473 
specific behaviour modification theory , the results here should not be taken as  support or 474 
rebuttal of a specific theory. Together with previous results (Huttunen -Lenz et al., 2019) , it 475 
appears that changes in behavioural determinants (i.e., social -cognitive vari ables) and their 476 
association with weight change does not strictly follow theoretical assumption, at least among 477 
highly motivated participants.  It might well be possible, that very frequent attenders gained 478 
the most benefits from the PREMIT group sessions,  while infrequent attenders may have felt 479 
less need for support and thus attended less frequently. But this conclusion remains 480 
speculative to assume.  481 
There is evidence, that interventions using health behaviour theories are more 482 
effective than those lacki ng a theoretical basis. Nevertheless, a lesson learned here is, that it 483 
might be effective to adapt a theory -based behaviour change strategy to a given natural 484 
environmental, instead of following a theory -based regimen strictly. In an RCT those 485 
adaptations  are not welcome, but in real life they might be. The challenge is to translate 486 
science into practice without losing sight of the specific circumstances (Tabak et al., 2017) .   487 
This study  had a number of limitations. The cut-off points , separating the attendance 488 
groups , could be criticised  as artificial. While a stringent p-value was used to protect against 489 
type I errors, results should nevertheless be interpreted with caution due to deviations  from 490 
HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND WEIGHT LO SS MAINTENANCE  21 
data normality. The analyses also concentrated o n the maintenance  stage  of PREMIT  491 
intervention  and included a limited number of variables associated with behaviour 492 
modification  and maintenance . However, r egardless of the limitations, this study offered 493 
insights into  behavioural  mechanisms and complementary behaviour change technique s of 494 
complex healthcare intervention  over two - and half -year weight maintenance  stage. Although 495 
the observed effect -sizes in this study tended to be small, the combined results contributed to 496 
testing theoretical assumptions of cognitive processes involved in formation of new diet 497 
habits during the behavioural maintenance  stage in a real -life setting. Further, small effect 498 
sizes were likely a reflection of the multifactorial nature of behaviour change  over a long - 499 
lasting time period . In conclusion , habit -strength emerg ed as an important determinant of 500 
successful maintenance of weight -loss.  501 
Conclusions  502 
Behaviour change is a complex task or “wicked problem”. In this study, many of the 503 
hypotheses, especially those postulating specific directions of the changes in social -cognitive 504 
variables were not met. When expected to enter the behavioural maintenance st age of 505 
PREMIT, participants appeared to struggle with some aspects of the behavioural maintenance 506 
before the new behaviours appeared to stabilise. In these analyses, h abit strength appeared as 507 
the key variable , so that  lower habit -strength for  energy -dense food (fatty and sweetened)  at 508 
the end of the weight maintenance stage was associated with lower weight  re-gain. This 509 
reinforces the notion that developing new habits can be effective in protecting  against  weight 510 
re-gain (Gardner et al., 2012) . In addition, the study contributed to understanding 511 
mechanisms of complex theory -based interventions (Craig et al., 2008) .   512
