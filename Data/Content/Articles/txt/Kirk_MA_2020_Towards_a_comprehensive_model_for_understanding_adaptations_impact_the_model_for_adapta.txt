understanding adaptations ’impact: the
model for adaptation design and impact
(MADI)

Abstract
Background: Implementation science is shifting from qualifying adaptations as good or bad towards
understanding adaptations and their impact. Existing adaptation classification frameworks are largely descriptive
(e.g., who made the adaptation) and geared towards researchers. They do not help practitioners in decision-making
around adaptations (e.g., is an adaptation likely to have negative impacts? Should it be pursued?). Moreover, they
lack constructs to consider “ripple effects ”of adaptations (i.e., both intended and unintended impacts on outcomes,
recognizing that an adaptation designed to have a positive impact on one outcome may have unintended impacts
on other outcomes). Finally, they do not specify relationships between adaptations and outcomes, including
mediating and moderating relationships. The objective of our research was to promote systematic assessment of
intended and unintended impacts of adaptations by using existing frameworks to create a model that proposes
relationships among constructs.
Materials and methods: We reviewed, consolidated, and refined constructs from two adaptation frameworks and
one intervention-implementation outcome framework. Using the consolidated and refined constructs, we coded
qualitative descriptions of 14 adaptations made to an existing evidence-based intervention; the 14 adaptations
were designed in prior research by a stakeholder panel using a modified Delphi approach. Each of the 14
adaptations had detailed descriptions, including the nature of the adaptation, who made it, and its goal and
reason. Using coded data, we arranged constructs from existing frameworks into a model, the Model for
Adaptation Design and Impact (MADI), that identifies adaptation characteristics, their intended and unintended
impacts (i.e., ripple effects), and potential mediators and moderators of adaptations ’impact on outcomes. We also
developed a decision aid and website ( MADIguide.org ) to help implementation scientists apply MADI in their work.

Results and conclusions: Our model and associated decision aids build on existing frameworks by
comprehensively characterizing adaptations, proposing how adaptations impact outcomes, and offering practical
guidance for designing adaptations. MADI encourages researchers to think about potential causal pathways of
adaptations (e.g., mediators and moderators) and adaptations ’intended and unintended impacts on outcomes.
MADI encourages practitioners to design adaptations in a way that anticipates intended and unintended impacts
and leverages best practice from research.
Keywords: Adaptation, Evidence-based intervention, Implementation outcomes
Background
Adaptations, or changes made to programs or interven-
tions to align them with the context in which they are
implemented [ 1,4–6], are a reality in implementation.
Adaptations allow for flexibility in implementation, im-
proving the fit of an intervention with a new
organization, population, or context. Adaptation is
multi-faceted and dynamic; for a single intervention, sev-
eral adaptations might be made. Adaptations can be
made to interventions (i.e., the seven P ’s—programs,
practices, principles, procedures, products, pills, and pol-
icies [ 7]) and/or to the implementation strategies
employed to facilitate the implementation of interven-
tions. Moreover, a single adaptation may affect multiple
outcomes, in both intended and unintended ways. For
example, an adaptation intended to increase feasibility
may have unintended “ripple effects, ”such as decreasing
fidelity or appropriateness.
The complex and multi-faceted nature of adaptations
makes theories, models, and frameworks crucial to pro-
mote systematic, consistent adaptation descriptions and
assessments. Although frameworks for adaptation exist
and provide structure for classifying adaptations, they donot propose interrelationships among constructs or ex-
planations of potential causal pathways like models and
theories do [ 11]. The lack of models and theories hin-
ders researchers from the prospective, predictive think-
ing needed to systematically test proposed relationships
among constructs. The limitations of extant theories,
models, and frameworks and lack of explanations of ad-
aptations ’influence on outcomes are not surprising
given that research on adaptation is still relatively young;
only in recent years has the conversation shifted from fi-
delity versus adaptation (two opposing concepts) to bal-
ancing fidelity and adaptation (two complementary
concepts) [ 4,12–19].
One of the most comprehensive and most recently up-
dated adaptation classification frameworks is the Frame-
work for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-
Enhanced (FRAME) by Stirman and colleagues [ 2],
which helps implementation scientists consistently de-
scribe the many facets of adaptations. FRAME is an up-
dated version of Stirman et al. ’s original framework [ 8]
and includes additional considerations like (1) reason for
adaptation (e.g., cultural/religious norms, time con-
straints, access to resources), (2) goal of the adaptation
(e.g., increase reach, retention, feasibility, improve fit),
(3) whether the adaptation was proactive or reactive (i.e.,
made proactively through a planning process that identi-
fies ways to maximize fit and implementation success or
made reactively during the course of program imple-
mentation, often due to unanticipated obstacles and in
an impromptu manner), and (4) the adaptation ’s rela-
tionship to core functions (i.e., whether the adaptation
preserved fidelity to core functions of the original
intervention).
Determining adaptations ’impact on outcomes repre-
sents a high priority objective in research [ 2]. However,
FRAME does not distinguish among adaptations ’impact
on implementation outcomes versus adaptations ’impact
on service or patient outcomes [ 3], and because it mea-
sures goals for adaptation rather than actual outcomes,
it does not distinguish between adaptations ’intended
and unintended impacts (i.e., ripple effects). Similarly,
process models for adaptation (e.g., [ 10,35]) allow for it-
erative cycles that consider and measure outcomes, butContributions to the literature
/C15Adaptation is a reality in implementation; implementers
must adapt interventions to their context to improve
intervention-context fit.
/C15Although frameworks exist for describing adaptations, they
do not outline potential causal pathways, nor do they
acknowledge the “ripple effects ”adaptations can have (both
intended and unintended impacts on outcomes).
/C15This paper contributes to the gaps in the literature by
helping researchers and practitioners answer important
questions around adaptation design (Should I do it? What
outcomes might it impact, intended or unintended? How
can I mitigate potential negative impacts?) and
measurement (Which outcomes are likely to be impacted?
What might causal pathways look like?).Kirk et al. Implementation Science           (2020) 15:56 Page 2 of 15
they do not explicitly consider unintended impacts. Spe-
cifying and measuring a single intended goal of adapta-
tion might not detect ripple effects of adaptations. We
argue that systematic consideration of all potential im-
pacts on a range of implementation and intervention
outcomes is critical to adaptation.
The objective of our research was to (1) integrate out-
comes into existing frameworks to promote a systematic
assessment of adaptations ’intended and unintended im-
pact on outcomes (i.e., ripple effects of adaptations), and
(2) use existing frameworks to create an explanatory
model that proposes possible interrelationships among
constructs. By developing a model using existing frame-
works to outline potential independent variables, media-
tors, moderators, and specific outcomes, we can move
beyond the mere description of adaptations. In practice,
this model can help practitioners think through adapta-
tions ’influence on a range of outcomes to anticipate the
intended and unintended impacts of adaptations. In re-
search, this model can facilitate the systematic investiga-
tion of relationships between constructs —which
characteristics of adaptations are predictive of which
outcomes, under what circumstances, and why.
Methods
To develop our model, we selected three frameworks
from the literature: two adaptation frameworks [ 1,2]
and one outcome framework [ 3]. We selected FRAME
[2] as the basis of our model because it is the most com-
prehensive and most recently updated adaptation classi-
fication framework. We selected Moore et al. and
Proctor et al. ’s work to meet our other two objectives:
integrating implementation and intervention outcomes
(addressed by Proctor et al.) and laying the foundation
for investigating causal pathways between adaptation
and outcomes (addressed by Moore et al. ’s research
which included explanations of adaptation characteris-
tics’relationship to outcomes, suggesting potential
causal pathways) [ 1,3].
AK, SB, and JM reviewed each framework for overlap-
ping constructs/redundancies. We found substantial
overlap between Moore et al. ’s[1] constructs and
FRAME [ 2]. With overlapping constructs identified, we
then assessed, based on our own work adapting
evidence-based practices and programs, whether any of
the constructs should be consolidated or modified in
any way. We made modifications to four constructs. See
Table 1.
The first construct we modified was FRAME ’s“were
adaptations planned? ”(which overlapped with Moore ’s
construct of timing). The literature [ 1,2,13,14,18]
often uses the terms “planned ”and “proactive ”(as well
as unplanned and reactive) synonymously. In defining
these terms, literature [ 1,2,13,14,18] unwittinglysuggests an inextricable link between the impetus for the
adaptation (i.e., whether the adaptation was proactive,
meaning the adaptation was made in response to an an-
ticipated obstacle, or whether the adaptation was react-
ive, meaning the adaptation was made in response to an
unanticipated obstacle) and the process of adaptation
(i.e., how systematic or unsystematic the process was).
Literature [ 1,2,13,14,18] then implies that unplanned/
reactive adaptations are more likely to be made using a
haphazard process and thus more likely to detract from
intervention core functions, resulting in negative impacts
on outcomes. This conflation obfuscates the fact that re-
active adaptations may still be made in a systematic way
and proactive adaptations can be unsystematic. To ac-
knowledge the diverse combinations of adaptation char-
acteristics, we reconceptualized adaptations in terms of
the degree to which they are systematic/unsystematic
and proactive/reactive, removing the notion of planned/
unplanned. This allows us to characterize, at the ex-
tremes of these continuous constructs, adaptations as
follows:
/C15Systematic and proactive: made using a formal
process that includes consulting data, theory, best
p r a c t i c e ,a n d / o rs t a k e h o l d e r sa sw e l la s
considering the impact on outcomes (systematic),
due to an anticipated obstacle/challenge
(proactive). Examples of systematic, proactive
adaptations could include those made using a
formal process, prior to implementation (during
planning/preparation/installation) [ 22,23], due to
anticipated areas of misfit between the
intervention and context.
/C15Systematic and reactive: made using a formal
process that includes consulting data, theory, best
practice, and/or stakeholders as well as considering
the impact on outcomes (systematic), due to an
unanticipated obstacle/challenge (reactive). Examples
of systematic and reactive adaptations could include
those brought to light after implementation has begun
via a quality improvement or Plan-Due-Study-Act
cycle, but using a systematic process, or those made
during program delivery by providers/practitioners in
response to an unanticipated obstacle, but still using a
systematic process.
/C15Unsystematic and proactive: made without a formal
process (unsystematic), due to an anticipated
obstacle (proactive). Examples of unsystematic,
proactive adaptations may include those made at the
individual level by a provider/practitioner prior to
program delivery to address an anticipated barrier,
such as patient literacy or language, but without
consulting data/theory/stakeholders or considering
the impact on outcomes.Kirk et al. Implementation Science           (2020) 15:56 Page 3 of 15

distinction is important as the assumption is that reactive
adaptations are more likely to be non-systematic, impromptu,

intervention. However, our conceptualization allows for an
understanding that reactive adaptations can still be made in a

/C15Unsystematic and reactive: made without a formal
process (unsystematic), due to an unanticipated
obstacle (reactive). Examples of unsystematic,
reactive adaptations could include those made by a
practitioner/provider improvising during delivery
because of an unanticipated obstacle, but without
consulting data/theory/stakeholders or considering
the impact on outcomes.
Second, we modified FRAME ’s construct of “relation-
ship to core elements/fidelity? ”(or valence in Moore ’s
framework) by removing reference to “core elements ”
and instead focusing solely on “relationship to core func-
tions. ”Recent publications [ 20,21] argue for use of the
term “core functions ”and “forms ”of interventions ra-
ther than previously used terminology of core compo-
nents, core elements, and/or active ingredients [ 4,13,
16,17,24–31]. This nomenclature emphasizes that it is
the functions that intervention components serve that
are“core, ”not the exact form that they take, as it is pos-
sible to have several different forms that serve the same
function. This modification is largely one of nomencla-
ture, not a change in the meaning of the construct.
Third, we added potential goals of adaptation based on
the literature [ 3] and our experience engaging in adapta-
tion in the field. Several of our additions overlap with
Proctor ’s eight implementation outcomes as we often
see in practice that implementers make adaptations to
improve sustainability, fidelity, or other implementation
outcomes. We also added “no goal ”; this response option
might apply to cases of unsystematic, reactive adapta-
tions where the change was made without the goal of
improving an outcome. Additional goals for adaptation
included the following:
/C15Improve fidelity: to improve adherence, dose, or
quality of intervention use (e.g., adding session
checklists as reminders to improve adherence to
protocols, adaptations to timing or mode of session
to improve dose, and additional trainings,
supervision, or coaching to improve quality).
/C15Improve sustainability: to improve maintenance or
institutionalization of the intervention. Whereas
adaptations to improve feasibility may increase
initial/early intervention use, adaptations to improve
sustainability may increase the intervention ’s long-
term use. For example, an intervention may be
adapted to be delivered by existing staff to test initial
feasibility and outcomes of the adapted intervention;
over time, continuing to deliver the intervention
along with regular duties may be deemed unsustain-
able for existing staff. Thus, the organization may
later decide to further adapt the intervention to be
delivered by newly hired staff, whose primary dutiesinclude intervention delivery. The initial adaptation
was to improve feasibility; the second adaptation
was made to improve sustainability. Timing of adap-
tations for feasibility vs sustainability may be driven
by contextual factors; organizations that choose to
adopt an intervention may adapt for initial feasibility
early-on and re-adapt for sustainability after evaluat-
ing initial outcomes. Organizations that are man-
dated to adopt interventions may adapt for
sustainability early-on as they know continuing the
use of the intervention is required.
/C15Improve likelihood of adoption: to increase the
likelihood that an intervention will be used at all.
This is contrasted with adaptations that are made
to improve feasibility or sustainability once the
decision has been made to adopt the intervention.
For example, an intervention that cannot be
adapted to be used with an organization ’sc u r r e n t
electronic health record system may be a “non-
starter ”given the cost of a new electronic health
record system. Adaptations to make the
intervention compatible with the current
electronic health record system are intended to
improve adoption, not necessarily feasibility or
sustainability.
/C15No goal: No intent. Whereas adaptations to improve
acceptability are made to improve the perception
that the intervention is agreeable, palatable, or
satisfactory [ 3], those made with no goal would
include those where there was no intent behind the
adaptation (e.g., provider forgot a component or ran
out of time). In these instances, the modification to
the intervention was not intentional and had no
specific goal in mind.
When considering the goal of the adaptation, an adapta-
tion may have multiple intended goals. Thus, we encour-
age implementation scientists to consider the primary
intention behind the adaptation and select multiple re-
sponses as needed, knowing that adaptations and the in-
tent behind them may evolve as organizations and
practitioners move through the phases of implementation.
Fourth, intervention outcomes include direct effects of
the intervention itself. To account for this, we combined
Proctor ’s client and service outcomes into the broad
construct “intervention outcomes. ”
After reviewing constructs for redundancies and modi-
fying construct definitions, we then used the revised
constructs to develop our model. To develop our model,
three authors (SB, AK, JM) coded 14 adaptations to an
existing evidence-based intervention to improve the
timeliness of referrals to hospice [ 34]. The evidence-
based intervention was originally developed and tested
in a randomized controlled trial to improve theKirk et al. Implementation Science           (2020) 15:56 Page 7 of 15
timeliness of referrals to hospice for nursing home resi-
dents [ 34]. As part of a prior research effort [ 32], mem-
bers of our research team (SB, AK) adapted the
intervention from use in nursing home settings to use in
home health settings. To design the adaptations, we en-
gaged an expert panel comprised of 4 home health and
hospice practitioners and used a modified Delphi ap-
proach where the expert panel reviewed the original
intervention protocol and came to consensus on adapta-
tions that would be needed to deliver the intervention in
the new setting (home health). The stakeholder panel
identified a total of 14 adaptations; major adaptations in-
cluded changing eligibility criteria to make the interven-
tion more appropriate for home health patients and
multiple changes to delivery of the intervention to make
the intervention more feasible to deliver as part of rou-
tine care (e.g., adapting who delivered the intervention,
when, and how). From the modified Delphi discussions,
we had rich descriptive data for each of the 14 adapta-
tions, including who made the adaptation, descriptions
of the adaptation, and the reason and intended goal of
the adaptation. We used this descriptive data of each of
the 14 adaptations and coded the data using the con-
structs from Table 1. Coding included structured re-
sponses (e.g., selecting what the nature of an adaptation
was) as well as unstructured responses (reasons why we
thought an adaptation might impact a certain outcome,
and expected direction of the effect). SB, AK, and JM in-
dependently coded all 14 adaptations; afterwards, we
met as a group to discuss and reconcile any discordantcoding selections and how we might re-arrange con-
structs into domains to propose causal pathways of ad-
aptations ’impact.
Results
Our revised model, the Model for Adaptation Design
and Impact (MADI), is presented in Fig. 1. MADI is or-
ganized into three domains (adaptation characteristics,
possible mediating or moderating factors, and outcomes)
and is designed for prospective use (i.e., during the
process of deciding on and designing adaptations) and/
or retrospective use (i.e., when adaptations are being im-
plemented and evaluated).
Domain 1: adaptation characteristics
Constructs in domain 1 include (1) what was modified,
(2) the nature of the adaptation, (3) who participated in
adaptation decision-making, (4) for whom/what the
adaptation was made, and (5) when the adaptation oc-
curred. These constructs help implementers classify
adaptation attributes, providing an architecture that pro-
motes consistency in reporting and comparison of find-
ings across studies, which will help elucidate whether
patterns emerge across studies. Constructs in domain 1
can be applied to adaptations made to interventions (i.e.,
the seven P ’s—programs, practices, principles, proce-
dures, products, pills, and policies [ 7]) or implementa-
tion strategies.

Domain 2: possible mediating or moderating factors
Domain 2 comprises possible mediators or moderators
of adaptation characteristics ’impact on outcomes, which
we have categorized as such largely based on the find-
ings of Moore et al. ’s research. Moore et al. found that
adaptations that were made systematically/proactively,
were aligned with core functions, and were made to im-
prove fit (i.e., had a stated goal/reason beyond logistics
such as time or convenience) were more likely to incur
positive impacts on outcomes [ 1]. Specifically, Moore
et al. ’s research showed that when adaptations were
made with the goal of improving fit (e.g., to align the
intervention with values of the target population), they
were more likely to have a positive impact. Moore et al.
also found that when adaptations were aligned with core
functions of the intervention/the intervention ’s theory of
change, they were more likely to have a positive impact.
This notion is supported by other literature that recom-
mends all adaptations align with an intervention ’s core
functions [ 4,10,13,16,17,24–29,31,33]. Finally,
Moore found that adaptations that were made pro-
actively were more likely to have a positive impact and
more likely to be made with the goal of improving fit.
Thus, we believe Moore ’s research presents initial em-
pirical evidence that these constructs (goal of adaptation;
whether adaptation was systematic; whether adaptation
was proactive; whether adaptation aligned with core
functions of intervention/implementation strategy) could
be important moderators (as they can reverse, enhance,
or diminish the impact on outcomes) and/or mediators
(as some explain why an adaptation had certain impacts
on outcomes). Although we believe the research is still
too scant to say definitively which constructs are moder-
ators and which are mediators and what interrelation-
ships may exist, we suggest the following propositions
that can be empirically tested in future research. First,
we propose that alignment with core functions is a po-
tential mediator of adaptations ’impact on outcomes be-
cause it preserves the mechanisms of change inherent to
the intervention (or implementation strategy, depending
on what is being adapted), thus preserving the link be-
tween intervention and outcome. We suspect the con-
structs of systematic, proactive, and goal of adaptation as
potential moderators because they are aspects of the
adaptation design and decision-making process that
break or reverse the relationship between intervention
and outcome, through relationship to core functions. Re-
active adaptations are more likely to be made using an
unsystematic process; an unsystematic process that does
not consult theory, empirical data, or best practice, or
anticipate impacts on outcomes, may compromise core
functions. Similarly, adaptations with no stated goal may
be less likely to have considered alignment with core
functions, thus making the adaptation more likely tocompromise outcomes. In short, we believe these con-
structs point to conditions under which adaptations (ei-
ther to the intervention or implementation strategy) are
more likely to have positive impacts on outcomes. Fi-
nally, the stated goal of the adaptation may also possibly
be related to moderators of the original intervention it-
self. For example, an adaptation may be made due to pa-
tient motivation or comorbidity —these reasons for the
adaptation may also be moderators of the intervention
outcomes.
Domain 3: implementation and intervention outcomes
(intended and unintended)
We are ultimately interested in how adaptations impact
both implementation and intervention outcomes. Thus,
we included in domain 3 a range of possible implemen-
tation and intervention outcomes that adaptations could
impact. In addition, we conceptualized outcomes in do-
main 3 as both intended and unintended outcomes be-
cause we know in practice that adaptations may have
ripple effects from implementation to intervention out-
comes (e.g., improved acceptability may diminish inter-
vention effectiveness if the adaptation compromises core
functions). Thus, when applying constructs in domain 3,
we encourage implementers to consider both intended
and unintended impacts.
Prospective use of MADI
We designed our model to be applied prospectively
(during the process of deciding which adaptations to
make) to avoid unintended impacts and/or retrospect-
ively (after adaptations have been decided upon) to
evaluate impacts of adaptations. Prospectively, our
framework can guide decision-making around the design
of adaptations and whether an adaptation should be
made, based on potential impacts. See Fig. 2.
When using our model prospectively, we recommend
using constructs in domain 2 as potential criteria in the
decision-making process. Evidence suggests that non-
systematic adaptations, those made without a goal in
mind, and those that compromise core functions are as-
sociated with negative impact on outcomes [ 1]. Rating
each potential adaptation using the four constructs in
domain 2 can guide decision-making about whether to
move forward with an adaptation as currently designed.
If an adaptation is non-systematic, not aligned with core
functions, or made without a clear goal, it may be more
likely to negatively impact outcomes. In these instances,
users should monitor outcomes closely and/or consider
re-designing or abandoning the adaptation [ 35].
The second decision prompts users to consider each
adaptation ’s impact on all outcomes in domain 3, both
intended and unintended. Based on our experience in
practice, we suspect that adaptations may haveKirk et al. Implementation Science           (2020) 15:56 Page 9 of 15
unintended negative impacts in addition to the intended,
positive impact and that, in these instances, there is no a
priori clear answer about the impact of an adaptation.
Despite this, we encourage users to engage in a discus-
sion about the tradeoffs between potential impacts and
use this discussion to help come to a consensus on
whether to move forward with an adaptation, re-design
it, or abandon it. Even if negative impacts are suspected,
positive impacts on other outcomes may help “balance
the scales ”(i.e., even if negative impacts are suspect for
one outcome, positive impacts on another outcome may
result in a net-positive gain) and/or users may be able to
develop implementation strategies to offset potential
negative impacts. For example, if an adaptation designed
to decrease costs is suspected to have an unintended,
negative impact on acceptability, implementers may be
able to “offset ”the unintended negative impacts on ac-
ceptability by including an implementation strategy to
increase buy-in as part of the implementation effort. In
this instance, although an unintended negative impact is
suspected, implementers may decide to move forward
with the adaptation because they feel the implementa-
tion strategy to improve buy-in may be sufficient to
mitigate unintended negative impacts. Although the suc-
cess of this mitigation strategy is not guaranteed, imple-
menters are, at a minimum, aware of the full range of
impacts and actions they are taking to offset unintended
impacts and can closely monitor outcomes during im-
plementation. Thus, although MADI is not a predictivealgorithm supported by empirical evidence, discussions
guided by MADI can hopefully improve the status quo
of making adaptations without considering their full
range of impacts. In short, there may be instances where
implementers decide to move forward with adaptations,
despite anticipating negative, unintended impacts. This
could happen for any number of reasons (e.g., legislative
or funding requirements, leadership decisions). What-
ever the reason for moving forward with an adaptation,
engaging in thoughtful discussion with stakeholders
about ripple effects can help implementers plan better
for implementation (e.g., design implementation strat-
egies to mitigate any negative impacts, anticipate out-
comes that should be monitored in evaluation),
hopefully increasing the likelihood of net-positive
outcomes.
We recommend users document discussions sur-
rounding decisions 1 and 2 to help guide the develop-
ment of research questions and selection of variables to
monitor in evaluation or other research efforts. We note
that prospective application may be an iterative process,
with a first step to decide whether to adapt the interven-
tion at all or not, a decision point that can be supported
by other decision aids [ 35]. Once researchers or practi-
tioners have made the decision to adapt, our framework
can be applied prospectively to aid in the design of adap-
tations that minimize negative impacts. For example, in
a 2019 study [ 32], we adapted an intervention [ 34] de-
signed to improve the timeliness of referrals to hospice
Fig. 2 Decision-making guide for prospective use of MADIKirk et al. Implementation Science           (2020) 15:56 Page 10 of 15
in nursing homes for implementation in home health.
As part of this effort, we also adapted the intervention
from a randomized controlled trial model (where research
staff delivered the intervention) to a practical model
(where the intervention would be delivered by staff at the
home health agency). As part of this shift, we adapted sev-
eral aspects of the delivery of the intervention. Instead of
research assistants carrying out the main activities of the
intervention, home health staff would deliver the interven-
tion as part of regular care. Although adaptations made to
the delivery of the intervention were designed with the
goal of improving feasibility and adoption, the adaptations
also had the potential to compromise fidelity to the core
functions of the intervention. The potential risk to fidelity
was an unintended impact that we had to weigh against
the potential benefit to feasibility and adoption —did the
adaptations made to improve feasibility and adoption re-
late to core functions of the intervention and thus risk fi-
delity and effectiveness? These potential “ripple effects ”of
our adaptations were discussed and considered proactively
by our research team before deciding whether to move
forward with the adaptations. Because we anticipated po-
tential negative impacts if fidelity were compromised, it
was an outcome we knew we would have to closely moni-
tor when testing the adapted intervention; it was an unin-
tended impact we were aware of and able to monitor in
evaluation [ 32].
Finally, although we encourage practitioners to engage in
adaptation (and apply our model/decision aid) prior to im-
plementation, as early as the planning/preparation/installa-
tion phases [ 22,23], we note that MADI can be applied
throughout implementation an d advocate for continued ap-
plication, as adaptation is an inherently iterative process.
Because adaptations are desi gned to improve the fit of the
intervention with context, adaptation is not a “one and
done ”process as context is continually changing and out-
comes are, ideally, continually monitored to inform im-
provements. The continuous evolution of adaptations as
implementation progresses is increasingly acknowledged in
the literature (e.g., [ 36,37]) and underscores the import-
ance of considering adaptation as an iterative, ongoing
process. Thus, although implementers may initially use
MADI in the planning/design phase to proactively and sys-
tematically design adaptatio ns prior to implementation, we
encourage continuous use of MADI as implementation
progresses and teams monitor impacts on outcomes.Retrospective use of MADI
Users can apply our model as a scaffolding for evaluating
research questions and/or selecting variables and for
testing hypotheses and assumptions about causal path-
ways. See Fig. 3.
If an intervention has already been adapted and re-
searchers aim to evaluate impacts of the adapted inter-
vention, MADI can be used as a discussion guide to help
determine potential mediators/moderators and which
array of outcomes may be impacted by which adapta-
tions. Because adaptations can have ripple effects (i.e.,
both intended and unintended impacts), using our
framework to guide discussion can help ensure that out-
come variables are appropriately selected. For example,
if researchers are designing an evaluation of an adapted
intervention, they should first describe the adaptations
using the constructs from MADI ’s domain 1 (e.g., who
made the adaptation and when, nature of the adapta-
tion). These characteristics of adaptations may be used
as independent variables in evaluation. Second, re-
searchers could then use constructs in domain 3 to con-
sider both the intended and unintended impacts of
adaptations. Traditionally, researchers may choose out-
come variables to measure in an evaluation based on the
intended impact of the adaptation; however, this may re-
sult in a biased selection of outcome variables for re-
search as it only captures a subset of adaptations ’
impacts. Our own practice shows us that adaptations
can have multiple intended and unintended impacts
(ripple effects); thus, researchers may benefit from a ro-
bust discussion of each outcome in domain 3 when
choosing outcome variables to include in evaluation.
Such discussion may allow for more robust analyses that
can capture the intended and unintended impacts of ad-
aptations. Finally, researchers could use constructs in
domain 2 to determine potential mediators and modera-
tors to include in evaluation. By noting whether adapta-
tions align with core functions, were made with an
intended goal, and were systematic and proactive, re-
searchers can assess causal pathways of adaptations.
Discussion
A primary goal in research on adaptation is building the
knowledge base on what types of adaptations impact
which outcomes under which circumstances and why.
Classification frameworks (e.g., [ 1,2]) help us classify
Fig. 3 Retrospective application of MADIKirk et al. Implementation Science           (2020) 15:56 Page 11 of 15
adaptations but do not integrate outcomes, nor do they
specify interrelationships or potential causal pathways
among constructs. Similarly, other reviews [ 9]i n v e s t i g a t e
adaptations, reasons, and outcomes, but do not posit rela-
tionships among constructs. We integrated and updated
three existing frameworks by turning these frameworks
into a model, MADI, which outlines possible interrelation-
ships for how adaptations influence outcomes.
Components of MADI
MADI elaborates on FRAME and other frameworks in
two ways. First, FRAME alluded to outcomes (the goal
construct states the intent of the adaptation, which im-
plicates outcomes). MADI compels users to consider
how adaptations may influence all outcomes listed in
our outcome domain and whether those outcomes are
intended or unintended; we have found in practice that
adaptations often have unintended ripple effects on mul-
tiple outcomes, even if they were designed with the in-
tent of having a positive impact on one outcome in
particular. Second, MADI arranges constructs from
FRAME and other frameworks into an explanatory
model that shows possible interrelationships for how ad-
aptations influence outcome as MADI elucidates poten-
tial mediating and moderating relationships for how
adaptations influence outcomes. In this sense, MADI ad-
vances the field by moving from a framework (a struc-
ture or overview of descriptive categories that does not
provide explanations [ 11]) to an explanatory model that
proposes explanations of potential mediating and mod-
erating relationships underlying adaptations ’impact on
outcomes.
How MADI advances implementation science
Our model builds on the existing literature and moves
the adaptation literature base forward in several ways.
First, unlike other models which simply categorize adap-
tations (e.g., FRAME), aid in the decision of whether to
adapt at all (e.g., [ 35]), or provide guidance on the
process of adaptation (e.g., [ 5,38]), our model aids in
the design of adaptations and adaptation-related re-
search questions, emphasizing the intended and unin-
tended consequences that adaptations can have, helping
practitioners minimize negative impacts, and helping re-
searchers systematically evaluate them. We hope that
MADI and the accompanying decision aid will encour-
age practitioners to think about adaptation early and en-
gage in a systematic decision-making process and that it
will encourage ongoing adaptation design conversations
throughout the implementation lifecycle.
Second, MADI directs attention to potential impacts and
ripple effects in the adaptation decision-making process.
This contrasts with current lit erature, which encourages fo-
cusing on whether core functions are compromised as theprimary (and often singular) criterion for designing poten-
tial adaptations. We argue that, to achieve desired out-
comes, in addition to assessing alignment with core
functions, potential adaptations must avoid compromising
implementation. Indeed, adapt ations are often proposed to
facilitate positive impacts on implementation outcomes.
Adaptations that are made to improve one implementation
outcome (e.g., acceptability) may compromise another im-
plementation outcome (e.g., f easibility), which may, in turn,
compromise the intervention ’s overall impact.
Finally, we believe that MADI will help implementa-
tion researchers build and investigate research questions
using a common taxonomy, which will more quickly
move the field towards an empirically validated middle-
range theory of adaptation, as it will allow for common
nomenclature across studies. We hope researchers will
use domains from MADI and select constructs to build
specific theories of change for their interventions and
adaptations. In this sense, although MADI is a model be-
cause it highlights potential interrelationships, it can be
used like a framework to guide research as it provides a
“menu of constructs ”for researchers to select from when
building potential causal pathways that can then be em-
pirically tested through research. MADI will provide re-
searchers a consistent, systematic way to select and
describe potential mediators, moderators, and outcomes
for research studies, which we hope facilitates the testing
of mechanisms of change underlying adaptations to de-
velop empirically valid theories of change. The next
steps are to test hypotheses and pathways, with the goal
of developing a theory of change related to adaptations.
To promote dialogue in the field, we have developed a
website for MADI ( MADIguide.org ). We envision this
website being a hub for MADI and housing several re-
sources available to implementation scientists. Specific-
ally, we have developed a comprehensive MADI
Application and Discussion guide, which is available on
the MADIguide.org website. This guide walks re-
searchers and practitioners through applying MADI in
their work and includes step-by-step instructions and
discussion questions, as well as examples of how MADI
has been applied already in research. We encourage im-
plementation scientists to visit the MADIguide.org web-
site to access the MADI Application and Discussion
guide and other resources.
Limitations and scope of MADI
Our model has several limitations. First, although it is
evidence-informed (i.e., builds on existing, widely ac-
cepted and adopted frameworks) and was constructed
using a systematic process (i.e., the coding of adaptation
data), it has not been empirically tested. This means that
although we suspect constructs in domain 2 may be im-
portant mediators or moderators, we have notKirk et al. Implementation Science           (2020) 15:56 Page 12 of 15
empirically tested this model to validate these relation-
ships. Moreover, we have not tested whether the out-
comes in domain 3 are the most common or most
important outcomes likely to be impacted by adaptation.
Despite this, we believe that our model is unique in its
comprehensive nature and, as such, represents an im-
portant step forward for developing and testing theories
of adaptation.
Although we believe MADI adds value to the field, we
also acknowledge MADI ’s limited scope in comparison
with the larger adaptation process. MADI is not
intended to be an adaptation process framework (i.e., a
framework that outlines step-by-step instructions for the
full lifecycle of the adaptation process [ 10]), as it does
not cover all steps in the adaptation process. For ex-
ample, once an intervention has been selected, adapta-
tion is a process that generally consists of (1)
understanding the intervention (identifying its core func-
tions and forms; reviewing related materials, such as
protocols or manuals); (2) identifying and consulting
with experts and stakeholders throughout the adaptation
process to better understand the new setting where the
adapted intervention will be implemented and consult-
ing with original intervention developers as needed to
seek advice on adaptation; (3) identifying differences be-
tween the context the intervention was designed for and
the new context, which will inform potential areas of
misfit; (4) identifying aspects of the original intervention
that need to be adapted; (5) designing and specifying ad-
aptations; (6) conducting any feasibility testing of the
adapted intervention (pre-testing/pilot testing and mak-
ing further adaptations if necessary); (7) training staff on
the adapted intervention; (8) implementing the adapted
intervention; and (9) evaluating the impact of the
adapted intervention [ 10].
In practice, MADI is most applicable in step 5, design-
ing adaptations. As such, MADI assumes that implemen-
ters have already completed several important preceding
steps in the adaptation process, including identifying core
functions (underlying principles that make the interven-
tion effective and, thus, should not be adapted [ 21]) and
forms of the intervention, identifying and consulting with
relevant stakeholders and experts, identifying context dif-
ferences, and deciding what needs to be adapted. In re-
search, MADI is helpful in step 9, designing the evaluation
of an adapted intervention. When applied in research,
MADI assumes that prior steps in the adaptation process
have been completed according to best practice, including
identifying core functions and forms of the intervention,
consulting stakeholders and experts, and clearly specifying
all characteristics of adaptations.
Whether applying MADI in research or practice, if
preceding steps in the adaptation process have not been
completed, we recommend implementation scientistsintegrate other approaches or frameworks into their ef-
forts to ensure these steps are completed before applying
MADI. In particular, we underscore the importance of
identifying core functions and forms of existing inter-
ventions before engaging in any adaptation efforts. For
further guidance on identifying core functions and
forms, a key step in the adaptation process to preserve
the effectiveness of the original intervention, we recom-
mend reviewing [ 20,21]. In addition, for implementation
scientists adapting an existing intervention, it may be
helpful to pair MADI with an existing adaptation
process framework to promote a systematic, comprehen-
sive, evidence-informed approach to adaptation. We rec-
ommend the scoping review by Escoffery et al. [ 10] for a
comprehensive listing of adaptation process frameworks
for adapting public health interventions.
Conclusion
Future research is needed to test our model and confirm
mediating and moderating relationships, as well as im-
pacts on outcomes. In addition, more applied work is
needed to assess the relevance and feasibility of using
MADI to aid in decision-making around adaptation de-
sign. Finally, although we acknowledge that adaptations
can be made to interventions or implementation strat-
egies, our model does not discern different mediating/
moderating pathways and different impacts on outcomes
based on what is being adapted (implementation strategy
or intervention). More research and application of
MADI is needed to determine whether there are differ-
ent pathways to outcomes based on what is being
adapted (i.e., intervention or implementation strategy).
We hope MADI can serve as a springboard for promot-
ing systematic discussion among adaptation decision-
makers and provide scaffolding for building the
evidence-base around mechanisms of change underlying
adaptations.
