Abstract
Background: Male condoms are effective in preventing common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
unintended pregnancy, if used correctly and consistently. However, condom use errors and problems are common
and young people report negative experiences, such as reduced pleasure. The Kinsey Institute Home-Based
Exercises for Responsible Sex (KIHERS) is a novel condom promotion intervention for young women, which aims to
reduce condom errors and problems, increase self-efficacy and improve attitudes towards condoms, using a
pleasure-focussed approach. The study objective was to test the operability, viability and acceptability of an
adapted version of the KIHERS intervention with young women aged 16 –25 years in the United Kingdom (UK)
(Home-Based Exercises for Responsible Sex-UK (HERS-UK).
Methods: A repeated-measures single-arm design was used, with a baseline (T1) and two follow-up assessments
(T2 and T3), conducted 4 weeks and 8 weeks post intervention over a 3-month period. Participants were provided a
condom kit containing different condoms and lubricants and were asked to experiment with condoms alone using
a dildo and/or with a sexual partner. Ten process evaluation interviews were conducted post intervention.
Results: Fifty-five young women received the intervention; 36 (65%) completed T2 and 33 (60%) completed T3.
Condom use errors and problems decreased, self-efficacy increased and attitudes towards condoms improved
significantly. The proportion of participants who reported using a condom for intercourse in the past 4 weeks
increased from T1 (20; 47%) to T2 (27; 87%) and T3 (23; 77%) and using lubricant with a condom for intercourse
increased from T1 (6; 30%) to T2 (13; 48%)) and T3 (16; 70%). However, motivation to use condoms did not change.
Cronbach ’s alpha scores indicated good internal consistency of measures used. Qualitative data provided strong
evidence for the acceptability of the intervention.

Conclusions: HERS-UK was implemented as intended and the recruitment strategy was successful within a college/
university setting. This feasibility study provided an early indication of the potential effectiveness and acceptability
of the intervention, and the benefits of using a pleasure-focussed approach with young women. Measures used
captured change in outcome variables and were deemed fit for purpose. Future research should explore cost-
effectiveness of this intervention, in a large-scale controlled trial using a diverse sample and targeting young
women most at risk of STIs.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15This is the first feasibility study conducted of the
Home-based Exercises for Responsible Sex (HERS-UK)
intervention to promote correct and consistent condom
use among young women aged 16 –25 years in the UK.
/C15Key findings included strong evidence for the
acceptability of the intervention to young women,
the viability of recruitment methods and outcomes
measures used, and initial evidence that the
intervention might change attitudes towards
condoms and increase condom-related skills and
self-efficacy.
/C15The findings suggest that a larger scale randomised
controlled trial of HERS could be conducted with
few, if any, adaptations required.
Background
Sexually transmitted infecti ons (STI) are a serious public
health problem and have been increasing in recent years.
Public Health England (PHE) reported almost half a million
diagnoses of STIs in 2019, a 5% increase from 2018, the
most common being chlamydia and gonorrhoea, although
diagnoses of syphilis have also increased [ 1]. In fact, in
young women, diagnoses of both gonorrhoea and syphilis
increased by 31%. Young people aged 15 –24 years are at
higher risk of contracting STIs due to more frequent
changes of partner [ 1]. Compared with young men, young
women face more serious complications from STIs, such as
pelvic inflammatory disease, which can increase the risk for
ectopic pregnancy and infertility [ 2]. Young women are also
at risk of unplanned pregnancies and a large-scale survey in
the UK found approximately 45% of pregnancies were un-
planned in women aged 16-19 years [ 3].
Male condoms can be highly protective against the
transmission of STIs [ 4], but incorrect and/or inconsist-
ent condom use with new or casual sex partners is an
important factor underlying the prevalence of STIs
among young people [ 5]. However, almost half of young
people did not use a condom when having sex with a
new partner [ 6]. PHE launched a campaign in 2017 to
reduce rates of STIs in young people, by raising aware-
ness of the potentially serious consequences of STIs and
normalising condom use [ 6].The protection condoms provide against STIs is also
reduced when they are not used from the start to the
finish of sex (termed ‘incomplete use ’), which is more
likely to occur among couples who experience problems
whilst using condoms or dislike using them [ 7,8]. Nega-
tive attitudes and problems with ‘fit and feel ’can stop
young people from using condoms [ 9,10]. Sexual health
interventions which have tried to increase condom use
by focusing on improving men ’s condom use skills and
knowledge have had only limited success [ 11].
More recently, interventions to improve effective con-
dom use have promoted pleasure and fun when using
condoms and lubricants [ 12,13]. The Kinsey Institute
Homework Intervention Strategy® (KIHIS) is a brief be-
haviour change, condom promotion intervention devel-
oped to improve condom skills, self-efficacy and
enjoyment in young men. The impetus for behaviour
change comes from encouraging solitary practice of using
condoms in a ‘no pressure ’situation (without a partner)
with different brands and sizes of condoms, and focussing
on pleasurable sensations whilst experimenting. Evidence
for initial effectiveness has been demonstrated in two pilot
studies (one involving heterosexual men and one involving
men who have sex with men) conducted in the USA and
Canada. These studies reported a reduction in condom
problems and improved self-efficacy, skills and experi-
ences when using condoms [ 12,13].
The KIHIS was adapted for use in the UK (HIS-UK),
and a feasibility trial was recently completed [ 14]. Young
men were provided with a face-to-face training session
on how to apply a condom correctly and a variety of
condoms and lubricants to experiment with at home.
The aim was to find a condom that was right for them,
and increase their focus on pleasurable sensations —
thereby challenging beliefs that condoms reduce pleas-
ure. The intervention was well-received by both young
men and health care professionals, and results from
post-intervention questionnaires indicated that there
was an increase in lubricant use, reduction in errors and
problems, and increased motivation to use condoms.
Barriers to condom use in young women
Although under-researched compared with men ’s expe-
riences, women also report problems and dissatisfactionKnights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 2 of 16
with condoms, such as discomfort, dryness and reduced
sensation [ 15,16]. In addition, women often apply con-
doms to their male partners and report errors and prob-
lems when doing so [ 15]. Educating men on how to
apply condoms correctly and how to make condom use
more pleasurable is an important public health strategy.
However, very few interventions to date have focussed
on this approach with women. Interventions have tended
to focus more on gender power dynamics, such as con-
dom negotiation skills [ 17], and have targeted subgroups
of women who are at high risk for contracting human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/STIs such as sex workers
and African American women [ 18,19].
The affective attitude that condoms reduce sexual
pleasure and enjoyment, and provoke disgust or dislike,
is associated with condom non-use for men and women
[10,20–22]. In fact, studies have found that both men
and women report unprotected sex as being more pleas-
urable [ 10]. Sexual pleasure is an important consider-
ation for women when choosing a contraceptive method
[16–19] and barrier methods that interfere with the en-
joyment of sex are less likely to be appealing.
Condoms can not only reduce sensation and pleasure
and cause vaginal irritation for women, but can also
interfere with perceived closeness to a partner and prove
to be an interruption to sex or ‘spoil the mood ’[23–27].
In addition, condoms can cause arousal loss and inter-
fere with orgasm, resulting in their discontinuation [ 28,
29] and the smell of latex can be a ‘turn off ’for some
women [ 16]. Therefore, it is just as important for
women as for men that they have the opportunity to find
a condom that they can enjoy using, so safe sex can also
be pleasurable sex [ 29].
There is evidence to suggest that interventions incorporat-
ing a pleasure-focussed appro ach, such as those that encour-
age positive associations with condoms, are more effective in
improving attitudes and incre asing condom use than those
that focus on instilling fea r and accentuating risk [ 30–34].
There has also been a move to include pleasure as part of
sex education to enhance the relevance for young people, es-
pecially women, whose pleasur e has been largely ignored and
to challenge the view that safety and pleasure are mutually
exclusive [ 35–37].
Women also apply condoms to their male partners and
are just as likely as men to make errors and experience prob-
lems when using them [ 38,39], which can affect both their
own and their partners ’experience. Common errors reported
by young women include putting the condom on the wrong
way around, using a condom that had dried out, not using
lubricant, and rushed application, which can cause problems
such as slippage and breakage, erection loss and discomfort
[40]. Experiencing problems that affect sexual experience
may lead to negative attitudes towards condoms and discon-
tinuation. It is therefore important that interventions addresscondom use errors and problems in both men and women
t oi m p r o v et h ec o n d o mu s ee x p e r i e n c e[ 5].
Not only lack of objective skill, but also lack of per-
ceived skill or confidence may be a barrier to young
women using condoms, especially if their partner is un-
sure about how to use condoms correctly. Self-efficacy is
the belief and confidence that one is capable of success-
fully performing a given behaviour [ 41]. Global condom
use self-efficacy (i.e. perceived ability to buy, carry, nego-
tiate and use a condom correctly) and other relevant
self-efficacy dimensions (such as using a condom under
the influence of substances, or when highly aroused) are
associated with intention to use condoms in young
women [ 42] and can predict actual and intended con-
dom use [ 43,44]. However, high condom use self-
efficacy does not always ensure correct and consistent
condom use. For example, an individual may believe that
they are using a condom correctly even if they are mak-
ing consistent errors; therefore, interventions should tar-
get actual condom use skills [ 45].
The KIHIS was adapted for women and the KIHERS
created by the Condom Use Research Team (KI-CURT)
at the Kinsey Institute. The aim of the intervention is to
improve women ’s experience with condoms and their
ability to use condoms and lubricants as part of mutually
pleasurable and safe sexual activity. The intervention in-
corporates core training to increase condom skills and
self-efficacy, with home-based practice using a range of
different condoms and lubricants. Young women are
asked to rate the condoms and lubricants practised with,
on various dimensions, including how pleasurable the
experience was. A recent pilot study of KIHERS in the
USA found that the intervention was acceptable to
young women and that condom use errors and problems
decreased, whilst condom-related attitudes and self-
efficacy improved. Condom experiences were also more
positively rated post intervention [ 46].
Underlying theoretical framework
It is important that behaviour change interventions have
a solid theoretical framework. The KIHERS intervention
incorporated the information-motivation-behavioural
skills (IMB) model, [ 47,48] which is an empirically vali-
dated and comprehensive health behaviour change
framework, developed to reduce sexual risk behaviours.
The model contains three constructs required to affect
behaviour change —information, motivation and behav-
ioural skills. Firstly, providing information helps the in-
dividual decide whether to engage in a particular health
behaviour. Personal motivation involves addressing atti-
tudes that may influence the individual ’s likelihood of
engaging in that behaviour, and social motivation in-
volves increasing social support, i.e. normalisation of the
behaviour within a social group. Finally, behaviouralKnights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 3 of 16
skills include perceived and objective skills as well as
confidence (i.e. self-efficacy) for carrying out the behav-
iour. The IMB model has a sound theoretical basis for
modifying sexual risk behaviour [ 49–52] and interven-
tions using an IMB framework have had a significant im-
pact on changing behaviour in young people [ 53,54].
The objective of the current study was to adapt the
KIHERS into a culturally and health care-appropriate
intervention for delivery to young women (aged 16 –25
years) within community settings in the UK (HERS-UK),
and to test it for viability, operability and acceptability in
readiness for a full trial.
Methods
Design
The research included a consultation and design work
package to refine and finalise the content of HERS-UK.
This phase involved conducting three focus groups and
four individual interviews with young women who pro-
vided feedback and suggestions on all aspects of the
intervention, and input from an advisory group of sexual
health experts who provided further advice and guidance
with regard to the intervention content and delivery. In
addition, a feasibility work package was included to test
recruitment and retention strategies, intervention deliv-
ery and adherence to the protocol, data collection and
assessment procedures, appropriateness of proposed
outcome measures and acceptability of the intervention
to young women.
The feasibility study included intervention delivery and
process evaluation using quantitative questionnaire data
and qualitative interview data. Ethical approval was ob-
tained from the University of Southampton ethics
committee.
For the main feasibility study, a repeated-measures, single-
arm design was used, with participants providing baseline
and two sets of follow-up data via an online survey. Partici-
pants provided baseline data (T1), after which they met with
the researcher to receive the KIHERS core training. Partici-
pants were then given 3 weeks to test and try out a range of
condoms and lubricants and a second survey was adminis-
tered 4 weeks after the end of the testing period. The final
survey (T3) was administered 4 weeks later. Questionnaire
and demographic data were collected using a secure online
platform called Lifeguide which is a University of Southamp-
ton developed tool that has been used extensively in web-
based interventions. The programme incorporated a text/
email messaging service, so participants received reminders
when it was time to complete follow-ups and condom
ratings.
All young women had the opportunity to provide feed-
back about their experience of study participation after
completing T3. Ten young women additionally took part
in process evaluation interviews and were asked abouttheir experiences of the intervention. Interviews were
audio-recorded and transcribed by hand by the first au-
thor. A thematic analysis was conducted by the first au-
thor, using Braun and Clarke ’s methodology [ 55].
Transcripts were coded using an inductive approach,
whereby themes were generated from the data and no
pre-defined coding framework used. Identified themes
were discussed and finalised with the study PI.
Recruitment
The aim was to recruit approximately 50 young women
to take part in the main feasibility study. The initial
strategy was to recruit young women from local youth
organisations, but many of the organisations approached
were overwhelmed with supporting service users with
mental health problems and did not feel they could cur-
rently engage with a sexual health intervention. An
alternative approach of recruiting from colleges and uni-
versities in Hampshire was more successful. The re-
searcher provided an educational session on condom use
and an introduction to the study to students, which was
arranged with either the school nurse or the assistant
head teacher. After the session, young women received a
variety of free condoms and lubes and posters contain-
ing links to the study website, where prospective partici-
pants could download an information sheet and register
for the study. Inclusion criteria were (1) any gender
identity (with attributes of a biological woman, i.e. a va-
gina); (2) aged 16 –25; (3) does not always use a condom
with sexual partners; (4) dislike condoms or experience
problems when using them. Participants were excluded
if they had a penis or a latex allergy.
Over 150 young women registered for the study, and
55 were selected to participate on a first come, first
served basis —participants were contacted in order of
registration and those who responded were booked in
for core training. When the number of participants who
had completed the baseline survey and received core
training reached 55, recruitment was halted. Recruit-
ment began in July 2019 and data collection ended in
January 2020.
Intervention content and delivery
Prior to registration, participants were able to address
any queries or concerns with the researcher before
agreeing to take part. Participants gave online consent
before beginning the survey. Baseline (T1) data com-
prised information on demographics and participants ’
sexual activity and condom use, including the impact of
condoms on sexual experience, errors and problems
when using condoms, attitude towards condoms, and
confidence in using and applying condoms.
Participants were then contacted by the researcher to
arrange a time to meet to receive the core trainingKnights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 4 of 16
session, which lasted approximately 50 min. The inter-
vention was delivered using a motivational interviewing
(MI) approach that can support and enable behaviour
change [ 56] by the first author (who was trained in MI).
MI has been successful in enhancing motivation for be-
haviour change in adolescents and young people with a
range of problems that include addiction and sexual
risk-taking [ 57–59] and has demonstrated effectiveness
as part of brief behaviour change interventions for young
people [ 60,61]. The purpose of the session was to pro-
vide information about condoms and lubricants, with an
emphasis on maximising pleasure and reducing discom-
fort and interruption to improve the sexual experience,
and thereby change attitudes towards condoms. Infor-
mation was provided about condom and lube use within
the context of vaginal, anal and oral sex. Participants
were also informed about different sizes of condoms,
and provided with a size guide (see online supplemen-
tary file ), as many young women in the consultation and
design phase had mentioned that size was a problem for
them and their partners.
The second aim of the core training session was to de-
velop skills in using condoms correctly, thus reducing
errors and problems and increasing self-efficacy, and
positive condom attitudes and experiences. The re-
searcher demonstrated how to apply a condom correctly
using a realistic size dildo, and young women had the
opportunity to practise themselves, and receive feedback.
An instruction and information leaflet was also provided
with instructions on how to apply a condom correctly,
so young women could refer to this when practising at
home. In addition, the leaflet contained information
about different types of condoms and lubes, tips on how
to make condom use more pleasurable, and condom
testing and rating instructions, so participants were clear
about what they were being asked to do. Participants
were also told about novel ways of applying condoms
(such as by mouth) in the session.
Along with the instruction and information leaflet,
participants received a condom kit to take home. The
condom kit was designed with input from the young
women that had contributed to the consultation and de-
sign phase. They provided suggestions for all aspects of
the intervention, including the attributes of the different
condoms, the packaging of the kit, the study logo (see
online supplementary file ), the colour and size of the
dildo (realistic-sized, and pink or purple) and the inclu-
sion of a condom holder, so that condoms could be car-
ried discreetly. Young women had also expressed a
preference for having the option to rate condoms tested,
both alone, and with a partner.
The kit contained 10 different condoms (two of each
type, 20 in total) designed for women ’s pleasure and
comfort, such as textured, flavoured, coloured, extrasensitive, non-latex and coated with stimulating gel. In
addition, a condom designed for women, with a clean
smell and attractive packaging was included, and one
that came in fun, unique packaging. The researcher dis-
cussed the different attributes of each condom with the
participant. In addition, a selection of water and
silicone-based lubes were included and a realistic-sized
dildo (available from https://www.annsummers.com/sex-
toys/sex-toys-dildos/5inch-r ealistic-jelly-dildo/118146.
html ). Each kit contained two of each type of condom
(20 in total), so that young women could experiment
with the condom alone using the dildo, and/or with a
sexual partner.
Follow-up assessments after completion of the core
session
After the session, participants had 3 weeks to experi-
ment with the condoms and lubes at home. After trying
out each individual condom, they were asked to rate
each one on attributes such as smell, texture and pack-
aging and overall, how enjoyable it had been to use, e.g.
‘I liked the texture of the condom material. ’Responses
were scored on a 5-point scale from ‘strongly disagree ’
to‘strongly agree ’. Higher scores indicated a more posi-
tive experience of using a particular condom.
Four weeks after rating the condoms, participants re-
ceived a text/email reminder to complete T2 and then 4
weeks after, the final follow-up (T3). T2 and T3 ques-
tions asked about sexual activity in the previous 4 weeks
and all the same questions as T1, with the exception of
demographic information. After completing T2, partici-
pants received a gift pack of condoms and lubes, which
was either delivered to them at their school/college or
posted discreetly to their home address. After comple-
tion of T3, participants received £25 cash for their time.
The ten participants who completed post-intervention
process interviews received an additional £10.
Outcome measures
The objective of HERS-UK was to improve the sexual
experience of using condoms for young women, address
negative attitudes towards condoms, increase self-
efficacy and skill to use condoms and ultimately, in-
crease motivation to use condoms. Below we describe
the measures used to assess these variables.
Demographic questions
Demographic questions included age, ethnicity, highest
level of qualification, employment status, postcode, sex-
ual orientation, relationship status, number of lifetime
sexual partners and previous condom use (see Table 1
for demographic characteristics of the sample).Knights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 5 of 16
Effect of condoms on sexual experience
The degree to which using a condom affected arousal,
desire, pleasure, orgasm and emotional closeness to part-
ner was measured using items taken from the HERS-US
pilot study [ 13]. A sample item was ‘The last time you
had sex using a condom, to what degree did using a con-
dom impact your arousal? ’Responses were made using a
5-point scale from ‘greatly decreased ’to‘greatly in-
creased ’, with a higher score indicating a more positive
impact. T1 Cronbach ’s alpha was .88.
Condom use errors and problems
The 16-item Condom Use Errors/Problems Survey for
Women (CUES-W) [ 62] assessed common errors and
problems during penile-vaginal and penile-anal sex when
using a condom. A sample item was ‘The last time you
had sex, the condom broke. ’Responses were ‘yes’,‘no’or
‘don’tk n o w ’. An additional item was included that asked
the participant if she had applied the condom to her sex-
ual partner and if so, she was asked if she had applied it
the right way around, squeezed the air out, and left a
space at the tip. The total CUES-W score was the num-
ber of errors and problems reported.
Condom attitudes
Condom attitudes were measured using 13 items: 7 from
the Effect on Sexual Experiences subscale of the Con-
dom Barriers Scale (CBS) [ 63]. A sample item was ‘con-
doms don ’t feel good ’. An additional 6 items were
included with a more positive slant, e.g. ‘condoms canmake sex more pleasurable ’, adapted from the Pleasure
Associated with Condoms subscale of the Multidimen-
sional Condom Attitudes Scale (MCAS) [ 64]. Responses
were scored using a 5-point scale from ‘strongly agree ’
to‘strongly disagree ’, with negatively slanted items re-
verse scored. A higher score indicated a more positive
attitude towards condoms. T1 Cronbach ’s alpha was .84.
Condom use self-efficacy
Subscales of the Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale
(CUSES) [ 65] were used that included Mechanics and
Intoxicants, with a total of 16 items. Self-efficacy for ne-
gotiation was not included. CUSES includes items relat-
ing to self-efficacy for technical skills in using a condom,
e.g. ‘I feel confident in my ability to use a condom cor-
rectly ’; for minimizing disruption to the sexual experi-
ence, e.g. ‘I feel confident that I could apply a condom
to my partner without breaking the mood ’; when pur-
chasing and carrying condoms, e.g. ‘I feel confident that
I could purchase condoms without feeling embarrassed ’
and when using substances, e.g. ‘I feel confident that I
would remember to use a condom even after I have been
drinking. ’Responses were scored on a 5-point scale from
‘strongly disagree ’to‘strongly agree ’, with negative items
reverse scored. A higher score indicated greater self-
efficacy. T1 Cronbach ’s alpha was .91.
Reasons for using/not using condoms
Participants were provided with statements as to why
they had or had not used a condom, e.g. ‘dislike using
them ’and could tick as many as were applicable.
Motivation to use condoms
At the end of T1, T2 and T3, participants were asked to
respond to the statement ‘I really want to use condoms
with my partner. ’Responses were scored on a 5-point
scale from ‘strongly agree ’to‘strongly disagree ’. A higher
score indicated higher motivation.
Process evaluation questions
A subgroup of ten participants were asked about their
experience of taking part in the intervention in a one-to-
one face-to-face interview. Process interview questions
covered the following topics: motivation for taking part
in the study; previous experience of condoms; their ex-
periences taking part in the study, including the intro-
ductory session with the researchers, rating the
condoms, using the website, and completing the ques-
tionnaires, and what they thought about the kits.

similar numbers of participants. Women who partici-
pated in the design and consultation phases were offered
the opportunity to participate in the main feasibility
study but only a small number did and the majority of
participants were recruited from organizations and
colleges.
Quantitative data analysis
IBM SPSS Statistics 26 was used for all analyses. The ob-
jective of a feasibility study is primarily to test the ac-
ceptability of measures, but changes in scores across
time points can indicate that measures are appropriate
to capture any impact of an intervention, in readiness
for a full trial. The inter-item reliability of the scale mea-
sures administered at baseline was tested, using Cron-
bach ’s alpha. Binary logistic regression was used to
predict the odds of dropping out of the study (yes/no)
based on deprivation and level of education (GCSE/A
Level or above). These two variables were chosen based
on findings from a feasibility study on the HIS-UK inter-
vention that these variables were related to the likeli-
hood of study completion and compliance [ 14].
Deprivation was quantified by dichotomising categories
of deprivation into ‘most ’and ‘least ’deprived, using the
English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (2019) [ 66]. Out-
come measures using questionnaire scores were com-
pared across T1 (baseline) and T2 and T3 (post
intervention) using the repeated-measures analysis func-
tion within the General Linear Model. Post hoc paired
sample ttests were used if the overall model was signifi-
cant. If violation of sphericity was present, then a
Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied and a non-
parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test used for post hoc
analysis. A priori predictions were that any significant
change in outcome variables was likely to occur between
T1 and T2, with change being maintained at T3.
Results
Participants
All 55 participants were between the ages of 16 and 25
(M18.40 years, SD 2.6) and the majority were students.
Most participants lived in areas of higher socioeconomic
status in line with the English Indices of Multiple
Deprivation (2019) [ 66]. The number of lifetime sexual
partners ranged from 1 to 50, with three being the me-
dian number reported. The lifetime prevalence of chla-
mydia diagnosis was 7.3 % ( N= 4).
Participants were able to provide open text responses
about their motivation to take part in the study. Re-
sponses were categorised as follows (from the most to
least frequent): (1) how to make sex with a condom
more pleasurable; (2) the opportunity to try out a variety
of condoms and lubes; (3) to learn more about how to
use condoms, and reduce problems such as splitting anddryness; (4) interest in and desire to gain more confi-
dence generally with regard to female sexual health and
pleasure; (5) to find an alternative method of contracep-
tion to hormonal methods.
Condom ratings and adherence
Of the 55 participants who received the intervention,
73% ( N= 40) went on to rate condoms. For each con-
dom, participants had the opportunity to complete 20
ratings: 10 alone and 10 with a partner. The average
number of ratings was 7.5 (range 1 –16); 15 (38%) partic-
ipants were fully adherent, rating all 10 condoms. More
ratings were done with a partner ( N= 189; 62%) vs.
alone ( N= 114; 38%) and the dildo was used in the ma-
jority of ‘alone ’ratings 103 (90%) vs. 11 (10%). Lubricant
was used in a third of ratings (29%, N= 87) and 65
(75%) of participants who used lubricant reported that it
increased pleasure. The mean time to complete ratings
was 12.5 min (SD 9.1). The most highly rated condoms
were the brand designed for women, with a clean smell
and attractive packaging, the studded design with fun,
uniquely designed packaging and the non-latex brand.
The coloured and flavoured condoms received the low-
est ratings, although young women said that flavoured
condoms could make oral sex more fun.
Retention
After rating the condoms, 36 women (65%) completed
T2 and 33 (60%) completed T3 (see Fig. 1). A logistic re-
gression analysis predicted the likelihood of dropout
based on the level of qualification and deprivation. The
overall model was significant X2(2) = 12.74, p= .002.
Residing in areas of least deprivation ( p= .05) and
higher level of education ( p= .009) significantly in-
creased the odds of completing the study.
Outcome assessment
Participants were asked why they had or had not used a
condom when having sexual intercourse with a partner
at T1, T2 and T3 in the past 4 weeks; they could tick as
many reasons as applicable (see Table 2). The propor-
tion of participants who reported using a condom for
intercourse in the past 4 weeks increased from T1 (20;
47%) to T2 (27; 87%) and T3 (23; 77%) and using lubri-
cant with a condom for intercourse increased from T1
(6; 30%) to T2 (13; 48%) and T3 (16; 70%).
Participants who had used a condom in the past 4
weeks were asked at T1, T2 and T3 about errors and
problems (CUES-W) (see Tables 3and4) and effects on
sexual experience, using items from the HERS-US pilot
study, which asked about the perceived impact of using
a condom on desire, arousal, pleasure, closeness and or-
gasm. The most common errors at T1 were not check-
ing the expiry date and not checking for damage, andKnights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 7 of 16
the most common problems were discomfort and prob-
lems fitting the partner. There was an overall decrease in
reported errors and problems from T1 ( M6, SD 3.20) to
T2 ( M2.7, SD 1.8), t(13) = 3.28; p= .006, 95% CI [2.5-
5], but no further significant reduction at T3 ( M2.7, SD
2.1). There was no significant change in the reported ef-
fect of condoms on sexual experience across time
points.
All participants were asked about their attitude to-
wards condoms (using items from the CBS/MCAS) andself-efficacy for condom use (CUSES) at each time point.
Attitude improved from T1 ( M31.6, SD 6.1) to T2 ( M
37.6, SD 6.6) Z= 4.3, p< 0.001, 95% CI [34.2 –38.1] but
no further significant change occurred at T3 ( M39.3,
SD 7.1). Self-efficacy increased from T1 ( M52, SD 11.4)
to T2 ( M59.6, SD 8.5) Z = 3.82, p= < 0.001, 95% CI
[54.7 –60.4] but no further significant change occurred at
T3 ( M61.1, SD 7.9). For both those in established rela-
tionships and those with casual partners, motivation to
use condoms did not change.Fig. 1 Summary of participant flow

Process evaluation interviews
The thematic analysis conducted on the ten process evalu-
ation interviews identified s ix themes, described below.
Theme 1: Fun and relaxed vs. clinical and ‘intimidating ’
Young women felt that sexual health interventions could
be intimidating for some, especially if they were too
‘clinical ’or‘in your face ’. However, participants said that
they felt comfortable being part of the HERS-UK Con-
dom Study as it was informal, relaxed and fun. Sexual
health interventions that focussed on condoms and the
risk of STIs and those that were too sexually explicit
were unappealing. Most young women wanted condoms
that had female-friendly packaging and were ‘discreet ’.
The use of language was important to make young
women feel comfortable; for example, the use of the
word ‘exploration ’or‘experimentation ’was preferred as
opposed to ‘masturbation ’. Some young women were
more sexually confident and comfortable using more ex-
plicit words, but still felt that it was better to use neutral
language initially, and see what different individuals felt
comfortable with. One of the aims of the feasibility study
had been to adapt KIHERS for use with young women
in the UK, so making sure the intervention contained
culturally appropriate language was an important
consideration.“Website and logo didn ’t make you nervous to be a
part of the study …it was not too serious, it looked
relaxed and laid back - not intimidating ’….”
“The study was fun …and the packaging not dull
and boring. ”
No significant embarrassment or psychological dis-
comfort was reported, but one participant felt that
care needed to be taken when asking questions about
casual sex, as this might infer judgement. This was
especially relevant for women who traditionally are
encouraged to enjoy sex as part of a loving relation-
ship, with casual sex associated with risk and fear of
contracting STIs.
“I think there should be an option to differentiate be-
tween ‘dating ’sort of casual sex and having casual
sex with someone you've just met. ”
Theme 2: Pleasure and empowerment
Despite the acknowledged sensitivity around women and
sexual pleasure, participants welcomed the emphasis on
female pleasure and being in the study had left some
feeling ‘empowered ’. There was felt to be a stigma
around women enjoying sex and young women sug-
gested that studies such as HERS-UK could help to ad-
dress this. For some, it was the first time that they had
been explicitly asked to focus on, and consider, their
own pleasure.Table 3 Percentage of participants reporting errors at each time point

“It’s quite nice to be asked about your experience, ra-
ther than just how it feels for the man –
empowering ….”
Rating condoms on their own for some women pro-
vided an opportunity to focus on their own bodies and
their own enjoyment and not having to ‘rush ’to accom-
modate their partner ’s‘readiness ’or pleasure. Some
young women had previously talked about the applica-
tion of the condom as signifying the end of foreplay,
which may not have corresponded with when they were
ready to begin intercourse.
“Advantage of rating alone, you could relax and
focus on your own pleasure …take your time ….”
In addition, some young women had found it useful to
try out a condom alone to ‘get to know it ’, which in-
creased their confidence before using it with a casual
partner. It could be intimidating for those who were less
sexually experienced to apply and use a condom with
someone that they did not know that well. Those with
steady partners thought it was a good idea to find a con-
dom that felt good for them, and could enhance sexual
pleasure when using it with their partner.
“Trying out condoms on the dildo is good for girls
with more casual partners, as you don ’t want to get
out a new condom with someone that you don ’t
know anything about. ”
“I enjoyed using the dildo …it gave me a good chance
to engage with the condom before trying it out with
my partner ….”
Theme 3: Not ‘one size fits all ’
What young women said they benefitted from most
about being in the study was the opportunity to try out
a variety of condoms to find one that suited them. Most
were limited by which condoms were available for free,
which was not always suitable; there was a particular
problem cited with size variation. Cost was a significant
barrier to being able to experiment with differentcondoms. For most young women, their experience of
using free condoms had been mainly negative, which
had put them off using condoms altogether.
“They give you Pasante and nothing else …you don ’t
get lube, you have to get that yourself …if you wanted
to try a few different condoms and lubes, it would
cost you about £50 upwards. ”
Ratings provided the opportunity for young women to
explore different attributes of a condom —such as fra-
grance, texture, colour —and focus on what they liked
and what they did not like because it made them evalu-
ate a condom in a way they had never done before.
“The rating forces you to think about the condom in
more depth ….”
“I didn ’t know what was important to me …now I do
–heat transmission and thickness. ”
The pack had included condoms designed to enhance
women ’s pleasure and these had been well received over-
all, but condom preference was still a very personal
thing. For example, some women reported increased
pleasure and sensation when using ribbed and dotted,
but for others, they caused discomfort.
“Very good experience with this condom for me and
my partner. I think the dotted texture heightened
stimulation and made the sex more pleasurable. ”
“I felt that the studs on the condom were too big and
caused a little pain and irritation. ”
Some young women commented that there should
have been more size variation in the pack, as when they
were rating with a partner they encountered problems
with condoms being too tight, or slipping off.
“We tried this condom but unfortunately it was far
too tight that we couldn ’t get it over half way with-
out him being in pain. ”Table 5 Change in outcome measures across T1, T2 and T3

Theme 4: Sharing the experience —physical and emotional
closeness
Although most young women found the dildo useful
and enjoyed using it, there was acknowledgement that it
felt different to a penis. Young women felt it was better
to have the option to rate with both the dildo and a
partner, if possible, to ‘get the best of both worlds ’. For
example, testing with a partner provided a more ‘natural ’
physical sensation. However, it was not just the physical
sensation that was important when rating an experience
with a partner, but the emotional closeness —being able
to share the experience and have fun together.
“I preferred testing condoms with my boyfriend be-
cause of heat transduction …it feels better, more
natural. ”
“I think it ’s good to experience both sides of it if you
can –rating alone and with a partner …I made a lot
of jokes about it with my partner ….”
In addition, for those with regular partners, testing the
condoms together facilitated discussion about what they
both enjoyed when using condoms. For some, these
kinds of conversations had not happened before partici-
pating in the study.
“The best thing was when we laid them all out and
decided what we wanted to try ….I also asked him -
‘what did you think of it? ’–we did talk about it
more. ”
Theme 5: Identifying problems, finding solutions
Prior to completing the intervention, most young
women had accepted condom use problems such as
slippage, breakage, and discomfort as largely unsolv-
able and ‘normal ’— an intrinsic part of using a con-
dom —which is likely to have contributed to
negative attitudes. They discussed problems they had
encountered while using condoms previously, and
how being in the study had helped them to actively
address these. Most felt that the study was very
‘hands-on ’, meaning that they were not just passive
participants, but actively engaging with the kit, and
experimenting with the various condoms and lubes to
improve their experience. For example, dryness had
caused discomfort for many young women, but using
lubes had alleviated some of the discomfort.
“With the lubes, it ’s much more helpful, because
whereas before we couldn ’t finish …now we can. ”
“I mixed together the water and silicone lube to get
the right consistency. ”For some young women, condoms had been an inter-
ruption to sex, but learning how to apply them skilfully
had improved this to some degree; experimenting with
different techniques such as mouth application was also
seen as a good thing, as it increased options for those
who felt that condoms spoiled the mood.
“Nice to know how to apply a condom myself, as it ’s
then easier to incorporate it into foreplay …I think
now it ’s less of an interruption than it was ….”
Many young women reported problems with using the
wrong size condoms and some had previously been un-
aware of the different sizes available.
“Trying different sizes helped as I previously strug-
gled with this with my partner and didn ’t know
about the different size options. ”
Theme 6: Functional and fun
Most young women had seen condoms in purely func-
tional terms prior to participating in the study: ‘a neces-
sary evil ’and associated with STIs. Condoms were not
generally associated with fun or pleasure. Certainly, the
sex education that most young women had received had
only talked about condoms in terms of STIs or unin-
tended pregnancy and had done nothing to address their
reputation as ‘pleasure destroyer ’. However, having the
opportunity to experience different colours, shapes, tex-
tures, flavours etc. had challenged this perception. For
some young women, this was the first time that they had
been able to experiment with a variety of condoms.
Some had experimented with ribbed and dotted con-
doms prior to being in the study, but most had been un-
aware of the different sizes and other attributes of
condoms and had never really considered how condoms
might enhance women ’s pleasure.
“Condoms are more fun now …they are not just a
thing to stop getting pregnant ….”
“I definitely learned a lot more about the different
types of condoms and how they can be more pleasur-
able for women. ”
Discussion
Feasibility findings
HERS-UK was implemented as intended and no major
adaptations from the original KIHERS intervention were
required. The intervention was straightforward to de-
liver, and the one-to-one core training session with the
researcher worked well in a variety of locations that
suited participants. All participants received the core
components of the training session: basic instruction onKnights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 11 of 16
how to apply a condom correctly; introduction to the se-
lection of condoms and lubes; discussion with the re-
searcher about their own problems/experiences with
condoms and possible solutions. Sessions were indivi-
dualised to some degree, depending on the experiences
and preferences of individual young women. For ex-
ample, some participants had more experience applying
condoms or a greater degree of discomfort/dislike in
using them, and in these cases, the researcher would
spend more time on these topics.
Using a MI approach to deliver the intervention was
valuable, as this approach emphasises respect, autonomy
and empathy and supports self-efficacy. In addition, be-
havioural change occurs because of its relevance to the
young person ’s own values. An MI approach explores
and addresses ambivalence for change, i.e. ‘I want to use
condoms to protect myself from STIs, but they make sex
less pleasurable ’, which was a common dilemma for
young women in the study. Participants found the op-
portunity to discuss problems they had experienced with
condoms and to receive a ‘menu ’of possible solutions
very useful, in keeping with the MI approach. Reducing
condom use problems, and thus improving the condom
experience, is likely to increase self-efficacy and also im-
prove attitudes. It was clear from the qualitative process
interviews, and talking to young women in the core
training session, that problems with condoms, such as
breakage and discomfort, were viewed as just a normal
part of condom use, and something that had to be ‘put
up with ’, rather than addressed, which is likely to have
contributed to negative attitudes.
Participants reported differing experiences of sex edu-
cation and often had not been taught explicitly about
condom application. Teaching young women how to use
condoms correctly in a relaxed ‘women-only ’setting and
also providing the opportunity to practise alone, with a
dildo, is likely to increase practical skill and self-efficacy.
Young women in our study found that having the op-
portunity to try out individual condoms before using
them with partners was very useful.
Providing detailed information about condoms, espe-
cially with regard to size, was also a good strategy for
improving self-efficacy. Many young women had strug-
gled with condom size issues and had experienced prob-
lems with condoms breaking or slipping off, which had
decreased their confidence and contributed to negative
attitudes. In fact, although overall participants were very
positive about the condom kit, one criticism was that
there was not enough size variation. This is something
that should be addressed in any future trial, especially as
young women are likely to want to experiment with
partners.
Participants engaged very well with HERS-UK and
expressed satisfaction with the text/email reminders anddid not find them intrusive. Most dropouts occurred be-
fore the rating period, which indicates that some young
women may have just wanted to receive the condom kit
and not intended to engage with the study. Dropout
from rating to T3 was low; generally, those who rated
condoms continued with the intervention until T3.
Interestingly, two of the women who dropped out after
rating condoms were both participants with no part-
nered sexual experience, but they had wanted to learn
more about condoms and lubricants before having sex
for the first time. There was evidence to suggest that
dropout was more likely to occur in those living in less
affluent areas, and with lower levels of education. In sub-
sequent studies, it would be worth investing more time
in understanding how the intervention could be adapted
to increase retention rates for those young women.
Nearly three-quarters of those who received the kit
provided condom ratings. In fact, young women engaged
well with the rating component of the intervention, with
an average of 7.5 ratings per participant, and an average
rating time of 12.5 min per practice session. Participants
also wrote thoughtful comments about the condoms
they were rating. Experimentation with condoms and lu-
bricants was acceptable and a fun part of the interven-
tion for most of the participants —both alone and with
a partner. Participants who rated condoms after experi-
menting alone reported that they enjoyed using the
dildo, although the option to rate with a partner was also
important and more ratings were completed with a part-
ner than alone. Some young women preferred the more
‘natural ’feel of trying out condoms with a partner and
some felt that it was more fun to do the intervention
with another person. For those who had regular part-
ners, some enjoyed the experience of choosing a condom
that suited them both.
The rating component of the intervention was import-
ant in that it explicitly focussed attention on the various
attributes of condoms and pleasurable sensations. Nega-
tive attitudes are likely to remain unchallenged if young
women do not have the opportunity to re-evaluate their
experiences and feelings towards condoms. Young
women were also appreciative of the focus on finding
condoms and lubricants that suited them as an individ-
ual, as they had seldom had the opportunity to find a
condom that they were comfortable using. The focus
was usually on finding a condom that suited the male
partner.
Process evaluation interviews provided further support
for the acceptability of HERS-UK; the emphasis on fe-
male pleasure was especially well received. Younger par-
ticipants appeared to be equally comfortable with HERS-
UK as older participants or those with greater sexual ex-
perience. HERS-UK was designed for young women who
are having/or have had sexual intercourse andKnights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 12 of 16
experienced problems with or disliked using condoms
but it seems feasible that it could be adapted for those
who have yet to begin their sexual lives.
Although teachers and staff in colleges/universities
were not interviewed, the intervention appeared to be
acceptable to this group, who supported recruitment
and were keen to receive outside expertise in sexual
health for their students. However, it was more difficult
to recruit from youth organisations, where staff were
dealing with youth with mental health problems and
considered sexual health to be a lower priority. The re-
cruitment strategy worked very well in schools and col-
leges, although this did require a significant investment
of time and building relationships. Over 150 students
registered for the study —most after receiving an intro-
ductory talk and free condoms and lubricant samples.
However, some participants had registered after seeing
the study poster and had not attended a presentation, so
this could be a feasible alternative recruitment strategy.
Providing free samples of different condoms and lubri-
cants is a relatively cost-effective way of engaging and
retaining participants.
Limitations
Some study limitations need to be acknowledged. There
was limited diversity in terms of ethnicity, but this was
more likely a representation of the local population from
where participants were drawn. Further work could be
done on adapting the intervention (if required) for those
young women from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic
backgrounds. For example, in cultures where it is less
acceptable for women to talk about sexual pleasure,
some aspects of the wording in recruitment could be
adapted. There might also be a requirement to add a ne-
gotiation component to the intervention for those young
women from backgrounds where there is a significant
gender power imbalance. In addition, although the study
included bisexual young women, more work could be
done on making HERS-UK accessible and relevant for
individuals with diverse sexual orientation and gender
identities.
Another potential limitation was that participants were
recruited solely from colleges and universities, as it was
not possible to work with local youth organisations who
were dealing with large volumes of mental health issues
in young people. Therefore, those from the most disad-
vantaged backgrounds may not have been adequately
represented in our sample. In fact, there was some evi-
dence to suggest that women from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds were more likely to drop out of the study.
Future research should adopt a targeted approach to ex-
plore the effectiveness of the intervention for young
women at higher risk of STIs.Additional limitations were that we did not assess the
researcher ’s fidelity to the intervention delivered and the
thematic analysis was conducted by only one researcher
(the first author). Although there is evidence for the ini-
tial effectiveness of the intervention with regard to chan-
ging attitudes and increasing skill and self-efficacy,
further work needs to be done to understand how this
translates into actual condom use behaviour, especially
with new or casual partners.
Implications of findings
This feasibility study has demonstrated promising initial
effectiveness and that young women are willing to ex-
periment with condoms and lubes to keep themselves
safe. In terms of cost, variety is the key requirement -
providing young women with a choice of condoms and
sachets of lubricant need not be expensive. In fact, the
top-rated condom was not one of the ‘premium ’brands.
It was rated highly because of the attractive, fun pack-
aging, ease of opening and dots which provided extra
stimulation. The appearance of condom packaging is
something therefore that providers of free condoms to
young women should consider.
Our findings also have implications for sex and rela-
tionships education in that providing a pleasure focussed
approach is likely to be a more effective strategy to en-
gage young women than traditional sex education. In
terms of delivery, there is benefit in engaging external
speakers with specialist knowledge. Again, this need not
incur a high cost, as partnerships with local universities
and colleges could provide this resource. In fact, some
further education colleges had student sexual health am-
bassadors who provided peer-led education with regard
to condom use.
Conclusions
The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of a
novel condom promotion intervention for young
women. The intervention was implemented with no
major adaptations required and the recruitment strategy
proved effective. There was strong evidence for the ac-
ceptability of HERS-UK as young women engaged well
with the intervention. There were no technical issues
with Lifeguide, the web-based platform used for all on-
line entries and text/email reminders were sent as pro-
grammed. HERS-UK is a viable and promising sexual
health intervention for young women and a larger scale
randomised controlled trial should be conducted to
evaluate its effectiveness.
There was initial support for the potential effectiveness
of HERS-UK on key outcomes and measures used were
sensitive enough to capture change in outcome variables.
There was a significant reduction in condom use errors
and problems, improved attitudes and increase in self-Knights et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:145 Page 13 of 16
efficacy for using condoms. The proportion of young
women using condoms and lube for intercourse also in-
creased from T1 to T2, and maintained at T3. However,
motivation for using condoms did not change; assess-
ment of motivation may require a different measurement
approach, instead of asking participants to respond to
one strongly worded statement. The overall mean at all
time points, indicated a ‘neutral ’response to condom
use. Even though attitudes improved, for some young
women, sex would always feel better without condoms
and motivation may be the most resistant to change. In
fact, it is easier to correct condom use errors and prob-
lems —the‘technical ’aspect, than it is to change actual
condom use behaviour, which is why a ‘pleasure focus ’is
so important.
For the majority of participants, the idea that condoms
could be pleasure enhancing, or at least, not interfere,
with sexual pleasure, was not something previously
entertained. The information they had received about
condoms in sex education sessions was very basic and
clinical in the manner provided. Therefore, prior to par-
ticipation in the study, most young women had not re-
ceived any positive messages about condoms, other than
that they protected against STIs and pregnancy. Negative
attitudes are likely to be further entrenched by early
problematic experiences and young women may never
have the opportunity for those attitudes to be
challenged.
The process interviews and open text comments
highlighted the fact that many young women had also
not fully considered their own pleasure and comfort
during sex, being more concerned with their partner ’s
experience. The focus explicitly on female pleasure had
provided the opportunity for young women to take time
out and focus on themselves, which was very welcome,
and is likely to be an effective component of any sexual
health intervention for young women.
Future research needs to assess stakeholders ’perspec-
tives on barriers and facilitators to implementing the
HERS-UK intervention and also assess the crucial issue
of cost-effectiveness of the intervention in a large-scale
controlled trial involving a diverse sample and targeting
young women most at risk of STIs.
