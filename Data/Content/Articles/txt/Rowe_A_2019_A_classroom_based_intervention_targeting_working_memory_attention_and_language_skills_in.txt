A classroom-based intervention targeting
working memory, attention and language
skills in 4 –5 year olds (RECALL): study
protocol for a cluster randomised feasibility
trial
Anita Rowe*, Jill Titterington and Laurence Taggart
Abstract
Background: There is international recognition of the need for creative, classroom-based interventions to support
children at risk of low academic achievement and well-being, due to poor attention and language skills on school
entry. Working memory (WM) is a cognitive skill that is strongly associated with attention and language skills. There
has been speculation that WM training, embedded within typical educational activities, may improve children ’sW M
skills and produce transfer effects to real-world skills such as attention and language. However, little is known about
the effectiveness of this approach.
‘Recall to Enhance Children ’s Attention, Language and Learning ’(RECALL) is a novel, 6-week, classroom-based
intervention targeting WM, attention and language skills in 4 –5 year olds. RECALL was co-produced with health
professionals, teachers and parents. This protocol describes the rationale, methods and analysis plan for a proposed
cluster randomised feasibility trial of this RECALL programme.
Methods: This is a three-arm, cluster randomised feasibility trial comparing RECALL to an existing programme
(active control), and no-intervention (education as usual). We will recruit six schools in socially disadvantaged areas
in one region of the UK. Two schools will be randomly allocated to each arm of the trial. In each school, one class
of children (ages 4-5 years) of approx. 30 children will be involved in this study. Ten children in each class will be
sampled purposefully for outcome measurement including: standardised assessments of WM, language and
attention skills; teacher ratings of attention; and parent ratings of functional communication skills. These will be
administered at baseline and 1-week post-intervention in order to test the acceptability of the measures. A process
evaluation using semi-structured interviews with participants will explore the acceptability of RECALL and the
procedures employed in this trial.
Discussion: This feasibility study will explore the acceptability of RECALL to the health professionals and teachers
who will deliver it and inform the optimal design of the programme. The inclusion of an active control group and
the blinding of outcomes assessors enhance rigour in this study. The findings will determine whether this study can
be scaled-up into a definitive cluster randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness of RECALL.

Background
Internationally, the need for classroom interventions that
break cycles of academic underachievement, unemploy-
ment and poor mental and physical health is widely
acknowledged [ 1]. In areas of low socio-economic status
(LSES), high proportions of children present with impo-
verished language skills on school entry, and are subse-
quently at risk of poor school performance [ 2–4]. To
address this, Speech and Language Therapy and other
health services provide early intervention in schools
through collaborative, classroom-based approaches. How-
ever, there is a lack of research-based evidence for the
effectiveness of such interventions [ 5–7]. There is now a
need for creative, therapeutic interventions to support this
population [ 8,9].
For children from LSES backgrounds, low language is
often associated with cognitive difficulties [ 10,11].
Working memory (WM) is a cognitive skill reflecting
the ability to hold in mind and mentally manipulate
information over short periods of time in the face of
distraction [ 12–14]; it is strongly associated with atten-
tion skills [ 15–17] and language acquisition [ 18]. The
implication of the symbiotic relationship between WM,
attention and language [ 19] is that targeting WM as an
underlying skill may produce improvements in these
real-world skills [ 20].
Most research into the effectiveness of WM interven-
tions has investigated computerised training packages
(e.g. Cogmed 2005 [ 21]). The therapeutic value of this
approach has been debated due to the consistently
inconsistent evidence for transfer effects, i.e. the general-
isation of positive effects on trained tasks to other un-
trained tasks [ 22]. In the WM literature, transfer effects
have been differentiated into near-transfer and far-
transfer. Near-transfer refers to improvements in un-
trained tasks that are similar to those trained, e.g.
improvements in a visuospatial WM task following
training on a verbal WM task [ 23,24]. Far-transfer refers
to enhanced performance in tasks quite different from
those trained but which are deemed to be dependent on
WM, e.g. improvement on real-world skills including
language, literacy, numeracy and the ability to pay
attention in class following WM training [ 23,24]. The
presence of near-transfer effects associated with an
intervention is an essential criterion to corroborate any
far-transfer effects identified [ 25].
On the basis that treatment effects are likely to trans-
fer to activities with overlapping features to the trained
task [ 26], there have been calls for WM training to be
embedded within the typical activities in which benefits
are needed [ 27,28]. However, there has been limited re-
search into the effectiveness of WM interventions
applied with young children in everyday contexts. Fur-
thermore, to date, the literature has focused on thecognitive benefits of WM training, and the individual
differences that may moderate or mediate training and
transfer effects [ 29,30]. There has been little consider-
ation of the contextual factors associated with the deliv-
ery of WM interventions in real-life settings such as
schools. It has been suggested that controlling the qual-
ity, dose and fidelity of WM training in the classroom
setting is challenging [ 29], but there has been a lack of
empirical research into the barriers and facilitators of
implementing WM interventions in schools.
To address this, we have developed the ‘Recall to
Enhance Children ’s Attention Language and Learning ’
(RECALL) programme. RECALL is a theoretically
underpinned, evidence-based intervention that targets
WM, attention and language skills in 4 –5-year-old chil-
dren through group and whole-class activities over a 6-
week period. It is designed to be delivered by teachers
and teams of health professionals that are commissioned
to reduce barriers to learning in one region of the
United Kingdom (UK), Northern Ireland [ 31]. The
Regional Integrated Support for Education (RISE) teams
include speech and language therapists (SLTs), occupa-
tional therapists (OTs), physiotherapists (PTs) and social,
emotional and behavioural specialists (SEBs). They sup-
port children aged between 3 and 8 years (nursery to
year 4) in mainstream schools. The majority of children
referred to the team are year one pupils (4 –5 year olds),
attending schools in areas of low socio-economic status
(LSES). There is evidence that for all of the referred chil-
dren, teachers have identified concerns around their
attention and language skills [ 32]. The RISE teams have
developed a whole-class programme, known as the
Attention and Listening Programme (ALP), that they
currently provide to schools on request. This
programme is similar to RECALL in its structure and
format but it is not underpinned by WM theory and has
not been robustly evaluated.
This protocol describes the rationale, methods and
analysis plan for a proposed cluster randomised feasibil-
ity trial that will compare RECALL to the existing ALP
intervention and education as usual. It aims to resolve
uncertainties about the acceptability of RECALL to those
who would be delivering it (health professionals and
teachers), assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive
cluster randomised trial (CRT) of its effectiveness and
make a novel contribution to the WM literature regard-
ing the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of
WM training in real-life contexts.
Study aim and objectives
The key research question is whether it is possible to de-
sign a definitive CRT that will evaluate whether RECALL
is more effective than an existing intervention (ALP),Rowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 2 of 16
and education as usual, for enhancing WM, attention
and language skills in 4 –5 year olds from LSES areas.
We will conduct a cluster randomised feasibility trial
that will enable us to:
1. Examine the acceptability of the novel RECALL
programme and its accompanying manual to the
health professionals and teachers who deliver it.
2. Measure the implementation of RECALL by health
professionals and teachers including compliance
and fidelity of delivery.
3. Understand the trial processes at the cluster and
individual levels including recruitment, consent and
sampling procedures, attendance levels and loss to
follow-up.
4. Determine the acceptability of randomisation to
schools.
5. Explore the appropriateness of the existing
intervention (ALP) as an active control comparator
to the experimental RECALL programme.
6. Explore how WM, attention and language skills are
typically supported in the classroom (education as
usual).
7. Determine the appropriateness and acceptability of
the outcome measures for the children, teachers
and health professionals.
8. Identify the facilitators and barriers (at the cluster
and individual levels) to the implementation of
RECALL and refine the intervention ’s logic model.1
Methods/design
This study is a three-arm, cluster randomised feasibility
trial with a parallel group design. The novel RECALL
classroom programme will be compared to an existing
intervention (ALP , the active control) and education as
usual (the no intervention control). The delivery of the in-
terventions at the classroom level necessitates the use of a
cluster design for this study [ 34,35]w i t he a c hs c h o o lc o n -
stituting a cluster. The experimental RECALL programme
and the active control intervention will be delivered by
health professionals from the multi-disciplinary RISE
teams once per week. Thus, they will demonstrate the
programmes for the teachers who will then provide two
further practice sessions during the week.
Children ’s outcomes will be measured at two time
points (baseline and 1-week post-intervention). The
protocol has been developed according to the SPIRIT
2013 Statement [ 36] recommendations for protocol
items for clinical trials and the CONSORT 2010 exten-
sion to cluster randomised pilot and feasibility trials
[37]. Throughout the trial, a process evaluation will ex-
plore the factors that could impact on the internal and
external validity of a future CRT and the intervention ’s
logic model for RECALL will be refined [ 38,39]. Figure 1shows the flow chart of the study and Fig. 2illustrates
the timing of all trial processes.
Setting
This is a multi-site trial that will be conducted in pri-
mary schools in one region of the UK, Northern Ireland
(NI), where children commence formal education at
4 years of age. The mainstream school population in NI
includes a wide range of children including those with
undiagnosed and diagnosed learning or developmental
difficulties. Year one classes typically have one teacher,
supported by a classroom assistant (CA). The multidis-
ciplinary RISE teams are based within each of the five
Health and Social Care Trusts (HSCT) in NI and this
study will take place in two of the HSCT areas. The RISE
teams work in partnership with schools and provide a
range of services including: specialist assessment and
intervention for referred children with recognised devel-
opmental difficulties; and targeted support for vulnerable
children (considered to be at risk of developmental diffi-
culties). Targeted interventions include whole-class and
group programmes focusing on particular skills such as
attention and listening. The aim of these interventions is
to support all children in accessing the curriculum and
reduce underachievement [ 40].
Sample size and participants
As this is a feasibility study, and the purpose is to ex-
plore the acceptability of the intervention rather than its
effectiveness, a formal a priori power calculation has not
been conducted [ 41]. The results will not be used to
estimate the sample size, intra-cluster correlation or
treatment effects for a definitive trial because, in the case
of cluster randomised feasibility trials, these can be un-
realistic and misleading [ 42,43]. Therefore, the number
of clusters and individual participants to be recruited
has been selected in order to assess the acceptability and
feasibility of RECALL and the outcome measures for
children ’s WM, attention and language skills.
At the cluster level, six schools in areas of LSES will
be recruited in total. One class of children in year one
(n=~ 30) will participate in each school (total: n=~ 180
children). Two classes will receive the RECALL
programme, two will receive the active control interven-
tion (ALP) and two will receive education as usual. In
the schools allocated to the to RISE and ALP groups, all
of the children in the participating classes will receive
the interventions. Health professionals from the RISE
teams (SLTs, OTs, PTs and SEBs) will be recruited to
deliver the RECALL and active control interventions.
Stratification of children
At the individual level, ten children, their parents/guard-
ians and teachers will be recruited in each class toRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 3 of 16
complete the outcome measures (total sample: n=60
children). Due to the age of the children involved in this
study (4 –5 year olds), the number of standardised
measures available, particularly of WM and attention, is
limited. To determine the appropriateness and accept-
ability of the outcome measures that have been selected,
they will be trialled with children representing the typ-
ical range of ability in a year one class. Hence, we willuse stratified purposeful sampling [ 44]. Teachers in each
class will identify children in three sub-groups/strata: (1)
children about whom they have concerns around listen-
ing and communication skills but do not have a diag-
nosed developmental or learning difficulty ( n=5); (2)
children with diagnosed developmental or learning diffi-
culties ( n=2); and (3) typically developing children who
do not have any identified listening and communicationFig. 1 RECALL cluster randomised feasibility trial: protocol flow chartRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 4 of 16

problems as recognised by the teachers ( n=3 per class).
Children considered to be typically developing, within
areas of social disadvantage, will be included due to the
high incidence of speech, language and communication
needs in this population [ 3].
Recruitment strategy
To recruit clusters, areas of LSES will be identified using
data from the Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation
Measure (NIMDM) 2017 [ 45]. The NIMDM ranks the
super output areas in NI from the most to the least de-
prived across seven types (or domains) of deprivation.
An initial scope of this data indicated that there are
approximately 72 primary schools in LSES areas in the
two HSCTs where this study will take place. These
schools will be ranked according to the Education, Skills
and Training domain of the NIMDM and the aim is to
recruit schools within the lowest decile for each HSCT
area. Two local collaborators will be consulted in order
to identify schools that meet the eligibility criteria
(Table 1). Schools will be contacted in writing by the
researchers, followed up by a phone call and a face-to-
face meeting with the principal and year one teachers to
discuss the study further. If more than one teacher in a
school is interested in participating in the study, one
class will be randomly selected.
To recruit children and their parents/guardians for
outcome measurement ( n= 10 in each school), the
teachers will send a user-friendly research information
leaflet, participant information sheet (PIS) and consent
form home with each child. Parents will return the
signed consent form to their child ’s teacher. From the
list of children for whom consent is obtained, the
teacher will choose ten pupils for outcome measurement
according to the stratified sampling method. To enhanceenrolment and retention in the study, parents who
complete the communication skills rating scale at both
the pre-and post-intervention time-points will be
entered into a prize draw for a £100 supermarket shop-
ping voucher.
To recruit the health professionals to deliver the inter-
vention, the team mangers will identify the professionals
who meet the eligibility criteria (Table 1) and dissemin-
ate the PIS and consent form. Staff will email the re-
searcher to indicate their interest in the study and a
meeting will be arranged to discuss this further and
obtain written consent.
Eligibility criteria
Table 1provides the inclusion and exclusion criteria for
each participant group and the rationale for each
prerequisite.
Consent
At the cluster level, written consent for trial entry will
be obtained from the school principals [ 35]. Individual
consent for participation will then be obtained from all
other participants [ 34]. The teachers, parents/guardians
and children will be asked to take part without being ex-
plicitly told about which intervention they will receive.
This means consent is not fully informed but it reduces
the risk of selection bias and enhances the internal valid-
ity of the study [ 47]. The acceptability of this and its im-
pact on recruitment will be examined in the process
evaluation. Consent from the health professionals and
school staff will be obtained during the pre-study meet-
ings with the first author. Regarding children ’s participa-
tion in the study, parental consent will be obtained.
Child assent is deemed to be inappropriate in this study
due to the age of the children. Although some 5-year-

old children may be able to provide assent [ 48], there
are considerable challenges in knowing if this is accurate
[49]. The amount of autonomy children typically exer-
cise in a given situation is also an important consider-
ation [ 50]. The RECALL programme will be delivered as
part of the educational curriculum and in this context
children typically have limited autonomy. Although chil-
dren will not assent to take part, parents will be asked to
inform their children that the study is taking place and
will be given a child-friendly leaflet to help them tell
their child about the research. If parents do not return
the consent form, the child will still receive the RECALL
or active control interventions but they will not be part
of the research study and no outcome measurement will
be carried out with them.
Randomisation and allocation
The six schools will be randomised to each arm of the
trial: two will receive RECALL; two will receive the
active control intervention (ALP); and two will receive
education as usual. This will be conducted by the
schools ’names being placed in opaque, sealed envelopes
which will be selected by an independent person from
within the lead researchers ’institute. This process has
been deemed as introducing a low risk of bias in alloca-
tion concealment [ 51]. Randomisation will occur after
baseline data collection with the children. As previously
indicated, children will be selected for outcome meas-
urement using stratification. The teacher will sort the
names of all those whose parents provide written in-
formed consent into the three strata previously specified.
If more than the required number in each sub-group
consent, the participants will be randomly selected using
the same process of placing names in opaque envelopes.
Interventions
The experimental, theoretically underpinned RECALL
programme and the active control interventions both in-
corporate group and whole-class activities designed to
be fun for young children. The programmes are compar-
able in their structure, format and dosage (intervention
frequency and duration). They both consist of six, 40-
min sessions that are repeated three times per week for
6 weeks (18 sessions in total). The first session each
week will be delivered by the health professionals who
will model the activities for the teachers so that they can
deliver the two further practice sessions.
Experimental intervention: RECALL
RECALL is a theoretically underpinned, multi-
component, manualised intervention that explicitly tar-
gets WM skills in 4 –5 year olds to enhance attention
and language skills. It is underpinned by individual
change theory (why the intervention components areexpected to benefit WM and produce near- and far-
transfer effects) and systems theory (considering the role
of the school context in affecting change) [ 52–55]. It
was co-produced through a series of workshops with
one group of teachers, parents and health professionals
in an inter-sectoral partnership [ 54].
Individual theory of change The tasks included in RE-
CALL are based on evidence from a recent systematic
review [ 56]. The review found certain tasks designed to
either target WM directly (listening recall and odd-one-
out) or indirectly (cognitively-demanding physical activ-
ity, inhibition, phoneme awareness and fantastical play)
produced improvements on WM and some benefits for
near-transfer activities [ 57–67]. The common ingredient
across the effective interventions was predominantly the
executive-loaded nature of the trained task, i.e. training
on a task that taps into attentional and processing re-
sources under executive control and not just the storage
of information [ 56]. It has been suggested that repeated
practice on executive-loaded working memory (ELWM)
tasks (rather than practising storage-only, short-term
memory tasks) may improve the efficiency of processing
or perhaps even facilitate the storage of information in
WM [ 58,68]. Based on this evidence, all of the compo-
nents in RECALL are executive-loaded tasks, where at-
tention must be divided between the storage and
processing demands of the task. This may overlap with
the way attention is used in everyday (real-world) activ-
ities. Hence, since treatment effects are more likely to
transfer from trained activities to activities with overlap-
ping features [ 26], the direct training on ELWM tasks in
RECALL may benefit untrained WM tasks and real-
world skills including attention and language.
In addition to directly training ELWM skills, RECALL
includes two other tasks that were identified in the sys-
tematic review as having potential. Interventions target-
ing phoneme awareness skills [ 64,65] and fantastical
play [ 66] were found to impact WM indirectly. These
are included in RECALL due to their associations with
functional language outcomes and attention. They are
complementary to and consistent with the theory that
ELWM tasks support WM because they are also
executive-loaded tasks, i.e. they tap into processing and
attentional resources under executive control. Phoneme
awareness is the ability to isolate and manipulate sounds
in spoken words [ 69]. Improving phoneme awareness
might enhance the phonological mechanisms underlying
WM, through increasing the efficiency of processing and
supporting the creation of accurate, structured phono-
logical representations. This may in turn support
language development since our ability to recall words
depends on their phonological representations in long-
term memory [ 70,71].Rowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 7 of 16
Fantastical play is a type of pretend play that is
fantasy-oriented [ 66]. For example, pretend play could
involve pretending to make tea, whereas fantastical play
might involve pretending to make swamp tea for a giant.
Engaging in fantastical play may support children ’sW M
and other executive functions which are used to support
switching between fantasy and reality and remembering
the rules/scripts of the pretence [ 72,73].
Systems theory of change (intervention delivery
model) The theory underpinning how the ELWM tasks
in RECALL can be delivered in the classroom was devel-
oped through the co-production workshops. The socio-
ecological model [ 74] was used as a framework to
inform the development of an intervention logic model
(i.e. a pictorial representation of the relationships be-
tween the required resources, activities needed, mecha-
nisms of change and desired outcomes [ 33]). This
supported the identification of multi-level factors that
may impact on the programme delivery in the class-
room, e.g. the timing of intervention sessions in the
classroom, the availability of resources and staff training
needs. Consequently, the theory underpinning thedelivery of RECALL is that the co-designed tasks will
work in the classroom context when staff are supported
with adequate training and a detailed manual. The
health professionals model one RECALL session per
week in the classroom. The teachers follow the activity
plan in the RECALL manual so that they become famil-
iar with the tasks and can deliver them independently a
further two times in the week. Detailed session plans
and accompanying materials such as picture stimuli and
worksheets are provided in the RECALL manual.
RECALL components The ELWM tasks incorporated
into RECALL include direct training on two ELWM
tasks (listening recall and odd one out [ 58]), phoneme
awareness training [ 64,65] and fantastical play [ 66].
Table 2provides a description of each task.
Task progression The manipulation of WM loads on a
trial-by-trial basis may be important for improving WM
where research has particularly shown the value of adap-
tive training, i.e. task difficulty that increases or de-
creases automatically based on an individual child ’s
performance [ 77]. As RECALL is to be delivered in the
Table 2 RECALL components and task progression
RECALL component (ELWM task) Task progression
Listening recall (direct WM training)
- This task targets verbal ELWM.
- The children listen to a short sentence, judge
whether it is true or false and recall the last word
of the sentence.The number of to-be-remembered words increases
from one word in week one to two words by week 6.
Odd one out (direct WM training)
- This task targets visuospatial ELWM.
- The children look at three pictures in a grid,
decide where one the odd one out is
(left, middle or right), then recall the location of
the odd one out picture.The number of to-be-remembered locations increases
from one in week one, to three or four by week 6.
Phoneme awareness training
There are four types of phoneme awareness task in
RECALL, focusing on developing awareness of the
initial sounds in words.
1. Alliterative matching: finding things that start
with a target sound. E.g., “Book starts with ‘b’. Can
you find the other things that start with ‘b’?”
2. Segmenting initial sounds: “what sound
does ____ start with? ”
3. Alliterative matching and blending the target to
generate new words: “Find the one that starts
with ___? Let us think of other things that start with _ ”
4. Blending sounds to identify words: “Look at these
pictures. Can you find the b –all? ”The four tasks develop from the easiest (alliterative matching)
to the most difficult (blending sounds) [ 75].
The difficulty level of the practice items in each task progresses
from early to late developing phonemes based on typical speech
sound development [ 76].
Fantastical play
There is no direct training on fantastical play in RECALL.
This is integrated into the programme through the use of
a fantastical theme for each session, e.g. superheroes.
However, the direct ELWM and phoneme awareness tasks
incorporate the theme of each session throughout i.e., the
words and pictures used relate to the theme.Rowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 8 of 16
group context, individual adaptive profiles cannot be
rolled out. Instead, the programme is designed to be-
come progressively more difficult across its 6 weeks.
Table 2shows how the direct ELWM and phoneme
awareness tasks in RECALL progress in difficulty across
the course of the 6-week programme. Due to two novel
features of the RECALL trial (the age of the children
and the group nature of the intervention), establishing
the span level at which to commence training and how
to increase the level of difficulty from week to week was
reasoned from previous studies with older children [ 58].
The appropriateness of this for 4 –5 year olds will be
explored in this feasibility trial.
Dosage The amount and intensity of training is often
poorly reported in WM studies [ 56].2The dosage to be
implemented in RECALL is based on the best available
evidence from the systematic review which indicated
that 11 trials (practice items) of each direct ELWM task
(listening recall and odd one out) delivered three times
per week for 6 weeks was effective [ 58]. For the phon-
eme awareness tasks, the dose (number of trials) admin-
istered in previous interventions is unclear. However,
several studies identified that training sessions lasted
10–15 min [ 64,65] and this is replicated in RECALL.
Structure of RECALL sessions Each of the six RECALL
sessions follows the same format, incorporating whole-
class and group activities (Fig. 3). The fantastical theme
for the week is introduced using a puppet who tells the
children they are going on an adventure. The children
are encouraged to enter into the fantasy by moving likecharacters in the fantastical land, e.g. posing like a
superhero. The children are then divided into three
groups that rotate around the direct ELWM and phon-
eme awareness training activities. The sessions close
with another whole-class activity so the puppet takes
them back to the reality of the classroom.
Active control group: existing ALP
The active control group in this study will receive an exist-
ing intervention (ALP) developed and used by the RISE
teams. This has been selected as the active control condi-
tion because the programme is delivered in the same way
as RECALL, i.e. the health professionals model the activ-
ities for the teachers and provide them with session plans
so that they can replicate them. The programme also has
the same dosage as RECALL (six, 40-min sessions that are
repeated three times per week delivered once by the
health professionals and twice the teachers). This recog-
nises the importance of equating the training intensity
between groups in WM research [ 24,79].
The crucial difference between this programme and
the experimental RECALL intervention is that the ALP
intervention is not underpinned by WM theory. It aims
to improve children ’s attention and listening skills
through repeated practice at listening tasks (e.g. the
facilitator reads a story and the children must shake a
musical instrument when they hear a particular word). It
focuses on teaching children the importance of listening
and on the use of visual, verbal and behavioural strategies
to support listening, e.g. proximal praise. The tasks do not
require the children to recall verbal or visuospatial infor-
mation and they are not all executive-loaded. Whether

this intervention is sufficiently different to act as a com-
parator in a full CRT will be explored in this trial.
No intervention control: education as usual
The two schools in this arm of the trial will not receive
any whole-class interventions such as RECALL and the
active control intervention during the 6-week trial
period. Their teachers will be delivering the education
curriculum as usual. How the teachers in these classes
support the children ’s attention and language skills dur-
ing the study period will be explored in semi-structured
interviews at the end of the trial.
Compliance and fidelity
To enhance the implementation of RECALL, the health
professionals, who will be modelling the programme
each week for the teachers, will attend a 2-day training
course prior to delivering it. They will be given the
detailed programme manual which they will also supply
to the teachers. To monitor compliance with the
programme delivery and dosage, the health professionals
and teachers will be asked to keep a simple log of their
implementation (e.g. how often they delivered the
programme and how long for). To monitor fidelity, three
RECALL sessions in each school (one delivered by the
health professional team and two by the teacher) will be
observed by the first author. One of the health profes-
sional sessions and one of the teacher-delivered sessions
will be observed simultaneously by a second member of
the research team who will independently rate the deliv-
ery. Agreement between the raters will be checked by a
third member of the team.
The researchers will use a structured observation tool
designed within Carroll et al. ’s( 2 0 0 7 )[ 80]c o n c e p t u a l
framework to explore four key elements of implementa-
tion (content, coverage, frequency, duration) and four
moderating variables (intervention complexity, facilitation
strategies, quality of delivery and participant responsive-
ness). Since this is a feasibility study, some adaptation to
the intervention will be allowed (i.e. the researchers may
address any problems raised by the health professionals or
teachers). Any advice given will be recorded and examined
in the process evaluation [ 81]. The interventions will be
discontinued if a teacher withdraws from the study. If a
health professional withdraws, another member of staff
will be recruited and trained.
Blinding
The school participants (principal, teachers and class-
room assistants) and parents/guardians in the two inter-
vention groups will be blinded to their group allocation.
It is especially important that teachers and parents are
blinded to group allocation, as their ratings of children ’s
attention skills will be used as outcome measures [ 25].Maintaining the teachers ’blinding for the duration of
the trial may be challenging, especially if the participat-
ing schools are in close geographical proximity to each
other. This will be explored as part of the process evalu-
ation in this study. Blinding of the health professionals
to the schools ’allocation will not be possible as the
teams will inevitably know which intervention they are
delivering. The risk of this influencing the outcomes will
be minimised further by the blinding of the research
assistant (RA) who will be collecting the outcomes data.
Whether the RA becomes aware of group allocation will
also be investigated during the process evaluation.
Outcome measures
Table 3details the data that will be gathered at the cluster
and individual levels to meet the primary objectives of this
study regarding the acceptability of RECALL in the school
setting and the feasibility of the trial processes.
Data collection
The acceptability and feasibility data will be gathered
throughout the study and during the process evaluation
(see Fig. 1). In WM research, it is essential to demonstrate
clear causal pathways [ 25]. A future large-scale trial of the
effectiveness of RECALL would therefore have to include
a range of measures of children ’s outcomes including mea-
sures of the trained activities (WM and phoneme aware-
ness skills), untrained WM tasks (near-transfer) and
attention and language skills (far-transfer effects). Testing
the feasibility and acceptability of measuring all of these
skills with 4 –5 year olds, for whom the range of standar-
dised assessments is limited, is one of the key objectives of
this feasibility trial. This will occur at two points, baseline
and post-intervention (see Fig. 2). Four types of measure-
ment will be trialled with the sample of ten children in
each cluster.
1. Standardised assessments administered directly with
the children by a trained research assistant (RA).
The RA, who will be blinded to group allocation,
will withdraw children individually from their
classroom for approximately one hour at each time
point to complete the following standardised
assessments:
a) Phoneme awareness: The Preschool and Primary
Inventory of Phonological Awareness (PIPA) [ 82].
This test is standardised for children aged 3 years to
6 years 11 months. It includes six subtests
examining a range of phonological awareness skills.
The phoneme isolation subtest will be used to
directly assess children ’s ability to identify the initialRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 10 of 16
sound in a word, thereby providing a measure of a
task directly trained in RECALL.
b) Working memory: The Automated Working
Memory Assessment (AWMA) [ 83]i sa
computerised assessment that will be administered
using a laptop. This test has good validity as a
measure of WM compared to other assessments
[84]. Good test-retest reliability has also been dem-
onstrated [ 15] and this measure is used widely in
WM research. Two subtests will measure trained
executive-loaded WM skills (listening recall and
odd one out). Four further subtests will measure
WM tasks not directly trained in the intervention
(near-transfer effects). These subtests (digit recall,
block recall, counting recall and non-word recall)
have been selected due to their use in previous
studies [ 58,85].c) Attention: NEPSY-II –A Developmental
Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY) [ 86].
Standardised, performance-based measures of
attention for children under 6 years are limited
[87]. The NEPSY-II is one of the few available
assessments that includes attention subtests
suitable for children of 4 –5 years and (or its
previous edition) has been administered in
relevant studies [ 67].
2. Language: The New Reynell Developmental
Language Scales (NRDLS) [ 88] is a standardised
assessment for children aged between 3 years and
7 years 6 months. It has two scales: one that
examines children ’s understanding of selectedTable 3 Acceptability and feasibility data at the cluster and individual levels

vocabulary items and grammatical features (the
Comprehension Scale); and another that tests
children ’s production of the same features of
language (the Production Scale). This test is widely
used in clinical and research contexts [ 89] in the
identification of language impairment. It uses
objects (rather than picture stimuli) during the
assessment and this should make it accessible to the
target population in this study.
3.A teacher rating scale of the child ’s attention in the
classroom: The Behaviour Rating Scale of Executive
Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) [ 90]. This
tool is designed to specifically measure the
behavioural characteristics associated with executive
function skills including WM. It is a standardised,
validated scale consisting of 63 items that can be
used with children from 2 years to 5 years
11 months. It has good clinical utility and sensitivity
and has been shown to complement performance-
based measures of executive functions including
WM [ 91,92].
4.A parent rating scale of the child ’s language and
communication skills at home. The Focus on
Communication Outcomes Under Six (FOCUS)
[93]. This has shown excellent test-retest reliability
and internal consistency [ 94]. The forms will be
posted to the parents one week before each data
collection point and they will be asked to return the
form to their child ’s teacher. The completed forms
will be collected by the RA along with the teacher-
completed BRIEF-P.
5.Weekly monitoring of the child ’s performance on the
trained tasks. Capturing individual responses will be
an important part of a large-scale CRT due to the
need for WM training to be adaptive. Therefore,
assessing the feasibility of measuring children ’s
progress from week to week is an important part of
the current feasibility study. For the classes
receiving RECALL, the children ’s performance on
the direct WM and phoneme awareness tasks will
take place during the first session each week which
is delivered by the RISE NI teams. It is anticipated
that the presence of additional adults in the
classroom will facilitate this process. Each child will
have a RECALL booklet in which they will complete
the tasks using stampers or by drawing circles
around the target pictures to indicate their
responses. This will not be possible for some tasks
that require purely verbal responses. For these
tasks, digital voice recorders will be used (with
parental consent) to record what the children say.
There are significant uncertainties around the
feasibility of audio-recording such data amidst the
background classroom noise. Due to the level ofuncertainty around this method, we aim to carry
this out with just five, randomly selected children,
in one of the RECALL classes. The voice recorder
will be placed in a small gadget-holder which the
children will wear across their bodies. A tie-clip
microphone, connected to the recorder, will be
placed on the children ’s jumpers or lapels. The
devices will be switched on and off by the teacher
or classroom assistant.
Data analysis
The feasibility data will be analysed and reported de-
scriptively using means, frequencies and percentages.
The data will be summarised and presented graphically.
A CONSORT flow diagram will be used to report the re-
sponse, recruitment and retention rate of clusters and
individual participants at each point of the study. Where
available, reasons for attrition and loss to follow-up will
be reported.
Regarding the data obtained from the outcome measures
completed with the children, sta tistical significance of treat-
ment effects will not be analysed as this study would be
under-powered for this purpose. However, between group
comparisons will be conduct ed to inform the statistical
model for the future trial. This will include two elements:
(1) a series of one-way analyses (ANOVAs) of the baseline
data of children ’ss t a n d a r d i s e ds c o r e so nt h ew o r k i n gm e m -
ory (AWMA), attention (NEPSY subtests) and language
measures (CELF-P) to investigate pre-intervention group
differences; and (2) a series of analyses of covariance
(ANCOVAs) to investigate post-intervention group differ-
ences). As the standardised assessments of WM, language
and attention will be repeated within a short time-frame,
results from the education as usual group will be used to
examine test-retest effects. Qualitative analysis of the data
gathered in the semi-structured interviews will be carried
out using Braun and Clarke ’s (2006) thematic analysis [ 95].
Process evaluation
A process evaluation will be conducted throughout the
study to support an understanding of how the trial pro-
cesses relate to the context within which RECALL will
be implemented [ 80]. The cluster and individual level
data on the acceptability and feasibility of RECALL will
be integrated with the qualitative findings and observa-
tions of cluster characteristics using the model proposed
by Grant et al. [ 96]. Through this, the barriers and facili-
tators to implementation will be explored and the inter-
vention logic model developed during the co-production
phase will be refined.
Criteria for proceeding to a full CRT
The primary factor for consideration as to whether to
proceed to a full trial will be the feasibility data pertainingRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 12 of 16
to recruitment and retention rates and the completion of
outcome measures. However, strict thresholds for progres-
sion have not been set as these factors can be influenced
by contextual variations that may not impact on a future
trial [ 42,97]. Rather, the decision to proceed to a main
trial will be made along by the research team in collabor-
ation with the Trial Steering Committee. Solutions to any
problems observed in the feasibility trial will be sought
through four potential options suggested by Bugge et al.
[98]: (1) adapt the intervention, (2) adjust the context
within which the intervention would be delivered, (3)
amend elements of the trial design or (4) implement a
combination of all of these actions.
Monitoring
Trial steering committee
The conduct of this trial will be overseen by a Trial
Steering Committee (TSC) that includes experienced re-
searchers, key stakeholders from the health and educa-
tion sectors in NI and service users. This group has
been involved in the design of the trial and will meet at
an interim point to review the progress towards the trial
aims and to monitor the safety and well-being of all par-
ticipants. Due to the nature and purpose of the primary
data to be collected in this study (feasibility and accept-
ability measures), a Data Management Committee is not
deemed necessary at this stage but will be established
prior to the definitive CRT.
Modifications
Any modifications to the study protocol such as the eli-
gibility criteria, recruitment procedures or outcome
measures will only be carried out in agreement with the
TSC. The changes made and reasons underlying them
will be carefully recorded as these could be vital to the
design of the future trial.
Stopping guidelines
Any adverse events occurring in the course of the trial
will be carefully recorded and reported to the TSC, al-
though this is not anticipated given the low risk nature
of the study. The TSC will be contacted in this unlikely
event and the trial may be discontinued. The study may
also be discontinued if both schools in the RECALL arm
of the trial withdraw. In the case of the trial being
discontinued, all of the other active participants will be
informed. The active control intervention may be con-
tinued as part of routine practice by the health profes-
sionals but no further data would be collected from the
children for outcome measurement. The parents would
be informed accordingly.Ethical considerations
As noted, this is a low-risk study in that no additional
potential harm is associated with the research compared
to the everyday activity of the participants. The main
ethical considerations relate to the welfare of children,
parental consent and the children ’s capacity to assent,
and the maintenance of confidentiality. The schools ’pol-
icies regarding health and safety and child protection
will be obtained in advance by the research team and
adhered to throughout the trial. All members of the re-
search team will hold valid Access NI Enhanced Disclos-
ure Certificates3confirming they are permitted to work
with children in compliance with NI legislation. Through
the whole-class sessions, it is possible that children with
neurodevelopmental difficulties may be identified by the
health professionals. In this instance they will advise the
teacher of an appropriate service to which the child
could be referred and ask them to seek parental consent
prior to making a referral. Children who already attend
another service will continue to receive this support dur-
ing the trial. The procedures for obtaining parental con-
sent in this study have been designed according to
guidance provided by the Health Research Authority
(2017) [ 50] (see consent section). All information/data
obtained during the study will remain confidential and
will be held in accordance with the General Data Protec-
tion Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Aside from the initial
consent forms, all further material will be identified by
unique number only, with no identifying information.
The procedures used to ensure anonymity and confiden-
tiality may be subject to audit through Ulster University ’s
annual audit programme.
Dissemination
The findings from this trial will be disseminated to all of
the participants at a local level through informal networks
in the first instance. At a national and international level,
the results will be disseminated through conferences and
publications in professional literature and peer-reviewed
journals prior to the final design and conduct of a full CRT.
Discussion
To our knowledge, RECALL is the first theoretically
underpinned, multi-component, whole-class interven-
tion that specifically aims to enhance WM, attention
and language skills in 4 –5-year-old children through
activities applied within their everyday context. This
study responds to calls for ecologically valid approaches
to WM intervention for young children [ 28,99] and the
testing of creative approaches for children with low-
language ability who are at risk of academic under-
achievement and poor employment prospects [ 8,9].
A realist perspective underpins all stages of this re-
search, influencing the intervention development, trialRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:82 Page 13 of 16
design and process evaluation. This approach recognises
the impact of context on the implementation of inter-
ventions in real-life settings [ 39,52,53], which has been
lacking in WM research to date. Therefore, the findings
from this feasibility study will be of interest to re-
searchers and practitioners interested in implementing
WM interventions in the classroom.
In particular, the observations of RECALL being deliv-
ered in the classroom will allow investigation of whether
it is possible for WM interventions to be delivered in
the classroom with fidelity to their design and dosage.
Key in this examination will be whether the executive-
loaded nature of the trained tasks is maintained in their
implementation. The inclusion of qualitative data in the
process evaluation is a strength of this feasibility trial.
This will allow us to explore participants ’views on the
acceptability of RECALL and, crucially, the reasons for
any differences between the intervention model and
their fidelity to it. Thus we will be able to identify issues
that may impact on the external and internal validity of
a large-scale CRT.
The study design takes cognisance of the previous
criticisms of the methodological quality of previous WM
research [ 23–25], through the inclusion of an active con-
trol group (receiving a comparable intervention in terms
of structure and dosage) and the blinding of outcomes as-
sessors. The findings from this feasibility study will inform
whether it can be scaled-up into a full CRT to evaluate the
clinical and cost-effectiveness of RECALL.
Trial status
Recruitment will commence in December 2018.
