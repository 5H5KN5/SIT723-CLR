Abstract
Background: Newborn blood spot (NBS) screening seeks to prevent ill health, disability and death through
early diagnosis and effective intervention. Each year, around 10,000 parents of babies born in England are given
a positive NBS result indicating their child may be affected or carriers of one of the nine conditions currently
screened for. Despite guidance, these results are inconsistently delivered to parents across geographical regions.
There is evidence that many parents are dissatisfied with how NBS results are communicated to them and that
poor communication practices can lead to various negative sequelae. The purpose of this study is to co-design,
implement and undertake a process evaluation of new, co-designed interventions to improve delivery of initial
positive NBS results to parents.
Methods: This mixed-methods study will use four phases with defined outputs. Family Systems Theory will form
the theoretical basis for the study. The principles and methods of experience-based co-design will underpin
intervention development. Normalisation Process Theory will underpin the process evaluation of the interventions
co-designed to improve the delivery of positive NBS results to parents. An economic analysis will determine
resource use and costs of current practice and of implementing the new co-designed interventions. The nominal
group technique will be used to inform the selection of suitable outcome measures for a future evaluation study.
Discussion: The main output of the proposed study will be co-designed interventions for initial communication
of positive NBS results to parents ready to be evaluated in a definitive evaluation study.
The interventions, co-designed with parents, will help to minimise potential negative sequelae associated with
poor communication practices by considering parental and staff experiences as well as healthcare challenges
such as finite resources. In addition, information about indicative costs associated with different communication
strategies will be determined.
It is anticipated it may also be possible to extrapolate principles of good communication practices from the present

study for the delivery of bad news to parents for children newly diagnosed with other conditions including cancer
and other chronic conditions such as diabetes or epilepsy.
Trial registration: ISRCTN 15330120 date of registration 17/01/2018
Keywords: Newborn bloodspot screening, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle cell disease, Metabolic, Congenital hypothyroid
Background
Newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) in the UK involves
obtaining parents ’informed consent to take a small sam-
ple of blood from their baby ’s heel (heel prick) on day 5
of life to determine if the baby may be affected by one of
nine life-changing conditions1. These conditions are as
follows: sickle cell disease (SCD), cystic fibrosis (CF),
congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria, medium-
chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, maple syrup
urine disease, isovaleric acidaemia, glutaric aciduria type
1 and homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive). A posi-
tive NBS (NBS+) result indicates that the baby may be
affected or be a carrier of one of these conditions and
will often require further diagnostic testing before a
definitive diagnosis is made [ 1].
Each year in England, over 10,000 parents are in-
formed of their child ’s NBS+ result around 2 –8 weeks,
depending on the condition, after birth [ 2,3]. Most
babies with initial NBS+ results for SCD and approxi-
mately half of those with an NBS+ result for CF will
later be confirmed as gene carriers but unaffected by the
disease. However, over 1300 babies will eventually be
diagnosed as being affected by one of the conditions
currently screened for [ 2,3].
Variation in communication practice in the UK
There is evidence of regional variations in the UK with
regard to the approaches used to communicate NBS+
results and, in particular, suspected carrier status for CF
and SCD following NBS. These approaches include re-
ceiving the result by letter to in-person communication
during a home visit [ 4,5]. The findings of Kai et al. ’s
study [ 5] informed the development of the current na-
tional guidelines for the communication process in the
NBS Programme (NBSP), which recommend face-to-face
communication by an appropriately trained health pro-
fessional [ 1]. Despite these guidelines, a recent study
with parents exploring their experience of receiving CF
or SCD carrier results following NBS indicated that dis-
parity continues to exist regarding how the guidelines
are implemented in practice [ 6].Impact of poor communication practices
Poor, or inappropriate, communication strategies for
NBS+ can influence parental outcomes in the short term
[6–11] and may also have long-term impact [ 12]. Evidence
suggests the distress caused can manifest in several ways
including arguments between couples including appor-
tioning of blame [ 6,9,13], alteration of life plans and in-
ability to conduct tasks of daily living such as going to
work or socialising [ 6], long-term alterations in parent-
child relationships [ 12] and mistrust and lack of confi-
dence affecting ongoing relationships with staff [ 9]. There
is also evidence of increased parental distress resulting in
parents reducing their child ’s interaction with others, par-
ticularly in the case of CF [ 6]. Parents also experienced
poor intra- and interpersonal relationships within their
family system and more widely [ 14].
With the expansion of the NBSP in the UK in 2015 and
further future growth planned [ 15], it is timely to ensure
that clinical advantages of th is process continue to out-
weigh potential long term ne gative psychosocial conse-
quences for the families involved. It is essential that
approaches used to deliver this information to parents are
informed by them and shaped to meet their needs. It may
not be possible to remove paren tal distress completely from
what is an upsetting time. However, it is important for staff
to communicate NBS+ results in a manner that minimises
distress to families and does not detrimentally affect
parents ’relationships with the ir child and other family
members. Empirical evidence is lacking on the potential
impact of information provisi on on parental well-being and
decision-making strategies. As finite budgets are available
to provide communication strategies on a national level,
there is a need to understand both the short and long-term
costs of different aspects of the NBSP including the impli-
cations of providing NBS+ results. A further consideration
is ensuring parents are informed well enough to facilitate
communication within and between family members.
The aim of this study is to work with parents to co-de-
sign, implement and undertake a process evaluation (in-
cluding cost analysis) of new interventions to improve
the delivery of initial NBS+ results to parents.
Methods
Design
The theory underpinning the proposed study is Family
Systems Theory [ 16] because of the potential vulnerability1https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/newborn-blood-spot-
screening-programme-supporting-publicationsChudleigh et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:108 Page 2 of 11
of family relationships if the initial NBS+ information is
not shared as effectively and empathetically as possible
[17]. This mixed-methods study will use four phases with
defined outputs and will be guided by the Medical
Research Council Complex Interventions Framework [ 18].
A description of the phases and the study design can be
seen in Fig. 1. The principles and methods of experience-
based co-design (EBCD) will underpin intervention devel-
opment [ 19–25]. Normalisation Process Theory [ 26,27]
will underpin the process evaluation of the new, co-de-
signed interventions to improve the delivery of NBS+ re-
sults to parents. An economic analysis will be undertaken
to determine resource use and costs of current practice
and implementing the new co-designed interventions. The
process evaluation will be used to explain discrepancies
between expected and observed outcomes, contribute to
understanding how context influences those outcomes
and provide insights to aid planning of the future evalu-
ation study. The economic analysis will provide additional
data that will also be useful to stakeholders and decision
makers [ 18]. The nominal group technique [ 28,29]w i l lb e
used to plan the future evaluation study including selec-
tion of suitable outcome measures.
The nine conditions currently screened for by the
NBSP will be grouped into four condition-specific
groups (CSGs) based on the urgency with which com-
munication of the NBS+ result should occur (Table 1).Setting
In England, there are 13 newborn screening laboratories
that process the results for the nine conditions that are
currently included in the NBSP, and these will comprise
the study sites.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
For all study phases, parents of children who have re-
ceived a NBS+ result in the previous 3 –12 months in-
cluding true positives, false positives and children who
are diagnosed as ‘cystic fibrosis screen positive, inconclu-
sive diagnosis ’will be included in the study. Parents of
children who have received a negative NBS result or
with children with co-morbidities that are likely to influ-
ence their perception of receiving their NBS+ result and
parents whose recruitment is contraindicated on psycho-
social grounds (identified by their health visitor or
specialist nurse) will be excluded. Parents who are un-
able to understand and give informed consent will also
be excluded.
For all study phases, staff employed in NBS laborator-
ies and involved in the processing of NBS+ results and
staff who have been involved in communicating NBS+
results to parents in the last 6 months will be included.
Staff who have not been involved in processing NBS+
results or communicating NBS+ results to parents in the
Fig. 1 Study flow chartChudleigh et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:108 Page 3 of 11
last 6 months or who have personal experience of receiv-
ing a NBS+ result will be excluded.
Recruitment
For phase 1, contact details of Directors of NBS labora-
tories will be identified through the relevant website2.
Directors of newborn screening laboratories will be
invited to be the Lead Investigator for the study site and
will be asked to provide names and contact details of
staff within the laboratory who meet the inclusion
criteria for the study. These staff members will be con-
tacted via email and invited to participate. Members of
relevant clinical teams will be identified through the
individual trust websites.
During phases 2 and 3, staff identified in phase 1 as
being involved in the communication of positive new-
born screening results to parents in the selected study
sites will be contacted via email and invited to partici-
pate in these phase of the study.
During phases 2 and 3, parents who fit the inclusion
criteria will be identified by the relevant clinical nurse
specialist. Once eligible parents have been identified, a
member of the clinical team (Clinical Nurse Specialist or
doctor) will provide the parent with a participant infor-
mation sheet at their next routine clinic appointment
and ask the parents ’permission to provide their name
and telephone number to a member of the research
team. At least 24 h later, a member of the research team
will telephone the parents, give them the opportunity to
ask questions about the study and ask if they wish to
proceed with being involved.
During phase 4, key stakeholders will be identified by
the study steering committee using purposive sampling
to ensure the four CSGs are represented.
Demographic data
For all parents recruited to the study, data regarding
their age, gender and ethnicity will be collected. In
addition, they will be asked if the child who has received
the NBS+ result is their first child and whether they
have any other children. If they have other children, the
ages of these children as well as whether or not they alsohave any long-term medical conditions will also be
ascertained.
Consent
Written informed consent will be gathered for all partic-
ipants for each phase.
Phase 1: National survey
A national survey will be conducted to identify examples
of current approaches, and associated resource use, for
communication of NBS+ results from all 13 NBS labora-
tories via clinical teams to parents for each CSG in
England. The survey will be informed by the literature
and piloted before use in the main study. The survey,
comprising closed and open-ended questions, will be
conducted using semi-structured telephone interviews. It
will identify the ways NBS+ results are communicated
from the NBS laboratories to parents via a range of
health professionals by collecting data on the following:
the mode of communication strategy (face-to-face, letter,
telephone, e-mail), the resources involved in each com-
munication strategy, who provides the information and
their role, and location (co-located or alternative site) of
relevant services for the CSG. The communication path-
way currently used will be identified from the point at
which the laboratory produces the test result to when
the parents are told the definitive result.
Participants
Directors of all 13 NBS laboratories in England will be
invited to participate. In addition, up to 40 representa-
tive members (10 for each CSG) of local clinical teams
(medical consultants, general paediatricians, nurse spe-
cialists, health visitors, specialist screening nurses, gen-
etic counsellors) who receive laboratory results and are
identified as being involved in communicating positive
newborn screening results to parents will be invited as
well.
Data analysis
The purpose of data analysis will be to describe and iden-
tify approaches currently used to communicate the NBS+
results and identify potential study sites for phase 2 using
a predefined sampling framework (Fig. 2). QuantitativeTable 1 Condition-specific groups (CSGs)

data collected from the closed-ended questions will be
analysed using descriptive statistics. This might include,
for example, the number of people involved for each CSG,
the median and range of times each NBS laboratory has
been processing NBS results and the median and range of
times taken when communicating a NBS+ result to clin-
ical teams. Qualitative data from the open-ended ques-
tions will be analysed using content analysis [ 30]. An
inductive approach will be adopted. One interview tran-
script will be coded separately by two members of the
research team (double coded) in order to aid coding com-
parisons and inform and align code development [ 31]. A
code book will be developed based on these comparisons
and subsequent discussions in order to define the codes to
be used. This will be an ongoing, iterative process; new
codes may be developed during data analysis and the
definition of codes refined as analysis progresses [ 32]
Communication pathways for each of the 13 NBS labora-
tories (unit of analysis) will be described, by combining
quantitative and quantitative data. These data will be
presented to members of the study steering committee
and the lay advisory group who will be involved in the
decision regarding which study sites will be used in
subsequent study phases. These decisions will be based
on data from phase 1 regarding communication strat-
egies currently in use, statistics regarding the number
of babies who receive NBS+ results in each of the NBS
laboratories on an annual basis [ 2,3] and the sampling
framework (Fig. 2).
Data collected during this phase will also be used
in phase 3 to determine the total cost of existing
communication strategies, from the NHS perspective
by determining the grade of the person involved in
the communication, the time taken and resources
used.Output(s)
The outputs are the following: (i) report describing
current communication practices and (ii) selection of
relevant study sites for phases 2 –3.
Phase 2: Co-design
This phase will consist of implementing the EBCD ap-
proach [ 21,24] in the two study sites selected in phase 1
and will be guided by the EBCD Toolkit3.E B C Di sa n
approach to improving healthcare services that draws on
participatory design and user experience to bring about
quality improvements in healthcare organisations [ 23].
EBCD involves focussing on and designing patient/carer
experiences rather than just systems and processes
[19,24,25]a n d —through a ‘co-design ’process —enables
staff, patients and carers to reflect on their shared experi-
ences of a service and then work together to identify
improvement priorities, devise and implement changes,
and then jointly reflect on their achievements.
In line with the EBCD approach, this phase will in-
clude non-participant observation of staff communicat-
ing the NBS+ result to parents. When the relevant
member of the clinical team contacts the family to com-
municate the initial NBS+ result (by whichever methods
they normally use, e.g. phone or face-to-face), they will
ask the family at the beginning of the interaction,
whether a member of the research team may be present.
If the family agree, a researcher will observe the clinician
communicating the NBS+ result to the family. During
the communication, the researcher will not participate
in the interaction between the clinician and the family
but will take detailed field notes. Semi-structured inter-
views with staff to explore their experiences of commu-
nicating NBS+ to families and then a staff event to
review themes that have arisen and identify priorities

going forward will also be undertaken. Alongside this,
filmed narrative interviews with parents of children who
have received a positive NBS result will be conducted.
This will be followed by a parent event where a compos-
ite film of the narrative interviews will be viewed and
emerging issues and priorities identified. Following the
separate staff and parent events, a mixed staff and parent
event will be held at each site. These will enable joint
priorities for improving delivery of NBS+ results to be
developed using issues highlighted in the film and prior-
ities from the separate staff and parent meetings. The
joint priorities will guide the four co-design working
groups who will meet on three occasions each. During
co-design working group meetings, parents and staff will
work together to co-design the new interventions based
on the jointly identified priorities and following the
EBCD toolkit3.
Participants
Samples sizes for this phase are based on previous
successful EBCD studies [ 20–25]. A purposive sample of
15 staff representing the four CSGs delivering NBS+
results to parents across the two study sites will be the
subjects for the non-participant observation. These staff
will be interviewed about their experiences and invited
to the staff event.
Narrative interviews will be conducted with a purpos-
ive sample of 20 parents representing the four CSGs
who have received a NBS+ result for their child during
the previous 3 –12 months. All parents interviewed will
be invited to the parent event.
The 15 staff and the 20 parents who have been inter-
viewed will be invited to participate in the joint staff and
parent event and the co-design working groups. As per
the EBCD toolkit3, if retention of parents or staff is
problematic at this stage, new participants will be re-
cruited for the co-design work.
Data analysis
Data from observation and interviews with staff will be
pseudonymised; each participant will be allocated a
study code. Data obtained during observation of staff
will be analysed using an inductive approach and themes
will be generated using a manifest/semantic approach
[33] in order to provide a rich description of current
practice.
Staff interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed
verbatim and will be analysed for themes [ 33] to inform
the joint staff/parent meeting and subsequently the co-
design working groups (CDWGs). An inductive ap-
proach to data analysis will be used and themes will be
generated using a latent approach [ 33] to provide adeeper understanding of approaches used to communi-
cate positive NBS results to families. The six phases of
thematic analysis described by Braun and Clarke [ 33]
will guide data analysis. One interview for each of the
CSGs will be coded separately by two members of the
research team (double coded) using NVivo software.
This will aid coding comparisons and inform and align
code development [ 31]. A code book will be developed
based on these comparisons and subsequent discussions
in order to define the codes to be used. This will be an
ongoing, iterative process; new codes may be developed
during data analysis and the definition of codes refined
as analysis progresses [ 32]. Collating codes into potential
themes and reviewing and defining the themes will be
undertaken jointly by the two members of the research
team who generated the initial codes [ 31,33]. Themes
identified from parent interviews will be made into a 30-
min composite film [ 20–25]. The joint staff/parent meet-
ing will generate the priorities that will be focussed upon
by the co-design working groups.
The four CDWGs consisting of parents and staff will
work together on proposed solutions for the identified
priorities3. After each CDWG meeting, ideas generated
by the group will be amalgamated and developed into
protocols to aid implementation during phase 3. At the
next CDWG meeting, the proposed interventions will be
presented to the group so they may continue to work to-
gether to refine their ideas. The final interventions in the
form of protocols will be presented at the final CDWG
meetings to determine if any further tweaks are neces-
sary before they are implemented in phase 3 for testing,
process evaluation and cost analysis.
Output(s)
The output is the co-designed interventions for the four
CSGs developed during the co-designed working group
meetings3.
Phase 3: Testing, process evaluation and cost analysis
It is envisaged that the interventions will involve proced-
ural changes that may include changes to documentation
as well as staff training. The former will involve liaison be-
tween the research team, clinical teams and Public Health
England, via the study support groups. Staff involved in
the delivery of NBS+ results in the study sites will be
trained to implement the new intervention protocols
(developed as a result of the co-designed meetings) for the
four CSGs concurrently. A training manual will be devel-
oped. Members of the research team will visit each study
site and provide clinical teams for the CSGs with two
face-to-face training sessions. Follow-up support will be
provided including resource packs of information to
support the use of the new co-designed interventions in
practice, online resources made available to staff via a3https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/ebcdChudleigh et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:108 Page 6 of 11
study-specific website and remote support via telephone/
email. The face-to-face training will include a didactic ap-
proach but will also include the use of role play. Staff will
be asked to evaluate the training to ensure it has met their
needs and identify areas for improvement. Success criteria
including the acceptability and feasibility of the co-de-
signed interventions will be defined and monitored on a
weekly basis during implementation (Fig. 3).
A parallel process evaluation [ 18] underpinned by
Normalisation Process Theory [ 26,27] will be con-
ducted. Non-participant observation of staff delivering
NBS+ results to parents and semi-structured interviews
with parents and staff will identify healthcare resources
required for delivery of the interventions, staff and
parental experiences and factors that influence imple-
mentation [ 34,35]. These qualitative data will also be
used to determine suitable outcome measures for a
future evaluation study.
An economic analysis will also be conducted. Our ana-
lytical approach will be to undertake a cost analysis of
the intervention coupled with a feasibility study to plan
the economic evaluation that would accompany a defini-
tive evaluation study. The analytical approach that we
envisage using in the definitive study would either be a
cost-utility analysis or a cost-consequence analysis, and
which of these will be most appropriate will be deter-
mined during the present feasibility study. The objec-
tives are to (i) calculate the costs of the current and
newly co-designed communication strategies (using datacollected in phase 3 and phase 1) and (ii) inform the
design of a feasibility study for an economic evaluation
of options to improve delivery of initial NBS+ results to
parents (in phase 4).
To meet the first objective, we will conduct an eco-
nomic analysis to evaluate the NHS costs of the current
and new communication strategies. This will include
training costs, staff costs, and costs of consumables (e.g.
information booklets). For training costs, we will include
costs of the trainer time, training materials, training at-
tendee numbers and time and any other costs associated
with training that might be incurred, such as room hire.
We will identify resource use for each of these items
from training providers and value them using market
prices. For staff costs and consumables associated with
delivery of each communication strategy, we will pro-
duce flow charts for each strategy identifying the main
activities and consumables. We will then produce a pro
forma for each strategy and ask staff delivering the strat-
egies to record the resources used on this pro forma
which will be an electronic document that upon comple-
tion can be emailed directly to the study team. We
envisage the main cost is likely to be staff time, so there-
fore, the pro forma will record the amount of time spent
on different activities and the staff type and grade per-
forming that activity. Staff time and consumables will be
valued using published market prices. The main output
will be a pictorial display (flow chart) of each strategy,
resource use associated with that strategy and its cost.
Fig. 3 Success criteria for testing the co-designed interventions in routine practiceChudleigh et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:108 Page 7 of 11
For the second objective, we will plan the economic
evaluation that would accompany a full evaluation study,
identify potential sources of data and how best to collect
these. Hence, the aim of the economic analysis in the
present study is not to provide a definitive analysis of
the costs, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the
planned interventions as that will not be possible until
the full evaluation study (assuming this is shown to be
feasible).
Participants
Thirty staff involved in delivery of NBS+ results will be
trained to implement the co-designed interventions.
These staff will be observed delivering NBS+ results to
parents using the new co-designed interventions. Twenty
parents who have received a NBS+ result in the previous
3–12 months and 20 staff who have communicated a
NBS+ result to parents in the previous 12 months will
be interviewed. Sample sizes are based on recommenda-
tions and findings regarding pilot and feasibility studies
[36,37] to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment, imple-
mentation and sustainability of the co-designed interven-
tions in practice.
Data analysis
Qualitative data collected during the observation and
semi-structured interviews will be used to identify fac-
tors that influence experiences during the delivery of
NBS+ results. These data will be compared with the
following validated scales: GAD-7 (generalized anxiety
disorder), PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), the
Parenting Stress Index [ 38], EQ5D4(a measure of
health-related quality of life) and the ICECAP-A [ 39]( a
measure of capability for the general adult population
for use in economic evaluations) to determine where
most overlap occurs to inform which outcomes might be
most suitable in a future evaluation study.
Data from the non-participant observation will be ana-
lysed thematically [ 33] following the process described
in phase 2. An inductive approach to data analysis will
be used, and themes will be generated using a manifest
and latent approach [ 33]. These might include the struc-
tures (processes) and use of healthcare resources (type
and time) required for delivery of the interventions, how
parents and staff respond (implementation and mechan-
ism of impact) and how external factors (language
barriers, cultural difference) influence implementation of
the intervention(s) (context) [ 34,35]. All interviews will
be audio-recorded and transcribed. A deductive ap-
proach to thematic analysis will be used, and themes will
be generated using both a manifest and latent approach
as per phase 2 [ 33].For the economic analysis, we will assess the costs of
each communication strategy from an NHS perspective
(i.e. calculate the costs to the NHS of delivering that
strategy). Resource use data for each strategy will be col-
lected as described above and combined with market
prices (unit cost data form published and other sources)
to calculate the total costs associated with each strategy.
Output(s)
The outputs are the following: (i) resource use and cost
of current communication strategies (using data from
phase 1) compared to resource use and costs associated
with the co-designed interventions, (ii) acceptability and
feasibility of the co-designed interventions based on the
success criteria in Fig. 3, and (iii) choice of potential out-
comes measures (GAD 7 PHQ 9 PSI [ 38] EQ5D4and
ICECAP-A [ 39]) for use in a future evaluation study.
Phase 4: Design of future evaluation study
A meeting of key stakeholders (NBS co-ordinators, di-
rectors of NBS Laboratories, health visitors, midwives,
genetic counsellors, parents) will be convened, and the
nominal group technique (NGT) [ 28,29] used to inform
the design of an evaluation study of the co-designed in-
terventions. The NGT was first developed by Delbeq
and Van de Ven [ 40] and consists of a structured meet-
ing consisting of steps during which participants gener-
ate, rate, discuss and then rerate a series of items or
questions to achieve consensus regarding a given topic
[28,29]. In this study, adaptations to the NGT described
in the literature [ 41–43] will be used during the initial
round of idea generation in order to incorporate data
collected during phases 1 –3 of the study. An outline of
the use of the NGT in the study can be seen in Table 2.
Participants
A purposive sample of staff and parents ( n= 10) involved
in phase 2 as well as representatives from relevant char-
ities and members of the research team will be invited.
Data analysis
Qualitative data collated during the NGT will be ana-
lysed using thematic analysis [ 33]. A deductive approach
will be employed, and themes will be generated using a
manifest/sematic approach in order to stay close to the
data. The process described by Braun and Clarke [ 33]
will be followed as described in phase 2, but data will be
jointly coded by two members of the research team
using NVivo software to ensure reliability of coding [ 31].
Quantitative data, such as ranking or rating data, will be

The outcomes are the following: (i) need for and design
of a future evaluation study which may be condition-
dependent and (ii) choice of relevant outcome measures.
Dissemination
We intend to share our study findings on the national
NBS websites so that they may be available to relevant
health professionals involved in the delivery of the initial
positive NBS result. We also plan to share our findings
on the websites of the relevant charities and support
groups associated with these conditions all of whom
have been contacted and provided their endorsement for
this study (CF Trust, Sickle Cell Society, British Thyroid
Foundation, National Society for Phenylketonuria, Meta-
bolic Support UK). We also aim to share our findings at
relevant conferences nationally and internationally. We
will submit our findings to high impact, peer-reviewed
journals including the NIHR HS&DR journal. Parents
involved in the study and those who form the advisory
group will also be sent a summary of the research
findings.
Discussion
This protocol paper describes a national (England) study
to develop co-designed interventions for the communi-
cation of NBS+ results to parents.
An important consideration when designing this study
was the ethical issues associated with researching such a
sensitive topic, i.e. communication of information to
parents regarding life-changing/limiting conditions. Ask-
ing parents to recount the moment they received their
child ’s positive newborn screening result could be
distressing for parents. However, the research team is
highly experienced at working with families in this situ-
ation and will always proceed with due care and sensitiv-
ity. A member of the research team is a Consultant
Clinical Psychologist and will be able to assist and adviseshould a parent become distressed during the interviews. At
the end of each interview and parent/staff meeting and
CDWG meetings, participants will be debriefed. Parents will
also be offered options regarding where they would prefer
t h ei n t e r v i e w st ob ec o n d u c t ed to minimise intrusion.
This study will lead to the development of co-designed
interventions that will meet the needs of parents and
health care professionals and will aim to minimise nega-
tive sequelae associated with communication of NBS+
results. This study will also involve the calculation and
comparison of costs associated with different communi-
cation strategies as well as subsequent use of healthcare
resources. This will include comparisons between costs
of different approaches currently used (from phase 1)
and costs of the new, co-designed interventions in terms
of grade of staff involved, time taken and resources used
(phase 3).
The proposed research may lead to the development
of general evidence-based principles for communicating
positive screening results for children and breaking bad
news. This latter might include conditions that may or
may not be life-altering/threatening but nevertheless can
be distressing for parents, for example, newborn hearing
screening, physical examination of newborn babies in-
cluding congenital cardiac abnormalities, congenital cat-
aracts, cryptorchidism, developmental dislocation of the
hip and findings from screening of children ’s eyes. It
may also be possible to extrapolate findings from the
present study for the delivery of bad news to parents for
children newly diagnosed with cancer or following diag-
nosis of chronic conditions such as diabetes or epilepsy.
In order to monitor the success and progress of the
study, an independent study steering committee, a pro-
ject advisory group and a lay advisory group will be con-
vened at the start of the study and will meet in person
every 6 months for the duration of the study. The re-
search team will also liaise via telephone conference call
monthly for the duration of the study.Table 2 The modified nominal group technique process
(i) Generating ideas Members of the group will be asked to individually consider the data that has been presented to them and consider:
1. If there is there a need for an evaluation study of the co-designed interventions and if so;
2. Ideas for the potential design of an evaluation study of the co-designed interventions.
(ii) Recording ideas Group members engage in a round-robin feedback session to concisely record each idea (without debate).
If it becomes apparent that the consensus is not to proceed to an evaluation study, the NGT will cease at this stage. If
it is decided that an evaluation study should be designed based on the data from phases 1 –3, member of the group
will be asked to share their ideas for the potential design of an evaluation study of the co-designed interventions.
(iii) Clarification A discussion focussed on clarification of the ideas generated.
(iv) Voting Individual group members vote privately to rank ideas. The votes will be tallied to identify the ideas that are rated highest
by the group as a whole and will then be presented back to the group.
(v) Discussion A group discussion to provide further clarification of the highest rated ideas for the future evaluation study of the
co-designed interventions.
(vi) Re-ranking Re-ranking of ideas to determine priorities and future plans.Chudleigh et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:108 Page 9 of 11
The study steering committee will consist of an inde-
pendent Chair, external stakeholders (such as representa-
tives from Public Health England and relevant charities),
relevant methodologists (such as a health economist) and
a clinician. The purpose of this committee will be to pro-
vide advice on aspects of the study to stakeholders, moni-
tor the progress of the study, ensure the rights, well-being
and safety of participants are maintained, ensure appropri-
ate ethical and other approvals are obtained and agree
substantial protocol amendments.
