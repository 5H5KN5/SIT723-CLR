The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight makes children an important tar-
get for health promotion programmes. An intervention was designed for mothers toprovide more vegetables to their daughters ’diet. A randomized controlled trial com-
pared a self-regulation condition with a control condition in 155 mothers aged
25–50 years. Dependent variable was children ’s (aged 6 –11 years) vegetable con-
sumption which was reported by their mothers at three points in time. After baseline(Time 1), the intervention group received theory-based instructional lea ﬂets to pro-
mote self-regulatory skills for providing a healthy nutrition for children. Changes
were assessed after two weeks (Time 2) and at three-month follow-up (Time 3). Theself-regulation intervention in mothers led to an increase in vegetable intake among
their daughters at Time 2 but not at Time 3. However, maintenance of vegetable con-
sumption at Time 3 was mediated by the amount of vegetable intake at Time 2.Engaging mothers in self-regulatory health promotion programmes may be a feasiblestrategy to facilitate more vegetable intake among their daughters.

Introduction
Early dietary interventions within the family environment are an effective strategy for
childhood obesity prevention (Haire-Joshu et al., 2008 ) and for the development of
favourable food attitudes and eating behaviours of children and adolescents (Campbellet al., 2007 ). Golan, Kaufman, and Shahar ( 2006 ) suggested that interventions focusing
on the parent as an agent of dietary change may be effective for in ﬂuencing child die-
tary behaviour. Mothers in comparison to fathers seem to be more concerned about theirchildren ’s diet and have a stronger in ﬂuence on their children ’s eating behaviours
(Johannsen, Johannsen, & Specker, 2006 ). Even if parents have enough information
about health-behaviour recommendations and are motivated to follow a healthy lifestyle,they still need self-regulatory strategies such as planning and self-ef ﬁcacy to translate
their intention into action (Luszczynska, Tryburcy, & Schwarzer, 2007 ; Schwarzer,
2008 ; Wiedemann, Lippke, & Schwarzer, 2012 ).

Aim and hypotheses
We investigated the effect of a self-regulation intervention for mothers on the vegetable
consumption of their primary school daughters. It was hypothesized that mothers in the
intervention group would report higher vegetable intake in their daughters, comparedwith the control group. Moreover, it was expected that the intervention affects planningand self-ef ﬁcacy in the experimental group.
Methods
Participants and procedure
Mothers were invited to a health-promotion programme and attending was voluntary
and without compensation. Exclusion criteria were any medical contraindications withhealth recommendations for vegetable consumption. Of 305 recruited mothers, 155 par-ticipants remained in the analysed sample after attrition over time or due to missing

values (Figure 1). The baseline (Time 1) questionnaires were mailed to participants
assessing socio-demographic factors (e.g. mothers ’age, education, number of children)
and daughters ’vegetable intake. Following the baseline assessment, we randomized the
sample into intervention and control groups, then the intervention group received the
treatment package. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to all participants after two
weeks (Time 2) and three months (Time 3).
The mothers in the longitudinal sample were 25 –50-years old ( M= 34.13 years; SD
= 5.87 years), the majority were educated (33.5% have ﬁnished high school and 41.5%
have a bachelor ’s degree) and married (88.1%). The number of children mostly ranged
from 1 to 3 (13% had 1, 41% had 2 and 23% had 3 children), the age of their daughtersranged from 6 to 11 years.
Measures
At all three measurement points in time, vegetable intake was assessed with an open
answer format: “How many portions of vegetable did your daughter eat on a usual day
during last week? ”One portion was de ﬁned as equivalent to one handful of vegetables.
Planning was measured by two items, Cronbach ’sαfor three points in time were
.74, .77 and .84, respectively.
Self-ef ﬁcacy was measured with two items, Cronbach ’sαwere .89, .94 and .94.
For both planning and self-ef ﬁcacy, responses were rated on a scale ranging from
(1) not at all true to (4) exactly true, using averages as scale scores (adapted from
Schwarzer ( 2008 )).
Intervention and control conditions
In the experimental condition, mothers received a theory-guided lea ﬂet at the end of
their baseline questionnaire. According to the behaviour change technique de ﬁnitions by
Michie et al. ( 2011 ), the intervention consisted of technique 1 (i.e. provide information
on consequences of behaviour in general), with WHO recommendations on healthy
nutrition (WHO, 2002 ) and technique 21 (provide instruction in how to perform the
behaviour). Moreover the intervention included dietary action planning and coping plan-ning exercises (Schwarzer, 2008 ; Stadler, Oettingen, & Gollwitzer, 2010 ; Wiedemann
et al., 2012 ) in line with techniques 7 (action planning), and 8 (barrier identi ﬁcation/
problem solving) (Michie et al., 2011 ).
Results
Intervention effects
Means, standard deviations (SD) and group comparison statistics for vegetable intake
for all measurement points in time are summarized in Table 1.
To examine the intervention effects at Time 2 and Time 3, repeated measures ANO-
VAs were computed. For the dependent variable vegetable intake, a main effect of time
emerged, F(1153) = 4.75, p= .03, η
2= .03, but no treatment effect, F(1153) = .18,
p= .67. An interaction between treatment and time emerged, F(1153) = 5.48, p= .02,
η2= .03, (see Figure 2). As indicated in Table 1, the groups differed signi ﬁcantly at
Time 2 ( MIntervention = 3.09, SD Intervention = 1.86; MControl = 2.53, SD Control = 1.63; t(166)
=−2.07; p= .04), but at Time 3, the difference was no longer signi ﬁcant ( p> .05).Psychology, Health & Medicine 3

For mothers ’planning to feed vegetable to daughters, a main effect of time emerged,
F(1156) = 6.52, p= .01, η2= .03, but no treatment effect, F(1156) = 1.06, p= .30, and no
interaction between treatment and time emerged, F(1156) = 2.09, p= .15.
For mothers ’self-ef ﬁcacy, neither an effect of time nor a treatment effect nor an
interaction between treatment and time emerged.
Mediation analyses
As the intervention effect was only short-term, as seen by increased Time 2 levels vegeta-
ble intake, the question arises whether there might be an indirect effect of the interventionat Time 3. To address this question, Time 2 vegetable intake was considered a putative
mediator between the intervention conditions and vegetable consumption at Time 3.
Figure 3illustrates the mediation model with unstandardized parameters ( Bvalues).
The intervention had a signi ﬁcant effect on Time 2 vegetable intake ( B= .58, p= .03).
Furthermore, Time 1 vegetable intake predicted Time 2 vegetable consumption ( B= .30,
p= .002). There was no direct effect of the intervention on Time 3 vegetable intake
(B= .23, p= .36), controlling for baseline behaviour but a signi ﬁcant indirect effect of
the intervention on Time 3 vegetable consumption through post-intervention vegetableintake ( B= .19, p= .02), indicating a full mediation chain.
Although there was a signi ﬁcant change in planning between mothers in the experi-
mental and control groups, this difference is very small and did not contribute to themediation.
Discussion
This study examined whether a self-regulation intervention on mothers to feed more
vegetable to their daughters would make a difference on vegetable consumption in theirchildren. Results yielded a signi ﬁcant time by treatment interaction for children ’s

vegetable consumption. It was found that mothers receiving the intervention reported
more vegetable intake by their daughters, and the difference was substantial at Time 2.
This ﬁnding is consistent with other studies that have shown improvements in die-
tary behaviours in children by targeting the parents (Tabak, Tate, Stevens, Siega-Riz, &Ward, 2012 ). For example, when interventions targeted parents of preschoolers as the
agents of dietary change, this approach has been effective in in ﬂuencing child dietary
behaviours. These ﬁndings could be supported by Savage, Fisher, and Birch ( 2007 ),
who drew on the observation that parents decide on many aspects of the home environ-
ment and found effects of parental behaviour on health habits of their children. Severalstudies con ﬁrm that making modi ﬁcations to the home environment is effective in
increasing children ’s vegetable intake (Brug, Tak, te Velde, Bere, & de Bourdeaudhuij,
2008 ; Haire-Joshu et al., 2008 ; Williams, Veitch, & Ball, 2011 ).
A further question was whether behaviour change at Time 2 would predict future
behaviour change. To examine this chain mechanism, we speci ﬁed a model where Time
2 behaviour served as a mediator between experimental conditions and Time 3 vegeta-
ble consumption. This chain model has shown that there is a proximal effect that may
trigger subsequent maintenance.
There are some limitations. Assessments were self-reported as no objective mea-
sures were available. Thus, one needs to rely on mothers ’reports on vegetable intake of
their daughters. Future studies should validate such reports against the reports of thechildren and against objective data as well.
Nevertheless, this kind of self-regulatory intervention targeting mothers may serve
as a useful template to design dietary change processes in children; and thus, make a
contribution to the cumulative knowledge about self-regulatory components in health
behaviour change. Future research should examine under which circumstances othermediators or moderators may operate.
