ABSTRACT
Background: Currently no comprehensive meta-analysis of MBI e ﬃcacy
on global and unique cognitive subdomains exist.
Method: Examined the e ﬀects of MBIs on global cognition and 15
cognitive subdomains. Inclusion criteria: meditation naïve participants;randomized controlled trial; outcome included one objective or
subjective cognitive functioning measure; primary focus was teaching
mindfulness skills. Exclusion criteria: inadequate data; one-session ;control condition contained any MBI component. Robust variance
estimation and moderator analyses controlling for presence of
treatment ﬁdelity were conducted.
Results: One-hundred-and-eleven RCTs ( n= 9,538) met eligibility criteria.
MBIs had small-to-moderate signiﬁcant e ﬀects on global cognition,
executive attention, working memory accuracy, inhibition accuracy,
shifting accuracy, sustained attention, and subjective cognitive
functioning (vs. waitlist/no-treatment, g= 0.257 –0.643; vs. active
controls, g= 0.192 –0.394). MBIs did not impact executive functioning
(EF) latency indices, verbal ﬂuency, processing speed, episodic memory,
and cognitive error. Treatment e ﬀects were stronger for those with
elevated psychiatric symptoms vs. healthy controls, and medicalsamples, studies with complete-case (vs. intention-to-treat) analysis,
face-to-face (vs. self-guided) delivery, and non-standard (vs. standard
MBI).Conclusion: MBIs consistently yielded small-to-moderate yet practically
meaningful e ﬀect sizes on global cognition and six cognitive
subdomains that captured accuracy vs. latency-based indices of EF andsustained accuracy.ARTICLE HISTORY

Mindfulness is described as the intentional practice of non-judgmentally focusing on experiences in
the here and now in ﬂexible, curious, and receptive ways (Bishop et al., 2004 ). Originating from Bud-
dhist philosophies and meditative practices, abundant scienti ﬁc evidence has shown that mindful-
ness-based interventions (MBIs) positively a ﬀect various health outcomes across diverse age
groups, genders, and people living in di ﬀerent cultural contexts (Abbott et al., 2014 ; Black &
Slavich, 2016 ; Flook et al., 2015 ; Kaunhoven & Dorjee, 2017 ; Wetherell et al., 2017 ). Advancing our
understanding of potential mechanisms via which mindfulness confers bene ﬁts is thus essential.
Mindfulness can improve executive functioning (EF),1which involves higher cognitive control func-
tions. MBIs teach focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM) exercises to enhance EF abilities

(Stein & Witkiewitz, 2020 ). FA training involves sustaining attention to a particular object or aspect of
experience and continually re-focusing after distractions (An ālayo, 2019a ). OM practices involve non-
judgmental and non-elaborative awareness (Uusberg et al., 2016 ), cultivating non-reactivity to cog-
nitive and emotional content (An ālayo, 2019b ). These processes are plausible distinct mechanisms
via which FA and OM may bene ﬁt EF domains.
Further, FA exercises might bene ﬁtworking memory (WM; Corbetta & Shulman, 2002 ). Practicing
FA and OM has been theorised to positively impact WM by continually updating information (Jha
et al., 2019 ; Miyake et al., 2000 ; Vago et al., 2019 ). The positive in ﬂuence of OM on emotion regulation
abilities might also enhance WM capacity through meta-cognitive processes (Lutz et al., 2015 ;
Raﬀone et al., 2019 ).
In addition, practicing FA could enhance the ability to shift between thinking modes and inhibit
autopilot responses. Shifting involves ﬂuently switching back and forth between di ﬀerent thinking
modes (Berg, 1948 ; Chiu et al., 2018 ;R aﬀone & Srinivasan, 2017 ), whereas inhibition refers to the
eﬀortful refraining from autopilot responses (Jewsbury et al., 2016 ). These bene ﬁts of FA are
especially evident when attention is directed away from unhelpful thoughts toward the present
moment and task at hand (Wolkin, 2015 ).
On that note, mindfulness practices might enhance attentional control (Sorensen et al., 2018 ), a
foundational precursor to EF (Vilgis et al., 2015 ). For instance, it has been proposed that MBIs can
improve meta-cognition and attentional facets (Haigh et al., 2010 ), such as sustained attention accu-
racy (Esterman & Rothlein, 2019 ) and intra-individual coe ﬃcient of variation (Bellgrove et al., 2004 ;
Cubillo et al., 2023 ).Sustained attention has also been de ﬁned as alerting (Prakash et al., 2020 ),
and recurrently identifying distracting thoughts could buttress the salience attentional control sub-
domain linked to the identi ﬁcation of or goal-driven ﬁxation on speciﬁ c visual or physical cues (Awh
et al., 2012 ; Seeley et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, mindfulness practices can improve orienting (orselective
attention ) ability by redirecting attention back to the task at hand (Ristic et al., 2007 ; Sood & Jones,
2013 ). Also, MBIs may enhance executive attention by managing con ﬂicting thoughts, emotions, and
responses (Petersen & Posner, 2012 ). Taken together, these theories propose that MBI skills may
enhance attention domains through observation, discernment, psychological ﬂexibility strategies,
and increased awareness of in ﬂuential factors (Cubillo et al., 2023 ; Garland et al., 2015 ).
MBIs could impact various cognitive functioning domains beyond EF and attentional constructs.
For example, they might enhance verbal ﬂuency by improving the ability to verbalize internal experi-
ences and external events using precise and expressive language (Baer et al., 2004 ). Relatedly, MBIs
could reduce cognitive errors and distractions during task engagement by reducing repetitive nega-
tive thinking, such as worry and rumination (Gu et al., 2015 ; Lindsay & Creswell, 2017 ; Posner et al.,
2015 ; Teper et al., 2013 ). Such processes could free up more cognitive resources to attend to and
process incoming information, improving processing speed (Müller et al., 2021 ) and episodic
memory (Allen & Fortin, 2013 ; Tulving, 2002 ). Additionally, increased acceptance, awareness, and
quality of engagement through MBIs might enhance subjective cognitive functioning (Daglas-Geor-
giou et al., 2022 ; Hallion et al., 2019 ; Lindsay & Creswell, 2017 ) and objective cognitive functioning
(Fisher et al., 2019 ; Teper & Inzlicht, 2013 ). Collectively, MBIs could re ﬁne speci ﬁc cognitive subdo-
mains and global cognition by freeing up limited resources and enabling e ﬀective and e ﬃcient
use
of them.
To date, only six meta-analyses focused solely on RCTs of MBIs examining cognitive
functioning outcomes. For example, across 13 RCTs ( n= 1,112), MBIs had substantial, moderate
eﬀects on WM and inhibition but a negligible impact on shifting among adults (Cásedas et al.,
2020 ). In children and adolescents, across 17 studies ( n= 1,762), MBIs led to small but meaningful
eﬀects on attentional control and global EF (e.g., planning, WM; Dunning et al., 2019 ). Also, seven
RCTs ( n= 170) found positive impacts of MBIs (vs. controls) on attention and episodic memory
among persons with multiple sclerosis (Han, 2021 ). Relatedly, across 27 RCTs ( n= 1,632), MBIs had
small yet signi ﬁcant eﬀ ects on attention and global EF, but not WM, among healthy adults ages
18–65 (Yakobi et al., 2021 ). However, these reviews did not consistently examine the e ﬀects of2 N. H. ZAINAL AND M. G. NEWMAN
MBIs on EF facets and executive attention. Also, data synthesised across nine studies ( n= 724)
showed that MBIs did not notably impact attention, EF, memory, and global cognition in adults
aged 60 years and above (Sanchez-Lara et al., 2021 ). Most recently, across 56 independent studies
(n= 2,931), MBIs displayed superior eﬀ ects on global cognition, EF, and WM, compared to no-treat-
ment but not active controls (Whit ﬁeld et al., 2022 ).
Overall, previous reviews had several gaps that the current meta-analysis was designed to ﬁll.
First, beyond methodological limitations related to most of them, such as including uncontrolledor non-randomised studies, only two (Verhaeghen, 2021 ; Whit ﬁeld et al., 2022 ) tested if MBIs
exerted di ﬀerential eﬀ ects on attentional control subdomains –alerting (or sustained attention),
orienting, and executive attention. These attentional control domains should be examined separ-ately as MBIs could in ﬂuence them di ﬀerently, given that they are neurologically dissociable
despite their inter-connectedness (Posner & Rothbart, 2007 ). Further, prior MBI meta-analyses that
examined moderators (Im et al., 2021 ; Verhaeghen, 2021 ) tended to test their eﬀ ects only on
global cognition. Since moderator eﬀ ect sizes might be domain-speci ﬁc, the currentir meta-analysis
can provide more information by testing potential treatment and moderator e ﬀects on di ﬀerent cog-
nitive domain outcomes. In addition, to our awareness, no reviews have investigated whether MBIsinﬂuenced processing speed, subjective cognitive functioning, and cognitive error, despite the the-
ories above suggesting those possibilities. Also, it may be helpful to test the e ﬀects of MBIs on both
objective (performance-based) cognitive functioning domains and subjective (self-reported) atten-tional control, as these aspects of cognitive functioning might not align (Vago et al., 2019 ; Van
Dam et al., 2018 ). Doing so also permits examining if MBIs a ﬀected accuracy –more than latency-
based markers of EF.
Additionally, no prior reviews have investigated whether instructor-led face-to-face (vs. self-
guided) MBIs were more potent at changing cognitive outcomes. This question is becoming more
important given the recent rise in mostly low-intensity self-help digital MBIs (Mrazek et al., 2019 ),
highlighting the importance of determining their e ﬀectiveness in improving brain health on a
broader scale. Relatedly, most prior meta-analyses have not tested if gender, study quality, retentionpercentage, and complete-case (vs. intent-to-treat; ITT) analyses would moderate the impact of MBIs
on cognitive functioning. Such eﬀ orts are necessary to determine under which conditions MBIs
would be of bene ﬁt. Also, as lack of attention to treatment integrity is a ﬁeld-wide major limitation
concerning the state of science on this topic (Crane & Hecht, 2018a ), our meta-analysis adds to prior
ones by including the presence of reported treatment ﬁdelity
checks as a covariate. In addition,
whereas most prior meta-analyses had restricted age ranges, we tested the main and interaction
treatment eﬀ ects of MBIs on cognitive functioning across the lifespan. Also, we examined only
MBI RCTs and included 95 (Cásedas et al., 2020 ), 84 (Yakobi et al., 2021 ), and 55 (Whitﬁ eld et al.,
2022 ) more studies than recent RCT-focused ones.
Most importantly, our eﬀ orts thus oﬀ er a more accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date review,
particularly by examining the impact of MBIs on pre –post global cognition and 15 cognitive func-
tioning domains and MBI eﬀ ects on pre-follow-up global cognition. These 15 cognitive subdomains
are essential to study as separate MBI outcomes as they contribute to daily functioning, well-being,
and task performance and could mitigate the risk for or target issues related to cognitive disorders(e.g., attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dementia), and improve clinical outcomes
(Braenden et al., 2023 ; Lenze et al., 2022 ). The upshot is that understanding the potential and
limits of MBIs to enhance these 15 cognitive subdomains may advance psychological sciences viapositive cumulative personal and societal impacts.
Considering the above, an up-to-date systematic quantitative review was conducted to syn-
thesise 111 RCTs ( n= 9,538) to assess the strength of the eﬀ ect of MBIs on global cognition and
the following unique cognitive subdomains: orienting, executive attention, WM accuracy and
latency, inhibition accuracy and latency, shifting accuracy and latency, sustained attention (accuracy
or intra-individual coe ﬃcient of variation), subjective cognitive functioning, processing speed,
verbal ﬂuency, episodic memory, and cognitive error. We selected these 15 subdomainsHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 3
because there was su ﬃcient RCT literature to conduct a meta-analysis. Doing so can catalyse
future eﬀ orts to advance the ﬁeld on this topic by examining the eﬀ ects of MBIs on other under-
studied cognitive subdomains, such as decision-making (Fernando et al., 2016 ; Kirk et al., 2016 ),
inductive reasoning (Shapiro et al., 2012 ), language (Dickinson et al., 2016 ), and delay discounting
(MacKillop et al., 2011 ). Moreover, as previous reviews arrived at varying conclusions, this systema-
tic review tested factors that may have moderated the strength of the e ﬀect of MBIs on unique
cognitive subdomains.

Search terms and databases
This meta-analysis was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Moher et al., 2009 ) and was registered with the International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; #CRD42020220576; https://tinyurl.com/5bhrmnub ).
We de ﬁned eligibility criteria and methods before the search and selection process and continually
documented these steps in a study protocol. Relevant studies were identi ﬁed by searching ﬁve data-
bases (ScienceDirect, PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library). Search dates
included all articles that met eligibility criteria from January 1989 to December 2022. We used the
following keyword combinations: ‘mindful*, ’or ‘mindful* training ’or ‘meditation ’and ‘cognition, ’
‘attention,’‘ executive attention,’‘ cognitive control, ’‘shifting, ’‘switching,’‘ inhibition, ’‘inhibitory
control, ’‘cognitive ﬂexibility, ’‘working memory, ’‘verbal ﬂuency ’and ‘randomised controlled trial ’
or ‘RCT. ’Further, we systematically searched through reference sections of articles pertinent to
our research question and eligible studies. To reduce the odds of publication bias (i.e., ﬁle drawer
problem; Rosenthal, 1979 ), we included unpublished master ’s theses and doctoral dissertations
that met eligibility criteria. Moreover, we searched for potentially eligible articles via PsyArXiv Pre-
prints and requested eligible data from pertinent society listservs.
Screening process
Eligibility criteria included: (1) sample comprised meditation naïve participants; (2) random assign-ment to MBIs vs. no-treatment, waitlist, or active control; (3) administration of at least one behav-
ioural, cognitive assessment, or subjective cognitive functioning measure at baseline and post-
treatment; (4) teaching mindfulness skills was the primary focus of treatment (Creswell, 2017 ).
Speciﬁcally, MBIs had to include psychoeducation and FA and/or OM skills delivery. (5) MBIs had
to include at least two sessions (note that number of sessions was also examined as a moderator).Also, homework was prescribed.
We excluded studies if: (1) data was inadequate to calculate e ﬀect sizes; (2) they used acceptance
and commitment therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, integrative mind –body training, loving-kind-
ness meditation, neurofeedback mindfulness training, mantra-based training, hatha yoga, or mindful-ness-oriented yoga, self-compassion training, were augmented with aromatherapy or (3) a control
condition contained any form of MBIs or MBI components (see Figure 1 for PRISMA ﬂowchart).
Coding procedures
We double-coded studies ( k= 111) for participant attributes (e.g., age, percentage of female), clinical
status (i.e., healthy control (HC), participants with elevated psychiatric symptoms (PSY) or medical/
physical illness symptoms (MED)), treatment attributes (e.g., number of sessions, number of
session hours), active (cognitive –behavioural therapy (CBT), cognitive training, psychoeducation-
only, or treatment-as-usual (TAU) that involved some intervention) vs. no treatment or waitlist
control condition, self-guided vs. teacher-led, standard (de ﬁned as MBSR or MBCT) vs. non-standard4 N. H. ZAINAL AND M. G. NEWMAN
MBI, study attributes (study quality, presence of ﬁdelity checks, retention percentage), and cognitive
function outcome attributes. The ﬁrst author coded and extracted data from all studies. A second
coder from a research team of 16 members also independently coded for reliability. All coders under-
went a standardised and rigorous training protocol that involved a mixture of didactics, regular
meetings, consultations, and literature reviews. Discrepancies were resolved via regular discussion,
and coders reached an agreement regarding a ﬁnal set of codes.
Study quality
We evaluated study quality based on an adapted version of the Delphi criteria (Verhagen et al., 1998 ).
The modi ﬁed criteria were: (1) randomisation conducted, (2) individuals in both conditions wereFigure 1. PRISMA ﬂowchart summarising the study identi ﬁcation, screening, and selection process.

demographically alike, (3) eligibility criteria de ﬁned, (4) experimenters who administered cognitive
function measures were uninformed of treatment allocation, (5) su ﬃcient descriptive statistics
(e.g., mean and standard deviations at all periods) were reported or available upon request to
compute eﬀ ect sizes for pre-to-post treatment changes, (6) ITT analysis used. Ful ﬁlling each criterion
received one point (vs. a zero). The Delphi score thus ranged from 0 to 6. In addition, this Delphi
score study quality rating was used in the moderator analysis. We also assessed study quality
using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias instrument (Higgins et al., 2011 ).
Measurement properties
Cognitive data were coded for global cognition and 15 cognitive subdomains: orienting, executive
attention, WM accuracy or latency, inhibition accuracy or latency, shifting accuracy or latency, sus-
tained attention (accuracy or intra-individual coe ﬃcient of variation), subjective cognitive function-
ing, processing speed, verbal ﬂuency, episodic memory, and cognitive error. Table 1 in the main
manuscript and Table S1 in the online supplemental materials (OSM) provide information on thedeﬁnitions of global cognition, the 15 cognitive subdomains examined in the current meta-analysis,
and the di ﬀerent types of tests classi ﬁed in each cognitive subdomain. The OSM also details the
speciﬁ c measures used for each cognitive subdomains and their psychometric properties.
Planned analyses
All analyses were conducted in RVersion 4.0.1. Inter-rater agreement was established with the irr
package in R(Gamer et al., 2007 ). The Rpackages robumeta (Fisher et al., 2017 ),metafor (Viechtbauer,
2010 ), and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016 ) were used to examine treatment eﬀ ects, study heterogeneity,
outliers, and publication bias and to create funnel and forest plots. Rsyntax of analyses is available
on Open Science Framework.
Reliability
We established inter-rater agreement by computing two-way intra-class correlation coe ﬃcients
(ICCs) for continuous variables (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979 ) and unweighted Cohen ’s kappa ( κ) for all
binary or nominal variables (Hallgren, 2012 ).
Eﬀect sizes
Due to the diversity of studies, such as the varying number of treatment comparators (1 –2) and cog-
nitive outcome measures, we applied a random e ﬀects model (Borenstein et al., 2009 ). Further, we
used robust variance estimation (RVE) with small sample adjustments to account for the non-inde-pendence of eﬀ ect sizes clustered within the same samples and for studies with multiple treatment
comparators (Tanner-Smith et al., 2016 ). Moreover, these RVE approaches produced e ﬀect size and
95% conﬁ dence interval (CI) estimates that accounted for e ﬀect size dependency. E ﬀect sizes were
coded such that higher values signi ﬁed better cognitive outcomes between the treatment and
control groups.
Based on random-e ﬀects models using pre- and post-treatment data between groups, we com-
puted Hedge ’sgto obtain accurate and unbiased parameter estimates (e.g., correcting for biases due
to small sample size) to calculate pre-post e ﬀect sizes. As the pre- and post- correlation were not
obtainable, we used a conservative estimate ( r= .50) representative of the retest reliability of cogni-
tive functioning tasks reported in the literature to date (Dai et al., 2019 ; Hedge et al., 2018 ). A similar
approach was used for global cognition to calculate pre-follow-up treatment e ﬀect sizes (MBIs vs.
waitlist or no-treatment and MBIs vs. active controls).
2We controlled for the presence of reported
treatment ﬁdelity checks in all eﬀ ect size analyses.
We also contacted 15 authors for these descriptive statistics. Of these, nine responded. When
we could not obtain the descriptive statistics, other inferential statistics (e.g., p,t,F) that6 N. H. ZAINAL AND M. G. NEWMAN
Table 1. Deﬁnition of unique cognitive functioning subdomains and their speci ﬁc tests.
Episodic Memory: Capacity to correctly recall previous events, facts, and information with their situational context ( Allen & Fortin,
2013 ;Tulving, 2002 ).
CVLT-LDFR (Delis et al., 2017 ): Participants received instructions to listen and recall words on a 16-item list following each of the
ﬁve learning trials. Following a distractor list, participants were again instructed to retrieve words verbally spontaneously (short
delay-free recall) (SDFR) and with categorical cues. After the longer delay, participants underwent a yes/no recognition trial that
required them to di ﬀerentiate between the target words in the prior 16-item list and 32-item distractor list. The CVLT-LDFR
score could range from 0 to 16.
Attentional Control :Basic ability to regulate mental focus on tasks consistent with a desired aim (Sorensen et al., 2018 ).
Attentional Control –Executive Attention: Ability to skilfully manage responses in the face of con ﬂicting thoughts,
emotions, and responses or con ﬂict monitoring ( Petersen & Posner, 2012 ).
ANT –Executive attention (Fan et al., 2002 ; Posner et al., 2015 ): Participants had to classify as rapidly and accurately as possible
if the central (target) arrow pointed left or right on double cue trials where ﬂanker arrows pointed in the same direction
(congruent trials) or opposite direction (incongruent trials). Executive control was computed by subtracting the average RT ofcongruent trials from the average RT of incongruent trials such that large positive scores signi ﬁed poorer executive attention.
Attentional Control –Orienting: Honing focus on an object amid diverse sensory input or selective attention (Ristic et al.,
2007 ;Sood & Jones, 2013 ).
ANT –Orienting (Fan et al., 2002 ; Posner et al., 2015 ): Refer to the description above. Orienting was computed by subtracting the
average RT on spatial cue trials from the average RT on centre cue trials (both trials informed participants on target onset, butthey received cues of spatial orienting only on spatial-cue trials).
Executive Functioning (EF): Higher complex cognitive control functions responsible for governing cognitive and
behavioural processes.
Inhibitory Control: Ability to refrain from autopilot response tendencies e ﬀortfully ( Jewsbury et al., 2016 ).
Stroop test (Stroop, 1935 ): Participants viewed matrices of colour-words printed in blue, red, and green ink that were either
congruent (e.g., ‘red ’word with red ink) or incongruent (e.g., ‘red ’word with blue ink) and were asked to name the ink colour as
rapidly and accurately as possible. RT and task accuracy were documented for this test.
Set-Shifting: Capacity
 to switch back and forth between distinct thinking modes ﬂuently ( Berg, 1948 ;Chiu et al., 2018 ).
WCST (Grant & Berg, 1948 ): Participants were given four stimulus cards (mixture of shapes, colours, and numbers) across up to 64
or 128 trials for 10 –20 min. Per the instructions, they sorted the cards based on speci ﬁc rules (i.e., shape, colour, or number)
across trials and received feedback during each trial on whether their choice was correct or wrong.
Working Memory (WM): Adeptness to continually monitor environmental input and replace out-of-date information with
new information ( Jha et al., 2019 ;Miyake et al., 2000 ;Vago et al., 2019 ).
N-Back Task (Kane et al., 2007 ; Owen et al., 2005 ): Participants were instructed to retain information for a speci ﬁc stimulus.
Further, when a new stimulus substituted the most prior one, the WM should have updated the information. The count ofaccurate responses and RT were indicators of WM performance. Similar variants of the n-back tasks used in previous MBI RCTsexist (e.g., NIH-EXAMINER; Kramer et al., 2014 ).
Verbal Fluency: Capacity to generate as many relevant words based on a cue (e.g., semantic category, letter) within a time
limit ( Henry & Crawford, 2004 ;Raucher-Chéné et al., 2017 ).
COWAT –Phonemic (Benton & Hampsher, 1978 ): Participants had to name as many unique words within 1 min based on a
phonemic cue (e.g., the letter ‘F,’‘A,’or‘S.’).
Subjective Cognitive Functioning: Perception of the degree individualsbelieved in their capacity to stay focused on task,
process information, memorise facts, and exercise other cognitive functioning faculties (Daglas-Georgiou et al., 2022 ;
Hallion et al., 2019 ).
ACS (Derryberry & Reed, 2002 ; Judah et al., 2014 ): Participants rated their perception of how well they could generally focus on
the task at hand and ﬂexibly shift attention between di ﬀerent tasks.
Sustained Attention Accuracy: Degree of correctness and consistency with staying on-task (Esterman & Rothlein, 2019 ).
Sustained attention has also been de ﬁned as alerting (essential arousal or awareness of objects; Prakash et al., 2020 ).
CPT (Corbett
 et al., 2009 ; MacLean et al., 2010 ): Participants received instructions to focus on the screen, saw one integer appear
on the screen at a time, and had to press the spacebar when a speci ﬁc number (e.g., the integer ‘6’) or letter (e.g., ‘K’or‘X’)
appeared. In the AX-CPT version (Braver, 2012 ; Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996 ), participants were told to o ﬀer a target response to
an ‘X’probe after an ‘A’cue and to o ﬀer a non-target response for other kinds of non-target trials: cue ‘A’and subsequently a
‘non-X ’probe letter (i.e., ‘AY’ trial); a ‘non-A ’and subsequently an ‘X’probe letter (i.e., BX trial); and a ‘non-A ’cue and
subsequently a ‘non-X ’probe letter (i.e., ‘BY ’trial). Higher number of accurate responses indicated better sustained attention
ability.
Intra-Individual Coe ﬃcient of Variation: Degree of variability in oﬀering accurate responses on sustained attention tasks
(Bellgrove et al., 2004 ;Cubillo et al., 2023 ).
DART (Dockree et al., 2006 ; Robertson et al., 1997 ): Participants underwent procedures similar to the SART with the addition of a
CPT to enhance the sensitivity of capturing sustained attention in healthy adults. Higher RT coe ﬃcient of variation (CV) for
white integers denoted poorer overall DART performance.
Processing Speed: Degree of task completion e ﬃciency ( Muller et al., 2021 ).
LDST (Lezak
et al., 2012 ; Smith, 1982 ; van der Elst et al., 2006 ): This assessment was adapted from earlier substitution tests, i.e.,
the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). The DSST required participants toattend to a symbol-letter key and to write down the matching symbol beneath each digit in a blank space. In contrast,instructions for SDMT were reversed (i.e., participants received instructions to write down the matching number).Simultaneously, participants could also verbalise answers for the DSST. The LDST di ﬀered from earlier versions by including

permitted computing eﬀ ect sizes based on pre-and post-treatment values (i.e., condition × time
interaction) were calculated following recommendations by the Cochrane Collaboration
(Higgins & Green, 2011 ). Eﬀect sizes based on change scores (vs. post-treatment scores) are
less a ﬀected by possible baseline di ﬀerences (Johnsen & Friborg, 2015 ). Sampling variance was
computed as the sum of variances for the treatment group and control group (Morris &
DeShon, 2002 , p. 117).
Outliers
Outliers were de ﬁned as eﬀ ect sizes with studentized deleted residuals more than ± 1.96 and Cook ’s
distance greater than the 50th percentile (Viechtbauer & Cheung, 2010 ). Sensitivity analyses tested if
results remained the same with and without outlier(s).3Allﬁndings in the current manuscript
excluded outliers, as outliers estimate the population average as distinct from the average calculated
from remaining eﬀ ect sizes. In total, six outliers were deleted.
Study heterogeneity
To assess e ﬀect size heterogeneity, we used the I2and Qstatistic. I2represents the degree of het-
erogeneity of the true observed dispersion due to between-study variability instead of within-
study sampling error. I2values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered small, moderate, and
large, respectively (Higgins et al., 2003 ). A statistically signi ﬁcant Qstatistic suggests that variability
around the average eﬀ ect size is higher than would be solely predicted from sampling error
(Cochran, 1954 ). Importantly, signi ﬁcant heterogeneity was required before conducting moderator
analyses.
Publication bias
We assessed publication bias using the p-uniform test (van Assen et al., 2015 ) and inspected the
funnel plots. Funnel plots illustrate publication bias by mapping each study ’seﬀect size with its stan-
dard error, such that more signi ﬁcant asymmetry indicates more risk of bias. Figures S3a to S19b in
the OSM provide funnel plots for all cognitive outcomes.

present in 64% of studies comparing MBIs to waitlist and no-treatment and 65% of studies compar-
ing MBIs with active controls.
Sample characteristics
Tables S2 and S3 present study characteristics. Collectively, they included 9,538 participants with an
average age of 33.98 years ( SD= 20.05, range = 3.92 –80.61, and of which 57.85% were female). The
sample size ranged from 14 to 424, and the mean sample size was 84. Number of sessions rangedfrom 2 to 90 ( M= 57.85, SD= 19.81). RCTs were conducted across 22 nations, most in the United
States ( k= 46, 41.44%). Forty-one out of 111 studies (36.94%) reported ethnicity, and in these
studies, 60.93% of participants identi ﬁed as White. No studies reported sexual orientation/gender
identity. Concerning socioeconomic status, six studies recruited participants with low income andthree with low socioeconomic status. Across the ﬁve studies that reported income ﬁgures, mean
annual income ranged from $50,000 to $124,000. Also, the number of e ﬀect sizes for each indepen-
dent study sample ranged from 1 to 39, with a mean of 6 e ﬀect sizes per study.

such as multiple imputation or other reasonable data replacement strategies (e.g., full information
maximum likelihood) were taken. However, no studies showed a high risk of bias due to missingdata. In addition, some concerns emerged in 3.64% of the studies wherein assessors were aware10 N. H. ZAINAL AND M. G. NEWMAN

Discussion
Overall e ﬀects of MBIs on global cognition and 15 cognitive subdomains
Our novel meta-analysis of 111 RCTs observed that MBIs had small-to-moderate e ﬀects on global
cognition, executive attention, WM accuracy, inhibition accuracy, shifting accuracy, sustained atten-tion, and subjective cognitive functioning. These ﬁndings were true compared to no-treatment and
waitlist (average g=0.249 –0.644) and active controls (average g=0.192 –0.394), even after adjustingHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 13
for treatment ﬁdelity in all analyses. Here, we mainly focus on the eﬀ ects with active controls as com-
parators since these trials o ﬀer a more accurate and precise answer to the inquiry of whether MBIs
improve cognitive functioning as compared to other treatments. Moreover, in interpreting the
ﬁndings, we highlight that no evidence for a signi ﬁcant eﬀ ect between MBIs and any control
does not equal evidence for no eﬀ ect. Also, we observed zero publication bias based on the p-
uniform test and funnel plots, thus o ﬀering con ﬁdence in the validity of our ﬁndings and inferences
drawn on how MBIs impact cognitive functioning, as detailed below.
Encouragingly, our results imply that in these domains, MBI-delivered skills were more potent
than those imparted by active controls. However, as MBIs did not diﬀ er from controls in impacting
nine out of 15 subdomains and signi ﬁcant eﬀ ect sizes were small in the other domains, researchers
and clinicians should exercise caution concerning MBIs ’beneﬁcial eﬀ ects on these nonsigni ﬁcant
domains, i.e., conclusions other researchers have drawn (e.g., Noone & Hogan, 2018 ; Van Dam
et al., 2018 ). Meaningful inferences drawn from these ﬁndings include how the eﬀ ect of MBIs on
improved self-regulation (Tang et al., 2015 ) and reduced mind wandering (Mrazek et al., 2013 )
might be partly accounted for by the six speciﬁ c cognitive domains serving as theoretical mechan-
isms of change. Potential policy and related applied implications based on these outcomes include
the bene ﬁts of teaching mindfulness skills in primary care, specialist clinics (Elices et al., 2022 ),
schools (Fulambarkar et al., 2023 ), and workplaces (Pérez-Fuentes et al., 2020 ) on speciﬁ c cognitive
domains for students, employees, and other stakeholders. Enhancements in speci ﬁc cognitive func-
tioning domains might also translate to better focus, resilience, and decision-making skills in govern-mental and related leadership settings (Oman, 2023 ).
Noteworthy is that the eﬀ ect of MBIs on global cognition might be mainly attributable to signi ﬁ-
cant eﬀ ects on six speciﬁ c cognitive subdomains. This possibility is based on evidence that substan-
tial correlations exist between global cognition and these cognitive subdomains (Biagianti et al.,
2019 ; Coors et al., 2022 ). Important implications and meaning of these ﬁndings are that targeting
these six speci ﬁc
cognitive functioning domains via MBIs is probably more e ﬃcient than trying to
enhance other cognitive functioning domains in various applied settings, such as clinics, govern-ment, schools, and workplaces.
Relatedly, the ﬁnding that MBIs’ impact on global cognition extended across time, in addition
to evidence showing that MBIs had post-treatment e ﬀects that impacted cognition beyond atten-
tion measures (i.e., global cognition, executive attention, WM, inhibition accuracy, shifting accu-
racy), bolsters theoretical propositions that MBIs yield long-term persistent e ﬀects (Malinowski &
Shalamanova, 2017 ), and lead to generalisation of skills to tasks, objects, or contents beyond
the ones practiced. Moreover, results that treatment e ﬀect sizes did not substantially di ﬀer
between measures of attentional control and EF vs. other cognitive subdomains might providemore evidence for such viewpoints. Collectively, the topic of the bene ﬁt of MBIs on speciﬁ c cog-
nitive functioning subdomains over extended periods deserves more investigation. Our currentmeta-analysis was only well-powered to examine global cognition at follow-up, but not otherunique cognitive subdomains. More importantly, these outcomes highlight the importance of
relaying the long-term bene ﬁts of practicing mindfulness on global cognition when evaluating
the policy impact of disseminating MBIs. For instance, any population-level long-term e ﬃcacy of
MBIs on well-being, as evidenced by prior research (Grossman et al., 2007 ), might be due to
improved global cognition.
Mixed e ﬀects of MBIs
Attentional control constructs
Findings that MBIs improved executive attention, intra-individual coe ﬃcient of variation, and sus-
tained attention accuracy concur with theories positing that MBIs boost unwavering focus and
non-judgmental acceptance over time (Bishop et al., 2004 ). Assessing multiple sustained attention
indices is essential to understand how MBIs enhance attentional stability. Moreover, our ﬁndings14 N. H. ZAINAL AND M. G. NEWMAN
aligned with recent evidence that meditation practices enhanced accuracy instead of latency-based
indices of attentional control components over time (Sumantry & Stewart, 2021 ). Essential clinical
and educational implications include the potential to help youths and adults with ADHD and
related attentional disorders via MBIs, as suggested by recent theories (Cairncross & Miller, 2020 ).
The upshot is that MBIs promote attentional health aspects of mental well-being(i.e., the state of
a person ’s attentional capacity or functioning; Stark & Cimprich, 2003 ).
Intriguingly, MBIs (vs. active controls) improved executive attention but were not substantially
diﬀerent when targeting orienting aspects of attentional control. These ﬁndings support recent for-
mulations (Prakash et al., 2020 ) about the speciﬁceﬀects of MBIs on di ﬀerent attentional control
facets. Theories suggesting that MBIs promote executive attention by reducing mind wandering,attentional lapses, and emotional distractions (Good et al., 2015 ; Hölzel et al., 2011 ; Lin et al.,
2019 ; Vago & Silbersweig, 2012 ) could account for these ﬁndings. Conversely, ﬁndings of no evi-
dence of MBI (vs. control) eﬀ ects on orienting were surprising since MBIs instruct selective attention
for some exercises, such as body scans and focused imagery, and adopting a ‘decentred ’stance for
other exercises (e.g., nonjudgment; Bishop et al., 2004 ; Sumantry & Stewart, 2021 ; Verhaeghen,
2021 ). Note that the absence of evidence of an intervention e ﬀect does not imply evidence of the
absence of such an intervention e ﬀect (Gelman & Stern, 2006 ; Harms & Lakens, 2018 ). An interven-
tion eﬀ ect of MBIs on orienting may exist but may require a long-term commitment to mindfulness
practices (Isbel & Mahar, 2015 ; Lodha & Gupta, 2022 ) or other MBI modalities (Green & Bavelier, 2003 )
to enhance the orienting subdomain. Mixed prior ﬁndings of positive eﬀ ects in one study (e.g., Jha
et al., 2007 ) but null eﬀ ects of MBIs on orienting in another (Felver et al., 2017 ) also possibly suggest
heterogeneity of treatment eﬀ ects (Kent et al., 2020 ) and the importance of discovering for whom
MBIs confer bene ﬁcial eﬀ ects on the orienting subdomain. However, these potential accounts
require precise empirical testing, preferably by using experiments and random assignment
among
diverse groups.
EF constructs
There was no evidence of MBI (vs. control) eﬀ ects on WM, inhibition, shifting latencies, and proces-
sing speed. Overall, results suggest that MBIs primarily impacted cognitive processing eﬀectiveness
(captured by accuracy) more than eﬃ ciency (measured by latency) and o ﬀer only partial support for
the viewpoint that MBIs promote both aspects of cognitive function (Jang et al., 2018 ;R aﬀone & Sri-
nivasan, 2017 ). Nonsigni ﬁcant di ﬀerence on eﬃ ciency may be due to the calming and non-pressured
nature of mindfulness practices. Thus, the delivery of MBIs might be optimised by emphasising toparticipants the importance of focusing on the process instead of the outcome in goal-attainment
endeavours. Construed clinically, such messages might particularly bene ﬁt those with anxiety and
related disorders who usually self-reported struggles with racing and perseverative thoughts that
compromised EF and associated capacities (Spinhoven et al., 2022 ; Zainal & Newman, 2022 ).
Non-signi ﬁcant e ﬀects: episodic memory, verbal ﬂuency, & cognitive error
Also, there was no evidence of MBI (vs. control) e ﬀects on episodic memory, verbal ﬂuency, and cog-
nitive error. Such results support hypotheses of null relations between trait mindfulness and declara-tive/episodic memory vs. emotionally-charged or personally-salient autobiographical memories
(Levi & Rosenstreich, 2019 ; Whit ﬁeld et al., 2022 ). The ﬁndings also support hypotheses that MBIs
likely do not assist with the storage and recall phases of verbal learning (Lueke & Lueke, 2019 ;
Whitﬁeld et al., 2022 ). Conversely, the outcomes di ﬀered from a recent qualitative review that indi-
cated a bene ﬁcial eﬀ ect of MBIs on verbal ﬂuency (Hazlett-Stevens et al., 2019 ); however, that review
focused on older adults and assessed verbal ﬂuency solely with the controlled oral word association
test. More importantly, the limitations of MBIs (i.e., what our research has shown it may not impact)
should be explicitly communicated when delivering these interventions to improve cognitive func-tioning. Our nonsigni ﬁcant results might also mean that the cognitive functioning measures ofHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 15
episodic memory, verbal ﬂuency, and cognitive error must be sensitive to changes in RCTs. Such sen-
sitive assessments are necessary to accurately detect changes over time and assess the e ﬃcacy of
MBIs targeting cognitive improvement (Shields et al., 2023 ).
Moderators to examine heterogeneity of treatment e ﬀects
Number of sessions and treatment duration
There was no evidence that number of sessions and treatment duration were treatment moderators,
contradicting the dose –response treatment eﬀ ects hypothesis (Chiesa et al., 2011 ) and replicating
recent quantitative reviews (Im et al., 2021 ; Verhaeghen, 2021 ). These nonsigni ﬁcantﬁndings are
encouraging since brief MBIs might alleviate distress and enhance cognitive functioning (Schumeret al., 2018 ), which could have major clinical implications concerning scalability and dissemination.
Practitioners delivering MBIs and seeking to shrink the implementation gap should thus accentuatethe pragmatic cognitive bene ﬁts of brief mindfulness exercises daily, regardless of a busy schedule.
On this note, low adherence has been touted as one of the reasons why the potential of MBIs on
various health-related outcomes has been underrealized (Baydoun et al., 2021 ). Brief MBIs that are
more actionable and easier to integrate into one ’s lifestyle than lengthier ones thus bode well in
eﬀorts to improve speciﬁ c cognitive functioning domains (Zainal & Newman, 2023 ).
Study quality
There was no evidence that study quality moderated the e ﬀect of MBIs (vs. active controls) on global
cognition, inhibition latency, sustained attention accuracy, and subjective cognitive functioning.
Future RCTs should continue to exemplify high standards.
Socio-demographics
We found no evidence that age moderated the e ﬀects of MBIs (vs. active controls) on global cogni-
tion, WM latency, inhibition accuracy and latency, processing speed, cognitive error, sustained atten-
tion accuracy, and subjective cognitive functioning. Findings align with theories that argue MBIs can
beneﬁt cognitive functioning equally for adults at various developmental stages (e.g., Berk et al.,
2017 ). Further, no evidence that gender moderated the impact of MBIs (vs. active controls) on
global cognition, inhibition latency, sustained attention accuracy, and subjective cognitive function-ing emerged, supporting the idea that MBIs likely positively in ﬂuence males and females equally
(Katz & Toner, 2013 ). MBI instructors should spotlight these ﬁndings to foster diversity, equity,
and inclusion when attempting to improve cognitive functioning via MBIs in various sociodemo-graphic groups.
Clinical status
MBIs (vs. active controls) had stronger eﬀ ects on global cognition and sustained attention accuracy
for those with elevated psychiatric symptoms and healthy controls than those with heightenedmedical symptoms. However, the impact of MBIs on subjective cognitive functioning was more pro-nounced for persons with heightened medical symptoms, followed by healthy controls and then
those with elevated psychiatric symptoms. The reasons for these contradictory results remain
unclear. Perhaps the stronger correlation between negative aﬀ ective symptoms and the mindfulness
describing skills in medical samples (Carpenter et al., 2019 ), coupled with higher distress levels and
the motivating eﬀ ect of physical illness stressors on mindfulness practices and related healthy beha-
viours, might explain these ﬁndings. Such factors could promote subjective cognitive functioning
(Hodges et al., 2005 ; Sala et al., 2020 ). Future research is necessary to understand these results
better. Overall, clinical implications from our ﬁndings include the possible therapeutic roles of
MBIs in cognitive rehabilitation for cognitive impairments (e.g., ADHD, schizophrenia; Shen et al.,2023 ) and adjunctive bene ﬁts when oﬀ ered in conjunction with other mental health treatments16 N. H. ZAINAL AND M. G. NEWMAN
(Bursky et al., 2022 ). Other practical implications include the potential of MBIs in prevention and early
intervention for non-clinical, albeit high-risk, subpopulations (Ma et al., 2019 ).
Treatment delivery
Face-to-face MBIs (vs. active controls) compared to app –or Internet-delivered self-guided MBIs
showed more potent eﬀ ects on global cognition, sustained attention accuracy, and subjective cog-
nitive functioning, but not inhibition latency. This pattern may be attributed to greater accountabil-
ity and motivation with therapeutic support of face-to-face MBIs, concordant with literature on MBIstargeting depression, anxiety, and related mental health symptoms (French et al., 2017 ; Spijkerman
et al., 2016 ), as proposed by the supportive accountability theory (Mohr et al., 2011 ) and eﬃ ciency
model of support (Schueller et al., 2017 ). Future work should examine how the added bene ﬁts of
an instructor-led format outweigh the gains of fully self-guided MBIs, such as scalability and
reduced costs. If replicated, an essential policy implication is that self-guided MBIs should only be
oﬀered to subgroups that would bene ﬁt most from them (Benjet et al., 2023 ).
Type of MBI
Non-standard MBIs (vs. standard MBSR or MBCT) showed stronger e ﬀects on global cognition, sus-
tained attention accuracy, and subjective cognitive functioning. Studies comparing non-standard
MBIs to active controls tended to incorporate tailored treatments for speci ﬁc populations (e.g., mili-
tary cohorts; Jha et al., 2019 ). Adapting protocols to meet the needs of the target population might
yield enhanced treatment eﬀ ects compared to standard MBIs, a vital policy implication when devel-
oping and disseminating MBIs to speciﬁ c subgroups. Achieving optimal eﬃ cacy in adapting MBIs
necessitates thoughtful responses to unique cultural, organisational, or socio-political considerations
(Oman, 2023 ). It is advisable to apply a meticulous ‘cost-bene ﬁt’analysis to discern which elements
of MBIs necessitate adaptation, thereby ensuring the utmost suitability and e ﬀectiveness in optimis-
ing cognitive functioning.
Study limitations and strengths
Study limitations should be considered. First, variations in the delivery of MBI protocols could not be
fully accounted for (Cuijpers et al., 2008 ). Signi ﬁcant heterogeneity was observed for four domains
(global cognition, inhibition latency, sustained attention accuracy, and subjective cognitive function-
ing) compared to active controls, indicating large irregularities in treatment structure and content
(Van Dam et al., 2018 ; Whit ﬁeld et al., 2022 ). Future MBI RCTs should focus on standardising MBI
treatment protocol implementation to strengthen internal validity, construct validity, and replicabil-
ity (Crane & Hecht, 2018b ; Moncher & Prinz, 1991 ). Eﬀorts should also address missing outcome data
bias by employing the gold standard ITT analysis since complete-case analyses likely in ﬂate eﬀ ect
sizes (McCoy, 2017 ). Additionally, the current meta-analysis cannot disambiguate the e ﬀects of
speciﬁ c MBIs techniques due to limited dismantling studies on cognitive outcomes (Britton et al.,
2018 ).
Future eﬀ orts should isolate speciﬁ c MBI components within RCTs via dismantling studies (Stein &
Witkiewitz, 2020 ) and network meta-analyses (Furukawa et al., 2021 ) to better understand how MBIs
enhance cognitive functions. Since stand-alone MBI techniques could yield comparable bene ﬁts to
manualized MBI packages on psychological symptoms (Blanck et al., 2018 ), future studies could
examine if this pattern extends to cognitive functioning. Moreover, testing the diﬀ erential eﬀ ects
ofunique mindfulness techniques, such as FA vs. OM, on separate cognitive function subdomains
(e.g., Britton et al., 2018 ) would advance the ﬁeld.
Sample characteristics pose other shortcomings. Age range restrictions were observed in studies
examining MBIs on orienting (ages 8– 50), warranting investigations into treatment e ﬀects across
older age groups. Ethnicity breakdown was not reported in 63% of studies, and virtually nostudies reported the sexual orientation/gender identity of participants, highlighting severeHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 17
shortcomings in the literature (Heck et al., 2017 ). Recruiting middle-class, White females with tertiary
education and above was common (Mars & Abbey, 2010 ). It is essential to test MBIs’ impact on
diverse populations, as outcomes may vary, such as weaker e ﬀects in older adults (Goldberg
et al., 2021 ), children (Dunning et al., 2019 ), persons of colour, and those with low income (Sun
et al., 2022 ). Future studies should strive to include such information to reduce health disparities con-
cerning the positive eﬀ ects of MBIs on cognitive functioning.
Limitations notwithstanding, our meta-analysis has several strengths. We included unpublished
theses and grey literature to address publication bias, including preprints (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ).
Our dataset allowed us to test if age, gender, study quality, treatment duration, retention percen-
tage, analysis approach, MBI type, delivery mode, clinical status, and ﬁdelity checks moderated treat-
ment eﬀ ects. Further, this meta-analysis can catalyse future work on individual di ﬀerences and
treatment adaptations by synthesising e ﬀect sizes to determine the impact of MBIs on various cog-
nitive subdomains.
Conclusions
In summary, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 111 MBI RCTs suggested that MBIs bene ﬁtted global
cognition and six cognitive subdomains (regardless of the control group and after adjusting for pres-ence of ﬁdelity checks). Speci ﬁcally, MBIs showed positive eﬀ ects on executive attention, inhibition
accuracy, WM accuracy, shifting accuracy, sustained attention accuracy, intra-individual coe ﬃcient of
variation, and subjective cognitive functioning. However, MBIs did not signi ﬁcantly positively a ﬀect
orienting, WM latency, inhibition latency, shifting latency, processing speed, verbal ﬂuency, episodic
memory, and cognitive error. Overall, MBIs improved EF and sustained attention accuracy-based
rather than latency-based outcomes, likely because mindfulness practices promote present-
moment awareness and eﬀ ective goal attainment over eﬃ ciency (Hoge et al., 2021 ). These improve-
ments in EF and sustained attention accuracy indices might contribute to why MBIs improve mood
regulation (Gu et al., 2015 ) and physical immunity (Dunn & Dimolareva, 2022 ). Additionally, the
enhancement of subjective cognitive functioning by MBIs might be one mechanism underlyingimproved ﬂexible thinking and perspective-taking (Mediavilla et al., 2021 ).
Our extensive meta-analysis determined the e ﬀect of various moderators of MBIs on global cog-
nition and 15 cognitive subdomains. Few signi ﬁcant moderator results emerged. Psychiatric and
medical samples vs. healthy controls generally bene ﬁtted more from MBIs to target global cognition,
some accuracy-based indices (inhibition, WM, sustained attention), and subjective cognitive func-
tioning. Also, the absence of dose –response eﬀ ects bodes well for the prospect of brief and scalable
MBIs (e.g., Zainal & Newman, 2023 ) to enhance global cognition and the abovementioned six cog-
nitive domains. Simultaneously, compared to self-guided MBIs, instructor-led face-to-face MBIsyielded more considerable impact on global cognition, sustained attention accuracy, and subjective
cognitive functioning, highlighting the value of delivery by a quali ﬁed practitioner. Non-standard
MBIs that tended to be highly tailored to speciﬁ c target populations were better than standard
MBIs in improving sustained attention accuracy and subjective cognitive functioning.
To conclude, our meta-analysis on the eﬀ ect of MBIs on cognitive functioning adds to the exten-
sive discourse that explored the potential advantages of mindfulness in clinical, education, work-
place settings, and leadership roles, with a growing body of research actively examining these
aspects (London et al., 2023 ). Our ﬁndings contribute to emerging narratives of policy implications
of MBIs by augmenting a body of research showing that skills nurtured through MBIs encompassing
compassion, mindfulness, and self-regulation (Bristow, 2019 ) could extend to speciﬁ c cognitive func-
tioning domains. Speci ﬁcally, our ﬁndings suggest that MBIs can enhance cognitive functioning
through the augmentation of executive attention, heightened WM, inhibition, set-shifting accuracy,sustained attention, and elevated subjective cognitive functioning. Hence, the integration of mind-
fulness in eﬀ orts to enhance speciﬁ c cognitive functioning domains has the potential to play a criti-
cal role in shaping its future discourse and impact in the realms of research, policy, and practice.18 N. H. ZAINAL AND M. G. NEWMAN
