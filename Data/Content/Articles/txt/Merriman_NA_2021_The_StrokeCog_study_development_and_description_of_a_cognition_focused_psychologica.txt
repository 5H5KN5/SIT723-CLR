ABSTRACT
Objective: To describe the process of developing a cognitive
rehabilitation intervention for patients with post-stroke cognitiveimpairment (PSCI) and to describe the intervention prior to evalu-
ation in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Method: The
Medical Research Council framework, ‘Developing and evaluating
complex interventions ’, was used to develop the cognitive
rehabilitation intervention. We conducted a combined analysis ofthe existing evidence base for PSCI rehabilitation alongside quali-
tative exploration of the perspectives of stroke survivors, their
families, and healthcare professionals providing stroke care, on
the necessary components for a cognitive rehabilitation interven-
tion for PSCI. The Template for Intervention Description andReplication checklist was used as a structural framework for the
description of the intervention. Results: The intervention com-
prises a five-week intervention integrating group-based activities,
supported by a clinical neuropsychologist, with home-based activ-
ities to encourage self-efficacy through the practice of adjustmentand compensatory strategies learned in the group format to
achieve the patients ’identified goals in managing their PSCI.
Conclusion: A cognitive rehabilitation intervention for patients
with PSCI has been developed and described. We are in the pro-
cess of developing a structured intervention manual to standard-
ise the content and delivery of the intervention for further testing
in a pilot RCT.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide (Feigin et al.,
2017 ). Cognitive impairment has been reported to have a prevalence of over 50% in
patients six months post-stroke (Mellon et al., 2015 ), with 38% of stroke survivors pre-
senting with a level of cognitive impairment one year after stroke that does not meetthe criteria for dementia (Sexton et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, the risk of dementia sub-
stantially increases following stroke, with an incidence rate of 34% one year after a
severe stroke (Pendlebury & Rothwell, 2009 ). While the rehabilitation of the physical
consequences of stroke has received much research focus (Horgan et al., 2008 ; Saka
et al., 2009 ), less attention has been given to the cognitive and psychological sequelae
of stroke and their subsequent impact on stroke survivors ’adjustment to their physical
and social environments (Hall et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, the efficacy of cognitive
rehabilitation of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) has yet to be established in
the literature, particularly when each affected cognitive domain (i.e., attention, execu-tive function, memory, spatial neglect) is targeted in isolation (Bowen et al., 2013 ;
Chung et al., 2013 ; das Nair et al., 2016 ; Loetscher & Lincoln, 2013 ; Loetscher
et al., 2019 ).
Recognition of the effect of the consequences of diseases on patients ’outcomes
has informed the development of the biopsychosocial model of illness (Engel, 1977 ;
Wade, 2015 ; Wade & Halligan, 2017 ), on which the International Classification of
Functioning, Disability, and Health (WHO ICF) is based (WHO, 2001 ). The WHO ICF
focuses not only on body functions and impairment, but also on the impact of illness
on an individual ’s activities and participation. These factors are viewed relative to the
health condition as well as the individual ’s personal, social, and environmen-
tal contexts.
The StrokeCog study was established to model and modify the consequences of
stroke-related cognitive impairment through intervention (Merriman et al., 2017 ). The
overarching aims of the project are to profile cognitive function in stroke patients inboth the short- and long-term, to develop and then assess the effectiveness of a cog-nitive intervention to address PSCI, and to examine the cost-effectiveness of deliveringthe intervention in a healthcare setting. The rehabilitation of cognitive and psycho-logical consequences of stroke is considered a complex intervention, which encom-
passes multiple interacting components (Craig et al., 2008 ). For example, patient
characteristics such as heterogeneous levels of fatigue, adjustment post-stroke (i.e.,emotional well-being, stress, etc.), impairment awareness, and functioning are likely tointeract with each other and impact upon the intervention design. Due to the com-plex nature of cognitive rehabilitation, both in terms of the intervention componentsand patient and system characteristics, it is essential that the development and designof such interventions are described transparently to enable replication and help with
facilitating evidence-based care (Hoffmann & Walker, 2015 ). The Template for
Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist is a useful tool in this regardto ensure detailed description of the particular intervention components (Hoffmannet al., 2014 ; Schmidt et al., 2018 ). The TIDieR checklist was developed through a pro-
cess of literature review, a Delphi survey of international experts and stakeholders,PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 793
and a face-to-face panel meeting and is an extension of the Consolidated Standards
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement (Schulz et al., 2010 ).
We systematically developed the StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation intervention for
management of the impact of PSCI on activities and participation, based on the WHOICF (WHO, 2001 ), and using the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for devel-
oping and evaluating complex interventions (Craig et al., 2008 ). We aim to describe
the process of developing the intervention for patients with PSCI and supply adetailed description of the intervention prior to evaluation in a pilot randomised con-trolled trial (RCT).
Methods and results
Medical research council framework –phase 1: Intervention development
The StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation intervention was developed systematically,
using the MRC framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions (Craiget al., 2008 ). The development stage (Phase 1) of the MRC framework comprises three
steps: (i) establishing the existing evidence base, (ii) identifying relevant theory, and(iii) modelling process and outcomes, respectively. Relevant stakeholders comprising
stroke survivors, their family members, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) providing
stroke care were involved in informing the development and design of the cognitiveintervention (Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ), particularly where there were gaps in
the literature.
Establishing the evidence base
Five previous Cochrane reviews have been conducted on the topic of post-stroke cog-nitive rehabilitation. These reviews have focused on occupational therapy for cognitiveimpairment (Hoffmann et al., 2010 ) and cognitive rehabilitation targeting executive
dysfunction (Chung et al., 2013 ), attention deficits (Loetscher & Lincoln, 2013 ;
Loetscher et al., 2019 ), memory deficits (das Nair et al., 2016 ), and spatial neglect
(Bowen et al., 2013 ) resulting from stroke. The conclusion of each review has been
that the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation aimed at each of these domains sep-arately has yet to be established. However, the pattern of PSCI suggests that deficitsare rarely limited to one cognitive domain in isolation and may be manifested acrossall cognitive domains (Sachdev et al., 2004 ; Vasquez & Zakzanis, 2015 ), with the sever-
ity of the cognitive impairment across different domains after stroke predicted by thelesion location (Barker-Collo et al., 2012 ; Nys et al., 2005 ). A further systematic review
of 22 trials (nine of which focused on non-core domains such as perception and lan-guage) found a small overall effect of cognitive rehabilitation for general cognitiveimpairment post-stroke at the impairment level of functioning (Rogers et al., 2018 ).
Similarly, our research team ’s systematic review of non-RCTs of psychological interven-
tions for PSCI found a small overall effect on global cognition at the impairment level(Merriman, Sexton, et al., 2019 ), although these studies exhibited a high risk of bias
and were of low quality. To address global cognitive dysfunction, cognitive interven-tions need to address a broad range of cognitive processes, while also having thescope to be tailored to the specific needs of individual patients, including design794 N. A. MERRIMAN ET AL.
features relating to intervention target, mode, intensity, duration, and frequency
(Hoffmann et al., 2014 ).
As these important intervention design features (i.e., intensity, duration, frequency,
etc.) of cognitive rehabilitation interventions post-stroke have yet to be established in
the literature (McDonald et al., 2019 ), we conducted qualitative interviews with stroke
survivors, their family members, and HCPs who provide stroke care to gain their per-spectives on what particular intervention components should be included in thedesign of a cognitive rehabilitation intervention (Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ).
Identifying relevant theory
The overall goal of the StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation intervention is to enable
stroke survivors to enhance their self-efficacy and confidence in their ability to managetheir cognitive impairments and is based on the theoretical foundation of the biopsy-chosocial model (Engel, 1977 ). The WHO ICF (WHO, 2001 ) applies the biopsychosocial
model of illness by focusing on the main components of disability, namely impair-ment, activities, and participation viewed in the personal, physical, and social contexts
of the individual (Wade, 2005 ). This framework highlights the importance of conduct-
ing a thorough clinical and cognitive assessment in terms of the stroke survivor ’s cur-
rent level of functioning and how that relates to the person ’s premorbid function and
context, while also determining what is important to them in order to optimise cogni-tive rehabilitation by making it relevant and meaningful to the person ’s goals and
cognitive profile (Mateer, 2005 ).
Self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1991 ), which proposes that successful performance of
a target behaviour is predicted by the patient ’s confidence in achieving that behav-
iour, further lends itself to optimising the impact of cognitive rehabilitation. Previousresearch has shown that the development of self-efficacy in managing cognitiveimpairment following stroke may be facilitated by experiences of achievement i) intasks that are tailored to the individual ’s goals and cognitive capabilities; ii) through
comparisons with other stroke survivors via peer support activities; and iii) throughverbal encouragement (Horne et al., 2014 ; Woodman et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, the
ability of stroke survivors to regain confidence in their own capacity was a prevalent
theme in our qualitative analysis (Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ). Systematic review evi-
dence has demonstrated that self-efficacy is associated with better quality of life andadjustment post-stroke (Jones & Riazi, 2011 ). Goal setting and action planning are
means through which patients can actively engage with their rehabilitation and man-age their cognitive impairment (Hevey et al., 2020 ; Parsons et al., 2018 ). Both the biop-
sychosocial model and self-efficacy theory emphasise the importance of learning andpracticing new skills during one ’s everyday life in one ’s own environment. In this way,
stroke survivors can achieve their rehabilitation goals with home activities, through
practicing and applying cognitive strategies learned in the rehabilitation group to real-
life situations. Practicing new skills in the context of their own environment will fur-ther serve to empower individual stroke survivors to problem-solve and manage theircognitive impairment (Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ).PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 795
Modelling outcomes and processes
Intervention outcomes and processes were modelled as recommended (Buhse &
M€uhlhauser, 2015 ; Sermeus, 2015 ), based on the synthesis of the scientific literature
and qualitative work with stakeholders to inform the choice and role of interventioncomponents, and the most relevant outcome measures to evaluate the effect of the
cognitive rehabilitation intervention. The chosen outcome measures comprise compos-
ite outcomes of cognitive function as measured by the National Institute ofNeurological Disorders and Stroke battery of cognitive assessment (Hachinski et al.,2006 ) (to be conducted approximately six weeks post-stroke), patient relevant out-
comes, such as activities of daily living and stroke severity, and patient-reported out-comes such as self-efficacy and confidence (Buhse & M €uhlhauser, 2015 ; Horne
et al., 2017 ).
The modelling of processes, also based on combining systematic review evidence
with qualitative findings and clinical expertise, resulted in 36 clinical activities beinggrouped into eight key intervention components (see Table 1 ). These key components
were incorporated across sessions within the cognitive rehabilitation intervention.Figure 1 outlines the process map of the StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation interven-
tion, with a brief description of each stage of the intervention.
Intervention description and rationale
The TIDieR checklist (Hoffmann et al., 2014 ) was used to structure and describe the
cognitive rehabilitation intervention.
TIDieR item 1: Brief name
The StrokeCog study: a group-based cognitive rehabilitation intervention, coupledwith individualised home-based activities for patients with PSCI.
TIDieR item 2: Why: describe rationale, theory, or goal of the elements essential
to the intervention
This intervention contains eight essential elements, comprising 36 clinical activities,
which were derived from existing cognitive rehabilitation and self-management mate-rials, drawing from the traumatic brain injury evidence-base (Cicerone et al., 2005 ,
2011 ; Headway, 2018 ; Lorig et al., 2012 ; Powell, 2013 ; Velikonja et al., 2014 ) as well as
expertise from clinicians trained in secondary stroke prevention and neuropsychology,
respectively.
Clinical assessment of cognitive functioning is an essential facet of cognitive
rehabilitation to ensure the intervention is tailored to the cognitive profile of thestroke survivor and to ensure the activities are aimed at goals that are meaningful tothe individual (Mateer, 2005 ).
Psychoeducation , including information concerning knowledge and consequences
of stroke and stroke secondary prevention (Parappilly et al., 2020 ) was identified by
stakeholders as being a crucial component of cognitive rehabilitation (Merriman,Bruen, et al., 2019 ).796 N. A. MERRIMAN ET AL.
Goal setting and action planning are key elements of stroke rehabilitation. Goals
that are relevant to the everyday life of the stroke survivor and are decided upon col-
laboratively with HCPs can lead to better outcomes, performance and goal achieve-ment, and engagement with the intervention (Sugavanam et al., 2013 ).
Supports , such as information available from charitable organisations such as
Headway Ireland and the Irish Heart Foundation are important to sign post as poten-tial avenues of ongoing support for both the stroke survivor and family member once
the intervention has finished. The support and involvement of family members may
also encourage engagement with the cognitive rehabilitation intervention and aid theTable 1. The eight key components and the 36 clinical activities.

practicing of cognitive strategies in the home environment. Weekly phone support
from the facilitator may assist with problem solving in achieving rehabilitation goalsand serve as a prompt to continue practicing cognitive strategies in everyday activities(Behn et al., 2019 ).
Emotional well-being/adjustment can be affected post-stroke, with anxiety affect-
ing 20% to 25% of stroke survivors (Knapp et al., 2020 ). Cognitive rehabilitation can
incorporate interventions such as mindfulness and relaxation to help manage thestroke survivor ’s emotional distress, which may also impact cognitive dysfunction
(Cicerone et al., 2000 ). Including a brief mindfulness and relaxation segment as an
addition to cognitive rehabilitation, rather than the focus, may offer a beneficial cop-
ing strategy to stroke survivors (Jani et al., 2018 ).
Managing cognitive impairment is the crux of cognitive rehabilitation. The
StrokeCog cognitive intervention includes various approaches based on the traumaticbrain injury literature, including: a) restoration of previously learned behaviours orskills and cognitive function through repetition and reinforcement; b) the use of
internal compensatory cognitive strategies to compensate for neuropsychological defi-
cits; (c) the use of external cognitive strategies such as diary use, mobile phonereminders, or environmental structuring and support to compensate for neuropsycho-logical deficits; and (d) enabling stroke survivors to manage their cognitive impairmentin order to improve their overall level of functioning and quality of life (Ciceroneet al., 2000 ).
Peer support and learning is facilitated through a group-based intervention,
which creates opportunities for social interaction and facilitation of sharing

experiences of the impact of stroke and coping strategies, while also helping to nor-
malise experiences following a stroke (Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ). Group-based ses-
sions also allow for the consolidation of learning through repetition and rehearsal ofcognitive strategies.
Individualised exercises based on the stroke survivor ’s identified goals and tail-
ored to their cognitive profile allow for the individual to practice cognitive skills andstrategies outside of the rehabilitation group in their own home environment(Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ).
TIDieR item 3: What (materials)
The intervention facilities include a tutorial room with laptop and projecting equip-
ment on which the interactive learning and discussion material is presented by twofacilitators.
A standardised booklet summarising the main points of each session is provided.Materials such as hand-outs and worksheets to facilitate action planning for achiev-
able goals that are relevant to the individual needs of the stroke survivor and their
cognitive profile, based on managing PSCI, are provided. These materials include help-ful tools and tips for implementing compensatory strategies across the different cogni-tive deficits covered during group sessions.
Brief questionnaires regarding the stroke survivor ’s strengths and weaknesses with
attention, executive function, and memory are provided to group members each weekin preparation for the respective session covering these cognitive domains.
Stroke survivors are provided with a link to a website with exercises for mindfulness
and relaxation ( http://www.beaumont.ie/marc ) and other self-help materials (Headway)
(http://headway.ie/about-brain-injury/info-resources/ ).
Stroke survivors provide a telephone number to receive a phone call mid-week
from the intervention facilitator.
TIDieR item 4: What (procedures)
Due to the limited information identified through examining the evidence-base inPhase 1 of the MRC framework (McDonald et al., 2019 ), decisions relating to interven-
tion content, format, duration, dose, and delivery were informed by qualitative workwith stroke HCPs, stroke survivors, and their family members/carers, .
In terms of intervention content, the qualitative findings recommended the inclu-
sion of psychoeducation regarding the consequences of and adjustment to stroke.Several stroke survivors and family members highlighted a lack of clear communica-tion regarding the impact of stroke on their return to pre-stroke lives and that cogni-tive rehabilitation should address this from the outset (Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ).
Interviewees indicated that cognitive rehabilitation content should be meaningful forthe stroke survivor and relevant to what s/he wants to achieve (focusing on activity
and participation levels of functioning, taking into account the individual ’s goals and
context) and be cognisant of the moderating effect of a stroke survivor ’s capacity to
engage with the intervention, considering potential fluctuating levels of fatigue,mood, and functioning. The focus on assisting the stroke survivor in making changesPSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 799
that improve their function in areas that are relevant to their everyday lives is the
cornerstone of cognitive rehabilitation (Cicerone et al., 2000 ).
The resulting cognitive rehabilitation intervention is a five-week group-based
(N¼4) and largely interactive format, with short presentations relating to psychoedu-
cation and adjustment to stroke-related deficits in the core cognitive domains of
executive function, attention, and memory, respectively, and strategies addressing the
activities and participation levels of functioning from the WHO ICF framework (WHO,2001 ). Each session lasts approximately 2.5 h, with a break and refreshments in the
middle. Based on the identification of relevant theory in the development of this com-
plex intervention, home activities are included to encourage self-efficacy (Bandura,
1991 ) in tasks that are tailored to the individual ’s goals and cognitive capabilities, and
the generalisation of skills and strategies learned, through the practice of skills learned
in the group format to achieve these goals (Horne et al., 2014 ; Woodman et al., 2014 ).
Session 1 –Introduction and psychoeducation: The first session begins with wel-
coming the stroke survivors and outlining the content and process of the StrokeCog
cognitive rehabilitation intervention. Topics include: discussion about causes and
impact of different stroke types; secondary prevention and lifestyle; adjustment post-stroke; common mood and behavioural consequences of stroke; information about
available supports; information for family members; introduction to action planning;
introduction to emotional well-being/adjustment and mindfulness; and a self-reportquestionnaire on executive functioning for the following week ’s topic.
Session 2 –Executive Function: Topics include: discussion of the previous session
and practice of home-based activities; introduction to processes and brain areasinvolved in executive function; common difficulties in planning and organising follow-
ing stroke; different types of useful strategies (environment restructuring, internal and
external compensatory aids); real-life experiences and problem solving; identificationof three strategies to practice in the home setting; action planning; and a self-report
questionnaire on memory for the following week ’s topic.
Session 3 –Memory: Topics include: discussion of the previous session and home-
based activities; introduction to processes and brain areas involved in different typesof memory; common difficulties in encoding, storing, and recalling information follow-
ing stroke; different types of useful strategies (environmental restructuring, internal
and external compensatory aids); real-life experiences and problem solving; identifica-tion of three strategies to practice in the home setting; action planning; and a self-
report questionnaire on attention for the following week ’s topic.
Session 4 –Attention: Topics include: discussion of the previous session; introduc-
tion to processes and brain areas involved in different types of attention; common dif-
ficulties in attention and concentration following stroke; different types of useful
strategies (environment restructuring, internal and external compensatory aids); collab-oratively working through real-life experiences and problem solving difficulties; identi-
fication of three strategies to practice in the home setting; and action planning.
Session 5: Topics include: recap on stroke psychoeducation covered in Session 1; dis-
cussion about experience using the different types of strategies; making a plan to continue
to employ the strategies learned and practiced during the rehabilitation intervention; and
discussion of how to deal with future stroke-related challenges (see Figure 1 ).800 N. A. MERRIMAN ET AL.
TIDieR item 5: Who provided
In examining the evidence base, a range of different therapists were involved in deliv-
ering cognitive rehabilitation across previous studies (Merriman, Sexton, et al., 2019 ;
Rogers et al., 2018 ). Our qualitative findings recommended that the cognitive rehabili-
tation intervention be delivered by a HCP trained in adjustment post-stroke. As the
WHO ICF recommends a full clinical and cognitive assessment prior to cognitive
rehabilitation to tailor the content to individual nuanced cognitive impairment(Mateer, 2005 ), the cognitive rehabilitation intervention groups are facilitated by a clin-
ical neuropsychologist, supported by a stroke researcher and an assistant psychologist.The stroke researcher is involved in all aspects of assessment but not in interventiondelivery; the assistant psychologist provides hands-on support in the setting up of
group sessions, meeting and greeting patients (and family members, where relevant)
and assisting the clinical neuropsychologist in running the sessions, as well as com-pleting phone calls to participants to encourage self-efficacy, facilitate generalisationof skills, and trouble-shoot any difficulties encountered with home-based activities.
TIDieR item 6: How - modes of delivery
There was much heterogeneity in the literature regarding cognitive intervention deliv-ery, with modes ranging from individualised computer-based sessions and pen-and-paper exercises to group-based interventions (Merriman, Sexton, et al., 2019 ; Rogers
et al., 2018 ). Drawing on our qualitative findings, interviewees recommended the
inclusion of both group-based and individualised components to incorporate peersupport and tailored activities. This combination of delivery modes allows the strokesurvivor to compare their achievements in completing their individualised activitiesand group-based activities with that of similarly affected group members, and to learnfrom their peers ’own strategies in managing cognitive impairment (Horne et al., 2014 ;
Woodman et al., 2014 ).
As the optimum timing of cognitive rehabilitation post-stroke is still unclear, recruit-
ment of stroke survivors is from inpatient acute and rehabilitation settings. The cogni-
tive rehabilitation intervention is delivered face-to-face in a group setting. To support
stroke survivors between sessions in achieving their chosen action plans, a bookletsummarising the main points of each session (see Item 3) and telephone calls aremade weekly to participants by the assistant psychologist.
TIDieR item 7: Where - type of location
The group can be run in a tutorial room in a large tertiary referral hospital, or localhospital, or in community venues that are as convenient as possible for eachgroup member.
TIDieR item 8: When and how much
The group sessions last approximately 2.5 h and run for five consecutive weeks, to
facilitate participants in the implementation and practice of strategies learned in
between sessions (see Figure 1 ). The dose and duration of sessions is informed by the
qualitative findings and based on the organisational context (i.e., health system resour-ces) in which the StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation intervention takes place. ThePSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 801
intervention duration also takes into account challenges noted by family members
and stroke survivors of continued engagement over a longer period of time, givenother commitments (Merriman, Bruen, et al., 2019 ). Two hour group sessions are toler-
ated well by similar acquired brain injury populations (Behn et al., 2019 ).
TIDieR item 9: Tailoring
The cognitive rehabilitation intervention is partly standardised and partly patient-cen-
tred. Tailoring occurs through individual goal setting and through discussion topicswithin the group context.
Previous research has recommended that cognitive rehabilitation for stroke survi-
vors be tailored to the individual ’s level of cognitive impairment (Cicerone et al.,
2005 ), as some types of cognitive rehabilitation (e.g., internal compensatory strategies
and metacognitive instruction strategies) are more effective for those with mild cogni-tive impairment compared to those with severe cognitive impairment. For this reason,intervention groups need to be stratified by level of cognitive impairment, as thosewith mild cognitive impairment will have different needs to those with moderate cog-nitive impairment (Mateer, 2005 ).
TIDieR item 10: Modifications during the course of the study
Modifications during the pilot RCT will be recorded through constant process evalu-
ation and will be reported in the evaluation study.
TIDieR item 11: How well (planned)
Fidelity to the intervention protocol will be assessed in the pilot RCT. Attendance,attrition, and engagement (through attempting to achieve self-set goals throughaction planning) with the cognitive rehabilitation intervention will be recorded by thefacilitators.
TIDieR item 12: How well (actual)
Attendance and intervention acceptability will be reported in the evaluation study.
Finalising the intervention
The resulting StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation intervention consists of a five-weekgroup-based cognitive intervention comprising psychoeducation, cognitive strategytraining across cognitive domains consisting of executive function, memory, and atten-tion, coupled with home-based exercises tailored to the patient ’s individual functional
goals and cognitive profile.
To summarise the design and development stage of the intervention, the system-
atic review evidence thus far suggests a small effect of cognitive rehabilitation on glo-bal cognition, although the optimal timing, dose, frequency, and duration has yet tobe established (Merriman, Sexton, et al., 2019 ). Based on the combined analysis of sys-
tematic review evidence and qualitative interviews with stroke survivors, their familymembers, and HCPs who provide stroke care, and the identification of the relevanttheory underpinning the intervention design, we hypothesise that a group-based802 N. A. MERRIMAN ET AL.
cognitive intervention comprising psychoeducation regarding the consequences of
stroke and adjustment, cognitive strategy training across cognitive domains, as
described, coupled with home exercises tailored to the patient ’s individual goals and
cognitive profile, will have an effect on stroke survivors ’self-efficacy in managing their
cognitive impairment.
We conducted initial feasibility and acceptability testing with two groups of stroke
survivors: (1) a mild/moderate PSCI group with two participants (1 male, 1 female;aged 63 and 44, respectively; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 25 and
20, respectively); and (2) a severe PSCI group with two patients (2 males, aged 77 and
79 respectively, both with a MoCA score of 15), and two family members (one family
member of each patient). The mild/moderate PSCI group found the intervention con-
tent, duration, and dose to be acceptable. However, while the family carers of the
severely cognitively impaired stroke survivors reported finding the intervention con-
tent informative, the stroke survivors themselves reported being unable to engage
with the intervention, even at a reduced session length of an hour with refreshment
breaks. A pilot RCT will aim to compare the StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation inter-vention to usual care for stroke survivors with mild to moderate PSCI. The primary
focus of the pilot RCT is on recruitment and retention of patients in the intervention,
and follow-up assessments. We will also investigate outcomes associated with the
intervention and the anticipated effect size for powering a larger trial, with a focus on
the feasibility of implementing the intervention in a future definitive RCT.
Discussion
A cognitive rehabilitation intervention for PSCI has been systematically developedbased on the MRC guidelines for development and evaluation of complex interven-
tions (Craig et al., 2008). In order to structure and manualise the intervention, the
intervention was fully described using the TIDieR checklist (Hoffmann et al., 2014 ). The
StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation intervention is designed to incorporate both a
group-based format, allowing for peer learning and support, with individual home
exercises tailored to the goals and cognitive profile of each participant. Ascertaining
the cognitive profile of stroke survivors to establish their cognitive strengths andweaknesses prior to implementing cognitive rehabilitation is critical to optimising cog-
nitive rehabilitation (Mateer, 2005 ). The overall goal of the intervention is to enable
stroke survivors to enhance their self-efficacy and confidence in their ability to manage
the impact of their particular cognitive impairments on their everyday lives, and to
achieve meaningful, functional goals.
There are a number of strengths associated with the design of this cognitive
rehabilitation intervention. Firstly, the intervention was developed systematically and
with transparency, following the MRC guidelines. Using this approach ensured that
gaps in the evidence base were identified at the outset and augmented with substan-
tial qualitative research. This in turn enabled the identification of the theoretical foun-
dation on which to develop the intervention as well as identification of appropriate
outcome measures that would be best used to evaluate the efficacy of the interven-
tion. Furthermore, the detailed description and subsequent manualisation of thePSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 803
intervention, including guidance on how best to tailor the content to different cogni-
tive profiles, will enable implementation across health and community settings, withthe potential for replication in other contexts beyond that of the pilot randomised
study. The design of the intervention fully incorporated the views of relevant stake-
holders, such as stroke survivors, their family members, and HCPs who provide strokecare. This allowed us to identify potential barriers and facilitators to implementing theintervention in a health/community setting, particularly as they relate to resources andexpertise of facilitators. The ubiquity of cognitive impairment following stroke(approximately 38% in the first year after stroke (Sexton et al., 2019 )) highlights the
necessity of expanding the delivery of the cognitive rehabilitation intervention, if pro-
ven efficacious, beyond the pilot RCT. However, as healthcare resources differ across
different geographical locations, both in the Republic of Ireland and internationally(McElwaine et al., 2015, 2016), this maybe a limitation to the further implementationof the cognitive rehabilitation intervention.
The design of the cognitive rehabilitation intervention may be limited by the nature
of its complexity in terms of providing an evidence base for each individual clinicalactivity (Schmidt et al., 2018 ). To circumvent this limitation, we utilised expert clinical
neuropsychological knowledge and experience in developing the minutiae of the indi-vidual intervention components. However, unlike the physical rehabilitation of function
post-stroke (Pollock et al., 2007 ), the evidence-base for cognition-focused psycho-
logical interventions for cognitive impairment following stroke has yet to be estab-lished, due in part to a paucity of high quality randomised controlled studies(Merriman, Sexton, et al., 2019 ). This in itself is a limitation and highlights the need for
well-designed studies aimed at improving cognitive function post-stroke. A barrier toconducting high quality studies is retention of stroke survivors to RCTs. A systematic
review of the efficiency of recruitment to stroke rehabilitation found that only one
third of eligible stroke survivors were randomised to rehabilitation trials, with approxi-mately 5% of participants not completing the study (McGill et al., 2020 ). Another
potential limitation to recruitment and retention may be related to stroke survivorcharacteristics, such as the severity of cognitive impairment. Initial feasibility testing ofthe StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation intervention found that, while the intervention
was feasible and acceptable to those with mild PSCI, it was not feasible to deliver the
intervention to severely impaired stroke survivors. Group-based cognitive rehabilitationis recommended for those with mild to moderate PSCI as these individuals are morelikely to have the capacity to engage with the intervention than those with severecognitive impairment (Cicerone et al., 2011 ).
A future real-world implementation limitation relates to facilitation of the interven-
tion by a clinical neuropsychologist. Currently, clinical neuropsychologists are rarelyincluded as part of the stroke rehabilitation multidisciplinary team within the Irishhealth system (McElwaine et al., 2016 ) and many other countries (Clarke, 2013 ).
However, if a pilot randomised trial of the StrokeCog cognitive rehabilitation interven-
tion proves successful, it is hoped that the findings will provide robust evidence formore substantial involvement of psychological services in stroke care. The detaileddescription of the intervention is currently being manualised to facilitate further test-ing within a pilot RCT.804 N. A. MERRIMAN ET AL.
