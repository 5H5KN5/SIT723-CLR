results participants used application frequently completed suggested actions sufficiently high rate mood scores significantly improved carried suggested actions scores depression group significantly improved using application days judging overall results obtained feel application good possibilities make significant contributions managing personal mental health management even though compare control groups mood improvement results obtained suggested users mood improved performed actions suggested allowed deduce behavioral selfregulation system able least certain degree help users improve state mind comparing scores participants posttests period time lasted days  significant improvement people nondepression group posttest results obtained significantly lower pretest results obtained depression group trial however prepare control group thus cannot deny possibility participants recovered naturally ideally followup study performed incidence mental disease strictly verify preventive effect utilization biggest issues ccbt personal mental healthcare application dropout rate survey kaltenthaler reported  percent participants drop session kaltenthaler  according extensive metaanalysis percent users pleted ccbt treatment modules karyotaki  participants dropped multiple factors example felt could rewarded sufficiently felt clinicians would recommend cases case ccbt dropout rate higher facetoface  therapy work  participants logged application range usual ccbt dropout rate result fact slightly higher expected mentioned beforehand facetoface therapy therapeutic alliance helps maintain adherence treatment lambert  also confirmed therapeutic alliance formed people embodied conversational agent bickmore  alliance could formed sabori system user virtual agent reported previous work sabori application targets people motivated mental healthcare latter aims prevent becoming victims depression anxiety therefore difficult compare dropout rate study therapeutic applications therapeutic applications described need high usage frequency provide sufficient intervention contrast approach necessarily need high usage frequency point cannot discuss whether utilization rates obtained study sufficiently high comparing obtained previous research studies preventive mental health application thus necessary take longterm considerations account limitations problems since prepare control groups able confirm effects produced user application findings follows mental condition depressed users improved day trial mental condition users recognized well pretest stable day trial results suggested application valid possibilities able help regulate mildly depressive moods needs trials analysis validate validity concept token analyze users start application choose neither study many types users would like continuously although used open participation process users logged application table results welchs method without posttest posttest pvalue participants gender male mean pretest mean logins mean standard deviation hirano indicates need conduct study make application suitable public using widespread basis application compel participants complete suggested actions furthermore since based participants decision whether would perform suggested action confounding variables might result example might perform suggested action thought mood would improved trials analysis necessary clarify points also necessary focus data missing posttest almost ticipants take posttest stopped using application less days number usage cases reported suggests strong possibility users mood improved much would taken longtime test however application provide treatment environment aimed give users opportunity execute selfmanagement natural users dropped early want continue using application force finally conduct followups effect longtime usage beyond day trial needs evaluated application made widely available conclusion presented personal preventive mental healthcare application call sabori aimed give users chance manage mental health monitor mentalphysical  regulating behavior performing actions suggested application application well
