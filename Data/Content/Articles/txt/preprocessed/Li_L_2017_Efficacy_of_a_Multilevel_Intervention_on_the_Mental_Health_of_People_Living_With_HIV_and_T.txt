confront challenges together rather individually inclusion family members provided unique environment stimulate conversations strengthen interactions within family difficult times become particularly important family members support  wellbeing plays important role process overcoming challenges together furthermore community intervention activities participants within villages could become aware familiar challenges shared families neighborhood come together form social network community support multiple layers intervention happened concurrently synergized achieving greater overall impact

limitations several limitations considered interpreting results first study conducted area large proportion former commercial plasma donors infected mids thus study results generalizable infected

disclosed status least family member possible mental health measures reported disclosed status family members different participated study fourth study faced measurement issues individuallevel data collected would able demonstrate intervention effect families communities additionally individuallevel outcomes combined effect multi layered intervention activities data collected insufficient assess
