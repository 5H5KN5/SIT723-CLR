behavior intentions considered proximal antecedent behavior according theory planned behavior ajzen  proximal antecedent reasoned behaviors prototype willingness model gerrard  interestingly despite fact studies assessed behavioral intentions rather actual behavior primary outcome quite silent regards behavioral intentions play prominent role mediating behavior change result social influence processes described theory prominent theories focused explicitly understanding intentions less likely predict behavior example gollwitzers  work implementation intentions demonstrates goal intention goal often insufficient produce followthrough goal metaanalysis gollwitzer sheeran  show implementation intentions action planning strengthen  intentions behavior implementation intentions subordinate overall behavioral intention clearly specify behavioral intention form ifthen statement results demonstrated drtbased intervention increased intentions three distinct types least produced increased likelihood following intentions latter finding potentially important means approach increases motivation change crucially makes change likely speculate simple intervention worked close intentionaction however possible increasing intentions participants engage improved action planning overall results suggest associations intentions behavior warrant attention testing predictions clinical implications results present study generally consistent predictions also demonstrated efficacy simple grounded webbased intervention despite prevalence normsbased interventions college student drinking miller  interventions nearly entirely focused providing personalized normative feedback order decrease perceived drinking norms interventions seem dvorak page health psychol  manuscript available  june  manuscript  manuscript  manuscript  manuscript based assumption individuals universally wish conform norm posits individuals times want conform norm times want deviate norm rather manipulating normative beliefs based intervention demonstrates promise giving targeted messages capitalize preexisting normative beliefs importantly messaging typically  college student alcohol interventions could easily given tailored based normative beliefs though considerable research supporting efficacy webbased normative interventions miller  also research indicating webbased normative interventions always work predicted bewick  message framing assist instances present findings suggest appropriately framed messages could delivered following normative feedback designed change normative beliefs fairly novel approach especially drinkers hold extremely high beliefs alcohol norms thus personalized normative feedback designed decrease perceived drinking norms could combined positively framed message individuals drink normatively personalized normative feedback designed increase perceived could combined negatively framed message individuals many unexplored opportunities integrate tailor messages college students receiving traditional normbased interventions ability provide intervention content circumvents several implementation barriers associated facetoface interventions highlighting promise drtinformed interventions limitations despite strengths present study several limitations noted first sample size rather small considering examining three interactions frame norms belief frame example  subjects frame norms condition thus sufficient sample size detect mediumtolarge effects consequently many effects observed reach conventional levels statistical significance though often showed theoretically consistent patterns second assessed norms using item measure percentage college students participating university although used single measure capture overall norms examined three distinct types analyses thus overall norms measure lacked precision future studies comprehensive assessments norms addition explicitly examine effects alcohol problems future research could explore effects intentionaction associations clinically relevant outcomes finally individuals study relatively welladapted adults drinking relatively nonhazardous levels thus remains seen intervention would effective among problematic drinkers present manuscript limit analyses intentions intentionbehavior associations overlap previously reported results however possible strength intentionaction influence
