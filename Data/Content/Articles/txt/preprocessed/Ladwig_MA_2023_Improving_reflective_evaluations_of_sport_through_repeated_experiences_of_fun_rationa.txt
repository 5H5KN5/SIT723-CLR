performance competitive success progressing athletes next level sport incompat ible outcomes play seen carefree goofing caring outcome perhaps negative notation term appears frequently earlier younger stages developmental model sport participation longterm athlete development model receives little attention later stages shift toward focusing performance competi tion outcomes could introduce several intraper sonal interpersonal structural constraints theorized reduce experiences ideally socalled recreational sport would provide alternative elite competitive sport adolescents wish participate primarily indeed explicit missions many recreational sport organi zations provide programming balances enjoyment performance competition time recreational nebulous term meaning characterizes recreational sport vary depend organization administrators moreover personalities expertise training often volunteer coaches influence participant experience  recreational sport leaders often current former athletes wellversed sport knowledge little coaching experience expertise positive youth development motiva tion consequently experience recreational sport programs closely resemble traditional competitive elite programsleaving many adoles cents without programming meet unique needs preferences suggest mitigate youth sport attrition alternative pathway must developed negatively experience
