Abstract
Background: Hospitalization can be a source of great stress for children and their families. In high-income
countries, there are specialized staff to help children cope using different techniques including play. However, it is a
major challenge in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to financial constraints and untrained human
resource. The objective of study was to develop and test the feasibility and acceptance of a psychology trainee-
delivered model postulated on employing play as a means of enhancing child-parent interactions leading to
reduced stress during hospitalization.
Methods: This study was conducted in the paediatric ward of a tertiary care private hospital in Pakistan. Pre-
intervention survey revealed that parental stress stemmed mainly from seeing their child irritable, distressed, or in
pain. Using a theory of change model, a play-based psychosocial intervention was developed to address these
factors. The intervention approach was informed by principles of Nurturing Care Framework and play therapy.
Children between birth and 6 years admitted in the acute care ward were eligible. The intervention was delivered
between March 2019 and December 2020 by psychology trainees who were supervised by a clinical psychologist.
The play-based sessions were delivered at the bedside and ranged from 20 to 40 min. Parents receiving the
intervention were later interviewed for their stress, child emotions, and feedback about the service using structured
surveys administered by psychology graduates. The trainees delivering the intervention were requested to provide their
feedback as a written qualitative open-ended narrative. These narratives were analyzed using an inductive approach.
Results: The survey was conducted with 223 families with about half of the sample having children under 2 years of
age. Forty-five percent of parents reported play intervention to be one of 3 key factors in improving their experience
during hospital stay. Only 5% of parents reported feeling stressed about the child illness after the intervention. Ninety to
96% parents felt respected, listened to, and understood by the therapists. Thematic analysis of the feedback by trainees
indicated the internship to be a useful experience and a new avenue for professional life whereas physicians
appreciated the interventions.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibility?
Since the intervention was being implemented in a ter-
tiary care setting in a LMIC, there were specific uncer-
tainties. Randomization of groups into intervention and
control arm was not done due to ethical and logistic
concerns about withholding a service from admitted
children/caregivers when realizing the intervention was
a need. Other uncertainties included (1) the level of
training/supervision that would be required for utilizing
psychology undergraduate level trainees to deliver the
intervention, (2) funding for resources and support from
the university hospital and service-line chief for the
quality improvement service, and (3) pediatric physi-
cians ’buy-in and confidence in the program.
/C15What are the key feasibility findings?
It is feasible to utilize psychology trainee students and
interns to deliver the play-based psychosocial interven-
tion for hospitalized children and their parents in a pri-
vate, tertiary care setting. The program allows the
trainees an opportunity to learn clinical skills cutomized
for hopsitalized children. The activities and protocols
are simple, engaging, and perceived to be effective in re-
ducing parental stress and child distress. Most parents
felt valued, respected, and cared for during their child ’s
hospitalization as a result of the support offered to them
through the intervention. Paediatric physicians also ap-
preciated the psychosocial outcomes of their patients.
/C15What are the implications of the feasibility findings
for the design of the main study?
Hospital leadership buy-in and support from the out-
set is imperative for engagement of physicians who may
not be keen to uptake psychosocial interventions in the
LMIC. Hospitals are complex settings, and one of the
most valid methods of testing care-based interventions
for in-house facilities. Broader frameworks of develop-
mental care are required that are tailored to suit the
needs of each individual family receiving services
from the health care system. Further investment for
following up with families post-discharge and forconnecting children with additional needs to specialized
outpatient therapeutic support is needed.
Background
Data from hospital admissions in the USA in 2012 indi-
cated 2 million hospital stays for children aged 17 years
and younger [ 1] while a study from the UK estimated
that pediatric admissions represent 9.9% of the child
population aged under 5 years each year nearly [ 2].
Hospitalization is a stressful time for children and their
families with disruption in their routines and uncertainty
of their condition, separation from family and commu-
nity, and painful procedures (up to 6 procedures on
average per child) and loss of control [ 3]. Young chil-
dren with limited understanding of their condition and
the procedures find it difficult to cope and if not inter-
vened experience of pain during hospitalization can have
life-long impact on their psychological well-being with
children displaying negative behavior like apathy, with-
drawal, and sleep disturbances [ 3]. This is especially con-
cerning for infants as such painful experience can
threaten to alter pain pathways and may experience
heightened pain sensation throughout life [ 4].
Recognizing the need of promoting emotional resilience
and emotional safety, high-income countries stipulate that all
children should have play and stimulation while in hospital,
e.g., in the UK, the National Association of Health Play Spe-
cialists ( https://www.nahps.org.uk/ ) recommend play while
in the USA, American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend
use of services by Certified Child Life Professionals (CCLPs)
[5] for reduced stress in children and greater experience of
families [ 6]. These professionals undergo rigorous training
embedded in developmental psych ology, family systems, and
therapeutic medical play to create an enabling environment
for children and their families during their stay for
hospitalization [ 6]. A recent review of CCLP interventions
with young children indicated play-based techniques helped
them cope, improved engagement, willingness to eat, and
they reported feeling of mastery and growth while parents re-
ported greater satisfaction wit h services and reduced distress
over time. Additional financial benefits were found due to re-
duction in procedures and overall length of stay and hence
lower costs [ 4].
As evident from literature, specialized play-based
intervention not only benefits children and their parents,
but also has the potential to affect the healthcareRasheed et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:63 Page 2 of 13
industry by improving the quality of care [ 7,8]. This is a
dire need in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)
where quality more than access is the largest cause of
morbidity and mortality [ 9]. Despite the recognition of
urgent need, unfortunately, no dedicated service-
oriented program exists in LMIC for hospitalized chil-
dren and families owing to many reasons including
shortage of resources, physician-centric model, and lack
of specialized training for such personnel. Addressing
the question will require not just effective but also feas-
ible, scalable, and sustainable intervention models maxi-
mizing advantage of existing services and programs with
similar scope.
In LMIC, there is considerable focus on early child-
hood development (ECD) to promote development of
disadvantaged children with a critical focus on the early
years via health sector. The main risk factors in these
setting include poverty, malnutrition, and lack of stimu-
lation which hinder the children to meet their develop-
mental potential. Similar to CCLP requirements, ECD
interventions employ play-based framework to nurture
parent-child interactions derived from principles of de-
velopmental psychology, family systems, and public
health [ 10]. The Nurturing Care Framework (NCF) [ 11]
calls for a stable environment for children for learning
and development through responsive care and emotional
support (UN, n.d.). Nurturing care has inter-related
components than can be applied to hospital setting, in-
cluding: caregiving (health and psychosocial needs), re-
sponsiveness (parental sensitivity and sensitivity and
responsiveness when child is irritable or feeling low), nu-
trition (improve appetite of sick children and encourage-
ment to take appropriate food), stimulation (singing,
talking, playing, laughing), and safety (the need to feel
safe and secure in a new environment). NCF calls for en-
abling families to providing nurturing care to their chil-
dren through strengthening their relationships with the
children. It also emphasizes empowerment of vulnerable
families who may need additional support [ 12]. Engaging
with families to meet their needs also requires a skilled
workforce. A brief summary of the framework has been
added as a supplementary file .
The field of ECD provided an excellent opportunity of
leveraging the similarity of theoretical framework to ad-
dress the specific needs of hospitalized children and
their families in a tertiary care hospital in a Pakistan.
The authors sought to explore the potential of utilizing
clinical psychology students during their apprenticeship
as specialist workforce to improve care for hospitalized
children when delivering a play-based intervention.
These students were selected to take advantage of their
knowledge and competency-based training pertaining to
human interactions, therapeutic relationships, and play
therapy. The objective of the study was to test thefeasibility and acceptance of the intervention employing
play to strengthen parent-child interactions as a means
of reduced stress during hospitalization. The study
aimed to address the following research question: is a
play-based psychosocial intervention delivered by psych-
ology trainees for reducing stress in young hospitalized
children (birth to 6 years) and their families in a tertiary
care health setting in Pakistan feasible and acceptable to
key stakeholders?
Methods
Site and sample
This quality improvement (QI) initiative was conducted
as a feasibility study in the pediatric ward of Aga Khan
University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, Pakistan —a 700-
bedded tertiary care private tertiary care and teaching
hospital located in the largest and most populated (~ 28
million people) city of Pakistan serving two provinces.
Academic clinical programs form an important part of
the service. The pediatric ward has approximately 120
beds with about 8000 yearly admissions and acute ill-
nesses; mainly respiratory infections constitute for 70%
of the admissions in the general ward with the average
length of stay of 3 –4 days. The nurse to bed ratio is 1:6;
they are not trained to use play as a distraction with sick
children nor is any cadre available to do so. Any child
and the family up to 6 years of age admitted in the gen-
eral ward with acute illness were eligible for the inter-
vention. Approval was sought from the Ethical Research
Committee of the Aga Khan University (AKU) prior to
commencing the study.
Intervention
Development
A survey was conducted prior to the intervention with
221 caregivers of hospitalized children to evaluate fac-
tors affecting parental stress during hospitalization, child
emotions and behaviors, and parental knowledge and
practices of ECD (Table 1). Parental Stress Survey form
related to child illness was informed by previous work
by Tehrani et al. [ 13] and Yang et al. [ 14]. Responses
were categorized and rated according to a Likert scale of
five degrees: extremely stressful, moderately stressful,
mildly stressful, not stressful, and not applicable. An
open-ended item was also included requesting to share
their experience and what they appreciated the most
during their stay. Child behaviors and emotions were
measured using items from the Parent Stress Question-
naire used by Yang et al. [ 14], a parent-reported measure
of child behaviors across 10 different items. Items were
rated as experienced most of the time, some of the time,
not at all, or not observed. Demographic data was also
collected using a structured interview, covering educa-
tion of the caregiver, language spoken at home, and areaRasheed et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:63 Page 3 of 13
of residence and knowledge about child development.
The Caregiver Knowledge of Child Development Inven-
tory (CKCDI) was used to gauge maternal knowledge
and practices about child ’s development [ 15]. An exam-
ination of the CKCDI has revealed the internal
consistency of 0.61 and higher maternal education to be
a predictor of a higher score indicating validity [ 15]. The
results indicated factors related to the child illness espe-
cially seeing the child in pain (79.1%) and the child ’s ir-
ritability (59.1%) were perceived to be the most stressful.
Out of a total score of 20 on the maternal knowledge
survey, the mean score at baseline was 6.46 ± 0.44. Withrespect to practices, the data indicated that the most
popular activity was playtime (60% of mothers and 74%
of fathers engaged in this), followed by singing songs
(58% of mothers, 33% of fathers) and reading books
(27% of mothers, 40% of fathers). This highlighted the
need for educating parents about play activities.
The survey led the investigators to conceptualize a
play-based parenting intervention for reduced stress in
young children as parents were not well-equipped to use
play material for young children ’s learning given the role
of play for reducing anxiety and trauma in children
thereby also reducing caregiver s ’anxiety [ 16]. Further-
more, play-based care allows healthcare staff to gauge a
child’s developmental milestones status and screen for
any additional requirements of the child and their care-
givers [ 17].
The survey was followed by a theory of change (ToC)
model was developed for the intervention clearly outlin-
ing family-centered care service whereby parents of chil-
dren birth to 6 years old were to be coached by
psychology trainees for nurturing interactions with their
children with no charge to the family (Fig. 1).
The intervention was informed by principles of
Nurturing Care Framework (NCF) [ 10,11]a n dp l a y
therapy [ 18]. The scope of NCF was expanded and
customized the content, training, and delivery ap-
proach to cater to the speci alized health and medical
needs of the beneficiaries. The intervention approach
was borrowed from the Care for Child Development
module developed by the UNICEF/WHO [ 19]. The
package provides guidanc e to healthcare providers to
help parents to enhance responsive interactions with
young using play. The intervention is aimed at
strengthening the relationship between parent and
child while also providing stimulation. For the inter-
vention package, activities were designed after an ex-
tensive literature review of play that helped children in
regulating and reducing their stress via play-based
nurturing interactions [ 2]. A manual was created cov-
ering four domain of development: physical, cognitive,
emotional, and psychosocial and communication
across five different age groups: (1) newborn to 6
months, (2) 7 –12 months, (3) 13 –24 months , (4) 25 –
36 months, and (5) 48 –72 months. The emotional do-
main was kept separate and had a significant number
of activities. Since hospitalization is an emotionally
taxing event for both children and families the investi-
gators felt it needed attention on its own. The activ-
ities from this domain were informed by the principles
of play therapy which uses play as a medium of ex-
pression for children. Play is also helpful in assessing
emotional distress while building therapeutic relation-
ship with the child. The intervention materials are
summarized in Table 2.Table 1 Socio-demographic characteristics of pre-intervention

Recruitment, training, and supervision of trainees
A memorandum of understanding was made with a
psychology department of a humanities university for
formal approval of internship of their students following
meeting of the PI, the service line chief with the Director
of the Psychology Institute at the university. The trainees
were recruited through interviews by the clinical super-
visors (study investigators) and were evaluated for their
interest in working with children along with other core
skills such as communication, rapport-building, family
counseling, and motivational interviewing. A batch of
students was required to rotate for 6 weeks and
complete 100 h before the next batch joined. The intern-
ship hours contributed toward their apprenticeship
requirements.
The trainees received a 4-day training in their first
week. The first 2 days were focused on imparting the
theoretical concepts of the core concepts of therapy, im-
portance of play, behavioral modification techniques,
discrete observations of children and parents,
familiarization with the intervention materials, and
forms and protocol for disinfection of toys. This was
followed by practical demonstration and practice.
Trainees observed their supervisor conducting the ses-
sion after which they were asked to take sessions in pairs
first and then independently. Once trainees started
working independently, they had weekly in-depth super-
vision meetings for 2 h end of the week (Friday). The
meeting entailed discussing difficult cases, countertrans-
ference, and grievances to keep building their knowledge
and skills. Once a week, interns were also observed via
supervision observation checklist developed for the
study. The checklist was focused on different skills, e.g.,
intervening with an individual child required being pre-
pared for the session, rapport building skills, structuring
the session, communicating the purpose of the sessionand recommendations to the child and the family. Other
skills included application of core conditions of therapy,
setting boundary, and being sensitive to cultural differ-
ence with the families. The feedback was shared with the
trainees in the in-depth debriefing meeting. At the com-
pletion of the internship trainees were expected to sub-
mit a case study to gauge their clinical knowledge. The
case report was similar to the assignments in clinical
psychology whereby detailed case history of a selected
client is reported along with interventions completed
and recommendations. The case report was evaluated by
the clinical supervisor and also shared with their univer-
sity. An evaluation report was also submitted to their
university supervisor highlighting strengths and areas of
improvement of the trainees. The evaluation reported
areas of their technical domains: conceptualization, as-
sessment, and intervention skills and personal and pro-
fessional domain: communication and interpersonal
skills, being a team player and respect for cultural diver-
sity, informed by the framework for internship by
American Psychological Association [ 20].
Intervention procedures
While originally designed to be a combination of group
and individual sessions, groups were not feasible within
the setting owing to space constraints, infection control
guidelines, children ’s conditions, and other activities of
priority to the child ’s health, e.g., medication timings or
lab tests. The intervention sessions were delivered at
bedside, 4 days a week as per the trainees ’university
schedule. A standard protocol was developed for the
intervention for selection of activities and coaching the
parents to play with their children using these activities
intending to strengthen their relationship. Families were
approached for the play-based sessions if the child was
awake and the physician round had been completed soTable 2 Intervention materials

the family would be at ease. Each session lasted between
20 and 40 min depending on the child ’s developmental
stage and mental state. The session was designed to in-
clude an ice-breaker activity followed by main activity
and closure selected based on the developmental needs
of the child assessed on observation. The parents were
advised to carry out the activities with the child. Be-
tween the sessions, a thorough activity of disinfecting
toys was ensured, based on AKU DIPHE (Department of
Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology) recom-
mendations. At the end of the day, the supervisor would
complete rounds with the trainees and answer any quer-
ies that the parents may have. The round was also an
opportunity to assess parental satisfaction with the inter-
vention and note any gaps in the recommendations pro-
vided by the trainee. Notes were added to the medical
record file of the child for review by the physician by the
supervisor. Subsequently, the supervisor also shared a
detailed report of the child ’s developmental profile with
the referring physician. The report was an assessment of
the child based on clinical observations including mental
state examination of the child (cognitive, mental and
functional status) and developmental status. Intervention
activities conducted, response of the child, and recom-
mendations were also documented. A weekly monitoring
form was created toward the end of the study to under-
stand the on-going trends and intervene if needed.
Feedback from stakeholders
Several methods were used to seek feedback from the
participants: parents, trainees, and physicians.
Parents
Data was collected as a survey by two trained research
assistants with background in Psychology between Octo-
ber and December 2019. The inclusion criteria were (1)
children ’s age (1 month to 6 years), (2) hospital stay of
at least 24 h, (3) children admitted in general ward, and
(4) having received at least one play therapy session. All
eligible families were approached for feedback after
reviewing the list of children admitted in the ward who
met the criteria. The exclusion criteria included all chil-
dren above 6 years. The families were approached by the
data collectors for feedback in the ward. The primary
variables of interest included parental report of reduced
negative emotional affect of the child and stress in par-
ents using the same measure as in the pre-intervention
survey. Parental feedback about the intervention was
also sought on a structured form on a sub-sample prior
to discharge by the trainees.
Trainees
Trainees played a central role in the program implemen-
tation that was premised on partnership with theeducation sector, and hence, their feedback was solicited
to gauge benefits they accumulated. They were required
to provide an open-ended qualitative narrative feedback
about strengths and areas to improve once their intern-
ship ended.
Physicians
Recognizing that physician role buy-in was important
for feasibility of the intervention their feedback was also
sought. Consultant physicians were requested to provide
feedback via email when a report of the child seen was
shared with them. Some of them also shared their
experience on the departmental social media group.
Data analysis
Data entry operators compiled the collected data on
Microsoft Office Excel. Data was entered and analyzed
using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, ver-
sion 15.0) by an independent statistician. Demographic
variables included child gender, child disease group,
length of stay, maternal education, maternal knowledge
of ECD, residence, and language spoken at home. Values
were presented in the form of mean ± SD and frequen-
cies with percentages for continuous and categorical var-
iables respectively.
Thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative data
of trainee narratives and physician feedback using an in-
ductive approach. The narratives were coded by two
team members (first two authors) closely involved with
the implementation of study. The scripts were coded by
two individuals independently and then finalized after
agreement in a face-to-face meeting. Codes were also
mutually agreed in the agreement meetings. For quality
assurance, a third member, an experienced developmen-
tal psychologist and independent of the implementation
reviewed the codes. Her understanding of the underlying
developmental processes provided a different lens to the
analysis. Moreover, the first author has considerable ex-
perience with qualitative methodology to evaluate imple-
mentation of parenting interventions allowing to pick up
nuisances. A thematic map was created to further evalu-
ate the relationship between codes.
Results
Parental feedback
Data of 223 participants who received intervention was
analyzed for the study (Table 3). About a third of chil-
dren were in the age group of birth to 1 year (31.8%),
were slightly higher in number of females (56.95), and
majority were from the acute illness group (72.2%). The
median length of stay was 4 days. Out of a total score of
20 on the maternal knowledge survey, the mean score
was quite low (4.3 ± 0.29).Rasheed et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:63 Page 7 of 13
Table 4shows frequencies and percentages of parental
stress due to child illness. Results indicate items marked
as“extremely stressful ”by parents and “most of the
time”for children. Most negative emotions in parents
stemmed from seeing their child in pain or distress (6 –
7%), as well as uncertainty about the child ’s health in the
future (10.6%) and the possibility of a relapse (14.5%
marked as “extremely stressful ”).
About 45% of the parents ( N= 94) reported play inter-
vention as one of the three key factors that made their
experience positive during the stay. Some parents re-
ported that play helped to distract their child from thepain, helped the child calm down, while some suggested
that play should be an integral part of pediatric care ser-
vices. One parent (interview ID 44) reported “The play
[activity] is effective. It was the only thing that made me
feel good about my experience [in the hospital]. ”
Parent feedback collected by the trainees also showed
similar trends. Though only 20% of the parents were
captured due to time constraints at discharge, majority
reported being satisfied with the intervention. Ninety-
two percent agreed/strongly agreed that they felt satis-
fied, that they were listened to and respected by the
therapist, and that the therapist cared about their child ’s
well-being; 96% agreed to feeling comfortable talking to
the therapist and felt relaxed after their session; 94% felt
that their relationship with their child was strengthened;
and 85.5% agreed/strongly agreed that they were able to
focus on their children as well thanks to the program
(not applicable to 10% of participants with an only
child).
Trainees feedback
Though designed initially only for local students pursu-
ing a Master ’s degree, the program also attracted several

sciences background. Out of 33 trainees, 9 were under-
graduate level students and 24 were enrolled for their
Master ’s degree; 5 were international students. One of
the trainees was male, and 32 trainees were female.
Findings from analysis of trainees ’feedback (summa-
rized in Fig. 2) indicated that they appreciated identify-
ing new avenues in clinical psychology and realizing the
importance of parental interaction and the importance
of their cooperation and willingness.
A trainee (October 2019) stated, “The work experience
and exposure was remarkable; the supervision provided
was incredibly supportive and helpful. Mistakes were
highlighted, and weekly feedback was so beneficial. Ini-
tially, it was a bit challenging but over time, it became
fun to work with different types of audience. Every client
helped us to grow in their own way. ”
They also reported that this was a “new, much-needed
exposure ”and that holistic care should be a part of every
hospital in Pakistan ( “The internship made me realize
the need for child therapists and psychologists in the
Pakistani medical system to provide holistic treatment
that caters to the needs of both, the parents and the chil-
dren”, trainee, July 2018). One of the trainees ’sister was
admitted to the ward for 10 days during the internship.
The trainee practiced play therapy techniques with her
sister and reported that she could “vouch for the tech-
niques …they enhanced my skills as a person and as a
psychologist. The activities played a significant role ininstilling hope in my sister, as well as improving the
bond between us. ”
Some of the success stories included feedback from
the international students. They felt the principles of
play-based interventions resonated with their work in
the USA and Canada —“I am now back in the USA. I
will be working as a volunteer for play therapy at the
Boston Children ’s Hospital. I am so impressed that
this concept has been introduced at AKUH because I
see that play and creative arts therapy is an important
part of healing. As [an AKUH pediatrician] said, once
t h ep l a yt h e r a p i s t sa n dp s y c h o l o g i s t sg oa n dt a l kt o
the patients, that ’s when the medicine starts working. ”
(Trainee, September 2018).
The other international student trainee (May 2019)
remarked, “Being born and raised in East Africa, and
now living in Canada, even with a wide range of experi-
ences in certain areas, I would have never found an op-
portunity such as this one anywhere else …[it] has
opened my eyes to the path I want to take in the future
…Being here and undergoing all the responsibilities has
assured me that I truly enjoy helping others, and teach-
ing/training medical practitioners in order to increase
their depth of knowledge in a holistic manner. This way
there is a larger population of individuals who are well
versed in multiple areas including play therapy and can
help more patients daily, compared to one or two of us
who are currently working alone. Overall, it has
Fig. 2 Thematic analysis map of trainee feedbackRasheed et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:63 Page 9 of 13
definitely been an eye-opening and life-changing experi-
ence for which I will be eternally grateful. ”
Suggestions for improving the program included redu-
cing the time duration of disinfection ( “[better to] assign
nurses or any other [lower level] staff who could be re-
sponsible for disinfecting the toys properly …thereby
giving interns the time and opportunity to choose an ac-
tivity or toy in accordance with the needs of the next pa-
tient”, trainee feedback, July 2018) and including a
variety of toys to cater to the patient population from
different parts of the country ( “…increase the kinds of
toys and interventions available, especially for kids older
than 10 years. Adding picture books or simple story
books, with languages like Sindhi, might also be benefi-
cial”trainee feedback, December 2019).
Raising awareness was also emphasized upon and the
role of all health providers for nurturing interaction with
children. The students felt the success of the program
could be disseminated widely given potential benefits. A
trainee (July 2018) suggested, “parents should be more
involved in the activities, psychoeducation of parents
should be the main focus. Staff (primarily nurses) should
be trained in basic therapeutic techniques, helping them
to create a positive bond with the patients, and support-
ing children when the therapist is not available. This will
reduce patient and parent anxiety in the hospital. ”
Physician feedback
Core themes of gratitude, patient support, improvement,
detailed feedback, and recommendations were identified
from physician feedback. Most of the physicians who
responded on email were thankful for the observation
reports that were sent to them and were grateful for the
continuous support. They also observed changes in chil-
dren, such as decrease in anxiety and increase in curios-
ity and social interaction. Physicians also recommended
that children and families would benefit from stimula-
tion due to chronic conditions. Overall, the implementa-
tion of the program was appreciated by the consultants
as well.
A pediatric oncologist appreciated that “It’s very en-
couraging to have this kind of service available in The
Children ’s Hospital, ”while a gastroenterologist noted
that the “explanations about the child ’s psychosocial
profile are really helpful. ”Some physicians requested a
long-term planning “Maybe we can sit down and de-
velop a plan where we have someone who works very
closely with our patients as these patients require years
of therapy in certain situations. ”
A cardiologist noted on the departmental Facebook
group (April 2018): “…yesterday I gave a consult to [the
psychologist] for 2 patients. One is a post-op cardiac pa-
tient who yesterday morning was quiet and not inter-
active. The parents were extremely worried about herchange of personality. Today after just one session by
[the psychologist] I could not recognize the child –
interactive, playful, fearless. She kept pointing to this
note by [the psychologist] (a teaching note for the par-
ents) and telling her dad to follow the instructions!
Thank you so much for starting the play therapy service
in the Children ’s Hospital. ”
An oncologist (May 2018) responded to the above
comment: “Agree 100% with this …seeing [the psychol-
ogists] interacting with our patient was heartening …play
therapy project is much needed by the Children ’s Hos-
pital –seeing Child Life work so closely with oncology
patients, I always felt this void here until now. Appreci-
ate [the investigators] for creating this. ”
Key feasibility findings
Recommendations for modification to the program and
the way forward are summarized in Table 5.
Discussion
The findings indicated that a play-based psychosocial
intervention following principles of Nurturing Care
Framework and play therapy in a hospital setting and
utilizing trainee students was acceptable as parents per-
ceived it to reduce children ’s affective state and reduce
their own stress related to child illness. The finding
aligns with literature from high-income countries where
play-based techniques have consistently demonstrated
effects for reduced parental anxiety and more positive af-
fects in hospitalized children [ 21]. Coaching parents
could have contributed toward child ’s experience of
positive feelings as provision of warm and responsive
care [ 22–24]. Family-focused interventions lead to satis-
faction with healthcare services as well as better coping
in children and parents [ 25]. It has also been found out
that anxiety in children also decreases during hospital
play with and without family members being present
[26]. However, teasing out these differences was not pos-
sible with the current study design but could be consid-
ered to design a trial in the future. With regard to
acceptance, about half of the parents rated it as one of
the three factors that added value to their experience
during hospitalization. This is encouraging and a low-
cost investment could improve the patient experience
while adding to the reputation of the service providers.
Moreover, from the hospital ’s perspective, an important
outcome of the intervention has been inclusion of
parent-child interaction as part of nursing assessment of
the child at admission and adoption of the play-based
intervention package as a default service by the hospital.
This will help children with becoming comfortable earl-
ier on and getting familiarized with medical procedures
while helping to understand the effects of hospitalization
and disease on children [ 27].Rasheed et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:63 Page 10 of 13
An important observation in the study was the dur-
ation of sessions ranging from 20 to 40 min. We de-
duced from our experience of implementing the
intervention that children who were sick took relatively
longer to engage in the activity than children who are
not sick (e.g., in the community). The response of the
child was dependent on his/her affect and also parental
engagement. The aim of the session was to enhance
parent-child interaction and continue the session till
both found it mutually enjoyable interaction. This may
have implications for scalability but we feel it is import-
ant to let parents and children have enough time to en-
gage in meaningful interaction for the intervention to be
effective.
The study yields possible pathways for the continu-
ation of positive ECD practices in a hospital setting
with a risk of compromised child development espe-
cially in the absence of specialized training programs
by leveraging existing resources. Using students as a
workforce opens new avenues for them to comple-
ment healthcare. Exposure to early childhood training,
such as teaching training, internship influences career
choice and perspective on interaction with children
[28]. Youth, especially females, can be importantagents for community mobilization, social awareness,
and social transformation [ 29].
Moreover, such an approach can also support at-
tainment of several SDGs. SDG 3, supporting holistic
care as an essential quality healthcare service, is
achieved when hospitalization may push behind these
children academically, but play-based psychosocial
intervention may help them acquire new skills and
get equitable learning opportunities promising inclu-
sivity and delivery of SDG 4, i.e., quality education.
This also encapsulates SDG 4 —development of youth
skills for career development. The female-led model
requiring compassion as a core ingredient also sup-
ports gender equity (SDG 5, i.e., gender equality)
where communities see it as a women ’sj o ba n di s
accepted by families. SDG 17 calls for establishing
partnerships for strengthening the means of imple-
mentation and ensuring sustainable service develop-
ment. Partnership with th e education sector opened
opportunities for the investi gators to utilize the skills
of university students, specializing in psychology. The
investigators believe that universities can play a
major role to fill the gap of paid human resources
for psychosocial interventions.Table 5 Key findings from feedback of parents, trainees, physicians
Domain Key findings/way forward
Randomization Randomization can be done; one possibility is to examine play activities, with and without parental coaching stratified
by disease groups as either acute or complex. Another possibility is to ranomized groups for follow-up support post-
discharge. A group with no intervention will not be possible as all children/families will be offered this service upon
admission into the ward and withholding will be unethical.
Intervention implementation Dedicated senior staff are required to oversee the execution of the program and follow a formalized process of
monitoring and evaluation as planned for quarterly meetings. Though started as a pilot service, the program evolved
very quickly and staff were stretched thin to incorporate regular feedback and changes.
Intervention content No change is recommended for the content. One addition can be to encourage special education services for children
with prolonged stay or repeated admissions.
Intervention mode Individual bedside sessions are feasible, particularly compared to groups, due to space constraints and privacy
concerns. Groups also enhance risk of infection.
Intervention delivery staff Students, preferably enroled in Master ’s programmes are suitable for the intervention delivery. Undergraduates can be
utilized but not as core delivery staff.
Intervention delivery forms The content needs simplification and length of forms needs to be reduced. An additional form is required for quick
screening of developmental and emotional issues to help trainees frame their intervention plan. The forms need to be
co-designed with the key stakeholder who will use the data, e.g. physicians for child health outcomes and university
supervisors for academic outcomes of the trainees.
Engaging trainee students Continue to share reports with university management. Make more efforts to engage university supervisors through
in-person meetings. It is an important aspect to assure quality and professionalism by students while imparting a sense
of accountability. Ideally, after every rotation so lessons learnt from one should be incorporated into the next rotation.
Engaging physicians Individual reports are very time-consuming and feedback on emails may not always be received. Having in-person
monthly meetings while sharing trends with physicians aggregated by disease groups can be more effective. Incorpor-
ate their feedback into the on-going programme.
Continuation of services for
childrenChildren with additional needs should be identified during the intervention and connected for out-patient follow-up.
Evaluation Resources are needed for meeting families post-discharge and collecting their insights about the intervention. Meeting
minutes with university supervisors and physicians can also add to the process evaluation of the intervention. A log of
supervisor observations can be maintained covering their weekly in-depth meetings and rounds. To determine effect-
iveness, a trial is recommended.Rasheed et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:63 Page 11 of 13
A potential limitation was no direct observational assess-
ment of child behaviors, eliminating any possible biases of
the parent report. Another limitation was that in-depth in-
terviews were not feasible with the stakeholders due to re-
source and setting constraints. Qualitative interviews would
have yielded valuable insights. However, investigators were
integrally involved with the study and participants and doc-
umented their reflections and feedback. An interesting per-
spective would be to follow-up children later to explore if
the parenting skills imparted during the hospitalization
were continued at home.
While promising, the results cannot be generalized to
a different setting. This was a private care hospital where
overall adequate care was being provided compared to
other public care settings in the country which can also
impact parent stress during child ’s hospitalization. How-
ever, the authors are also working to replicate the model
in less developed parts of the country. Moving forward,
courses can be designed in collaboration with training
centers for early childhood education to create a special-
ized workforce for healthcare settings. Further analyses
would require understanding parent-child interaction as
a disease modifier to advocate for integration of such in-
terventions in LMICs health sector. Nonetheless, the
study helps in understanding the role that NCF plays in
a hospital setting. Through this pilot, we demonstrated
feasibility of delivery of play-based interventions by
trainees in improving patient experience in an acute set-
ting. This was done through partnering with a local uni-
versity. Such an approach can be cost-effective in
resource-constrained health systems, allowing the inte-
gration of psychosocial aspects of well-being and devel-
opment into health care.
Conclusions
Litarature from high-income countries suggests
that provision of play-based services in hospital setting
reduces anxiety and stress in both parents and children
given caregivers of hospitalized children are also in need
of emotional support. These psychosocial needs are
often met by different professionals in a hospital setting
in high-income countries. In LMICs, ECD practitioners
and psychologists can use play-based techniques for the
provision of psychosocial support to children and their
families in a hospital in resource-constrained settings.
Direct involvement of parents in providing psychosocial
stimulation children decreases stress in both in a hos-
pital setting, which is congruent with the findings of
ECD research. Trainee students can deliver psychosocial
support interventions under supervision in these settings
and simultaneously gain clinical experience from the
programme. Utilizing trainees for play-based psycho-
social support for hospitalized children is feasible; how-
ever, to determine intervention effectiveness, furtherinvestment of resources and a randomized trial is
required.
