Abstract
Background: Increasing levels of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental health problems, high rates of
unhealthy behaviours and health inequalities remain major public health challenges worldwide. In the context of
increasing urbanisation, there is an urgent need to understand how evidence that living environments shape
health, wellbeing and behaviour can be used to design and deliver healthy environments in local urban settings.
The Healthy New Town (HNT) programme implemented in England from 2015 consists of ten major housing
developments that aim to improve population health through healthy design principles, new models for
integrating health and social care and the creation of strong and connected communities. The programme
provides a natural experiment in which to investigate the effects on health, wellbeing and inequalities of large-scale
interventions targeting the wider social determinants of health.
Methods: The research described in this protocol aims to examine the feasibility of a larger study to assess the
longer-term health impacts of HNTs, by addressing two research questions: (1) what are the similarities and
differences in the HNT programme developments, processes, contexts and expected impacts and outcomes across
HNT sites? and (2) how feasible is the use of data from routine sources and existing HNT evaluations and as the
baseline for a definitive study to assess impact on health, wellbeing, behavioural and economic outcomes and
programme processes? The research will consist of (a) participatory systems mapping with stakeholders to produce
a theoretical framework for a longer-term study on the HNT programme, (b) synthesis of existing qualitative data
from local HNT evaluations to understand local processes and intervention mechanisms, (c) scoping local and
routinely available data to establish a baseline and feasibility for a longer-term study of health and economic
outcomes, and (d) building relationships and recruiting HNT sites into the proposed research.
Discussion: The proposed research will produce a theoretical framework and assess the feasibility of a definitive
study of outcomes of the HNT programme. This research is necessary to understand how longer-term health,
wellbeing, behavioural and economic outcomes can be measured, and to inform a definitive study to generate
evidence on the effectiveness of the HNT programme.

Background
Improving health and reducing health inequalities re-
main major global public health challenges. Increasing
levels of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental
health problems, rising levels of obesity and high rates of
physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, smoking and harmful
alcohol consumption are placing increasing pressure on
health services [ 1,2]. The costs associated with smoking,
physical inactivity and overweight and obesity, for ex-
ample, are estimated to be around £12.6 billion annually
in England and Wales in the UK [ 3]. These problems are
compounded by the clustering of NCDs, mental health
problems and health risk behaviours in the most disad-
vantaged groups [ 4,5], as well as multi-morbidity within
a population that is getting older [ 6]. There is an urgent
need to find effective approaches to prevention, particu-
larly upstream interventions which impact on the social
determinants of health [ 7].
Health and health behaviour are influenced by interac-
tions between characteristics of individuals and their
places of residence [ 8–10]. Changes to specific compo-
nents of local environments can improve physical and
mental wellbeing, promote healthy behaviours and re-
duce health inequalities [ 11–13]. Embedding healthy
principles in town and city planning is endorsed in
WHO recommendations to ‘place health and health
equity at the heart of governance and planning ’[10].
However, the processes and longer-term impacts of cre-
ating healthy urban environments are less well under-
stood [ 14]. Developing an understanding of how
characteristics of urban environments interact as whole
systems to affect health and behavioural outcomes is a
pressing priority [ 14].
The Healthy New Town (HNT) programme was
funded by the English National Health Service in 2016
for 3 years. The programme brings together partners in
local government, housebuilding, local communities and
healthcare to offer improved choices and opportunities
for healthy living through healthy placemaking. The
HNT programme draws upon evidence from research
on characteristics of healthy living environments [ 15]
and recommendations from leading global agencies, in-
cluding the WHO recommendations on health and
health equity for governance and planning [ 10], and
United Nations recommendations for safe, inclusive, re-
silient and sustainable cities to promote healthy lives
and wellbeing [ 16]. Previous programmes and research
studies, including those related to the European Healthy
Cities movement [ 17] have drawn upon this evidence
base and associated recommendations with a focus on
very large metropolitan areas [ 15]. The scale of the sites
in the HNT programme differs from these programmes
and research studies as it focuses on developments
within smaller towns or urban areas.HNTs are 10 major housing developments across Eng-
land, referred to by NHS England as ‘HNT demonstrator
sites ’. These HNT demonstrator sites were selected from
an initial 114 expressions of interest in 2016. Sites were
selected to represent a diverse cross-section of housing
developments planned across England, including those
from high-volume builders and housing associations,
across a wide range of land values [ 18]. Sites were also
selected to represent diversity in sociodemographic char-
acteristics and health needs. NHS England has an-
nounced that there are plans for over 76,000 new homes
across the ten HNT sites, with potential total capacity
for approximately 170,000 residents [ 18]. The size and
nature of the planned developments and the timescales
for their completion vary considerably. For example, the
planned development of 885 houses to be built by 2023
at the HNT site in Barton, Oxfordshire is relatively small
compared to the development of 15,000 houses planned
to be built in Ebbsfleet, Kent by 2035 [ 18]. Further de-
tails of the new housing developments planned at each
HNT demonstrator site are provided below under the
‘Settings and interventions ’section.
HNTs are united by a shared aim to improve popula-
tion health and reduce inequalities by applying healthy
design principles that cover movement and transport,
green and social infrastructure, the local economy, food
choices and placemaking [ 19]. The three HNT
programme priorities are: (1) planning and designing a
healthy built environment, (2) creating innovative
models of healthcare, and (3) encouraging strong and
connected communities [ 20]. These broad programme
priorities are common to the 10 HNT demonstrator
sites. However, the diversity of local circumstances dic-
tates that each site will have a differing list of specific
priorities and different perspectives on the most suitable
type of interventions and services that can be delivered
to achieve these priorities. Examples of specific interven-
tions are provided below under the ‘Settings and inter-
ventions ’section.
At the outset of the HNT programme there was no
formal plan or funding arrangement in place to evaluate
the longer-term impact of the HNT programme on
health, wellbeing and economic outcomes. However,
some HNT sites had commissioned academic partners
to evaluate the impacts of specific interventions and pro-
cesses of the HNT programme. Five HNT sites engaged
in a formative evaluation of the programme which ended
in March 2019. Site leads, funders and evaluation part-
ners at these sites —Barking Riverside, Bicester, Darling-
ton, Ebbsfleet and Whitehill & Bordon —form the HNT
Evaluation Collaborative (HNTEC). The HNTEC was
formed to facilitate learning across sites and to explore
opportunities for further evaluation, including evaluation
of the longer-term impacts of the HNT programme onWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 2 of 13
health and wellbeing outcomes. As academic partners of
the Evaluation Collaborative, a team of researchers from
the University of East London and Newcastle University
(the authors) sought and received funding from the Na-
tional Institute of Health Research to investigate the
feasibility of a study of the longer-term impacts of the
HNT programme. The research team is working collab-
oratively with the HNTEC, but we do not have a role in
the planning, design or implementation of the HNT
programme. This protocol describes the feasibility re-
search which was planned with a focus on the 5 HNT
sites within the HNTEC.
The HNT programme provides a natural experiment in
which to investigate the effects on health and wellbeing of
large-scale, whole system interventions. Research on inter-
ventions addressing the social determinants of health re-
quires methods that recognise the complexity of pathways
towards impact [ 21]. Natural experiments can provide
valuable evidence on the impact of large-scale interven-
tions [ 22], and a whole systems approach can investigate
pathways to health improvement over the longer term
[23]. Previous evaluations of large-scale, area-based inter-
ventions such as New Deal for Communities [ 24] and the
Healthy Communities Challenge Fund [ 25], describe the
importance of setting realistic targets for similar schemes
based on their period of funding. HNT sites have broad
programme objectives which are not measurable within
the 3 years of current funding allocated. For example, re-
ducing the gap in healthy life expectancy could take over
10 years to be demonstrated.
A robust evaluation should ask: what happens when
an intervention is ‘implemented across a range of con-
texts, populations and subpopulations? ’[26] And, where
there is evidence that an intervention has had an effect
on health outcomes, the evaluation should ask ‘how have
these effects come about? ’[26]. The HNT programme
offers a novel opportunity to adopt a whole systems ap-
proach to understanding the complexities of implement-
ing a programme of area-based interventions targeting
the social determinants of health in real world, dynamic
settings across several sites in England.
Aim
The research described in this protocol aims to examine
the feasibility of a larger study to assess the long-term
health impacts of HNTs which can then inform the fu-
ture planning, development and implementation of
healthy urban environments.
Research questions
To determine the feasibility of a larger study to assess
long-term health impacts of HNTs, it is first necessary
to understand more about the developments and inter-
ventions taking place at each of the HNT sites. Thisincludes understanding the ways in which each HNT site
has interpreted HNT priorities and plans to act upon
them in the context of their site-specific priorities. The
research outlined in this protocol therefore aims to an-
swer the following research question:
1. What are the similarities and differences in HNT
programme developments, activities and processes,
contexts and expected impacts and outcomes across
the 5 HNT sites that form the HNT Evaluation
Collaborative?
The feasibility of a future study on the longer-term im-
pacts of the HNT programme is dependent on the avail-
ability of quantitative data, either held locally at HNT
sites or from routinely available sources, to form a base-
line against which any changes in health outcomes can
be assessed. Similarly, the feasibility of a longer-term
process evaluation of the HNT programme is dependent
on the availability of qualitative and quantitative data on
the processes and mechanisms through which HNT
programme activities and interventions operate. There-
fore, the second research question to be addressed by
the research detailed in this protocol is as follows:
2. How feasible is the use of data from routine sources
and existing HNT evaluation data as the baseline
for a longer-term study to assess impact on health,
wellbeing, economic, and behavioural outcomes;
programme processes; and mechanisms?
Objectives
To answer these research questions, the research de-
scribed in this protocol will need to achieve the follow-
ing objectives:
1. To produce systems maps for a sample of sites
within the HNT Evaluation Collaborative,
illustrating processes and expected outcomes from
HNT activities and developing a theoretical
framework for longer-term research. These systems
maps will contribute to a more detailed and holistic
understanding of the processes and mechanisms
through which HNT programme activities and in-
terventions operate, and the outcomes that the
HNT programme is expected to influence.
2. To synthesise any avail able qualitative data
produced through existing local evaluations and
to test the feasibility of using this data to ground
a longer-term qualitative study of HNT pro-
cesses. Synthesis of this data will help to provide
an understanding of common themes relating to
the ways in which processes and interventionsWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 3 of 13
within the HNT programme have been experi-
enced by residents and other stakeholders.
3. To define primary and secondary outcome
measures for assessment of HNT effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness using existing HNT datasets and
routinely available data. The HNT programme has
broad shared priorities, but a longer-term study of
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will require
clearly defined outcome measures and will depend
on the availability of data to operationalise these
measures.
4. To test the feasibility of including all 10 HNT
demonstrator sites in the study to improve study
power and representativeness. A holistic study of
the impacts of the HNT programme should include
all 10 HNT demonstrator sites. It is therefore
important to investigate the feasibility of including
HNT sites that are not part of the HNTEC and
may not currently be seeking to evaluate the health
impacts of developments and activities at these
sites.
5. To set up an HNT Residents ’Group and wider
Stakeholder Groups to advise the study,
incorporating their input into the baseline study
and longer-term research design. Patient and public
involvement (PPI) will form an essential part of a
potential longer-term study. It is therefore neces-
sary, as part of the proposed feasibility research, to
consolidate existing relationships with residents and
support residents to work together with other
stakeholders and the researchers to inform the re-
search from design through to dissemination.
Overview
The proposed research involves harmonising and synthe-
sising existing data from local HNT evaluations, defining
appropriate health, wellbeing and economic outcomes and
testing the feasibility of future research over a longer
period for all HNT sites. Our research design is informed
by a whole systems approach using participatory mapping
in a sample of HNT sites with stakeholders including resi-
dents [ 27]. Researchers will elicit key variables to develop
a qualitative conceptualisation of the system and its
boundaries, using a framework that understands the
programme within complex and adaptive social systems
[28]. Development of the HNT system will provide a road
map for longer-term research by identifying key change
elements to be monitored over time. An overview of all re-
search processes is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Establishing a research partnership with HNT
stakeholders
Five HNT sites (Barking Rivers ide, Bicester, Darlington,
Ebbsfleet and Whitehill & Bordon) form the HNTEvaluation Collaborative (HNTEC). Some of these sites have
conducted baseline surveys and, using varied approaches,
have conducted focus groups on resident experiences of
HNT developments, processes a nd specific interventions. In
Darlington HNT, participatory systems mapping workshops
have developed a theoretical fr amework that demonstrates
how HNTs might trigger feedback loops that influence sys-
tems operating on the sites. We will test the feasibility of
expanding the research programme from 5 to all 10 HNT
sites. We aim to develop relationships with the remaining 5
sites (Cranbrook, Whyndyke Farm, Halton Lea, Northstowe
and Barton Park), and if feasible to recruit them to partici-
pate in the research processes d escribed below and recruit
them to join a future longer-term study.
Settings and interventions
The initial setting for this baseline and feasibility study
consists of 5 of the 10 HNT sites that are part of the
HNT Evaluation Collaborative (with an aim of recruiting
additional sites, as described above). Sites encompass
not only the new housing developments but also sur-
rounding areas. The geographical sizes of HNT sites and
developments vary. Sites can be defined approximately
using Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs). Most
are made up of two MSOAs (each with a minimum
population size of 5000; mean of 7200). It will be neces-
sary, through the feasibility research described in this
protocol, to investigate how the geographical boundaries
of HNT sites can be defined accurately and consistently.
For example, if the definition of an HNT site includes
areas surrounding housing developments, there is a need
to identify how these surrounding areas can be defined
consistently with stakeholder agreement regarding the
accuracy of such definitions. Details of the new housing
developments planned at each HNT demonstrator site
are shown in Table 1. The geographic location of the
HNT sites and locations of the developments at each site
are shown in Fig. 2.
The HNT sites aim to improve population health and
reduce inequalities by embedding 10 healthy design
principles which draw upon national and international
evidence and guidelines on healthy planning and design
[10,16]. The description of the 10 healthy design princi-
ples below has been adapted from NHS England ’s‘Put-
ting Health into Place ’publication [ 20].
1.Plan ahead collectively . An authentically ‘whole
systems ’approach to creating healthier places
requires meaningful collaboration between a diverse
mix of people and organisations with a shared
vision and clear objectives. To be able to ‘plan
ahead collectively ’HNTs will need to form
partnerships with representatives from local
councils, public health, health providers, housingWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 4 of 13
developers and housing associations, community
organisations, residents and businesses.
2.Plan integrated health services that meet local needs .
An understanding of the specific local health needs
of the populations at each HNT site, and how these
needs may change, is essential for the effective
delivery of health services. HNT sites will need to
plan and forecast health and care workforce
requirements supported by the modern digital and
technological infrastructure needed to deliver and
manage health and care services.
3.Connect ,involve and empower people and
communities . Social relationships are essential for
health and wellbeing. Strong communities that
promote cohesion, inclusion and collectivedecision-making can help form a greater sense of
connection with the places where people live and
work. HNTs will need to use social and traditional
media, community events and community leaders
to create cohesive communities that make the most
of collective skills and knowledge.
4.Create compact neighbourhoods . Neighbourhoods
that are compact and well-connected tend to be
more walkable and to promote physical activity and
social interaction. HNTs will need to create neigh-
bourhoods with an accessible mix of land uses (i.e.
shops, jobs, services, home and schools), well-
connected streets, cycling infrastructure, a culture
of active travel and social interaction and a reduced
reliance on cars.

5.Maximise active travel . Physical activity is vital
for promoting better physical and mental health.
HNT sites will need to plan neighbourhoods that
help to promote active travel. Well-planned
neighbourhoods will make active travel anappealing choice for all residents by providing
appropriate infrastructure and affordable options
for active travel. These may include well-designed
and maintained walking and cycling paths with
appropriate signage and the use of digital

technology to provide information, help plan
journeys and promote use.
6.Inspire and enable healthy eating . Making it easier
and more affordable for people to follow healthier
diets is key to reducing health inequalities. HNT
sites will need to create places that facilitate access
to healthy cooking ingredients and meals in the
local area. As well as improving access to healthier
foods, limiting access to less healthy foods may be
possible through local authority planning and
licencing decisions.
7.Foster health in homes and buildings . Workplace,
school and residential buildings can have an
important impact on health through the impact
of their design on ventilation, lighting and
privacy. Public buildings can also influence
wellbeing by providing opportunities for social
interaction or quiet reflection. HNT sites will
need to use their influence on planning decisions
to create homes and buildings that use
innovative and technological solutions to create
healthy buildings.
8.Enable healthy play and leisure . The availability of
opportunities to make healthy choices about how to
use leisure time can have an important influence on
health and wellbeing. HNTs will need to provide
opportunities for people of all ages to spend their
leisure time being active, socialising and enjoying
themselves. This can include providing safe spaces
for social and physical activity suitable for all in
local parks. These opportunities can be advertised
and augmented using digital technology and social
media.
9.Provide health services that help people stay well .
The provision of support to allow people to stay
healthy and to manage long-term conditions is cen-
tral to new models of healthcare. HNT sites will
need to strengthen primary care services and work
with community organisations to provide appropri-
ate out-of-hospital care services including peer sup-
port, health coaching, social prescribing and mobile
apps to support the health and care needs of
residents.
10.Create integrated health services . Planning the
location and integration of a range of health
services to improve support, diagnosis, treatment
and care can improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of health and care systems. HNT sites
will need to enable staff and services including GPs,
acute care services and mental health services to
work together efficiently. This may include planning
services to be located at the same site and using
digital technology to help services work together
more efficiently.These broad design principles are shared across HNT
sites, but the ways in which they are interpreted, inte-
grated into development plans and applied in practice
will vary between HNT sites depending on stakeholder
perspectives and site-specific priorities. Figure 3shows
an example of how elements of these healthy design
principles have been adapted and integrated into local
HNT planning through Darlington HNT ’s Design Prin-
ciples Evidence and Practice Guide [ 19]. Some examples
of specific interventions to be tested at HNT sites in-
clude fast food-free zones near schools in Barking River-
side (design principle 6); a free, rewards-based ‘Get
Active ’smartphone app for new residents in Ebbsfleet
(design principle 5); designing safe and appealing green
spaces (design principles 3, 4, 5 and 8); building
dementia-friendly streets (design principles 3, 4 and 8);
and enhancing people's access to new GP services using
digital technology (design principles 1, 2 and 10). Fur-
ther examples and case studies are available in NHS
England ’s‘Putting Health into Place ’publication [ 20].
An important part of the feasibility research proposed
here will be to understand similarities and differences in
the way these healthy design principles are applied and
integrated into planning across the HNT sites.
Participatory systems mapping
The overall aims of the HNT programme —to improve
health, wellbeing and inequalities using a whole system
approach —are very broad in scope. The feasibility of a
longer-term study to assess whether these aims have
been achieved will require clear definitions of expected
outcomes and the processes through which these out-
comes are expected to be achieved. Participatory systems
mapping [ 27] is a method that can be used to develop a
theoretical framework to illustrate how expected changes
may occur. Participatory systems mapping [ 27] will be
used to produce a framework for understanding vari-
ation, as well as similarity, in the local and overall effects
of the programme in the different ‘systems ’in which the
HNT programme is seeking to affect change. The result-
ing systems maps will contribute to an understanding of
the processes and mechanisms through which HNT
programme activities and interventions operate.
Participants, sampling and recruitment
The research team will run participatory systems map-
ping workshops with relevant stakeholders —including
residents, decision-makers, planners, local politicians,
voluntary sector representatives and academics —in the
participating HNT sites that form the HNTEC. Partici-
pant numbers will vary per site depending on local
programme size, but are expected to be between 12 and
20 per workshop, to incorporate representatives of dif-
ferent interest groups in the HNT and surrounding areaWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 7 of 13
and to provide an appropriate balance of stakeholder
diversity.
Data collection
Qualitative data will be generated in 2-h local workshops
(one per participating HNT site) incorporating a partici-
patory systems mapping exercise. This exercise will map
the different elements within the local HNT system and
will require stakeholders to discuss their experiences and
understandings of how the HNT programme and its
processes operate and how specific outcomes may be in-
fluenced. Discussion topics will include the issues they
were seeking to address through the HNT programme,
the interventions they have implemented, their assump-
tions about how these interventions would affect change,
any unintended consequences, and interactions between
different elements in this system. In the first instance,
systems mapping data will be collected across five HNT
sites. We will generate data on the types of interventions
implemented in HNT programmes, the contexts in
which HNTs have been implemented, assumptions onhow the programme will affect change and intended and
unintended consequences. Participatory systems map-
ping methodology will be used to co-develop with the
stakeholders a visual system and causal loop diagram in
each HNT site demonstrating the different elements
within the system and the links between them. Systems
will be compared and integrated across sites (cases) to
develop hypotheses for testing the impact of HNTs over
the longer term.
Data analysis
The participatory mapping exercise will be used to pro-
duce a visual ‘system ’graphically illustrating the
expected outcome of the HNT programme and the an-
ticipated process through which outcomes will be
achieved. The visual system will illustrate the ways in
which specific interventions and actions within the HNT
programme are expected to influence specific health and
wellbeing outcomes. Researchers will use this visual sys-
tem to develop a causal loop diagram (CLD) in VENSIM
computer software. A CLD will demonstrate the
Fig. 3 Darlington Healthy New Towns design principlesWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 8 of 13
different elements within the system, the links between
them, how they are interconnected and how alterations
to these elements may affect change. We will analyse
‘factors of influence ’[24] to identify potential causal fac-
tors for particular outcomes, considering criteria for es-
tablishing the sufficiency of these factors to explain the
outcome. These CLDs will make explicit the assump-
tions expressed by participating stakeholders about the
expected outcomes of the HNT programme and the
mechanisms through which the outcomes are expected
to be influenced. The resulting CLDs for each site will
be compared in order to develop a national level ‘system ’
which will be used to identify the elements in which
the HNT is affecting change and develop hypothesised
pathways to health improvement which can be followed
longitudinally.
Scoping and synthesis of qualitative data from existing
local evaluations
Some HNT sites, including the 5 sites within the
HNTEC, have conducted formative qualitative resident
evaluations to understand experiences of HNT develop-
ments, processes and specific interventions. These evalu-
ations have used different approaches and cover a broad
range of topics and interventions. Therefore, synthesis of
data from these evaluations will help to provide an un-
derstanding of common themes relating to the ways in
which processes and interventions within the HNT
programme have been experienced by residents and
other stakeholders.
Synthesis of any available qualitative data from existing
local evaluations will be brought together with findings
from the participatory systems mapping to form the
basis for a longer-term qualitative study of the processes
and mechanisms through which the HNT programme
operates. Some sites have evaluated HNT processes
through interviews and focus groups with residents.
Where individual sites have commissioned evaluation
partners to carry out qualitative evaluations of specific
interventions (e.g. a cycle training programme for resi-
dents), we will seek to collate and assess the relevance of
these findings for the longer-term study.
Data collection
We will request access to any qualitative findings already
produced by local evaluation teams at HNT sites. Local
qualitative evaluations will be included in the synthesis if
findings are publicly available or access to reports of
findings are granted by local site leads and evaluators
and there is ethical approval for findings to be dissemi-
nated in anonymised formats. Reports will be collated
and assessed for relevance and quality, and findings ex-
tracted using a standardised table to be populated withkey information about the qualitative evaluations (e.g.
aims, participants, data collection and analysis).
Data analysis
Findings from local evaluations will be analysed to
understand common themes relating to successes and
challenges in implementing HNT principles. Existing
qualitative data from local evaluations will be synthe-
sised using thematic analysis [ 30] and fed into the local
and national level system maps described above. We will
map characteristics of participants in these evaluations
and write a commentary on their diversity, as recorded
in study documents, in terms of interest groups and pro-
tected characteristics.
Harmonisation and scoping of quantitative data
The feasibility of a longer-term study of the effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of the HNT programme will not
only require clearly defined outcome measures but also
depend on the availability of data to operationalise these
measures. We will scope the suitability of routinely avail-
able social, economic, demographic, health and environ-
ment data as (1) primary and secondary outcome
measures, (2) a way to select comparator sites, and (3)
parameters for the economic evaluation. This data may
include, for example, data held by Public Health England
(PHE) reporting on rates of chronic diseases such as car-
diovascular disease and diabetes; data held by the Office
for National Statistics on demographic characteristics,
geographic characteristics such as land use and levels of
active transport; and other anonymised data held by
Local Authorities and Primary Care including local
population health surveys, data on hospital admissions
for specific health problems and General Practice pre-
scription rates. We will also scope the availability of
existing locally held quantitative datasets including resi-
dent surveys and other local evaluations using quantita-
tive measures. If access is granted by local site leads/
evaluators, there is ethical approval for information to
be shared, and the measures can be matched across sites,
we will harmonise data across HNT sites into a single
dataset.
Data collection
A wide range of potential sources of routine data will be
identified and assessed for potential relevance by the re-
search team in collaboration with the HNT Evaluation
Collaborative. Where individual sites have commissioned
evaluation partners to carry out quantitative surveys of
health and wellbeing, health behaviours, use of local re-
sources, and awareness of local activities, we will seek to
collate these into a national level dataset. An example of
relevant data is a survey completed by a sample of 1106
Bicester HNT residents from April to June 2017. AnyWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 9 of 13
existing quantitative datasets collected as part of local
evaluations will be identified via evaluation partners and
site leads. For routine data and existing locally held
quantitative data, we will collect metadata on the
methods used to operationalise health, economic and be-
havioural measures approaches to sampling, and timing
of data collection.
Data analysis
The analysis of this data will entail assessment of the
feasibility of accessing the data required for a longer-
term study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
the HNT programme. For routinely available data we
will use metadata to assess whether the available data
are suitable for assessment of expected outcomes, avail-
able at suitable time points to retrospectively form pre-
intervention baseline measures, and likely to be available
at future intervals suitable for follow up. When primary
and secondary outcomes have been defined and vali-
dated with key stakeholders, sample size and power cal-
culations will be used to test the feasibility of using these
data to form a baseline for a longer-term study. Using
existing surveys and locally held datasets (e.g. residents ’
surveys and local quantitative evaluations), we will test
the feasibility of harmonising a quantitative baseline
dataset across HNT sites. Where feasible, we will com-
bine existing data into a single dataset, establishing
where variables are comparable across sites. We will in-
tegrate survey data with other locally held quantitative
datasets containing information on residents ’health,
wellbeing and health behaviours. We will assess all data
for quality (i.e. validity, reliability, timeliness, precision,
integrity). Metadata will be used to assess comparability
of measures across HNT sites and suitability for assess-
ment of expected outcomes, whether these samples are
representative of the HNT resident populations, and
whether the timing of data collection is consistent across
HNT sites, and therefore appropriate to form a pre-
intervention baseline.
Control/comparator group
To be able to generate robust evidence on the effective-
ness and cost-effectiveness of the HNT programme, it
will be necessary to select control areas to compare the
rate of change in outcome measures at the HNT sites
with the rate of change in areas that are not part of the
HNT programme. We will test the feasibility of using
area-level propensity score matching [ 31] to match HNT
sites to comparator sites [ 32]. The set of variables for
which routinely available data is available will be nar-
rowed through a Delphi panel composed of members of
the Evaluation Collaborative and stakeholders including
Residents ’Group members. Using methods described by
de Vocht et al. [ 32], panel members will use experientialand expert knowledge to reduce the dataset to a nar-
rower set of variables considered to be important influ-
ences on outcomes. We will assess the feasibility of
using this approach to selecting variables as well as other
appropriate approaches such as principle component
analysis.
Outcome measures
Primary and secondary outcomes will be selected based
on findings from participatory systems mapping and
availability of data from existing surveys/datasets from
HNT sites and routinely available measures. Systems
maps will guide the selection of outcomes to best match
the changes theorised in the maps. These may include
changes in health behaviour and levels of inequality, an-
ticipated through changes to resources and the built en-
vironment. Selection of primary and secondary
outcomes will also be informed by the HNT programme
priorities and through stakeholder discussion.

Health economic evaluation
The aim of the health economic analysis is to determine
if HNTs are cost-effective in the long-term. To reach
this aim we will scope existing data sources such as Hos-
pital Episodes Statistics [ 33], Health Survey for England
[34], Understanding Society Survey [ 35], English Longi-
tudinal Survey for Aging [ 36], data held by local author-
ities and PHE [ 37] to identify appropriate economic
outcomes for an economic evaluation. Part of this scop-
ing exercise will determine if appropriate data is avail-
able at key time points to be used in an economic
evaluation and if there are any gaps in the data which
can be filled by primary data collection. In a definitive
longer-term study, this data would be utilised in multi-
variate regression analysis to determine if the benefits of
HNTs outweighed the costs of the programme.
Criteria for progression to a longer-term study
We will progress to development and submission of a
full proposal for a larger study of longer-term processesWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 10 of 13
and outcomes if the following progression criteria are
met: (1) Primary and secondary outcomes for the overall
HNT programme can be defined based on the HNT
programme priorities and findings from the participatory
systems mapping. (2) A core set of these outcomes can
be measured using routinely available or locally held
data to retrospectively form a baseline, and these data
are of acceptable quality (i.e. validity, reliability, timeli-
ness, precision, integrity). (3) HNT sites can be matched
to comparator sites retrospectively using such data. (4)
Sample size and power calculations indicate that the
data will be feasible to use as a baseline against which
changes in outcomes can be measured. (5) Existing
qualitative data from local HNT evaluations together
with the findings of the participatory systems mapping
can be used to inform a longer-term qualitative study on
HNT processes and mechanisms. (6) Relationships with
key stakeholders in HNTs can be developed and main-
tained beyond the initial formative evaluation period
which ends in March 2019.
Patient and public involvement
Throughout this research, we will embed best practice
methods of public and patient involvement (PPI) and
community and stakeholder engagement, using co-
production approaches [ 38,39]. We will actively engage
and support residents from the HNT communities so
that they can work together with other stakeholders and
the researchers to inform the project at all stages, from
design through to dissemination. At the heart of the PPI
work, residents ’involvement will be facilitated and sup-
ported through establishment of an HNT Residents ’
Group (RG). Two residents will be recruited from each
of the HNT sites in the study, using maximum variation
criteria to ensure diversity and inclusion from an equal-
ities perspective. The RG will advise researchers on how
best to involve community members from each site to
ensure the research draws a wide range of residents into
co-production processes. The RG will also be involved
in the development of research and ethics materials,
press releases, report drafts and dissemination. RG
members will receive training, specific support before
each meeting or workshop and recompense for their
time dedication through vouchers following INVOLVE
guidelines: http://www.invo.org.uk/find-out-more/what-
is-public-involvement-in-research-2/ . All research activ-
ities will incorporate elements of PPI, wider stakeholder
engagement and co-production.
Project management and governance
We will set up a Stakeholder Advisory Group building
on the HNT Evaluation Collaborative (HNTEC) and
expanding to include representatives of local Directors
of Public Health, Councillors and Health and WellbeingBoards, Residents ’Group, NHSE and PHE. This group
will enable us to continue and extend the co-production
approach we have taken, through our work with the
HNTEC, in the conception, scoping and development of
this initial feasibility study. Work with this wider Stake-
holder Group will also facilitate ongoing co-production
of ambitions and plans for longer-term research into the
impact of the HNT programme, subject, of course, to
the conclusions from this initial feasibility study.
Dissemination
We will disseminate findings using appropriate formats
and print, online and social media for audiences
including local governmental organisations, planners
and developers, and local stakeholders. Findings will be
published in peer-reviewed and practitioner publications.
Presentations will be made at academic and practitioner
conferences (e.g. national and international public health
conferences). The findings will also be reported as brief-
ing papers to commissioners, managers and the public.
Discussion
The HNT programme provides a unique opportunity to
examine a cross-section of new housing developments in
England that are underpinned by healthy planning prin-
ciples. This baseline and feasibility study has the poten-
tial to provide valuable information on the systems
within which these new developments are operating, the
expected outcomes of the programme and the processes
through which outcomes may be influenced. Further-
more, this research is necessary to understand how
longer-term health, wellbeing, behavioural and economic
outcomes can be measured and monitored to generate
evidence on the effectiveness of the HNT programme in
a definitive longer-term study.
Research findings have the potential to influence local
HNT stakeholders, including residents, by reinforcing
awareness of healthy design principles and the
importance of evaluating impact of their application on
health and wellbeing. There is potential in the longer
term for findings of this study to influence healthy
planning processes, through adoption by local
authorities, planners and developers of best practice,
case studies and guidance to promote application of
healthy design principles in other new housing
developments. Developing a conceptualised system for
complex interventions such as HNTs may be useful to
guide similar programmes to build healthy urban
environments in new and existing urban areas.
Conclusions
Findings from this research will allow us to show to what
extent this approach can be effective for developing and
analysing causal pathways to health improvement throughWatts et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2020) 6:4 Page 11 of 13
complex systems where outcomes may only manifest over
longer time periods. Findings will also have potential value
for planners, developers, policy-makers, funders and scien-
tists, by contributing new outcome measures on which to
base future investigations of impact, costs and benefits of
the HNT programme. For example, we will generate an
understanding of how primary and secondary outcomes
for the overall HNT programme can be defined, and
whether these outcomes can be measured using routinely
available and locally held data and what local (non-rou-
tinely collected) data needs to be captured. We will also
develop an understanding of the feasibility of evaluating
the effectiveness of the HNT programme by matching
HNT demonstrator sites to comparator sites retrospect-
ively using routinely available and locally held data. This
research will provide an understanding of the opportun-
ities and barriers to conducting longer-term research and
how these barriers may be overcome. Finally, this research
will establish the feasibility of a definitive study to assess
the long-term health impacts of HNTs
