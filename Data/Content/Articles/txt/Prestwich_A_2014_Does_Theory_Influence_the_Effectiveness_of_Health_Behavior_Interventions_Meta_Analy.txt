  Theory and Interventions  
 2 Abstract  
Objective :  To systematically investigate  the extent and type of theory use in physical acti vity 
and dietary interventions, as well as associations between extent and type of theory use with 
intervention effectiveness . 
Methods :  An in-depth analysis of studies included in two systematic  review s of physical activity 
and healthy eating interventions ( k = 190) .  Extent and t ype of theory  use was  assessed using  the 
Theory Coding Scheme (TCS)  and intervention effectiveness was calculated using Hedges’s g.  
Meta-regressions assessed the relationships between these measures .  
Results :  Fifty -six percent of interventions reported a theory  base.  Of these, 90% did not report 
links between  all of their behavior change techniques ( BCTs ) with specific theoretical constructs  
and 91%  did not  report links between  all the specified constructs with BCTs .  The associations 
between a composite score or specific items on the TCS  and intervention effectiveness were 
inconsistent.  Interventions based on S ocial Cognitive Theory  or the Transtheoretical Model  
were similarly effective and no more effecti ve than interventions not reporting a theory  base.   
Conclusions :  The coding of theory in these studies  suggested that theory was not often used 
extensively in the development of interventions .  Moreover, the relationships between type of 
theory used and the extent of theory use with effectiveness were generally weak.  The findings 
suggest that attempts to  apply the two theories  commonly used in this review more extensively   
are unlikely to increase interv ention effectiveness.

  Theory and Interventions  
 3 Applying theory to the design  and evaluation  of complex behavior change interventions 
is viewed as good practice (Glanz & Rimer, 1995; MRC, 2008).  Although there is some 
evidence for a n increasing  trend of interventions to refer to a theor etical  basis  (Noar, Palmgreen, 
Chabot, Dobransky, & Zimmerman, 2009) , a substantial proportion of studies do not , as noted in 
a variety of reviews and commentaries  (e.g., Albarracin et al., 2005; Davies, Walker, & 
Grimshaw, 2010; Hardeman, Johnston, Johnston, Bonetti, Wareham, & Kinmonth, 2002; 
Molloy, 2010).  These reviews and commentaries have not include d a detailed examination of  
how theory has been used in the d evelopment and evaluation of interventions.    
The association s between using theory as a basis for intervention  design  and intervention 
effectiveness are not well understood.  Some evidence  suggest s that reporting  the use  of theory  
to inform the development of behavior change interventions is associated with larger 
intervention effects (Albada, Auseums, Bensing, & van Dulsem, 2009; Ammerman, Lindquist, 
Lohr, & Hersey, 2002; Fisher & Fisher, 2000; Glanz & Bishop, 2010; Kim et al., 199 7; Swann et 
al., 2003; Taylor, Conner, & Lawton, 2012; Webb, Joseph, Yardley, & Michie, 2010 ).  
However, other reviews have detected  small  or no  association between reported theory use in 
intervention design and intervention effectiveness  (e.g., Albarracin  et al., 2005; Roe et al., 1997;  
Stephenson et al., 2000) while one review indicated interventions reported to be based on  theory 
were less effective compared to  those not  reporting a theory basis (Gardner et al., 2011).  Th ese 
inconsistencies in the liter ature between theory application and intervention effects require  an in -
depth examination of how theory  has been used and whether using theory in different ways is 
associated with larger behavior change effects.  
One possible reason for inconsistenc ies in the association s between theory use and 
intervention effectiveness is that earlier reviews report theory use  in simple categorical terms 
(yes/no)  (e.g., Ammerman et al., 2002).  More in-depth  assessment s of how theory has been 
applied may lead to diffe rent and/or more consistent findings.  Recent methodological 
  Theory and Interventions  
 4 developments enable such an approach.  One approach to specifying theory use in health 
behavior research is a general coding frame of four items: informed by theory; applied theory; 
tested theory ; built theory (Painter, Borba, Hynes, Mays, & Glanz, 2008).  A more detailed  
method of specifying reported  theory use is the 19 -item Theory Coding Scheme (TCS, Michie & 
Prestwich, 2010).  Th e TCS  specifies whether theory is mentioned , how theory  is direct ly used 
in intervention design , how theory influence d interventions indirectly  via the selection of 
participants and via delivery to different groups of participants, how theory explains intervention 
effects on outcomes and the implications of the results for future theory development.    
Theory can be used to inform interventions by highlighting the constructs or types of 
individuals that should be targeted by the intervention (Michie & Prestwich, 2010) or to inform 
the selection and s equence of interventio n strategies (Wingood & DiClemente, 1996).  
Consequently, t here are at least three  major  pathways through which basing an intervention on a 
specific theory  can influence intervention effectiveness : via the selection of specific behavior 
change techniques  (BCTs)  or a combination of these techniques which prove effective or 
ineffective ; influencing the inclusion of participants into the study who are likely to benefit from 
the intervention (and the exclusion of participants unlikely to benefit)  and the tailor ing of BCTs 
to individuals  (tailoring)  based on their theory -relevant characteristics .  These pathw ays are not 
necessarily related;  for example, researchers could use theory to decide which participants are 
eligible for their study but not use theory to se lect the  intervention  behavior change techniques 
or to tailor the intervention.  As a consequence, interventions that apply theory more extensively 
to address each of these pathways could be more effective than studies that apply theory less 
extensively.    
An important consideration when examining whether interventions using theory are more 
effective than those that do not is to assess how theory has been applied in the comparison 
condition (see Michie, Prestwich, & De Bruijn, 2010; Williams, 2010) .  For ex ample, studies 
  Theory and Interventions  
 5 that use  theory to tailor an intervention to both intervention and comparison conditions need to 
be differentiated from studies that use theory to tailor an intervention only to the intervention 
condition.  This is necessary as the intervention effect relates to t he difference  between the 
intervention and control groups.  Reviews of the impact of theory use on intervention 
effectiveness, therefore, need to consider whether theory has been used to develop the 
intervention in both the intervention and comparison cond itions.  
Aims  
The current review had t wo aims :  First, to use the TCS to assess the extent to which 
studies have report ed using theory to develop interventions  (Aim 1) .  Second, to investigate  
whether differential theory use was  associated with intervention  effectiveness (Aim 2).  In 
relation to this second aim, we investigated how much  specific types of theory use (measured 
through individual items on the TCS), as well as the extent  of theory use (measured through  
composite score s of multiple items on the TCS) were associated with intervention effectiveness.   
These key analyses were re -run within five sets of sensitivity analyses.  First, g iven 
intervention  effects reflect the difference  between the intervention  and comparison groups we 
coded theory use in both conditions.  Consequently, within sensitivity analyses, we tested 
whether the associations between theory use in the intervention  group and intervention 
effectiveness changed when statistically controlling for theory use in the comparison condition .  
Second, we took into account the type of control (i.e., any active control vs. waitlist, no or 
minimal intervention ).  Third , because just over a third of studies were conducted using 
participants with, or at risk of, chronic disease s, we included this factor in the analyses .  Fourth, 
due to concerns that studies that use theory to develop their interventions may be 
methodologically more rigorous, we coded risk of bias and  statistically controlled for this in an 
additional set of anal yses.  Finally, we identified and removed statistical outliers from the 
analyses.  
  Theory and Interventions  
 6 Method  
Studies  
 Studies included in the current review were based on two recent systematic reviews , 
including a review of the association between BCTs and physical activity and diet (Michie, 
Abraham, Whittington, McAteer , & Gupta , 2009) and a review investigating BCTs with in obese 
adults with, or at risk of, obesity -related co -morbiditie s (Dombrowski , Sniehotta, A venell, 
MacLennon , & Arau jo-Soares , 2012 ).  The review covered both physical activity and healthy 
eating because a number of studies targeted both of these behaviors and in order to maximize the 
scope of the review and the power of the analyses.   The datas et for the review included  140 
separate studies comprising 190 comparisons  of interventions .   
Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria  
In the Michie et al. (2009) review, the inclusion criteria were: 1. Adults aged 18 or over; 
2. Interventions targeting physical activity and/or healthy eating; 3. Use  of experimental or 
quasi -experimental designs; 4. Incorporate d objective, standardized, or validated outcome 
measures; and 5. Use of cognitive or behavioral change strategies beyond simple provision of 
information.  Their review excluded  interventions sampling specific populations (i.e. , pregnant 
women or recently postnatal women , athletes , individuals already engaged within another health 
program s, individuals not living in the free -population , individuals with physic al or mental 
health problems ).  In the Dombrowski et al. (2012 ) review, the inclusion criteria were: 1. Adults  
with a mean/median age above 40, mean/median BMI above 30, and at least one other risk factor 
for morbidity or an already present co -morbidity; 2 . Behavioral interventions targeting physical 
activity and/or healthy eating; 3. Randomized controlled trials with follow -up data at 12 weeks 
or later; 4. Report ed behavior change data for diet and physical activity by self -report or 
objective measures at baseline and follow -up.  All studies  included in this analysis, therefore,  
were evaluations of behavioral interventions aimed at increasing physical activity  and/or healthy 
  Theory and Interventions  
 7 eating, and reported measures of these behaviors and  statistical information upon which effect 
sizes could be calculated.   
Data Extraction  
The following information was extracted from each study: (a) bibliographic information  
(author, year of publication , associated papers) , (b) behavioral outcomes  (physica l activity  and/or  
healthy eating), (c) duration of intervention period, (d) intervention /control group  information 
(BCTs  used, theoretical basis, duration of intervention , use of multiple sessions, source of 
delivery, format of delivery , type of control gr oup), (e) risk of bias  (f) data required for effect 
size calculations . 
Theory use .  The Theory Coding Scheme ( TCS; Michie & Prestwich, 2010 ) was used to 
code reported theory use for the development and evaluation of interventions1.  Each of the 19 
items within th e TCS requires yes/no responses and has shown good inter-rater reliability .  The 
specific  theory  (e.g., SCT, TTM) upon which the intervention was reported to be based  was also 
coded (item 5) . 
While items on the  TCS were  treated individually in some of the analyses, some of the 
TCS items were also combined to reflect the extent of theory use  (see Table 1 for TCS items) .  
Specifically we  created three composite measures reflecting:  
- (a) the extent to which each BCT reported  by the authors was linked to a theory -relevant 
construct [BCTs → theory -relevant constructs].  As there are three items on the TCS that 
relate to this aspect of theory use (items 7 -9), the composite score was determined using 
these three items.  Of these items, studies coded ‘yes’ for item 7 (‘ All intervention 
techniques are explicitly linked to at least one theory -relevant construct ’) reflects the 
most optimal use of theory thus was weighted as +2 in the composite measure.  Studies 
coded ‘yes’ for either item 8 (‘ At least one , but not all, of the intervention techniques are 
explicitly linked to at least one theory -relevant construct ’) and/or item 9 (‘ Group of 
  Theory and Interventions  
 8 techniques are linked to a group of constructs’ ) were weighted as +1 to reflect some (but 
not exte nsive ) use of theory .  Studies coded ‘no’ to items 7, 8 and 9 were weighted 0 to 
reflect no theory use.  Thus, the ‘BCTs → theory -relevant constructs’ measure ranged 
from 0 (no theory use) to +2 (optimal theory use).  
- (b) the extent to which the constructs within the underlying theory were specifically 
targeted by the BCTs [theory -relevant constructs → BCTs].  As there are three items on 
the TCS that relate to this aspect of theory use (items 9 -11), the composite score was 
determined using these three items.   Of these items, studies coded ‘yes’ for item 10 (‘ All 
theory -relevant constructs  are explicitly linked to at least one intervention technique ’) 
reflects the most optimal use of theory thus was weighted as +2 in the composite 
measure.  Studies coded ‘yes’  for either item 11 (‘ At least one , but not all, of the  theory 
relevant constructs are explicitly linked to at least one intervention technique ’) and/or 
item 9 (‘ Group of techniques are linked to a group of constructs’ ) were weighted as +1 
to reflect some  (but not extensive ) use of theory .  Studies coded ‘no’ to items 9, 10 and 
11 were weighted 0 to reflect no theory use.  Thus, the ‘theory -relevant constructs → 
BCTs’ measure also ranged from 0 (no theory use) to +2 (optimal theory use).  
- (c) an ‘overall th eory score’ was also generated based on all of the TCS items that relate 
to using theory to develop the intervention (items 3 -11).  Studies received a +1 weight 
for each of the following: the intervention was based on a single theory (item 3); theory 
was u sed to select recipients for the intervention (item 4); the intervention was explicitly 
based on a specific theory or combination of theories (item 5); theory was used to tailor 
intervention techniques to recipients (item 6).  The sum of these items were a dded to the 
‘BCTs → theory -relevant constructs’ (see (a) above) and ‘theory -relevant constructs → 
BCTs’ (see (b) above) composite scores , creating a scale from 0 (no theory use ) to +8 
(most extensive theory use).2  Because TCS items 3, 4, and 6 may be depe ndent on the 
  Theory and Interventions  
 9 type of theory application, a s ensitivity analysis  was used to test the impact of removing 
these from the overall composite score , providing an alternative overall theory score . 
 
The TCS, where approp riate, was applied  separately  both to the  intervention and 
comparison conditions  to take into account the use of theory in the study (see ‘Data Analysis’ 
and ‘ Online supplement  table’).  This allowed the examination of whether theory use in the 
intervention  condition was associated with intervention effectiveness when controlling for theory 
use in the comparison condition  (see Michie  et al. , 2010; Williams, 2010 ). 
For the TCS, pairs of coders independently coded the theory items from 42 studies.  A 
Cohen’s k appa value between .61 and .80 reflects substantial agreement while a kappa value 
above .80 reflects almost perfect agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977).  On this basis, the levels of 
agreement were typically almost perfect (mean kappa=.88; median kappa=.89) an d at least 
substantial (>.71) for all theory items.  
Risk of bias . Based on t he Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins, 
Altman, Gøtzsche, Jüni, Moher, Oxman, et al., 2011) , an assessment was made  using the following 
items  coded y es/no: (i) does the study report randomization?; (ii) was the allocation sequence 
concealed?; (iii) was there any blinding?; (iv) was incomplete data adequately addressed?; (v)  Are 
reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting ?; (vi) is the study free from any 
other bias?3 
Data Analysis  
To assess the extent to which studies have used theory to develop and evaluate  
interventions, the percentage of studies that were coded ‘yes’ for each item on the TCS4 was 
calculated (see Table 1).   Calculat ions were  performed for both percentage s of all studies and 
studies that explicitly stated a theory  base. 
  Theory and Interventions  
 10 To examine whether items from the TCS predicted intervention  effects, a series of meta -
regressions (using a random -effects model with restri cted maximum likelihood estimation , 
computed with the meta -reg command in Stata version 12.1, Stata Corp 2011 ) were conducted.   
In our analys es, the regression coefficients are the estimated increase in the effect size per unit 
increase in the covariate(s).  To assess the p roportion of between -study variance explained  by 
each covariate, the adjusted R2value is reported.  Secondary  meta -regression analyses were 
conducted to control  for potential moderating factors .  This was done by adding the foll owing 
factors to  the meta -regression models : theory use in each control group  (i.e., as assessed with the 
TCS) , type of  control group ( i.e., any active  control vs. waitlist, no or minimal intervention ), 
disease chronicity (i.e., chronic or at risk vs. non-chronic) and factors associated with the risk of 
bias (i.e. , randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, missing outcome data, selective 
outcome reporting, and any other problems).  Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the 
impact of remo ving outlying effect sizes  (determined using the Sample -Adjusted Meta -Analytic 
Deviancy Statistic; Huffcut & Arthur, 1995) .  Sensitivity analyses are reported as supplementary 
online material (see online supplement table).  Intervention  effect size calcula tions followed the 
approach used in the original individual reviews, indexing effects as Hedges’s g (the difference 
between two means divided by their pooled standard deviation , with correction for small sample 
size) (Hedges & Olkin, 1985).   
Results  
Studies Included in the Review  
The studies included in this review were published between 1990 and 2008.  Across the 
190 comparisons , the interventions were typically delivered by non-healthcare professionals 
(46.8% ), directly to individuals  (51.1% ), withi n community -based settings (54.2% ) over a mean 
period of 8 months .   The mean final follow -up was taken at 10 -months.  Many of the outcomes  
  Theory and Interventions  
 11 were self -reported  but most of the studies (65.3%) used behavioral measures that had been 
previously validated .  The  total number of participants across the studies was 61,649.  
Risk of Bias 
 In regard to risk of bias , the vast majority clear ly reported that they randomized 
participants to condition (94.2% ).  However, few clearly reported that the allocation sequence  
was concealed  (15.8%) or that any form of blinding  was used  (25.3%).  Across the 190 
comparisons , few reported an adequate method to blind their participants (1.6%), the intervener 
(1.1%), or outcome assessors  (10.0%).  Incomplete data was judged to be adequately addressed 
in most comparisons  (56.8%).  The comparisons  were typically judged to be free from selective 
reporting (96.3%)  and free from other problems that could put them at high risk of bias ( 73.2%).  
Findings  
Table 1 outlines  the 19 items within the TCS.  These numbered items are subsequentl y 
refer enced  while addressing the study aims below.  
Aim 1: The extent to which studies reported using theory to develop and evaluate 
their interventions .   
Table 1  illustrates how theory was used  across all 190  comparisons  of interventions .  Out 
of 190 interventions , 107 (56.3%) explicitly reported that they were  based on theory (i.e. , coded 
yes to item 5).  Of the 107 interventions  reporting a theory base , 51 (47.7% ) were reported to be 
based on a single theory (item 3), 8 (7.5% ) reported using theory to recruit study participants 
(item 4) and 42 (39.3% ) reported using theory to tailor BCTs to recipients  (item 6) .  Of the se 
same 107 interventions , 11 (10.3%) reported explicit link s between  all BCTs  within the 
intervention  and the targeted theoretical construct s (item 7) while  10 (9.3%) interventions  
reported target ing all the constructs within a specified  theory  with specific BCTs  (item 10).  
Fifty -two (48.6%)  tests of interventions reported measur ing theoretical constructs post -
intervention  and 45 (42%) measured constructs both pre- and post -intervention .  However, only 
  Theory and Interventions  
 12 4 (3.7% ) tests of interventions reported statistically significant mediated effects (item 16d).  A 
similarly small number  (3, 2.8%) reported  suggestions for theoretical refinement on the basis of 
their findings  (item 19) . 
Insert Table 1 about here  
Aim 2: Is reported theory use associated with intervention effectiveness?   
The relationship betwee n reported  specific  theory use and  intervention effectiveness  is reported  
in Table 2  (see also the Supplement Table) .   
Insert Table 2 about here  
Interventions  reporting to be based on a single theory were associated with larger  effects  
(g = .33)  compared to those reporting multiple theories or a combination of theory and additional 
theory -based predictors  for intervention development (g = .23)  (see model 2) .  Of the TCS items, 
using theory to determine which participants should be recruited into the study yielded the most 
positive increase in effectiveness  (g = .51 vs. .29; see model 3) , although this variable did not 
explain any of the between -study variance .  Studies  that reported using  theory to tailor the 
intervention yielded smaller intervention  effect s than those that did not report  this tailoring  (g = 
.21 vs. .33; see model 5) .  
Interventions  referring to a theory base were no t more effective than those not explicitly 
referring to a theory base (see model 4).  Interventions  reporting links between BCTs and theory -
relevant constructs  were not more effective than others  (see models 6 to 10).  Interventions 
reported to be based on TTM or SCT were no t different in terms of effectiveness, nor were they 
more effective than those interventions that were no t reported to be based on these theories  (see 
model 11 ). 
With regard to the extent of theory use  (see Table 3, model 12) , there was little evidence 
that the following were associated in any meaningful way with intervention effectiveness: extent 
to which each BCT was linked to a theoretical construct (‘BCTs → theory -relevant constructs’ ; 
  Theory and Interventions  
 13 adjusted R2= 1.1 9%); the extent to which the constructs within the underlying theory were 
specifically targeted by the BCTs (‘theory -relevant constructs → BCTs’ ; adjusted R2= 0.48%) ; 
the ‘overall theory score’ (adjusted R2= 1.21%).   It should be noted that the seven studies that 
scored most highly on the overall theory score produced, on average, a larger effect size than the 
83 studies that scored the lowest score.  Howeve r, when all studies were taken into account, 
there was no evidence that this represents a real effect.  The same results  were found in the subset 
of studies reporting theory use (model 13), using SCT (model 14), and using TTM (model 15).  
Sensitivity analyse s suggested that the se results were relatively stable with respect to 
outliers  (studies judged to be outliers were excluded from the analyses) .  In addition , the results 
were similar when controlling for disease chronicity  and use of theory in the control group  and 
type of control group ( these were included as a factors in the meta -regression analyses ) (see 
online supplement  table ).  In addition, when variables relating to the risk of bias  were entered 
individually into a meta -regression model , randomization appeared to be the most important 
factor associated with intervention effectiveness (i .e., studies reporting to use randomization 
produced, on average, larger effects than non -randomized studies).5  Therefore , all models were 
re-run controlli ng for randomization  (see online supplement  table)  and yielded similar effects . A 
sensitivity analysis u sing the alternative overall theory score produced similar results ( B = -.02, 
adjusted R2= 1.46%).   
Discussion  
This review has systematically investigated the extent and type of theory use in 
interventions to increase physical activity and healthy eating, as well as associations between 
theory use and intervention effect iveness .  About half of the  interventions reviewed were 
reported to be explicit ly based on theory .  Of these, theory was rarely used extensively  to 
develop or evaluate the intervention  as defined by the TCS : few targe ted all theoretical 
constructs, linked all BCTs  to theoretical constructs, used theory to select recipients of their 
  Theory and Interventions  
 14 intervention, used theory to tailor their intervention , used theory as an explicit basis for their 
intervention or based their intervention on a single theory .  This limits the possibili ty of evidence 
accumulation and of studies  to experimentally evaluate  specific theories and therefore  to refine 
them on the basis of evidence.   
The majority of the analyses revealed no association between theory use (assessed 
through individual TCS items o r combinations of TCS items) and intervention effectiveness.  
Where there were significant associations these tended to be weak ; thus, inferences made from 
these findings should be considered cautiously.  The finding that interventions that report using 
theory to select recipients yielded the largest intervention effects  (albeit still small)  is consistent 
with results of a recent review examining  internet -based interventions (Webb et al., 2010 ).  
However, this may be due to the selecti on of participants most likely to respond  to intervention s 
(e.g., because they are more motivated to change ).  Basing an intervention on multiple theories 
appeared to be  somewhat  less effective than basing i t on a single theory .  Basing an intervention 
on two theories provid ing contradictory accounts of how behavior changes may explain this  
(Dombrowski, Sniehotta, Avenell, & Coyne, 2007) .  A multi -theory approach  without a clear 
rationale , described by Bandura (1998 ) as “cafeteria style research” (p. 628 ), may  also fail to 
capitalize on the potentially beneficial impact that a coherent theory base may offer .  We 
attempted to enhance the confidence in our findings by co -varying a number of potential 
moderators in our analyses. Given the possibility that studies that m ake greater use of theory to 
design their intervention would adopt more stringent methodological controls, these moderators 
included the type of control group (active control vs. delayed or no intervention control) and risk 
of bias.  The results appeared g enerally robust within these sensitivity analyses and also in 
relation to similar analyses taking into account the use of theory in the control group (see 
Williams, 2010; Michie et al., 2010), outliers and disease chronicity within the target population.   
As a consequence, the findings of this review are not in line with the findings from some earlier 
  Theory and Interventions  
 15 reviews that argued  that basing interventions on theory should increase effectiveness (e.g., 
Albada et al., 2009; Fisher & Fisher, 2000; Glanz & Bishop, 2010;  Kim et al., 1997; Swann et 
al., 2003) , although these reviews typically assessed a wider range of theories and did not use a 
quantitative measure such as the Theory Coding Scheme .  Specifically, our findings may suggest 
that applying the two theories comm only used in this review  more extensively  is unlikely to 
increase intervention effectiveness.   However, we note particular caveats.    
It should be noted  that our findings apply to the extent of theory use as measured by the 
TCS and for the two theories with sufficient data to analyse , SCT and TTM .  Second, the overall 
theory score was based on the summation of all relevant items.  Particular combinations of 
items, reflecting certain elements of theory use, may increase intervention effects.  Third, 
cauti on should be taken in generalising the results on the basis of a null finding (i.e., no 
association between the extent of theory use and intervention effectiveness).  Fourth, we were 
only able to investigate theory use as reported in published articles, an d this is likely to 
underestimate actual practice (Lorencatto, Michie, West & Stavri, 2011).  Ideally, full study and 
intervention protocols would be publicly available  to supplement this information, as they  are 
often difficult to obtain  from authors .  Some journals now make this a requirement for 
publication (e.g. Addiction, Implementation Science) and wider adoption of this practice would 
be of great help to advancing our science.   Fifth, p revious research has s uggested considerable 
discrepancies between  protocol and delivery in practice (e.g., Borrelli, 2011; Hardeman et al., 
2008), which has implications for any investigation of associations between theoretical 
underpinning and intervention content and effect s (Michie et al., 2008) .  Fidelity thus  needs  to be 
taken into account when considering our own and other researchers’ findings in this area.  A 
precise estimate of the relationship between theory use and  intervention  effectiveness can only 
be obtained from studies with high fidelity of delivery .  Sixth, a more comprehensive search 
strategy may have identified a greater number of  eligible studies.  This is a common problem

 16 with any review.  However, we have synthesized evidence f rom two substantial reviews leading 
to the inclusion of 140 studies.  A s a consequence,  the results should be reasonably robust 
against the omission of studies not identified through our search strategy.   
This review demonstrates an  in-depth  analytic method for investigating how theories are 
used and how they relate to intervention effectiveness .  Using  this method, we have found that 
theories  (particularly SCT and TTM)  are not typically used as extensively as they could be in the 
development of interventions  and that applying  SCT and TTM  more extensively may not 
increase effectiveness .  However, d eveloping more explicit links between type of theory, 
possible  mediating pathways (including the selection of recipients; tailoring; mechanisms of 
behavior change techniques ) and outc omes  would represent an important step in advancing our 
understanding of behavior change and intervention  effects.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Theory and Interventions  
 17 Footnotes  
1 Item 3 on the TCS (‘Intervention was based on a single theory’) was considered in 
particular depth by comparing interventions based on a single theory, interventions based on 
multiple theories (or a combination of theory and predictors - constructs falling  outside of the 
stated theory) and interventions based only on predictors against no theoretical base (no theory 
and no predictors).  
2The other items do not refer to using theory to develop their intervention  thus were not 
included in the  composite measure s reflecting extent of theory use .  
3A sub -set of studies (14/140) was independently double -coded by two reviewers.  For 
one of the items (‘Was the allocation sequence concealed?’), there was more than one 
disagreement acr oss the two coders.  To enhance re liability , the codes for this item were double -
checked  prior to analysis.   
4The analyses reported, unless specified, excluded the concept of ‘predictors’ (see Michie 
& Prestwich, 2010). ‘Predictors’, in the TCS, refer to constructs, falling outside of a t heory, that 
are identified as correlates of behavior and targeted for intervention.  Where authors note their 
intervention is based on a specific theory plus predictors (e.g., Theory of Planned Behavior plus 
social support) or only predictors (e.g., social  support), the predictors were ignored to more 
clearly assess the impact of theory alone.  
5Although we anticipated that the studies that made more extensive use of theory in the 
development of their intervention would also be the most methodologically rigorous, we 
detected only weak relationships between the measures assessing the extent of theo ry use and 
measures tapping the risk of bias (all Spearman’s rho values ranged between -.21 and .08).

 Results used to refine 
theory  The authors attempt to refine the theory upon which the 
intervention was based by either: a) adding or removing 
constructs to the theory, or b) specifying that the 
interrelationships between the theoretical constructs should 
be changed and spelling out which relationships should be 
changed  1.6 2.8
