Abstract
Background: Depression is a common health problem during adolesce nce and is associated with adverse academic, social
and health outcomes. To meet the demand for treatment for adolescent depression, there is a need for evidence-based
interventions suitable for deli very outside of specialist Child and Adolescent M ental Health Services (CAMHS). Interpersonal
Counselling for Adolescents (IPC-A) is a brief manualised intervention for adolescent depression suitable for delivery by staff
who are not qualified health professionals following participation in a brief training course. While initial piloting within Local
Authority services has generated promi sing results, the effectiveness and co st-effectiveness of IPC-A has yet to be
established. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a random ised controlled trial (RCT), eval uating the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of IPC-A delivered by staff without core professional training in comparison to current provision.
Method: Feasibility RCT with process evaluation using ethnographic methodology. Eligible young people ( n=6 0 )w i l lb e
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IPC-A or treatment as usual (TAU). Participants will be assessed pre-randomisation
(baseline) and followed up at 5, 10 and 23 weeks post-randomisation. A parallel process evaluation will generate
understanding of intervention implementation across services and explore the acceptability of the intervention from the
perspective of young people and other key stakeholders.
Participants: Y o u n gp e o p l ea g e d1 2 –18 years presenting to non-specialist ser vices with symptoms of depression. Youth
workers, young people and stakeholders will participate in the process evaluation.

Discussion: The need for effective and accessible interventions for young people with mild/sub-threshold depression who,
in most cases, do not meet the threshold for mainstream mental health services is long overdue. The primary output of this
feasibility trial will be the design of the subsequent full-scale trial. If the results of the current study indicate that this would
be feasible, we intend to progress to a multi-site, assessor-blind, s uperiority RCT of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
I P C - Ai nc o m p a r i s o nt oT A Uf o ra d o l e s c e n t sp r e s e n t i n gt on o n - s p ecialist services with depressi ve symptoms. If satisfactory
solutions to any problems encountered cannot be identified, alternative research designs will be considered. If proven
effective, an IPC-A training programme could be implemented.

Background
Depression is a common health problem during adoles-
cence. Adolescent lifetime prevalence of major depressive
disorder (MDD) is 11 –20% [ 1,2]. However, mild/sub-
threshold depression is much more common in adoles-
cents than full MDD [ 3] (People with mild/sub-threshold
depression show some clinical symptoms of MDD but
number of symptoms is just below or only just above the
diagnostic threshold.) Such mild depression is associated
with significant personal and public health consequences
[4] and is a strong predictor for future onset of full [ 5].
Sub-threshold depression has a lifetime prevalence rate of
26% [ 6] and about 30% of affective disorders that occur in
adulthood start in adolescence [ 7]. Depression in adoles-
cence predicts a range of adverse outcomes in adulthood,
including ongoing mental health problems [ 8], poorer
physical health [ 9], and social, legal and financial problems
[10], and is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in
young people who die by suicide [ 11]. The total annual
cost of depression in England has been estimated to be at
least £20.2 billion [ 12]. However, there is evidence that
early and timely psychological intervention can prevent re-
lapse and recurrence [ 13], and therefore, intervening early,
before depression symptoms become severe, could gener-
ate substantial savings.
In the UK, the majority of mental health services for
young people are commissioned through a tiered system;
tier 1 represents early intervention and prevention ser-
vices, provided by schools, school nurses and General
Practitioners; tier 2 involves early help and targeted ser-
vices and may be provided by young people ’s teams,
youth support services, family support teams, education
support centres and education psychologists; tier 3 con-
sists of specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health
Services (CAMHS); and tier 4 is inpatient mental health
services. Most adolescents seeking treatment for depres-
sion have mild disorder [ 14]. In the UK, such cases of
mild depression are not likely to meet treatment thresh-
olds for specialist tier 3 services. Instead, young people
with mild depression are seen by staff working in localauthority child and family services or tier 2 NHS-funded
mental health services often delivered by third-sector or
voluntary agencies. Most of those working with de-
pressed young people within these non-specialist ser-
vices do not have core mental health professional
training, e.g. psychiatrist, psychologist, registered mental
health nurse and psychological therapist (e.g. CBT ther-
apist, family therapist) and have no formal training in
delivering evidence-based treatments for people with
depression.
Current guidelines for the treatment of mild depres-
sion in children and young people [ 15] recommend sim-
ple non-specific psychosocial strategies, such as non-
directive supportive therapy (which mainly involves ac-
tive listening rather than developing specific strategies to
improve symptoms). A recent large network meta-
analysis has shown that while non-directive supportive
therapy is better than a waiting list (i.e. no treatment)
for adolescent depression, it is not significantly better
than psychological placebo [ 16]. It is important to note
that the primary studies included in this meta-analysis
took place in a range of services for a range of severities
of depression. No randomised controlled trials have
taken place in the tier 1/2 services described above,
where most cases of mild depression are treated in the
UK. Thus, there is a clear lack of evidence as to how to
treat young people in these services [ 17–19].
Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a NICE-
recommended first-line treatment for adolescents with mod-
erate to severe depression. IPT helps patients to understand
the two-way links between their depressive symptoms and
current interpersonal relation ships. It also helps patients to
improve their interpersonal relationships. In doing so, it aims
to reduce depressive symptoms. Whereas non-directive sup-
portive therapy aims ‘to help patients accommodate to exist-
ing reality rather than try to help them change it ’[20], IPT
focuses on helping patients to take active steps to improve
their relationships in orde r to decrease their depressive
symptoms. Theoretical influences on IPT include Adolf
Meyer ’s‘psychobiological ’approach, which emphasizedAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 2 of 14
patients ’current interpersonal and psychosocial experiences
[21] and Harry Stack Sullivan ’s‘interpersonal ’approach,
which conceptualised psychiatry as the scientific study of
people and interpersonal processes [ 22].
Meta-analyses have demonstrated IPT to be superior
to control treatments for depression in both adults [ 23]
and adolescents [ 16] and to lead to similar outcomes as
cognitive-behaviour therapy in both age groups. Cru-
cially, IPT has been shown to be significantly more ef-
fective than supportive counselling for depressed
adolescents [ 24]. Given the importance of interpersonal
relationship difficulties in the causation of adolescent de-
pression [ 17], and the developmental priority given to
interpersonal relationships during adolescence, this ap-
proach has high face validity for this age group.
However, in common with other evidence-based treat-
ments for adolescent depression, IPT must be delivered
by those with core mental health professional training.
As such, it is unlikely to be a feasible treatment option
outside of specialist CAMHS in the UK. Interpersonal
counselling (IPC) is an adaptation of IPT with three
main differences: the treatment duration is shorter (3 –6
sessions), it is designed for clients with mild depression,
and it can be delivered by non-mental health profes-
sionals after participation in a brief (2-day) training
course. If found to be an effective treatment, training
existing workers in non-specialist young persons services
as IPC therapists could facilitate a rapid and relatively
low-cost expansion of the therapy workforce in line with
NHS England and government policy.
IPC has been found to be an effective treatment for
adults with mild to moderate depression. A pilot study
[25] which compared IPC and IPT concluded that IPC
was equally an effective intervention for treating mild to
moderate depression in primary care setting. In a rando-
mised control trial conducted in primary care [ 26], IPC
was compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tor (SSRI) amongst patients with major depression, and
it was found that IPC achieved significantly higher rates
of remission in adults with mild depression. An adapted
form of IPC designed to meet the needs of young people
(IPC-A) has recently been developed and piloted by
members of the research team of this study (PW and
VC): six local authority family support workers in the
UK were trained in IPC-A [ 27]. Evaluation of the single-
arm pilot demonstrated that young people undergoing
IPC-A experienced an improvement in depressive symp-
toms and that the therapy was acceptable to young
people and therapists. However, it is unknown whether
IPC-A is more effective than the current treatment as
usual (TAU) for young people presenting with depres-
sive symptoms in these services. A randomised con-
trolled trial of IPC-A vs TAU is needed to answer this
question, minimising bias and confounding. However,large-scale RCTs have not been conducted in this staff/
participant population, and so, it is unsure whether such
an RCT would be practical. Hence, a feasibility RCT is
needed first.
This study is intended to provide the information
needed to progress to a full-scale randomised controlled
trial of IPC-A delivered by staff without core profes-
sional training (referred to in this paper as ‘youth mental
health workers ’).
Aims and objectives
The ICALM study will inform a future trial of the effect-
iveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention (IPC-
A). The aim of the proposed research is to answer the
following feasibility questions which arise from the vari-
ability in service models across providers of non-
specialist mental health support for young people:
1. Are trial procedures, including recruitment (of
participants and therapists), randomisation,
research assessments and follow-up, feasible and ac-
ceptable to support the conduct of a future RCT?
2. How are IPC-A and current treatment as usual
(TAU) delivered and how and why does interven-
tion delivery vary across differing service contexts?
3. To what extent does contamination of the control
arm occur and should it be mitigated against in a
future trial?
4. Does the interval estimate of benefit of IPC-A over
TAU in depression scores at post-treatment include
a clinically significant effect?
Methods
Design
The study will answer the research question: Is a full-
scale RCT of interpersonal counselling for young people
with mild depression delivered in non-specialist commu-
nity services feasible? In this feasibility RCT, 60 eligible
young people will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to re-
ceive to IPC-A or treatment as usual. Participants will be
assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation) and followed up
at 10 weeks and 23 weeks. The feasibility trial will recruit
young people presenting with low mood, who are receiv-
ing support from participating services in Norfolk and
Suffolk Counties in the UK. A process evaluation has
been incorporated to explore how the intervention is im-
plemented across the two sites. Qualitative data will be
collected by site profile questionnaires, observations of
IPC-A training workshops and supervision, video/audio
recordings of treatment sessions (both IPC-A and TAU),
interviews with participants (and parents) from the IPC-
A and TAU arms and focus groups with youth mental
health workers and wider stakeholders.Abotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 3 of 14
Participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Participants will be young people accessing participating
services via each service ’ss t a n d a r dr e f e r r a lp a t h w a y sa s
detailed below. Young people will be triaged and assessed
according to each service ’s standard procedures. If this as-
sessment identifies low mood as a presenting difficulty,
the case will be discussed with a clinical member of the re-
search team (without identifying the young person) to as-
certain likely suitability for the trial. The service will have
the option of using the RCADS depression scale to help
determine suitability, with a cut-off of 11 or over suggest-
ing suitability (this cut-off will not be an absolute). RCAD
S is a primary outcome measure for the feasibility trial,
and for that matter, it will be completed as part of the
baseline assessment irrespective of its use by services to
determine eligibility. In line with the approach used suc-
cessfully in the pilot, study eligibility criteria have been
kept to a minimum to reflect service eligibility criteria in
order to increase the external validity of the trial in the
context of non-specialist services.
Inclusion criteria
/C15Aged 12 –18 years
/C15Seeking help for low mood (as the primary
presenting difficulty)
/C15Of a level of illness where they would normally
receive treatment from the participating service
/C15Able to provide written informed consent or, for
under 16 years, written informed assent and parent/
guardian consent
Exclusion criteria
/C15Learning disability necessitating non-mainstream
schooling
/C15Current psychotic disorder
/C15Current substance dependence
/C15Current significant suicidal ideation (K-SADS-
PL—‘suicidal ideation ’threshold —‘often thinks of
suicide and has thought of a specific method ’)
There will not be a numerical upper severity
threshold. The upper threshold comes under ‘Of a
level of illness where they would normally receive
treatment from the service ’. An interesting outcome
of our initial IPC single-arm pilot was that some
young people with severe depression (according to
ratings questionnaires) are routinely treated by some
early help services. Reasons are multiple. It is import-
ant to examine this in the wider range of services in
the planned study; indeed, the planned study will
more formally identify the range of depression sever-
ity seen in these services and what treatments are ef-
fective here. But the purpose of this study is not toexamine/change referral thresholds, rather to investi-
gate optimal treatments for young people in this
service.
Setting
The trial will be conducted in two counties in England.
While the sites are in the area served by one NHS men-
tal health trust, Tier 1/2 services or services for mild de-
pression are not delivered by this mental health trust, as
the severity of illness of young people is generally below
the thresholds for NHS specialist child and adolescent
mental health services. Treatment at this level is deliv-
ered by a range of services locally.
Within the two counties, these non-specialist mental
health support services for children and young people
are provided by county councils such as Early Help
teams, Young People ’s teams, Family Support services,
school nurses, and NEET (not in education, employment
or training) teams. In addition, two publicly commis-
sioned independent counselling organisations will also
be involved in the study. Such tier 1 or 2 services pro-
vide early interventions to children and young people
with mild mental health problems and/or difficult family
circumstances such as parental drug and alcohol de-
pendency, poor mental health and domestic abuse. Prac-
titioners working in these services are not qualified
mental health practitioners but may have some training
in counselling, family work and social care. Staff deliver-
ing the IPC and TAU interventions will be employees of
these organisations, doing this as part of their regular
job. Having this variety of services involved will give a
good balance of generalisability while making the study
feasible within the cost envelope.
Intervention: Interpersonal Counselling for Adolescents
(IPC-A)
IPC-A is a brief manualised psychological intervention,
derived from IPT. IPC helps clients to identify the recip-
rocal interaction between their current depressive symp-
toms and interpersonal relationships, with a focus on
one of four domains: grief, relationship disputes, big
changes, and loneliness and isolation. The therapist
works with the client to identify effective strategies to
deal with their interpersonal problems, which should im-
prove depressive symptoms.
IPC-A is an adapted form of IPC designed to suit the
needs of adolescents. The intervention is delivered over
three to six (30 –60 min) sessions, depending on partici-
pant needs. IPC-A is based on the manual developed by
Weissman et al. [ 28]. The core interventions are the
same as in the adult manual; however, language and ex-
amples are adapted to make them more relevant to
adolescents. While we are testing efficacy of IPC-A, the
manual is available for researchers interested inAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 4 of 14
conducting research on it, on request from PW, the se-
nior author of this paper. IPC-A arm participants will
also have access to standard health and care provision
(treatment as usual) throughout their participation, such
as family work; the extent to which provision of IPC-A
alters use of these services will be monitored using the
Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI).
Staff to be trained as IPC-A therapists will receive two
full days of initial training, followed by weekly supervi-
sion until adequate competency levels have been demon-
strated (two sessions for each of two cases above quality
threshold on IPC audiorecording rating scale [ 27]). De-
tailed training on complicated issues such as grief, and
weekly supervision is likely to reduce harm from therapy
(which will itself be asked about in the process evalu-
ation). Following successful completion of this training,
therapists will receive monthly clinical supervision.
Where possible, supervision will be provided in a group
format to allow therapists to explore the theory and
practice of IPC through engaging in shared discussion of
real-world cases. Each supervision session will last up to
1.5 h. Supervision will be delivered by PW, VC and ST,
all trained IPT/IPC supervisors, with VC having overall
responsibility for coordinating the provision of clinical
supervision. Attendance at and costs of training and
supervision will be recorded as therapy costs.
Control: treatment as usual
The control arm will receive ‘treatment as usual ’(TAU):
the standard support provided by services. Participants
will not be denied access to any treatment option avail-
able as part of current provision; however, staff provid-
ing individual support to TAU participants will not have
attended any IPC-A training and will not receive any
IPC-A supervision, to minimise contamination. Staff
trained as IPC-A therapists will be required by contract
not to discuss any aspect of their training or supervision
with colleagues not trained in IPC-A.
There appear some variations in TAU options offered
to young people by participating teams. County differ-
ences in service commissioning, locality or team differ-
ences in service provision may contribute to these
variations. The process evaluation arm of this study and
the CSRI has been designed to capture the interventions
that constitute TAU as part of the study. At its core, all
TAU encompasses a risk assessment framework used to-
gether with the families to identify and assess risk and
appropriately plan to meet the needs of young people
and their family. Where appropriate, practitioners offer
counselling, themed group sessions, advice and informa-
tion for parents/carers, and telephone support. Early
Help Family Practitioners offer direct work to children
and young people and their families who may focus on
building self-esteem, supporting access to other services,supporting reintegration into education (if applicable)
and working with the young person and families to
understand and prevent risk.
Although the practitioners delivering these services in
both IPC and control arms do not have core mental
health professional training, they may consult with or
offer a joint appointment with a mental health profes-
sional (e.g. primary mental health worker or clinical
psychologist) or signpost/refer the young person to other
local services.
Recruitment procedure
Young people will be triaged and assessed by the refer-
ring service according to each service ’s standard proce-
dures. If this assessment identifies low mood as a
presenting difficulty, the case will be discussed with a
clinical member of the research team (without identify-
ing the young person) to ascertain likely suitability for
the trial. Potentially suitable young people (and/or par-
ents/carers if under 16) will be invited to participate. If
they express an interest, consent will be given to the ser-
vice to pass on their details to the research team. We are
requesting teams only pass potential cases to the trial if
therapy in both IPC and TAU can start within a couple
of weeks of the baseline assessment, so differential wait-
ing times do not bias results.
Those who express an interest will be contacted by the
trial ’s research practitioner who will further explain the
study, answer any queries and provide copies of partici-
pant information sheets. Potential participants will be
given at least 48 h to read and consider the information
before being asked for consent.
If the young person wishes to participate following this
process, the research practitioner will arrange a meeting
at a convenient venue (e.g. their home address, school/
college or a community venue), where the young person
will be asked to complete a consent form (if 16 or over)
or assent form (if under 16) at the start of the first re-
search assessment to document the informed consent/
assent process and their willingness to participate. For
young people under 16, in addition to the child ’s assent
to participation, the consent of a parent or carer (adult
with parental responsibility) will be required for the
young person to be included in the study. Consent to
participate in an interview as part of the process evalu-
ation will be sought during the main consent proce-
dures. However, it will not be a requirement that a
young person/parent consents to a process evaluation
interview in order to be included in the study.
After informed consent has been appropriately ob-
tained, participants will be asked to complete all baseline
assessment measures. Only those who meet the eligibil-
ity criteria outlined above will be randomised. It is envis-
aged that a close liaison between the researchAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 5 of 14
practitioner and referring teams, and the subsequent
telephone conversation with potential participants before
baseline visit will ensure most referrals will conform to
the eligibility criteria before the baseline assessment.
However, in cases (which will be rare) where young per-
sons do not meet the eligibility criteria after baseline as-
sessment, it will be conveyed to them sensitively, and
the research practitioner will liaise with the referring
team to ensure the appropriate service is sought for the
young person.
All staff members to be trained in the intervention will
be given a verbal explanation of the objectives of the
study, what he or she will be asked to do if they choose
to participate and the possible risks and benefits of par-
ticipation. Participation in the trial is not a condition of
training. Participation in the process evaluation (listen-
ing to audiotapes of therapy and/or focus groups) is op-
tional; staff will be given participant information sheets
and asked for informed written consent to take part. Fig-
ure1is a flowchart diagram for this study.
Sample size
Sixty eligible young people will be randomised all to-
gether. The sample size is not based upon estimation of
efficacy but is in keeping with published suggestions [ 29]
and believed to be practically possible within the limits
of the project. Further, it should enable us to assess rates
of recruitment and retention to a reasonable degree of
precision; assuming an attrition rate of around 20%, a
sample of 60 would provide an estimate with 95% confi-
dence interval of width 20% (i.e. +/ −10%). For a recruit-
ment rate of around 50%, the interval width would be
around 25% (i.e. +/ −12.5%).
Randomisation
Randomisation will be coordinated remotely by the Nor-
wich Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). Participants will be ran-
domised in a 1:1 allocation ratio, using a stochastic
minimisation algorithm to minimise imbalance between
groups in baseline symptom severity, gender and study
site. Allocation will be managed by the Data Manage-
ment Team at Norwich CTU via a web-based system; it
will not be accessible by anyone outside of this team, in-
cluding the research team, trial therapists and partici-
pants; thus, allocation concealment will be maintained.
Blinding
Research practitioners collecting follow-up data will be
blind to the participant ’s treatment allocation. Another
member of the research team will pass details of alloca-
tion to the clinical service. Given the nature of the inter-
vention, it will not be possible for participants and those
involved in delivering the intervention to remain blind.
Following allocation, all participants in the study andtherapists will be asked not to reveal the group to which
the participants were randomised to the research practi-
tioner. Participants will be reminded at the beginning of
each contact with the research practitioner post-
randomisation not to disclose their allocation. Any po-
tentially unblinding data will be stored separately in a
database to which the research practitioner will not have
access. In the case of accidental unblinding during the
research process, a second research practitioner will
complete the outstanding measures.
Data collection
Outcome measures
Participants will be assessed at baseline (pre-randomisa-
tion) and followed up at 10 weeks and 23 weeks, with an
additional 5-week follow-up (online with telephone sup-
port). The following outcome measures will be used:
demographic characteristics of young person; Kiddie
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-
SADS) depression section to assess for presence of DSM
depressive disorders [ 30,31]; Revised Children ’s Anxiety
and Depression Scale (RCADS) to assess self-rated se-
verity of symptoms across depression, anxiety disorders
and OCD [ 32]; Family Assessment Device (FAD) to
measure quality of family relationships of participants
[33]; Cambridge Friendships Questionnaire (CFQ),
which measures quality of peer relationships of partici-
pants [ 34]; Employment, Education or Training in previ-
ous 4 weeks (NEET status), to capture levels of inactivity
amongst young people who are not in work, education
or training; Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing
Scale, which will measure mental wellbeing [ 29]; Modi-
fied Client Service Receipt Inventory (Modified CSRI),
which will record information on service utilisation, in-
come, accommodation and other cost-related variables
[35]; and Health-related quality of life measured using
the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) [ 36].
The RCADS [ 32], FAD [ 33]a n dC F Q[ 34]w i l lb er e -
peated at an online week 5-follow-up. All outcome mea-
sures will be repeated at week 10 and 23 follow-up except
for demographic characteristics of young person and the
K-SADS depression section. Information about gender of
therapist, attendance/non-attendance at planned therapy
sessions and location of sessions will be collected by thera-
pists in both treatment arms.
Table 1shows the schedule of enrolment, interven-
tions and assessments in accordance with the SPIRIT
guidelines.
Health economic data
We shall measure use of NHS and community resources
related to mental health. All resources required to im-
plement the intervention, including providing training,
ongoing clinical supervision, staff time to deliver theAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 6 of 14
intervention, any consumables and materials required
and any other necessary expenditure will be captured.
We will use a modified version of the Client Service Re-
ceipt Inventory (CSRI) [ 35] completed at each follow-up
time point (baseline, 10 and 23 weeks). We shall use the
CHU-9D [ 36] to measure health-related quality of life
(HRQoL), which will be administered at baseline, week
10 and week 23.
Process evaluation data
The trial will employ a mixed-methods ethnographic
process evaluation to (a) provide a description of how
IPC-A and TAU are delivered, (b) assess implementation
and theoretical fidelity to the IPC-A model over time, (c)observe how delivery is shaped by the context of differ-
ing service models, (d) identify any harms arising from
treatment (including end of treatment) and (e) establish
the extent and source of any contamination of the con-
trol arm.
Data collection methods will include:
–Site profile questionnaires (one per provider
administered at the beginning and end of the trial)
–Observations of IPC-A training workshops and
supervision
–Video/audio recordings of treatment sessions (both
IPC-A and TAU; all treatment sessions will be re-
corded, subject to consent)Fig. 1 Flow chartAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 7 of 14
–Interviews with participants (young person and a
parent/carer) from the IPC-A and TAU arms ( n=
20)
–Focus groups with youth mental health workers
(one per arm per provider)
–Focus group with wider stakeholders
Video/audio recording of treatment sessions
A random selection of therapy sessions (15% in each
arm) will be rated by one of the supervisors according to
the IPC-A Audiorecording Rating Scale [ 27], to monitor
implementation fidelity to the IPC-A treatment model
and to assess the degree of contamination. This scale in-
cludes ratings of techniques for the assessment (e.g.
‘Complete an Interpersonal Inventory ’) and ending ses-
sions, for specific focus areas (e.g. ‘Exploration anddiscussion of differences in expectations ’for relationship
disputes), and general IPC techniques to be used for all
sessions (e.g. ‘Clear focus on depressive symptoms and
interpersonal relationships ’).
Selection of sessions will be ongoing throughout the
study. Feedback will be given to the therapist from the
supervisor for IPC-A cases, to aid continued develop-
ment. This process will be ongoing through the study so
such feedback is timely. We accept that therapists in the
TAU arm are less likely to submit sessions, but we shall
regularly meet with teams and explain the importance of
us rating sessions from both arms of the study, and that
the aim of this is to check what TAU is and whether it
contains IPC-A; the purpose is not to rate the quality of
their therapy. Using findings from supervisor ’s ratings of
IPC-A sessions, a purposive sub-sample of extracts fromTable 1 SPIRIT Schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments
*The duration between initial screening and randomisation will vary depending on the time it takes a participant to complete baseline measures. Howe ver, we
anticipate that all participants will be randomised within 4 weeks of their initial screening appointmentAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 8 of 14
recordings will also be selected (sampled to include
maximum variation in delivery) and qualitatively ana-
lysed to evaluate theoretical fidelity.
Young person/parent interviews
Twenty young people participating in the RCT (10 per
arm) will be invited to take part in in-depth interviews
after their final assessments (23-week assessment). A
separate interview will be undertaken with a parent/
carer (all parents whose child participates will be in-
vited). These parents/carers will complete a separate
consent form for this interview. The research practi-
tioner will have ongoing dialogue with parents/carers
about their potential participation in the interviews dur-
ing the follow-up visits. Participation in the interviews
will be ascertained at the final research assessment. Par-
ticipants will be asked about their experience and views
of the process of accessing help, the content of sessions,
contacts had in addition to study therapy sessions, how
they feel they have benefitted or not from receiving the
intervention, the experience of ending therapy and sug-
gestions for improvement.
As with all clinical trials, there remains the possibility
for some participants to withdraw from the study. There
is a process in place to accurately record participant
withdrawals/dropouts from the study. It will be estab-
lished whether participants withdraw from the therapy
(either IPC-A or TAU) and/or from the whole trial.
Those who withdraw from therapy only will be followed
up and invited to participate in the process evaluation
interviews, while those who withdraw from the whole
trial will be lost to follow-up and interviews.
Staff focus groups
Following completion of delivery of the IPC-A and TAU
arms, focus groups will take place in participating services
to understand staff perspectives of each study arm. These
will be separate for IPC and TAU therapists. For IPC-A
therapists, discussion will focus on barriers and facilitators
to successful delivery, experiences and views of interven-
tion sessions, additional work required to support delivery
of IPC and suggestions for improvement. For TAU thera-
pists, discussion will focus on how TAU is delivered, the
additional support YP in TAU have received and their
awareness and perspectives of IPC-A.
Focus group with professional stakeholders
At the end of the study, an additional focus group will
be conducted with commissioners, education representa-
tives and service managers to review study findings and
discuss implementation barriers and sustainability of
implementation.Site profile questionnaires
Questionnaires at the beginning and end of study will
aim to understand the broader service context in which
the intervention is delivered, including TAU for young
people with mental health needs; policies, protocols and
procedures used by staff; numbers of YP with mental
health needs and proportion with depression; training
and experience of staff in treating depression in YP; and
allocation and distribution of staff to support YP with
mental health needs.
Analysis
Statistical
Recruitment and retention rates will be estimated with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Assuming sufficient in-
formation, time until drop-out will be analysed using
‘time-to-event ’methods, i.e. in an effort to identify base-
line factors likely to be related to drop-out. The pro-
posed primary outcome measure for the definitive RCT
is the RCADS depression score at 10 weeks. Although
the proposed study is not designed to assess efficacy, the
mean between-group difference will be estimated using
a general linear model including baseline RCADS de-
pression score and treating therapist as a random effect.
A 95% CI will be constructed to assess whether the
treatment benefit is feasibly greater than the minimal
clinically significant difference, i.e. whether or not it is
included within the CI. A similar approach will be
undertaken for the secondary outcome measures. The
rate of completion of each outcome measure will be re-
ported. If appropriate, depending on the proportion of
missing values, multiple imputation will be undertaken
and between-group differences re-estimated as a sensi-
tivity analysis. Further parameters, such as within group
variation, needed for the design of a subsequent full-
scale trial, will also be estimated. All statistical analysis
will be undertaken using STATA.
Health economic analysis
As this is a feasibility study, it will not be possible to
demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention
because the study will not be powered to demonstrate
effectiveness. However, we shall collect information to
inform the design of the economic evaluation planned
for the future definitive trial. This will yield useful infor-
mation, such as the likely cost of the intervention and
key components of resource use. It will also inform the
design of health economic data collection instruments in
the future fully powered trial.
The resources required to provide the interventions
(IPC-A and TAU) will be recorded. These would include
training, ongoing clinical supervision, staff time and sal-
ary costs required to provide the intervention, consum-
ables and materials required, and any other necessaryAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 9 of 14
expenditure. Each session offered (and its location) in
both arms will be explicitly recorded. Recording of all
events will be built into the design of the study and
study CRF. These will be combined with appropriate
unit cost data to provide an estimate of the cost of pro-
viding IPC-A. It will also be possible to conduct scenario
analyses to estimate changes in the cost of provision if
any assumptions about how the service is provided are
changed. It will be important to measure any resources
related to participants ’mental health in both the inter-
vention and control groups. This will be conducted by
means of a modified CSRI [ 35] conducted at baseline, 10
and 23 weeks. The time frame requested for the baseline
and 10-week CSRI will be any use of services in the last
10 weeks. For the 23-week assessment, the time frame
will be the last 13 weeks. To reduce burden on partici-
pants, the a priori aim is to make the modified CSRI as
simple as possible but to still capture relevant and im-
portant service use. Any modifications made will be
made in consultation with other ICALM investigators.
The CSRI will be collected by means of a face-to-face
interview.
Resource use data will be analysed to highlight any po-
tential areas of differences between trial arms in use of
NHS and social care services, including emergency de-
partment attendances. The measure of health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) used in this study will be the
CHU-9D. One important outcome of the feasibility
study will be an assessment of the suitability of this in-
strument and the modified CSRI for use in a future full-
scale trial.
Process evaluation analysis
A linguistic ethnographic methodology [ 37,38] will be
employed to analyse how relationships, roles and mo-
ments of intervention delivery are organised within the
contexts of delivery. This will be achieved by (1) setting
out macro, meso and micro contextual features relevant
to implementation within each provider; (2) targeting
where likely tensions in implementation are likely to
occur at each contextual level; then (3) searching for
‘disruptions ’to targeted activities involved in interven-
tion delivery; and (4) considering the consequences of
these disruptions for how the intervention was imple-
mented and the implications of these for scaled up im-
plementation in a future definitive trial.
The linguistic ethnographic process evaluation meth-
odology combines strengths of linguistics and ethnog-
raphy to systematically investigate human behaviour
within context. A particular strength is that it provides
methodological tools for empirically exposing relation-
ships between talk, non-verbal behaviour and the con-
texts in which such behaviour is produced. This is
particularly helpful for evaluating the interpersonalcounselling intervention, which trains local authority
and other non-NHS services to communicate effectively
with adolescents.
To manage the quality and range of data collected as
part of the process evaluation, analysis will involve work-
ing laterally across data types. We will seek to provide a
broad description of intervention delivery but, instead of
allocating equal time to the analysis of each case, we will
focus on identifying ‘telling cases ’, triangulating and
looking for connections between data. The analysis of
qualitative data will be iterative, moving between data
collection and data analysis to test emerging theories.
Care will be taken to identify and follow up deviant cases
which do not fit into emerging theories. Emerging theor-
ies and the relationship of the data to the conceptual lit-
erature underpinning the intervention will be discussed
and refined at team meetings throughout the research.
Researchers ’field notes from observations of training
and supervision of IPC-A therapists will be analysed the-
matically to provide a detailed description of process
and content of staff training and supervision. Interviews
with individual young persons and focus groups with
staff and stakeholders will be transcribed verbatim and
thematically analysed with the aid of NVivo software.
For intervention arm participants, we will then develop a
coding scheme to evaluate how the process and content
of IPC-A as delivered by the youth mental health
workers have functioned from the participants ’perspec-
tive. In the control arm, we will assess how participants
experienced the treatment as usual provided by their
youth mental health worker and any other sources of
support used. A constant comparison approach will be
adopted, working iteratively between data obtained from
different interviewees within and between implementa-
tion sites.
The ratings of IPC-A sessions will be used to monitor
implementation fidelity to the IPC-A treatment model
and to assess the degree of contamination. If contamin-
ation of the TAU arm is identified, data generated
through observations, interviews and focus groups will
be used to explore the mechanisms by which contamin-
ation occurs and how this might be mitigated against in
a future trial. To evaluate theoretical fidelity, the purpos-
ive sample of extracts of recorded IPC-A sessions will be
transcribed according to Jeffersonian conventions and
subject to conversation analysis in order to identify how
IPC-A components are communicated by therapists and
received by young people, including how the mecha-
nisms of the IPC-A intervention function to affect
change within and across individual counselling sessions.
By framing the analysis of intervention implementation
within a macro, meso and micro contextual framework,
we will be able to make the transition from the identifi-
cation of routines and patterns of use in the specificAbotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 10 of 14
services participating in the current study to theoretical
explanations of how different structural relations and
mechanisms of the intervention organise moments of
delivery, which then impact on specific outcomes. In
drawing case comparisons across participating services,
we will develop hypotheses about why the intervention
is linked to outcomes which we can test in a future de-
finitive trial. This may lead us to identify factors which
are plausibly and/or consistently related to successful or
unsuccessful delivery of the components of the interven-
tion. Emerging theories and the relationship of the data
to the theory underpinning IPC-A will be discussed and
refined in team meetings throughout the research.
Patient and public involvement
Protocol development was informed by two PPI events
attended by 14 young people, most with personal experi-
ence of accessing mental health services. The first event
was held at a local school and the second with members
of Suffolk Children & Young People, Action and Trans-
formation (CAT) group. The young people we consulted
stressed the inadequacy of current mental health
provision for young people and supported the idea of ex-
tending access to treatment by training existing staff
working with young people to deliver IPC-A. They told
us that knowing workers have appropriate training is im-
portant to building trust and that they would prefer to
be treated somewhere familiar to them rather than at-
tend a specialist clinic.
We have engaged two Youth Advisory Groups, made
up of young people with personal experience of low
mood, for the feasibility RCT stage. Based in the two
counties in the UK where the study will be conducted,
each group is made up of 4 –5 members, and they have
been involved and will continue to be involved in key
decisions regarding the conduct of the trial, interpret-
ation of the results and dissemination of the findings.
The Youth Advisory Group will be facilitated by ST who
will be the dedicated PPI lead co-applicant for the trial.
ST is a Co-Production Advisor who works as part of
Suffolk County Council ’s Engagement Hub. She is skilled
in facilitating the engagement of young people with
mental health needs. ST will act as a point of contact for
the young people involved and ensure their welfare by
offering emotional support and signposting to appropri-
ate services if young people need further support as a re-
sult of the sensitive nature of the research.
Two representatives of the Youth Advisory Group sit
on the trial steering committee (TSC). They will be sup-
ported by ST to prepare for and attend these meetings.
Involving this number of young people will increase the
breadth of experience and skills and allow for group
members to support and encourage each other, while
ensuring that all members are able to contributemeaningfully; it will also allow for attrition, as young
people choose to leave the group.
Based on our experience in previous trials, we antici-
pate that involving young people with relevant lived-
experiences as members of the research team will en-
hance our ability to successfully recruit and retain par-
ticipants and to effectively communicate the study ’s
findings to a broad range of stakeholders. The Youth
Advisory Panel will be involved in hosting the public dis-
semination event and in preparing reports of the find-
ings for trial participants and the public.
Progression criteria
Feasibility outcomes The primary output of this feasi-
bility trial will be the design of the subsequent full-scale
trial. The TSC will assess the trial against the following
criteria and make recommendations regarding the suit-
ability of the proposed design for the full-scale trial,
based on the extent to which these criteria are met.
(a) Recruitment rate is at least 80% of target
(b) At least 70% of those randomised to receive the
intervention attend at least three therapy sessions
within the 10-week treatment window
(c) Follow-up assessments are completed by at least
80% of participants at 10 weeks and 70% of
participants at 23 weeks
(d) At least 80% of IPC treatment sessions reviewed
meet treatment fidelity criteria
(e) Contamination of the control arm can be
sufficiently limited for individual randomisation to
be justified
(f) The mean RCADS depression scores of the IPC-A
and TAU groups at 10 weeks are indicative of a
clinically significant difference in depression (3
points)
The rate of completion of each outcome measure will
be calculated and acceptability assessed via the process
evaluation. We shall estimate the expected cost of the
intervention and likely drivers of cost. The results of the
feasibility study, the views of participants in the stake-
holder focus group and guidelines from the Medical Re-
search Council (MRC) on developing and evaluating
complex interventions, will inform research design for
subsequent research. If the proposed method is unable
to limit contamination adequately, then a cluster trial or
stepped wedge design will be considered. We will rec-
ommend an internal pilot study if outcomes from feasi-
bility suggest that substantial changes to the protocol
are required before progression. If the above criteria are
met, we will apply for funding to progress to a multi-
site, assessor-blind, RCT of the effectiveness and cost-Abotsie et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:191 Page 11 of 14
effectiveness of IPC-A in comparison to TAU for adoles-
cents presenting to non-specialist services with depres-
sive symptoms, informed by our feasibility results.
Ultimately, if a future trial demonstrates IPC to be ef-
fective, an IPC-A training programme could be imple-
mented nationally. This would facilitate rapid expansion
of the therapy workforce, increasing access to evidence-
based treatment for adolescent depression.
Ethics and dissemination We obtained ethics approval
from the NHS Health Research Authority Cambridge
South Research Ethics Committee (UK). The study was
reviewed for its scientific design, data collection
methods, plan of analysis, risk assessment and manage-
ment, and ethics. Additional local research approvals
were obtained from the two participating County coun-
cils in England and all other participating organisations.
Findings of the feasibility trial will be disseminated to
trial participants, commissioners, service managers, ser-
vice users and their parents, clinicians and academics.
Dissemination vehicles will include regular study news-
letters, a public dissemination event, publications in
peer-reviewed journals and presentation at scientific
conferences. Study results will also be shared with the
National Children and Young People ’s Mental Health
improvement team.
We shall work with our young advisors to disseminate
findings to the public in a way that is accessible to young
people, perhaps using YouTube/Instagram/other social
media. Young people will be involved in hosting our
public dissemination event.
Discussion
A strong commitment to improve mental health services
for children and young people was set out in 2015 ’sFu-
ture in Mind [39] and 2016 ’sFive Year Forward View for
Mental Health [40], and reaffirmed in the recent Green
Paper, Transforming children and young people ’s mental
health provision [41]. The Five Year Forward View set
the ambition to expand the provision of community-
based psychotherapy to an additional 70,000 young
people by 2020/21, necessitating a substantial expansion
of the therapy workforce. The NHS Long Term Plan [42]
further continues to invest in the improvement and de-
velopment of CYP MH services. Achieving this goal of
improved access to treatment will require a joint-agency
approach and a greater focus on providing evidence-
based interventions outside of specialist CAMHS.
Utilising the skills of the existing staff members by
training them to deliver evidence-based interventions
will be essential to meeting workforce requirements.
However, there is currently no evidence to support deci-
sions about which interventions these staff members
should be trained to deliver. The proposed research aimsto contribute to this evidence-base. The study is in line
with the Department of Health ’sFramework for Mental
Health Research , which recommends that research
should focus on early intervention and the voluntary
sector. We propose that IPC-A could be an effective
treatment for young people with depression, which
could be delivered by such non-specialist services.
In order to contribute to the evidence-base for inter-
ventions for adolescent depression that can be delivered
outside of specialist CAMHS, an evaluation of the effect-
iveness and cost-effectiveness of IPC-A is needed. How-
ever, before a definitive randomised controlled trial can
be justified, there are a number of feasibility questions
that need answering. In particular, the process of recruit-
ing, randomising and conducting research assessments is
not part of normal practice in non-specialist services,
and it is important to demonstrate that this is feasible.
