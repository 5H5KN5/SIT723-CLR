Abstract
Background: Pediatric obesity is a multi-faceted public health conc ern that can lead to cardiovascular diseases, cancers,
and early mortality. Small changes in diet, physical activity, or BMI can significantly reduce the possibility of developing
cardiometabolic risk factors. Family-based behavioral interventions are an underutilized, evidence-based approach that have
been found to significantly prevent excess weight gain and obes ity in children and adolescents. Poor program availability,
low participation rates, and non-adherence are noted barriers to positive outcomes. Effective interventions for pediatric
obesity in primary care are hampered by low family functi oning, motivation, and adher ence to recommendations.
Methods: This (type II) hybrid effectiveness –implementation randomized trial t ests the Family Check-Up 4 Health
(FCU4Health) program, which was designed to target he alth behavior change in children by improving family
management practices and parenting skills, with the goal of preventing obesity and excess weight gain. The FCU4Health is
assessment driven to tailor services and increase parent motivation. A sample of 350 families with children aged 6 to
12 years who are identified as overweight or obese (BMI ≥85th percentile for age and gender) will be enrolled at three
primary care clinics [two Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) and a children ’s hospital]. All clinics serve
predominantly Medicaid patients and a large ethnic minority population, including Latinos, African Americans, and
American Indians who face disparities in obesity, cardiometabolic risk, and access to care. The FCU4Health will be
coordinated with usual care, using two different delive ry strategies: an embedded approach for the two FQHCs and a
referral model for the hospital-based clinic. To assess program e ffectiveness (BMI, body composition, child health behaviors,
parenting, and utilization of support services) and implemen tation outcomes (such outcome s as acceptability, adoption,
feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, and cost), we use a multi -method and multi-informant assessment strategy including
electronic health record data, behavioral observation, questionnaires, interviews, and cost capture methods.

Background
Childhood obesity has become the leading preventable
cause of death worldwide [1]. Po or diet/nutrition and phys-
ical inactivity are the leading and preventable contributors
to obesity and are among the principal causes of chronic
disease and mortality for youths [2]. Obesity is also related
to psychosocial issues in youth, such as depression and aca-
demic disengagement [3 –5]. In the USA in 2013 –2014, it
was estimated that 18% of all 6 –11-year-old children were
obese and that a disproportionate number are disadvan-
taged economically and socially [6]. Obesity and its health
consequences are disproportion ately distributed across the
USA; Mexican Americans, American Indians, and African
Americans have the highest prevalence rates of obesity in
childhood at 41.1 to 56.3% [6 –9]. Social determinants of
health [10] play a key role in the childhood obesity and
contribute substantially to disparities. In the social environ-
ment, stress and discrimination are acutely experienced by
minority and low-income communities in the USA and are
linked with childhood obesity [11]. Physical environment
barriers include limited access to safe areas for play and
fresh, nutritious foods [12]. Finally, access to health services
that can prevent obesity and its sequelae [13] is limited for
members of underserved groups [14].
While addressing the social determinants of health is an
ongoing task, significant evide nce supports the effectiveness
of lifestyle modification on car diometabolic risk factors, with
even small changes yielding sign ificant impact [15]. Recently
published reviews [16, 17] indicate that youth health behav-
iors and obesity may be improved when parents attend and
are directly involved with services [18] and are provided
training in the skills require d to support lifestyle modifica-
tion in accordance with expert guidelines [16, 19 –21].
Primary care is a promising context for improving parent-
ing behaviors linked to child health [22 –24]. Most children
access a primary care provider a nnually [25, 26], caregivers
are present at visits, and physicians have a high level of per-
ceived authority among parents who look to them for advice
on children ’s health. The National Academy of Medicine,
the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Endocrine
Society, among others, promote a family-centered interven-
tion in primary care [27 –29]. Despite the appeal of a family-
centered approach [30, 31], sev eral barriers hinder imple-
mentation of such programs in real-world healthcaresystems [29, 32]. For example, healthcare providers report
inadequate time, training, and resources to effectively
work with parents to address childhood obesity [33]. Few
comprehensive and prospective evaluations of the imple-
mentation of weight management programs in primary
care have been done, despite such factors as inadequate
cost evaluation being a top reason for failure to adopt
behavioral interventions [34] and the general concern
about delivery with sufficient fidelity to preserve effective-
ness [35]. To have a population impact on pediatric
obesity, there is a pressing need for scalable programs that
can be delivered in primary care and engage parents in
behavior change strategies for children [32].
The Family Check-Up for Health program
The Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) is an adapta-
tion and enhancement of the original Family Check-Up
(FCU), an evidence-based, family-centered intervention
with empirical evidence of effectiveness and feasible
delivery in real-world systems that provide care for cultur-
ally diverse, low-income families [36 –39]. Initially designed
and tested as a behavioral health intervention, the FCU
employs motivational intervi ewing (MI) to engage parents
in family management strategies and community-based
support services [40]. Extensive data document the FCU ’s
clinical effectiveness and high rates of engagement among
underserved and ethnic minority families [36 –38, 41 –43].
Although not targeted by the program, the FCU demon-
strated long-term collateral effects on nutrition (ages 2 –5)
and obesity (ages 2 to 10 years) [44] and on those from
adolescence to early adulthood (ages 12 to 22 years) [13,
44]. Improvement in parent –child relationships and posi-
tive behavior support mediated the effects of the FCU on
nutrition and obesity in both developmental periods. Based
on these findings, the FCU4Health was developed to specif-
ically target pediatric obesity in primary care, the front-line
service setting for preventio n of obesity and excess weight
gain [29]. This involved enhancing the content to focus on
helping parents support child and family behaviors that lead
to a healthy weight, and adapting the delivery strategy for
the primary care context (Smit h JD, Berkel C, Rudo-Stern J,
Montaño Z, Mauricio AM, Dishion TJ, St. George SM,
Prado G, Chiapa A, Bruening MM, The Family Check-Up 4
Health (FCU4Health): The process of adapting anSmith et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:11 Page 2 of 15
evidence-based parenting program for prevention of
pediatric obesity and excess weight gain in primary care,
submitted).
The FCU4Health is unique relative to other obesity in-
terventions in that rather than solely targeting knowledge
about national health guidelines (published by such or-
ganizations as the American Academy of Pediatrics and
United States Department of Agriculture that require up-
dating over time), it provides parents with the skills and
support to implement the changes recommended by
physicians, dieticians, and other members of the health-
care team. This aspect fills an important gap for families
who earnestly agree to improve children ’s diet, physical
activity, sleep habits, or screen time while in the clinic but
encounter difficulties in their regular involvement that
lead to an abandonment of these efforts. It also increases
the individualizability of the intervention to the needs of
the family and reduces training time and the need for
regular updates to program materials.
The core components of the FCU4Health mirror those
of the original FCU: an ecological assessment of the
family, a feedback and motivation session, and follow-up
services that are individually tailored in content and dos-
age based on identified needs in the assessment (see
Fig. 1). These follow-up services may include parenting
modules for needs related to family management and/or
care coordination with community-based services to ad-
dress ecological needs [38]. Parenting modules follow
Everyday Parenting , [45] a 12-module skills-based cur-
riculum focusing on the three core areas of parenting
and family management: relationship quality, positive
behavior support, and monitoring and limit setting. The
application of these steps in this trial is described in
greater detail in the “Methods ”section.
Study design
Overview
We will test the FCU4Healtth with a type II hybrid
effectiveness –implementation trial [46], which enables
simultaneous evaluation of the clinical effectiveness andthe delivery of the FCU4Health program using two
different implementation strategies [47].
Implementation strategies and service delivery sites
The delivery model used by a given practice depends upon
their programmatic, fiscal, and resource characteristics
and needs [48]. Several approaches for the delivery of
behavioral health services in primary care settings have
been described [49]. In this trial, we partnered with three
pediatric primary care agencies that serve high rates of low-
income, ethnic minority families (about 60 –65% Latino;
10% African American; 5 –8% American Indian). Because
pediatric primary care offices often do not have integrated
behavioral health, arm 1 uses a strategy of coordinated care
between primary care and an external behavioral health
provider. We partnered with a large outpatient general
pediatrics clinic associated with a children ’sh o s p i t a l .W e
also partnered with two agencies that are part of the nation-
wide network of 1250 Federally Qualified Health Centers
(FQHCs). A feature of FQHCs is the integrated care model
that typifies the medical home. In arm 2, we will test an
integrated/co-located model of care. The FQHC network is
crucial for embedding a family-centered approach to care
because it serves youth and families at high sociodemo-
graphic risk and is intended to integrate services to reduce
barriers and improve care. Par tnering with these provider
sites afforded the opportunity to compare FCU4Health
implementation under two different real-life service deliv-
ery models. In both arms, behavioral health consultants are
responsible for delivering the FCU4Health and coordinat-
ing care with other support services and resources.
Clinical effectiveness of the FCU4Health
Within the two implementation strategy arms, eligible fam-
ilies are randomized to receive either the FCU4Health or
clinic services-as-usual plus community program informa-
tion (see “Methods ”). Primary clinical outcomes are child
BMI and body composition. Secondary outcomes, hypothe-
sized to mediate effects of the intervention on primary out-
comes, are lifestyle behaviors (diet and nutrition, physical

and sedentary activity, sleep) , child self-regulation, and
family management practices.
Methods
Study aims
Aim 1
Aim 1 was to finalize the adaptation of the FCU4Health,
which was initially adapted and piloted in pediatric pri-
mary healthcare [50], based on input from a community
advisory board (CAB) and partner clinics.
Aim 2
Aims 2 was to evaluate the effects of two delivery strategies:
integrated/co-located care an d coordinated care with refer-
ral. Using a mixed-methods approach applied to Proctor et
al.’s [51, 52] taxonomy, we will evaluate the process of
implementing the FCU4Health to inform, taking the
program to scale.
2a. Evaluate fidelity over time to the FCU4Health
using a validated observational rating system [ 53–55]
and develop and test an automated fidelity coding
system [ 56].
2b. Employ behavioral intervention costing methods
[57] to evaluate the costs of installing and delivering
the FCU4Health and conduct a cost –benefit analysis to
evaluate the monetary benefits of program effects.
2c. Develop a plan to support scale-up and sustainment
in collaboration with our CAB.
Aim 3
Aim 3 was to use pragmatic trial principles to test program
effects on primary and secondary outcomes. Intervention
effects on proximal outcomes will be tested as mediators
on the distal outcomes of child BMI and body composition.
Aim 4
Aim 4 was to carefully track utilization in each aspect of
the program, gather data concerning family ’s service deliv-
ery preferences and satisfaction, and test a model of pro-
gram implementation where f amily engagement mediates
the relation between fidelity and clinical outcomes [58].
Study participants, recruitment, and randomization
Families with children 5.5 to 12 years of age with BMI ≥
85th percentile for age and gender at study entry are eli-
gible to participate. Participants will be identified during
clinic well- and sick-child visits and through queries of
the Electronic Health Record (EHR). Enrolled families will
complete an ecological, family health routine assessment.
After the first assessment, families will be randomly
assigned to the FCU4Health ( n= 200) or Services-as-
Usual Plus Information condition ( n=1 5 0 ) u s i n g astratified block randomized design by child gender, age,
language (English, Spanish), and ethnicity. Assessing the
family prior to randomization ensures double-blinding at
baseline. Families in the intervention condition will
participate in the FCU4Health program, as outlined in the
next section, in addition to receiving usual care through
their clinic. Families are compensated for completing
assessments, but not for engaging in services. A CONSORT
table is presented in Fig. 2.
Family Check-Up 4 Health program
Delivery schedule
Previously, the FCU has used a health maintenance
approach, in which parents receive periodic (annual)
FCUs [38, 59]. Based on the US Preventive Services Task
Force recommendations that overweight/obese youth
should be provided with at least moderate treatment
dosage to affect weight management [60], we designed a
delivery schedule to achieve a minimum targeted dose of
intervention between 25 and 50 h over 6 months (assess-
ment and feedback at months 1, 3, and 6). Because of the
tailored approach, families with greater need and those
with greater motivation are expected to participate in
more follow-up services [61].
FCU4Health family health routine assessment
The family health routine assessment is ecological and
evaluates five broad domains —family health behaviors,
child health behaviors, family well-being and support,
child adjustment, and family management and relation-
ships —using a multi-agent battery of caregiver- and
child-reported questionnaires and a series of brief video-
recorded family interaction tasks (FITs). Two versions of
the assessment are used in this study: a full version at
months 1, 6, and 12 (90 min to complete) and a brief
version administered only at the 3-month assessment
(30 min). The full version includes all questionnaires
across the five broad domains and three FITs on the
topics of health and diet goals, monitoring and limit
setting of child health behaviors, and planning a fun
physically active family activity (4 min each). The brief
version includes only the questionnaires to caregiver and
child pertaining to family health behaviors and child
health behaviors and is intended as a low-burden oppor-
tunity to reinforce steps toward behavior change and
address areas that have not yet improved or potentially
shift focus to areas that have emerged during the first
3 months of intervention. Questionnaires are completed
in English or in Spanish by caregivers and the child
through a secure website accessed via a Wi-Fi enabled
tablet. Pencil-and-paper versions are available if needed.
FITs are recorded using the tablet and are uploaded to a
cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant portal for secure storage,
viewing, and scoring.Smith et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:11 Page 4 of 15
Feedback sessions
Feedback sessions follow the assessments in months 1,
3, and 6. The first feedback session begins with a discus-
sion to understand (a) the caregivers ’perception of their
needs; (b) their child ’s health, adjustment, and obeso-
genic behaviors; and (c) the caregivers ’motivation to
change parenting and family management practices in
support of health behavior change. In the second and
third feedbacks, the coordinator begins by checking in
with the family about their progress, discussing barriers
they are experiencing, and exploring the ways that the
previous feedback and Everyday Parenting sessions were
helpful for them in catalyzing and supporting healthy
lifestyle behavior change. The coordinator presents the
findings of the family health routine assessment using
the Feedback Form, which summarizes where families
are in the five areas of the assessment relative to age-
based norms with a stoplight color scheme. Family
strengths are represented in green, yellow indicates areas
to monitor, and red accentuates areas in need of further
support. The goals of this session are to (a) share assess-
ment findings with family members regarding strengths
and challenges, (b) engage in a motivation-enhancing
discussion about promoting positive changes, and (c)
provide a menu of resources and next steps for interven-
tion. The first two feedback sessions lay out a plan for
the follow-up services (i.e., Everyday Parenting sessions
or referrals to community-based services) and use MItechniques to increase buy-in for the planned course of
action. In the final feedback session (month 6), feedback
and motivation focus on the progress the family has
made and continuing engagement in community
services to address areas in need of additional support.
Everyday Parenting sessions
In the FCU4Health, Everyday Parenting sessions are
tailored to the family ’s specific needs identified in the
family health routine assessment and focus on a specific
behavior change goal, such as setting limits on snacking
between family meals or monitoring children ’s sedentary
and physical activity time. It is expected that families will
engage in 8 –16 sessions of Everyday Parenting over the
6-month intervention period. The focus is on supporting
and maintaining children ’s healthy behaviors. It is also
expected that during these sessions, the FCU4Health
coordinator will help the caregivers problem-solve
challenges they have encountered in implementing rec-
ommended health behavior changes.
Community programs and support services
To address needs related to heal th behaviors (e.g., nutrition
and physical activity programs ), specialty medical needs
(e.g., asthma, diabetes), and the social determinants of
health that affect parents ’ability to support child health
(e.g., employment, food and housing insecurity, insurance
coverage), coordinators provide families with referrals to
Fig. 2 CONSORT flow diagramSmith et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:11 Page 5 of 15
existing resources in the community. We will identify pro-
grams in collaboration with our partner agencies that are
available at little or no cost to families. The intent is to
leverage existing services to support families and to test
whether the motivational aspects of the FCU4Health lead
to increased engagement compared to families in usual
care. A centralized repository of available programs and
their requirements is stored in a Web-based hub, which
can be updated by coordinators and other staff.
Phone-based coaching
In weeks where a face-to-face session is not scheduled or
does not occur (e.g., cancelation, no show), the coordin-
ator or a behavioral health support staff person (e.g., a
community health worker) conducts a 15- to 30-min
phone-based coaching session. The purpose is to maintain
contact with the family and help problem-solve chal-
lenges, reinforce positive achievements, and continually
address motivation to change and barriers to engagement.
Additional information about the program is available in
the FCU4Health protocol manual [62].
Services-as-Usual Plus Information condition
Families randomized to the services-as-usual arm will
receive care as usual from their primary care provider
and any additional services offered by the agency, as well
as a listing of the same community resources offered to
families randomized to the FCU4Health arm.
Measures
Additional information on measures of implementation
and clinical effectiveness is presented in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively.
Implementation
To assess the acceptability ,feasibility ,appropriateness ,
and sustainability of each component of the FCU4-
Health (e.g., training, program costs, content, delivery),
an agency stakeholder battery will be electronically ad-
ministered to at least 30 agency stakeholders (approxi-
mately ten from each agency) at two times during the
study: 4 months into the FCU4Health delivery and when
all families enrolled in the study complete the entire 6-
month FCU4Health protocol. Families in the FCU4-
Health arm will rate the acceptability and appropriate-
ness of the program via an electronically administered
survey at months 6 and 12. Additionally, 20% of families
in the FCU4Health arm will be randomly selected and
interviewed by study staff via phone.
Study enrollment and participation data will be used
to evaluate the reach of the program in each agency
by tracking both the proportion of eligible families re-
ferred to the study and the number randomized to
the FCU4Health condition that engage in theprogram compared with the total number of eligible
families [63].
We will assess the fidelity of coordinators to the FCU4-
Health using an established observation rating system that
defines high-quality care and was associated with clinical
improvement in studies of the original FCU [53, 54]. A
trained coding team will code video or audio recordings of
the first FCU4Health feedback session from every family
(N= 200), and a subset of 80 families will be randomly
selected at study entry, balanced by coordinator, for longi-
tudinal coding of all three FCU4Health feedback sessions
to assess drift ( N= 160 additional sessio ns). In addition, we
will develop an automated coding system based on an exist-
ing, validated automated coding system for motivational
interviewing. Automated fidelity coding will be built from
previous methodologies developed for coding fidelity to MI
(presence of complex reflections, open-ended questions)
[56, 64, 65] and family interventions [66, 67]. Machine-
generated fidelity codes have been found to be reliable with
human coding across multiple studies [56, 64 –66, 68, 69].
Initial algorithm training will use existing FCU feedback
session recordings and the FCU fidelity codebook. Auto-
mated coding involves a computational “pipeline ”of both
speech signal processing and machine learning of the audio
recordings of the conversations during the sessions, includ-
ing (1) voice activity detection, (2) diarization (i.e., how
many speakers are in session and when is each talking?), (3)
role identification (i.e., who is the provider?), (4) automatic
speech-to-text transcription, and (5) machine learning
models to predict fidelity codes, using lexical (i.e., words)
and paralinguistic features as inputs.
Cost data collection is multi-method in order to per-
form analyses from multiple perspectives (e.g., agency,
payor, family). Study staff report activities weekly on an
electronically administered survey. FCU4Health coordi-
nators complete a brief survey after each contact with
study families (in the intervention arm) to capture the
staff involved and the number of hours spent. Elec-
tronic budgets track program spending and will be used
to prospectively separate costs associated with imple-
mentation from those specifically related to research
(e.g., participant reimbursement, data analysis soft-
ware), start-up (e.g., training), and ongoing costs (e.g.,
consultation with FCU4Health developers, technical as-
sistance, travel for home visitation). At each assess-
ment, families will be asked to provide a release for the
study team to obtain health plan claims data, which will
be used to identify relevant health services utilization
and associated costs.
Critical to the study ’s implementation aims, such as the
calculation of reach and cost, is the careful tracking of par-
ticipation in the various components of the program.
Using methods developed and tested in previous trials, the
FCU4Health coordinators and other agency staff will trackSmith et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:11 Page 6 of 15
all family contacts and record the delivery location,
travel time, details of participating family members,
the type of the FCU4Health session, content areas
covered, and referrals. At each assessment, caregiverswill report on their engagement in community re-
sources, how well these resources met their needs,
and the amount of time spent in activities to support
health child and family behaviors.Table 1 Implementation outcomes

Effectiveness
At each assessment, the child and caregiver(s) will be
weighed using a portable electronic scale. BMI is the pri-
mary study outcome because it indicates cardiometa-
bolic disease progression [70 –72]. However,
improvement in body composition in the absence of
weight loss can indicate a healthy change in the ratio of
fat to lean muscle, which often accompanies significant
changes in diet and physical activity and results in meta-
bolic improvement with enduring benefits [73, 74]. At
each assessment point, caregivers and children report on
health-promoting family behaviors ;mealtime, sleep, and
media routines ;child and family physical activity habits ;
child food and beverage choices ; and use of community
support services . The FITs are used for observational
assessment of parenting and family management skills
using the validated Coder Impressions Inventory [75]
(Dishion T, Hogansen J, Winter C, Jabson J. The coder im-
pressions inventory, unpublished manual). Although not
central to our aims, we will also assess several other con-
structs related to pediatric obesity: weight-related stigma ,
body image ,quality of life ,child behavioral and emotional
adjustment ,a n d caregiver satisfaction with services .
Data analysis
Overview
Analyses focus on implementation data from the families
randomized to the FCU4Health. Data from families receiv-
ing services as usual will be used in aims 2b and 3. Before
data analysis, we will test the ps ychometric properties (i.e.,
distribution, reliability) of t he measures, conduct a sequence
of nested multiple-group conf irmatory factor analyses [76]
to ensure measurement invariance across language and
ethnicity, and apply state-of-t he-science data reduction tech-
niques (confirmatory factor an alysis, weighted regression
scores) by creating multi-ind icator, multi-informant con-
struct variables when applica ble. These techniques improve
measurement properties and result in fewer contrasts,reducing type I error [77]. W e expect the attrition rate
across waves to be 10 –15% based on retention rates for local
studies with highly mobile, hard-to-track samples [78, 79].
We will adjust for missing data due to attrition using
multiple imputation [80] and full information maximum
likelihood [81]. We will perform sensitivity analyses to check
t h en o n - r e s p o n s em e c h a n i s m[ 8 2] and attrition analyses to
detect differential attritio n rates and attrition by group
interaction on sociodemograp hic and pretest variables that
m a yp o s eat h r e a tt ot h ev a l i d i t yo rt h ee q u i t yo ft h ef i n d i n g s
[83]. When missingness is not ignorable, we will use com-
plex models to obtain parameter estimates [84]. To estimate
power, we used Optimal Design [85] and Monte Carlo simu-
lations in Mplus [84] and referred to relevant publications.
All power analyses used 1 −β=. 8 0 a n d α=. 0 5 u s i n g t w o -
tailed tests. For mediation models, we applied simulation in
Mplus for estimating the power of path coefficients and re-
ferred to a work by Fritz and MacKinnon [86] for examining
significance of mediation effects.
For qualitative data analysis, stakeholder and care-
giver interviews and CAB discussions will be audio
recorded, transcribed, and then coded using a di-
rected content analysis approach [87] by using exist-
ing theory, prior results, and empirical frameworks to
develop a coding scheme. Codes will be refined using
a subsample of interviews, and then a team of trained
coders will code full transcripts. Twenty percent of
interviews will be double coded in order to calculate
reliability [88]. Disagreements in coding will be re-
solved via consensus.
Aim 1
Results of the adaptation activities are largely descriptive
and involve the use of qualitative data from the CAB
small group discussions to describe the process and
content of adaptations to the program during the course
of the trial.Table 2 Clinical effectiveness and related child and family outcomes (Continued)

(when applicable)
Satisfaction with care (1) Family Check-Up Caregiver Service Satisfaction Survey: 9 items rated on a 4-point scale
(0 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree) adapted from the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire
[135] to be specific to parent training programs. This was developed for use with the original
FCU conducted in community mental health clinics [ 89](α= .95) in that trialSurvey (CG)
(2) Parent Experience of Assessment Survey (PEAS) [ 136]: 3 of the 5 subscales
(parent –coordinator collaboration, systemic awareness, and negative feelings)
with 15 total items rated on a 5-point scale
(1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) ( α> .75)
Child adjustment Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [ 137]: caregivers and children rate 5 items each on a
3-point scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true, 4 = very true) on the conduct problems
(e.g., “I/[child name] often lose(s) temper ”), hyperactivity (e.g., “I am/[child name] is constantly
fidgeting or squirming ”), pro-social behavior (e.g., “I am/[child name] is considerate of other
people ’s feelings ”), and emotional problems (e.g., “I am/[child name] is often unhappy,
depressed, or sad ”) subscalesSurvey (CG, CH)

Aim 2
In addition to the specific outcomes in aims 2a –2c, we
will compare the two arms on stakeholder and caregiver
acceptability using repeated-measures analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) to analyze scores of approximately 30
stakeholders across two time points. We have sufficient
power to detect a medium effect for this analysis
(f≥.32). Concerning the variance of caregiver acceptabil-
ity ratings between groups or over time, we have
sufficient power to detect a medium effect ( f≥.28).
Latent growth curve (LGC) analyses will be used to
determine group differences in the trajectory over time.
The estimated power for this analysis is β= 0.12.
Aim 2a: fidelity
We will calculate the mean score, interrater correlation
coefficient, and internal consistency of the observational
ratings. Using a mixed-effects model with random
effects for families and a fixed-effects model, we will
compare scores from prior FCU trials [53 –55, 89]
(Smith JD, Dishion TJ, Rudo-Stern J, Stormshak EA,
Brown K, Ramos K, Thornton N, Shaw DS, Wilson MN,
, A quasi-experimental study of the sensitivity and effi-
ciency of observationally assessing fidelity, submitted) to
those from the current trial. We have power to detect a
small effect of d≥.18. Second, we will use the LGC ana-
lysis to (1) evaluate drift in fidelity [53] (power to detect
a small effect of d≥.16 for μslope) with the sample size of
80 families and 240 feedback sessions and (2) assess the
relation between variability in fidelity on program effects
(power to detect a small effect of β≥.10 for μslope on
outcomes). To evaluate fidelity using automated coding,
we will conduct the same analyses as above but with all
600 feedback sessions. Even when controlling for imper-
fect reliability, we have power to detect a small effect of
d≥.10 for comparison to previous trials, a small effect
ofd≥.11 for μslope, and a small effect of β≥.08 for μslope
on outcomes.
Aim 2b: costs
An ingredient-based cost analysis procedure will be
employed to estimate FCU4Health installation and con-
tinued implementation costs. Using an activity-based
costing approach will allow us to value activities both
locally and from national data sources (e.g., US Bureau
of Labor Statistics), providing estimates relevant for
scale-up in new pediatric care settings nationwide. First,
we will conduct a budget impact analysis (BIA) of the
cost to install the program (i.e., prior to enrollment and
provision of care). BIA provides an estimate of the finan-
cial consequences of adopting a new intervention from
the perspective of the entity financing the intervention
[90]. Second, a multi-perspective cost –benefit analysis
will be undertaken to capture the potential impact of theFCU4Health on different key stakeholders (i.e., payor,
hospital, family). The fiscal models will be structured to
estimate monetary benefits associated with program
effects. For significant program effects on the outcome
measures in aims 1 and 2, we will calculate the total
benefit as a function of the size of the effect ( Q) and the
price per unit ( P) for each year ( y). This value can be
simply represented as By=Qy×Py. Effects at 6 and
12 months will be adjusted using a discount rate to
accommodate the impact of time on our estimates. To
avoid overlap or double-counting benefits, we will
employ a weighted average approach of outcomes [91].
We will calculate the average based on the total effect
sizes for each outcome in order to estimate the benefits
from a single monetary source. While point estimates
often represent the bottom line for such an evaluation
(e.g., a return-on-investment amount), a confidence
interval that incorporates different values of model input
that might feasibly occur is more appropriate given the
various model assumptions used [92]. A common model
input that could take a range of values represents
economic uncertainty (i.e., the discounting rate) [93]. In
addition to representing the variation that might be
expected due to sampling, we will also consider a range
of estimates due to anticipated variation in program
characteristics. We will consider how key aspects of the
delivery system, such as facility costs or provider salary,
might vary with new installations.
Aim 2c: sustainability
The sustainability plan will be largely descriptive and
involve the synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data
across implementation outcomes, caregiver satisfaction
survey results, and CAB guidance. We will use a mixed-
methods data analytic approach (QUANT = QUAL) [94]
to develop the sustainability plan.
Aim 3
We will apply intent-to-treat analyses, using data from
all participants who are randomly assigned to the two
arms. Our unbalanced design (200 FCU4Health, 150
services-as-usual) only slightly affects statistical power
[95]. The primary outcomes are the distal effects on
child weight status and body composition and effects on
more proximal mediators, including healthy lifestyle
(dietary and physical activity habits), child self-
regulation, parenting variables, and use of community
support services. The LGC analysis for the continuous
BMI and body composition measures will be used to
compare the trajectories of the two conditions over time
analyzed with random-effects models [96]. Specifically,
we will estimate whether individual changes (i.e., growth
trajectories) over time vary from person to person and
whether inter-individual variation is systematicallySmith et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:11 Page 10 of 15
related to intervention assignment. For comparing
FCU4Health and control arms using analysis of covari-
ance (ANCOVA), we have power to detect a mean
difference with a small-to-medium effect size ( d≥.25;
odds ratio ≥1.5, assuming the base rate of the control
group is 30%). This means we have power to detect the
size of effect on BMI found in previous trials with
children and early adolescents, which varies significantly
from small to medium (range: d= .20 –.40) across inter-
vention types [97 –100] but is large ( d≥.50) for family-
centered behavioral programs [101, 102]. For the growth
models (repeated-measures analysis using three or four
data points), we have power to detect a small effect on
the trajectory ( β= .12 or η2≤2%). LGC modeling has
better power than the two-time point ANCOVA for
detecting treatment effects in a randomized design
[103]. Second, we will examine whether program effects
on the distal outcomes are transmitted through the pro-
gram effects on the proximal variables using mediation
analyses, controlling for baseline measures of the mediator
and outcome. Bootstrapping will be used to form confi-
dence intervals to test for mediation effects, which has
been shown to have better power [86, 104]. We have
power to detect a mediated effect if the two paths each
have a small-to-medium effect ( βvalues ≥.14).
Baseline weight, ecological risk, minority status, pov-
erty status, and child gender will be included as covari-
ates and tested as potential moderators. Moderation of
program effects will be examined by adding a program
by moderator interaction in the models of primary out-
comes and mediators one at a time. For significant inter-
actions, post hoc probing of simple effects (i.e., effects at
different values of the moderator) will be conducted,
following Aiken and West [105]. Accounting for the
imperfect reliability, we have power to detect moderation
effects that account for R2≤3% of the outcome [106].
We will examine whether it is necessary to account for
site and coordinator effects by calculating the design
effect metric [107]. If significant, we will modify our
statistical plans and utilize multi-level models with site
or coordinator as the cluster variable.
Aim 4
To determine differences in family participation between
conditions, we will use the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
We have sufficient power to detect a medium effect for
this analysis ( f≥.30). Next, we will use path analysis in
structural equation modeling to test a model of program
implementation where family engagement mediates the
relation between fidelity and clinical outcomes [58].
Using automated fidelity data on the FCU4Health condi-
tion sample ( N= 200), we have power to detect a medi-
ated effect if the two paths each has a small-to-medium
effect ( βvalues ≥.21).Study status
At the time this manuscript was submitted for publica-
tion, the study was underway. We are planning for our
fourth CAB meeting; initial adaptation of the program
and assessment is complete; interviewers, coordinators,
and other program staff have been trained; and recruit-
ment is in progress at all three agencies. We have also
begun formative work on the development of the auto-
mated fidelity coding system using data from previous
FCU trials.
Discussion
Similar to some previously published study protocols in
this journal, our type II hybrid effectiveness –implemen-
tation trial blends pragmatic trial and implementation
science frameworks. However, our protocol is somewhat
unique to the hybrid trial design described by Curran et
al. [46] because the two implementation strategies differ
on the pragmatic –explanatory trial continuum [108] in
which the integrated/co-located care arm of the trial is
more pragmatic compared to the coordinated care with
referral condition, which is more explanatory. However,
both conditions are far more pragmatic than they are
explanatory —as would be expected for a hybrid trial.
This was done to speed translation given that the effect-
iveness of the adapted FCU4Health program was par-
tially supported by the large existing corpus of evidence
supporting the original FCU to both change the pur-
ported mediators as well as the primary child outcomes
[44]. Additionally, the request for applications for the
Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration Projects 2.0
indicated preference for such a design [109].
One of the primary challenges we have encountered
since beginning this study relates to working with health-
care organizations. Context is always critical to implemen-
tation research, and differences are magnified when
attempting to implement a complex behavioral interven-
tion where, previously, a similar program did not exist.
The partnerships between the research team and the com-
munity sites are critical for success [110], and we have
been able to remain successful due to the strength of our
partnership, but administrative, personnel, and other
issues required extensive meetings, which protracted our
planned preparation time from 6 months to nearly
12 months. Many of the issues that were raised could not
have been avoided. In part, the extended time was due to
variation within our partner clinics that necessitated meet-
ings as well as continually garnering buy-in from leader-
ship and staff that would deliver the FCU4Health.
In conclusion, this study was designed to address a
larger issue in the field of pediatric obesity manage-
ment —the lack of penetration of evidence-based pro-
grams into the primary healthcare system. The B rating
for family-centered weight management interventionsSmith et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:11 Page 11 of 15
for children aged 6 to 12 years with overweight and
obesity by the US Preventive Services Task Force [111]
provided a financial avenue for such interventions in
primary care. This study was aimed at testing and evalu-
ating the many factors that comprise the struggle of
making a complex, evidence-based program work in the
real world [112]. Achieving wide-scale adoption of the
FCU4Health, if found to be effective, would impact the
pediatric obesity epidemic in a way that could simultan-
eously address a number of the factors that result in
healthcare disparities for chronic conditions.
