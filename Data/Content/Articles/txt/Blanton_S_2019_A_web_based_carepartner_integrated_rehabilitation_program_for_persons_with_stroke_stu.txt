Abstract
Background: Family carepartner management and support can improve stroke survivor recovery, yet research has
placed little emphasis on how to integrate families into the reha bilitation process without increasing negative carepartner
outcomes. Our group has developed creativ e approaches for engaging family carepar tners in rehabilitation activities to
improve physical and psychosocial health for both the carepartner and stroke survivor. The purpose of this study is to
explore a novel, web-based intervention ( Carepartner and Constraint-Induced Therapy; CARE-CITE) designed to facilitate
positive carepartner involvement during a home-based applic ation of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for
the upper extremity.
Methods: The primary aim of the study is to determine feasibility of CARE-CITE for both stroke survivors and their
carepartners. Carepartner mental health , family conflict surrounding stroke reco very, and stroke survivor upper extremity
function will be evaluated using an eval uator blinded, two-group experimental design (blocked randomization protocol
according to a 2:1 randomization schema) with 32 intervention dyads and 16 control dyads (who will receive CIMT
without structured carepartner involv ement). CARE-CITE consists of online education modules for the carepartner to
review in parallel to the 30-h CIMT that t he stroke survivor receives. The intent of CARE-CITE is to enhance the home-
based intervention of CIMT, by helping the carepartner support the therapy and create a therapeutic home environment
encouraging practice of the weaker arm in functional tasks.
Discussion: The CARE-CITE study is testing the feasibility of a famil y-integrated rehabilitation approach applied in the
home environment, and results will provide the foundation for larger clinical studies. The overall significance of this
research plan is to increase the underst anding and further development of int erventions that may serve as models to
promote family involvement in the rehabilitation process.

Background
Approximately 4.8 million stroke survivors (SS) require
assistance from family members who are often untrained
and ill prepared for the burdens associated with stroke
rehabilitation [ 1,2]. Family carepartners (CPs) are key
contributors to stroke recovery, but their efforts can lead
to a high level of CP burden and depressive symptoms,
reduced quality of life (QOL), and increased stress sur-
rounding the recovery process [ 3–7]. Recent reductions
in reimbursement for rehabilitation services and shrink-
ing healthcare resources are creating mounting burdens
on the family unit and shifting more of the demand for
care to the home [ 8]. With carepartner well-being affect-
ing health outcomes in both individuals (CP and SS),
identifying strategies to effectively support CPs during
rehabilitation without contributing to their own burden
is a critical need. Creasy et al. [ 9] evaluated the impact
of healthcare provider interactions on CP needs during
rehabilitation and found that CPs overwhelmingly em-
phasized the importance of being involved in treatment
planning and expressed expectations to have information
and rehabilitation training tailored to family needs [ 10].
Several studies have shown that improving CP coping and
life skills surrounding caring for a chronically ill family
member benefits the CP leading to a decrease in measures
of depression and caregiver burden and improved QOL
[5,11,12]. However, to date, a family-focused approach in
rehabilitation therapy that addresses CP needs has not
been evaluated in stroke research.
Combining findings from rehabilitation therapy and
nursing research, we have developed a theory-based
intervention —Carepartner and Constraint- Induced
Therapy (CARE-CITE) —designed to enhance the thera-
peutic process by positively engaging CPs during
evidence-based SS upper extremity (UE) functional task
practice in the home setting [ 13]. A well-established and
structured therapy intervention, constraint-induced
movement therapy (CIMT) involves intensive repetitive
task practice of the weaker limb combined with restriction
of the stronger limb (using a mitt) and has been shown to
improve UE function and promote neuroplasticity [ 14,15].
While effective, CIMT can also be demanding on the SS
and family members [ 16], frequently requiring additional
t i m ea n da s s i s t a n c ef o rt h eS St oc o m p l e t ef u n c t i o n a lt a s k s
and motivational support from the CP. To address this
need, CARE-CITE guides the CP in collaborative goal set-
ting and providing autonomy su pport (characterized by em-
pathy, choice and reducing use of controlling language) for
the SS to promote motivation and creative problem-solving
in UE self-management. The theoretical mechanisms of
CARE-CITE are rooted in Self-Determination Theory [ 17]
that fosters individual autonomy and confidence resulting
in better adherence to self-managed health behaviors. Aut
onomy-supportive language in task instruction influencesmotor skill acquisition and self-efficacy in the SS, and is a
key ingredient in current motor learning theory in stroke
rehabilitation [ 18]. Although highly applicable to post-
stroke motor rehabilitation [ 18], rehabilitation clinical trials
rarely incorporate training designed to support self-man-
agement in therapy despite recommendations that this type
of behavioral intervention may improve long-term out-
comes and enhance motor learning [ 19].
We initially tested a workbook version of the CARE-CITE
intervention in the outpatien t rehabilitation clinic using a
one-group, quasi-experimental design study with 7 CP and
SS dyads (SS were > 9 month post-stroke) [ 20]. SS with
mild to moderate UE deficits (ability to initiate active wrist
and finger extension) underwe nt 30 h (10 3-hour sessions)
of CIMT while the CP followed an instructional workbook
and attended specific CIMT sessions. This initial version of
CARE-CITE was feasible as evidenced by high dyad adher-
ence and completion rates (100%) and a high CP-reported
v a l u eo fC A R E - C I T Ei nt h ep o s t - s t u d ye x i ti n t e r v i e w .I m -
provements were seen in CP depressive symptoms and
family conflict surrounding stroke recovery and in UE func-
tional tasks for the SS. At exit interviews, CPs rated their
participation as worthwhile and believed that their involve-
ment contributed to their SSs ’success. However, they also
stated that travel barriers an d time demands associated with
attending sessions in the clinic were an additional chal-
lenge. In response to this feedback, we revised the interven-
tion and developed a digital format of CARE-CITE that can
be accessed via a portable electronic device with web-ac-
cess, such as a tablet or laptop. In collaboration with fam-
ilies, we created exemplary and interactive videos of actual
CPs working with SS in activities of daily living to model
intervention concepts in a real-world context. Content val-
idity and CP satisfaction with this revised format has been
tested to assess feasibility prior to enrollment of the current
study [ 13]. Rehabilitation experts evaluated the website
content for accuracy, feasibilit y, acceptability, problem rele-
vance, and ease of use. CPs ( n= 6) rated the content for
usefulness, ease of use, acceptability, and time to complete

= 4) rated each module as accurate (4.95), feasible (4.8),
easy to use (4.86), acceptable (4.96), and appropriate prob-
lem relevance (4.65). On average, all CPs agreed or strongly
agreed that the modules were useful (4.42), easy to use (4.6)
and acceptable (4.41) and the video content was described
as“excellent ”and consistently noted as “helpful to under-
stand the information ”in each module.
The aim of this paper is to describe the CARE-CITE
(NICHD K23 1k23HD080837) pilot study design. The
primary objective of this trial is to evaluate feasibility of
a web-based, family-focused intervention for stroke
survivors and their carepartners. To explore feasibility of
CARE-CITE, we will assess participant recruitment andBlanton et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:58 Page 2 of 11
retention, SS and CP adherence to the intervention, CP
usability and satisfaction with the CARE-CITE, and occur-
rence of SS adverse events. The secondary objective of the
study is to collect preliminary data indicative of the potential
impact of CARE-CITE on CP depressive symptoms, family
conflict related to stroke recovery, and SS UE function, with
a view toward the design of a larger future trial. To gain in-
sights into potential mechanisms of CARE-CITE, additional
preliminary data will be collected on CP self-efficacy, strain,
fatigue, general family functioning and SS memory and be-
havior problems, SS depressive symptoms, and quality of life.
Methods
Identification and reporting of relevant elements of this
protocol are based on the Standard Protocol Items: Rec-
ommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) checklist
[21] and Template for Intervention Description and Repli-
cation (TIDieR) guidelines for intervention descriptions
[22]. This is the first published version of this protocol
(November 17, 2018).
Approvals
Ethical approval was obtained by Emory University Insti-
tutional Review Board and this protocol is registered on
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02703532).
Study Design & Setting
This design is an evaluator blinded, randomized, two
group controlled trial with evaluations for the dyad (32
intervention, 16 control) at baseline, immediately
post-intervention and at 1-month follow-up. The site for
the participant recruitment, screening, evaluations, and
personnel training is a stroke research laboratory within
a large 56-bed urban rehabilitation hospital located in
Atlanta, GA, US. The principal investigator (PI, first au-
thor) will perform all participant screening. Licensed
physical and occupational therapists will conduct the
evaluations and administer the home-based CIMT inter-
vention. Participants will be randomly allocated to either
CIMT combined with CARE-CITE intervention or
CIMT alone. The web-based CARE-CITE intervention
will be accessed on-line by CPs randomized to the inter-
vention group, independent of therapist involvement.
Recruitment
Participants
Forty-eight stroke survivor and carepartner dyads will be
recruited for this study. Both CP and SS must be greater
than 18 years of age, able to read and write English and
able to provide informed consent. Inclusion criteria for
the SS include:
/C15One month to 2 years post-ischemic or hemorrhagic
event/C15Minimal to moderate upper extremity deficits
(ability to initiate wrist and finger extension)
/C15Presence of CP
Exclusion criteria for SS include:
/C15Severe cognitive deficits (as indicated by mini-mental
test > 24)
/C15Concurrent participation in other rehabilitation
research trials
/C15Concurrent traditional outpatient therapy for the
upper extremity during treatment phase of study
/C15Major medical issues limiting participation in a
rehabilitation program or having another
neurological disease like Parkinson ’s disease or
multiple sclerosis
/C15Upper extremity pain during functional tasks that
may be aggravated by intensive CIMT protocol or
limit treatment participation
During the in-person screening phase, participants will
be asked about receiving anti-spasticity medications. Oral
agents such as dantrolene sodium are allowed, if main-
tained at consistent dosage. Participants are not allowed to
enroll until 3 months after any BOTOX® therapy injections.
CPs will be defined as those individuals who are a
spouse/partner or family member dwelling in the same
household and self-identified as the primary caregiver of
the stroke survivor. Inclusion criteria include willingness
to support SS in therapy roles and no significant cognitive
deficits as evident by their ability to explain the general
purpose of the study and their role as a CP participant to
the PI after reviewing the informed consent.
Recruitment and retention strategies
Potential participants will be identified by study staff
through bi-weekly monitoring of inpatient and outpatient
stroke census of the rehabilitation hospital and reviewing
electronic medical records for patients that may meet eligi-
bility criteria based on occup ational and physical therapy
documentation. The primary tr eating rehabilitation thera-
pists of potentially eligible individuals will be contacted to
discuss recommendations for plan of care and appropriate-
ness for inclusion. Additionally, the PI will provide in-ser-
vices to other regional hospita ls and clinics and community
stroke support groups and distribute informational bro-
chures. Interested potential participants will be screened for
eligibility by the PI and will start the study as soon as re-
cruited. Targeted enrollment will be two dyads per month.
To maintain participants in the study, the study PI and
study staff will be available to respond promptly to any
communication or issue through email and phone and will
provide reminder calls and texts to confirm treatment andBlanton et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:58 Page 3 of 11
evaluation appointments. A ll dyads will receive $100 for
study participation.
Sample size estimation
Formal sample size calculations are not appropriate for
pilot studies [ 23]. This pilot study will provide important
estimates of within-subject and between-subject variabil-
ity for outcome variables, which will be used to power
future full-scale clinical studies. We will focus on the
magnitude of the differences for each outcome,
consistency of findings, and clinical significance. Julious
[24] recommended a sample size of 12 subjects per
group as adequate for a pilot study in the context of
estimation based on the 95% confidence interval for the
mean difference (i.e., the precision about the mean
difference as assessed by its 95% confidence interval).
He indicated that even a sample size of 12 subjects per
group provides useful data about the mean difference
and standard deviation for an outcome that is roughly
normally distributed. Given this, along with feasibility
considerations, we plan to recruit 16 dyads into the
CIMT-only control group and 32 dyads into the CARE-
CITE group. The larger intervention group will contrib-
ute precision to the pilot-based estimates of mean
changes and variability for key outcomes, while also
improving the lessons to be learned about feasibility to
inform future implementation for a larger-scale trial.Randomization
Study participants will be randomized (blocked
randomization protocol) according to a 2:1 randomization
schema —32 intervention dyads and 16 control dyads (who
will receive CIMT without structured carepartner involve-
ment).Using this type of randomization schema will allow
for a larger intervention group for assessment of feasibility.
Previous studies conducted by this lab have established an
expected recruitment rate of approximately 2 –3d y a d s /
month, allowing adequate time to meet target enrollment
of 48 dyads during the propos e ds t u d yt i m ep e r i o d .T h i s
approach offers the opportunity to gather more information
on the intervention effects and effect size for future work
while still adhering to projected recruitment rates. The
blocked randomization protocol will be developed by the
study statistician who will cr eate sealed envelopes contain-
ing group assignment with se quential dyad numbering
(CP1, CP2, etc.) prior to study initiation. Once the dyad
completes the baseline evalua tion, the sealed envelope will
be opened by the PI (unblinding to treatment group alloca-
tion), who will inform the CP of allocation.
Intervention
CARE-CITE intervention
Dyads in the experimental group will receive CIMT with
CP involvement (CARE-CITE). The CARE-CITE interven-
tion consists of web-based, interactive educational modules
(Table 1) for the CP to review during the 4 –6-week period
Table 1 Content of the CARE-CITE Intervention for the carepartner
Modules Content
Overview of Modules Structure Each module has the purpose, information in text format and video clips to provide additional detail and/or
illustrate examples of behavior discussed. At the end of each module are 4 –5 reflection questions to allow
for application of content and 7 questions to obtain feedback on ease of use, acceptability and usefulness
of modules.
Module I: Welcome to CARE-CITE Description of the CARE-CITE project, overall summary of the modules and intent. Welcome survey for CP to
fill out with the research interventionist to practice using website and completing questionnaires. One video
clip with introductory information.
Module II: Introduction to Concepts
and Applications of CIMTOverview of CIMT, including behavior contract (CP and individual with stroke determine activities when mitt
worn and taken off) and home diary (to record activities/time wearing mitt).
Four video clips with information about wearing the mitt, behavior contract, home diary, and committing
to practice.
Module III: Practice and Goal
SettingReview of role of practice in driving neuroplasticity and recovery after stroke. Discussion of challenge threshold,
making mistakes while learning new skills. Guidance provided for problem solving to adapt functional activities
at home, both reducing complexity when a task was too difficult and increasing challenge when the task was
easily mastered. Two to three brief video clips for each of six themes of practice.
Module IV: Autonomy Support –
Creating PartnershipsCreating an Autonomy-Supportive Environment –How to be empathic, problem solve in performing tasks in
the home setting, use non-controlling language and offer choice. Examples include suggesting CP wear mitt on
non-dominant hand while trying tasks and offering alternative activities when individual with stroke becomes
frustrated during a challenging task. Recognizing challenges and exploring ways to improve communication
(avoid controlling language such as “you should exercise ”,“you have to do this ”). Seven video clips illustrating
understanding another ’s viewpoint, problem-solving strategies, providing rationale and providing choice.
Module V: Taking Care of Yourself
as a CarepartnerCP self-care –recognizing demands of caregiving role, strategies for stress reduction, opportunities for self-care
activities and community resources. (no videos)
Module VI: Reflections Three videos (limited text) of stroke survivors reflecting on rehabilitation and recovery. Encouraging CP
reflection on his/her role in recovery of the individual with stroke.

of time the SS undergoes ten, 3-h sessions of home-based

home-based application of CIMT by guiding the CP in ef-
fective strategies that facilit ate and encourage the SS to use

review the 6 online modules on their own time. The theor-
etical framework for the intervention is the concept of au-
tonomy support, with text an d video that demonstrate ways
to encourage empathy (video examples of discussions of CP
with SS acknowledging difficulty of task), collaborating on
problem-solving (examples of methods to increase or de-
crease difficulty of activities t ogether), emphasizing import-
ance of offering SS choice in activities to practice (examples
of joint goal-setting) and ways to provide non-controlling
language (scenarios showing controlling vs. non-controlling
language). At the end of each module, the CP is asked to
complete 4 –6 self-reflection questions that help integrate
the educational content into th eir own lives and activities
with the SS. These responses indicate the CP has com-
pleted the module and will be sent electronically in real
time to the study PI to monitor adherence (see the “Feasi-
bility ”section) and progression through the modules and
identify any technical problems that may occur.
For both groups, the CIMT sessions focus on functional
task practice of the upper extremity. The SS chooses tasks
and the practice session schedule. During the first CIMT
session, the SS will be introduced to the approach of
CIMT, and how and when to safely use the mitt on the
stronger hand. This information will be conveyed through
a behavioral contract that will document specific activities
for which the mitt should (and should not) be worn. The
SS will be encouraged to wear the mitt as much as pos-
sible during waking hours with a goal of 5 h/day during
the entire treatment period. To document activities
attempted with the weaker hand and create opportunities
for collaborative problem-solving with the therapist, the
SS completes a home diary. In addition to providing infor-
mation regarding SS adherence to wearing the mitt, the
diary offers an opportunity for the SS and therapist to
identify and discuss challenges and difficulties that might
be experienced outside of therapy sessions. Graded and
progressive task practice will address overall upper ex-
tremity function, strength, range of motion, and fine
motor dexterity. Recommendations for functional activity
practice between sessions to address SS movement im-
pairments will be based on the SS (and CP in CARE-CITE
group) goals, (e.g., to increase functional grasp, reaching
and release, practice loading and unloading dishwasher,
progressing to heavier items as tolerated). Each therapy
session will begin with check of vitals, and questions
assessing any pain, fatigue, and incidence of falls or
medical visits. The therapist will review the home diary
and discuss any successes or challenges encountered since
the last visit. The SS will then be asked to identify tasks tobe practiced during the session and order of practice.
After the completion of the final CIMT session the mitt
use will be discontinued, but the SS will be encouraged to
continue progressing with functional tasks and goals.
Control group
In the control group, the SS will receive the same
CIMT intervention as the experimental group. Al-
though the CP may be in the home when the stroke
survivor receives therapy, the CP will not receive any
materials about how to engage with the SS other than
review of safety considerations when the SS is wear-
ing the mitt.
Standardization
For the CARE-CITE intervention group, the study PI (pri-
mary author) will instruct all CPs in the use of the
CARE-CITE modules, monitor adherence to intervention,
and download data from module reflection and feedback
questions. CIMT will be deliver ed by licensed occupational
and physical therapists who will not have access to the CP
modules/CARE-CITE content. The study PI will monitor
training, standardization, and delivery of CIMT through
weekly check-ins with each th erapist via email and phone
communication and will train and standardize the study
evaluator. All efforts will be made to use one evaluator for
all study evaluations (primarily within each dyad) to reduce
variability. Data collection forms will be standardized for
evaluators and intervention therapists to facilitate protocol
adherence.
Outcomes
Data collection for SS and CP will be completed at a re-
habilitation hospital stroke laboratory in separate rooms
by the evaluator, blinded to group assignment, study hy-
potheses, and CARE-CITE intervention. Outcomes will
be measured at baseline, within 1 week of completion of
CIMT treatment and at 1 month follow-up.
Outcomes for Carepartner and stroke survivor
Primary outcome measures for the CP are depressive
symptoms and family conflict surrounding stroke recov-
ery and upper extremity function for the SS. These mea-
sures have been tested in this population previously.
Additional exploratory measures will be collected to gain
insights into possible mechanisms of CARE-CITE and
include CP self-efficacy, strain, fatigue, well-being
related to caregiving, general family functioning and
stroke survivor ’s memory and behavior problems,
depressive symptoms, UE self-efficacy, and quality of
life. Table 2lists primary outcome measures, process
variables and usability measures, descriptions, and
established reliability and validity.Blanton et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:58 Page 5 of 11
Additional assessments
Participant characteristics will be gathered from med-
ical records (for SS) and baseline information question-
naires (SS and CP). For both CP and SS, information
includes demographics (age, gender), marital status,
education level, income, work status, any changes inwork since stroke, co-morbidities, and current medica-
tions. Specific information for the SS includes type of
stroke, time post-stroke, and hand dominance and for
CP, relationship to SS and status of serving as caregiver
for other members of family beside SS. Because the
CARE-CITE intervention is web-based, we will alsoTable 2 Outcome measures collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 1 month follow-up

Feasibility
To assess feasibility of CARE-CITE, we will assess partici-
pant recruitment and retention, SS and CP adherence to
the intervention, occurrence of SS adverse events, and CP
perceptions of usability and satisfaction with CARE-CITE .
Recruitment rates will be calculated based on the percent-
age of those participants enrolled and randomized from
those screened. Recruitment will be deemed feasible if the
target enrollment of 48 dyads (2 –3 dyads per month) is
reached during the study timeframe. Retention of partici-
pants will be tracked, recording the percentage of dropouts
from each group. An acceptable retention rate will be 85%
of enrolled participants for completion of post-evaluation
(80% for one-month follow-up).
Adherence to intervention for SS will be measured by
number of CIMT sessions attended (10 total sessions)
and total hours (30 h) of training completed. Criteria for
adherence completion of CIMT will be a minimum of
27 h. Minimal percentage of target adherence rate for
feasibility is 85% of enrolled SS completing CIMT. Re-
view of the SS home diary will provide data on daily and
overall mitt wearing during the treatment as well as
functional activities attempted. CP adherence will be
measured by number of modules reviewed (6 total mod-
ules) as indicated by questions completed at the end of
each section. Criteria for adherence completion of
CARE-CITE will be a minimum completion of 5 of the
6 modules. Minimal percentage of target adherence rate
for feasibility is 85% of CP in the CARE-CITE group
completing modules. Based on work by Bakas and col-
leagues [ 48], adapted questions will be used to evaluate
CP usability and satisfaction of CARE-CITE. At the end
of each of the six modules, CP will be instructed to
complete these questions immediately after reviewing a
module. Satisfaction will be defined as (1) usefulness of
overall content, (2) usefulness of written text, (3) useful-
ness of videos, (4) ease of use, and (5) acceptability. Each
area will be rated using a 5-point Likert type response
scale ranging from 1=strongly disagree to5=strongly
agree and average scores calculated for each subscale as
well as a total score. CP will record time (minutes) to
complete each module and these averages will be summed
to obtain total time to review all modules. To supplement
this data, one open-ended question will be used for general
comments or improvement suggestions. The Post-Study
System Usability Questionnaire [ 47] will be administered to
experimental group CPs at the p ost-treatment evaluation to
gather additional data on CARE-CITE usability [ 46]. At the
1-month post-evaluation, the CP ’s perceptions of the inter-
vention will be gathered through a three-section CP exit
interview administered by the study PI in a private room.Section A has 15 items, with a response scale of 0 –100 (0 —
very uncertain to 100 —very certain), and addresses confi-
dence in care, with sample questions such as “How
confident are you that you can encourage your loved-one
when she/he is frustrated with a task? ”Section B has 5
items about value of participation in the study, such as
“Given the time commitment and effort for you to take part
in the education project and its effect on your ability to
help your loved one, how worthw hile has the participation
in the education project been to you personally? ”with a re-
sponse scale of 1 –7( i . e . ,1 —not worthwhile to 7 —very
worthwhile) and two open-ended questions. Section C
assesses aspects of helpfulness for the intervention such as
“Given your experience with the education project, how
helpful do you feel each of the following aspects was for
achieving results in your particular case? ”(Being able to
view intervention from your home; homework activities be-
tween sessions, format of using CARE-CITE website) with
ar e s p o n s es c a l eo f1 –7( i . e . ,1 —not helpful at all to 7 —very
helpful). CPs will be asked to provide additional feedback
about helpful areas of the intervention and areas for
improvement through two additional open-ended
questions. Modeled after others used in research [ 43], this
investigator-developed exit interview was reviewed by
experts in caregiving and stroke for content validity.
Harms
For the SS, adverse events will be monitored at each
home-based treatment session by intervention therapists
delivering the CIMT and they will report to the study PI
if any adverse event occurs. Although no significant risks
have been associated with the administration of upper
limb task practice in the home, the primary risks involve
fatigue or frustration when attempting challenging tasks
with the weaker limb and falls in those individuals with
balance impairments. At each training session, the therap-
ist will ask the SS questions related to levels of pain, fa-
tigue, and any incidence of falls or medical appointments
since the previous session. A behavior contract will be
reviewed with the patient to identify any tasks in which
safety is a concern or that should be avoided when the car-
epartner is not present. These guidelines are individually
tailored to the participant and the carepartner is involved
in the process. Risks to CPs are minimal because this inter-
vention is psychoeducational. Because we will be adminis-
tering a questionnaire to CPs that has a cut-off score that
indicates possible depression, we will notify CPs who score
above the established cut-off of 16 on the CES-D that their
response indicates they may need an evaluation for depres-
sion. We will recommend that they contact their primary
health care provider for a referral. If they do not know of
someone, we will provide resources for their consideration.
The consent form will contain a statement explaining this
process. All adverse events wi ll be reported, documented,Blanton et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:58 Page 7 of 11
and categorized as serious (deat h, life-threatening or related
inpatient hospitalization) or non-serious; anticipated or un-
anticipated; related, potentia lly related or non-related to the
intervention as defined by the local institutional review
board. Date of onset, action taken, outcome, and any
changes in procedures/treat ment will be noted. Due to the
low risk involved in the study for CP and SS, there will be
no Data Safety and Monitoring Board, and all serious ad-
v e r s ee v e n t sw i l lb er e v i e w e db yt h es t u d yt e a m( S B ,P C ,
SD) to determine whether safety problems would warrant
termination of the trial.
Study procedures
Figure 1depicts the study design. Before study participa-
tion, participant eligibility will be confirmed via phone
screen, chart review and initial clinical evaluation and
physician consent. Enrollment will be defined as the
review and signing of the informed consent document
by the participant and study PI, just prior to baselineevaluation. Immediately following baseline testing, study
participants will be randomized by the PI, who will in-
form the CP of allocation and provide information re-
garding accessing CIMT modules for the intervention
group.
SSs will start the home-based CIMT within a week of
randomization and continue for 4 –6 weeks until full
dosage (total of 30 h) of CIMT is administered. Out-
comes will be measured at baseline, within 1 week of
completion of CIMT treatment (post-test) and 1 month
(after post-test) follow-up.
Data management and analysis
All quantitative data storage will be maintained through
REDCap electronic database. REDCap (Research Electronic
Data Capture) [ 49] is a secure (compliant with US health-
care confidentiality legislati on requirements), web-based
application designed to sup port data capture for research
studies, providing (1) an intuitive interface for validated
data entry, (2) audit trails fo r tracking data manipulation
and export procedures, (3) automated export procedures
for seamless data downloads to common statistical pack-
ages, and (4) procedures for importing data from external
sources. REDCap data entry is completed by trained
research assistants. To minimize data entry errors, all data
are double checked for verification by a second research
assistant.
Standard data cleaning, identification of missing data,
and internal consistency reliability for standardized
scales will be completed. All quantitative statistical ana-
lyses will be performed using SAS statistics for Windows
(Version 9.4). Descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies,
means, ranges, standard deviations) will be examined for
all relevant variables for summarization, as well as to
identify unusual or suspect values requiring review and
confirmation. Initial data analysis will also include de-
scriptive statistics on feasibility measures of recruitment
rate, retention, CP usability, and satisfaction with CARE-
CITE (described under the “Feasibility ”section). To aid
in establishing estimates of variability useful for postulat-
ing effect sizes when designing larger follow-up studies,
mean and median changes from baseline to 1 month and
standard errors of the means within each group (control
and CARE-CITE intervention) will be examined and
reported. Confidence intervals for the difference in mean
changes for major study variables between the CARE-
CITE intervention and control groups will be reported
as descriptive statistics in order to provide preliminary
information about possible intervention effects based on
the pilot study. These major study variables include car-
epartner depression (CES-D), family conflict surround-
ing stroke recovery (FCCS), autonomy support (FCCQ-P
and FCCQ-F), and stroke survivor upper extremity func-
tion (WMFT and MAL). Estimates of inter-correlationsFig. 1 Consort flow chart: evaluation of a carepartner-integrated

among the study variables, including dyadic variables
that could influence response to the intervention, will be
summarized as additional information potentially helpful
toward the design of future studies. The biological vari-
ables of CP age, sex, gender and relationship of CP to SS
(e.g., spouse, adult child) and other participant charac-
teristics such as SS other health problems will be exam-
ined and potential relationships explored to gain insight
into possible confounding factors.
Auditing
Authorized representatives of NIH, regulatory agencies,
and the Institutional Review Board will be permitted to
review all research records to monitor study safety, pro-
gress, and procedures for quality assurance at any time.
Dissemination
Results of the study will be shared through peer-reviewed
manuscripts and conference presentations. The proposed
dissemination plan will be re fined through meetings with
study leadership, and authorship guidelines will be reviewed
with all study personnel. The PI will arrange follow-up pre-
sentations with community stroke groups and therapy
clinics involved in study re cruitment communications.
Discussion
While evidence supports the importance of addressing CP
needs, no studies have systematically integrated a CP inter-
vention (directed toward promoting an autonomy-support-
ive environment) with a rehabi litation therapy approach.
This protocol details the methodology to evaluate the
CARE-CITE intervention designed to enhance the thera-
peutic process by facilitating CP involvement and providing
education about stroke recovery. The results of this pilot
RCT will inform the development of a larger clinical trial to
test the efficacy of CARE-CITE by gaining preliminary esti-
mates of efficacy and components of variability associated
with CARE-CITE in chronic stroke. Additionally, informa-
tion from this study will assist in determining appropriate-
ness of outcome measures, evaluating treatment adherence
for SS and CP , monitoring incidence of severe adverse
events, measuring recruitment rates, and gaining informa-
tion to inform power calculations for the RCT sample size.
Potential limitations may be encountered. For example,
while CP of any sex/gender will be recruited, most CPs are
female and this may limit inter pretations of any sex/gender
differences found.
This family-centered intervention is a key advance-
ment, moving the rehabilitation field toward stroke care
that effectively addresses both survivor and CP needs in
tandem. Results of this area of research have the poten-
tial to guide the integration of similar CP interventions
with other therapy approaches.Trial status
This trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02703532)
on March 9, 2016. Recruitment of participants was initiated
on March 24, 2016. To date, we have recruited 67% of the
participants.
