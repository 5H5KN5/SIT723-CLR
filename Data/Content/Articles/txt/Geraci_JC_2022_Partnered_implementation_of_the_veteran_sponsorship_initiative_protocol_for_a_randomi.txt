Abstract 
Background: The USA is undergoing a suicide epidemic for its youngest Veterans (18-to-34-years-old) as their 
suicide rate has almost doubled since 2001. Veterans are at the highest risk during their first-year post-discharge, thus 
creating a “deadly gap.” In response, the nation has developed strategies that emphasize a preventive, universal, and 
public health approach and embrace the value of community interventions. The three-step theory of suicide suggests 
that community interventions that reduce reintegration difficulties and promote connectedness for Veterans as they 
transition to civilian life have the greatest likelihood of reducing suicide. Recent research shows that the effectiveness 
of community interventions can be enhanced when augmented by volunteer and certified sponsors (1-on-1) who 
actively engage with Veterans, as part of the Veteran Sponsorship Initiative (VSI).
Method/design: The purpose of this randomized hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial is to evaluate 
the implementation of the VSI in six cities in Texas in collaboration with the US Departments of Defense, Labor and 
Veterans Affairs, Texas government, and local stakeholders. Texas is an optimal location for this large-scale implemen-
tation as it has the second largest population of these young Veterans and is home to the largest US military installa-
tion, Fort Hood. The first aim is to determine the effectiveness of the VSI, as evidenced by measures of reintegration 
difficulties, health/psychological distress, VA healthcare utilization, connectedness, and suicidal risk. The second aim 
is to determine the feasibility and potential utility of a stakeholder-engaged plan for implementing the VSI in Texas 
with the intent of future expansion in more states. The evaluators will use a stepped wedge design with a sequential 
roll-out to participating cities over time. Participants (n=630) will be enrolled on military installations six months prior 
to discharge. Implementation efforts will draw upon a bundled implementation strategy that includes strategies such 
as ongoing training, implementation facilitation, and audit and feedback. Formative and summative evaluations will 
be guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and will

Contributions to the literature
• The USA is undergoing a suicide epidemic for its 
youngest Veterans (18-to-34-years-old) as their suicide 
rate has almost doubled since 2001. Veterans are at the 
highest risk during their first-year post-discharge, thus 
creating a “deadly gap” for them.
• A cluster randomized, stepped wedge, hybrid type 2 
effectiveness-implementation design will evaluate the 
effectiveness and implementation outcomes of the Vet -
eran Sponsorship Initiative.
• Mixed-method examination of implementation strate -
gies will directly inform national efforts to implement 
community-based interventions to address the epi -
demic of Veteran suicide.Background
The United States’ youngest Veterans are experiencing 
a suicide epidemic. Suicide rates for Veterans aged 18 
to 34 nearly doubled between 2001 and 2019, from 23.6 
per 100,000 to 44.4 per 100,000 [74]. In 2019, these rates 
were 2.73 times higher than same-aged non-Veterans and 
1.65 times higher than older Veterans (see Fig. 1).
These elevations may be due, at least in part, to elevated 
risk for suicide during the transition from active-duty 
military service to civilian life. Approximately 200,000 
servicemembers exit active-duty military service each 
year [71]. In a study of military personnel exiting service 
between 2001 and 2011, suicide rates were nearly three 
times higher during the first year following military sep -
aration compared to active duty and remained elevated 
up to 6 years following separation [57]. Correspondingly, 
some research suggests a positive association between 
severity of reintegration difficulties and risk of suicidal 
ideation [35]. The period between military discharge 
and successful reintegration into civilian life is therefore include interviews with participants and periodic reflections with key stakeholders to longitudinally identify barriers 
and facilitators to implementation.
Discussion: This evaluation will have important implications for the national implementation of community inter -
ventions that address the epidemic of Veteran suicide. Aligned with the Evidence Act, it is the first large-scale imple -
mentation of an evidence-based practice that conducts a thorough assessment of TSMVs during the “deadly gap.”

referred to as a “deadly gap” characterized by a relative 
gap in support and service and corresponding increase in 
risk for suicide [23, 60].
To date, VA-based suicide prevention initiatives have 
had limited utility, because only 26% of newly separated 
servicemembers enroll in VA healthcare [72]. Further, up 
to 70% of servicemembers and Veterans who die by sui -
cide deny suicidal ideation when assessed by healthcare 
professionals in the months preceding their death [6, 39].
In response to these challenges, the White House 
[83] recently encouraged preventative, public health 
approaches that utilize public-private partnerships 
between government agencies and community-based 
organizations to reduce servicemember and Veteran sui -
cide. Accordingly, the VA implemented a public health 
approach that emphasizes proactive, preventative, com -
munity-based interventions that target social determi -
nants of health (e.g., poor social connectedness, financial 
concerns, relationship distress), thereby reducing risk of 
suicide [9, 24, 73]. Similarly, the Commander John Scott 
Hannon Act promises $174 million to efforts supporting 
community-based interventions to mitigate suicide risk 
among Veterans, particularly those who are not partici -
pating in VA care [74].
To aid in addressing the suicide risk and broader psy -
chosocial needs of transitioning Servicemembers and 
Veterans (TSMVs), the Veteran Sponsorship Initiative 
(VSI) provides support to TSMVs throughout the tran -
sition process through connection to a trained, commu -
nity-based peer sponsor. Consistent with recent efforts to 
maximize utility of public-private partnerships, the VSI is 
driven by operational partnerships between leaders of the 
VA, US Department of Defense (DoD), US Department 
of Labor, national nonprofit organizations, and commu -
nity-based organizations. The current project represents 
the implementation of VSI at the state level.
The Veteran Sponsorship Initiative as a Suicide Prevention 
Initiative
In recent years, theorists have used the Three-Step The -
ory of suicide (3ST; [36]) to understand TSMV suicide 
(e.g., [60]). Briefly, 3ST theorizes that (a) suicidal ideation 
results from a combination of pain and hopelessness, (b) 
connectedness is a key protective factor against increas -
ing suicidal ideation severity, and (c) progression from 
suicidal ideation to attempt is moderated by the individu -
al’s capability to end one’s life.
Consistent with the first tenant of 3ST, TSMVs often 
face significant psychological pain associated with rein -
tegration into civilian life, such as that stemming from 
difficulties in education/employment, housing, food 
insecurity, health, relationship challenges, and legal involvement [11, 44, 55, 80]. Civilian employment, for 
example, is often cited as a significant reintegration con -
cern; 43% of service members are not prepared to enter 
the civilian workforce as they exit the military [68]. Cor -
respondingly, TSMVs often struggle to translate their 
military skillsets into a civilian setting, and many change 
jobs multiple times within the first few years of transition 
[41].
Consistent with the second tenant of 3ST, many 
TSMVs also struggle to maintain connectedness—in 
relationships, values, purpose, and identity—through -
out their transition [60]. While on active duty, the mili -
tary promotes these forms of connectedness through 
specially selected and trained leaders (e.g., recruiters, 
drill sergeants, unit leaders). Each provides individual -
ized support as servicemembers train with their units 
and deploy to combat. Indeed, research supports a posi -
tive association between leadership quality and mental 
health of combatants [7]. During times of transition, such 
as while conducting a permanent change of station (PCS) 
and moving from one military installation to another, 
the military also provides a PCS sponsor. For example, 
the U.S. Marine Corps has a thorough and required PCS 
sponsorship program that aims to reduce “stress and 
challenges associated with relocating” ([77], p. 2). PCS 
Sponsors are of equal rank and matched based on gen -
der, marital status, and career field. They orient incoming 
servicemembers to their installation and help to accom -
plish transition tasks, such as establishing housing and 
community supports (see Fig.  2). Support received from 
such leaders is considered critical for servicemembers 
to accomplish their designated military missions [24]. 
By contrast, as TSMVs exit the military and reintegrate 
into civilian life, they rarely experience military support 
in their post-military destinations. Throughout this pro -
cess, there are often fewer individuals, employers, family 
members, and colleagues to whom the TSMV can relate, 
and many report feeling closer to their military comrades 
than civilian counterparts after exiting the military [37].
Lastly, consistent with the final tenant of 3ST, mili -
tary training and service increases capability for suicide 
through various routes. For example, military training, 
combat exposure, and increased risk of painful experi -
ences associated with these experiences may increase 
acquired capability by desensitizing the TSMV to themes 
of death, injury, and pain [60]. Consistent with this, sui -
cide rates are typically higher among Army and Marine 
Veterans, who have more explicit and provocative com -
bat training [56]. Similarly, due to military culture, 
TSMVs are more likely than non-Veterans to own and 
have access to potentially lethal means, particularly fire -
arms [12].

The VSI structure
Informed by applications of 3ST to TSMVs, VSI aims to 
decrease TSMV suicide risk by decreasing psychologi -
cal pain often associated with the military-to-civilian 
reintegration and increasing connectedness through 
pairing of TSMVs with trained, volunteer, community-
based sponsors to support them throughout the tran -
sition process. Its structure and development were 
informed by recent legislation around public-private 
partnership approaches to suicide prevention; broader 
preventative, universal, and public health approaches 
to suicide prevention; the DoD’s PCS sponsorship pro -
gram; and recommendations from the DoD’s Best Prac -
tices Identified for Peer Support Programs [ 67].
Briefly, the VSI consists of three core elements (see 
Fig. 1 , Online Supplement):
Engage and enroll TSMVs on military installations: 
TSMVs enroll in the VSI on their military instal -
lation approximately 6 months prior to discharge 
from active-duty military service. TSMVs are 
informed of the VSI during mandatory Transition 
Assistance Program (TAP) classes [69] and encour -
aged to enroll by their chain of command. Within 
seven days of VSI enrollment, TSMVs participate in 
an intake assessment with a VSI transition coordi -nator to identify reintegration needs and confirm 
their planned post-military destination.
Connect TSMVs with trained, certified sponsors: 
Within 14 days of completing the intake assess -
ment, TSMVs are matched with a sponsor and 
connected to a community integration coordina -
tor (CIC) located in their planned post-military 
destination. After matching, TSMVs have regular 
contact with their sponsor through social media, 
email, and monthly video or in-person meet -
ings. Contact continues until TSMVs are at least 
6 months post-discharge and successfully reinte -
grated into their post-military destination.
Identify TSMV goals and needs and link with edu -
cation/employment, healthcare, and other services: 
During monthly sessions, sponsors help TSMVs to 
identify Specific-Measurable-Achievable-Relevant-
Time Bound (SMART) goals related to domains of 
reintegration and social determinants of health (see 
Fig.  2; [25]). Within 30 days of matching, sponsors 
also assist in translating these goals into an individ -
ualized reintegration plan (i.e., “My Action Plan”). 
Sponsors and TSMVs then update the My Action 
Plan periodically through follow-up sessions based 
on the TSMV’s progress.

CICs are trained, local organizations (e.g., nonprofits, 
private hospitals, or county veteran service offices) that 
enter into the VSI public-private partnership. Primary 
responsibilities of the CIC include (a) recruiting volun -
teer sponsors and ensuring they attend VA certification 
training, (b) matching TSMVs with sponsors, (c) man -
aging sponsors’ relationships with TSMVs in their local 
region, (d) submitting referrals to other agencies to assist 
TSMVs in meeting their goals, and (e) accessing and 
monitoring TSMV progress in the initiative using a com -
mon digital dashboard [75].
Because VA healthcare connection may be protective 
against Veteran suicide [74], CICs also ensure all eligible 
TSMVs are enrolled within VA healthcare and sched -
uled to attend a VA primary care appointment within 3 
months post-discharge. Such an approach is consistent 
with recent research suggesting a key predictor of VA 
enrollment and utilization is VA engagement early in the 
military discharge process [78].
Research supporting peer mentorship programs for TSMVs
An abundance of research suggests mentorship and 
sponsorship interventions may be beneficial to TSMVs. 
In a meta-analysis of 112 studies across a variety of sam -
ples, mentoring showed favorable associations with rela -
tional, career, and mental health outcomes [19]. Similarly, 
Veteran-based research attests to the value of mentoring-
based interventions in educational, health care, and crim -
inal justice contexts [2, 31, 82]. In an early pilot of VSI, 
Geraci and colleagues  (Supporting transitioning service 
members and veterans using certified sponsors: A 3-arm 
randomized controlled trial, submitted)  completed a 
randomized controlled trial in which 203 post-9/11 Vet -
erans in the greater New York City area were randomly 
assigned to participate in either (a) a community-based 
Veteran social organization, (b) both a community-based 
Veteran social organization and VSI, or (c) a waitlist con -
trol condition. Results suggested Veterans participating 
in both a community-based Veterans social organization 
and VSI reported notably fewer reintegration difficulties 
and greater social connectedness (aligning to the first and 
second tenants of 3ST; [60]) across the course of their 
participation than Veterans in other conditions.
Potential implications of the VSI
The current evaluation represents the first large-scale 
implementation of an evidence-based practice for TSMVs 
during the “deadly gap” of transition from military ser -
vice to civilian life. Since establishment of the Foun -
dations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (US PL 
115-435) of 2018, VA must use evidence and evaluation 
to inform policies and budget allocations [29]. Therefore, the current evaluation has important implications for 
informing national implementation of community-based 
interventions to address the epidemic of TSMV suicide.
This evaluation is funded through a peer-reviewed 
Partnered Evaluation Initiative (PEI) grant provided 
by the VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative 
(QUERI). PEI grants are a principal method of the VA to 
meet requirements of the Evidence-Based Policymaking 
Act. They focus on improving Veteran health by rapidly 
implementing evidence-based practices and planning for 
national scale-up and spread. Accordingly, this evalua -
tion serves to implement the VSI throughout the state of 
Texas through a coordinated partnership between the VA 
QUERI, VA leadership within Texas (Veterans Integrated 
Services Network 17), and community partners.  Texas 
has the second-largest population of Veterans aged 18 to 
34 years old [76], which makes it an ideal setting for ini -
tial rollout of the VSI.
Study aims
This evaluation is a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-imple -
mentation evaluation. The first aim of this evaluation is 
to assess the effectiveness of the VSI in improving proxi -
mal (reintegration difficulties, health/psychological dis -
tress, VA healthcare utilization, and connectedness) and 
distal (suicidal ideation and behaviors) factors associ -
ated with risk during the military-to-civilian transition. 
The second aim is to determine feasibility and utility of 
a bundled implementation strategy to expand the VSI to 
six cities in Texas (Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas/
Fort Worth, El Paso, and Corpus Christi; selected due to 
their proportionally large Veteran populations). Third, we 
intend to develop procedures to facilitate future expan -
sion in other states. Design, implementation, and evalu -
ation of the VSI is informed by the Reach, Effectiveness, 
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework 
(RE-AIM; [22]).
Methods
Evaluation framework and study design
This evaluation will use a stepped wedge design, which 
relies on sequential roll-out to participating cities over 
time, while using other cities as controls until they begin 
implementation. This design allows for both within-site 
and between-site comparisons of data. For within-site 
comparisons, each city will act as their own control by 
comparing data pre- versus post-implementation and 
throughout the transition from control (transition as 
usual; TAU) to intervention status. Between-site com -
parisons will compare TAU versus intervention cities. 
This combination of analyses will improve validity of the 
evaluation by minimizing statistical effects of histori -
cal trends occurring outside of the intervention and/or 
Page 6 of 14 Geraci et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:43 
contextual characteristics that may impact an individual 
city’s performance.
The assignment of intervention status was randomized 
at the city level, and data from TSMVs will inform pri -
mary quantitative outcome analyses. Of the six cities par -
ticipating in this evaluation, two cities were allocated to 
each of the three start dates (see Fig.  3). Because cities 
differ in local community and organization characteris -
tics, we used the restricted selection method of randomi -
zation to balance cities across the three implementation 
steps over time [3] according to the number of projected 
TSMVs moving to each target location. Stratified rand -
omization using methods described by Suresh [64] and 
computer programming were used for randomization 
procedures.
TSMV participants and recruitment
To participate in VSI, TSMVs must be at least 18 years 
old, approximately 6 months from military discharge, 
and planning to transition to one of the evaluation’s tar -
get cities during an active enrollment window (see Fig.  3). TSMVs will be recruited from military installations 
across the USA. The first 105 TSMVs enrolled per step 
will be assigned to the TAU condition, and the next 105 
TSMVs per step will be assigned to the VSI.
The sample size was determined by completing a sta -
tistical power analysis using the powerlmm package 
[40] for R [52]. To test the primary hypothesis—that VSI 
reduces reintegration difficulties—using multilevel mod -
eling with power of 80%, alpha of .05, and a small effect 
size (Cohen’s d=0.2). Total enrolled TSMVs needed 
across the six cities is 630. This sample size allows for 
adjustments required under randomization, design 
effects, and a dropout rate of 20% per follow-up.
Potential sponsors will be recruited in target cit -
ies using social media outreach with the local VA, Vet -
eran service organizations, and college and university 
alumni networks. In accordance with previous research, 
we anticipate a sponsor attrition rate of approximately 
20%. To mitigate the risk of a shortage of sponsors, 
the VSI aims to certify at least 600 sponsors across the 
evaluation.

Implementation strategies
A phased, bundled implementation strategy was devel -
oped according to the QUERI Implementation Roadmap 
[27, 34] and the Expert Recommendations for Imple -
menting Change taxonomy [49] based on needs and bar -
riers identified in an earlier pilot of the VSI. Strategies 
have been selected as appropriate to the unique chal -
lenges of the implementation phase—pre-implementa -
tion, implementation, and sustainment (see Fig.  4). As a 
pre-requisite to studying the implementation strategies 
empirically, the evaluators followed the reporting specifi -
cations provided by Proctor et al. [51] specific to naming, 
clearly describing, and operationalizing the respective 
implementation strategies (see Table  1, Online Supple -
ment) with highlights provided below. We anticipate that 
the implementation strategies will assist in addressing the 
following barriers: (a) perceived competing priorities by 
local VA and community partners, (b) lack of awareness 
of the initiative, (c) challenges of coordinating and com -
municating across many stakeholders (nonprofit; local, 
state and federal agencies), and (d) need for sustained 
funding.
Pre‑implementation
1. Build a coalition [49] and obtain formal commit -
ments [49]. The VSI  will identify and select CICs within each city based on predetermined crite -
ria (see Table  1, Online Supplement). After selec -
tion, the VA will assist in the drafting and signing 
of a formal memorandum of agreement (MOA) 
between (1) selected CICs and (2) VA leadership 
within Texas (Veterans Integrated Services Network 
17). MOAs will identify key responsibilities of each 
partner.
2. Conduct ongoing training [49]. The VA will train 
CICs, sponsors, VSI transition coordinators, and 
VA Regional Community Coordinators (VA RCCs) 
in accordance with the sponsor certification man -
ual (see [25]) and the implementation toolkit. To 
support rapid expansion of the VSI and address 
challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
trainings will be offered in-person and virtually in 
each city.
3. Use data warehousing techniques [49]. The VSI 
will work collaboratively with community partners 
to develop referral workflows and plans for data 
warehousing. Appropriate authorizations will be 
secured and necessary procedures established to 
allow collected data to be utilized for operational 
and evaluation purposes.  The VSI has worked with 
partners to ensure there is a  virtual dashboard to 
organize data and efforts by the CICs throughout 
this evaluation.

Implementation
4. Implementation facilitation [46]. The VA will hire 
and train VA RCCs to serve as external facilitators 
in Texas. These coordinators will be subject matter 
experts in assisting TSMVs throughout the military-
to-civilian transition and will assist in implementa -
tion by developing an implementation toolkit and 
providing active support for the change process, 
including through audit and feedback activities with 
CICs. This toolkit will include guidebooks for (1) VA 
RCCs, (2) VSI Transition Coordinators, and (3) CICs. 
VA RCCs will also support change efforts, including 
identifying compatible workflows and create action -
able plans to put best practices in place [46].
5. Audit and provide feedback [49]. Working with the 
evaluation team, the VA RCC will conduct assess -
ments of performance of CICs and provide feedback 
from the assessments to CIC comparing their current 
status to prior time periods and a priori standards as 
benchmarks.
Sustainment
6. Increase demand [49] and Access new funding [49]. 
The evaluation team will develop quarterly reports 
and share them with VISN leadership in Texas, VA 
national leadership, local and state leadership, CICs 
in Texas, and potential CICs in other states. Within 
the reports, the team will highlight the status regard -
ing VSI implementation and effectiveness variables. 
Following implementation, the evaluators will report 
on the overall budget impact analysis to support sus -
tainment at the city level, as well as identify necessary 
resources to support initiative spread to other states. 
As part of the budget impact analysis, the evaluators 
will collect implementation and intervention cost 
data, including VA and non-VA materials, training 
costs, dashboard development/technology costs, CIC 
and transition coordinator personnel time and costs, 
and travel expenses. VHA healthcare utilization costs 
will be determined from accessing VHA adminis -
trative data on VHA cost and utilization to estimate 
the budget impact of implementing the VSI program 
using recommended approaches for budget impact 
analysis [63]. These health care costs will include 
VHA inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and VHA-paid 
community care costs with total costs estimated per 
TSMV per year and adjusted for inflation [17]. This 
will help to ensure sustainment in Texas and justify 
further allocation of funding for expansion into other 
states.RE‑AIM
The RE-AIM framework (see Table  2, Online supple -
ment) will allow the VSI to plan, assess, and adapt to 
the complexities resulting from a multi-organizational, 
collaborative endeavor across numerous locations. 
City-level analyses will examine RE-AIM measures 
before, during, and after implementation and facili -
tate formative and summative evaluation. Reach  will be 
assessed by calculating the percent of eligible TSMVs 
who sign up for the VSI on respective military instal -
lations. Effectiveness will be assessed by TSMV-level 
data for proximal and distal variables (See Measures for 
more information). Adoption will be assessed by calcu -
lating the percent of sponsor candidates who complete 
certification and by counting the number of CICs who 
sign a VA Memorandum of Agreement.
Implementation will be assessed by four dimen -
sions [5 ]: (a) Fidelity refers to adherence or program 
integrity and is the extent to which specified pro -
gram components are delivered as prescribed [18]. 
To assess fidelity, we developed fidelity trackers that 
will assess to what extent core elements of the inter -
vention are delivered as intended (see Table  2, Online 
Supplement); (b) Quality of delivery addresses the 
skill and behaviors with which sponsors deliver the 
VSI during their interactions with TSMVs. As part 
of the evaluation, TSMVs will complete an evalua -
tion of their sponsor through the Leader-Behavior-
Description-Questionnaire--Form XII [62] to assess 
the degree to which they perceive sponsors as engag -
ing in relational-oriented and task-oriented leadership 
behaviors; (c) Adaptation concerns changes made to 
a program during implementation. Research attests 
to the value of allowing local communities to adapt 
programs according to the needs of a local population 
[47]. Adaptations will be documented and tracked 
using qualitative data from periodic reflections (see 
below). For this evaluation, we will (1) determine if 
observed changes stem from lack of fidelity or adapta -
tion, and (2) categorize adaptations as either additions 
(i.e., activities or materials not part of the original ini -
tiative) or modification (i.e., activities or materials that 
were part of the original initiative but implemented 
in a way beyond prescribed variations). Evaluators 
will recommend sustainment and expansion of adap -
tations perceived as being effective and beneficial to 
TSMVs; (d) Participant responsiveness is identified as 
“levels of participation and enthusiasm” ([16], p. 45). 
We will measure participant responsiveness by cal -
culating the number of sessions TSMV-sponsor pairs 
attend, percent of initial “My Action Plans” completed 
Page 9 of 14
 Geraci et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:43 
 
by TSMV-sponsor pairs within 30 days of matching, 
number of monthly updates made to action plans, and 
level of TSMV satisfaction with the VSI.
Maintenance will be assessed after the implemen -
tation phase and operationalized as the number of 
sponsors and CICs that remain engaged with the VSI, 
number of new sponsors registered, number of newly 
enrolled TSMVs, and continued VA funding dedicated 
to sustainment and expansion of the VSI.Measures
To facilitate evaluation of the VSI effectiveness, TSMVs will 
complete a range of online self-report measures and clinical 
interviews (Table  1; Fig.  2, Online Supplement). TSMVs will 
provide data at Time 1 (Baseline: 6 months prior to military 
discharge), Time 2 (2 months prior to military discharge), 
Time 3 (2 months post military discharge), and Time 4 (6 
months post military discharge). To maximize clinical util -
ity of data, many included measures are routinely adminis -
tered at VA medical centers.

Reintegration difficulties and social determinants of health
Reintegration difficulties will be broadly assessed using 
the Military to Civilian Questionnaire (M2C-Q; [54]), 
a 16-item measure that assesses difficulties in (a) inter -
personal relationships with family, friends, and peers; (b) 
productivity at work, school, or home; (c) community 
participation; (d) self-care; (e) leisure; and (f) perceived 
meaning in life. The M2C-Q was initially validated in a 
sample of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans seeking VA 
healthcare services [54] and has since shown strong con -
struct validity and internal reliability in numerous Vet -
eran samples [10, 53].
Employment/education and income/savings status will 
be assessed by asking TSMVs to self-report the income 
of themselves and (if applicable) their spouse/domes -
tic partner and other immediate family members; cur -
rent educational enrollment status; current work status; 
job satisfaction; hours worked/salary over the last week 
for themselves and (if applicable) their spouse/domestic 
partner; and money set aside for financial emergency. 
TSMVs who are not currently employed or enrolled in 
school will be asked to report whether they are actively 
looking for paid employment and strategies used to find 
paid employment. Those not actively looking for paid 
employment will be asked to provide reasons for not 
looking for paid employment.
We will also analyze broader societal impacts of TSMV 
employment and education using common job training 
benefit methodologies (e.g., [4, 42]). For example, we will 
calculate aggregate increases in productivity attributable 
to TSMV employment stemming from VSI participation, 
long-term growth in productivity associated with TSMV 
higher education pursuit, potential increases in tax rev -
enue for municipalities, and reductions in social welfare 
benefit payments. To project these aggregate income, tax 
revenue, and social welfare benefit changes, we will use 
point estimates from the evaluation coupled with esti -
mates on typical variation in productivity and social wel -
fare benefits from labor market entry.
Resilience will be assessed using the Brief Resilience 
Scale (BRS; [59]), a six-item (e.g., “I tend to bounce back 
quickly after hard times. ”) scale with strong evidence of 
validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency 
across samples [84].
Homelessness will be assessed using the VA Homeless -
ness Screening Clinical Reminder (HSCR; [43]), a four-
item (e.g., “In the past two months, have you been living 
in stable housing that you own, rent, or stay in as part of 
a household?”) measure that assesses current homeless -
ness or imminent risk of homelessness among Veter -
ans. The HSCR is considered standard care within VA 
settings to identify and respond to instances of Veteran 
homelessness.Food insecurity will be assessed using the U.S. Adult 
Food Security Survey Module [70], a three-stage screen -
ing measure for assessing food insecurity. An example 
question is: “Within the past 12 months, the food that 
I bought just didn’t last, and I didn’t have money to get 
more. ” A response of “often” or “sometimes” indicates 
food insecurity.
Criminal behaviors will be assessed using a series of 
self-report items, including “Within the last 12 months 
have you been issued a ticket of any kind for a traffic 
violation (e.g., speeding, failure to signal)?”; “Within the 
last 12 months have you been arrested or charged for 
any type of criminal offense (e.g., DUI, disorderly con -
duct, drug offense, domestic violence, assault, robbery)?”; 
and “Within the last 12 months, has a restraining order, 
no contact agreement, or order of protection been initi -
ated or taken against you?” Many studies have suggested 
self-report methods show good agreement with official 
records and are a generally valid means of assessing crim -
inal behavior (e.g., [45]).
Well-Being Signs is a three-item screening measure, 
based on the work of Vogt et al. [79] used to assess how 
TSMVs are doing in their daily lives. It asks TSMVs to 
rate what percentage of time (from 0 to 100%) that they 
have been “Fully satisfied with how things are going in 
these aspects of life?” , “Regularly involved in all aspects 
of life that are important to you?” , and “Functioning your 
best in aspects of life that you do participate in?” .
Health and healthcare utilization
Mental health difficulties will be assessed using the 
Patient Health Quesitonnaire-9 [38], Generalized Anxi -
ety Disorder Questionnaire [61], Primary Care PTSD 
5 [50], Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Con -
sumption [8], and Level of Personality Functioning 
Scale-Brief Form 2.0 [81]. These brief measures have 
demonstrated strong validity and reliability across sam -
ples [1, 13, 15, 32, 38, 50].
Somatic symptom burden related to stomach problems, 
back pain, headaches, chest pain, dizziness, energy, and 
sleep will be assessed by the Somatic Symptom Scale 8 
[26]. Previous studies with Veterans demonstrated good 
item characteristics and excellent reliability, a sound fac -
tor structure and significant associations with related 
constructs like depression, anxiety, pain, quality of life, 
and impairment [65].
VA healthcare enrollment and utilization will be 
assessed through data in access to the VA Corporate 
Data Warehouse (CDW), which enables evaluators to 
determine rates of VHA enrollment and utilization. 
Utilization outcomes will include the number of VHA 
encounters per TSMVs per year for in-person and video 
telehealth primary care, mental health, specialty care, 
Page 11 of 14
 Geraci et al. Implementation Science           (2022) 17:43 
 
and emergency department visits, as well as in-patient 
and acute hospital stays (e.g., acute medical/surgical 
or psychiatric inpatient care; [28]). Utilization of VHA-
sponsored care in the community will be obtained from 
community care data (Patient Integrity Tool data and Fee 
Basis data).
Social connectedness
Connectedness will be assessed using the Medical Out -
comes Study Social Support Survey [58], a 19-item self-
report measure of perceived availability of social support 
or connectedness that has demonstrated strong psycho -
metric properties in military [20], Veteran [14, 66], and 
civilian samples [58].
Suicide ideation and behaviors
Suicidal ideation and behaviors will be assessed using 
questions from the Columbia  Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale screener [48] supplemented by questions based on 
cues provided in the full screener about suicide attempts 
and injuries [33].
Qualitative data collection
Semi‑structured interviews
TSMVs will also participate in qualitative interviews 
at Time 1 and Time 4 to facilitate formative evaluation. 
At Time 1, TSMVs will provide information about their 
motivation and hopes for VSI enrollment and primary 
concerns prior to military discharge. At Time 4, they will 
provide information about their experience with the VSI, 
including strengths of VSI and areas for improvement.
Periodic reflections
To identify event, adaptations, and contextual factors 
impacting adoption, implementation, and maintenance, 
the evaluators will also integrate periodic reflections—
an innovative, low-burden method for documenting 
implementation phenomena such as barriers, facilita -
tors, and adaptations that occur during implementation 
[21]. These lightly structured and guided reflections 
will occur monthly with members of the evaluation 
team and quarterly with other key partners (e.g., spon -
sors, CICs, military installations). These reflections will 
increase qualitative data points throughout implementa -
tion, thereby increasing the likelihood of identifying and 
understanding sources of variation in implementation.
Analyses
Multilevel models will be used to analyze quantitative 
data. TSMVs will be nested within each city when ana -
lyzing data collected during the specified timepoints. 
Multilevel random effects models examine within- and 
between-group change across time and by group (TAU vs. VSI). Multilevel modeling accounts for the underly -
ing heterogeneity between and within participants (i.e., 
intercepts and slopes are allowed to vary across partici -
pants) and allows for identification of differences in rates 
of change (slopes) in the dependent variables between 
groups and controlling for confounding variables that 
may influence TSMV outcomes (e.g., gender). Multilevel 
models account for missing data by estimating the best 
fitting model from the data available for each participant 
[30]. Therefore, all data points for TSMVs who complete 
the pre-implementation assessment will be included in 
intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses.
During qualitative interviews, near-verbatim notes 
from TSMV interviews and periodic reflections with 
partners will be uploaded and maintained in Atlas.ti 
qualitative software, allowing for qualitative and mixed-
method analyses. Qualitative thematic analysis will be 
used to identify the most frequently mentioned content 
areas. Independent coders will separate response text and 
conduct thematic analysis to identify topics occurring 
repeatedly (themes). Coders will independently review 
responses and hold meetings to finalize a list of key 
themes before systematically coding all responses.
Discussion
As suicide rates for young and transitioning Veterans 
have increased, national efforts have emphasized pre -
ventative, universal, and public health approaches that 
embrace the value of public-private partnerships between 
government agencies and community organizations. 
As suggested by the 3ST, interventions that reduce pain 
associated with reintegration difficulties and improve 
connectedness may reduce TSMV risk for suicide [60]. 
By partnering with organizations already serving this 
high-risk subset of the Veteran population and incorpo -
rating sponsor-based programming, national suicide pre -
vention efforts may be more effective.
This evaluation will have important implications for 
national implementation of community-based interven -
tions to address the epidemic of TSMV suicide. Aligned 
with the Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, it is the first 
large-scale implementation of an evidence-based prac -
tice that supports TSMVs during the “deadly gap” of 
transition from military service to civilian life. The pro -
tocol outlined in this manuscript—a hybrid type 2 effec -
tiveness-implementation evaluation—was developed in 
close partnership with relevant operations partners and 
will use state-of-the-art evaluation methods to answer 
key questions about how to best implement and sustain 
the VSI. A combination of quantitative and qualitative 
analyses will also allow for development of clear imple -
mentation and sustainment guidelines for operations 
partners.
