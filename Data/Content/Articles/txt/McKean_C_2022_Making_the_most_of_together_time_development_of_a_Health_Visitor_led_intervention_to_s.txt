Abstract 
Background: Early interventions to support young children’s language development through responsive par -
ent–child interaction have proven efficacy but are not currently delivered universally. A potential universal delivery 
platform is the Health Visitor (HV)–led 2–2½-year-old review in England’s Healthy Child Programme. It is unclear if it is 
feasible to offer such interventions through this platform. We report an intervention development process, including 
extensive stakeholder consultation and co-design which aimed to develop an acceptable, feasible and equitable early 
language intervention for delivery in this context.
Methods: The study involved five phases including 13 stakeholder co-design workshops with 7 parents and 39 prac-
titioners (HVs, early years practitioners and speech and language therapists): (1) Identification of existing intervention 
evidence, (2) qualitative review of intervention studies extracting candidate target behaviours for intervention and 
intervention techniques, (3) co-design workshops with parents and practitioners examining acceptability, barriers and 
enablers to those behaviours and techniques (particular attention was paid to diverse family circumstances and the 
range of barriers which might exist), (4) findings were analysed using COM-B and theoretical domains frameworks and 
a prototype intervention model designed, and (5) co-design workshops iteratively refined the proposed model.
Results: Practitioners were committed to offering language intervention at the 2–2½-year-old review but were not 
sure precisely how to do so. Parents/caregivers wanted to be proactive and to have agency in supporting their own 
children and to do this as soon as possible. For equitable intervention, it must be proportionate, with higher ‘intensity’ 
for higher levels of disadvantage, and tailored, offering differing approaches considering the specific barriers and 
enablers, assets and challenges in each family. The importance and potential fragility of alliances between parent/car -
egiver and practitioner were identified as key, and so, strategies to engender successful collaborative partnership are 
also embedded in intervention design.
Conclusion: It is possible to develop a universal intervention which parents and practitioners judge would be 
acceptable, feasible and equitable for use at the 2–2½-year review to promote children’s language development. The

Key messages regarding feasibility
1) What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibility?
• Early interventions to support young children’s 
language development through responsive par -
ent–child interaction have proven efficacy but 
are not currently delivered universally.
• A potential universal delivery platform is the 
Health Visitor (HV)–led 2–2½-year-old review 
in England’s Healthy Child Programme.
• It is unclear if it is feasible to offer such interven -
tions through this platform.
2) What are the key feasibility findings?
• It is possible to develop a universal intervention 
for use at the 2–2½-year review to promote chil -
dren’s language development which practitioners 
and parents consider would be acceptable, feasi -
ble and equitable.
• For equitable intervention, it must be propor -
tionate, with higher ‘intensity’ for higher levels 
of disadvantage, and tailored, offering differ -
ing approaches considering the specific barri -
ers and enablers, assets and challenges in each 
family.
• The importance and potential fragility of alli -
ances between parent/caregiver and practi -
tioner were identified as key, and so, strategies 
to engender successful collaborative partner -
ship are essential for success and must also be 
embedded in intervention design.
3) What are the implications of the feasibility findings 
for the design of the main study?
• The intervention devised provides a protocol 
for delivery which participants felt would be 
acceptable, feasible and equitable; however, it is 
untested in practice.
• Further work is also needed for ELIM-I to be 
accessible to families from a range of linguistic 
and cultural backgrounds.
• Further work is required to develop and pilot a 
manualised programme with standardised inter -vention resources and guidance for local imple -
mentation and policy development.
Background
The early years of a child’s life lay the foundation for their 
health, education and wellbeing across the life course [1, 
2]. A child’s language development in these early years is 
a key component of that foundation and is now widely 
recognised as a crucial indicator of an individual’s ‘life 
chances’ [3]. Children who enter school (aged 5–6 years) 
with language difficulties are at risk of poorer long-term 
outcomes with respect to adolescent educational attain -
ment and social–emotional wellbeing [4], adult literacy, 
mental health, employment [5, 6], health literacy [7], 
social anxiety and isolation [8]. Given that prevalence 
estimates suggest that, on average, every primary school 
classroom in England contains two children with signifi -
cant language difficulties [9], reaching up to 40% in the 
most disadvantaged communities [10], this is a substan -
tial challenge for educational, social and health services.
Many social and educational policies around the world 
make robust early language development a key objec -
tive [11–13]. A great deal is known about the aspects of 
a child’s early learning environment which can be har -
nessed to promote positive language outcomes in the 
pre-school period due to several systematic reviews and 
efficacy and epidemiological studies [14–22]. Despite 
this, the development of an intervention, which can be 
delivered universally, affordably and effectively for chil -
dren under the age of 3 years, has remained elusive. 
Recently, the case has been made that early language and 
communication needs should be tackled through public 
health preventive models of intervention [23]. In the UK, 
the Healthy Child Programme provides support from 0 
to 19 years of age and is led by Public Health England 
(PHE) aiming to ‘improve the health of babies, children 
and their families to enable a happy healthy childhood 
and provide the foundations of good health into adult life’ 
[24–26]. In the 0–5-year period, this programme of work 
is led by Health Visiting Teams. HVs are specialist nurses, 
and their teams often include trained early years educa -
tors. The teams are separate from but closely linked to 
family doctors and paediatric services and provide fami -
lies with a programme of screening, immunisation and 
health and development reviews, supplemented by advice result is one of the most explicitly developed universal interventions to promote children’s language development. 
Further development and piloting is required to develop materials to support successful widespread implementation.

around health, wellbeing and parenting. In 2018, PHE 
identified early language development as one of six ‘high 
impact’ areas where HV services can make the greatest 
difference [27]. Whilst such ambitions and their ration -
ale are clearly stated in policy, precisely how to ensure 
all children are supported to achieve positive language 
outcomes is less well specified. Furthermore, whilst the 
HV 2–2½-year-old review has been the focus of timely 
identification of speech, language and communication 
needs (SLCN) using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 
(ASQ-3) nationally mandated pre-assessment tool [28], 
the mode, content and delivery of this contact is variable, 
and interventions commonly lack conceptual and prac -
tical detail. In recognition of this, the Department for 
Education (DfE) commissioned a programme of training 
and research to develop a national approach to support 
the development of children’s early language and led by 
PHE [29]. This research strand developed a novel tool for 
HV teams to identify children at risk of poor language 
development and a linked intervention: the Early Lan -
guage Identification Measure and Intervention (ELIM-I) 
[30, 31]. Here, we focus on the development of the inter -
vention component of the ELIM-I, whilst a description of 
the development of the identification measure is reported 
elsewhere [32].
This paper outlines the development of a universal 
intervention to offer to families at the HV 2–2½-year-old 
review to promote robust language development for all 
children. Our aim was to develop an intervention which 
aligns with the aims, principles and structure of the mod -
ernised HCP [33]. That is, an approach with ‘universal 
reach and a personalised response’ to be led by HV teams 
in England, and which focusses, in the first instance, on 
the universal 2–2½-year-old review and draws on the 
wider children’s workforce, as necessary. Following guid -
ance on the development of complex and public health 
interventions, we sought to develop an intervention 
which is acceptable, equitable, practicable, can be deliv -
ered at scale, and which is based on current best evidence 
and underpinned by relevant theory [34–36].
As with any public health intervention, there is a risk 
that universal approaches can inadvertently widen rather 
than narrow inequalities if the necessary attention is not 
paid to structural factors which influence a family’s abil -
ity to engage in a given health-promoting behaviour [37]. 
There is evidence to suggest this is a real risk for early 
language interventions [38, 39]. An alternative is to apply 
‘proportionate universalism’ where intensity of action 
is proportionate to the level of disadvantage [40]. How -
ever, intensity is not the only characteristic which can 
and should be tailored to the individual circumstances 
of a family. Much of the existing evidence regarding 
pre-school language interventions focusses on building capacity in parents/caregivers: their knowledge and skills 
as to how to create a language enriching environment for 
their child. Insufficient attention has been paid to other 
factors associated with structural inequalities such as 
families’ opportunities and resources as well as affec -
tive factors such as their optimism and belief about their 
capabilities [41, 42]. For an equitable intervention to be 
designed, we must not only create a proportionate model 
(i.e. with higher ‘intensity’ for higher levels of disadvan -
tage need [40]) but also a tailored one, offering differing 
approaches considering the specific barriers and ena -
blers, assets and challenges in each family [43].
In conclusion, the aim was to develop an intervention 
that is
• Acceptable, practicable and can be delivered at scale;
• Based on current best evidence and underpinned by 
relevant theory;
• Proportionate to the assets and challenges of individ -
ual families;
• Tailored to the barriers and enablers present for indi -
vidual families; and
• Well specified in its methods to enable fidelity in 
delivery.
Overarching methodology
The Medical Research Council’s guidance for the devel -
opment and evaluation of complex interventions 
emphasises the importance of rigorous intervention 
development [34]. However, it is only relatively recently 
that detailed, systematic and replicable methods for this 
first phase of intervention research have been specified 
[41, 44]. Our methods align with the most recent guid -
ance by O’Caithan and colleagues published in 2019 [35], 
and are an adaptation of those described by O’Brien et al. 
[44]. This iterative and sequential method is designed 
to enable the integration of published scientific evi -
dence, expert knowledge and experience and detailed 
consideration of stakeholder knowledge and views. We 
remained open to change, and processes were developed 
and adapted as necessary in response to outcomes at 
each stage. We made use of the expertise of the research 
team at several stages to challenge, develop and contex -
tualise intervention development. The team comprised 
researchers with backgrounds in Speech and Language 
Therapy, General Practice, Health Visiting (practice and 
policy), Psychology, Medical Sociology and Linguistics. 
In addition, reflections from a parallel study regard -
ing the acceptability of the ELIM/developmental review 
were used to challenge interpretations/analyses  (Holme 
C, et  al. Parental experiences and perspectives of the 
2–2½ year developmental review process for identifying 
Page 4 of 26 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
speech, language and communication needs. Under 
review). Furthermore, we report the intervention 
development following recognised reporting guidance 
(GUIDED) [45].
Theoretical perspective
We drew on existing theory in several ways. First, 
with respect to child language development, we were 
informed by socio-cognitive theories [46– 48] which 
emphasise the importance of responsive interactions 
with caregivers for robust language development. A 
number of infant socio-cognitive skills are also cru -
cial to early language development: the ability to share 
attention with adults, understand their communica -
tive intentions and take turns in conversations [49]. 
Language is learned best in responsive social interac -
tions between caregiver and infant where the language 
used by the adult is contingent on the child’s attention 
and where the child is deploying these socio-cognitive 
abilities to infer meaning and maintain the interac -
tion [19, 21, 22, 49]. Importantly, caregiver-responsive 
contingent interactions also facilitate the development 
of these socio-cognitive abilities and so are critical to 
robust language and communication development 
from the very earliest days of a child’s life [50]. Sec -
ond, we planned to apply Behaviour Change Theory to 
the intervention development drawing on the Behav -
iour Change Wheel [41] and the Theoretical Domains 
Framework (TDF) [42]. Third, the Theoretical Frame -
work of Acceptability (TFA) [51] informed the develop -
ment of stakeholder co-design workshop materials.
As data were collected and analysed, it became clear 
that consideration of the socio-relational aspects of the 
intervention was essential and must inform interven -
tion design if an effective and acceptable approach was 
to be developed. Additional theory relating to princi -
ples of shared decision-making, therapeutic alliance, 
trust and engagement was therefore also consulted [36, 
52–59].
When attending to future implementation, normali -
sation process theory (NPT) was also considered [60]. 
Embedding health care innovations into routine prac -
tice is not straightforward and requires explicit planning. 
NPT suggests that four kinds of work need to occur for 
an innovation to become ‘normalised’ practice: coherence 
work (or sense-making), participation work (or engage -
ment), enacting work (action to enable the intervention 
to happen) and appraisal work (reflection and monitoring 
of the benefits and costs) [61]. When designing the inter -
vention, where HV teams were on the ‘journey’ towards 
normalisation of support for children’s language devel -
opment was considered to ensure the approach devised 
takes the necessary next steps. Future implementation was also considered through the lens of acceptability and 
considering APEASE criteria (Affordability Practicability, 
Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, Acceptability, Safety 
and Equity) throughout the stages of development [41, 
51].
Ethics
All relevant details about the project were submitted to 
the West Midlands–Black Country NHS Research Eth -
ics Committee (REC), and a favourable ethical opinion 
was received on the 7th of May 2019 (REC reference 19/
WM/0114 project # 261205). Research and development 
(R&D) management approvals were then received from 
the five sites involved in the study. Participants gave fully 
informed consent before each workshop/data collection 
episode.
Design
An iterative design process was followed through which 
evidence was gathered and appraised, relevant theory 
identified and applied, and intervention models and 
materials generated, tested and analysed. There were four 
stages, each stage providing results which then formed 
the basis of the design of the next phase (Fig.  1). Stages 
3 and 4 comprised co-design workshops with parents 
and practitioners. A total of 13 stakeholder co-design 
workshops were completed: seven in Stage 3 and six in 
Stage 4. Members of the research team reflected on and 
discussed processes and outputs over the course of the 
study. A number of Public Patient Involvement (PPI) 
workshops also contributed to knowledge of the context 
of the interventions.
Sites
PHE led a selection process to identify 5 sites to host 
the ELIM-I study based on prevalence of speech, lan -
guage and communication needs (SLCN) (as indicated 
by school readiness), prevalence of risk factors associ -
ated with SLCN (including free school meal eligibility as 
a proxy for socio-economic status and English as an addi -
tional language) and the availability of site data. The sites 
included a mix of urban, rural, northern and southern 
geographies and a range of service delivery models [32]. 
Table  1 presents a summary of the demographic detail 
for the local authority areas of the 5 sites drawing on data 
from the Office of National Statistics [62, 63].
Participants
Study contacts at each site provided meeting facilities 
and acted as gatekeepers to participant recruitment. 
For practitioners, study contacts were asked to invite 
members of the HV team (HVs and community nurs -
ery nurses (CNN)) and relevant members of the Speech

and Language Therapy (SLT) team. For parents/car -
egivers, they were asked to invite parents of children 
aged 3–6 years currently receiving support for their 
SLCN (Table  2). This was to allow us to engage with 
the experiences of families with recent experience of 
the pathway from identification to receipt of support. 
Seven parents were involved across the workshops. 
Two parents attended two co-design workshops, and 
five attended one. Parents were given shopping vouch -
ers as a token of appreciation for their time, and their 
travel expenses were reimbursed.
Thirty-nine different practitioners were involved 
across the workshops. A range of practitioner roles were represented with the substantial majority being 
HVs or community nursery nurses working within the 
HV team. This allowed for issues of acceptability, prac -
ticability, implementation and equity to be explored. 
SLTs were also represented to draw on their knowledge 
of local SLCN pathways and of successful language 
intervention models and techniques. A total of seven 
different parents/caregivers participated, one of whom 
spoke English as an additional language, and 36 differ -
ent practitioners (18 HVs, 6 community nursery nurses, 
2 student HVs, 1 family nurse, 1 student nurse, 6 speech 
and language therapists, 2 speech and language therapy 
assistants). Parent/caregiver participant recruitment 
was affected by the government restrictions associated Table 1 Summary on demographic detail for the local authority areas of the 5 sites

Sites 4 and 2 were probably affected by the growing 
anxiety at that time, and a final planned workshop in 
Site 5 with twelve families recruited had to be cancelled 
due to travel restrictions immediately prior to the first 
UK lockdown.
Methods and results
Due to the iterative and interconnected nature of the 
study design, the following presents the methods and 
results for the four stages in turn. Figure  1 summarises 
the methods, objectives and results of each stage and 
their linkage.
Stage 1 methods
To identify evidence-based interventions in a parsimo -
nious fashion, the starting point for Stage 1 was previ -
ous systematic and scoping reviews [15, 16, 64–67]. This 
ensured a level of quality assurance and relevance with -
out the need for full systematic reviewing of the interven -
tion literature. The knowledge and expertise of the team 
was utilised within a workshop to review and analyse 
identified intervention studies to determine their quality 
and relevance to the HV check (see Supplementary mate -
rials 1 for additional detail) and to make explicit key rel -
evant components of the interventions.
Stage 1 results
A final set of 16 papers was identified detailing effective 
interventions of relevance to the HV assessment (see 
Supplementary materials 1). A simple preliminary logic 
model of the intervention was designed based on initial 
review of the interventions and workshop discussions 
(Fig. 2).Stage 2 methods
The intervention papers identified in Stage 1 were exam -
ined and the target behaviours of the effective interven -
tions and the intervention techniques extracted.
‘Personae’ were developed for use in practitioner 
workshops at Stage 3 to explore how any interven -
tion would need to be tailored for different families to 
ensure equity and proportionality [68]. These personae 
described families with whom the practitioner might 
work which vary according to characteristics that may 
affect a family’s ability to engage with an intervention 
and/or the target health-promoting behaviour. Their 
use in our data collection methods aimed to make 
explicit expert practitioner knowledge and clinical 
decision-making, which can often be tacit or implicit 
[69]. To develop persona in an objective, empirically 
based manner and avoid the danger of pejorative or 
reductive stereotypes, we searched for epidemiologi -
cal studies which consider how potential barriers and 
enablers to positive language outcomes cluster within 
families. The resulting personae were based on work by 
Christensen and colleagues using latent class methods, 
which identified, six distinct clusters of family risks 
associated with differing vocabulary growth trajecto -
ries in a representative sample of 4000 Australian chil -
dren [70]. ‘Pen portraits’ of families representing each 
of the risk clusters described by Christenson et al. were 
developed using gender neutral names from a range of 
cultural heritages. Personae were developed only for 
use with practitioners; parents/caregivers were asked 
instead to reflect on their own experiences to maintain 
the validity of the insights gained as emerging from 
their own lived experience rather than any assumptions 
or generalisations about other family circumstances.Fig. 2 Simple Logic Model to guide intervention development
Page 8 of 26 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
Workshop materials were designed using the findings 
above and drawing on behaviour change and acceptabil -
ity theoretical frameworks [41, 51]. They aimed to elicit 
parent/caregiver and practitioner opinions regarding 
the acceptability of intervention target behaviours and 
techniques, and barriers and enablers for families with 
differing assets and challenges.
Stage 2 results
Table  3 lists the target behaviours and intervention tech -
niques extracted from the list of intervention papers. 
Multiple goals were targeted within complex interven -
tions falling broadly into three categories: responsive 
contingent interaction, shared book reading and focussed 
stimulation. Several intervention techniques were used 
including video feedback; multiple techniques were 
identified including video coaching, diary completion, 
environmental prompts (e.g. fridge magnet reminders), 
etc.. The persona ‘pen portraits’ are presented in Table  4. 
Workshop materials are available on request from the 
authors.
Stage 3 methods
Seven co-design workshops with 22 participants were 
facilitated by two members of the study team at each 
workshop (CM and either RW or SR). Practitioner work -
shops began with questions to understand the local 
pathway for children with speech, language and commu -
nication (SLC) needs. Parent/caregiver workshops began 
with an exploration of the participants’ motivation for 
attendance which also uncovered their experiences of the 
local pathway. A co-design activity was then completed 
which involved participants being presented in turn with 
the candidate target behaviours (e.g. shared book read -
ing) and intervention techniques (e.g. diary completion) 
identified in Stage 2 (Table  3). Barriers and enablers to 
and acceptability of adopting the target behaviour or 
implementing the intervention technique were then 
explored. Paper-based workshop materials were used to 
stimulate discussions and helped to scaffold and steer the 
topics covered. These materials were manipulated and 
annotated during discussions by the study team and par -
ticipants. All workshops were audio recorded. The above 
yielded the raw data for analysis: verbatim transcriptions 
of the workshops, annotated workshop materials, field 
notes and team reflections.
Methods for intervention development, described 
by Michie and colleagues and often referred to as the 
Behaviour Change Wheel and Capability, Opportunity, 
Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) models, were followed 
[41, 71]. These methods ensure a systematic, theory-
driven approach to intervention design providing meth -
ods and frameworks for (1) a thorough assessment of the behaviour to be targeted (the Behaviour in the COM-B 
model); (2) precise and detailed analysis of what is 
needed for individuals to change that behaviour (Capabil -
ity, Opportunity and Motivation factors); (3) identifica -
tion of the types of intervention functions and techniques 
which have proven efficacy in bringing those specific 
types of change about (Theoretical Domains Framework 
and Intervention Functions); and (4) determination of 
the best methods to implement those intervention func -
tions and techniques, whether that be through service 
provision, communication and marketing, fiscal meas -
ures, regulation, and so on (the Policy categories section 
of the Behaviour Change Wheel). A four-step deduc -
tive analysis was completed to (1) map identified barri -
ers and enablers and intervention techniques identified 
in the workshops and the research papers to the Theo -
retical Domains Framework (TDF) (e.g. Physical skills, 
Knowledge, Memory, Attention and Decision processes); 
(2) map the identified theoretical domains to candidate 
intervention functions (e.g. Training, Education, Envi -
ronmental Restructuring); (3) map the intervention func -
tion to candidate ‘policy categories’ , that are the candidate 
platforms through which a specific intervention function 
can be delivered effectively (for example, ‘Fiscal Meas -
ures’ may be appropriate for environmental restructuring 
function to reduce alcohol intake, ‘Communications and 
Marketing’ may be appropriate for Education to reduce 
smoking, and ‘Service Provision’ may be needed for train -
ing to increase physical activity); and (4) intervention 
functions identified as relevant to the TDF and barriers/
enablers but judged not to be appropriate to the interven -
tion context were discarded (e.g. Restriction, Coercion).
Field notes and team reflections identified that sev -
eral qualitative, socio-relational aspects of intervention 
delivery were being identified by participants as crucial 
to intervention success. Inductive analysis was there -
fore also completed to analyse the verbatim transcripts 
to identify themes which were not determined a priori, 
which emerged as important to intervention design.
Finally, a paper model of a proposed intervention was 
developed based on the identified intervention functions 
and policy categories. Judgement was used to determine 
which were the most relevant to the intervention. This 
judgement was informed by comments on acceptability 
from the co-design workshops at Stage 3, discussion with 
the wider team, knowledge gained of the contextual fac -
tors of importance through PPI, and themes of accept -
ability from the parallel study regarding parent/caregiver

Intervention type Behaviour(s) targeted by intervention Intervention techniques
Shared/dialogic book-reading Share an age-appropriate book with your child for 10–15 min per day for 5 or 
more times per week. While sharing the book
 1. Ask open questions like ‘where, who what……..’
 2. Avoid questions where your child might answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or just point
 3. When your child answers, follow up with another question
 4. Follow the child’s interests in the book
 5. Praise them for good answers and ideas
 6. Expand what the child says—so if they say ‘ball’ , you say ‘yes, a big ball’• You are given gifts of age-appropriate books
• You watch the Health Visitor show you how to share the book using the recom-
mended behaviours
• While you share the book using the recommended behaviours, you are videoed 
and then you and the Health Visitor look at the video together and see what you 
might change
• You attend a group at a community centre or library to work with other parents 
to learn the recommended techniques for book sharing—you watch videos of 
other parents sharing books with their child and discuss what they might change
• You are phoned weekly to see how you are doing
• You are given a leaflet describing the techniques to use when sharing books 
with your child
• You are asked to keep a diary of when, where and for how long you share a 
book with your child

Responsive/contingent interaction During every day activities and routines, you are asked to communicate with 
your child in a ‘responsive’ way by
 1. Following the child’s lead and interests
 2. Pausing and waiting to see what they are interested in
 3. Listening, watching and responding to their communication—these may 
be words, points, sounds or movements
 4. Describe what your child is doing
 5. If they say anything, imitate and expand what they have said—so if the say 
‘shoe’ , say ‘yes, that’s Molly’s shoe’
 6. Have fun, and show them you are having fun• You are given gifts of age-appropriate toys which will help you to follow their 
lead. You watch the Health Visitor show you how to play with your child using the 
recommended ‘responsive communication’ behaviours
• While you play with your child using the recommended ‘responsive communi-
cation’ behaviours, you are videoed and then you and the Health Visitor look at 
the video together and see what you might change

• You are given a leaflet describing the responsive communication behaviours to 
use when playing or in everyday activities with your child
• You are asked to set aside 15 min per day to practice this responsive communi-
cation and to keep a diary of when, where and for how long you manage to do 
this
• The Health Visitor explains to you how shared book reading benefits your child
• You have a wristband—like a fit bit—which records how much you say to your 
child and you get a daily report
• You and the Health Visitor make a plan together about the best times in the day 
and activities to practice this responsive communication
• You and the Health Visitor reflect on how things have gone this week and what 
you might change
• You are given fridge magnets to help you to remember how to be a responsive 
communicator with your child
• You are asked to teach a close family member how to be a responsive commu-
nicator and to support you
• Over the weeks you create a library of you and your child playing and communi-
cating to look back over and share with your family
• You are helped to identify resources in your local community where you can get 
help and advice, meet other parents and where your child can experience play 
with other children

Intervention type Behaviour(s) targeted by intervention Intervention techniques
Focussed stimulation 1) Work with a practitioner to choose a language goal for your child—this can 
be target sentences or target words.
2) Identify activities in the day to use that target sentence or target words with 
your child
3) Set up play activities to encourage your child to use the target words or 
sentences.
4) Ask your child to follow instructions and copy you saying these words or 
sentences.• You watch the professional show you how to play with your child using 
focussed stimulation
• While you play with your child using the recommended ‘focussed stimulation’ 
you are videoed and then you and the professional look at the video together 
and see what you might change
• You attend a group at a community centre or library to work with other parents 
to learn the recommended techniques for focussed stimulation—you problem 
solve how to create play situations to encourage certain kinds of words and 
sentences
• You are helped to plan games to play with your child to encourage certain kinds 
of words and sentences
• You agree goals to work on over the next two weeks—choosing games to play 
and how often to try them
• You are asked to think back and reflect on how well you have done over the 
past fortnight and think about things you might change
• You receive toys in the post with a newsletter explaining how to play to encour -
age certain target language structures appropriate for your child’s age

theoretical domains framework; the theoretical domains 
framework to the intervention functions; and the inter -
vention functions to the ‘policy categories’ . Table  6 pre -
sents the key finding from the deductive and inductive 
analyses and previous methodological stages which 
informed the development of a prototype intervention 
for further development and evaluation in Stage 5. These 
were
• Identified target behaviours for the intervention;
• Appropriate intervention contexts;
• Barriers and enablers to the targeted behaviour 
change which may exist across families;
• Candidate intervention functions;
• Candidate intervention delivery level/ policy catego -
ries;
• Factors for equitable, acceptable and practicable 
intervention delivery.
A paper prototype intervention was developed instan -
tiating these features into a proposed model for work -
shop purposes.
Stage 4 methods
Six co-design workshops were conducted with 33 par -
ticipants, facilitated by two members of the study team. 
Workshops at this stage involved a ‘walk through’ of the 
phases of the proposed intervention with paper ‘mock-
ups’ and descriptors of materials and processes. Work -
shop resources included triggers to comment on the 
acceptability and feasibility of the proposed model elicit -
ing suggestions as to how the phases should be presented 
and what materials should be used. The intervention 
model was refined and improved iteratively between 
workshops with modified materials presented at each site 
in light of previous workshop findings. Discussions were 
audio recorded, and participants manipulated and anno -
tated paper materials during discussions. Verbatim tran -
scripts of discussions were subjected to a content analysis 
to check and challenge the final model produced. The 
model was also ‘walked through’ with a subgroup of the 
study team part way through the participant data collec -
tion (CM, JL, VG, SR). Verbatim transcriptions were also 
analysed inductively to supplement the previous analysis 
regarding the qualitative aspects of intervention delivery 
which would be crucial to intervention success.
Stage 4 results
The following presents key learning from the phased 
methodology and a final intervention model derived 
through the synthesis of the evidence, and views of stakeholder and expert practitioners. We first report the 
finding of the inductive data analysis relating to two key 
themes: (1) Parent and practitioner views on the need 
for an intervention and (2) Key characteristics required 
for acceptable, equitable and practicable intervention 
delivery. We then present the final conclusions from the 
deductive analysis identifying (3) the acceptable target 
behaviours, contexts and intervention techniques; (4) the 
barriers and enablers to the identified behaviours across 
families and (5) the identified acceptable intervention 
functions and policy categories. Finally, we synthesise the 
above findings into (6) the final intervention model for 
practice and implementation.
Parent and practitioner views on the need for an intervention
Using NPT, the data from practitioners suggested that 
the PHE SLC ‘train the trainer’ programme was sup -
porting practitioners to do the work of coherence/
sense-making and participation/engagement which 
is required to embed speech, language and communi -
cation interventions into practices at the 2–2½-year-
old review. That is, practitioners had an appetite and 
indeed an enthusiasm to complete this work, see it is 
aligning with their role and skills and had ‘bought in’ 
to delivering interventions to support child language 
development. However, we found that the next step of 
enacting the intervention was difficult for practitioners. 
They were not sure precisely how to deliver support to 
families and discussions of the potential provision of 
concrete resources was welcomed.
Prac-WS7: “except we don’t have anything specific 
do we to show, that’s the thing. There’s nothing that 
I’m going to go back and I’m going to go in and I’m 
going to show this because that is what we do. There’s 
nothing set in stone that that’s what we use, is there? 
I think that’s probably a big problem because people 
are going back in, there’s not a definite this is a route 
we need to follow, is there really?”
Parents also articulated a desire to ‘get started’ to take 
action that would help their child. They expressed feel -
ings of helplessness, frustration and anger if they felt that 
nothing was happening, and their concerns were going 
unheard.
P-C-WS5: “because…you feel like something is hap -
pening which psychologically is good rather than, 
“We’ll wait a year and she’ll probably start speak -
ing….You can be proactive and do things. ”
P-C-WS2: “When they did his two year one, they 
didn’t say, “Come back in four weeks or two weeks, ” 
it was eight months so in that eight months we could 
Page 12 of 26 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
have got something started rather than making us 
just leave it this late” .
They emphasised however that provision of this inter -
vention must not introduce delays in referring children 
with severe difficulties and/or broader developmental 
concerns to SLTs and/or paediatricians/psychologists/
audiologists. Rather, it should allow those families to 
begin supporting their child immediately whilst waiting 
for specialist assessment if that were the appropriate next 
step.
P-C-W5:” As long as it’s made perfectly clear to them 
that they just can’t be left flailing around for two or 
three years like they have been……And listen to par -
ents because they know if something is wrong. ”
Key intervention characteristics necessary for success
Practitioner language and communication It is difficult 
to overstate the importance of the specific language used 
by practitioners to talk about children’s difficulties, and 
what parents/caregivers could do to help support their 
child. Language must be avoided which implies blame 
and judgement. If not carefully presented, advice can 
elicit strong negative feelings.
P-C WS3 : “might have thrown something at her to 
be honest”
P-C WS3: “you’ve done everything and you’ve read 
every book, every audio book and every study you can find online and someone says, “Have you tried 
talking to your child?” you just go, “I’m either going 
to breathe or lose it so I’m just going to go. ”
Communication should invite the parent/caregiver 
in as an equal in a process of shared decision-making, 
setting goals appropriate to the specific family. Experi -
enced and skilled practitioners invite parent/caregivers 
to express preferences, try new behaviours and feed -
back and problem solve together.
Prac-WS7: “it’s very much like they feel that you’re 
going in there to tell them they’re doing it wrong. 
It’s not about that. It’s about them learning the 
best way for them to do it themselves, isn’t it really. ”
P-C-WS3: I think if she’d said, “I’m sure you’re 
doing a brilliant job but here’s a couple of things 
you might not have thought about. You could just 
have a look at this list, it might give you a couple 
of pointers, ” rather than, “Right, well this is what 
you’ve got to be doing to make your child speak. Do 
you speak to your child?”
P-C-WS3: “I think a dialogue rather than just being 
told. A dialogue is good”
Alliance and trust between parent/caregiver and practi -
tioner Relationships of trust between practitioner and 
parent/caregiver were vital and, if not built at this stage, 
then continued engagement with the intervention and 
therefore its success are extremely unlikely. Facilitators 
of alliance and trust included demonstrating interest, 
engagement and expertise in interaction with the child Table 4 Descriptions of family ‘persona’ used to elicit practitioners implicit decision-making processes
Persona
Sam and Joe have 4 children. The child you are visiting has 2 older brothers and a younger sister aged 4 months. The family lives in social housing and 
receives benefits. Sam works full time in a bar near home. Joe works 2 or 3 h a week for a cleaning company. Joe and Sam both left school at sixteen. 
Most of their extended family live nearby. They try to manage their shifts so as not to have any additional childcare and call on family and friends.
Lee has two children under the age of 4; you are visiting the younger child. Lee left school at 16 years, is currently not working and is in receipt of ben-
efits. The family is living in a one-bedroom flat far away from Lee’s extended family. You are concerned about Lee’s mental health. When you observe 
the family, you feel Lee’s response to her children is very inconsistent, sometimes responsive and other times less so.
Alex and Lesley live in an estate of privately owned houses. Alex works full time as a head teacher at the local school, and Lesley is currently not work -
ing. They have two children, and you are visiting their youngest child who had low birth weight and spent a short time on SCBU. They are worried 
about their child’s behaviour. Her attention seems to flit from one toy to another, and she can be hard to manage if she does not get her own way. 
Lesley seems very distressed when describing day-to-day life.
Susie is a first-time parent who was pregnant when she left school. She is not in paid work and receives benefits. She lives with her parents in social 
housing. Her parents are also both long-term unemployed. She has a large community of friends and family nearby.
Ivory and Chidi have 5 children aged between 1 and 13 years, and you are visiting their second youngest child with an interpreter. Both Ivory and 
Chidi speak very little English and are currently not working. The estate where they live has poor transport links and few community services. You are 
concerned about Ivory’s mental health.
Nehal and Gurpreet both work full time: Nehal as a police officer and Gurpreet as an IT technician. You are visiting their first child. They have no 
extended family nearby and rely on a mix of a childminder and private nursery for childcare.

nership, dialogue, and shared decision-making; and con -
tinuity of support from the same practitioner over an 
extended period.
P-C-WS5: “because the number of times I’ve told my 
daughter’s story”
Continuity was also seen as being important in sup -
porting practitioners to make correct judgements as to 
the barriers and enablers which might exist for a fam -
ily’s ability to engage in responsive interaction and so to 
choose the level of support required.
Modelling  The role of modelling responsive interaction 
by the practitioner with the child was identified by both 
practitioners and parents. This modelling seems to fulfil 
several functions:
• Demonstrating the behaviour in a non-judgemental 
non-threatening manner P-C-WS3: Well I found it useful being shown, 
not being dictated to but being shown and not in, “I’m 
now going to show you how to talk to your child, ” but 
more just doing it naturally. You think, “Oh. ” I found 
that really useful… I think when you’re being told this 
is what you’ve got to do but when you see it and you 
see the way the child engages with it, you see how it 
works, whereas when you’re just being told, “Do this, 
do this, ” I don’t know, you’re butting your head against 
it a bit and you’re feeling a bit just shouted at.
• Demonstrating the value of specific responsive inter -
action behaviours and the potential for the child to 
engage and benefit from those behaviours
 Prac-WS7: “We model a lot of those kind of 
behaviours in the visit with the parents themselves 
but also with the children and then they see the child 
responding. Then they’re building their confidence up 
to do that themselves as well. ”

amazing, ”
• Promoting the parent/caregiver’s trust in the practi -
tioner
Modelling promoted trust as it demonstrated the prac -
titioner’s skills in engaging with the child; ensured any 
advice given was informed by the individual child’s tem -
perament, developmental level and needs; and facilitated 
joint and individualised problem solving.
Attractive and motivating resources The number of 
information sources and media which compete for par -
ents’ attention was mentioned several times. Practition -
ers identified the need therefore to design any messaging 
and intervention resources in a way which would capture 
the attention of parents and motivate them to engage.
Inclusiveness and accessibility Practitioners commented 
on how effective they found visual resources in other 
aspects of their practice. These included the use of video, 
attractive visual resources, ‘cue cards’ and visual remind -
ers. For inclusive and accessible practice, they empha -
sised that any physical resources must be ‘relatable’ 
and represent the range of families served by HV teams 
in England, require minimal literacy levels, be readily 
adapted to languages other than English and be designed 
to take account of the range of digital inequalities.
There was substantial variation across sites as to the accessi -
bility of sources of social support for families, such as parent 
and toddler groups, and opportunities for early childhood 
education and care (ECEC). Barriers to access included 
transport in more rural communities, recent reduction in 
local authority provision and confidence to attend, particu -
larly for more socially disadvantaged families, families who 
had concerns about their child’s behaviour and those from 
minority ethnic groups. The financial support for paid child -
care hours is also often difficult for families to navigate with 
some not being sure of how to access this.
Fit with current services For the intervention to be prac -
ticable and acceptable, it would need to fit into current 
service provision in terms of HV team models of care, 
early childhood education and care provision and also 
local onward referral pathways.
Tailoring If the intervention is not tailored to the indi -
vidual family and child, there is a substantial risk of it not being manageable for the family and of making them feel 
judged, patronised and/or set up to fail. The following 
explains how key components of the intervention (behav -
iours, contexts and intervention techniques) need to be 
tailored to the individual family’s context and preferences 
for them to engage with the intervention.
Acceptable target behaviours, contexts and intervention 
techniques
Behaviours Parents/caregivers and practitioners pre -
ferred an approach which would allow them to integrate 
any new behaviours into their everyday routine, rather 
than as an additional activity. Practitioners felt that the 
contingent responsive interaction behaviours (Table  4) 
aligned well with their current practice, underlying phi -
losophy and the messages which they provide at other 
reviews.
Prac-WS4: “It has to come with their own life and 
the way they are and how is that going to integrate 
into to their lifestyle so they can make the changes”
Prac-WS1: “it because part of your flow of conver -
sation rather than being told what to do. We talk 
about responsive feeding, we talk about responsive 
parenting. That word responsive comes in”
There were substantial differences across parents in 
which responsive behaviours they felt they needed/
wanted to try to do more frequently. It was also impor -
tant that any goal was perceived to be focussed and 
manageable.
Prac-WS4: I think it feels big….it needs to be broken 
down
Prac-WS4: “But it’s about choosing one or two things 
and not too many things…I think giving them too 
much and bombarding them with too many things… ”
Prac-WS1: “it’s something they already do, and 
you’re not asking them to do too much. They’re not 
overwhelmed. ”
Contexts Importantly, jumping too quickly to a spe -
cific context within which to practise these behaviours 
risked alienating families. For example, when consider -
ing shared book-reading interventions, families reported 
multiple ways in which this context could cause prob -
lems. This included parent/caregivers’ perception that it 
suggested that they might not know book reading was a 1 All names in quotes are pseudonyms.

good idea, which felt patronising, or that they did not do 
enough book reading, which felt judgemental.
P-CWS1: “I’d be quite offended because I read a lot 
with my kids. We had this and they said, “Mum, you 
need to read with them. ” I read with them quite a lot. 
I do at least four books on a night …. Then they’re 
saying, “Read with them. That’s why he doesn’t, you 
just have to read…. Yes, like it’s our fault”
Furthermore, if book reading felt too difficult for the 
parent/carer either because the child was not ready or they 
themselves had some literacy difficulties, this would likely 
feel too difficult and that it was setting them up to fail.
P-C-WS1: “Everything needs to be the way Danny 
likes. If I want to read a book to Danny, no, because he wants another book. If you’re reading a book to 
Danny, he’s like, “That’s enough. ” He has enough with 
the book so it’s just like…I don’t want to be shout -
ing all the time, “Danny Sit down, Danny. ” I’m like, 
“You know what? I’m just going to let Danny when 
he wants it, ” because I don’t want to frustrate him”
P-C-WS1: “So to be honest, I’m not very good at 
reading books but my husband has a little bit more 
patience with the language because it’s not my lan -
guage so for me to read, I need to take… a lot of 
times. ”
Other parents would very much welcome support with 
how to share books with their child:

a  Of specific relevance to families where there is a need to tackle barriers with respect to physical and social opportunitiesTarget behaviours for the intervention Use a chosen responsive interaction behaviour for 10–15 min 
every day from the following list:
 • Get down to your child’s level
 • Follow your child’s lead and interests
 • Pause and wait for your child to show you what they are 
interested in
 • Listen, watch and respond to their communication—this can 
be words, points, sounds or movements
 • Describe what your child is doing or looking at—imagine 
what they are thinking and feeling and say that
 • Show them you are having fun, and use an interesting voice
 • If they do communicate, copy what they say or mean to say, 
and add a word
 • Try to use fewer questions, and instead describe what is 
happening.
 • When you do ask questions try to keep them open—where,

a sheet with questions on it, that would help a bit 
more. ”
It was clear that different families needed and preferred 
different contexts to practice the chosen intervention 
behaviours.
P-C-WS5: “ I just built it into my day all the time 
really at the moment, when we had a moment….I 
just worked it in wherever we were. ”
“On the flip side, for me, having multiple children I 
wouldn’t be able to work it into my daily because it’s 
just mental sometimes….but for me, this would be 
brilliant because I would go, “Actually yes, I do need 
to find a time in my day to focus and that will be my 
time. That will be when the others are in the bath, 
dad is bathing them. He can bath Ella and Jack and 
I will sit on the sofa with Archie. ”
Prac-WS4: “I think it’s the time when they are 
together that is the critical time. It’s making the most 
of that together time”
Intervention techniques In terms of intervention 
techniques extracted from previous research and dis -
cussed in the workshops (Table  4), most were felt to be 
acceptable if their implementation could be adjusted 
to the family’s context, if explained appropriately, and 
if delivered in the context of a relationship of trust 
between the parent/caregiver and the practitioner. 
The exceptions (techniques which were considered 
not acceptable) included the parent/caregiver being 
videoed by the practitioner; the use of a ‘language fit 
bit’ which records how much the parent says to the 
child and gives a daily report; and teaching another 
family member how to be a responsive communicator. 
The former two bringing with them a power dynamic 
which was not welcomed by many families and a sense 
of being ‘surveilled’ and the latter raising significant 
difficulties with respect to family dynamics and differ -
ence of opinion as to how best to parent between part -
ners and across generations.
Barriers and enablers
The work above identified the target behaviour for the 
intervention: parents/caregivers increasing the frequency 
of use of one or more of set of responsive interaction behav -
iors. The barriers and enablers to the use of responsive 
interaction language-promoting behaviours in the home 
identified in Stage 3 are synthesised and summarised in 
Table 7.Intervention functions and ‘policy categories’
We further examined the barriers and enablers identi -
fied above together with the intervention techniques 
drawn from the literature which participants judged to 
be acceptable and feasible to identify the most relevant 
intervention functions and policy categories to be used in 
the intervention (see Table  5). These were mapped to rel -
evant intervention functions, and Training, Enablement, 
Modelling, and Persuasion were identified as the most 
relevant functions. The main policy categories/platforms 
for delivery identified as relevant to our shortlist of inter -
vention functions and theoretical domains were Service 
delivery and Communications and Marketing suggest -
ing a combination of implementation approaches across 
health/educational services and marketing would be ben -
eficial (Table 5).
The proposed intervention
The proposed intervention aims to empower families to 
act to support their child as soon as the risk of SLCN is 
identified, applying current best evidence in a timely 
manner. It aims to ensure equity of access for all chil -
dren and families through tailored guidance and support 
(Fig.  3). The intervention does not replace local SLCN 
pathways but rather is designed to become coordinated 
with and integrated into them. It is essential that children 
continue to be referred for support by SLTs and other 
professionals where they meet local criteria for referral 
and receive enhanced support in their early years settings 
as appropriate.
The steps in intervention delivery are as follow:
• Step 1: Preparation
• Step 2: Decide on the need for intervention and/or 
onward referral
• Step 3: Choose intervention level
• Step 4: Choose a responsive behaviour to do more 
often
• Step 5: Choose the context in which to practice the 
behaviour for 10–15 min daily
• Step 6: Deliver tailored support
• Step 7: Offer optional additional support
Step 1 focusses on the preparation, which is neces -
sary for successful shared decision-making and engage -
ment [53, 72]. In order to address power imbalances in 
the practitioner–parent/caregiver relationship [18] and 
‘activate’ the parent/caregiver [73], preparatory materi -
als are needed which welcome and value the parent/car -
egiver’s knowledge about their child, establish the focus 
of the review [72] and encourage the parent/caregiver to 
arrive with questions and reflections. Step 2 is essential in 
mobilising and motivating action by the parent/caregiver 
Page 19 of 26
 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
 
and creating practitioner–parent/caregiver alliance [36]. 
Steps 3–5 focus on shared decision-making and goal set -
ting. Steps 6 and 7 relate to intervention delivery. The 
proposed procedures, content and materials of each 
intervention stage including recommendations regard -
ing the language to use and methods of presentation are 
described in detail in Supplementary Materials2.
The intervention model and its components The goal 
of the intervention is to increase parents/caregivers’ use 
of specific responsive interaction behaviours for 10–15 
min per day in a specific context, which suits the family’s 
resources and constraints and is part of their usual daily 
routine.
The intervention delivery platforms draw on the identi -
fied relevant policy categories of Service Delivery and 
Communications and Marketing. All families receive 
one of three levels of support through HV services (Ser -
vice Delivery) and links to a universal media and social 
media campaign (Communications and Marketing) (i.e. 
resources already published or under development by 
the Best Start in Life program: ‘Hungry Little Minds’ [74] 
and ‘Tiny Happy People’ [75]). Two optional additional 
support packages may also be offered (see Fig.  3). Which 
level families receive and whether the optional additional 
support is offered is determined by the outcome from 
the ELIM-I measure (developed as part of this study and 
reported elsewhere) and also practitioner judgement as 
to the assets and challenges for the family and the barri -
ers and enablers to accessing the intervention—a judge -
ment which is guided by resources and training based 
on the COM-B model and Theoretical Domains Frame -
works [41, 42] (see below).
Level 1: children with no identified risk
We recommend the framing of this review as a time to 
talk about setting the foundations for the child’s learning 
and ensuring all children reach their full potential [24, 
76]. As such, all families should be signposted to available 
resources which provide guidance as to how to support 
children’s language development. This universal provi -
sion of accessible information potentially brings three 
key benefits. First, we know that trajectories of language 
development can be unstable and unpredictable between 
2 and 4 years of age, and some children who appear to 
be developing well at 2 years may develop language dif -
ficulties later [32]. By ensuring all families are provided 
with appropriate resources to support them to provide 
an enriching language environment, we provide a ‘safety 
net’ for those who may not be identified at this review. 
Second, parents/caregivers’ perception of the value of the 2–2½-year review and their subsequent engagement with 
services is partly influenced by whether they learn some -
thing new at that appointment [32]; guidance on child 
language development could meet these preferences. 
Third, taking a universal rather than targeted approach 
brings an additional advantage of reducing the potential 
for stigmatisation which can be inherent in some tar -
geted interventions. Targeted selective approaches offer 
intervention to groups who are more likely than others 
to develop a particular condition. In the case of language 
interventions, this is usually families living with social 
disadvantage. Such approaches carry the risk of uninten -
tional stigmatisation and consequential disengagement of 
targeted groups [77]. This can be avoided where families 
see that the support is universally offered albeit with var -
ying intensity according to need.
Level 2: children with identified risk—self-directed 
approach
This level of support is for children identified as being 
at risk of SLCN using the ELIM and where practition -
ers judge there are few barriers to the targeted behaviour 
change. Where barriers do exist, the practitioner judges 
they mainly relate to the Capabilities category of the 
COM-B model (Table  7). If the child meets the criteria 
for SLT referral for the local pathway then this should be 
actioned. Practitioners discuss the need to support their 
child’s language development and the nature of respon -
sive interaction. Language is carefully chosen which pro -
motes the building of trust and engagement and avoids 
implications of blame or judgement (see Supplementary 
Materials 2). Using a shared decision-making tool, prac -
titioners support families to choose a responsive interac -
tion behaviour which they would like to try to do more 
often and identify the context and times in the day when 
they will be able to try this—their ‘Together Time’ .
Detailed guidance is provided for the practitioner about 
each step (see Supplementary materials). This includes 
suggestions for how to support parents to sustain and 
adjust their interactions including review and reflection 
techniques, recording and aide memoire strategies (see 
Supplementary materials 2 for more detail).
Level 3: children with identified risk—coaching approach 
with additional practitioner support
This pathway is for children identified as potentially 
being at risk of SLCN using the ELIM and where prac -
titioners judge there are a number of barriers to the tar -
geted behaviour change, particularly in the Motivation 
and/or Opportunity categories of the COM-B model 
Page 20 of 26 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
(see Table  7). This level uses similar approaches as level 
2 above but with additional face-to-face support from the 
practitioner to tackle motivation and opportunity barri -
ers to change and offer more support for knowledge and 
skills development. This support takes the form of coach -
ing through modelling, practice and supported reflection 
and goal setting, with the practitioner offering regular 
visits until the parent/caregiver is confident they can 
integrate the behaviour into their daily routines (see Sup -
plementary materials 2 for more detail).
Optional additional support package 1—access to early 
years settings/social support
An optional additional support package should be 
offered to families with barriers to behaviour change 
identified with respect to social opportunities and physi -
cal resources necessary for those social opportunities (see Table  6). Design and delivery of a support package 
to facilitate access to social opportunities will require 
knowledge regarding local provision and the community 
assets and resources, that can be mobilised. Action by the 
practitioner alone is not sufficient if local provision is not 
accessible to all families.
Optional additional support package 2—access to age-
appropriate books and play materials
The responsive interaction behaviours targeted in this 
intervention do not require the provision of any specific 
play materials or toys. Indeed, the goal of the intervention 
is to support families to integrate responsive interaction 
into their usual daily routines. In general, no additional 
toys or children’s books are likely to be required. How -
ever, in some cases, where the family identifies ‘playing 
with toys’ or ‘sharing books’ as their preferred ‘together Table 7 Enablers identified as needing to be in place to engage in the target behaviour change (increase frequency of responsive

time’ and where the family resources are extremely lim -
ited, practitioners should consider a support package to 
address access to toys and books. This may involve sup -
port to access toy libraries and the local library. As in the 
case of ECEC provision, many barriers to access to these 
resources exist.
We recommend local co-design of both support packages 
to identify barriers and enable access to parents and tod -
dler groups, playgroups, local libraries and toy libraries 
for families who need this support: those with social and 
physical opportunity barriers (see Table  6). Co-design 
work should involve all agencies involved with early years 
provision, those practitioners who signpost families to 
them and parents/caregivers and may include the devel -
opment of resources to support families to use everyday 
materials available at home to develop play and language.
Media and social media campaign
Our analyses identified that in addition to the service 
delivery approaches we have described above, that the 
policy category ‘Communications and Marketing’ was 
also a relevant platform for delivery of support. Existing 
social media resources from the ‘Hungry Little Minds’ 
and ‘Tiny Happy People’ [33, 75] campaigns align closely 
to this intervention model. There was, however, a sense of being overwhelmed from some practitioners we spoke 
to in terms of the range and sheer volume of materials 
whilst others were not aware of the ‘Tiny Happy People’ 
campaign. There was an identified need from practition -
ers for help to navigate the resources and identify which 
might be best for which purposes. Both parents and prac -
titioners suggested many families will not seek this infor -
mation out and, in some cases, may be uncomfortable 
with a perceived ‘educational’ tone. The use of a range of 
social media platforms and active campaigns were sug -
gested as being necessary if these messages are to reach 
all families of young children. We therefore recommend 
‘joining up’ of this intervention with existing resources 
and social media campaigns so that the materials devel -
oped in this intervention clearly signpost to the high-
quality resources being developed.
Skill-mix, delivery and normalisation
Steps 1–5 of this model (encompassing preparation, 
identification, tailoring and shared goal-setting) require 
a holistic approach to both child and parent health and 
wellbeing and knowledge of the family and so we recom -
mend that the HV take the lead at these stages. The pro -
vision of tailored support and additional support pack -
ages (Steps 6 and 7) could involve a more mixed model 
with skill mix in HV teams or Early Years Practitioners in Fig. 3 The proposed intervention model
Page 22 of 26 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
early years settings delivering the tailored support and/
or the optional additional support packages in consulta -
tion with the HV team. For those families where coach -
ing and additional support packages are required (Level 
3) Speech and Language Therapy services could also be 
involved either directly or as advisors to the practitioners 
delivering the coaching model, depending on the config -
uration of the local SLCN pathway. This should be nego -
tiated and discussed as part of the local co-design work 
we recommend above which will be required to develop 
implementation and sustainability plans for integration 
into local service delivery context. We recommend that 
for implementation and maintenance of this programme 
of work that an integrated team of HVs, SLTs and Early 
Years leads is convened and maintained to steer its intro -
duction and safeguard its sustainability [60, 61].
Discussion
This paper presents the findings of a rigorous interven -
tion development methodology to design a universal 
intervention to promote children’s language development 
to be delivered at the HV 2½-year review. The study 
applied the most recent guidance on best practice in 
intervention design and co-design [34, 35, 44, 45] and 
was informed by relevant theory with respect to early 
language development and disorders [22, 46], behaviour 
change [41], shared decision-making [53, 55], engage -
ment [36], acceptability [41, 51] and implementation [35, 
61].
The resulting intervention (ELIM-I) focusses on 
supporting families to increase their use of respon -
sive interaction behaviours [22, 46] within their daily 
routines and in contexts tailored to individual family 
circumstances [53, 55]. The risks of universal interven -
tions widening rather than narrowing inequalities was 
addressed through consideration of the differing barri -
ers and enablers which may be present for families [41]. 
The intervention was therefore designed to offer families 
a proportionate and tailored response—proportionate 
in that the intensity of support can increase or decrease 
depending on the family’s needs—and tailored such that 
the goals and intervention approaches are modified con -
sidering the specific assets and challenges in each family. 
The resulting intervention therefore meets a core princi -
ple of the modernised Healthy Child Programme—Best 
Start in Life: ‘universal reach and a personalised response’ 
[33]. Families differed significantly as to where the bar -
riers lay to changing the targeted behaviour and in their 
daily routines and demands on parent/caregiver time. 
Many published interventions focus on specific behav -
iours (e.g. shared book reading) [16] or on the devel -
opment of knowledge and skills, and do not consider factors of motivation (such as feelings of self-efficacy and 
confidence to succeed) or social or physical opportuni -
ties [19, 78]. Interventions which are not tailored to the 
specific barriers and enablers present for each are likely 
not only to be ineffective, but also risk alienating fami -
lies and damaging the potential for engagement with ser -
vices [36]. Inappropriate advice risks families feeling 
blamed, judged, patronised, or set up to fail [79]: how an 
intervention is delivered can ‘make or break’ its success. 
This intervention therefore draws on theories of shared 
decision making, patient activation and engagement and 
partnership, to embed strategies which engender suc -
cessful collaborative partnership in its design [53, 55]. 
Although these characteristics are often viewed as core 
to HV practice [80], our findings suggest families do not 
always experience them and, as a result, sometimes rela -
tionships break down.
Perhaps most important to this alliance is the language 
used by practitioners to talk about children’s difficul -
ties, and what parents/carers could do to help support 
their child. Concrete, shared decision-making tools can 
scaffold practitioner–patient conversations to enable 
communication which addresses power imbalances, 
acknowledges families’ strengths and invites equal par -
ticipation [55, 80]. Implementation will likely also require 
training in the use of the tools advocated here [59]. We 
also recommend the use of preparatory materials for 
‘patient activation’ prior to attendance at the review 
appointment which can go some way to addressing 
power imbalance and hence promote dialogue [53, 73]. 
Particular care must be taken that discussions with par -
ents/carers do not imply that their interaction style or the 
time they spend interacting with their child has caused 
the language difficulties they are experiencing. It can 
be difficult to understand and to explain that although 
changing  your interaction style can improve your child’s 
language development that your interaction style has not 
caused  their language difficulties [81, 82].
The views of both practitioners and parents suggest 
any intervention must maintain their sense of agency, 
enabling practitioners to provide a responsive service 
and for parents to begin to address the needs of their 
children. It was very clear that any such support for 
the family must not create a delay to access to more 
specialist Speech and Language Therapy Support for 
children with more severe difficulties and/or signs of 
broader developmental concerns. The degree to which 
SLT and HV services are ‘joined up’ and have agreed 
and clear co-working and referral pathways varies sub -
stantially across the UK. To deliver ELIM-I and support 
all children’s language development in a given local -
ity, it is clear that collaboration between these services 
is vital. Further ‘joining up’ is required to tackle the 
Page 23 of 26
 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
 
identified barriers of physical and social opportunity, 
which are best addressed through access to Early Child -
hood Education and Care Settings, particularly those 
which focus on the provision of support for the family 
as whole. Again, access to these varied across our sites, 
a picture mirrored across the UK reflecting the reduc -
tion in spending on early preventative services in 2010 
and the move away from universal provision to more 
targeted approaches [83]. Successful delivery of the 
ELIM-I intervention would necessarily require com -
missioning and service delivery to be integrated across 
all the different professionals involved—health visitors 
and their teams, speech and language therapists and 
early years practitioners. This integration  work also 
fulfils the NPT process of enacting wherein the innova -
tion becomes material practice through practitioners’ 
operationalising the innovation into their own specific 
context, increasing the potential for it to become nor -
malised practice [60].
Strengths and limitations
This study followed recent guidance for successful inter -
vention development. The iterative methodology served 
to integrate current best evidence with stakeholder 
preferences and rich contextual information regard -
ing the context within which the intervention would be 
delivered. Extensive stakeholder engagement and co-
design workshops across a diverse range of sites served 
to inform the final intervention design. The advent of 
COVID-19 restrictions in the last phase of data collec -
tion meant that our parent/caregiver participant sam -
ple was not as diverse, in terms of linguistic and cultural 
backgrounds as we would have hoped. In the next phase 
of piloting and implementation of the ELIM-I, it will be 
essential to ensure the views and experiences of a broad 
demographic of families are solicited.
This study delivered detailed guidelines for the deliv -
ery of the ELIM-I intervention. Superficially, the ELIM-I 
intervention is a simple one: supporting parents/caregiv -
ers of children at risk of speech language or communica -
tion needs to increase their use of responsive interaction 
behaviours with their child. However, the need for pro -
portionality, tailoring and collaborative partnerships 
makes successful delivery to the requisite level of fidel -
ity for intervention effectiveness a complex task. Quality 
improvement, especially across complex, multi-profes -
sional, multi-agency systems, is rarely easy. Innovation, 
such as the development of the ELIM-I is only the first 
step. For successful implementation of this innovation to 
be achieved, further development and scientific evalua -
tion are required, and clearly, further studies to pilot it in 
a range of contexts and evaluate its efficacy are essential 
[60, 84].Next steps
Embedding health care and educational innova -
tions into routine practice is not straightforward and 
requires explicit planning [61]. Applying NPT, our 
work identified that SLC training for HVs has and is 
supporting practitioners to do the work of coherence/
sense-making and participation/engagement which is 
required to embed SLC interventions into practices at 
the 2–2½-year-old review. That is practitioners have 
‘bought in’ to delivering interventions to support child 
language development. However, the next NPT step 
required for successful and sustainable implementa -
tion, that is enacting the intervention, remains difficult. 
Whilst the ELIM-I protocol provides further guidance, 
it is yet to be tested in practice, and, in its current form, 
as guidance rather than as material objects and/or local 
policy, there are risks with respect to its potential for 
successful implementation [84, 85]. Efforts must focus 
on the NPT stages of enacting and appraisal if the inno -
vation is to be sustained and delivered across contexts 
with the required level of fidelity to the original pro -
tocol for the potential benefits to be realised [60, 61]. 
Practitioners are likely to require additional support 
and resources to enable the ELIM-I to be implemented 
successfully and in a manner which will narrow rather 
than widen inequalities through offering truly propor -
tionate and tailored support appropriate to each family. 
This would include intervention materials, including 
preparatory letters, shared decision-making tools, 
video modelling resources, aide-memoires, etc., for 
use with a range of families and communities; train -
ing resources to ensure HV teams have the appropri -
ate skills to model contingent responsive interaction 
and can make appropriate judgements regarding tai -
loring; and audit and reflection tools to enable ongoing 
appraisal and hence maintenance of the innovation in 
practice.
Further work is also needed for ELIM-I to be accessible 
to families from a range of linguistic and cultural back -
grounds. We recommend further work to develop and 
pilot a manualised program with standardised interven -
tion resources and guidance for local implementation 
and policy development. Strategies to support successful 
implementation with proven efficacy include the devel -
opment of simple, evidence-based, accessible and visu -
ally clear and appealing resources; the use of decision 
support systems, checklists and digital tools, and con -
text-specific standardised protocols [86]. Furthermore, 
multi-professional collaboration and the development 
of local consensus groups have been shown to improve 
implementation [87, 88].
The response of services to the COVID-19 pandemic 
have underlined the diversity in service provision which 
Page 24 of 26 McKean et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:35 
exists across the country for children in the first 1001 
days and the benefits which can be realised when early 
years settings and HV services collaborate to support 
vulnerable families [89]. Furthermore, the DfE is ambi -
tious to leverage the skills, knowledge, and capacity of the 
whole children’s workforce to give children the ‘Best start 
in Speech Language and Communication’ . To date the 
ELIM-I development has focussed, in the main, on HV 
teams. Whilst the key principles of the ELIM-I are likely 
to readily translate to early years settings its implemen -
tation must be contextualised. Further work is needed to 
adapt the ELIM-I for use in early years settings to facili -
tate inter-agency collaboration.
A fundamental shift for services during the pan -
demic has been the move to remote support using 
digital tools. There is an acknowledgement amongst 
professionals and families of both benefits and harms 
from this shift. For some families, remote services are 
welcomed as convenient, lower cost and accessible 
whilst for others, the ‘digital divide’ makes them com -
pletely inaccessible. Importantly, for families with the 
highest level of need, remote services do not support 
the necessary development of professional and parent–
caregiver trust and alliance for successful support to 
be delivered [89].
Digital remote delivery therefore will never be a pana -
cea for service delivery to support families of children 
in the early years. However, within a matrix of differing 
tailored support, digital delivery offers the potential for 
convenient and economical delivery for some families, 
potentially freeing up resource for face-to-face support 
for those with the greatest need for specialist practi -
tioner support. Development of methods to deliver 
ELIM-I digitally therefore could bring potential benefits 
with respect to further tailoring and personalised care, 
and possible cost savings. In addition, they ensure ser -
vices are robust to future pandemic or other ‘shocks’ to 
services for children and families and have the potential 
to enable multi-disciplinary collaboration.
Conclusions
It is possible to develop a universal intervention for use 
by HVs at the 2–2½-year review to promote children’s 
language development which parents and practition -
ers judge would be acceptable and feasible in practice. 
For such an intervention to be equitable and to promote 
engagement and partnership, it must be proportionate, 
varying in intensity of support, tailored, such that goals 
and intervention approaches address the specific barriers 
and enablers in each family, and must address power rela -
tionships through shared decision-making, patient acti -
vation and strength-based approaches.Abbreviations
