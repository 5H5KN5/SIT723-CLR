Abstract
Objective— Sexual activity often begins in early adolescence, and adolescents with mental health 
symptoms are at greater risk for sexual activity and other health risks. This study aimed to evaluate 
a developmentally targeted intervention designed to enhance early adolescents’ emotion regulation 
competencies as a strategy for reducing health risk behaviors, including sexual initiation.
Method— Adolescents 12 to 14 years old ( N = 420; 53% male) with mental health symptoms 
participated in either an Emotion Regulation (ER) or Health Promotion (HP) intervention 
consisting of twelve after-school sessions. Participants completed questionnaires on laptop 
computers at baseline, 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.
Results— Time to event analyses were used to compare intervention conditions on rate of 
initiation to vaginal sex. Results showed that participants in the Emotion Regulation (ER) 
condition were less likely to transition into vaginal sexual activity by one-year follow-up than 
those in the Health Promotion (HP) condition (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.94, 
p = .01). However, those who were sexually active did not report differences in sexual risk 
behaviors (e.g., condomless sex). Participants in the ER condition were significantly less likely to 
report violence behaviors and showed improvement on a behavioral measure of emotion 
identification, however they did not differ from HP participants on self-reports of emotional 
competence.
Conclusions— Emotion regulation strategies can be used to delay sexual initiation among early 
adolescents with mental health symptoms and may have an important role in health education.

While sexuality in adolescence is a normative aspect of human development that has 
potentially positive consequences, it can also have negative ones. Data suggest that sexual 
intercourse in early adolescence is associated with significantly greater future sexual risk. 
Those who have sex before age 15 are more likely to engage in sexual risk as they age (e.g., 
more sexual partners, sexually transmitted infections (STIs)) than their peers who begin 
having sex at older ages ( Capaldi, Stoolmiller, Clark, & Owen, 2002 ; Magnusson, Masho, & 
Lapane, 2012 ; Sandfort, Orr, Hirsch, & Santelli, 2008 ). They are seven times more likely to 
have multiple unintended pregnancies ( Magnusson, Masho, & Lapane, 2011 ) and twice as 
likely to test positive for a STI at age 18 ( Kaestle et al., 2005 ). Therefore, delaying sexual 
intercourse may have important health benefits throughout adolescence.
Early adolescence is an important time to intervene around values, cognitions, and emotions 
related to sex. Cognitions about sex change before adolescents engage in sexual behaviors 
(O’Sullivan & Brooks-Gunn, 2005 ), and sexual values and intentions in early adolescence 
are predictive of behavior in middle adolescence ( Stanton et al., 1996 ). The relationship 
between positive feelings about sex and sexual initiation is strongest when adolescents are 
younger ( Romer & Stanton, 2003 ), and these attitudes change more dramatically in early 
adolescence than mid-adolescence ( O’Sullivan & Brooks-Gunn, 2005 ). Intervening early is 
therefore critical to targeting sexual values, cognitions, and feelings before they are well 
established.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  surveys indicate that, depending on the state, 
between 6.5% and 19.4% of middle schoolers report ever having had sexual intercourse 
(http://nccd.cdc.gov/youthonline ). Because of the relative infrequency of intercourse in this 
developmental period, and given the relationship between delay and the prevention of sexual 
risk outcomes (fewer partners, STIs, and later pregnancies), intervening on sexual delay is an 
important risk marker to impact among this population. Some group interventions for middle 
school youth have successfully targeted such delays ( Tortolero et al., 2010 ; Coyle, Kirby, 
Marin, Gomez, & Gregorich, 2004 ; Jemmot, Jemmot, & Fong, 2010 ) by addressing 
knowledge, values, or behavioral skills such as communication or condom use. However, 
relatively little attention has been paid to intervening around feelings associated with sexual 
behavior ( Jenkins, 2014 ; Bell & McBride, 2010 ) despite their importance in several 
theoretical models of risky decision making (e.g., Slovic, Peters, Finucane, & MacGregor, 
2005 ; Tice, Bratslavsky, & Baumeister, 2001 ). Intervention approaches focused on values or 
skills may be incomplete without attention to the emotions (and their regulation) that 
influence how adolescents respond to potentially risky situations. Research suggests that 
when people experience high levels of negative emotion, they act impulsively to decrease 
this distress, prioritizing short-term soothing over other self-regulation strategies ( Tice, 
Bratslavsky, & Baumeister, 2001 ). Consistent with this, poor emotion regulation in 
adolescence has been linked to risky health behaviors, including more sex partners ( Hessler 
& Katz, 2010 ) and more substance use ( Wills, Walker, Mendoza, & Ainette, 2006 ).
Emotion regulation is conceptualized as the process of “shaping which emotions one has, 
when one has them, and how one experiences or expresses these emotions” ( Gross, 2014 , 
pp. 6). Targeted emotions are often negative, though positive emotions can also require 
regulation, as when excitement or attraction to a partner leads to sex, and both emotional Houck et al. Page 2

states have been associated with adolescent sexual behavior ( Fortenberry et al., 2005 ). Teens 
who engage in risk, such as condomless sex or substance use, are more likely to report 
difficulty with emotion regulation ( Brown et al., 2012 ). These relationships have also been 
demonstrated longitudinally; studies show that self-regulation of emotions and behavior in 
early adolescence is associated with sexual risk taking and substance use in later 
adolescence ( Hessler & Katz, 2010 ; Raffaelli & Crockett, 2003 ). In the context of research 
connecting emotions to sexual behavior among adolescents ( Houck et al., 2014 ; Shrier, 
Koren, Ancja, & de Moor, 2010 ), these relationships may exist because adolescents’ 
difficulties with emotion regulation increase the likelihood of impulsive self-soothing 
behaviors, such as sex. Interventions targeting emotion regulation in times of sexual decision 
making may assist young people in delaying onset of sexual activity ( Brown et al., 2013 ).
Early adolescents with emotional and behavioral symptoms may be particularly vulnerable 
to deficits in emotion regulation when making decisions about sex. These symptoms are 
related to more sexual activity among early adolescents ( Hipwell, Keenan, Loeber, & 
Battista, 2010 ; Schofield et al., 2008 ) and with sexual risk as teens get older ( Brooks, Harris, 
Thrall, & Woods, 2002 ; Elkington, Bauermeister, & Zimmerman, 2010 ). Mental health 
symptoms can signal difficulties in emotion regulation skills, which may represent a path 
that places adolescents at risk for engaging in early sexual activity or other risk behaviors.
To examine the impact of teaching emotion regulation strategies on risk behaviors among 
early adolescents who may be at risk due to mental health problems, Project TRAC (Talking 
about Risk and Adolescent Choices) was developed. The model of adolescent risk behavior 
used to guide its development was The Social-Personal Framework ( Donenberg et al., 2005 ), 
which emphasizes the coaction of individual and social factors for risk. The model proposes 
that adolescent sexual risk-taking is a function of the interplay of: 1) personal attributes; 2) 
peer and partner relationship concerns; 3) environmental conditions; and 4) family context. 
Emotion regulation represents a key personal attribute that may contribute to adolescent 
sexual behavior, and this represented the focus of the intervention. The most widely used 
and supported model of emotion regulation ( Webb, Miles, & Sheeran, 2012 ) is Gross’ 
process model ( Gross, 2014 ). The process model identifies five families of emotion 
regulation strategies: situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, 
cognitive change, and response modulation. Via these strategies, individuals can target 
emotion management at various points in the process of emotional experience (e.g., 
attending to a stimulus, appraising a stimulus). A meta-analysis of experimental studies of 
emotion regulation (primarily adult studies) demonstrated that strategies such as distraction 
and reappraisal have positive effects on emotional outcomes ( Webb, Miles, & Sheeran, 
2012 ), suggesting these approaches may be useful in real-world situations.
The developed intervention was conducted as a small group, after school program, in which 
participants were provided with emotion education and skill building focused on emotion 
regulation strategies for use in health risk situations, with an emphasis on sexual health. In 
an evaluation of the short-term outcomes immediately following the intervention, 
participants in the Emotion Regulation (ER) condition reported fewer health risk behaviors 
during the approximately two-month intervention period relative to those in a general Health 
Promotion (HP) condition ( Houck et al., 2016 ). Adolescents in the HP condition were 2.5 Houck et al. Page 3

times more likely to be sexually active than those who were taught emotion regulation 
strategies. HP adolescents were also significantly more likely to report violence-related 
behaviors (carrying a weapon and fighting), suggesting that adolescents in the ER condition 
may have generalized the principles taught to reduce other health risks. Indeed, ER 
participants reported using emotion regulation strategies when emotionally aroused more 
often than those in the HP condition.
While these immediate risk reductions are important and support the link between emotion 
regulation and risk, program impact on delaying engagement in risk over longer periods has 
even greater public health implications. The purpose of the current study was to assess the 
impact of the ER condition on the primary target, delay of vaginal sex initiation, at one-year 
follow-up. It was hypothesized that ER participants would be less likely to transition to 
vaginal sex over the one-year follow-up than those in the HP condition that did not contain 
emotion education. In addition, based on the short-term findings, it was hypothesized that 
ER participants who had engaged in vaginal or anal sex would report fewer risk behaviors 
than those in the HP condition. It was also hypothesized that the intervention effects may 
generalize to violence and substance use behaviors. Finally, it was expected that ER 
participants would perform better on measures of emotional competence (e.g., identifying 
emotions, self-reports of using regulation strategies).
Method
Participants
With institutional review board approval, 420 7th graders were recruited from five urban 
New England public schools between September 2009 and February 2012. Adolescents were 
eligible if they were in 7th grade, aged 12–14 years, spoke English, and were at-risk due to 
symptoms of emotional or behavioral problems or suspected sexual or substance use 
behavior. A form developed by one of the school districts, used for school staff to make 
counseling referrals, served as a guide to school personnel (e.g., counselors, administrators, 
nurses) for making referrals to program staff. It included common symptoms of emotional or 
behavioral concerns, such as hyperactivity, withdrawing, declining grades, erratic behavior/
mood swings, or disruptive behavior. Students who were known to have a history of being 
sexually aggressive, be HIV-infected, have developmental delays, be currently pregnant, or 
have a sibling who had previously participated in the program were excluded. Exclusion 
criteria were re-assessed with parents prior to consent to confirm eligibility. Of note, 
symptoms of common internalizing and externalizing disorders of adolescence were 
assessed at baseline (after consent and assent) via seven selected subscales from the 
adolescent-report Youth Inventory-4 (YI-4) and parent-report Adolescent Symptom 
Inventory (ASI; Gadow & Sprafkin, 1995 ), screening instruments for child and adolescent 
psychiatric disorders based on DSM-IV . Seventy percent of participants had a T-score of 65 
or greater on at least one subscale by either adolescent or parent report (Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (any type): 52%; Conduct Disorder: 27%; Oppositional Defiant 
Disorder: 26%; Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 23%; Major Depressive Disorder: 38%; 
Dysthymic Disorder: 44%; Bipolar Disorder: 39%).Houck et al. Page 4

Figure 1 details participant retention. About 1,283 students were attending seventh grade in 
the five schools each of the three study recruitment years (3,849 students). About 27% of 
students were referred to the program; this is consistent with national data ( Merikangas et 
al., 2010 ) that indicate that 22.2% of adolescents have a mental health disorder causing 
severe emotional or behavioral symptoms (this study required only symptoms of a disorder). 
Forty percent of referred students enrolled in the study. Additional details regarding Project 
TRAC procedures, recruitment, and retention have been previously published ( Houck et al., 
2016 ).
Overall, the sample ( N = 420) was 53% male, with a mean age of 13.0 years (SD = .55). The 
sample was 32% Caucasian, 28% African-American, 2% American Indian/Alaskan Native, 
3% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 1% Asian and 18% multiple endorsements (16% did not 
endorse a race). The sample was 38% Latino, and 30% of parents reported a family income 
< $20,000 (18% did not endorse an income).
Interventions
Adolescents participated in either an Emotion Regulation (ER) or Health Promotion (HP) 
intervention condition; both were developed and piloted using focus groups with early 
adolescents during a pilot study (R34 MH078750). Each manualized intervention consisted 
of twelve, twice-weekly, hour-long sessions, run in single-gender groups of 4 to 8 
adolescents. Booster sessions reviewing intervention content were offered for both 
conditions after participants completed questionnaires at 6 and 12 month follow-ups. 
Delivered in schools after the school day, groups were led by male-female pairs that 
included a mental health clinician (or clinician in training) and a research assistant. Both 
interventions used the same teaching techniques that relied on interactive games adapted to 
teach core concepts (e.g., quiz games, Jenga), as well as group discussions and workbook 
activities to personalize information learned. ER condition sessions were generally divided 
into two halves: emotion regulation education (e.g., recognizing feelings in self, strategies 
for reducing momentary arousal) and sexual health (e.g., puberty, STIs). Each session in the 
HP condition addressed a single topic (e.g., nutrition, smoking) and did not include emotion 
education or relate health decision making to emotions. Participants received $2 for being on 
time for each session, awarded at the end of the program.
To reduce contamination and avoid nesting conditions within schools, schools participated in 
one condition each school year. Participating schools were organized by grade, therefore 7th 
graders generally had limited contact with 8th graders. The five schools were randomly 
assigned to an order of conditions over two school years (i.e., ER in Year 1, HP in Year 2 or 
HP in Year 1, ER in Year 2); schools were re-randomized for the third year of recruitment.
Emotion regulation intervention— The ER intervention aimed to enhance ER skills to 
reduce poor decision making that can lead to unplanned sex or other health risk behaviors, 
such as substance use or physical aggression (see Table 1). The first half of the program 
presented the relationship between emotions and behaviors as well as emotion education, 
such as identifying emotional arousal in oneself through somatic cues, labeling these 
feelings, and recognizing their sources (“triggers”), such as feeling embarrassed or pressured Houck et al. Page 5

by partner requests for a sexual behavior. The second half taught developmentally 
appropriate strategies for regulating emotions (both positive and negative) during moments 
of decision making. Three strategies, identified during qualitative work in the development 
stage of the program, were presented: 1) getting away (physically or cognitively) from 
triggers for strong emotions, 2) releasing emotional energy in healthy ways (verbally or 
physically), or 3) changing cognitions and appraisals about emotional triggers. Referred to 
in the intervention as “Get Out,” “Let It Out,” and “Think It Out,” these strategies include 
four of the five “families” of ER processes in Gross’ process model: situation modification, 
attentional deployment, response modulation, and cognitive change. The fifth, situation 
selection, was discussed as a way to prevent experiencing dysregulated emotions, but was 
not emphasized because the unique focus of the intervention was on managing emotions as 
they occurred (instead of suggesting that adolescents prevent them in the first place).
Games and role plays were used to apply these strategies to a variety of risk situations. The 
program also presented connections between emotion regulation and peer relationships, 
media representations, and substance use. Given the focus on sexual risk, adolescents 
received sexual health education, including information about sexual development, STIs 
(including HIV), and disease/pregnancy prevention, which included positive discussion of 
youth engagement in non-penetrative sexual behaviors as an alternative to those more likely 
to involve fluid exchange.
Health promotion intervention— Loosely modeled after a comparison condition 
developed for another project ( Brown et al., 2013 ), the aim of HP was to encourage healthy 
decision making through information on a breadth of topics, similar to the structure of many 
public school health education curricula. The HP intervention was matched for time and 
used similar activities to address topics such as substance use, internet safety, violence, 
nutrition, exercise, sleep, and cigarette smoking. The sexual health content of the ER 
intervention was also included, with modifications to eliminate discussion of emotions 
related to decision making.
Curriculum Training and Fidelity
A treatment manual was used to maintain treatment fidelity. Facilitators were trained 
through live, mock groups, practiced for each of the sessions. Project investigators annually 
directed these trainings, in which facilitators role played activities, discussed session goals, 
practiced behavior management, and discussed issues of fidelity to treatment delivery. 
Facilitator-completed adherence ratings demonstrated excellent (98%) adherence to the 
manual. Senior project staff observed 15% of sessions, which also indicated excellent (97%) 
adherence.
Data Collection and Measures
The current study used data from assessments completed at baseline, immediately after the 
intervention (posttest), 6 months post-baseline, and 12 months post-baseline. Data from the 
immediate posttest were used only for providing information for time to sexual initiation; 
short-term effects of the intervention have been published elsewhere ( Houck et al., 2016 ). 
Adolescents completed an audio-assisted computer self-interview (ACASI). Parents also Houck et al. Page 6

completed baseline demographic and adolescent symptom questionnaires on laptops in the 
language of their choice (English, Spanish, or Portuguese). Participants received gift cards 
for completing assessments.
Sexual activity— The primary outcome of the study was time to vaginal sexual activity. To 
assess this, participants were asked at each assessment whether they had ever engaged in 
vaginal or anal sex. Those responding yes were asked more detailed questions about their 
sexual behavior in the last 6 months, including whether this was the first time they had 
vaginal sex, and if so, in which of the past 6 months their first time had occurred. 
Adolescents were also asked whether they had engaged in anal sex in the last 6 months, 
though not whether this was the first time. Those who endorsed vaginal or anal sex in the 
last 6 months were asked about number of sexual partners, number of vaginal and/or anal 
sex acts, and the number of times condoms were used (to calculate a proportion of acts 
protected by a condom). The abbreviated posttest was simplified to whether participants had 
had vaginal and anal sex since beginning the program. Behavioral definitions were used to 
ensure that participants understood vocabulary; definitions did not reference gender of 
partner so as to allow for both opposite- and same-sex encounters.
Other risk behaviors— Secondary behavioral outcomes of interest included substance use 
and violence behaviors. Substance use was assessed via four items that assessed frequency 
of use of alcohol, marijuana, inhalants, and “other drugs,” separately. Responses were 
summarized to whether participants had used any substance in the past 6 months or not. 
Similarly, to assess violence behaviors, two items adapted from the Youth Risk Behavior 
Surveillance System ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009 ) were used to assess 
the frequency of carrying a weapon to school or physical fighting in the past month. 
Information was dichotomized to identify those who had engaged in either form of 
aggression and those who had not.
Emotional competence— The Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy – 2 
(DANV A2; Nowicki & Carton, 1993 ) was administered at baseline, 6-months, and 12-
months. The DANV A is a computer task that asks participants to identify the emotional 
expression conveyed through a series of photographs (Faces). The DANV A has shown one-
month test-retest reliability over .8 ( Nowicki & Carton, 1993 ). Adolescents completed two 
self-report subscales of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & 
Roemer, 2004 ), in which statements of emotional competence were rated on a 5-point scale 
(1=almost never to 5=almost always). The Lack of Emotional Awareness subscale (LEA; 6 
items) assessed self-perceived emotional awareness (e.g., “I pay attention to my feelings”). 
Higher scores indicate greater problems with awareness. The Limited Access to Emotion 
Regulation Strategies subscale (LAERS; 8 items) evaluated perceived abilities to manage 
negative emotions (e.g., “When I’m upset, I believe that there is nothing I can do to make 
myself feel better”). Higher scores indicate greater problems with accessing regulation 
strategies. The DERS has been previously validated in adolescent samples ( Neumann, et al., 
2010 ; Weinberg & Klonsky, 2009 ) and demonstrated strong reliability in the current sample 
(at baseline, LEA α= .88, LAERS α= .83).Houck et al. Page 7

Adolescents completed the 8-item Emotion Regulation Behaviors Scale (ERBS; Houck et 
al., 2016 ), created for the study to assess use of the specific emotion regulation strategies 
taught in the ER intervention. Using a scale of 1 (“never”) to 5 (“all of the time”), teens 
responded to items such as “In the last week, when you were having a strong feeling (for 
example, really mad, really sad, or really excited) how often did you …get away from 
whatever was causing your feeling? …think about the situation differently?” Higher scores 
indicate more frequent use of the strategies taught. Internal consistency at baseline was .73 
and at both 6- and 12-months was .85.
Statistical Analyses
Nesting of participants within schools— To account for participant nesting within the 
five schools, school was included in all statistical models as a categorical covariate.
Missing data— Depending on the outcome measure, missing data ranged from 1% to 5% 
at baseline, 8% to 14% at 6-months, and 12% to 17% at 12-months. There were no 
differences between conditions in number of participants who missed either the 6-month or 
12-month assessment (ER: 14% [ n = 31]; HP: 16% [31], χ2(1) = 0.12, p = .73). Participants 
who missed tended to be older than those with complete data ( F(1,417) = 7.98, p < .01), with 
no other differences on baseline characteristics. Consequently, age was included in all 
statistical models, and multiple imputations ( Su, Gelman, Hill, & Yajima, 2011 ) were used 
for all analyses to address potential bias due to dropout.
Imbalance in baseline characteristics— In accordance with current recommendations, 
propensity scores were used to adjust for potential imbalance between conditions on 
demographics, sexual behavior, violence, substance use, and emotional competence ( Austin, 
& Stuart, 2015 ; Austin, 2014 ). Specifically, we used inverse probability of treatment 
weighting where the probability for being in the treatment condition was estimated for each 
participant by regressing treatment condition on all demographics and baseline 
characteristics. These probabilities (i.e., propensities) were then used to generate weights for 
each participant following procedures outlined in Austin (2014) . These weights were then 
used in all statistical models, effectively adjusting for potential imbalance between 
conditions.
Delay of sexual initiation— A Cox-proportional hazard model was used to test 
differences between the ER and HP conditions. Time in months from beginning the study to 
the first vaginal event was calculated for every participant. Participants who reported vaginal 
sex prior to the beginning of the study (HP = 12%, n = 24, ER = 9%, n = 20; χ2(1) = 0.75, p 
= .39) were not included in the analysis. The Cox-proportional hazard model can 
accommodate censoring in the data (i.e., drop-out before sexual initiation; HP = 10%, n = 
18; ER = 11%, n = 21; χ2(1) = 0.06, p = .88) so long as the drop-outs are comparable to 
those who remained in the analysis. In a test of this assumption, those who were censored 
were more likely to come from a home with annual household income less than $20,000 
(χ2(1) = 6.92, p = .01), with no other differences on baseline characteristics. Consequently, 
household income was added as a covariate to the Cox-proportional hazard model, with Houck et al. Page 8

baseline age and school. Missing data in household income was addressed using multiple 
imputations following procedures by White and Royston (2009) .
Risk and emotional competence outcomes— Logistic regressions were used for 
dichotomous data and analyses of covariance were used for continuous data. All models 
included participant school, participant age, and the baseline assessment as covariates. 
Sexual risk outcomes were modeled with the following differences. Models were only run 
for those who reported ever having vaginal or anal sex prior to the assessment of interest. 
Due to the small number of youth reporting vaginal or anal sexual activity, baseline 
assessments were not included as covariates.
Mediation— Causal mediation models ( Imai, Keele, & Tingley, 2010 ) were run to evaluate 
the extent to which changes in each of the emotional competency outcomes mediated the 
proportion of youth ever endorsing vaginal/anal sex at 6 and 12 months. Proportion of the 
total treatment effect attributable to treatment-related change in the mediator was evaluated 
for each model. The following R packages were used to run the analyses: ‘mi v1.0' ( Su, 
Gelman, Hill, & Yajima, 2011 ); ‘stats’ ( R Core Team, 2014 ); and ‘MASS’ ( Venables & 
Ripley, 2002 ); ‘survival’ ( Therneau & Grambsch, 2000 ); ‘mediation’ ( Tringley, Yamamoto, 
Hirose, Keele, & Imai, 2014 ).
Results
Baseline characteristics
There were no significant demographic differences between the Emotion Regulation (ER) 
and Health Promotion (HP) conditions. The conditions did differ in the number of 
participants reporting substance use at baseline (Table 2; χ2(1) = 7.09, p < .01), with no 
other significant differences on baseline measures of risk behavior. There was no significant 
difference between conditions on attendance at the 12 after school sessions (9.1 vs. 9.0), 
t(418) = 0.20, p = .84 or on attendance at the 6-month booster session (46% vs. 44%), χ2(1) 
= .16, p = .69). After weighting the conditions by the inverse treatment probability, there 
were no significant differences between conditions on any of the baseline characteristics.
Delay of sexual initiation
From baseline to the 12-month assessment, 42 participants in the HP and 35 in the ER 
reported initiating vaginal  sex for the first time. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for both 
conditions are depicted in Figure 2. The hazard ratio for the difference between conditions 
indicated that after controlling for school, family income, and baseline age, participants in 
ER were significantly less likely than those in HP to transition into vaginal sexual activity 
(adjusted hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.94, p = .01).
Risk and emotional competence outcomes
Descriptive information about risk behaviors and emotional competence outcomes is 
reported in Table 2 and tests of differences between conditions in Table 3. Controlling for 
school and baseline age, there were differences between conditions in the number of 
participants who reported either vaginal or anal sex (lifetime) at both the 6-month (adjusted Houck et al. Page 9
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
odds ratio [AOR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.40 to 0.84) and 12-month (AOR 
= 0.54, CI = 0.37 to 0.80) follow-ups. Among those who had had vaginal or anal sex, there 
were no other differences between conditions on risk behaviors.
Controlling for school, baseline age, and the baseline assessment, there was a significant 
difference on the violence risk composite at the 6-month (AOR = 0.66, CI = 0.44 to 0.98) 
but not 12-month follow-up. There was no difference between conditions on the substance 
use composite at either follow-up. There was a significant difference between conditions on 
the DANV A at the 6-month follow-up (unstandardized estimate [b] = 2.91, CI = 0.29 to 
5.52), with the ER condition outperforming the HP condition, but this difference was no 
longer present at the 12-month follow-up. There were no differences between conditions on 
the ERBS or either of the DERS subscales.
Mediation
All emotional competency outcomes were evaluated as mediators of the proportion of youth 
ever endorsing vaginal or anal sex at 6 and at 12 months. Consistent with analysis of 
treatment effects reported in Table 3, treatment-related change in DANV A faces accounted 
for 9.32% (CI = 1.24 to 16.12) of the treatment effect at 6 months and 10.65% (CI= 4.07 to 
17.04) at 12 months. No self-report measures of emotional competence were significant.
Discussion
Extending previous findings of the short-term efficacy of an emotion regulation intervention 
for early adolescents, the current study found that participants in the ER intervention who 
had not had vaginal sex at baseline were significantly less likely to have done so one year 
later than their counterparts in the HP intervention. These results are consistent with 
previous studies documenting a relationship between emotion regulation and risky health 
decision making ( Brown et al., 2012 ; Hessler & Katz, 2010 ). This provides further support 
for the inclusion of emotion education in the context of health education as a mechanism 
critical to influencing decision making. Knowing strategies for monitoring emotions and 
managing strong feelings is key to achieving emotion regulation goals ( Gross, 2014 ). In this 
case, it may help young people calm strong feelings at times of risk (such as sexual 
possibility situations), allowing them to integrate knowledge and values into their decision 
making and reduce the chance of making decisions based solely on feelings (or their 
avoidance).
These results for a program developed specifically for early adolescents in public schools 
with mental health symptoms are consistent with two sexual risk prevention programs that 
included emotion regulation components for older adolescents with more severe mental 
health problems. While neither examined transition to sex, both demonstrated that those who 
received emotion regulation training reported fewer sexual risk behaviors at 1-month ( Brown 
et al., 2013 ) and 6-month ( Brown et al., 2011 ) assessments. The present study found similar 
behavioral benefits of focused emotion regulation interventions on reducing targeted sexual 
behavior. Furthermore, it extended the length of the observed effect to 12 months, suggesting 
that earlier intervention with such strategies may have greater impact than waiting until later 
in development. However, it should also be noted that the lower level of severity with regard Houck et al. Page 10

to mental health symptoms in the current sample compared with those in the previous 
studies may also explain why the intervention sustained its effect on transition to vaginal 
sexual activity.
However, significant differences were not observed on other behavioral outcomes among 
those who were sexually active, such as having multiple partners or engaging in condomless 
sex. Due to the relatively small numbers of adolescents who were sexually active by the one-
year follow-up (eighth grade), the study was underpowered to detect such effects. Greater 
ability to detect these differences may emerge as more adolescents become sexually active 
over longer term follow-up periods. Alternatively, it may be that those adolescents who were 
sexually active in the developmental period of this study may have differed from other teens 
in key characteristics that made them less responsive to the intervention. Finally, it may be 
that adolescents associated the message of emotion regulation more strongly with whether or 
not to have sex than with sexual safety.
Consistent with short-term findings that demonstrated intervention benefits related to 
violence behaviors ( Houck et al., 2016 ), youth in the ER condition reported fewer violence-
related behaviors at the six-month follow-up. This result is encouraging, as it suggests that 
the learning of emotion regulation strategies focused on sexual risk appears to have 
continued to generalize to other risk behaviors thought to be influenced by emotion 
regulation. However, this effect did not maintain to one year and was not observed for 
substance use outcomes. It may be that more concrete examples connecting emotion 
regulation to other specific risk behaviors are necessary to maintain changes in violence 
behaviors for a longer period of time or affect substance use.
While teens in the ER condition showed behavioral differences on emotion recognition and 
the primary target outcome of the study, sexual initiation, their self-reports of emotional 
competence did not differ between groups nor mediate treatment effects. Despite earlier 
findings that adolescents in the ER condition reported more frequent use of emotion 
regulation strategies during the intervention, this effect was not observed over longer follow-
ups, nor did the groups perceive themselves as different in emotional awareness or in their 
ability to regulate their emotions. It is possible that the self-report tools used did not assess 
the emotional constructs by which this intervention had its impact. It may also be that these 
adolescents’ abilities to describe their emotional competence, while reliable, may not be 
highly valid during this period of development, due to limits in abilities to recognize and 
label their own emotional experiences that might be more common among youth with 
mental health symptoms.
It is noteworthy that, in contrast to findings on self-reports, intervention differences were 
observed over time on a behavioral task of identifying feelings in others. This is one 
important skill for emotion regulation in social situations, such as sex, and these changes 
mediated the group differences in reports of vaginal or anal sex at both 6- and 12-month 
follow-ups. This objective, skills-based assessment indicated that ER youth improved in 
emotion identification following the intervention; HP adolescents remained generally stable 
in their performance. These data provide preliminary support that assessment strategies that 
do not rely on self-report may detect intervention effects in emotional competence that are Houck et al. Page 11

difficult for adolescents to recognize and that improvements in emotional competence relate 
to differences in sexual activity.
Strengths of the study include an innovative target for prevention (emotion regulation) with a 
challenging population (early adolescents with mental health symptoms) that was racially 
and ethnically diverse. The program used a strong comparison condition that employed the 
same engaging intervention style and sex education content rather than treatment as usual 
(i.e., “standard” school health education) or an attention control focused on a nonsexual 
health topic, which are most often used ( Picot et al., 2012 ). Internal validity was further 
enhanced by excellent participant retention and rigorous training and supervision to ensure 
treatment fidelity.
There are also limitations. Most of the measures were self-report and are thus subject to 
potential bias; however, the use of ACASI to collect sensitive information is believed to 
increase honest reporting ( Romer et al., 1997 ). Generalizability is limited by the fairly 
narrow age range, the emphasis on youth with mental health symptoms, and the single 
geographic region from which the population was drawn. This study also did not collect 
information regarding adolescents’ sexual identities, and fidelity ratings of intervention 
delivery lack inter-rater reliability. Finally, despite randomization, participants in the HP 
condition reported more risk behaviors at baseline than adolescents in the ER condition, 
however, lack of balance was addressed using propensity score methods.
This project had a one-year impact on reducing the transition to vaginal sexual activity 
among at-risk youth with mental health symptoms, which is notable in the adolescent risk 
prevention literature. It successfully recruited and engaged vulnerable youth at-risk due to 
mental health symptoms from public school settings, a population that can be difficult to 
reach. This suggests that early adolescents with multiple stressors are interested in programs 
addressing emotion education provided those programs are developmentally tailored. The 
addition of formal education about emotions and their role in decision making may be a key 
element to transforming current health education for early adolescents, particularly those 
who have symptoms of emotional and behavioral difficulties. By acknowledging the 
emotional context in which risk decisions are made and providing strategies for regulating 
these emotions, adolescents may have a better chance of using the facts that currently form 
the emphasis of health education in public schools. Future directions for research should 
include better understanding the influence of emotions on risk behavior as well as 
determining populations that can benefit most from such interventions.
