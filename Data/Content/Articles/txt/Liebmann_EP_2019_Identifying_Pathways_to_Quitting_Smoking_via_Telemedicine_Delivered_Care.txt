Abstract
Objective: A randomized controlled trial of quitline-like phone counseling (QL) versus 
telemedicine integrated into primary care (ITM) compared the effectiveness of these modalities for 
smoking cessation. Study design and components were based on Self-Determination Theory 
(SDT). The purpose of this study was to test our SDT-based model in which perceived healthcare 
provider autonomy support, working alliance, autonomous motivation, and perceived competence 
were hypothesized to mediate the effects of ITM on smoking cessation.
Methods: Rural smokers (560) were randomized to receive 4 sessions over a 3-month period of 
either QL or ITM. Follow-up assessments were conducted at months 3, 6, and 12. The primary 
outcome was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence at 12-months. Structural equation 
modeling with latent change scores was used for the analysis.
Results: Participants in the ITM condition reported greater increases in perceived healthcare 
provider autonomy support (PAS) at end of treatment, which in turn was associated with enhanced 
perceived competence to quit smoking (PC). Increased PC was associated with a higher likelihood 
of cessation at 12-months. Mediation analysis demonstrated significant indirect effects, including a 
path from ITM to increases in PAS to increases in PC to cessation at 12-months (Indirect effect = 
0.0183, 95% CI [.003, .0434]).
Conclusions: When integrated into primary care, ITM may influence smoking cessation by 
enhancing the extent to which smokers feel supported by their providers and thereby increase their

Introduction
Tobacco use causes approximately 5.4 million deaths a year worldwide (World Health 
Organization, 2012). Although the prevalence of smoking has declined dramatically over the 
past 40 years in the U.S.( Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 2006 ), adult smoking rates in 
rural areas remains above 20% ( Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015 ).
This may be due, in part, to the fact that our health care system does a poor job of delivering 
evidence-based tobacco treatment to rural smokers. FDA-approved cessation medications 
double to triple the odds of quitting ( Fiore et al., 2008 ) and supportive counseling doubles 
quit rates in the range of 4 sessions of treatment and is more effective at higher “doses” 
(Fiore et al., 2008 ). Primary health care providers, however, consistently fail to provide 
tobacco treatment. In 2015, only 57% of smokers reported that a health care provider 
advised them to quit ( Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 2017 ). Among smokers who made 
quit attempts, 6.8% reported using counseling, 29.0% medication, and 4.7% used both 
(Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 2017 ).
Two significant approaches have emerged with potential to increase the provision of tobacco 
treatment by rural health care providers. One method is through tobacco quitlines which are 
used in conjunction with fax referral to improve the efficiency of providing longitudinal 
supportive counseling. Nearly all (49) state quitlines offer fax referral systems, in which 
health care providers identify tobacco users and then fax to quitlines the contact information 
for consenting patients who will receive their tobacco cessation behavioral care from the 
quitline ( North American Quitline Consortium, 2008 ). The other method of care provision is 
through telemedicine. Telemedicine is the use of telecommunications for medical diagnosis 
and patient care across a distance and is often used to provide medical care to patients in 
remote locations ( Scannell, Perednia, & Kissman, 1995 ). Broadly defined, telemedicine 
encompasses video, telephone, text message, and even website-focused approaches. A 
Cochrane review of interactive telemedicine-delivered care found that telemedicine was as 
effective as usual care in the treatment of heart failure and substance use disorders, and was 
more effective than usual care in achieving blood glucose control ( Flodgren, Rachas, 
Farmer, Inzitari, & Shepperd, 2015 ). A Cochrane review of telemedicine versus face-to-face 
patient care for a numerous health issues found that telemedicine was as effective as face-to-
face treatment and achieved high levels of satisfaction among patients and providers 
(Currell, Urquhart, Wainwright, & Lewis, 2000 ). At the time of the trial many rural Kansans 
lacked sufficient internet speed and computer equipment to handle video transmissions, but 
most primary care and safety net clinics had the ability to transmit video. This drove the Liebmann et al. Page 2

decision to examine the effects of real-time, interactive video counseling, delivered via 
patients’ medical homes, on smoking cessation.
Given the potential of both phone and telemedicine to be used for tobacco treatment it is 
unclear whether there might be advantages of one over the other. Long-term quit rates for in-
person face-to-face counseling (17%) are somewhat higher than those reported for telephone 
counseling (13%) ( Fiore et al., 2008 ). In face to face interactions counselors may benefit 
from patient non-verbal cues that could help to improve the quality of communications. For 
example face to face interactions allow for observation of facial reactions and body language 
that can facilitate the judgement of affect or engagement ( Foley & Gentile, 2010 ). With 
visual awareness of the patient’s reactions to the counseling process the counselor may 
better understand the patient’s perspective and provide more accurate reflective statements 
and information. Telemedicine software can also facilitate the sharing of documents such as 
action plans, worksheets, or educational materials targeted to the needs expressed by the 
patient in the counseling session. By fully integrating counselor/patient verbal and visual 
communication, telemedicine may therefore overcome numerous limitations of phone 
counseling. Patients may consequently experience an enhanced therapeutic relationship.
A recent randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT)—Connect2Quit—compared the 
effectiveness of telemedicine counseling that was integrated into rural smokers’ primary care 
clinics (Integrated Telemedicine—ITM) versus telephone counseling, similar to telephone 
quitline counseling, delivered to smokers in their homes (QL) ( Mussulman et al., 2014 ). 
Based on principles of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and psychotherapy research on the 
importance of the therapeutic alliance for counseling outcomes ( Lambert & Barley, 2001 ; 
Orlinsky, Ronnestad, & Wilutzski, 2004 ; Williams, Gagne, Ryan, & Deci, 2002b ) it was 
hypothesized that ITM would outperform telephone counseling. In the pre-specified primary 
outcome analysis of the trial we found no difference between ITM and QL conditions in 
rates of 12-month verified abstinence (9.8%, 27/280 vs 12%, 34/286; p =.406), average 
number of cigarettes per day ( p = .721), or quit attempts ( p = .347) ( Richter et al., 2015 ).
Although the primary outcome analyses yielded findings contrary to our hypothesis we also 
pre-specified treatment targets or mediators hypothesized to influence smoking behavior. 
Incorporating and evaluating the role of hypothesized mediators in clinical trials is 
recommended for more precise interpretation of the results ( Czajkowski et al., 2015 ). We 
primarily used Self-determination Theory (SDT) as a basis for our mediation model. SDT 
posits that when practitioners provide information and resources in a way that patient’s 
perceive supports their autonomy, patients internalize motivation for change, view 
themselves as competent to change, and are more likely to achieve lasting behavior change 
(Deci & Ryan, 1985 ). Important elements of autonomy-supportive counseling include 
listening carefully to patients perspectives, providing relevant information, inviting 
questions, offering treatment options, supporting patient attempts at behavior change, and 
minimizing control ( Williams, Gagne, Ryan, & Deci, 2002a ). This type of intervention leads 
to increased autonomous motivation, increased competence, and behavior change ( Deci & 
Ryan, 1985 ). SDT has been effectively used in many clinical settings, for numerous health, 
mental health, and behavioral outcomes ( Deci & Ryan, 1985 , 2002 ; Williams et al., 2002c ), Liebmann et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
including smoking cessation ( Williams et al., 2006 ; Williams, Niemiec, Patrick, Ryan, & 
Deci, 2016 ).
In addition to the SDT framework we incorporated the construct of therapeutic alliance into 
our mediation model. Therapeutic alliance is an inherent aspect of counseling (i.e., 
independent of the counseling approach) and is well established as a key predictor of 
therapeutic outcome including smoking behavior ( Ahn & Wampold, 2001 ; Klemperer, 
Hughes, Callas, & Solomon, 2017 ). Therapeutic alliance encompasses the bond between the 
counselor and patient as well as their agreement on methods and goals of treatment 
(Lambert, 2016 ). Previous research has observed a positive association between therapeutic 
alliance and autonomous motivation ( McBride et al., 2010 ). Thus, it is expected that facets 
of ITM that are hypothesized to promote autonomous motivation may also promote 
participant-rated therapeutic alliance. In addition to a collaborative relational style, the 
theoretical conceptualization of therapeutic alliance has been expanded to reflect the idea 
that the quality of the working relationship depends upon the ease with which therapeutic 
ruptures and disagreements are resolved ( Doran, 2016 ). Given that telemedicine may 
facilitate the judgement of affect through the presence of visual cues, it is possible that ITM 
may allow for more rapid identification of tension or disagreement. Relative to telephone 
counseling, this enhancement may allow for the more rapid resolution of difficult moments 
in counseling thereby promoting, or maintaining, alliance.
Figure 1 depicts the conceptual model of how we hypothesized SDT constructs and 
therapeutic alliance would facilitate smoking cessation in the context of ITM. We 
hypothesized that ITM would create a stronger therapeutic alliance and better facilitate the 
counselor’s ability to offer autonomy-supportive counseling. Although we trained 
counselors in both phone and ITM to use an autonomy supportive communication style, we 
hypothesized that ITM would facilitate more supportive counseling interactions than phone 
counseling because of the availability of visual cues and the facilitation of information 
exchange targeted to expressed patient needs. We also hypothesized that because ITM 
sessions were located in primary care offices, providers would be more likely to address 
smoking cessation informally or formally with the patients in that study condition. We 
hypothesized that the patients in ITM would therefore be more likely to perceive that their 
health care provider supported them making an attempt to quit than patients who received 
counseling over the phone at home. We further hypothesized that this might lead to greater 
perceived autonomy support from their provider even though the provider was not directly 
engaged in counseling. This was predicted to result in greater perceived competence and 
autonomous motivation for quitting and in turn an increased likelihood of quitting.
The aim of this study was to conduct a secondary analysis to evaluate this SDT-based 
conceptual model to further our insight into the effects of telemedicine and quitline phone 
counseling for smoking cessation and better interpret the results of our clinical trial.Liebmann et al. Page 4

Methods
Study Design
The design of this study (Connect2Quit) has been published previously ( Mussulman et al., 
2014 ). The study enrolled 566 smokers who were recruited through 20 primary care clinics 
throughout the state of Kansas from June, 2009 through June, 2011. Six participants died 
during the course of the study and thus were excluded from the present analysis (n = 560). 
Participants were recruited through radio, community health fairs, religious organizations, 
and businesses. Participants were randomly assigned to the ITM and QL conditions, 
respectively. Four counseling sessions occurred at weeks 0, 1, 4, and 8. Follow-up 
assessments were conducted at months 3, 6, and 12. The reimbursement schedule for the 
study was $20 at baseline, $20 at 3 months, $20 at 6 months, and $50 at 12 months. 
Participating primary care clinics received $1,000 for incidental costs related to the study 
and a computer and PVX software used to implement the ITM intervention. The University 
of Kansas Medical Center approved all study procedures. Written informed consent was 
obtained from each study participant prior to enrollment in the trial.
Eligibility
Eligible participants were required to have a physician participating in the study, be 18 years 
or older, smoke 5 or more cigarettes per day for at least one year, smoke 25 or more days out 
of the past 30, speak English or Spanish, and have a telephone. Exclusion criteria included 
using non-cigarette tobacco products, currently taking smoking cessation products, currently 
breast feeding or planning to get pregnant, planning to move in the next year, not having a 
healthcare provider, or living with a current study participant ( Mussulman et al., 2014 ).
Intervention
Study staff-delivered components.— In the week following enrollment, all participants 
received a mailed packet of educational materials on smoking cessation, a timeline of study 
activities, and individualized information on appropriate quit smoking medications given 
insurance and medical status. Participants were randomly assigned to either the ITM or QL 
treatment conditions.
Participants in the ITM condition received four sessions of smoking cessation counseling 
located in their primary care clinic. The QL condition consisted of four sessions that were 
conducted via telephone in participants’ homes or by mobile phone. The content of the QL 
condition was designed to mimic tobacco quitline counseling. The content of counseling in 
the ITM and QL conditions was based on the Combined Behavioral Intervention (CBI), 
which integrates Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (“ Brief 
treatments for cannabis dependence: findings from a randomized multisite trial,” 2004 ; 
Miller, 2004 ; Stephens, Babor, Kadden, & Miller, 2002 ). The counseling in both treatment 
arms was adapted to adhere to principles of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Self-
Determination Theory posits that interventions that support participant autonomy facilitate 
the internalization of motivation to change and increase perceived competence to do so and 
thereby make behavior change more likely ( Deci & Ryan, 1985 ). Components of counseling 
consistent with SDT included listening to participant perspectives, providing relevant Liebmann et al. Page 5

information, inviting questions, supporting attempts at behavior change while minimizing 
counselor pressure and control so that patients could make their own choices related to 
quitting ( Williams et al., 2002a ). Quit Tips and pharmacotherapy guidance were provided to 
all patients during the first counseling session. A 5-Day Quit Plan was also completed 
during the first counseling session and updated as desired by the participant.
Physician office involvement.— Patients were recruited from primary-care clinics. 
Providers were informed about the study and agreed to facilitate recruitment by identifying 
and referring smokers as well as providing a room to place the equipment. Although 
participants’ physicians did not have a formal role in the intervention, participants in both 
ITM and QL arms were encouraged to collaborate with their physicians on quitting smoking 
by sharing with them their Quit Plans and requesting advice and scripts for smoking 
cessation medications.
Measures
Healthcare Provider Autonomy Support.— The Healthcare Climate Questionnaire, 
short-form (HCCQ) was used in the present study as a measure of participants’ perception of 
support provided by their healthcare providers and has been used previously within the 
context of smoking cessation ( Williams et al., 2002a ; Williams, Grow, Freedman, Ryan, & 
Deci, 1996 ). The short-form version of the HCCQ has 6 items (e.g., My health care 
providers listen to how I would like to do things regarding my smoking) and is scored on a 1 
(strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) scale. The HCCQ was administered at study 
baseline and the 3-month follow-up. The HCCQ at study baseline ( ωTotal = .90, 95% CI [.
88, .91]) and at 3-months ( ωTotal = .93, 95% CI [.91, .94]) had satisfactory internal 
consistency. The HCCQ will be referred to subsequently by the construct it represents, 
provider autonomy support (PAS).
Working Alliance.— The Working Alliance Inventory, short-form (WAI) was administered 
to measure the therapeutic alliance perceived by participants with their smoking cessation 
counselor. The WAI is a 12-item measure (e.g., My Connect 2 Quit counselor and I agreed 
about the things I need to do help improve my situation) scored on a 7-point Likert-scale 
ranging from 1 ( never ) to 7 ( always ) (Tracey & Kokotovic, 1989 ). The WAI was 
administered at the 3-month follow-up only because it could not be used prior to the 
participants receiving counseling. The WAI had satisfactory internal consistency ( ωTotal = .
85, 95% CI [.78, .90]).
Perceived Competence for Smoking Cessation.— The Perceived Competence Scale 
for Smoking Cessation (PC) was administered to measure the degree to which participants 
felt able to quit smoking. The Perceived Competence scale is a 4-item measure (e.g., I feel 
confident in my ability to quit smoking) scored on a 7-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 
(strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) (Williams, Freedman, & Deci, 1998 ). The internal 
consistencies for PC at study baseline ( ωTotal = .82, 95% CI [.79, .85]) and at 3-months 
(ωTotal = .94, 95% CI [.93, .95]) were satisfactory.Liebmann et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Autonomous Motivation.— The Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) was 
administered to measure the degree to which participants had internalized their motivation to 
quit smoking. The version of the TSRQ used in the present study was adapted specifically 
for smoking cessation ( Ryan & Connell, 1989 ; Williams et al., 2002a ). The measure has 12 
items (e.g., The reason I would quit smoking is because I feel that I want to take 
responsibility for my own health) scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 ( strongly disagree ) 
to 7 ( strongly agree ). The present analysis used only the six items composing the 
Autonomous Motivation (AM) subscale of the TSRQ. The internal consistency of the AM 
subscale was adequate at both study baseline ( ωTotal = .84, 95% CI [.80, .88]) and 3-months 
(ωTotal = .89, 95% CI [.85, .92]).
Smoking cessation.— Two indicators of smoking cessation were used as outcome 
measures. The primary outcome of the trial and the primary focus of our analysis was 
verified quit at 12 months (M12QUIT), assessed using 7-day point prevalence that was 
verified using salivary cotinine, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO), or by proxy. A 15ng/ml cut-
point was used to differentiate smokers and nonsmokers ( SRNT Subcommittee on 
Biochemical Verification, 2002 ). Samples were returned to the University of Kansas Medical 
Center and stored in a freezer. Samples were sent to Dr. Neal Benowtiz at the University of 
California, San Francisco for analysis using a gas chromatography technique ( Jacob, Wilson, 
& Benowitz, 1981 ; Spierto et al., 1988 ). Participants who reported quitting and were taking 
nicotine replacement therapy were asked to provide an exhaled CO sample. Samples ≤ 10 
ppm were considered abstinent ( Hughes et al., 2003 ). A secondary outcome of the trial was 
prolonged abstinence defined as self-reported continuous abstinence following a “grace 
period” of 1 month from beginning of treatment to allow treatment to take effect ( Hughes et 
al., 2003 ). We supplemented our main analysis with an examination of the SDT-based model 
using prolonged abstinence as the outcome.
The self-reported number of days quit in the past 6-months and number of quit attempts 
made in the last 6-months were used in bivariate correlations with the SDT constructs. These 
self-reported smoking cessation outcomes were collected during the 12-month follow-up 
assessment.
Data Analysis
In order to test the conceptual model, structural equation modeling (SEM) using latent 
change scores (LCS) was used to model the inter-relationships among changes in the SDT 
constructs and their associations with smoking cessation. The analysis focused on 12-month 
abstinence, which was biochemically confirmed and the primary outcome of the trial, but we 
also repeated all analyses using prolonged abstinence. The use of LCS is preferable to that 
of observed change scores because measurement error can be modeled separately in the 
latent variable framework, whereas change scores are contaminated by measurement error 
when calculated directly from the observed data ( McArdle & Hamagami, 2003 ). Latent 
change scores are explicitly modeled distinct latent variables and represent the change in a 
latent construct occurring between adjacent time-points ( Selig & Preacher, 2009 ). In this 
analysis, all latent change scores represent change in SDT constructs occurring between the 
assessments at baseline and 3-months. Latent change scores are estimated by constraining Liebmann et al. Page 7

the paths from latent variable (LV) Time 1  to LV Time2  and from ΔLV Time2,1  to LV Time2  to one 
(MacKinnon, 2008 ; McArdle & Hamagami, 2003 ). In order to account for the dependence 
among observations due to repeated measurements, clustered standard errors were estimated 
using the TYPE = COMPLEX function in Mplus, version 7.4 ( Muthén & Muthén, 1998–
2011 ).
Mediation models using LCS were adapted from LCS mediation models discussed in Selig 
and Preacher (2009)  and MacKinnon (2008) . The product-of-coefficients approach was used 
to estimate point estimates of the indirect effects. Assessing the statistical significance of 
indirect effects using p-values is liable to Type II error ( Fritz & MacKinnon, 2007 ; Hayes & 
Scharkow, 2013 ). Confidence intervals for the indirect effects were estimated using Monte 
Carlo simulation (MC) ( Preacher & Selig, 2012 ). For each indirect effect, the constituent 
unstandardized regression coefficients and asymptotic covariance matrix of these estimates 
were used as the parameters of a multivariate normal sampling distribution. A large 
sampling distribution (1 × 107) for each regression coefficient was obtained. The product of 
the sampling distributions for the regression coefficients formed the sampling distribution 
for the indirect effect, of which the 95% confidence interval was derived by obtaining the 
values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.
Six mediation paths were estimated. Indirect effect 1 was a path from study arm (ITM vs. 
QL) to verified quit at 12-months through ΔPAS and ΔAM. Indirect effect 2 was comprised 
by a path from study arm to cessation through WAI and ΔPC. Indirect effect 3 was a path 
from study arm to cessation through ΔPAS and ΔPC. Indirect Effect 4 was comprised by a 
path from study arm to cessation through WAI and ΔAM. Indirect effect 5 was comprised of 
a path from study arm to cessation through WAI, ΔAM and ΔPC. Lastly, indirect effect 6 
was comprised of a path from study arm to cessation through, ΔPAS, ΔAM and ΔPC.
Before specifying the structural model, longitudinal invariance was tested for each measure 
with repeated assessments in order to establish the invariance of SDT-related constructs over 
time ( Little, Preacher, Selig, & Card, 2007 ). Strong invariance (item loadings and intercepts 
constrained to equality across time) was achieved for HCCQ and PC. Weak invariance (item 
loadings constrained to equality) was achieved for PC. In addition, the measurement model 
for the WAI was also specified to ensure adequate fit and construct validity. Satisfactory 
model fit was achieved for a single-factor measurement model for the WAI ( χ2 (52) = 
129.90, RMSEA =.061, 90% CI [.048, .074], TLI =.879).
The structural model was adjusted for nicotine dependence, age, gender, and education. 
Rates of missing data were 17%, 14%, and 12% for months 3, 6, and 12, respectively. 
Missing data were handled using full information maximum likelihood (FIML). Fit statistics 
for the structural model could not be estimated due to the inclusion of the categorical 
outcome (M12QUIT) and the use of clustered standard errors. All confirmatory and 
structural models were estimated using robust maximum likelihood in Mplus, version 7.4 
(Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2011 ). Monte Carlo simulation of the confidence intervals for the 
indirect effects was conducted in R, version 3.3.1 ( R Core Team, 2016 ).Liebmann et al. Page 8

Results
Preliminary Analyses
Sample characteristics by treatment arm are presented in Table 1. No significant differences 
were observed with respect to treatment arm. As reported previously in the main outcomes 
paper ( Richter et al., 2015 ), the rate of self-reported 7-day point prevalent abstinence at 3-
months for the quitline and ITM groups were 19.4% and 23.2% at 3-months, respectively. 
The rates of self-reported 7-day point prevalent abstinence for the quitline and ITM groups 
at 6-months were 20.4% and 20.3%, respectively. The rates of biochemically verified 
abstinence at 12-months for the quitline and ITM groups were 12% and 9.8%, respectively. 
The rates of prolonged abstinence for the quitline and ITM groups was 8.1% and 7.6%, 
respectively. There were no significant group differences at any of the time points.
The SDT-related constructs were moderately correlated concurrently and prospectively 
(Table 2). Self-Determination Theory constructs at baseline and 3-months were weakly-to-
moderately associated with smoking outcomes at 12-months. The number of days quit in the 
last 6-months, reported at 12-months, was positively associated with autonomous motivation 
at baseline ( r = .12, p = .01) and 3-months ( r = .19, p < .01), perceived competence for 
quitting at 3-months ( r = .31, p < .01), and healthcare provider support at 3-months ( r = .14, 
p = .01). The number of quit attempts in the past 6-months at the end of study follow-up was 
positively associated with perceived competence at baseline ( r = .12, p = .01).
Structural Equation Model and Mediation Analysis
Because results of the model using 7-day point prevalence verified cessation as the outcome 
were very similar to the model for prolonged abstinence we present the findings for the 
primary outcome only. The results of the structural equation model are depicted in Figure 2. 
Relative to the Quitline condition (QL), Integrated Telemedicine (ITM) was associated with 
significantly greater gains in perceived healthcare provider autonomy support (ΔPAS) during 
the 3-month intervention period ( b = .347, p < .001). Contrary to our hypothesis, being in the 
telemedicine arm did not lead to greater perceived working alliance (WAI) at 3-months. 
Intervention condition did not have significant associations with change in autonomous 
motivation (ΔAM) or perceived competence to quit (ΔPC) or verified smoking cessation at 
12-months.
The structural model showed different patterns of association between WAI and ΔPAS and 
the latent changes scores for AM and PC. Increases in healthcare provider support were 
positively associated with increases in ΔPC ( b = .136, p < .001) and were significantly 
associated with change in ΔAM ( b = .052, p < .01.). Working alliance at 3-months was not 
associated with increases in ΔPC ( b = .360 p = n.s.), but was positively associated with ΔAM 
(b = .562, p < .01).
The latent change score for PC was the only SDT construct that predicted biochemically 
verified smoking cessation at 12-months ( OR = 1.474, p < .01). Nicotine dependence, as 
measured by the FTND, was associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation ( OR 
= .838, p = .001).Liebmann et al. Page 9

Estimated indirect effects with their respective 95% confidence intervals are presented in 
Table 3. The path from arm to ΔPAS to ΔPC to M12Quit was statistically significant 
(indirect effect = .0183, 95% CI [.003, .044]). This indirect effect can be expressed and 
interpreted as an odds ratio ( Huang, Sivaganesan, Succop, & Goodman, 2004 ; Preacher, 
2015 ). The indirect effect coefficients in this analysis represent the product of the regression 
coefficient for each individual path comprising the indirect effect. In other words, they 
represent a composite effect of treatment arm and first and second-order mediators. Thus, 
the joint of effect of ITM and intra-individual increases in perceived autonomy support and 
perceived competence to quit smoking, is associated with a 1.8% increase in odds of 
smoking cessation compared to telephone counseling. The indirect effect from arm to ΔPAS 
to ΔAM to ΔPC to M12 Quit was also significant (indirect effect = .003, 95% CI [.002, .
015]). For this path, the joint effect of ITM and intra-individual changes in provider 
autonomy support, autonomous motivation and perceived competence is associated with a 
0.3% increase in odds of cessation.
Discussion
Whereas the primary outcome analysis ( Richter et al., 2015 ) showed no difference between 
treatments in their effects on cessation, the present analysis provides deeper insight into 
effective pathways and mechanisms of action. We found that integrated telemedicine 
predicted perceived autonomy support from health care providers at 3-months after 
randomization, which in turn was directly associated with perceived competence to quit at 3-
months after randomization, which predicted smoking cessation after treatment. 
Additionally, a second indirect effect was observed that extended the first by incorporating 
change in autonomous motivation. These pathways were consistent with the SDT 
intervention model, and provide evidence that integrated telemedicine outperforms phone 
counseling in facilitating greater perceived provider support for cessation. These results are 
supported by our previously published finding that ITM participants were more likely to 
recommend the intervention to other smokers than phone counseling participants ( Richter et 
al., 2015 ).
The effective pathways identified through SEM did not involve all of the mechanisms we 
originally hypothesized would contribute to the primary outcome—this perhaps accounts for 
the observation of no overall group differences in outcome. First, the effects of the 
interventions on targeted mediators were mixed. Integrated telemedicine positively 
influenced change in perceived provider autonomy support, but surprisingly, the visual cues 
in ITM did not appear to lead to enhanced working alliance relative to phone. We used the 
HCCQ to assess support from participants’ health care providers, and the WAI to evaluate 
participants’ interactions with their smoking cessation counselors. We may have not detected 
a difference in alliance because participants in ITM attended fewer sessions than those 
receiving phone counseling, such that any advantages to communicating via telemedicine 
were overwhelmed by the superior dose of phone contact. This dose imbalance would not 
affect perceived health care provider support, because only ITM participants had sessions at 
their providers’ offices. Alternatively, telemedicine for smoking cessation may simply have 
no alliance related advantages over phone counseling. Telemedicine appears to perform as 
well as face-to-face treatment for a number of conditions, and a number of trials have Liebmann et al. Page 10

demonstrated that telephone performs as well as face-to-face counseling at delivering 
interventions for a number of health interventions, including genetic counseling and obesity 
treatment ( Appel et al., 2011 ; Harrigan et al., 2016 ; Schwartz et al., 2014 ). The logical 
extension is that telephone may perform as well as telemedicine counseling.
Second, targeted mediators were positively correlated with second order SDT mediators and 
influenced them as expected. In two prior studies of SDT interventions on smoking 
cessation, changes in HCCQ enhanced autonomous motivation, which in turn increased rates 
of cessation ( Williams et al., 2002b ; Williams et al., 2006 ). In the present analysis, a similar 
effect was observed. Provider autonomy support was associated with greater change in 
autonomous motivation, which in turn was associated with increased PC and greater odds of 
cessation. Perceived autonomy support may have been bolstered by the proximity of 
providers during counseling sessions, and by additional information and treatment assistance 
they may have provided before, during, and/or after each session. Thus, this indirect effect is 
consistent with that observed in previous SDT-informed interventions for smoking cessation 
(Williams et al., 2006 ).
Third, second order mediators had mixed effects on the outcome. Consistent with Williams 
and colleagues (2006) , the ITM intervention significantly increased perceived autonomy 
support, which was associated with greater changes in perceived competence for quitting 
smoking, which in turn was significantly associated with smoking cessation. Receiving 
counseling via telemedicine in the medical home enhanced perceived competence in a way 
that home-based phone counseling did not. Perhaps the perception that the health care team 
was prepared to expend office space, provider time, and technology on smoking cessation—
in addition to the enhanced feelings of support from the providers—provided evidence that 
providers believed in the participants’ ability to quit, which in turn helped participants 
believe in their own ability to quit. The association between perceived competence and 
quitting smoking accords with current literature. Perceived competence and self-efficacy, 
which are distinct but similar concepts related to the ability to perform behaviors, are among 
the most reliable psychological predictors of health behavior change ( Ng et al., 2012 ; 
Strecher, DeVellis, Becker, & Rosenstock, 1986 ).
This suggests that cessation counseling at a distance—that is in some way integrated into the 
medical office milieu—enhances efforts to quit smoking by boosting autonomy support 
directly and perceived competence indirectly. Integrating distance counseling in busy and 
often crowded clinical practices might be a challenge, but merits consideration. The parent 
study found that costs for delivering ITM versus phone counseling were equivalent, except 
for the cost of the clinic space for the ITM session ( Richter et al., 2015 ). One solution might 
be to hold ITM sessions after clinic business hours, which would extend the utility of the 
office without taking examining room time away from the treatment of other conditions. 
Reimbursement for telemedicine-delivered care, which is available in some states, obviates 
this issue and facilitates individuals to choose their preferred approach to smoking cessation 
interventions.1

The findings provide support for the SDT model that was examined and replicates findings 
from 2 prior SDT based smoking cessation trials as well as a study of SDT in diabetes self-
management ( Williams et al., 2006 ; Williams, McGregor, Zeldman, Freedman, & Deci, 
2004 ; Williams, Niemiec, Patrick, Ryan, & Deci, 2009 ; Williams et al., 2016 ). The present 
study extends the findings from those trials which used face to face and phone counseling by 
showing that ITM is also effective at fostering cessation through autonomy support, 
autonomous motivation, and perceived competence. Our results also indicated that the 
indirect effects of the intervention were ultimately mediated through perceived competence 
rather than autonomous motivation. This is consistent with both prior SDT based smoking 
cessation studies as well as a study of SDT in diabetes self-management ( Williams et al., 
2004 ).
Taken as a whole, results indicate that SDT is a useful model for understanding health 
behavior change and for identifying key behavioral mechanisms for facilitating behavior 
change. The two statistically significant indirect effects observed in this analysis were 
entirely consistent with SDT. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the indirect effect of 
telemedicine on cessation was small and we found relatively small effects between the first 
and second order mediators. In particular, the effect of autonomy support on autonomous 
motivation and competence was near zero (b = .05). Thus, the intervention was able to 
increase provider autonomy support, however the downstream effect of enhancing autonomy 
support on second order mediators was limited in this trial. This is consistent with the lack 
of an overall difference in cessation between ITM and phone that was observed in the 
primary outcome analysis ( Richter et al., 2015 ). This result may also be related to the fact 
that we did not assess autonomous motivation for medication adherence. Williams et al. 
(2006)  used a combined measure of autonomous motivation that included autonomous 
motivation for medication use and autonomous motivation for cessation. They found a 
significant path between autonomous motivation and cessation via medication use. Thus our 
findings may underestimate the effect of autonomous motivation on cessation. Moreover, 
Williams et al. (2006)  operationalized abstinence by means of a latent variable that 
incorporated 7-day point prevalence abstinence, longest number of days not smoking, and 
number of days since last cigarette. Both these measurement differences may have 
contributed to the lack of a direct association between autonomous motivation and cessation 
found in the present study.
The study had a number of strengths and limitations. This study is an excellent test of the 
interventions and the effects of SDT, because we specified our conceptual model a priori , 
carefully measured each observed variable and putative SDT mechanism, and collected 
repeated measures longitudinally to assess the effects of the intervention on SDT 
mechanisms across time. Because SDT has been widely used for health behavior change, 
including smoking cessation, we were able to employ validated measures of theoretical 
components. One limitation is that we opted to measure autonomy support via only the 
Health Care Climate Questionnaire, and we asked participants to report solely on the support 
provided by health care providers. In addition, we did not posit a priori  hypotheses regarding 
how treatment might engage controlled motivation in service of behavior change because the 
intervention implemented in this study was designed to be autonomy supportive. Although 
previous SDT research has also not observed an association between controlled motivation Liebmann et al. Page 12

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
and smoking cessation ( Williams et al., 2006 ), it may be useful for future SDT-informed 
research to include controlled motivation to confirm these findings and to provide a more 
complete picture of the interrelationships between SDT constructs.
With regard to the Working Alliance Questionnaire, we asked participants to report solely on 
the alliance they felt with their smoking cessation counselors. We could have asked for 
participants to report on the autonomy support and therapeutic alliance they experienced 
from both their health care providers and their smoking cessation counselors, but this would 
have created additional respondent burden and potentially confused patients through excess 
repetition of the same measures. There may also be other constructs and pathways that are 
not based on SDT or working alliance that influenced the outcomes of the trial. Study 
findings are not generalizable outside of the treatment of rural smokers. Last, although our 
mediators were measured longitudinally, it is important to not assume causal associations 
between these factors. This is particularly the case with regard to change in autonomous 
motivation and change in perceived competence, as these constructs were measured 
concurrently.
In spite of these limitations, the present findings suggest the study interventions generally 
influenced SDT constructs as expected. However, the indirect effect of telemedicine on 
cessation through SDT constructs was small and not sufficient to yield clinically meaningful 
differences in cessation. This is consistent with the null findings of the primary outcome 
analysis and highlights how mediation analysis can be used to gain better insight into the 
mechanisms of change underlying the results of intervention trials.
