ABSTRACT
Background: School-based interventions that increase physical
activity (PA) in a sustainable way are lacking. Systematic and
participatory, theory and evidence-based intervention
development may enhance the e ﬀectiveness of complex
behavioural interventions in the long term. However, detailed
descriptions of the intervention development process are rarely
openly published, hindering transparency and progress in the ﬁeld.
Aims: To illustrate a stepwise process to develop intervention
targeting PA and sedentary behaviour (SB) among olderadolescents, and to describe the ﬁnal, optimised version of the
intervention, detailing content of sessions by theoreticaldeterminants and techniques.Methods: Two established intervention development frameworks
(Intervention Mapping and Behaviour Change Wheel) wereintegrated, leading to a comprehensive evidence and theory-
based process. It was informed by empirical studies, literature
reviews, expert and stakeholder consultation, including scenarioevaluation and component pre-testing. In all steps, contextual ﬁt
and potential for sustainability were ensured by stakeholderengagement.
Results: As a large majority of youth opposed decreasing screen
time, increasing PA and decreasing SB were de ﬁned as target
behaviours, with peers and the school context includingclassroom practices as key social environments in inﬂ uencing
youth PA (problem speci ﬁcation, step 1). Behavioural diagnosis
(step 2) identiﬁ ed a variety of determinants in the domains of
capability (e.g. self-regulation skills), motivation (e.g. outcome
expectations) and environmental opportunities. These were
organised into an intervention theory integrating several formal
theories, including Self-Determination Theory. Theory-alignedprinciples guided material design (Step 3). Feasibility RCT allowed
optimisation into a ﬁnal intervention protocol (step 4).
Conclusions: Intervention elements target students directly, and
indirectly by changing teacher behaviour and the school andARTICLE HISTORY

wider environment. A systematic development and optimisation led
to a high potential for sustainability. The detailed intervention
content, with speci ﬁcation of the hypothesised mechanisms,
allows for other researchers to replicate, adapt or re ﬁne parts or
the whole intervention, considering speci ﬁc target groups and
(sub-)cultures.
Background
Despite the beneﬁ ts of physical activity (PA), adolescents worldwide engage in far less PA
than is recommended (Hallal et al., 2012 ), with the trend being stronger among those with
lower socioeconomic status (SES) (Van Der Horst, Paw, Twisk, & Van Mechelen, 2007 ).
The Finnish National Recommendation for youth physical activity includes light PA
(LPA) and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), and as one key form of sedentary behaviour(SB), screen time limited to maximum of 2 h daily. Re ﬂecting the SES di ﬀerence, the
prevalence of meeting PA recommendations is about 50% lower and prevalence of over-weight almost 50% higher in Finnish vocational schools than in high schools (NationalInstitute of Health and Welfare (THL), 2011 ), and it tends to decline during adolescence
(Van Der Horst et al., 2007 ).
Schools are optimal settings for youth PA promotion (van Sluijs, McMinn, & Griﬃ n,
2007 ): they reach a majority of potential participants, who also spend most of their
time in school context. However, school-based interventions have mainly shown short-
term eﬀ ects on MVPA (Dobbins, DeCorby, Robeson, Husson, & Tirilis, 2009 ), variance
in eﬀ ect sizes has been high (Crutzen, 2010 ) and gender di ﬀerences in e ﬀectiveness
have favoured girls (Yildirim et al., 2011 ). Generally, more intensive and longer interven-
tions have been more e ﬀective (Oldenburg, Absetz, & Chan, 2010 ). Furthermore, school-
based PA interventions have mainly focused on children, and interventions among older
adolescents or in vocational schools are rare (van Sluijs et al., 2007 ).
When the present study was started, only 10 RCTs of school-based interventions to
improve PA or SBs among 15 –19-year-olds had been reported (Hynynen et al., 2016 ). Fur-
thermore, few of the studies had measured behaviour change over a longer follow-up, andthe few that had, showed no e ﬀects. None explained in detail the intervention development
process, even though half of them mentioned a behavioural theory as a basis of the inter-vention, half brie ﬂy described some stages of what could be interpreted as a development
process, but only one study named a speci ﬁc intervention development framework that
they used. Thus, there is a demand to carefully develop and report studies in this area.
PA interventions should be simple, e ﬀective, generalisable, realistic and situation speci ﬁc.
School-based programmes should be suitable for the school environment and designed to be
implemented by teachers (Lubans & Sylva, 2009 ; Reilly & McDowell, 2003 ) and hence
include both teacher- and student-level intervention strategies. For sustainability and scal-
ability, they should be low cost, embeddable into the existing school structures, with good ﬁt
with the context and the daily practices and the values of the target group.
The UK Medical Research Council Guidance for complex interventions (Campbell
et al., 2000 ; Craig et al., 2008 ) recommends using a phased approach in designing
complex multi-level interventions, but utilisation of intervention developmentHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 441
frameworks in practice is rarely described in the literature. We aimed to develop a whole-
school system intervention to promote PA and to reduce SB among Finnish vocational
school students with interventions at teacher and student level. This paper describes indetail the development of the student-level intervention, guided by insights from theUK MRC Guidance and established frameworks for intervention design. Development
of the teacher intervention is only brie ﬂy referred to as a more detailed description of it
can be found elsewhere (Köykkä, Araújo-Soares, Sniehotta, Knittle, & Hankonen, 2019 ).
We report the stepwise development process, including four steps from problem analy-
sis (Step 1) to de ﬁnition of the scienti ﬁc core (Step 2), the design of the intervention
materials (Step 3) and empirical optimisation of the programme (Step 4) (Araújo-
Soares, Hankonen, Presseau, Rodrigues, & Sniehotta, 2018 ). The full ﬁnal intervention
content is also presented.
Methods
Context
Educational level is the most usual marker of socioeconomic position (SEP) in Finland
(Lahelma, Martikainen, Laaksonen, & Aittomäki, 2004 ). A publicly funded compulsory
comprehensive school is provided to all children until age 15 (Grade 9), after which
they apply to an average three-year secondary education either in high schools (academic
track) or vocational schools (occupational training). High schools and vocational schools
are typically situated in completely separate school buildings and are organisationallyindependent from each other. This educational divide is a major predictor of socioeco-nomic health inequalities in adulthood (Lahelma et al., 2004 ), which are among the
highest in the OECD countries (Kunst et al., 2005 ). Lower educated populations have
sometimes been found to respond to health promotion less favourably than the highereducated (e.g. Verloigne et al., 2011 ).
For a whole-school intervention targeting those with lower SEP, vocational schools are
theﬁrst possible point. They are organisationally independent from high schools, and
typically in di ﬀerent locations. Curriculum consists of both hands-on teaching in work-
shop-type classrooms and traditional, more sedentary classroom instruction (e.g. languageclasses). A small amount of health education and physical education (PE) is compulsory(usually one 40-hour course over 2 –4 months).
Procedures
The intervention development process was in line with the UK Medical Research Council
Guidance recommendations (Campbell et al., 2000 ; Craig et al., 2008 ), using a phased
approach to design and feasibility/pilot testing. For more speci ﬁc guidance, we used the
Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) and the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach as inte-grated into four steps (for an analysis and integrative overview of frameworks, see
Araújo-Soares et al., 2018 ), applying multiple theories and mixed methods. Four steps
were followed in the development: In step 1 the problem was analysed and intervention
objectives were developed; step 2 allowed for the de ﬁnition of the behavioural scienti ﬁc
core of the intervention; step 3 led to the design/development of the intervention materials442 N. HANKONEN ET AL.
andﬁnally; step 4 consisted of an empirical optimisation using a randomised feasibility
study. Table 1 shows these frameworks mapped on to each other, according to the key
tasks of intervention development (Hankonen & Hardeman, 2020 ).
With regard to behavioural theories, the COM-B model was used as a general model of
behaviour, including the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) (Cane, O ’Connor, &
Michie, 2012 ; Michie et al., 2005 ), that allows a comprehensive diagnosis of behavioural
inﬂuences without commitment to particular theories. However, more speci ﬁc theories
(e.g. Self-Determination Theory (SDT), Reasoned Action Approach (RAA); Habit
Theory (HT), Control Theory (CT)) were drawn on to inform speci ﬁc aspects of the inter-
vention, as well as empirical studies conducted in preparation for intervention develop-ment. In making decisions (e.g. links to intervention objectives, determinants, behaviourchange techniques i.e. BCTs), the key criteria were Acceptability, Practicability, E ﬀective-
ness, A ﬀordability, Side-e ﬀects, Equity (Michie, Atkins, & West, 2014 ) and Changeability
(Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, Gottlieb, & Fernández, 2011 ) (APEASE-C). More information
on the logic/theoretical model will be presented below (Results, Steps 1 and 2).
In addition to the core intervention development team, the process involved a stake-
holder and steering group, including key stakeholders and experts: researchers, teachers,Table 1. Stages and steps of IM and BCW frameworks mapped onto key intervention development
tasks (adapted from Hankonen & Hardeman, 2020 ).

Step 1 Methods: Analysing the problem
In order to analyse the problem comprehensively, we undertook several sub-studies and
activities. The COM-B model was used as a general theoretical framework, and more
speciﬁ c theories (see above) were used for the assessment and identiﬁ cation of behavioural
determinants. A belief elicitation study (unpublished) that formed a basis for a survey ondeterminants of PA and SB among students (SOLE/Alias Survey: N= 765) was conducted
(Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen, et al., 2017 ; Nurmi, Hagger, Haukkala, Araújo-Soares, &
Hankonen, 2016 ). A seven-day objective PA measurement was carried out within a
sub-sample ( n= 69) in order to validate survey self-report measures and conﬁ rm the feasi-
bility of accelerometry in the target group. Low-active students were de ﬁned as those who
self-reported engaging in more than 20 min of PA on less than three days a week. A
writing contest for older adolescents aimed to acquire narratives about their own percep-
tions of critical incidents leading to PA changes over the course of their life, as well asmaterial for the intervention. Also, we conducted qualitative interviews, to better under-
stand how adolescents perceive the role of activity behaviours in their daily lives and key
inﬂuences, and reviews and systematic reviews of literature on interventions and
approaches to e ﬀectively intervene on youth PA and SB. Data from all these sources
were triangulated and led to evidence-based constraints that shaped intervention develop-
ment choices. In the beginning, informal interviews with vocational school directors and
teachers helped us gain insight into the needs and resources of schools and sta ﬀ, as well as
insight into the speciﬁ cs of the context.
Step 2 Methods: De ﬁning the behavioural scienti ﬁc core of the intervention
The BCW (Michie et al., 2014 ) and IM (Bartholomew et al., 2011 ) were used to shape
the work by the core intervention development team. A wider stakeholder team of experts
and other stakeholders was formed using IM guidance (2011), and included experts in the
domain of PA and SB (UKK Institute, LIKES Research Centre, National institute forHealth and Welfare THL), PE teachers (both from collaborating vocational schools and
teacher association), teacher education experts (Jyväskylä University, Continuing Pro-
fessional Development Unit for PE teachers), health promoting NGOs (working withinvocational schools), students (national student organisation of vocational school students)and the research team.444 N. HANKONEN ET AL.
Based on evidence gathered in Step 1, we assessed the needs and strengths of the
target group and school setting; de ﬁned intervention objectives; and selected relevant
determinants (mediators of intervention e ﬀect) and BCTs to change the determinants.
Alternative intervention scenarios and individual smaller elements (e.g. standing desks
in classrooms, possibility to lend PA equipment at school, reviewing PA goals in small
groups, contacts between schools and local PA actors) were subject to evaluation and
further development.
Step 3 Methods: Designing and developing intervention materials
Based on the theoretical model of the intervention and the speci ﬁc BCTs identi ﬁed in
step 2, an advertising agency was commissioned to design all intervention materials.
Reﬁnements to the proposed designs were made based on behavioural science evidence
(e.g. eliminate messages reinforcing appearance-based motives to be physically active, inlight of the possible adverse e ﬀects on well-being and high-quality motivation). In this
process, and to assure higher levels of acceptability and feasibility of materials, student
engagement was intensi ﬁed.
Step 4 Methods: Empirical optimisation
A randomised feasibility study was conducted (ISRCTN34534846) to pre-test interven-
tion activities and research procedures in one vocational school unit, with 16 teachers and
42 student participants (Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen, et al., 2017 ). Optimisation of
research procedures has been reported in a separate paper (Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen,
et al., 2017 ). Optimisation of the intervention procedures was based on ﬁeld notes by
the researcher implementing the intervention, feedback received from study participants
on sessions and materials as well as interviews with low-active students ( n= 15). For
the most pressing issues and potential pitfalls for intervention optimisation, the expert
group (see Step 3) brainstormed potential solutions and necessary requirements. The
core intervention development team then utilised this feedback to ﬁnalise intervention
content and form.
The above-described development work was conducted in practice over several
months, and included many activities.
Ethics statement
Participants of empirical studies were treated according to principles of the HelsinkiDeclaration, and were informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any
point. An Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa reviewed
the study protocols and provided favourable views.
Results
Intervention development was an iterative process as usual (Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok,Gottlieb, & Fernandez, 2011 ; Michie, van Stralen, & West, 2011 ) with empirical data
obtained at di ﬀerent steps from di ﬀerent sources, feeding back and shaping intervention
decisions, and often determining going back a step in order to reach a ﬁnal draft interven-
tion. Figure 1 shows the main steps of the development process (For an in-depth introduc-
tion to the integrated steps, see Araújo-Soares et al., 2018 ).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 445
Step 1: Analysing the problem
To analyse the problem and understand the target behaviour and context, ﬁndings from
qualitative and quantitative studies and systematic review were synthesised to identify and
specify the intervention objectives and determinants of behaviour and behaviour change.
We also assessed needs and community capacity. Supplementary Table S1 collates all studies.
Selecting and specifying the target behaviour
Qualitative interviews shed light on how girls and boys in vocational schools engaged and
perceived PA and existing opportunities for PA (Liimakka, Jallinoja, & Hankonen, 2013)
and their perceptions of in ﬂuences on changes in PA over the life course (Liimakka, Jallinoja,
&H a n k o n e n , in press ). It also revealed that some students may equate PA with PE classes
(in schools) and with MVPA, pointing to the need to address this misconception and clearlydeﬁne these behaviours for (and with) students. There was wide variation in how students
experienced PA. A belief elicitation study identi ﬁed most salient beliefs ( Table 2 ).
The SOLE/Alias survey investigated PA and predictors of PA (see also Step 2). Results
on PA levels were in line with the national school health survey. Regarding motivation toincrease PA, altogether 42.7% of the students indicated that they are happy with theircurrent level of PA with no willingness to increase it. Among low-active students, there
Figure 1. Intervention development process overview.446 N. HANKONEN ET AL.
was a signi ﬁcant gender di ﬀerence with 75.4% of girls willing to do more PA compared to
only 44.6% of the boys (CI95 of population di ﬀerence: [19.7, 41.9] %-points).
The majority (58.7%) was satisﬁ ed with the levels of their screen time. Even among
those with over 4 h of screen time per day during weekdays, 55.2% stated being happy
with the current levels. However, some acknowledged that screen time would reduce
their opportunities for PA and spending time outdoors. Only few (12.2%) gave acorrect answer regarding the national PA recommendation. Over one-third (35.8%)
reported the screen time recommendation correctly at 2 h, and a similar proportion
underestimated it (1 h/day). Awareness of the recommendations was not associatedwith motivation to change behaviour (Hankonen, Heino, Kujala, et al., 2017 ).
As most of the target group reported no willingness to change their exposure to screen
time, the changeability of this target behaviour was estimated to be low. Hence, instead ofthe Finnish National Recommendation of reducing screen time, we selected two otherbehavioural objectives for SB: reducing SB in school and elsewhere.
Specifying determinants for change
The qualitative interviews (Liimakka et al., in press ,2013 ) pointed at social networks as a
key in ﬂuence on PA and sports (see Table 2 ). Behavioural determinants of PA and SB
identi ﬁed from the SOLE/Alias survey informed the selection of mediators of behaviourTable 2. Keyﬁndings from preliminary research phase. See supplementary Table S1 for the original
studies.
Step 1:
1. Gender di ﬀerences in motivation to increase PA were observed, with girls being more motivated than boys.
2. Willingness to increase PA was promising –especially among low-active girls. However, gender di ﬀerences between
the ‘acceptability ’of this intervention objectives point to a need to include in the intervention both motivational and
post-intentional behaviour change strategies.
3. Key salient beliefs regarding outcomes of PA included advantages such as better physical condition, better mood and
weight management, and also disadvantages such as tiredness, lack of energy, less time for other things.
4. Injury prevention was identi ﬁed as one key component to be included in PA promotion interventions, and in this age
group, the recommended way to incorporate injury prevention was to improve motor-coordination abilities [e.g. 28].
5. PA takes varied forms for each individual, hence it will not be feasible to specify common MVPA objectives for all
participants (e.g. commuting or leisure PA, types of PA). Based on theory, evidence and pre-testing, we identi ﬁed a
need for personal agency in planning SMART goals in a personalised way so that they would be attainable and
relevant for participants. Hence, for PA individual goal setting needs to be facilitated. SB, however, needs to beaddressed within the classroom setting given students ’‘red lines ’i.e. low acceptability of leisure screen-time
reduction.
6. Teachers perceived sitting reduction as a useful and acceptable way of organising the lesson, and often even
necessary, because students were seen as unable to concentrate if required to sit still the whole time [28].
7. Any intervention in the school setting needs to have high ﬁt with the curriculum and not take up too many lessons
(see Supplementary Material for more detailed information on ﬁtting the programme in the national curriculum).
Step 2:
8. Behavioural diagnosis rendered all COM-B domains relevant except for the physical capability.9. Previous similar interventions are heavily focused on volitional strategies, i.e. goal setting and action planning [9],
which might imply that techniques to increase motivation are too scarce. Autonomous PA motivation is related to theuse of self-regulatory strategies, which, in turn, predict PA [22]. Hence, as evidence showed that levels of motivationof this age group students to increase their PA are quite low but that prior interventions had little focus onmotivation, we concluded that in this context and target group, motivation may have been under-targeted relative to
target group ’s needs.
10. Previous interventions have shown an e ﬀect on girls but not on boys. Our original study showed that girls were at
the outset more motivated to change their PA than boys. Lack of components targeting motivational aspects and
focus on post-intentional self-regulation strategies in previous research may account for the ﬁnding that boys are
less likely to change in many of the school-based interventions [e.g. 4].HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 447

change (see Table 3 and supplements: Figure S2, Figure S3, Table S6, Table S7). To gain
more in-depth understanding of the target group, we compared the vocational and high-
school students. The results revealed small di ﬀerences in 13 out of 17 determinants
assessed (Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen, et al., 2017 ).
Ensuring ﬁt of the selected strategies with the implementation context and potential
for sustainabilityIn the early phases of the project, students in vocational schools were required to under-
take 27 h of PE and 27 h of Health education (HE) during their three-year curriculum.
These were previously organised as two separate courses, but due to curriculumchanges by the later government this course provision was cut by over 50% of study
hours (over three years only 27 h of both PE and HE). These topics are taught by
qualiﬁed PE teachers, although currently a large part of the teachers are not formally
qualiﬁed.
A sta ﬀsurvey (N= 301) informed us about PE classes, the availability of extracurricular
activities and accessibility of PA facilities. We collected teachers ’views of candidate inter-
vention strategies for sitting reduction (in classrooms i.e. speci ﬁc behavioural objectives
for teachers) with this survey and focus group interviews (Laine, Araújo-Soares, Haukkala,
& Hankonen, 2017 ). (For the use of these ﬁndings in the development of the teacher inter-
vention, see (Köykkä et al., 2019 )).
Step 2: Deﬁ ning behavioural scienti ﬁc core
Understand causal and contextual factors
We aimed to understand and identify contextual in ﬂuences on PA and SB. Using the ﬁrst
version of the BCW guide (Michie et al., 2014 ), the core intervention development team
ﬁrst discussed and investigated the drivers of in ﬂuences on behaviour. (See Supplementary
Figure S1 for the social network map of in ﬂuences on students PA and SB.) The behavioural
diagnosis rendered all COM-B domains potentially important targets. The only subdomain
that already had su ﬃcient levels was deemed to be physiological capability , as all youth can
be expected to have su ﬃcient capabilities for non-professional, leisure-time PA. For moreTable 3. Continued.

McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ; Ng et al., 2012 ). For simplicity, constructs from these theories are
presented under the TDF (Cane et al., 2012 ; Michie et al., 2005 ).
Develop a logic/theoretical modelTable 3 presents an overview of the main theoretical determinants of PA behaviour, along
with examples of intervention content targeting them and the corresponding TDF
domains. The hypothesised mechanisms for student PA change have been listed in OSF
(https://osf.io/h2uaq/ ).
Considering the identi ﬁed determinants of behaviour, the theoretical model of the
intervention was ﬁrst and foremost based on the SDT (Deci & Ryan, 2000 ), with con-
structs from other approaches such as RAA (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2011 ) and self-regulation
and planning approaches were also used, but SDT corollaries were used as a form ofmaking decisions on the determinants to target. For example, the RAA posits injunctive
norms as important predictors of behaviour and thus intervention targets. SDT principles
conﬂict with this hypothesis by positing that external pressure would contribute to con-
trolled forms of motivation which, as opposed to autonomous motivation, would not
lead to sustainable changes in behaviour. Therefore RAA injunctive norms were not
included into the theoretical model while RAA descriptive norms were included.
Deﬁne Intervention Features
After being presented insights and evidence (e.g. student interviews), the expert group
generated ideas of practical intervention strategies and techniques, followed by more
speciﬁ c analyses of strengths, weaknesses and preconditions for feasibility. Based on
these (as well as evidence from the reviews and survey), the core intervention team elabo-
rated on these and selected some of the generated ideas as potential intervention com-
ponents, and created alternative intervention scenarios. In the next expert group
meeting, experts assessed these intervention scenarios with regard to their potentialeﬃcacy and feasibility in the school setting. Divided in small groups, they discussed and
listed each of the intervention scenario ’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats, and gave further re ﬁnement suggestions. APEASE-C criteria were also considered.
These were then further developed by the core team.
The intervention functions and policy categories (BCW) were partially pre-de ﬁned as
the project was to a school-based intervention: hence, guidelines, legislation, ﬁnances, etc.
were out of question. However, to plan for wider impact and dissemination, the NationalBoard of Education was contacted early on to initiate discussions about the future possi-
bility to integrate the Let ’s Move It programme into the Finnish school curriculum, and to
ensure ﬁt with the current PE and health education curriculum.
In the design process, evidence-based elements of e ﬀective school-based health promotion
programmes identi ﬁed in reviews (Dadaczynski & de Vries, 2013; Peters, Kok, Ten Dam,
Buijs, & Paulussen, 2009)w e r ea l s oi n c o r p o r a t e d( i fi nl i n ew i t ht h ec o r es c i e n t i ﬁc model of
this intervention as well as with its logic model a nd if feasible). Although these reviews targeted
diﬀerent age groups, upon detailed analysis, th e
 conclusions seemed to be generalisable to450 N. HANKONEN ET AL.
older adolescents (see also Supplementary Table S2). These elements included the use of
theory; addressing social in ﬂuences; addressing motivations and cognitive-behavioural skills;
training of and on-going support to facilitators; using multiple components targeting
behaviour (e.g. combining education wi th environmental change); programme ﬁtw i t h
school routines; engagement of target group; a nd collaboration with c ommunity partners.
As using classroom-based education alone (Dobbins et al., 2009) and targeting multiple
health behaviours (Crutzen, 2010)h a v eb e e ns h o w nt ob ei n e ﬀective in promoting PA, we
chose a multi-level approach targeting PA an d sedentary behaviours in the school setting
and also supporting students in changing t heir behaviours in other life contexts.
Our systematic review of previous similar RCTs coded the interventions for the BCTs
and other elements to identify what characterises e ﬀective interventions (Hynynen et al.,
2016 ). In line with PA interventions among adults, BCTs such as self-monitoring and
goal-techniques, including graded tasks, were supported.
We considered a variety of intervention features but had to leave many candidate
strategies out. For example, for student intervention, we considered mental rehearsal
(of instigating PA session and overcoming barriers, and of positive consequences);individualised PA report feedback and guidance ;elements targeting behaviour change
maintenance , e.g. habit formation for PA and SB. However, due to too short slots, expenses
and scalability concerns, the intervention core team decided to leave these out.
In selecting intervention features, the changeability of various key determinants was
considered, relative to the resources available and practicability (along with other
APEASE-C criteria). For example, friends were evaluated to be important ( ‘eﬀectiveness ’),
however di ﬃcult to directly target and change ( ‘practicability ’,‘changeability ’) in a school-
based intervention (as for many vocational school students, they have an already estab-lished friends group elsewhere and do not mainly hang out with classmates). Therefore,
we decided to teach ways in which the youth may get their friends involved in PA, butnot target friends directly as it would be costly.
Practicability issues relative to evaluation design also a ﬀected some choices. For
example, whole-school strategies such as a kick-o ﬀevent for entire school along with inter-
vention-relevant roles and tasks for entire sta ﬀ(including janitors and cleaners) were con-
sidered, but arranging considerable school-wide support –especially when not all students
would be included in the longitudinal RCT design –was deemed too costly and imprac-
ticable to carry out properly given the cRCT design with multiple schools.
As mentioned above, components of the intervention were pretested among student
panel and teachers/classrooms with students. A panel consisting of low-active studentswas consulted to pre-test and generate ideas for re ﬁnement of potential practical sub-
components of the intervention in several face-to-face sessions.
Step 3. Design and development of intervention materials and production
Programme planning included testing of all programme components and materials with
user involvement. The key principles also in designing the materials relied on a participa-
tory approach. Results from the belief elicitation study and the subsequent survey were
used to develop the intervention (e.g. messages for the sessions, poster campaign).
Material design was conducted in collaboration with an advertisement agency . Selected
marketing agencies were invited to make an o ﬀer on providing a visual look for theHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 451
intervention as well as designing catchy poster slogans to support memorability of the
central messages. A shortlist of agencies was then invited to pitch their team and ideas.
They were assessed by a minimum of 3 team members for several dimensions, e.g. theirability to produce credible content for the target group, their understanding of social mar-keting principles and the value for money. The agency was required to meet with the youth
(student panel) at least twice to ensure target group input.
The research team supervised closely the advertisement agency ’s design work and made
sure that out of alternative designs and concepts, the ones aligned with the SDT and otherprinciples were selected for further development. For example, visual looks and concept
promoting an excessive focus on the looks and masculine muscular body were rejectedout of the interest to avoid unintended side-e ﬀects such as increasing dysfunctional
body dissatisfaction and thereby possible eating disorders or unhealthy ways of increasingmuscle mass.
Fortri-fold brochures that were to be set on the tables in school, e.g. cafeteria tables, we
designed content that would further target key determinants of student sessions. We usedthe writing contest stories as inspiration to model changing one ’s PA and coping with bar-
riers on the way. The aims, key messages and key BCTs used in these posters and bro-chures are presented in Supplementary Table S3 and S7.
To increase the appeal of the intervention to youth, we also reached out to celebrities
(e.g. comedians and musicians) that would be able to pose as champions and support themessages, but despite several contacts, and some candidates considering participation,
none of them volunteered in the end.
Home workout videos was one of the ways of increasing both opportunities and skills
for PA, with an instructor showing ways to conduct PA activities in the home environ-ment, without need for special equipment, suitable for people with varying levels of phys-
icalﬁtness. The production was manifold. First, a collaboration with a university of applied
sciences’ class resulted in sample exercises produced by the students within a course, then
two young personal trainers were asked to produce videos, but ﬁnally, the videos were
designed by an in-house sta ﬀmember (with master ’s degree in social psychology and
also a personal trainer certi ﬁcate). The videos were designed to allow ‘self-tailoring ’: the
5–10-minute videos could be combined to suit one’ s wishes and needs, and also, combined
with any music one prefers, as the video contained only some oral explanation in the back-ground (taking into account positive atmosphere and low-active youth ’s perspective).
The input of target group was relevant in all steps, also this one. For example, the
alternative intervention names were subject to student vote, leading to the selection ofthe name, Let ’s Move It.
Step 4. Empirical optimisation
In the feasibility trial, we detected high willingness of students to participate in the trial
and intervention, and acceptability of the concept (Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen, et al.,2017 ). We distinguished systematically issues requiring modi ﬁcation within the interven-
tion as well as in the research procedures (Bugge et al., 2013 ). The issues identi ﬁed and the
modiﬁcations carried out are reported in Supplementary Table 8.
We also speciﬁ ed more closely intervention behavioural objectives: For SB, for the
teacher intervention, these were breaking up sitting and reducing total amount of452 N. HANKONEN ET AL.
sedentary time in the classrooms. When assessing students about social cognitions relative
to these behaviours, we formulated the questions to refer to restricting i.e. limiting one ’sS B
(and not reducing one’ s SB). PE teachers ’feedback was taken into account to modify the
intervention so that it could be delivered by health and PE teachers, although in the
research, this was done by trained team members.
We also made adjustments based on what BCTs we envisaged the participants to ideally
enact and when (enactment ﬁdelity, Bellg et al., 2004). The table in Supplementary Figure
S2 was created in 2014 to help get insight on th e expectations for BCT enactment the inter-

Main conclusions from Step 4: The ﬁnal intervention
This paper elaborates the brief intervention description of the RCT trial protocol(Hankonen et al., 2016 ). In brief, the intervention included two main strategies targeting
motivation and capability –a poster campaign and a group programme with 6 small-
group sessions –and two main strategies targeting opportunity –classroom choice archi-
tecture and teacher-led active classroom practices. For the ﬁrst two strategies, central focus
was on PA, while for the latter two, focus was on reducing SB ( Figure 2 ).
Whereas PA is expected to change via a set of conscious motivational and self-regu-
lation processes (see Supplementary Figure S3), changes in SB were designed to be intro-duced ﬁrst and primarily by environment: changes in the physical choice architecture in
classrooms (e.g. gym balls as chairs) and teacher-led changes (e.g. active classroom prac-tices and activity breaks). In an intertwined way, the changed experience (due to themodiﬁed environment) would also later be accompanied with cognitive changes: Harms
of excessive SB and tips for reducing SB in one ’s daily life are presented in lessons,
reinforced by poster campaign and personal experiences of less sitting.
However, due to overlapping and intertwining nature of PA and reduction of SB the
group sessions also encouraged substituting sedentary activities with light PA (encoura-
ging even small improvements).
As a key parameter for autonomous motivation, interaction principles based on SDT
and (group) motivational interviewing were integral part of the group intervention.

They included e.g. showing empathy for the students, positive feedback, providing struc-
ture and agenda, as well as options and choices (see full list in (Hankonen et al., 2016 ) and
Supplementary Table S4). Making the activities in the group programme as participatory
as possible and giving voice to the students was considered another key parameter forautonomous motivation.
We consolidated the principles and ideas into six Let ’s Move It ‘theses ’or principles to
make it clear and transparent what the programme endorses, and what possible miscon-ceptions we are targeting (Supplementary Table S5). Finally, the ﬁnal form of the interven-
tion directed at students is described in the attached intervention description tables(Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). They include single behaviour change methods,tested in previous studies, to impact behaviour change, e.g. information about social
norms, implementation intentions (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006 ) and habit formation
(Gardner, Lally, & Wardle, 2012 ). We used existing practical applications, e.g. the voli-
tional help sheet (Armitage & Arden, 2010 ,2012 ), and also we developed a set of our
own individual exercises. As an example, a group task, named ‘Identifying Personal
Motives Group Activity ’, allowed sharing and learning from peers ’views on the beneﬁ ts
of PA and re ﬂecting on their personal relevance. Another example was ‘Coping Plan Con-
sultants ’where students, in small groups, discuss imaginary adolescents ’cases, to identify
barriers to regular PA and collaboratively come up with solutions for these problems
(coping planning/problem solving). These both exercises worked well and are describedin detail in (Hankonen, Heino, Hynynen, et al., 2017 ) and Supplementary Table S6.
Further discussion exercises target e.g. PA-related identity and self-perception, miscon-ceptions of PA, as well as critical analysis of ‘ﬁtspiration posters ’(see supplementary
materials). Importantly, students were taught about motivation and behaviour change
as well as how they themselves can play an active role therein (for a translated sheet
from the workbook, see Supplementary Figure S4). All intervention materials are pub-lished in www.letsmoveit.ﬁ
We took learnings from previous similar studies (see Hynynen et al., 2016 ). For
example, Lubans and Sylva ( 2009 ) note that instead of intense interventions delivered
by highly trained personnel in controlled settings, programmes should be realistic andsituation speciﬁ c, suitable for the school environment and designed to be implemented
by teachers. Similarly, another trial evaluation (Mauriello et al., 2006 ) suggested interven-
tion adjuncts such as a workbook or booster sessions to be useful in sustaining interven-tion eﬀ ects. Thus, we incorporated student workbook and booster session in the ﬁnal
intervention, as well as a teacher manual for teachers.
Discussion
This study described the phased development of a multi-level intervention programme,
guided by the MRC framework on intervention development, the BCW as well as elements
from the IM approach. The studies identi ﬁed a range of relevant determinants to target in
the intervention, in addition to identifying relevant BCTs. The ﬁnal intervention was based
mainly on SDT, self-regulation and control theories, with elements from the RAA, andconsisted of two main parts, an individual-level intervention targeting autonomous motiv-ation and imparting key self-regulatory skills that increased the capability of the student toincrease PA, and a sitting reduction workshop intervention for their teachers, as well as454 N. HANKONEN ET AL.
other environmental changes. The activities and change methods were described in this
paper and the extensive supplementary ﬁles.
This study is innovative in reporting the behavioural scienti ﬁc development process in a
detailed way, which is often called for but rarely done. The strengths of this project are (a)
a sound basis on a systematic behavioural analysis synthesising previous research as well as
qualitative and quantitative original research, (b) using systematically mapped, evidence-
based strategies to in ﬂuence behaviours (BCTs), including an explicit focus on also partici-
pants ’enactment of BCTs, (c) co-creation and pre-testing together with target group, (d)
using also ‘best practices ’from the ﬁeld, (e), targeting multiple levels of the system, (f) early
on involving stakeholders and policy makers regarding the future dissemination andimplementation and (g) conducting a step-wise design and development.
The process highlighted the relevance of behaviour change expertise. We recommend
active hands-on work and being explicit about the principles of behaviour change with theadvertisement and marketing professionals when producing intervention materials, so as
to ensure the realisation of behavioural science principles in a most optimal way. It is
common knowledge that to create implementable, acceptable and e ﬀective interventions,
participant engagement in development is vital. However, the potential pitfall is that targetgroups are usually not experts in behaviour change –therefore, important decisions
should not fully be left to the target group. For example, voting about the programmename can be left to targets, whereas BCT selection and combination should be informedby behaviour change science expertise. Yet, it should be noted that the LMI leaves quite a
bit of tailoring and ‘personalisation ’within the intervention (as opposed to rigid non-
adaptive intervention content or the other extreme, fully participatory development in
each local context). For example, for the students, concrete PA plans are personalised
to each individual and location, and the school sta ﬀare encouraged to select suitable
activities out of a large menu of options, able thereby to decide the best choice for their
context and situation, to realise the programme goal.
Studies informing the development were all designed to be ﬁt for purpose, and fed into
the intervention. Intervention development necessitates creativity, to come up with enga-ging and enjoyable ways to deliver e ﬀective BCTs in synergistic combinations, with e.g.
gamiﬁcation elements in face-to-face group setting. With several people immersed in the
topic of youth PA and SB, unplanned innovations occurred –as an example, a sociological
theory discovered during the write-up of the writing competition narratives was used as acore of a discussion exercise targeting rigid non-PA identities in the student sessions.
We have shed light on how intervention development necessarily involves painful
decisions, as not all determinants can be targeted e ﬀectively nor can all potentially
eﬀective strategies be used due to resources or real-world constraints. It was useful to
apply decision-making criteria across di ﬀerent steps, including considerations about inter-
vention features. For example, balancing between e ﬀective features (e.g. higher dose and
speciﬁ c intervention content) vs. costs (a ﬀordability).
Intervention ﬁdelity is a key aspect of interventions but often overlooked (Toomey
et al., 2020 ). We considered di ﬀerent aspects of ﬁdelity during the development of this
intervention, and ways to ensure ﬁdelity. Too often, ﬁdelity is only conceptualised as inter-
vention delivery (Toomey et al., 2020 ). An innovative part of the Let ’s Move It develop-
ment process was the attempt to consider the enactment aspect in detail: For example,
we
identi ﬁed BCTs with sub-optimal enactment during the feasibility study (Hankonen,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 455
Heino, Hynynen, et al., 2017 ), and outlined expected BCT enactment from the perspective
of participants (Supplementary Figure S2) to help identify possibly too high burden on the
participants. We recommend developers to consider what the key self-enactable BCTs arethat participants of universal interventions are prompted to enact, and when and howoften. This may help improve ways to ensure enactment ﬁdelity, as well as purposefully
assess it.
There are several limitations. Optimally, the project would have allowed more time to
optimise the intervention to support PA maintenance, and more systematic ways of incor-
porating injury prevention components. After the feasibility study and its 6 month follow-
up, there was only 3 months until the start of the actual de ﬁnitive trial, and with changes in
staﬀ, at this stage we were aware that time resources to produce components to promote
longer-term maintenance were suboptimal. Also, the student intervention was deliveredby research sta ﬀ, even though optimally, more time would have allowed producing an
additional intervention to train teachers to deliver the intervention and also activities to
truly promote and support sustainable organisational change (and created a true e ﬀective-
ness trial), but this was not possible given project funding constraints.
It should also be noted that despite the theories informing the intervention suggest
dynamical, complex processes, the simpli ﬁed pictorial representation of the intervention
theory reduces these to static, linear and one-way relationships (see e.g. Rogers, 2008 ).
As a limitation, we did not include explicitly possible emergent processes or draw feedback
loops. What is necessary simpli ﬁcation in terms of clarity and communication, and what is
too much, in terms of losing sight of important complexities that need to be captured accu-rately? Future work will hopefully enable ways to create of programme theories that willcapture also more complex aspects of interventions (Rogers, 2008 ).
It should be noted that the evidence statements collated ( Table 2 ) are simply a selection
and not a comprehensive list of all learned content. Often during the intervention devel-opment process, evidence statements were implicitly considered (based on the studies),but they were not always formulated as explicit sentences or summaries. Furthermore,
the team wrote internal reports and memos, some of which were in Finnish. In hindsight,
more transparent reporting and thinking at each stage would have been welcome. We rec-ommend that other intervention developers in the future publish their memos and interim
reports (in line with recommendations, e.g. Bartholomew Eldrigde et al., 2016 ), and also
consider doing this during the process openly, for example in the Open Science Frame-
work, and collate key learnings regularly, during completion of di ﬀerent steps. This will
help make the learning and progress explicit not only to the development team, butalso to outsiders, who could even be invited to provide timely feedback to contribute tointervention development.
The study has several strengths: It demonstrates that it is possible to use a systematic
and evidenced-based approach to intervention development and stakeholder co-creationintegrating key principles from IM and BCW. Drawing from the strengths of each inter-vention development framework, we followed a more parsimonious intervention develop-
ment process in line with the funding time and resources constraints. The frameworks and
theories were a necessary backbone for the development, although adjustments and iter-ations needed to be made. The initial form of BCW in 2013 was complemented well by the
IM’s detailed tips for various aspects of the development process.456 N. HANKONEN ET AL.
Conclusions
Interventions to target those from a lower educated background should be systematically
developed, with good pre-testing, to target this speci ﬁc group ’s needs and contextual con-
straints, prior to a full trial. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that the process of
intervention development, for such a target sample, is systematically described alongsideits feasibility test and further intervention re ﬁnement. This paper demonstrates how a sys-
tematic evidence synthesis, original research, theory and empirical optimisation informedthe development and co-creation with stakeholder engagement of a complex intervention.We transparently show intervention content in detail, linking hypothesised behavioural
determinants to the change techniques, and the innovative new group exercises that
had high acceptability among vocational school youth.
