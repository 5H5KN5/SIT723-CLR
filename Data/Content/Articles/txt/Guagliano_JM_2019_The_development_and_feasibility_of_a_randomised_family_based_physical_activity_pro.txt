Abstract
Background: There is a need for high-quality research aiming to increase physical activity in families. This study
assessed the feasibility and acceptability of FRESH (Families Reporting Every Step to Health), a child-led family-
based physical activity intervention delivered online.
Methods: In a two-armed randomised feasibility study, 12 families (with an 8 –10-year-old index child) were allocated
to a ‘child-only ’(CO) or ‘family ’arm (FAM) of the theory-based FRESH intervention. Both received access to the FRESH
website, allowing participants to select step challenges to ‘travel ’to target cities around the world, log their steps, and
track their progress as they virtually globetrot. Only index children wore pedometers in CO; in FAM, all family members
wore pedometers and worked towards collective goals. All family members were eligible to participate in the
evaluation. Mixed-methods process evaluation (questionnaires and family focus groups) at 6-week follow-up consisted
of completing questionnaires assessing acceptability of the intervention and accompanying effectiveness evaluation,
focussed on physical (e.g. fitness, blood pressure), psychosocial (e.g. social support), and behavioural (e.g. objectively-
measured family physical activity) measures.
Results: All families were retained (32 participants). Parent s enjoyed FRESH and all children found it fun. More FAM
children wanted to continue with FRESH, found the website easy to use, and enjoyed wearing pedometers. FAM
children also found it easier to reach goals. Most CO families would have preferred whole family participation. Compared
to CO, FAM exhibited greater website engagement as they travelled to more cities (36 ± 11 vs. 13 ± 8) and failed fewer
challenges (1.5 ± 1 vs. 3 ± 1). Focus groups also revealed that most families wanted elements of competition. All children
enjoyed being part of the evaluation, and adults disagreed that there were too many intervention measures (overall,
2.4 ± 1.3) or that data collection took too long (overall, 2.2 ± 1.1).
Conclusion: FRESH was feasible and acceptable to participating families; however, findings favoured the FAM group.
Recruitment, intervention fidelity and delivery and some measurement procedures are particular areas that require
further attention for optimisation. Testing the preliminary e ffectiveness of FRESH on family physical activity is a necessary
next step.

Introduction
Recent systematic reviews confirm numerous health
benefits of regular physical activity for children [ 1,2].
Nevertheless, approximately 80% of children in the UK
do not meet the recommended 60 min of moderate-
to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) every day
[3]. Additionally, as children become less active in
adolescence [ 4], there is a need for physical activity pro-
motion [ 5,6]. Observational data indicates that children
are less active after school and at weekends, compared
to while at school [ 7–9]. To date, however, physical ac-
tivity promotion efforts have been conducted predomin-
antly in the school setting, despite the impact of these
school-based interventions on overall physical activity
being questioned [ 10]. Family-based physical activity in-
terventions may therefore present a promising avenue to
promote children ’s activity [ 11].
Previous evidence indicates that home-based physical
activity interventions are potentially more effective than
those requiring the family to travel to community or
other intervention locations [ 12,13]. Further, it is un-
likely that a change in children ’s physical activity levels
will be sustained long-term without the involvement of
wider family members [ 14–16]. Many studies, however,
only focus on promoting child physical activity instead
of considering the family as a unit that may work to-
gether to change behaviour [ 17].
Calls for physical activity research in young people and
families highlight the dearth of research in this area [ 18]
and the need to develop and evaluate innovative interven-
tions targeting children and families. Responding to this
challenge, in this paper, we (1) describe the development
of the Families Reporting Every Step to Health (FRESH)
intervention and recruitment strategy; (2) assess the feasi-
bility and acceptability of the FRESH recruitment strategy,
intervention (including intervention fidelity), and accom-
panying outcome evaluation; and (3) explore how FRESH
could be optimised through a mixed-methods process
evaluation.
Methods
Reporting of this study was guided by the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials extension to randomised
pilot and feasibility trials guidelines [ 19] and the Template
for Intervention Description and Replication [ 20]. This
feasibility study received ethical approval from the Ethics
Committee for the School of the Humanities and SocialSciences at the University of Cambridge and was pro-
spectively registered (ISRCTN12789422).
Study design —overview
FRESH was a 6-week two-armed, parallel-group, rando-
mised feasibility study, using a 1:1 allocation ratio, aim-
ing to recruit 20 families with an index child aged 8 –10
years. Following baseline assessment, families were ran-
domly allocated to one of two intervention arms. In the
‘child-only ’arm, the index child was the focus of the inter-
vention, with family members simply providing support. In
contrast, in the ‘family ’arm, all participating family mem-
bers received the FRESH intervention (described later).
An independent statistician performed the randomisa-
tion procedure in Stata (version 14; StataCorp. TX: Sta-
taCorp LP) using a computer-generated algorithm and a
randomised block design (blocks of 4) to ensure equal
numbers in each condition.
Participants
Families were eligible to participate when at least one
child aged 8 –10 years (hereafter referred to as index chil-
dren) and at least one adult responsible for their care and
living in their main household provided consent. Partici-
pants also needed to be able to partake in light-intensity
physical activity (e.g. walking), have access to the Internet,
and have a sufficient understanding of the English lan-
guage. No restrictions were placed on family type (e.g. sin-
gle parent, inclusion of grandparents, siblings). All other
family members living in the index child ’s main household
were invited to participate but their participation was not
required. Additionally, intervention and evaluation partici-
pation were separate; family members could take part in
the intervention irrespective of participation in the accom-
panying evaluation and vice versa. Specific exclusion cri-
teria only applied to the evaluation of this study and are
outlined below.
Setting
Families were recruited from rural Norfolk, a county in
East Anglia, UK. Norfolk is 2074 mile2and has a total esti-
mated population of 898,400 [ 21], about half of which live
rurally [ 22], where rural-urban disparities in physical ac-
tivity have been previously reported [ 9,23]. In accordance
with the Office for National Statistics [ 24] classification,
‘rural ’was defined as having a postcode falling in a small
town, village, hamlet, or dispersed settlement.Guagliano et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:21 Page 2 of 15
Recruitment
Formative work informing the development of the FRESH
recruitment strategy
The recruitment of families is known to be particularly
challenging, and there is little evidence to suggest how best
to engage families in physical activity research [ 14,25]. To
inform recruitment and retention, focus groups were con-
ducted with 17 families (82 participants, consisting of 2 –6
family members) [ 26]. Findings suggested (1) using a
multi-faceted recruitment strategy and (2) highlighting the
wide range of benefits of research participation (particu-
larly social, health, and educational outcomes). These
lessons explicitly contributed to the planned recruitment
strategies for the current study, where we planned school-
and community-based (e.g. Brownies/Cubs, community
centres, GP practices) recruitment, highlighting the bene-
fits of spending time together as a family in our recruit-
ment material.
Recruitment protocol
To recruit schools and community-based organisations,
we first contacted lead personnel (e.g. head teachers, phys-
ical education coordinators, heads of community-based
organisations) by sending an information pack detailing
the purpose of the study and all procedures, followed by a
phone call if no response was obtained. Verbal or written
approval was sought to send home study leaflets to chil-
dren, circulate our leaflet to parents online, and send an
online reminder to parents approximately 2 weeks later.
In schools, we also sought permission to present to year
3–5 students at a scheduled assembly. Next, interested
parents contacted the study team via e-mail or Freephone,
after which eligibility was assessed and study information
emailed. A baseline assessment appointment was then
made with those families still interested in participating.
Written informed consent was obtained for participating
adults and written parental consent and child assent for
each participating child prior to baseline assessments.
Intervention selection and development
Reviewing the literature
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
and found a small, but significant, effect favouring the
experimental groups of family-based interventions com-
pared to controls (Cohen ’sd= 0.41; 95% CI 0.15 –0.67)
[27]. This review highlighted the scarcity of family-based
intervention studies that (1) clearly indicated intended
behaviour change mechanisms, (2) employed objective
measures of physical activity, (3) engaged with/assessed
intervention effects on wider family members, and (4)
were theory-based. The development of the FRESH
intervention was then informed by a programme theory
for family-based physical activity interventions [ 27]. This
highlighted the value of (1) using goal-setting combinedwith reinforcement in the context of family constraints
(e.g. lack of time or scheduling difficulties), (2) focussing
on changing the family psychosocial environment (e.g.
using the child as agent of change), and (3) focussing on
something other than the health benefits of physical ac-
tivity (e.g. time together as a family). These collective
findings were considered when developing the FRESH
intervention.
Intervention selection
Four potential intervention concepts were developed fol-
lowing initial work [ 26]. The four concepts were as
follows: (1) Buddy scheme : Families would be paired or
grouped to facilitate peer support for physical activity.
(2)Small changes : Providing a resources toolkit to each
family, containing information on making small changes
to increase physical activity (e.g. active travel sugges-
tions, such as getting off the bus a stop early). (3) Sports
equipment library :A‘travelling library ’of a large range
of sporting equipment would move through a commu-
nity once a week allowing families to borrow equipment.
(4) Family challenge: Families would be framed as a
‘team ’, working towards a common goal (e.g. an overall
step count to ‘walk around the world ’).
These four concepts were then brought to families
during a university-run community engagement event
where children acted as researchers to identify which
their family would enjoy most, and further refined dur-
ing meetings with stakeholders (i.e. parents, teachers,
family health practitioner). This led to the selection of
an intervention that allowed families to work as a ‘team ’,
tracking their efforts towards a common goal, and re-
ceiving small rewards for progress ( family challenge
from above). This initial input from families and stake-
holders was used as a starting point to develop FRESH
in its current form.
FRESH intervention description and protocol
In brief, FRESH was primarily a goal-setting and self-
monitoring intervention aimed at increasing physical
activity in whole families. The Socio-Ecological Model
(individual and interpersonal levels) [ 28] and Family
Systems Theory [ 29] provided a framework for the inter-
vention components. Within this framework, behaviour
change strategies were guided by Self-Determination
Theory [ 30]. A detailed description of the FRESH inter-
vention components and associated behaviour change
techniques, targeted Self-Determination Theory constructs,
and hypothesised mediators are in Table 1. Additionally,

A week after baseline measures, a facilitator visited all
families for a ‘kick-off ’meeting to introduce families to
the intervention components and accompanying materials
(e.g. family action planner). The main purpose of thisGuagliano et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:21 Page 3 of 15
meeting was to familiarise families with the website and
prompt families to schedule regular ‘family time ’meetings
(minimum 1/week) where they reviewed and updated
their family action planner. All meetings occurred in
participating families ’home and lasted approximately an
hour. Participant-initiated distant support was available
for the duration of the intervention.
A detailed description of the FRESH intervention com-
ponents can be found in Table 1. At the start of each new
weekly challenge, families had family time, where they se-
lected a challenge on the FRESH website and filled in their
action planners. The FRESH website allowed families to
choose one of three target cities to ‘walk to ’each week
with the aim to eventually ‘walk ’around the world. The
FRESH website primarily facilitated the self-monitoring of
step counts and goal-setting through selecting challenges
of varying difficulty. In both study conditions, children
were allocated the role of ‘team captain ’, leading on destin-
ation selection and uploading steps online. Families were
to wear their pedometers for as long as possible daily to
capture their steps and asked to upload step counts at
least once weekly. After completing a challenge, families
received effort-praising messages and virtual rewards (i.e.
virtual passport stamps), as well as track their progress
around the world and access reinforcement materials on
the FRESH website (i.e. interactive information about the
cities they have walked past during their challenge). If a
family did not complete a challenge, to praise their effort,
they progressed to a hidden city along their challenge
route and still received a supportive message, virtual pass-
port stamp, and access reinforcement materials. Complet-
ing a challenge (or if the week ended) incited the next
family time meeting, where the above cycle was repeated
(see cycle in Fig. 1).
Refining the FRESH intervention
The FRESH intervention as initially developed was fur-
ther developed through public involvement activities.
We sought input from children ( n= 7) through a
talk-aloud session regarding the layout and design of the
FRESH website and also from families ( n= 2) who
pilot-tested the intervention protocol described above.
Overall, the FRESH intervention was well received, chil-
dren found the website easy to navigate, and no changes
were made to the protocol. However, based on partici-
pants ’suggestions, minor changes were made to the
intervention website. For example, participants found it
discouraging when they participated in activities that
could not be captured by their pedometers (e.g. swim-
ming). Therefore, we added a ‘step calculator ’to the
website that enabled participants to estimate the number
of steps various activities, such as swimming, would give
them, using data from a readily available activity-to-step
converter online [ 31].Outcome evaluation measures
As part of this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility and
acceptability of the planned outcome evaluation (i.e. not
effectiveness); therefore, here we briefly describe the mea-
sures included to provide an overview of what the
outcome evaluation entails. Table 2outlines the measures
taken, including assessment order and estimated duration.
Data collection was carried out by two trained research
staff in participating families ’homes. Outcomes were
assessed at baseline (prior to randomisation) and follow-up
(6 weeks) on all participating family members (excluding
children ≤2 years). All consenting family members took
part in measurements, irrespective of intervention alloca-
tion and participation.
Physical activity and location
To assess individual physical act ivity, and family co-partici-
pation in physical activity, participants were asked to simul-
taneously wear an ActiGraph GT3X+ tri-axial
accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC ; Pensacola, Florida) and
QStarz Travel Recorder BT1000X global positioning system
(GPS) monitor (QStarz; Taipei , Taiwan). Participants wore
the monitors affixed at each hip on an elastic belt during
waking hours for 7 consecutive days. A valid week was de-
fined as ≥600 min/day from 3 weekdays and 1 weekend
day over the 7-day measurement period [ 32]. Non-wear
was defined as ≥90 min consecutive zeros using vector
magnitude. ActiGraph accelerometers have been shown to
be valid and reliable devices for the measurement of phys-
ical activity levels in children and adults [ 33–35]; the GPS
monitor used has been shown to have high static and
dynamic validity in a variety of settings [ 36].
Accelerometer and GPS data were matched using Java,
after which data points that had a time difference of ≤
30 s between the accelerometer timestamp and that of
its matched GPS location were considered valid for in-
clusion. Matched data points with a time difference
greater than this, for example where the GPS was
switched off or had lost signal, were considered as miss-
ing locational information because the participant might
have moved to a new unrecorded location. From the
matched data, we computed minutes per day that the
GPS had maintained a signal and was therefore record-
ing the participants ’location, as an indicator of data
completeness. Only wear time data will be presented in
the current paper; therefore, we have only provided
information relevant to estimating wear time using both
monitors.
Health outcomes
Aerobic fitness was measured using an 8-min submaxi-
mal step test [ 37]. Children < 8 years were excluded from
the aerobic fitness test. Height, weight, waist circumfer-
ence, and blood pressure (OMRON 705IT) wereGuagliano et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:21 Page 4 of 15

1. Family time Minimum
1×/week,
10–20 min‘Family time ’provided an opportunity for index childrena
and family members to plan PA, monitor their week ’s steps,
and discuss any potential PA barriers and strategies to over
come them by logging in their family action planners [ 27].
Regular family time was hypothesised to provide index
children with:
A consistent (re)structured environment, where family
members supported index children in choosing an
optimally challenging and realistic goal (reflected as
an easy, moderate, or difficult challenge on the FRESH
website), breaking down goals into proximal (daily)
and distal (weekly) step count targets, and providing
praise and positive feedback on progress towards those
goals. These strategies provide direct support for
participants ’perceived competence [ 70].
Consistent parental involvement which directly facilitates
relatedness [ 70]. Parental involvement (via co-participation
in PA) may also positively affect family connectedness [ 71].
An opportunity for consistent autonomy support. Autonomy
support has been shown to directly support participants ’
autonomy and indirectly support their basic needs for
competence and relatedness [ 72].
Additionally, index children were named their family ’s team
captain (i.e. change agent) where they were in charge of
initiating ‘family time ’. Evidence suggests that children may
elicit changes to the psychosocial environment [ 27]; therefore,
promoting the index children to the role of family ‘team
captain ’may strengthen child buy-in, perceived autonomy,
and improve intervention fidelity.Goal-setting

FRESH website allowed families to choose one of three target
cities to ‘walk to ’weekly, with the aim to eventually ‘walk ’
around the world. Each week, families chose an easy, moderate,
or difficult challenge, which represented a 0%, 5%, or 10%
increase, respectively, relative to the average steps they had
taken in preceding weeks. Increases were adjusted to 0%, 2.5%,
and a 5% once adults and children accumulating an average of
10,000 and 12,000 steps/day, respectively. Families also had access
to a general resources area with s uggestions for activities that
families could do together and a map for a visual representation
of the locations families have travelled to.Goal-setting

to use and convenient and are associated with effective
interventions for increasing parent-child physical activity [ 73].
Index children logged their steps (and their family members ’
steps) into the FRESH website and/or onto the family action
planners, which allowed participants to view their progress

cities around the world. Participants received 2 –4 passport

measured according to standardised operating proce-
dures. Body mass index was calculated and converted
into age- and sex-specific percentiles using standard
growth charts for children [ 38].
Behavioural and psychosocial measures
Questionnaires assessed behavioural and psychosocial mea-
sures: adult and child screen-time use [ 39–42]; quality of
life [43–46]; family co-participation in physical activity [ 42];
physical activity awareness [ 47,48]; family social norms for
physical activity [ 49,50]; family support [ 49]; children ’sa n d
adult ’s motivation for physical activity [ 51,52]; children ’s
perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness [ 52];
and family functioning [ 53]. Children ≤4 years did not
complete this questionnaire.
Family functioning
The Fictional Family Holiday paradigm, a 10-min video-re-
corded activity where families were asked to write out aweek-long holiday itinerary with unlimited budget, was
used to assess family functioning via family relationships
[53] and connectedness [ 54]. This is because the activity
requires ‘power sharing ’(i.e. taking turns) and prompts the
viewpoints of all family members on the topic, eliciting
both individuality (through suggestions for destinations/ac-
tivities or disagreements) and connectedness (through
agreements, questions, or initiating compromise) contrib-
uting to the family ’s final plan [ 53].
Family out-of-pocket expenditure for physical activity
Family expenditure related to physical activity was col-
lected via a questionnaire that was developed and tested
for the current study and completed by one adult for
their whole family. The questionnaire comprised two
questions about expenditure related to membership fees
and subscriptions (e.g. for sports clubs, fitness centres)
and sports equipment (e.g. sportswear, gadgets).
Process evaluation
A mixed-methods process evaluation was conducted at the
end of the 6-week intervention. Adults self-reported their
overall opinion of FRESH, their opinion of the intervention
components and measurements, and suggestions for im-
provement using opened-ended and 5-point Likert-scale
questions (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Chil-
dren also self-reported on the above topics, responding to
dichotomous ‘yes/no ’questions. Semi-structured focus
groups were also conducted with 11/12 families (1 family
declined participation) focussing on families ’perceived
acceptability of individual FRESH intervention compo-
nents, intervention fidelity, challenges/barriers engaging
with FRESH, and suggested improvements. The mean
focus group duration was 34 ± 10 min (range = 17 –50 min).
All focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed
verbatim.Table 2 Order of measures and estimated duration of data

Data analysis
Quantitative data
Frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations
were calculated to describe data related to recruitment,
retention, fidelity, intervention optimisation, website en-
gagement, and outcome measures.
Qualitative data
Using a long table approach, a content analysis was con-
ducted using existing guidelines [ 55]. Specifically, the
analysis was conducted in two separate phases. During
the data organisation phase, text from each transcript
was divided into segments (meaning units) to produce a
set of concepts that reflected meaningful pieces of infor-
mation [ 55]. Tags were then assigned to each meaning
unit. Tagging was performed by one researcher, with a
second double-tagging ~ 25% of transcripts. For the data
interpretation phase, the inventory of tags from all tran-
scripts was examined by two researchers, which led to
the emergence of themes and sub-themes within each
overarching category.
Results
Findings related to recruitment and retention
Only school-based recruitment was employed due to
intervention development delays. Of the 11 schools
approached, 3 declined (too busy: n= 2; doing enough
physical activity promotion already, n= 1) and 3 did not
respond. Five schools with an estimated 437 eligible stu-
dents agreed (reach).
Figure 2shows the participant flow from the number of
families assessed for eligibility through to analysis. Of those
reached, 6.4% (i.e. 28 families) expressed interest; initial
interest came from 23 mothers and 5 fathers. Expressions
of interest occurred at a rate of 3 –4 families/week or 5 –6
families/school assembly conducted. Less than half of those
families who expressed interest ( n= 28 families) partici-
pated in FRESH ( n= 12 families) and were enrolled at a
rate of 1 –2 families/week. All families were retained at
follow-up.
Of the 12 families enrolled, 4 were whole families and
6 were dyads (i.e. one parent and one index child); 32
family members participated overall. About 2 –3 family
members took part per family (range = 2 –4); 4 families
had an eligible additional adult, 3 families had an eligible
additional child, and 1 family had both. Table 3describes
the participant characteristics.
After asking families about perceived challenges, focus
groups revealed 4 challenges to be considered for opti-
mising future recruitment. A brief description of the
challenges is provided below, with supporting quotes in
Table 4(a–d).Children trying to convey what FRESH was to parents
Delivering school assemblies emerged as an effective
strategy for captivating children ’s interest in FRESH, so
much so that it appeared to be the main reason parents
expressed interested in participating. However, children
struggled, or were unable, to explain what FRESH was to
their parents, likely impacting on the recruitment of the
family unit.
Participation would be time consuming
Parents suggested that one of the main barriers was the
perception that participation in FRESH would be bur-
densome and time consuming. However, participating
parents reported that FRESH participation did not im-
pede upon their normal daily activities.
Lack of confidence for physical activity
One family suggested a major challenge in recruiting
families in their county might be due to a high preva-
lence of obesity, where they suggested families would be
reluctant to register for a physical activity intervention
due to a lack of confidence.
Reluctance to being measured
It was also confirmed that some family members chose
not to participate in FRESH because they did want to
participate in measurement sessions.
Families also suggested strategies, via focus groups, for
improved recruitment, which included the following: a
return visit to schools to give parents an opportunity to
hear about FRESH and ask questions; exploring recruit-
ment strategies that targeted adults through formal (e.g.
employers) or informal settings (e.g. clubs, local fetes,
shopping centres); using social media, such as Facebook
or Twitter; and providing endorsements from previous
participants or familiar organisations.
Findings related to intervention feasibility, acceptability,
fidelity, and optimisation
Feasibility and acceptability of FRESH
All children reported that they liked taking part in
FRESH and thought it was fun. Table 5(a) shows adults ’
overall perceptions of FRESH. Scores were generally
positive. In particular, adults agreed that FRESH was
fun, encouraged their family to do more physical activity,
and made their family more aware of the amount of
physical activity they do, which was confirmed in focus
groups (see Table 4e). Goal-setting also emerged as a
major theme, particularly in those randomised to the
family arm. Participants (adults and children) were
aware of their required daily step counts to complete
their weekly challenge and were able to identify ways to
accumulate additional steps to meet daily targets (e.g.
active travel; see Table 4e). Participants also reportedGuagliano et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:21 Page 7 of 15
receiving socio-emotional (e.g. feeling ‘closer ’as a family)
and perceived cognitive benefits (e.g. in index child ’s
maths ability) through their participation. Lastly, all 6
families allocated into the child-only arm demonstrated
a clear preference to have their whole family involved in
FRESH. This finding was particularly evident among
fathers (see Table 4e).Intervention fidelity
Using a 5-point Likert-scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5
= strongly agree), all families felt the kick-off meeting
was useful (family vs child-only: 4.4 ± 0.8; 4.5 ± 0.8)
and appreciated that it was a face-to-face meeting as
opposed to a phone or video meeting. Most families
felt they had enough technical support (3.9 ± 1.5, 4.2
± 1.0), and the majority of families stated that a single
meeting was enough for them to understand the
protocol and how to use intervention website and ma-
terials. However, two families would have liked a
follow-up meeting the following week.
Family time Overall, adults disagreed that children led or
reminded them of family time (see Table 5b). In line with
the adult data, the majority of children did not perceive
themselves to be their family ’s team captain to lead on
family time. Several children cited that they forgot they
were team captain or they could not be bothered to be the
team captain. There was also evidence to suggest that
some parents took over the team captain role.
Overall, adults reported that it was not particularly
easy for their family to schedule family time or to have it
consistently. Most families claimed they either rarely orTable 3 Individual participant characteristics at baseline

never had family time. A lack of time was the most com-
monly cited challenge for not having family time. Also,
for some, parents ’work schedule (i.e. shift work) made it
difficult to organise family time with all family members
present. However, focus group evidence shows that some
families were having discussions about physical activityin a manner that would be unlikely prior to FRESH (see
Table 4f).
Generally, families only used their action planners to log
daily step counts and not to plan weekly activities or an-
ticipate barriers to meeting step goals. Most families pre-
ferred writing their step counts out on their paper-basedTable 4 Supporting quotes from family focus groups

a) Children trying to convey what
FRESH was to parents“I guess because you did it in assemblies, I wasn ’t sure what he was going on about. It wasn ’t till [J –a
mother of a participating family] had obviously been in touch with you that we found out more. But
going back to the whole thing of trying to then explain [FRESH], if the kids cannot do it, it becomes sort
of Chinese whispers between the parents, does not it? ”[Mother 7, family arm].
b) Participation would be time
consuming“I think people have misconceptions …I think they just heard the words research project and thought,
‘oh no, we are going to have to do a load of stuff ’…but you do not have to do anything, just wearing
this [pedometer] and going about what I do normally and log on the website every night or a couple of
times a week and have a look at how we are doing. I did not think it was a hassle at all. ”[Father 5, child-
only arm].
c) Lack of confidence for physical
activity“Exercise is a funny thing, you know... Like if they are overweight or they do not eat healthy …they may
think they are being judged by it and actually they are not being judged by it at all. That ’s not what this
was about... but there ’s a fear factor when it comes to exercise for some people …. And given that I think
obesity levels are pretty high around here for the national average, I think West Norfolk ’s one of the fatter
areas, people may be a bit... I do not know, possibly there was lack of confidence about signing up to
something like this. ”[Mother 5, child-only arm].
d) Reluctance to being measured “It was the measurements, I would ’ve done the other stuff …I think with some people that just puts you
off straightaway. I think it did for me …I was like ‘no, I do not want to do that ’and I am sure others felt
the same. Luckily [I - Father] did not mind because she really wanted to do this. ”[Mother 12, family arm].

e) Feasibility and acceptability of
FRESH“Definitely more aware, I underlined that [on the process evaluation questionnaire] because I think in terms
of our awareness, it has made us a lot more aware of the steps that we are doing. I really, really liked that,
for me that has been the best thing. ”[Father 6, family arm].
“…you [speaking about index child] wanted to walk more did not you, like if we were going to nursery
you were like, ‘can I walk because I want to get more steps. ’I noticed that on a few things, whereas before
she would have been like, ‘oh, can we go in the car? ’”[Mother 12, family arm].
“I do think if you ’d given step counters to everyone in the family it gives us more onus to do it. Once
you ’d gone, it was all about him and no one else in the family, I felt like I ’d done my bit and it was all down
to just him and his step counter; whereas, if I ’d have had a step counter …for the 6 weeks I probably would
have been more aware about how active I was, and not necessarily competed with you, but just the fact that
I had my own one to keep an eye on how active I ’d been, then I ’d have probably felt more involved. ”[Father
8, child-only arm].
f) Family time “We would actually compare on a daily basis …we’d be like ‘who ’s done the most steps today? ’and you
know, ‘oh, you have done more than you normally do, [B –index child] ’or‘you have done less then you
normally do. ’So, we were able gauge, ‘oh, it ’s been a slow day, why has been it slow day? What have you
been doing at school today? ”[Father 6, family arm].
“We had the planner out the whole time in the kitchen, so it was easier to fill in. [B –index child] was
involved with it because, at the end of the day, I would say, ’have you written your log? ’And before bed she
would have a look and she would write her number down and [Father] and I would shout our numbers to her
and say, ‘oh this is mine, put mine in. ’”[Mother 6, family arm].
g) FRESH website “We pretty much just went on [the website] to log [steps] …I think we found that hardest thing, we would fall
out over whose going to log [on the website] …so that wasn ’t that helpful for the family dynamic (laughs). ”
[Father 6, family arm].
“Well I ’d like to have a leaderboard, that shows everyone doing it and it says, ‘you have got to beat this person
and their name ’, like it says on my football game. ”[Boy 5, child-only arm]. “Yeah, a family one would be good.
That would spur us all on would it not! It would spur us all on massively, yeah. ”[Father 5, child-only arm].
h) Rewards “He enjoyed that [virtual badges], but …maybe do a certificate or stickers or something, you know, even if you
posted one to them, so they receive the post and we could be like ‘oh yeah, look what you have done! ’
and …especially if you named it to them personally, so they actually got the physical post …‘I have got a
letter, I get to open that, wow, got my certificate in it! ”[Mother 3, family arm].Guagliano et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:21 Page 9 of 15
action planners and transferring them onto the FRESH
website once, near the end of their weekly challenge (see
Table 4f).
FRESH website Compared to the child-only arm, the
family arm exhibited greater website engagement as they
travelled to more cities (36 ± 11 vs. 13 ± 8) and failed
fewer challenges (1.5 ± 1 vs. 3 ± 1). All children in the
family arm and most (~ 80%) in the child-only arm
wanted to continue using the FRESH website. Children
in the family arm also found it easier to use the website,
compared to those in the child-only arm (83% vs. 60%).
Overall, adults ’mean scores were generally positive in
relation to the FRESH website (see Table 5c), although
more critical opinions were voiced during the focus
groups. For the majority of families, the extent of their
website engagement entailed selecting challenges and
logging steps, which was normally a task performed re-
luctantly by parents (see Table 4g). Many adults and
children were unaware or had not used several of the
website elements (e.g. step calculator, parent resources,
virtual rewards). Others stated that children were inter-
ested in the website (e.g. information about cities), but
that interest wore off and only an interest in accumulat-
ing steps remained.
Website technical issues arose, particularly with the al-
gorithm that calculated the number of steps families
needed to accumulate to complete their challenge. This
may have negatively affected some participants ’experi-
ence. Aside from technical bugs that needed resolving,
families provided input on other potential improvements
that could be made to the website. Almost unanimously,
families wanted an element of competition on the web-
site. It was evident from numerous focus groups that
within-family competition occurred throughout the dur-
ation of the intervention period. However, the ability to
compete against other families was also suggested in sev-
eral focus groups (see Table 4g). Other suggested website
improvement included: (1) adding a step history page to
enable families to view progression over the intervention
period, (2) more feedback/praise from the research team,
(3) more flexibility in challenge destinations, (4) sending
a text or e-mail reminder to log steps, and (5) an im-
proved website design.
Pedometers Overall acceptability of the pedometers was
high for adults in both arms (Table 5d). Generally, adults
stated that it became a ‘routine ’or ‘second nature ’to
wear pedometers, although some would have preferred
wrist-worn pedometers. The most frequently cited rea-
son children gave for wanting to participate in FRESH
was to receive a pedometer. Families reported that there
were few settings where children were not allowed to
wear their pedometers, with the most cited setting beingduring physical education. Pedometer wear was more ac-
ceptable to children in the family arm than the
child-only arm (~ 80% vs 60%).
Rewards Overall, parents moderately agreed that their
child enjoyed receiving virtual rewards (3.5 ± 1.2), with
slightly higher scores in the child-only arm compared to
the family arm (3.8 ± 1.0 vs. 3.1 ± 1.3). Children ’s focus
group responses generally supported parents ’percep-
tions that the virtual rewards were not particularly of
long-term interest to them. Most parents suggested a
small tangible reward would appeal to their child more
than a virtual reward, such as posted certificates or
stickers. Other suggestions included vouchers, clothing,
or equipment that encouraged physical activity (see
Table 4h).
Risk of contamination Focus groups revealed that chil-
dren were aware of other FRESH participants in their
school and that some families did indeed communicate
among each other about FRESH, with some even reveal-
ing their allocated condition. We also discovered that a
family allocated to the child-only arm purchased a set of
pedometers for their family.
Findings related to feasibility of outcome evaluation
Data collection took an average of 91.1 ± 27.7 min/family
at baseline and 77.1 ± 24.5 min/family at follow-up. Over-
all, adults disagreed that there were too many measures
and that data collection took too long and all children
self-reported that they ‘liked ’being measured. With the
exception of accelerometer/GPS and step test assessment
(1 refusal each), all participants completed all measures at
baseline. At follow-up, 91% of participants accepted an ac-
celerometer/GPS and completed the step test; 94% of par-
ticipants completed all other measures.
At baseline, valid accelerometer wear was 851.5 ± 54.1
and 755.7 ± 29.7 min for adults and children, respectively,
and 843.1 ± 78.6 and 742.3 ± 56.4 at follow-up, and the
GPS provided a location for 750.6 ± 191.4 and 646.2 ±
189.0 min at baseline and 720.0 ± 237.6 and 586.8 ± 262.8
at follow-up. Valid data on ≥4 days (including 1 weekend
day) was available for 83% of adults at baseline and
follow-up; this was slightly lower for children, at 75% and
67%. Visual inspection of wear time data revealed a ten-
dency for children to remove their devices around dinner
time, parents to remove their devices after their child went
to bed, and families to put on their devices much later in
the day at the weekend compared with weekdays.
Initial assessment of family functioning via the
video-recorded Fictional Family Holiday activity showed
poor-to-moderate data qualit y as discussions were limited
and cursory. Three factors may have affected data quality:
(1) most families enrolled were dyads, limitingGuagliano et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:21 Page 10 of 15
opportunities for whole-family discussion; (2) providing
families with a planner to write out their itinerary may
have shifted the emphasis away from open-ended discus-
sion; and (3) the activity was completed at the end of the
visit, when participants may have been fatigued from data
collection.
The physical activity-related expenditure questionnaire
developed for this study appeared to have appropriate
face validity and was capable of providing rich data re-
lated to membership fees and subscriptions (e.g. forsports clubs, fitness centres, after school clubs) and
sports equipment (e.g. sportswear, gadgets).
Discussion
The current study provides a response to calls for the need
for innovative interventions targeting young people and
families [ 18]. To our knowledge, FRESH is among the first
physical activity interventions to specifically target whole
family engagement, helping to create supportive, synergis-
tic environments for the promotion of healthy behavioursTable 5 Summary process evaluation findings for adult participants assessing the acceptability of the Families Reporting Every Step

and long-term change [ 11,17,27]. Here, we assessed the
feasibility and acceptability of FRESH to inform future re-
search. Our findings showed that it was feasible and ac-
ceptable to deliver and evaluate a family-targeted physical
activity promotion intervention with generally high accept-
ability from participating fam ilies. This feasibility study,
however, also revealed areas for improvement.
Optimising recruitment
Previous literature has identified family-based recruitment
as being particularly difficult [ 14,56]. Our formative work
[26]a n do t h e rs t u d i e s( s e ear e v i e wb yM o r g a ne ta l .[ 25])
recommend a multi-faceted recruitment strategy in family-
based research. Due to unforeseen delays, we were unable
to employ our planned multi-faceted recruitment strategy,
which likely contributed to our under-recruitment of fam-
ilies (60% of targeted 20). Of the families enrolled, only 1/3
included all family members. There was some suggestion
that this may have been due to a lack of confidence for
physical activity or a reluctance to be measured. Improved
messaging is therefore required early in the recruitment
process to reassure low-active families that FRESH is tai-
lored to their activity levels and highlight the option of opt-
ing out of (parts of) the measurements. Allowing family
members to be involved in the intervention, regardless of
their participation in the evaluation, may improve effective-
ness and long-term behaviour change [ 14–17].
Interestingly, our findings showed that fathers appeared
to be interested in participating in FRESH but only 5 out
of 28 expressions of interest were initiated by fathers. This
may be because, among heterosexual parents, tasks such
as making phone calls (e.g. to express interest) or family
event preparation (e.g. study participation) are more likely
to be performed by mothers than fathers [ 57]. Therefore,
recruiting whole families, where any parent could initiate
an expression of interest, may be an important catalyst for
the inclusion of more fathers in family-based research.
Other key areas of improvement to recruitment in-
clude the following: optimising the conversion from chil-
dren reached to expressions of interest (e.g. extending
the age range of index children to cover the whole of
key stage 2; reducing the burden on children to explain
FRESH, instead directing parents to a video); targeting
adults via community- and employer-based recruitment
or social media; and obtaining recruitment support from
local organisations.
Optimising the FRESH intervention
FRESH is designed as a goal-setting and self-monitoring
intervention aimed at increasing family physical activity.
Encouragingly, these behaviour change techniques reso-
nated with most families and align with recommendations
to increase family physical activity [ 27]. Participants re-
ported being aware of what their daily step goals neededto be in order to complete their weekly challenges. Inter-
estingly, the challenge context did not seem to be import-
ant to participating families (i.e. choosing challenge cities
to walk to virtually). Instead, focus group interviews re-
vealed that meeting daily step goals, completing weekly
challenges, and intra-family competition appeared to be
key drivers motivating families throughout the interven-
tion period.
We found that families were not implementing all inter-
vention components as intended and strategies to improve
intervention delivery and families ’fidelity to the interven-
tion protocol may be needed. For instance, most families
were not selecting new challenges on the FRESH website
together during family time, and families were only using
their action planners to log their steps, not to also identify
family activities or upcoming challenges for the week
ahead. During the kick-off meeting, the facilitator could
place a greater emphasis on family time and help the family
schedule it. Facilitators are critical to the delivery of inter-
ventions and a recent review found that facilitators have an
important moderating influence on the effectiveness of any
programme [ 58]. Ongoing follow-up with the facilitator
would also support this. Other strategies to improve
intervention fidelity include e-mail reminders to log steps,
adding competition elements to the website (e.g. a leader-
board), more regular feedback/praise from the research
team, and including small tangible rewards.
Although the FRESH intervention overall was well-re-
ceived, in our focus groups, it was evident that families
and, in particular, fathers in the child-only arm expressed
that they would have preferred having their whole family
involved in FRESH. Discontinuing this study arm should
therefore be considered. Further, the finding that fathers
were particularly interested in having their whole family
participate in FRESH is noteworthy. Fathers have an
independent influence on their children ’s health and devel-
opment [ 59] and an important influence on children ’s
physical activity [ 60–62], but they are grossly underrepre-
sented in family-based interventions [ 63]. Fathers ’engage-
ment with FRESH is consistent with recent evidence that
fathers are more willing to participate in family-based in-
t e r v e n t i o n sw h e nt h ef o c u si so nt h e i rc h i l d r e n[ 64]a n d ,a s
a result, reported newfound enjoyment for family-based
physical activity and a desire to be a positive role model
[65]. The online delivery of FRESH may have also appealed
some fathers [ 64].
Optimising measurement
The duration of data collection at both time points was
in line with our estimates and acceptability of the dur-
ation, and number of measures was high for both adults
and children. Nevertheless, it may have acted as a barrier
to participation. Minor adjustments are needed to im-
prove the quality of the expenditure and familyGuagliano et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:21 Page 12 of 15
functioning data and monitor wear time. For example, a
greater emphasis on recruiting whole families, removal
of the written aspect of the activity, and shifting the
order of measures, so that the Fictional Family Holiday
activity occurs earlier during data collection, might im-
prove the quality of the family functioning data. To im-
prove wear time, emphasis should be placed that each
individual participant should wear the monitors for as
long as possible from the time they wake up until the
time they go to sleep as opposed to children ’s bedtime.
Also, reminders (e.g. e-mail, phone) could improve wear
time [ 66], particularly at the end of the week to improve
weekend wear.
Strengths and limitations
This study is among the first physical activity interven-
tions that aimed to target and measure whole families,
providing novel evidence in an area where more primary
research is needed [ 18]. The phased approach of asses-
sing feasibility and acceptability to inform refinement for
pilot study is in accordance with established guidelines
[67]. Public involvement was used extensively to inform
development and refinement of FRESH, as suggested pre-
viously [ 68,69]. Further, our use of a mixed-methods
design provides unique insight and context for our quanti-
tative findings, assisting in identifying strategies to further
optimise FRESH. Limitations include that we were unable
to fully employ our recruitment strategy and did not have
the opportunity to test the efficacy of recruiting families
through community-based recruitment. Additionally, only
one-third of families enrolled in FRESH included all family
members.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study demonstrates feasibility and ac-
ceptability of the family-targ eted FRESH intervention and
provides valuable suggestions for further optimisation. This
work informs a future pilot trial testing the impact of these
adaptations and the preliminary effectiveness of FRESH on
family physical activity. The findings of our upcoming pilot
trial will inform sample size/power calculations for a future
definitive trial, should the pilot study findings suggest a
definitive trial is warranted.
