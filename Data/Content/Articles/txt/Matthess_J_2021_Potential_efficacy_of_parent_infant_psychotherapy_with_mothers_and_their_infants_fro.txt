Abstract 
Background: Psychotherapy of mother ‑child dyads is an intervention which was developed to prevent maltreat ‑
ment and negative children’s development. There is a lack of good‑ quality research investigating psychotherapeutic 
interventions and social care for mothers at high‑risk living in Mother ‑Child Facilities in Germany. The present rand‑
omized controlled pilot trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the need for parent ‑infant psychotherapy (PIP) and to explore its 
impact on the mother ‑infant relationship. Primary feasibility objectives were recruitment and attrition, with potential 
efficacy defined as the secondary feasibility objective.
Methods: This pilot RCT focused on (young) mothers with cumulative risk factors and their infants under 7 months 
of age living in Mother ‑Child Facilities. N=32 mother ‑child dyads were randomly allocated to PIP or Care as usual 
(CAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months of intervention. The primary potential efficacy 
outcome was maternal sensitivity. Secondary outcomes were maternal mental health problems, reflective function‑
ing, parenting stress, personality organization, infant’s development, and attachment.
Results: At baseline, all mothers showed low levels of emotional availability, but results revealed improvements 
in sensitivity, mental health problems, stress, and depressive symptomatology favoring PIP after 6 months. Positive 
developments in maternal sensitivity, a healthy aspect of mother ‑child interaction, were only found in the PIP group. 
Overall attrition was high at 6 months. Some evidence of fewer depressive symptoms and lower maternal distress 
after 6 months of PIP ‑intervention exists that did not reach significance.
Conclusion: Findings revealed improvements in the mother’s well‑being for both groups, but PIP had a higher 
impact on the mother ‑child dyad. In sum, there is some evidence that PIP may represent an effective intervention 
offer besides the social and pedagogical support in these facilities, but further research is demanded.
Trial registration: DRKS0 00224 85 (retrospectively registered).

Key messages regarding feasibility
• What areas of uncertainty regarding feasibility 
existed prior to this study?
There were uncertainties regarding the barriers to par -
ticipant recruitment and retention in mothers and their 
children living in Mother-Child Facilities. Further, there 
was a lack of high-quality research in this area so that 
there was a need for piloting to identify potential strate -
gies for improving recruitment and retention and to test 
the research methods.
• What are the key feasibility findings?
Key feasibility findings were a lack of motivation and 
interest to participate in the study. In addition, most of 
the participating mothers were concerned about study 
goals and reported discomfort about psychotherapeutic 
interventions, as well as negative experiences with the 
healthcare system. There were not enough incentives 
for remaining in the study or taking part in it in the first 
place.
• What are the implications of the feasibility findings 
for the design of the main study?
The implications for the design of the larger RCT are 
to consider problems with recruitment and retention. 
For this purpose, strategies for improving time sched -
uling like fitting into daily routine of the mother-child 
dyads and verbal reminders may be beneficial. Emphasis 
should be given on the motivational side of participation 
by providing more information on the positive effects 
such interventions potentially have for the mothers and 
their children. Retention might be further increased by 
the availability of home visits in case a mother-child dyad 
leaves the facility. Future studies need also to consider 
a potential effect of social and pedagogical care which 
should be addressed in power analyses and sample size 
calculation. Before conducting a RCT qualitative studies 
would be beneficial as well.
Introduction
Maternal risk factors like early motherhood, mental 
health problems, or trauma can lead to a lack of mater -
nal sensitivity and reflective functioning up to a situation 
where mothers are unable to support the child suffi -
ciently in coping with early developmental and maturing 
issues. In high-risk populations, the cumulation of these 
factors bears a higher possibility of child’s adverse devel -
opment and maltreatment. In contrast, a stable parent-
child relationship is seen as an essential resilience factor for a healthy mental, physical, and secure attachment 
development of the child [1–5]. The present feasibility 
study examines the potential efficacy of a dyadic parent-
infant psychotherapy (PIP) with (young) mothers at risk 
and their children with an age up to 7 months living in 
Mother-Child Facilities.
Early motherhood is seen as a risk for the development 
and well-being of the child. Especially adolescent mothers 
aged between 15 and 21 are considered of being at higher 
risk for adverse developments [1, 6]. In the transition 
from adolescence to adulthood, giving birth increases 
the exposure of child maltreatment, neglect, and adverse 
child development as well as the risk of maternal mental 
health problems [7–10]. Particularly young mothers suf -
fer from depressive mood and future anxiety which may 
interfere with sensitive and emotionally available parent -
ing. The cumulation of further risk factors like absence 
of partner, poverty, own history of childhood trauma, 
and high level of psychological stress makes these moth -
ers vulnerable for impaired maternal functioning in the 
postpartum period and may influence sensitivity towards 
the infant [6, 8, 10, 11]. (Young) mothers with cumulative 
risk factors are therefore subsumed as a population at 
high-risk and are likely to be under the persistent super -
vision of the German youth welfare. According to recent 
reviews, maternal mental health problems, stress, and 
maltreatment can lead to externalizing and internalizing 
behavior problems in the child with an increasing risk for 
transmission of these malignant patterns [11, 12].
Predominantly adolescent and young mothers show 
less sensitive and more intrusive behavior towards their 
infants [6, 7, 11, 13, 14]. Studies have shown that in the 
interaction with the child young mothers in compari -
son to adult mothers tend to over- and understimulation 
with less structuring behavior and more misinterpreta -
tions of the infant’s signals [6]. This causes several nega -
tive developmental effects for the child like behaving in 
an insecure, passive, or even fearful manner and can lead 
to behavior problems [15] and social-emotional and cog -
nitive impairments [11, 16]. Nevertheless, children of 
adult mothers suffering from postpartal mental health 
problems show a similar vulnerability for adverse devel -
opment with an increasing risk of insecure attachment 
development and of clinical emotional and behavioral 
problems [16–19]. With prevalence rates of up to 21% 
for postpartal depression, anxiety and obsessive-compul -
sive disorders and a high comorbidity of these, maternal 
mental health problems can affect the relationship to the 
child and impedes the establishment of a secure attach -
ment development [20–22]. In contrast, children with 
an emotional available and sensitive caregiver are shown 
to develop an organized attachment and socioemotional 
regulation throughout childhood.

Even before these women at high-risk become preg -
nant, most of them fail to have a regular daily routine 
and have problems coping with everyday life and given 
up schooling or working [7, 23]. The child is therefore 
also at higher risk for maltreatment, neglect, or abuse. To 
ensure a healthy development for the mother-child dyad, 
mothers with cumulative risk factors receive support in 
Mother-Child Facilities by the German youth welfare as 
defined in the German Social Security Code (SGB VIII 
§19). Mother-Child Facilities offer preventive pedagogi -
cal and social support to mothers, fathers, and children 
aged up to 6 years. Parents in these facilities often dis -
play various disadvantages such as mental health prob -
lems, very early motherhood, or experienced trauma. In 
such Mother-Child Facilities live around 8–10 mother-
child dyads permanently. They are offered 24/7 social 
and pedagogical care, being supported in raising and 
establishing a positive relationship with their child. To 
facilitate a positive dyadic development, this kind of pre -
ventive social support is considered a positive factor for 
future child development and its life-course trajectories. 
It can also support mothers coping with their everyday 
life and occurring feelings of overstraining. The aim of 
Mother-Child Facilities is to strengthen parenting skills 
and competences, parent-child attachment, to clarify the 
common perspective and, if necessary, to separate parent 
and child [24].
Although most of the mothers living in such facilities 
are adolescent or young, some of them are also adults. 
These mothers are not always positive about living in 
Mother-Child Facilities. Although there is often an obvi -
ous need for psychotherapeutic support, many of these 
institutions do not provide any psychotherapeutic sup -
port. With its dyadic approach, parent-infant psychother -
apy (PIP) aims to improve the mother-child relationship, 
the infant’s attachment, and the maternal sensitivity 
[17, 25–27]. The available evidence indicates that PIP is 
more effective in subgroups of at-risk populations and 
specifically for mothers experiencing social adversity or 
problems [19, 28–30]. Nevertheless, none of these stud -
ies have targeted the special risk group of mothers living 
in Mother-Child Facilities with persistent supervision of 
the youth welfare. In comparison to other interventions 
such as parenting programs, family support, and medica -
tion [2, 31, 32], PIP shows high effect sizes on attachment 
development (see [33, 34]). In contrast, intervention pro -
grams, promoting positive parenting for young parents, 
show up mixed results [1]. Bartlett and Easterbrooks 
[35] discuss a moderating effect of young motherhood 
for the child’s outcome and reveal that the transmission 
of neglect is attenuated by mothers experiencing social 
support. Still, the meta-analysis by Taubner et  al. [32] 
pointed to the fact that many of the early intervention programs are too low in frequency to cover the need for 
social and therapeutic support and to address the signifi -
cant risk of child welfare vulnerability in these families. 
Although prevention programs were more effective in 
high-risk groups, they show generally smaller effects than 
psychotherapeutic interventions.
Up till now, many intervention programs in Germany 
have been developed, mainly without any scientific evalu -
ation [32]. Especially when it comes to Mother-Child 
Facilities, there is a lack of systematic empirical research 
[36, 37]. For limiting the influences of negative impair -
ments on the child, research about the effectiveness of 
such social and pedagogical care and the effectiveness 
of PIP in this high-risk population is needed. Given the 
impact of cumulative risk factors in early motherhood 
and of maternal mental health problems, stress, and 
trauma on the development of the child, it is impor -
tant to prevent malignant trajectories of these high-risk 
mothers and to strengthen the positive development of 
their children. Besides the pedagogical and social care, 
there could be a need for therapeutic interventions like 
PIP that focus explicitly on the mother-child dyad with 
mental health problems. The aim of this randomized 
controlled pilot trial was to evaluate the need and the 
potential efficacy of PIP for mothers at risk and their chil -
dren living in Mother-Child Facilities. Primary feasibil -
ity objectives were recruitment and attrition, while the 
evaluation of potential efficacy was the main secondary 
feasibility objective.
Method
Design
The study was designed as a monocentric, two-arm, 
open, randomized controlled pilot trial with parallel 
groups and 6-month intervention. To minimize selec -
tion bias, allocation concealment was set before first 
data collection. Data were collected at three measure -
ment points: first at the beginning of the intervention 
(T1), after 3 months (T2), and at the end of the 6-month 
intervention (T3). This pilot RCT aimed to explore the 
potential efficacy of PIP (in addition to care as usual) for 
mothers with cumulative risk factors and their infants 
up to an age of 7 months from a high-risk population in 
comparison to care as usual. The study was conducted 
in Mother-Child Facilities in Berlin, Germany, in which 
the participants live and receive 24/7 care. The primary 
outcome of the pilot RCT was maternal sensitivity meas -
ured by videotaped dyadic play interactions. Secondary 
outcomes were maternal mental health problems, reflec -
tive functioning, personality development, and maternal 
stress, as well as infant’s development and infant’s attach -
ment. It was hypothesized that in comparison to care as

usual only, PIP increases maternal sensitivity and infant’s 
attachment.
Participants
A total of 32 mother-infant dyads were included in the 
study and were randomly allocated to the PIP group 
(n=16, age: MD=21.5 years, SD=4.07) or the CAU con -
trol group (n = 16; age: MD=22.1 years, SD=6.09). At 
time of recruitment the dyads already lived for 1 to 7 
months in the facilities, the average age of these moth -
ers was M=21.82 years (SD=5.04) and their infants were 
on average MD=3.6 months old (SD=2.23). About half of 
the participants were adolescent mothers under 21 years 
of age (see Table 1).
Participants were included if they lived in Mother-
Child Facilities in Germany, were under permanent 
supervision by the youth welfare, and were exposed at 
psychosocial risk such as unemployment (78.1%), single 
mother status (59.4%), adolescent mothers (50.0%), and 
mental health problems (59.4%) (see Table  1). Partici -
pants had to speak German at a sufficient level and the 
infant’s age had to be 7 months or younger. Mothers with 
an acute psychosis, suicidal tendencies, or substance abuse were excluded from study participation. For par -
ticipating, they received monetary compensation (30 €).
Procedure
After enrollment, informed consent to participate, and 
randomization, data were collected before (T1), at 3 
months (T2), and 6 months (T3) of intervention. Enroll -
ment and data acquisition were conducted by inde -
pendent researchers  staff members responsible for data 
collection were blind for treatment allocation. The rand -
omization list with a 1:1 block allocation to PIP or CAU 
was computed by an independent statistician (L.K.) who 
was not involved in preparation or execution of the trial 
before the start of the study. Randomization list was com -
puted with R statistical software using a personal com -
puter and the blockrand function (v1.1). Allocation was 
concealed for study personnel, but participants were not 
blind for treatment allocation. There were no special cri -
teria for discontinuing or modifying the allocated inter -
vention. All participants received care as usual with its 
social and pedagogical care, but the PIP group received 
in addition PIP intervention once weekly over a period 
of 6 months. In total, they had 20 PIP sessions with each 
session lasting approximately 50 min. All PIP therapists 
were trained psychotherapists and certified in the PIP 
method [25] and received at least quarterly supervisions.
After enrollment, the mothers were interviewed 
(M.I.N.I) [38] and asked to complete questionnaires at 
baseline and at 3 and 6 months (for details, see Measures 
below). At every measurement point, 10-min videos of 
mother-infant free-play interactions were recorded to 
subsequently code maternal sensitivity by the Emotional 
Availability Scale (EAS) [16]. The Strange Situation Pro -
cedure (SSP) [39] and the infant’s development (ET-6-6 
R) [40] were measured once at 6 months.
Parent‑infant psychotherapy and care‑as‑usual
Parent-infant psychotherapy is a psychotherapeutic inter -
vention in which mother-child dyads are treated together. 
Individual sessions could also be held together with the 
father or social worker/custodian. PIP aims at fostering 
the parent-infant relationship by supporting the parents’ 
ability to understand and mentalize the child’s affec -
tive states and by promoting parental self-reflection and 
sensitivity to support the parent-infant relationship. PIP 
targets the parent-infant relationship by observing their 
interaction and identifying their problems. It mainly 
focuses on improving the parenting behaviors by work -
ing on their internal working models aiming to promote 
optimal infant development and attachment security. 
As a mentalization-based psychodynamic approach, 
PIP works with reframing, an appropriate confrontation Table 1 Sociodemographic data of the study sample (N=32)

within a supportive framework, psychoeducation, the 
development of action strategies, and video-feedback.
Care-as-usual  represents the standard social and ped -
agogical care in the Mother-Child Facilities as provided 
by the German health system. CAU in these facilities dif -
fers in its offers from one another and is heterogeneous. 
It mainly consists of socio-pedagogical and educational 
care such as housekeeping, guided play lessons, discus -
sion groups, and the integration of fathers or partners. 
The CAU group does not receive any psychotherapeutic 
intervention but after a waiting period of 6 months, psy -
choeducational care was additionally offered to all CAU 
group participants.
Feasibility objectives
Recruitment rate of the planned N=40 dyads was meas -
ured as rates of consent, and completion rates of self-
report surveys evaluated to approximate attrition. A 
drop-out rate of 20% was expected (see [19]); thus, suc -
cess of feasibility would be determined if N=32 dyads 
remained in the study until T3. Secondary feasibility 
objectives were the primary and secondary outcomes of 
the pilot RCT to provide effect size measures, and sample 
size was to be used for future power analysis to design a 
large-scale RCT.
Measures
A sociodemographic questionnaire was administered to 
gather information such as maternal and child’s age, child 
gender, country of origin, status of employment, and 
relationship status. Further questionnaires were used to 
assess risk factors like maternal mental health problems, 
stress, personality development, and infant’s develop -
ment as well as attachment. All questionnaires were pro -
vided in German language.
Emotional Availability Scale (EAS)
Maternal sensitivity as primary endpoint was measured 
at all three measurement points using the Subscale Sen -
sitivity of the EAS [16]. The 10-min free-play interaction 
were conducted in the Mother-Child Facilities. EAS were 
coded by an independent and reliable rater, blinded for 
treatment allocation. The rater used a Likert Scale (1 to 
7; with 1–3= at risk, 3.5–4.5= some risk, and 5–7= non 
risk) to score maternal sensitivity as well as three further 
maternal EAS dimensions (structuring, nonintrusive -
ness and nonhostility) and two child EAS dimensions 
(responsiveness to parent and involvement with parent) 
to describe the mother-child interaction.
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I)
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 
(M.I.N.I.) [38] is a structured diagnostic interview which assesses 20 psychiatric disorders by DSM IV and ICD-10 
diagnosis. The interview was coded dichotomous (mani -
festation of mental health problem or not) and adminis -
tered by trained interviewers at T1 and T3.
Parenting Stress Index (PSI)
The German version of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) 
[41, 42] is a 48-item questionnaire that was assessed at all 
three measurement time points. With its 12 subscales, it 
comprises characteristics of stress in parents and in child. 
The questionnaire was assessed at all 3 measure times.
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [43] 
is a standard 10-item screening instrument measuring 
symptoms of maternal postpartum depression. It yields 
a total score. Scores between 10 and 12 indicate a pos -
sible postpartum depression and a score of 13 or higher 
indicates a fairly high likelihood of postpartum depres -
sive symptomatology. The questionnaire was assessed at 
T1 and T3.
Symptom Checklist (SCL‑K‑9)
The short version of the Symptom Checklist (SCL-K-
9) [44] is a 9-item screening questionnaire based on the 
original SCL-90-R [45]. The SCL-K-9 measures global 
mental health symptom severity in psychotherapy repre -
senting all 9 scales of the long version but does not dif -
ferentiate between individual types of symptoms. The 
questionnaire was assessed at T1 and T3.
Parental Reflective Questionnaire (PRFQ‑1)
The Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire 
(PRFQ-1) [46] is a validated questionnaire which meas -
ures the mother’s ability to mentalize in context of the 
relationship to her child. The PRFQ has 3 subscales, 
“Certainty about Mental States” (CM), “Pre-Mentalizing” 
(PM), and “Interest and Curiosity” (IC). The CM scale 
describes the opacity of mental states and ranges from a 
tendency of parents to be overly certain about the mental 
states of their child, to hypermentalizing or to hypomen -
talizing [46]. The PM scale describes a nonmentalizing 
state of mind with an inability of the parent to enter the 
subjective world of the child. High scores on PM often 
describe malevolent attributions of the child. The IC 
scale is a key factor of parental reflective functioning. IC 
captures the interest to think about the reasons of the 
child’s behavior. Low scores reflect an absence of interest 
and high scores reflect intrusive hypermentalizing [46]. 
The questionnaire was assessed at all 3 measure times.

Inventory of Personality Organization (IPO‑16)
The Inventory of Personality Organization (IPO-16) 
[44] is a 16-item screening instrument measuring the 
severity of personality dysfunction. The questionnaire 
is standardized, and validated, and was conducted at T1 
and T3. The IPO-16 yields a total score with a cut-off  
score > 2.38 assuming the likelihood of a severe struc -
tural deficit [44].
Parental Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ)
The Parental Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) [47] is a 
25-item screening instrument measuring the quality 
of parent-infant relationship. A total score ≥  26 is sug -
gested to indicate some type of bonding disorder and 
total scores ≥  40 to indicate severe bonding disorders 
or maternal rejection [48].
ET‑6‑6‑R developmental test
The developmental status is assessed by the German 
developmental test ET6-6-R [40]. The ET-6-6-R is a 
standardized test for children aged 6 months to 6 years 
that measures the developmental status of the child. 
The ET-6-6-R has 6 dimensions measuring body motor 
activity, motor activity, cognition, language skills , and 
socioemotional development. The test was measured at 
T3 and T scores were analyzed.
Strange Situation Procedure
The child’s attachment was assessed by the Strange 
Situation Procedure (SSP) [39] at T3. The SSP is a 
standardized procedure of eight episodes to record the 
quality of child’s attachment. The aim of the SSP is to 
activate the child’s attachment system. The test was 
recorded on video and coded by a certified and inde -
pendent rater. It subsequently assigned the children to 
three organized attachment styles (secure (B), insecure-
avoidant (A), insecure-resistant (C)) and one disorgan -
ized (D) attachment behavior.
Sample size
A sample size of N=40 was planned for this pilot RCT 
to be recruited within a period of 24 months. Such a 
sample size would allow to detect moderate effects of 
d = .45 with a power of 80% in an ANCOVA design. 
Recruitment stopped after 30 months with n  = 32 
mother-infant dyads being included at this time.
Data analyses
All analyses were conducted in the R (v3.6.1) environ -
ment for statistical computing using RStudio (v1.0.136). 
Data were stored under pseudonyms till the end of the 
study and were unblinded for treatment intervention after the last participant has completed the study. 
Only pseudonymous data sets were analyzed. For the 
main analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes, 
ANCOVAs were computed with the outcome meas -
ured at T3 as the dependent variable and group (PIP vs. 
CAU) as the between subjects factor and baseline (T1) 
measurements as the covariate [49]. A significant effect 
of group or a significant group*covariate interaction in 
these analyses indicates group differences at T3 after 6 
months of intervention while controlling for between 
subject differences at the baseline measurement.
Due to the large amount of missing data at T3 (only 
13 from 32 datasets are available), this procedure likely 
underestimates the true effects. Therefore intent-to-treat 
analyses were computed for continuous primary and 
secondary outcomes using linear mixed effects mod -
els (LMMs) for repeated measurements with restricted 
maximum-likelihood (REML) estimation. LMMs have 
the advantage of incorporating all available data and 
thus being less susceptible by missing data, leading to 
more precise parameter estimates in case of missing data 
compared to traditional analyses [50]. With regard to 
the present examinations, a further advantage lies in the 
fact that all three measurement time-points (if available) 
could be incorporated in these models at the same time. 
Thus, these LMMs included fixed effects of time (T1, T2, 
T3), group (PIP vs CAU), and the time*group interaction 
and subject-specific random intercepts. LMMs allow for 
model comparisons to evaluate model fit and the appro -
priateness of the model terms. Based on model compari -
sons using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and 
likelihood-ratio tests, it was found that for none of the 
outcome measures the inclusion of the group predictor 
was justified by the data. Therefore, all intent-to-treat 
analyses are based on simpler models that only included 
time as the single fixed effect and subject-specific random 
intercepts. A significant main effect of time thus indicates 
parallel developments in both intervention groups across 
the measurement time-points. Due to an ongoing discus -
sion on the computation of degrees of freedom in LMMs 
[51], significance was evaluated based on the computa -
tion of 95% confidence intervals around the parameter 
estimates (see Table  3). Please note again that sample size 
is small. The results of this pilot RCT are preliminary and 
should therefore be interpreted with caution. The focus 
should remain on the descriptive data and the 95% confi -
dence intervals.
Regarding the categorical primary outcome of attach -

Results
Feasibility
Motivation to participate and interest in the study were 
low and retention mostly sustained to ongoing contact 
and additional in-house support provided by the peda -
gogical stuff in the facilities. Due to ongoing child-care 
procedures, mothers were often concerned about par -
ticipating in the study. There were not enough incentives 
for remaining in the study or taking part in it in the first 
place. Eighteen of the 32 dyads (56.3%) dropped out dur -
ing the course of the study because of emergency removal 
of the child (n=4), they left the facility (n=3), the study 
(n=5), or because of other reasons (n=6) (see Fig.  1). 
Two of them were excluded from statistical analysis due 
to acute psychosis (n=1) and drop out before first data 
collection (n=1). There were no significant differences between the dyads which were lost at the 3-month and 
6-month assessments in terms of group differences, age, 
maternal education and employment, marital status, or 
stress index. This low interest gets also visible by the low 
numbers of filled out surveys at T3 (see Table  2). None of 
the self-report surveys were fully filled out or tests con -
ducted by all of the n = 14 dyads who remained in the 
study at T3, leading to as low numbers as n = 11 for the 
SSP analysis or the EAS video recordings. With such a 
high drop-out rate, feasibility regarding the attrition cri -
terion of 20% could not be successfully determined.
Emotional availability
One participant refused to record videos of her interac -
tions with the child, so only n=31 datasets were available 
for EAS analyses. Overall, it was found that all partici -
pants had relatively low scores in the EA-Scales at T1 
(sensitivity (M = 2.59, SD = 0.62), structuring (M = 2.59,

SD = 0.60), nonintrusiveness (M = 3.00, SD = 0.63), non -
hostility (M = 3.41, SD = 0.56), child-responsiveness (M 
= 2.67, SD = 0.63), and child-involvement (M = 2.20, SD 
= 0.56)) (see Table 2).
The primary outcome sensitivity of the EA-Scales 
the ANCOVA revealed no effect of group at T3 [F(1, 7) = 2.69; p = .145;  eta2 = .114], but a significant 
group*covariate interaction [F(1, 7) = 6.38; p = .039;  eta2 
= .271] (see Table  2). This effect is due to higher mater -
nal sensitivity at T3 in the PIP group compared to the 
CAU group moderated by the individual sensitivity score 
at T1. It seems to indicate a strong relationship between Table 2 Results of the ANCOVAs for all outcome measures with T3 measurement at 6 months as dependent variable and group (PIP 
vs. CAU) as the between subjects factor and T1 baseline measurement as covariate

T1 and T3 measures in the PIP group only (see Fig.  2). 
No effect of time was found in the mixed effects model 
with all three measurement time-points (both t’s < 1; see 
Table  3). Thus, PIP intervention had a small moderating 
effect on EAS sensitivity. No effects incorporating group 
in the ANCOVA and similar null effects regarding the 
development across time were obtained for the other EA-
Scales (maternal structuring, nonintrusiveness, nonhos -
tility, child’s responsiveness to parent; see Fig.  6), except 
for “involvement of parent” which increased from T1 to 
T3 (parameter estimate .34; 95% CI [.01; .66]; see Fig. 3).
Infant attachment behavior
Results of the child’s primary outcome attachment 
behavior as measured by SSP classifications after the intervention at 6 months were available from only n=11 
dyads (PIP n=4, CAU n=7). In the PIP group, n=1 child’s 
attachment behavior was classified as secure (B), n=1 as 
insecure-avoidant (A), and n=2 as insecure-resistant (C). 
In the CAU group, n=2 children’s attachment behavior 
was classified as secure (B), n=1 as insecure-avoidant (A), 
n=2 as insecure-resistant (C), and n=2 as disorganized 
(D). Although there were proportionally more infants in 
the CAU group who were classified as disorganized, the 
SSP four-way classifications were not significantly differ -
ent between groups (p = .857, see Table 3).
Maternal reflective functioning
No group differences were obtained for the self-reported 
reflective functioning measured by the PRFQ-1 subscales 
(all p-values >.290, see Table  2). Intention-to-treat anal -
yses incorporating all three time-points revealed that 
the subscale “Interest and Curiosity” (IC) significantly 
decreased from T1 to T2 (parameter estimate −2.68; 95% 
CI [−4.99; −.32]) and similarly from T1 to T3 (parameter 
estimate −3.36, 95% CI [−6.05; −.65], see Table  2 and 
Fig.  6). No such significant effects were found for “Pre-
Mentalizing” (PM) and “Certainty about Mental States” 
(CM) subscales.Table 3 Association between infant’s attachment (SSP) and

Maternal mental health
Overall number of mental health problems is high in 
the study sample. Twenty-one out of 32 mothers receive 
at least one diagnosis according to the M.I.N.I. at base -
line (PIP n=9; CAU n=12). Mental health measured at 
T3 differed between both groups, with CAU participants 
exhibiting a significantly higher number of mental health 
problems on average compared to PIP participants [F(1, 
9) = 7.60; p = .022;  eta2 = .096] accompanied by a sig -
nificant group*covariate interaction [F(1, 9) = 12.68; p 
= .006;  eta2 = .160]. While this effect of group did not 
remain significant in the subsequent intention-to-treat 
LMM analysis, a significant development across time 
from T1 to T3 was found, with a decreasing average 
number of mental health problems independent of inter -
vention group (parameter estimate −1.13, 95% CI [−1.95; 
−.32] (see Fig. 6 and Table 4).
In comparison, the number of SCL-K-9 symptoms was 
higher at T3 for CAU compared to PIP  (MPIP = 15.2, 
 MCAU   = 19.5) but this effect did not reach significance 
[F(1, 9) = 2.19; p = .173;  eta2 = .143], and there was no 
development across time (see Table 2).
Regarding postpartum depression scores, at T3 descrip -
tive differences were found with higher scores in the 
CAU group  (MCAU   = 5.7) compared to PIP group  (MPIP 
= 1.8), a difference that again did not reach significance 
[F(1, 8) = 2.57; p = .147;  eta2 = .239]. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that independent of group membership 
the scores significantly decreased between T1 and T3 
(parameter estimate −6.01, 95% CI [−9.77; −2.25], see 
Table 2 and Fig. 4).
Maternal stress
While sum scores of maternal stress reveal no difference 
between both intervention groups at T3 [F(1, 8) = 2.92; 
p = .126;  eta2 = .190], the maternal distress subscale was 
higher at T3 in CAU group  (MCAU   = 75.7) compared to 
PIP group  (MPIP = 60.2), an effect that approached signif -
icance in the ANCOVA [F(1, 8) = 4.34; p = .063;  eta2 = 
.192]. No such group effect was found in the distress with 
the child subscale [F(1,8) = .90; p = .370;  eta2 = .100] 
(see Table  2). In the LMM analysis, independent of group 
a development for the maternal distress subscale was 
revealed for the T2-T1 comparison (parameter estimate 
−6.60, 95% CI [−12.11; −1.22]) with an overall reduction 
of maternal distress compared to baseline assessment 
(see Fig.  6). No such effects were obtained for the sum 
score or the distress with the child subscale or the T3-T1 
comparison (see Table 4).
Personality organization
The evaluation of the severity of personality dysfunction 
assessed by the self-report IPO-16 inventory revealed no 
significant effects (see Table 2).

Maternal bonding
Descriptively, the maternal bonding as assessed by the 
PBQ at 6 months is at a level that indicates a bond -
ing disorder in most participants (M =  44.5, range 33 
to 49) with 9 out of 11 mothers receiving scores above 
the upper cut-off of a total score of 40. Of interest is 
that at baseline much lower scores are found: 20 out of 
32 mothers scored below 22 (see Fig.  5). This effect of 
time gets significant in the LMM analysis: independent 
of group the total scores increase from baseline assess -
ment to 6-month follow-up (parameter estimate 22.27, 
95% CI [12.57; 31.98]) which indicates a decline in the 
self-reported quality of the mother-infant relationship 
across time. No significant effects involving group were 
revealed in the ANCOVA (see Table 2 ).
Child development
At T3 only data from 13 children were available (PIP 
n=5; CAU n =8). Descriptively, across all five sub -
scales, only children in the CAU group were classified 
as having a “serious deficit in development” (in 3 out of 
5 classifications). Still, the group comparison revealed 
no significant group differences (all p -values > .216, see 
Table 2 ).Discussion
The randomized pilot trial examined feasibility of 
recruitment and potential efficacy of PIP as an additional 
offer besides the social and pedagogical care in Ger -
man Mother-Child Facilities, with a particular focus on 
maternal sensitivity and child attachment in a high-risk 
population. It was found that PIP had small but consist -
ent effects on maternal sensitivity but no effects on chil -
dren’s attachment behaviour. The results also reveal that 
maternal mental health, stress, and reflective function -
ing decreased, with some evidence of group differences. 
However, overall low sample size after attrition lowers 
the generalizability and interpretations of the present 
results.
Mothers in the PIP group at 6 months reported a lower 
number of mental health problems compared to CAU 
participants. Independent of group all mothers had a 
lower number of mental health diagnoses after 6 months 
of living in Mother-Child Facilities. In the same direction 
and with large effect sizes (but not significant), mothers 
in the PIP group had fewer depressive symptoms and 
lower distress and showed increased sensitivity towards 
the child after 6 months of intervention. The effect in the 
primary outcome maternal sensitivity was only found as 
a significant interaction: In CAU participants, sensitivity

at baseline has no relationship with post-intervention 
sensitivity scores, while in the PIP group mothers with 
higher baseline levels benefitted most from PIP interven -
tion. According to the meta-analysis of Barlow et al. [33], 
PIP is more effective in high-risk populations, and the 
present data in sum fit into this notion. It is still puzzling, 
why mothers with already higher baseline levels benefited 
more. It could be hypothesized that higher sensitivity 
levels at the beginning and thus a better understanding 
of the child’s needs and signals are an eligible ramp for 
further improvement, but additional experimental data is 
needed, due to the overall small sample size and the high 
attrition rates at T3.
At baseline, all of the examined mothers show relatively 
low levels of emotional availability, particularly regard -
ing maternal sensitivity. Sensitivity is discussed as one of 
the key factors for the child’s healthy development. The 
present results reveal that these mothers at high-risk pre -
dominantly show difficulties in reading the emotional 
signals of their infants and their infants tend to show a 
poorer development. Whereas limited maternal emo -
tional availability is seen a predictor of insecure attach -
ment [17], one might hypothesize that a lack of sensitivity 
in adulthood is related to an immature ability to recog -
nize or process infant’s emotional states or impeding sen -
sitive parenting [52]. Studies have shown that especially 
younger mothers have problems in understanding the child’s needs adequately and tend to misunderstand the 
infant’s level of development, giving them an inappropri -
ate meaning or show more instrumental (and less affec -
tionate) behavior [6, 53]. Children in the present study 
tend to show more passive behavior with less involve -
ment and responsiveness in the interaction, which could 
be a consequence of maternal insensitivity and a factor 
for developmental delays. The overall low EA-Scores at 
baseline and 6 months indicate an increased risk of trans -
missions of rearing experiences and malignant patterns 
to the offspring in the at high-risk study sample. All these 
findings can also ultimately lead to an insecure attach -
ment development [5, 6]. It could be hypothesized that 
these results may be due to the cumulative risk factors of 
having an own history of harsh life experiences, trauma, 
or missing positive parenting experiences, leading to 
maternal insensitivity in the interaction with the child [6, 
17].
As seen from EA-Scales and SSP , all participants were 
at high risk of disturbance in early mother and child inter -
action at baseline and, respectively, regarding attachment 
development at 6 months. The majority of the infants are 
insecurely attached to their mothers and thus could be 
expected to have more difficult developmental trajecto -
ries [4, 17]. These findings from a high-risk population 
are in contrast to the results of Barlow et al. [33] showing 
that parents who received PIP were more likely to have an

 Mattheß et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:210 
 
infant who was securely emotionally attached after inter -
vention. Due to the missing premeasurement of mater -
nal attachment, the present findings must be interpreted 
with caution, although, it is well known that maternal 
attachment style is related to the style they give to their 
own offspring [53]. Recent research has revealed a link 
between attachment classifications among mothers with 
a history of childhood abuse and neglect as well as inse -
cure and disorganized attachment classification [54, 55]. 
A similar difficult prognosis can be drawn from the post -
partum bonding results which indicate difficult to severe 
bonding deficits in all mothers at 6 months. Here, in con -
trast to maternal sensitivity, no differences between both 
groups were found. Thus, neither care in Mother-Child 
Facilities nor 6 months of PIP intervention had a positive 
effect on the maternal bonding—despite the effects on 
maternal sensitivity and reflective functioning. Overall, 
the PBQ results seem at odd with the literature. A defi -
cit in bonding cannot be predicted from previous studies 
which mainly agree in that social care and psychothera -
peutic intervention increase maternal bonding processes, 
i.e., positive feelings, and affection towards the child (e.g., 
[47]). Though case reports exist where bonding difficul -
ties last beyond the end of treated postpartum depression 
[56], also there are methodological problems associated 
with the use of PBQ in a high-risk sample. With very low scores at baseline, it seems similarly likely that mothers 
reported socially desired behavior. After 6 months of care 
and with improved reflective functioning and the capac -
ity to mentalize, a better description of their bonding can 
be found. Such tendencies should be addressed in future 
research and compared with further samples of mothers.
The present analyses reveal that mothers with higher 
levels of sensitivity benefit most from PIP in this high-
risk sample and are more likely to have a better relation -
ship to the child. Thus, there appears a clear impact on 
mother’s well-being. In support of this first evaluation, 
it was also found that interest and curiosity in the child’s 
behavior, a factor of parental reflective functioning, 
decreased in both intervention groups. This can be either 
a result of an improved understanding of the child and its 
signals [6] or due to the child’s increasing age and its abil -
ity to better communicate with the parent. Nevertheless, 
in comparison with the high (hypermentalizing) scores at 
baseline, a lower interest and curiosity score in the child’s 
mental state might be interpreted as a better ability to be 
less intrusive and to mentalize with regard to the child 
and in turn have a more responsive child. It has also to be 
noted that certainty about mental states and interest and 
curiosity still remain with striking high scores during the 
6 months, indicating an overall low ability for maternal 
reflective functioning and mentalizing in context of the

child [57]. The overall level of maternal reflective func -
tioning did not increase significantly over time and is 
still below the normal levels of reflective functioning and 
mentalizing (cf. [57]), replicating findings from high-risk 
groups of imprisoned mothers [58].
Parenting distress was reduced in the first 3 months, 
an effect that was not found at 6 months anymore. It 
seems that living in the Mother-Child Facilities initially 
lowers maternal stress levels in both groups. But with 
longer stay, one could hypothesize distress levels increase 
again. This might be related to the support received in 
these facilities and in the study, which initially leads to 
emotional well-being of the mother [59]. One might 
further hypothesize that the care provided in these spe -
cial homes and the influence of other peers initially has 
a positive impact on the mother’s emotional well-being. 
At first, living in the mother child homes with 24/7 care 
may improve maternal confidence and reduce feelings of 
isolation [27]. The support offered by the facilities might 
bring relief from acute problems in the first months. With 
longer stays, the everyday life becomes however increas -
ingly stressful; potential child welfare or child-care pro -
ceedings and the question of the dyad’s separation might 
interfere with maternal stress level. Also living together 
with similarly burdened (adolescent) mothers can be 
experienced as stressful. The multi-professional team, 
which was first seen as supportive, can change into a bur -
den task. However, these results have to be interpreted 
with caution, because the current study did not measure 
the subjective experiences of the participants.
These results also signal that all dyads in the sample 
were at an increasing risk for child maltreatment. The 
mixed model analyses reveal some evidence that living 
in Mother-Child Facilities, with its social and pedagogi -
cal care, improves maternal mental health symptoms 
and functioning. Findings that are in line with the meta-
analysis of Taubner et al. [32] who reveal that early inter -
vention programs (without therapeutic elements) lead to 
symptom reductions and can be regarded as true pro -
gram effects. It also has to be noted that the majority of 
the mothers show mental health problems without get -
ting adequate therapeutic support. Across measurement 
points, depressive symptomatology and the number of 
mental health problems decreased and involvement of 
the mother with the child increased. Thus, independ -
ent of intervention group, the risk to the child’s welfare 
was lowered. Again, the missing PIP versus CAU group 
effects seems at least partly be attributable to overall 
low sample size and high drop-out rates. Still, the results 
point to slight group differences at 6 months, in that only 
in the group with additional psychotherapeutic inter -
vention the distress level at 6 months period remains 
at a lower level. In line with the aims of PIP , one might assume that mothers in the PIP group are more sensitive 
with the child’s signals and thus start to interpret signals 
differently leading to lower levels of reported distress. 
With regard to child’s development, only the children in 
the CAU group were at higher developmental risk after 
6 months, but without a significant group difference. It 
seems likely that the decrease of maternal distress may 
provide a resilience factor for the infant’s development.
Given the small PIP effects, it has to be discussed why 
the results in sum did not mirror previous reported find -
ings and the initial hypotheses. It seems likely that mater -
nal painful and traumatic experiences may be limiting the 
capacity to reflect thoughts, feelings, and intentions of 
the child [59, 60] and undergo therapy outcome. Hence, 
this very difficult sample of predominantly young moth -
ers shows low motivation of being treated. While posi -
tive therapy outcome is associated with the participants 
motivation and the willing to change [28], poor therapy 
outcome is also related to personality organization and 
the structural level of mothers. Koelen et  al. [61] high -
light in a systematic review the personality organization 
as a predictive factor for success in therapy. According to 
this, low structural levels of personality organization can 
impede therapy outcomes, findings which seem related 
to the present findings. Nearly half of the participants 
show at baseline a personality organization that can be 
interpret as indicating a structural deficit. Hence, parents 
with difficult and ongoing mental health issues are hav -
ing the worst therapeutic outcome [62]. The uncertainty 
about what PIP entailed could be another reason for poor 
treatment outcome and high drop-out rates [63]. Ransley 
et al. [28] further highlighted that treatment expectations 
and the ability to speak about own concerns not to speak 
about past (traumatic) experiences in therapy sessions 
are, among others, key factors for enhancing parental 
reflective functioning in therapy.
Limitations
Although there is small but consistent evidence for the 
effectiveness of PIP , there are also limitations including 
high drop-out rates, the selection of questionnaires, and 
the follow-up period. It has to be noted that the results 
should be interpreted with caution as the heterogenous 
and small sample size could limit the generalizing of 
results. Small sample sizes are likely to have contrib -
uted to a lack of statistical power to detect significant 
effects. The current findings reveal several large effects 
(in terms of effect sizes  eta2 > .125) after 6 months that 
are reported as not significant. A lack of a long-term fol -
low-up and a larger sample size could have brought up 
more stable results, i.e., mothers’ improvements seen in 
the measures had not yet been consolidated enough to 
be internalized and reflected in the mother’s outcomes 
Page 15 of 18
 Mattheß et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:210 
 
and child’s secure attachment development. A long-term 
follow-up is required to understand the sustainability of 
treatment effects.
The high drop-out rates seem related to the high-risk 
population assessed. Many of these mothers are con -
cerned discussing their past (traumatic) experiences in 
therapy sessions. Treatment barriers are often one of the 
main explanations for early drop out [64]; hence, demog -
raphy and own expectations are discussed as having the 
biggest impact [28]. In line with previous studies [32], 
it was observed that this at-risk population had only lit -
tle therapeutic motivation or intention of being treated, 
although there is an obvious need for treatment. In many 
cases, the burdened mothers are unable to guarantee 
appointments and continuity [32]. The anecdotal qualita -
tive evidence reported by the study staff leads to a pic -
ture where it is more difficult for the researchers and the 
psychotherapists to establish a positive working relation -
ship to the mother. Thus, new models and methods to 
establish working alliances and a therapeutic relation -
ship should be incorporated in future adaptations of PIP 
for these at-risk populations, with a particular focus on 
the needs of these mothers and children. For example, 
PIP interventions could also be offered at home and with 
a flexible frequency. Grosse Holtforth et  al. [65] argued 
that frequency, regularity, and flexibility are key fac -
tors for the therapeutic relationship, factors which are 
difficult to establish for this risk sample. Most of these 
mothers never experienced stable relationships. Thus, a 
trustful working alliance needs more time and effort to 
be developed in these settings [63].
Further limitations include the recorded 10-min 
mother-child play interactions for EA coding which may 
be insufficient to capture the overall quality of mother-
infant relationship and may limit the external validity 
of the measure. Standard recommendations are 20-min 
intervals although meaningful results with shorter ses -
sions have also been reported [66]. The reliance on 
screening questionnaires like IPO-16 and SCL-K and 
the self-report measurements can also lead to distor -
tions and bias of results. Although the study focused on 
mother and child, more instruments should have been 
used to assess the development status and outcomes of 
the child. The child could be an important indicator for 
the mother-child relationship, but only the child’s devel -
opmental progress and attachment is assessed in the 
present study. Child symptomatology and mental health 
could be added in future research. On the other hand, in 
terms of feasibility one might wonder whether the num -
ber of self-report measures could have contributed to the 
high drop-out rates in the present study. Overall motiva -
tion to participate, interest, and understanding of empiri -
cal research was found to be low in the sample. Future studies should aim to further reduce the number of ques -
tionnaires in exchange for more external and objective 
evaluations by nurses and therapists. The results of the 
feasibility study partly contributed to the development of 
the RCT design of two large-scale PIP intervention stud -
ies [67, 68]. The missing psychiatric diagnoses of mothers 
as inclusion criteria likely also affect therapy outcome. 
Finally, it must be noted that there are many other risk 
factors which were not assessed in the present study, but 
which may contribute to disturbances in mother-child 
dyad in the Mother-Child Facilities. It is a combination 
of cumulative factors leading to the high risk of child 
welfare, abuse, and adverse mother-child development. 
Potential child-care proceedings, transition from ado -
lescence to adulthood, problems with peers, fathers, or 
social workers might interfere with treatment outcomes, 
enhancing the maternal stress level and interfere with a 
secure attachment establishment.
Nevertheless, improvements in the whole sample due 
to the care provided in these Mother-Child Facilities 
might lower the likelihood of finding effects in the PIP 
intervention group. More effort should be taken to evalu -
ate the effects of the social and pedagogical care in the 
Mother-Child Facilities with a particular focus on psy -
chological effects like parenting stress and reflective 
functioning and also mental health. Thus, besides the 
necessity of larger samples sizes, more or different con -
trol groups are demanded in future studies of these at-
risk samples.
Conclusion
This pilot study established a first randomized controlled 
trial with mother-infant dyads at high-risk living in Ger -
man Mother-Child Facilities, with a particular focus on 
the impact of additionally offered PIP on the mother-
infant-relationship. Due to the high drop-out rate, only 
preliminary conclusions can be made at this stage. Some 
evidence was found that all mothers benefit from the 
social and pedagogical support offered by the staff in 
these facilities. Group differences were small and are best 
documented for reduced mental health problems in the 
psychotherapy intervention group with some evidence of 
additional improvements in maternal sensitivity.
In order to prevent a transgenerational transmission of 
mental health problems and malignant attachment pat -
terns, it is necessary to continue the evaluation of such 
psychotherapeutic interventions that target psycho -
logically and socially burdened mothers (and fathers) 
of infants in Mother-Child Facilities. It is alarming, that 
most of the mothers assessed show mental health prob -
lems, and depressive symptomatology and have no psy -
chotherapeutic support offered. Considering the impact 
of maternal pathology on the child’s development, it is 
Page 16 of 18 Mattheß et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:210 
crucially important to establish further research with 
psychotherapeutic interventions.
Further research is needed to evaluate the effective -
ness and need of PIP in Mother-Child Facilities, but 
also to evaluate the effectiveness of the preventive and 
social care. The next step of this project is to design a 
larger RCT by thoroughly considering the problems 
with recruitment and retention. Before conducting a 
RCT qualitative studies would be beneficial. Emphasis 
should be given on the motivational side, for example by 
providing more information on the positive effects such 
interventions have for the participating dyads. Retention 
might be increased by the availability of home visits in 
case a mother-child dyad leaves the facility. Such a future 
study needs also to consider a potential effect of social 
and pedagogical care. The present results show, however, 
that maternal emotional availability can be improved, and 
both interventions support the at-risk mothers to gain a 
better understanding of their children and their needs. 
With its psychodynamic, mentalization-based approach, 
PIP seems to be an appropriate additional offer for these 
high-risk mothers. However, further research is needed 
to particularly evaluate the factors and procedural char -
acteristics of an effective intervention in such a group of 
mother-infant dyads living at-risk. It still remains unclear 
which change mechanisms underlie the effects of socio-
pedagogical support and to what extent they are ben -
eficial for this specific risk population or transferrable to 
other samples.
In sum, the findings support the notion that this first 
empirical evaluation of PIP in Mother-Child Facilities 
and with mothers at high-risk reveals a positive impact 
on the dyad. It clearly has to be noted that this high-risk 
sample is difficult to assess. From great clinical impor -
tance is the question of what works for whom and what 
enables (adolescent) mothers to engage (or not) in study 
flow and therapy. A further feasibility result seems to be 
the understanding that it might be more important to 
first fulfill basic needs such as shelter and safety, before 
embarking on a psychotherapeutic intervention. It seems 
likely that PIP is more effective once the environment had 
stabilized for the mother-child dyads—which should be 
addressed in future research. In order to capture this par -
ticular group of mothers and their children at high-risk 
properly, research is needed considering the participants’ 
subjective world as well as effects of psychotherapies and 
long-term consequences.
