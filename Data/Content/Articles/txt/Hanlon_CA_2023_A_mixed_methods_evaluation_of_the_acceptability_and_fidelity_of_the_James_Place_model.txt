ABSTRACT  
Background: Research supports development of informal, 
community-based suicide prevention interventions that can be 
tailored to suit men’s unmet needs. The James’ Place model (JPM) 
is a community-based, clinical suicide prevention intervention for 
men experiencing suicidal crisis. Evidence supports the efficacy of 
the JPM and there are plans to expand to additional sites across 
the UK. This study evaluates therapists perceived acceptability of 
the JPM, and if fidelity to the planned delivery of the model is 
maintained within therapeutic practice.
Method: A mixed-methods design was used. Descriptive analyses 
of 30 completed intervention cases were examined to review 
fidelity of the model against the intervention delivery plan. Eight 
therapists took part in semi-structured interviews between 
November 2021 and March 2022 exploring the perceived 
acceptability, and barriers and facilitators to delivering the JPM.
Results: Descriptive analyses of James’ Place audit notes revealed 
high levels of adherence to the JPM amongst therapists, but 
highlighted components of the model needed to be tailored 
according to individual men’s needs. Thematic analysis led to the 
development of five themes. The first theme, therapeutic 
environment highlighted importance of the therapy setting. The 
second theme identified was specialised suicide prevention training 
in the JPM that facilitated therapists understanding and expertise. 
The third theme identified was therapy engagement which 
discusses men’s engagement in therapy. The fourth theme, 
person-centred care related to adaptation of delivery of JPM 
components. The final theme, adapting the JPM to individual 
needs describes tailoring of the JPM by therapists to be 
responsive to individual men’s needs.
Conclusion: The findings evidence therapist’s acceptability and their 
moderate adherence to the JPM. Flexibility in delivery of the JPM 
enables adaptation of the model and co-production of therapy to 
meet men’s needs. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Suicide is a global public health concern accounting for over 700,000 deaths worldwide 
(WHO, 2021). While suicide affects both men and women, higher rates of suicide among 
men are recorded worldwide (Naghavi, 2019), with men accounting for three quarters 
(3925 deaths) of the 5224 suicide deaths recorded in England and Wales in 2020 
(ONS, 2021). Existing research evidence suggests pressure to conform to socialised tra-
ditional masculine ideals such as self-reliance, stoicism, and emotional self-control, 
hamper help-seeking among men experiencing psychological distress (Canetto and Saki-
nofsky, 1998 ; Pirkis et al., 2017; Seidler et al., 2016). Subsequently, men may engage in 
avoidant coping strategies, including substance misuse (e.g. alcohol and drugs), denial, 
aggressive, and risky behaviour to regain a perceived sense of control (Eggenberger 
et al., 2023; O’Gorman et al., 2022; Seidler et al., 2016, 2021).
Recent systematic review findings of research spanning 20 years found traditional 
norms of masculinity implicated in suicide risk among men in 96% of included 
studies (Bennett et al., 2023). Bennett et al. (2023) posit a 3 ‘D’ risk model to account 
for the relationship between traditional masculine ideals and increased suicide risk 
among men. Accordingly, the emergence of increasing psychological pain and suicide 
risk occurs from reciprocal interaction of denial, disconnection, and dysregulation 
within three core psychological areas of emotions (emotional suppression), self (failure 
to achieve standards of male success), and interpersonal connections (undermined 
social and relational needs); which in turn reflect individual expression of traditional 
masculine norms (Bennett et al., 2023). Furthermore, accumulating psychological pain 
may become amplified by distal and proximal risk factors an individual may be suscep -
tible to (Bennett et al., 2023).
Poor help-seeking due to various barriers, including shame and fear of mental illness 
diagnosis, is often blamed for men’s low engagement with mental health services (Cleary,  
2012; Luoma et al., 2002; Rasmussen et al., 2018). Arguably, this suggests that suicide pre-
vention support typically offered by mental health support services is not meeting the 
needs and preferences of men experiencing suicidal crisis. This highlights an issue 
with the type of support suicide prevention services traditionally offer men experiencing 
suicidal crisis. Research has shown that men experiencing suicidal crisis can find it 
difficult to discuss their emotions as it conflicts with their masculine status (Cleary,  
2012; River & Flood, 2021). This has led to calls for targeted suicide prevention services 
that are informal, community-based and ‘men-friendly’ (Oliffe et al., 2020; Seidler et al.,  
2018; Stiawa et al., 2020; Struszczyk et al., 2019), which consider the content and struc -
tural context in which men disclose their suicidal distress (Chandler, 2021). Research has 
also advocated the need to explore men’s experiences of suicide and to consult commu -
nity stakeholders to understand and build capacity within the design and delivery of 
suicide prevention services to meet men’s needs (Saini et al., 2022; Trail et al., 2021).
Established in 2018, James’ Place (JP) is the UK’s first community-based therapeutic 
suicide prevention centre for men. JP strives to redress issues of poor help-seeking and 
engagement among men experiencing suicidal crisis by facilitating rapid access to a brief 
clinical intervention called the JP Model (JPM). This is delivered within a community 
therapeutic setting by therapists trained to deliver the JPM and is adapted to suit individ -
ual men’s needs. The JPM is underpinned by three theories of suicide each promoting 2

safety planning and working with the individual to co-produce suicide prevention strat -
egies; namely the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner et al., 2009), the Collaborative 
Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) (Jobes, 2012), and the Integrated 
Motivational-Volitional Theory of Suicide (IMV) (O’Connor, 2011; O’Connor & 
Kirtley, 2018). The JPM is delivered by suicide prevention therapists and involves nine 
sessions structured into three stages, each composed of three sessions. Figure 1 shows 
how the JPM is typically delivered. Sessions one to three focus upon managing risk, 
ensuring the man is engaged in therapy and the lay your cards on the table (LYCT) com -
ponent of the intervention are introduced to help the man to articulate their suicidal dis-
tress; sessions four to six involve delivery of brief psychological interventions; and 
sessions seven to nine focus on relapse prevention and creation of an individualised, 
detailed safety plan. Further details of the JPM can be found elsewhere (Hanlon et al.,  
2022; Saini et al., 2019, 2020). Several studies have shown the JPM significantly 
reduces distress as demonstrated by a clinically significant reduction in Clinical Out-
comes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) scores (Chopra et al.,  
2022; Saini et al., 2020, 2022; Saini, Chopra, Hanlon, & Boland 2021; Saini, Chopra, 
Hanlon, Boland, & O’Donoghue 2021).
Fidelity refers to the extent an intervention is delivered as planned (Carroll et al., 2007; 
Gearing et al., 2011). Assessment of fidelity determines whether intervention outcomes 
can be attributed to intervention content and components, rather than unaccounted 
factors, such as variations in implementation and/or omission of intervention com -
ponents (Borrelli, 2011). Currently, there are JP centres in Liverpool and London, with 
plans for future expansion of the service. Expansion of JP will inherently mean more

therapists will be involved in delivering the JPM. This, in addition to the adaptable nature 
of the JPM, could potentially risk deviations away from delivery of the model as planned. 
It is pertinent to understand the degree of fidelity adherence in JPM delivery to ensure 
confidence in interpretation of reported outcomes and replication of this once JP is 
expanded. This study aimed to understand fidelity of JPM delivery within a therapeutic 
setting for men experiencing suicidal crisis. The perceived context-specific facilitators 
and barriers of the JPM were explored to provide insights into adherence of JPM delivery 
in practice and its perceived acceptability.
Materials and methods
Design
A mixed methods design was used. This allowed integration of objective and subjective 
data, an approach needed within suicide-related research (Kral et al., 2012). Specifically, 
it facilitated assessment of a range of quantitative data routinely collected by JP pertain -
ing to delivery of the JPM as planned (e.g. number of sessions men attended, frequency of 
delivery of LYCT) and exploration of therapists perceptions of factors associated with the 
men’s acceptability of, and fidelity to planned delivery of the JPM. Two facets of fidelity 
to the intended delivery of the JPM were assessed; (1) adherence to content of the JPM 
during delivery (fidelity of content); and (2) number of sessions delivered (fidelity of dur-
ation). Semi-structured interviews assessed therapists’ perceived acceptability and views 
of fidelity to delivery of the JPM. Ethical approval was given by Liverpool John Moores 
University Research Ethics Committee (reference: 21/PSY/007). Written consent was 
gained from men using the service during their initial welcome assessment for the 
purpose of reviewing their records for research and/or service evaluation purposes. 
Welcome assessments are conducted by JP therapists who are aware of ethical issues 
and considerations. Written consent was also gained from JP therapists whose clinical 
records were audited and who participated in semi-structured interviews.
Participants
Thirty of 101 cases of men who had received and completed the JP intervention during 
the period from 1st December 2020 to 30th November 2021 were randomly selected for 
auditing. To remove bias, an administrator who was not involved in delivery of therapy, 
randomly selected five completed cases for each therapist for auditing. The qualitative 
element of this study involved semi-structured interviews with eight therapists (5 
female) trained to deliver the JPM from JP Liverpool (n = 4) and JP London (n = 4) 
and were conducted between 5th November 2021 and 18th March 2022.
Quantitative phase: procedure and analysis
Document analyses of internal records auditing 30 cases, representing five cases per thera -
pist at JP Liverpool, were assessed to evaluate fidelity of adherence to the planned delivery 
of the JPM. The audit was conducted over two consecutive days in December 2021 by three 
JP staff (centre manager, clinical lead, and member of administrative staff) and a 4 
 C. A. HANLON ET AL.
researcher. On day one, the administrator and clinical lead completed a primary audit on 
the 30 randomly selected cases. Simultaneously, the researcher completed a secondary 
audit on 15 of those cases. Once each interview session was completed, both raters 
reviewed their individual score sheets separately. Each item was then jointly reviewed to 
identify and record disagreements and a consensus reached on the final score.
Each auditor recorded JPM components delivered against JPM content specification, 
for example duration (i.e. number of sessions attended) and content (e.g. completion of a 
safety plan and sets LYCT used), using an audit tool. The audit tool was co-produced 
between the clinical lead and administration staff and was developed using theoretical 
and clinical insights from current research and clinical practice. Points were given if 
therapists had delivered key components of the JPM including each of the four sets of 
LYCT and if a safety plan was uploaded onto the clinical information system. See  
Table 1 for the scoring scheme. Additional delivery features were assessed including 
the number of sessions delivered and how long men accessed the service for. Adherence 
was calculated by adding the points awarded and scored out of a maximum score of 10. JP 
deemed a score of less than 5 (range 0–4) as an unacceptable level of adherence and a 
score of 5 and above as acceptable (range 5–10). Inter-rater reliability was compared 
against primary and secondary audits of individual cases. Disagreements between the 
primary and secondary audit were resolved through examination and discussion of indi-
vidual case records between three auditors. Descriptive analyses of audit materials were 
conducted independently by the research team.
Qualitative phase: procedure and analysis
Semi-structured interviews with therapists explored their views on fidelity of delivery of 
the JPM, including barriers and facilitators that may influence their delivery of the model. 
Perceived acceptability of the JPM was explored to understand service-user-related 
factors that may affect fidelity. Interviews were conducted either face-to-face (n = 4) or 
online (n = 4) and were audio-recorded using a Dictaphone, ranging from 42 to 
66 minutes. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using reflexive the-
matic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2019). Trustworthiness of qualitative data was 
achieved as each interview was read in a process of data familiarisation, and initial 
codes and themes were developed through an iterative process of theme development

reviewed the themes developed with the primary researcher when refining, revisiting, 
and finalising the themes; thus ensuring rigour and transparency (Yardley, 2000).
Results
Quantitative findings
Audit results are presented in Table 2 and confirmed adherence scores for completed 
cases ranged from 2 to 9 (M = 5.67, SD = 2.01) indicating a medium level of adherence 
to planned delivery of the JPM. Fidelity delivery of the four sets of LYCT, scored out 
of 0–5, varied from no cards being delivered to all four sets of LYCT being delivered 
(M = 2.67, SD = 1.94; range 0–5). Number of sessions ranged from 2 to 16 sessions (M  
= 8.17, SD = 2.79; range 2–16) and safety plans were recorded in 21 of 30 cases (70%). 
A reduction in CORE-OM score upon discharge from the service was recorded in 
every audited case, except for one case where a reduction in suicidality was reported 
within the clinical case notes. Secondary audit scores achieved moderate inter-rater 
reliability (agreement in 9 of 15 cases; 60%). Disagreement between the primary and sec-
ondary audit was largely due to the researcher’s unfamiliarity with the clinical infor -
mation system and difficulty locating the required information. All disagreements 
were resolved by reviewing clinical case notes and discussion between the auditors.
Qualitative findings
Five themes were identified (Therapeutic environment; Specialised suicide prevention 
training; Therapy engagement; Person-centred care and Adapting the JPM to individual 
needs) and are summarised below with illustrative quotes.
Theme 1: therapeutic environment: the third therapist (N = 6)
The therapeutic environment at JP is purposely non-clinical and its importance was 
noted by therapists.
An environment that speaks to masculinity (n = 4).The physical environment at JP was 
perceived by therapists to speak to men’s masculinity in a way that contrasts with tra-
ditional mental health services by engendering a person-focused, safe, and non-judge -
mental ‘space’ for men to feel confident to disclose their suicidality; 
I must say, again, in my 20-odd years of doing therapy, it’s such a unique environment. It’s an 
environment I would not normally associate with therapeutic intervention … It’s normally a 
cupboard underneath a staircase with no windows. So, actually being in an environment 
which is open, which feels like a living room, actually. And the men notice that when they 
come in. (Therapist 6)
This facilitates engagement from men, allowing them to become visible and heard as 
their suicidal distress and experiences are validated without being stigmatised; 
The environment, and everything else like that, it’s not like going somewhere where somebody 
is going to label you. (Therapist 2)6

Developing therapeutic alliance (n = 3).Therapists contribute to the therapeutic 
environment by cultivating therapeutic alliance with the men. This may involve reflecting 
the man’s composure, or upon their own experiences to gain trust and develop rapport; 
‘I think personal experience is great. Because I have children myself, that is always useful. So, 
when men talk about their children, that’s relatable … I have been divorced, so relationship 
breakdown, that is something that … I think it’s about personal experience. What is it that 
can come up, that can emerge, that can connect you and this man in a way that they have 
never been engaged with before?’ Therapist 6
Theme 2: specialised suicide prevention training (N = 7)
While JP therapists are qualified, each received additional specialised suicide prevention 
training from the JP clinical lead.
Formal training (n = 7).Training examined key areas including suicide risk factors, 
theoretical underpinnings of the JPM and the LYCT component. Therapists perceived 
training provided a framework for delivering the JPM. However, it is real-world experi -
ence of delivering the JPM that increases their confidence to foster flexibility when co- 
producing therapy with the men; 
Yes, I did find it useful because before I’d never worked in that way with cards. I just did lit-
erally talking therapy, person-centred talking therapy. This was new and different, but very 
useful. Yes, I think it gave me enough knowledge or prepared me enough to then be able to 
put it in practice. (Therapist 1)
Informal colleague support (n = 3).Therapists described benefiting from receiving 
additional support given from more experienced therapists during informal, incidental 
conversations and weekly case management meetings. This was received from colleagues 
separate to their clinical supervision and was viewed to offer new therapists’ assurance 
they were delivering the JPM correctly and allowed them to envisage how they might 
co-produce therapy with men; 
I think at first when I first started, I was very rigid with the training that I was given and the 
cards had to be done every single session and if I didn’t use the cards in the session I was doing 
it wrong. Whereas now I think it’s more organic, you bring the training that you received at the 
beginning as well as the cards, but it doesn’t have to be in every session. One size doesn’t fit all 
does it with our clients? (Therapist 3)
Developing training (n = 6).Formal review of therapist progression shortly after assign -
ment of their own caseload was identified by therapists as a potential improvement to 
training. Additionally, inclusion of case studies could enhance knowledge as to how to 
integrate additional therapeutic strategies within JPM delivery; 
I think doing some case studies would be really helpful. It would have been, probably, 
really helpful to see maybe one of the more senior therapists actually talk through, ‘This is 
how I would tend to use the cards,’ or, ‘These are the things that change between clients. 
(Therapist 4)8 
 C. A. HANLON ET AL.
Maybe like a check-in later, so you could have the initial training and then you could have a 
three-month check-in, so like, ‘How’s it going?’ and a refresher, ‘How have you actually found 
it in practice? (Therapist 8)
Supervision: caring for the carers (n = 8).Therapists received supervision both internally 
within JP and from an external provider as part of their professional registration. Both were 
perceived as essential for maintaining well-being. Internal supervision allowed therapists to 
reflect upon their clinical practice, and to seek support for more challenging cases; 
Yes, it’s good to be able to offload for yourself. It’s good when you feel stuck with somebody, 
like, ‘How do you do this? (Therapist 2)
Conversely, therapists could confidentially explore issues relating to their clinical practice 
to gain an objective, non-judgemental perspective during external supervision; 
Well, I actually think it’s really useful that it is external in some ways, because some of the things 
that might stress me out here might be things that I don’t particularly feel comfortable talking 
about here. So, it’s, kind of, nice to have both of those types of supervision. (Therapist 4)
Theme 3: therapy engagement (N = 8)
Face-to-face delivery, availability of rapid access to, and the brief duration of, the JPM 
were identified as key facilitators in promoting the acceptability of the JPM among 
men accessing the service. However, therapists encounter some challenges adhering to 
the specified number of sessions within the JPM;
Accessibility and acceptability of therapy (n = 8).Seeing men during their crisis was per-
ceived as validating of their experience, and facilitated a safe, therapeutic space to discuss 
suicide whilst developing effective therapeutic strategies; 
So, for me, it is that swiftness of getting people in, and then that just being able to talk. It is just 
a space to say, ‘What’s happening for you?’ and, ‘How are you coping with that? What can we 
do to keep you safe?’ So, somebody is really saying to you, ‘Yes, what you’re feeling is worrying.’ 
Somebody is validating, and then giving you the support of, ‘But we can keep you safe,’ well, 
‘We can help you to keep you safe. (Therapist 2)
Reasons why men disengage were speculated and included removal of a major stressor 
(e.g. gaining employment), which alleviated suicidal distress. Interestingly, therapists 
felt some men found ending therapy difficult, speculating non-attendance to their final 
scheduled session may be empowering; 
Usually the guys, they’ve done well and everything is done, the next session is to finalise things. 
They decide to not attend the last session. (Therapist 1)
But also, if something else comes up within their lives, where they feel, ‘I can’t make that session,’ or, ‘I 
think I’ve had enough of this now,’ I think it’s okay to make that decision. And I think it’s up to us to 
support that decision, because that’s all part and parcel of the empowerment of those men. (Therapist 6)
Keeping therapy brief (n = 5).The number of planned sessions within the JPM was per-
ceived as acceptable and suitable. Adhering to this could be challenging and required HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE

therapists to manage their own expectations of what can be achieved within a brief interven -
tion and to recognise a man’s recovery may continue once they have completed the JPM; 
It’s just about touching on things which can be recognised as a really important issue for some -
body, without having to go into too much detail. Not getting sucked into it within the short 
time we have. I think it’s quite useful to know it, and to notice it, and to recognise it, 
without having that. That’s powerful. (Therapist 7)
Theme 4: person-centred care (N = 8)
Therapists had comprehensive understanding of the JPM and its constituent elements, 
including the LYCT.
Normalising sharing of suicidal experiences (n = 8).LYCT were perceived by therapists 
to allow men to visualise and voice their suicidal distress, when previously they have felt 
unable to share their suicidal experiences. Self-compassion emerged as the men recog -
nised the burden of having such a lot to contend with; thus destigmatising suicidal 
distress; 
… it’s when there’s that, kind of, real fear around what they’re experiencing that I find it’s so 
important to normalise it and it’s so important to say, ‘Actually, you’re not the only person to 
feel this way. These are some of the reasons why you may be feeling this way and you do have 
some element of control and some options available to you. (Therapist 4)
Delivery of the LYCT was described as a short-cut to instigating dialogue between the 
therapist and men, bringing focus to each session. Men’s experiences informed the thera -
pists clinical judgment and practice as they guided the men through their crisis in a 
person-centred, but solution focused way. Resultantly, the JPM is rapid, timely and 
targeted; 
I suppose what the cards do is they short-circuit all the longwinded discussions that may go on, 
but it brings it straight to the specific. And we also have to bear in mind that we’re a time- 
limited service, so the earlier we can get to what the specific issues are, then it provides 
more time for us to really sieve that through and work that through. (Therapist 6)
Co-production in action (n = 8).Co-production featured in different elements of the JPM 
including the inclusion of therapeutic strategies and safety planning. This allows thera -
pists to work collaboratively by standing together, shoulder-to-shoulder with men to co- 
produce and adapt the JPM to find solutions to their crisis. Therapists reported that they 
delivered the JPM in a manageable way that did not set expectations beyond the man’s 
reach such as omitting the LYCT component if the man is too distressed to engage 
with them; 
So, it’s really just about making sure that it’s an open conversation right from the start and 
that they feel that they can, you know, slow things down or change direction if they need 
to, so, yes. (Therapist 4)
‘Sometimes I think they’re [lay your cards on the table] not needed and sometimes I think a 
client just needs to have a counselling session … ’ Therapist 310 
 C. A. HANLON ET AL.
In this sense, co-production facilitates a shift from ‘one size fits all’ approaches to suicide 
prevention; 
I think in terms of co-production, I really feel that I can’t work the same with every person. So, 
I think the treatment, or so to speak, maybe even treatment’s a bit of a clinical word, but the 
intervention process is so tailored to each man. Like, uniquely. It’s not cookie-cutter, it’s not 
one size- (Therapist 5)
Theme 5: adapting the JPM to individual needs (N = 8)
Tolerance of flexibility in the delivery of JPM components was reported, particularly with 
the LYCT component, to address the needs of each individual man.
Flexibility in implementation of lay your cards on the table (n = 8).Men were reported to 
interact with the LYCT in different ways, such as grouping relevant themes together or 
taking photographs of them to reflect upon their progress. Similarly, therapists described 
different ways of delivering the LYCT to suit each man’s presentation, preserve their 
safety and to respond to changing needs during therapy. For example, integrating the 
language of the cards into their discussions rather than physically administering them, 
and omitting/alternating the order in which they are delivered; 
Sometimes when someone doesn’t have any coping strategies, or think they don’t have any 
coping strategies, then sometimes I would do the, ‘How can I get through this first?’ if 
they’re very much in a distressed state. (Therapist 1)
They’ve either been covered in the person saying the story, or just in the session. So, you know, 
I’ve done a few sessions where we’ve not used them at all, but we’ve done it- If you know what I 
mean. So, they’ve not physically gone through the cards, but that’s what we’ve been talking 
about. (Therapist 2)
Flexibility was perceived as essential to facilitate adaptation of JPM and to ensure men’s 
needs are met ahead of the need to rigidly administer the JPM chronologically and in its 
entirety; 
I think it’s very useful to be flexible. Flexible, robust and adaptable, I think is the right answer 
to that. Because you never know what men will bring, from one week to the next … that man 
may be going back into a turbulent situation after leaving the session. (Therapist 6)
Necessity of safety planning (n = 5).Safety planning was viewed as an uncompromising 
JPM component by therapists as it documented actions men could initiate to keep them -
selves safe. Co-production of this occurred at different stages of the therapeutic journey; 
I mean, I think that’s quite helpful. We’ve even had some men who, once you’d done that, they 
were like, ‘Oh, I’m okay,’ do you know what I mean? So, the safety plan, in itself, is a really 
positive thing. (Therapist 2)
I always do a safety plan with men. That might be at the beginning if I think someone is a 
really high-risk. They also can be towards the end …  (Therapist 5)
Flexibility promotes use of additional therapeutic tools (n = 8).Therapist autonomy is 
respected within the JPM allowing them to introduce additional therapeutic techniques HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 
 11
when tailoring its delivery. A range of additional techniques were reported to support 
men in developing resilience and coping skills including CBT-based approaches, self- 
compassion and psychoeducation; 
I think there’s a little bit of psychoeducation that I offer alongside what we’re doing here, so 
things like understanding anxiety, how anxiety actually works in the body and, therefore, 
what we can do to try and manage it. I think that’s something that I offer that doesn’t necess -
arily come from the cards that seems to be really helpful …  (Therapist 4)
Discussion
Summary of findings
This is the first study to evaluate fidelity of delivery of the JPM and was comprised of two 
phases: an audit of clinical cases of men accessing JP and semi-structured interviews with 
therapists trained to deliver the JPM exploring their perspectives of adherence and 
acceptability of the JPM. Descriptive analyses of JP audit notes revealed moderate 
levels of adherence to specification of intended delivery of the JPM amongst therapists. 
Audit notes and semi-structured interview findings highlighted components of JPM that 
required tailoring according to individual men’s needs including LYCT and safety 
planning.
Several facilitators of acceptability of the JPM among men experiencing suicidal crisis 
and adherence to the specification of model delivery were encompassed within five 
themes. The first theme, therapeutic environment: the third therapist highlighted impor -
tance of the therapeutic setting for engaging suicidal men. The second theme identified 
specialised suicide prevention training in the JPM that facilitated therapists understanding 
and expertise. The third theme, therapy engagement which improved engagement in 
therapy among men. The fourth theme identified was person-centred care related to 
co-production and timeliness of the introduction of the LYCT or safety planning 
tools. The final theme adapting the JPM to individual needs within the parameters of 
the JPM structure, was identified as necessary for facilitating the adaptation of the 
JPM to suit men’s needs.
Clinical implications
Collectively, the factors identified were perceived by therapists to allow men to feel heard, 
visible, and held in a safe space while discussing their suicidal crisis. Men have historically 
been considered a challenging population to engage in traditional mental health support 
services due to poor help-seeking behaviours (Cleary, 2012, 2017) associated with mascu -
line ideals such as stoicism, self-reliance, and shame (Pirkis et al., 2017; Rasmussen et al.,  
2018; Seidler et al., 2021). Emerging evidence challenges the narrative around masculinity 
and suicidal men’s help-seeking behaviours (Chandler, 2021). For example, Richardson, 
Dickson et al. (2021) explored suicide from attempt to recovery among men, finding 
most men had recognised their need for mental health support. However, they did not 
know where to go or how to ask for support. This suggests that existing mental health 
services do not have sufficient acceptability and/or reach among men experiencing 
suicidal crisis. Findings elsewhere echo this point, reporting the need for informal, 12 
 C. A. HANLON ET AL.
community-based mental health service provision for men which offers tailored, colla -
borative person-centred care to enhance accessibility and engagement (Player et al.,  
2015; Seidler et al., 2018; Struszczyk et al., 2019).
JP is embedded within the local community and offers rapid access to person-focused 
brief psychological support. JP has enabled an establishment of close working partner -
ships and referral pathways with local community support services. This allows JP thera -
pists to refer men to local services for additional psychosocial issues such as debt 
management, housing and alcohol and drug services. JPM principles (e.g. rapid access, 
referral pathways, environment) align with key priorities highlighted within health 
care initiatives across the UK such as the ‘Time, Space, Compassion’ strategy in Scotland 
(National Suicide prevention Leadership Group, 2021) and the National Suicide Preven -
tion Strategy (Department of Health and Social Care, 2023). The former outlines a frame -
work advocating integration of timely access to therapeutic space offering compassionate 
care which is sensitive and empathetic towards the needs of the individual experiencing 
suicidal crisis (National Suicide prevention Leadership Group, 2021). While the National 
Suicide Prevention Strategy emphasises the role of front-line services such as those that 
are third sector and community-based, in providing tailored suicide crisis intervention to 
high-risk priority groups, including middle-aged men (Department of Health and Social 
Care, 2023).
Brevity of duration of the JPM was perceived as a striking intervention feature by the 
therapists. Research supports the efficacy of brief psychological interventions for suicidal 
crisis where they deliver early intervention; the provision of targeted information about 
suicide (e.g. understanding and management of suicide) and safety planning is given, and 
sustained follow-up occurs (McCabe et al., 2018). Studies have shown that the JPM as a 
brief psychological intervention reduces suicide among men (Chopra et al., 2022; Saini 
et al., 2020, 2022; Saini, Chopra, Hanlon, & Boland 2021; Saini, Chopra, Hanlon, 
Boland, & O’Donoghue 2021). Although, therapists in the present study highlighted 
the acceptance that some men may go on to receive further support from additional ser-
vices also (e.g. for housing/unemployment issues or traumatic childhood experiences).
There is a structure and expectation that therapists will deliver each core component 
of the JPM including the LYCT, safety planning and the CORE evaluation question -
naires. Audit results revealed delivery of the LYCT varied across cases. Therapists 
reflected during interviews that LYCT delivery was not always appropriate for every 
man, and perceived that flexibility and co-production facilitated within the parameters 
of the JPM was a pre-requisite for shifting away from universal approaches to suicide pre-
vention. This finding adds to calls for tailored suicide prevention interventions for men 
experiencing suicidal crisis (Player et al., 2015; Seidler et al., 2018; Struszczyk et al., 2019).
Therapists described utlising their clinical judgment to adapt delivery of the JPM 
content to address the complexities of each individual man’s crisis (e.g. omitting 
LYCT and/or delivery of additional therapeutic strategies). This practice was also 
evident from audit documents. Balancing fidelity of delivery with the adaptation of the 
JPM for individual men without diminishing mechanisms of change poses a significant 
challenge to therapists delivering the model and researchers evaluating its effectiveness. 
Regular auditing of JPM delivery adherence during case management meetings could 
offer a feasible way to evaluate fidelity without compromising determination of the 
JPM’s effectiveness.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 
 13
Safety planning was perceived by therapists as an essential component of the JPM. 
However, audit findings revealed that 70% of cases had safety plans documented onto the 
clinical information system. Several reasons may account for safety plans not being documen -
ted. For example, some men prefer a digital safety plan accessible via their mobile phone app’s 
(e.g. the Stay Alive app). The clinical information system in use at the time of the audit did not 
have a facility for therapists to upload copies of safety plans developed this way. Therefore, a 
safety plan may have completed but not uploaded onto the clinical information system.
Audit results have been used to guide development of a newly introduced clinical 
information system and to further improve clinical practice and training. For example, 
audit results indicated inconsistent use of the LYCT component of the JPM. An audit 
score of 5 out of 10 is considered acceptable, however if no sets of cards of the LYCT 
component is used, then intervention delivery is considered non-adherent. Measures 
have now been put in place such that a case review is triggered if the ‘What’s happening 
now’ cards have not been introduced by session three.
Strengths and limitations
This study challenges the perception that men do not seek help for suicidal crisis, adding 
to literature highlighting the need for informal, community-based mental health service 
provision for men experiencing suicidal crisis. However, generalisability of the audit 
findings is limited as they only reflect the data of men accessing JP and it is not possible 
to establish how delivery of the JPM may be required to change to engage men not acces -
sing the service to be effective in reducing suicidal distress. As with any suicide preven -
tion intervention study, suicidal distress may reduce without psychological intervention 
(Chopra et al., 2022). Therefore, it is feasible reduction in suicidal distress observed 
within the sample was not attributable to the JPM (Chopra et al., 2022). However, 
research evidence suggests the JPM significantly reduces suicidal distress among men 
(Chopra et al., 2022; Saini et al., 2020, 2022; Saini, Chopra, Hanlon, & Boland 2021; 
Saini, Chopra, Hanlon, Boland, & O’Donoghue 2021).
The study also provided valuable insights into fidelity of delivery and identification of the 
facilitators and barriers that may influence acceptability and implementation of the JPM but 
neglects the views of men who engaged with JP. Involving JP staff provided invaluable exper -
tise when navigating the clinical recording system and extracting data during the audit 
process. Additionally, the audit tool which assessed adherence of delivery fidelity while clini -
cally informed, was developed internally by JP. This could have introduced bias into the audit 
procedure such as observer bias whereby JP staff unconsciously recorded fidelity of interven -
tion components more favourably (e.g. presence of a safety plan when it was not recorded on 
the system). Steps were taken to ensure random selection of completed cases for therapists, 
and first and second coder independence in assessing adherence of therapist delivery of the 
JPM. However, a range of fidelity assessment methods are recommended (Bellg et al., 2004).
Future research
Future research should seek to explore the views of men accessing JP to gain further 
understanding of factors that may influence implementation of the JPM. Also, the 14 
 C. A. HANLON ET AL.
types and frequency of additional therapeutic approaches used by therapists should be 
assessed and linked to behaviour change techniques to further understanding of JPM 
components attributable to suicidality reduction. Lastly, additional methods to assess 
fidelity of the JPM should be deployed in future evaluations. Gold standard approaches 
include using observation methods (e.g. video- or audio-recorded sessions) and/or self- 
report methods (Bellg et al., 2004). However, it is important to note this study evaluated 
delivery fidelity and does not provide an assessment of the quality of delivery such as 
therapeutic competence.
Conclusion
Findings support the need for clinical pathways and mental health service provision that 
holistically considers the complexities of suicide among men, such as that offered by JP. 
Seeking to standardise every aspect of the JPM is not feasible given the individual nature 
of suicidal crisis. Rather, moderate delivery fidelity to core components of the JPM is 
achievable when tailoring the model to address men’s individual needs.
