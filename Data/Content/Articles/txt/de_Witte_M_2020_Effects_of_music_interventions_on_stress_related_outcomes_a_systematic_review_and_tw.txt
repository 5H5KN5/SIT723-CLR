ABSTRACT
Music interventions are used for stress reduction in a variety of settings
because of the positive e ﬀects of music listening on both physiological
arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, and hormonal levels) andpsychological stress experiences (e.g., restlessness, anxiety, andnervousness). To summarize the growing body of empirical research,
two multilevel meta-analyses of 104 RCTs, containing 327 e ﬀect sizes
and 9,617 participants, were performed to assess the strength of theeﬀects of music interventions on both physiological and psychological
stress-related outcomes, and to test the potential moderators of the
intervention e ﬀects. Results showed that music interventions had an
overall signi ﬁcant e ﬀect on stress reduction in both physiological ( d
= .380) and psychological ( d= .545) outcomes. Further, moderator
analyses showed that the type of outcome assessment moderated the
eﬀects of music interventions on stress-related outcomes. Larger e ﬀects
were found on heart rate ( d= .456), compared to blood pressure ( d
=.343) and hormone levels ( d= .349). Implications for stress-reducing
music interventions are discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Stress is believed to be one of the major factors negatively a ﬀecting our health. High stress levels
have shown to be strongly associated with many physical and emotional problems, such as cardio-
vascular disease, chronic pain, anxiety disorders, depression, burnout, and addictions (AmericanPsychological Association [APA], 2017 ; Australian Psychological Society [APS], 2015 ; Casey, 2017 ;
Howe, Chang, & Johnson, 2013 ; McEwen & Gianaros, 2010 ). Furthermore, there is a strong relationship
between these stress-related health problems and higher absenteeism at work (UK Health and SafetyExecutive, 2016 ). To cope with stressors, millions of people around the world use tranquilising medi-
cation, which is associated with numerous contraindications and negative side eﬀ ects (e.g., Bandelow
et al., 2015 ; Olfson, King, & Schoenbaum, 2015 ; Puetz, Youngstedt, & Herring, 2015 ). Because of the
diﬃculty of reducing or preventing stress without any professional support and the great demand for

nonpharmacological stress reduction interventions, the relevance of the development of cost-e ﬀective
interventions for stress reduction is high (Casey, 2017 ; Holahan, Moos, Holahan, Brennan, & Schutte,
2005 ; Howe et al., 2013 ; McEwen & Gianaros, 2010 ; World Health Organization [WHO], 2010 ).
Music listening and music making have been associated with a broad range of positive out-
comes in the domains of health and well-being (Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008;K o e l s c h ,2012, 2015;
Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014 ; Zatorre, 2015). The most widely studied e ﬀects of music are the
calming and stress reducing e ﬀects (Chanda & Levitin, 2013; Gillen, Biley, & Allen, 2008; Juslin &
Västfjäll, 2008 ;K o e l s c h , 2015). For decades, music has been used as an intervention for stress
reduction, such as music activities (like singing or music making), music listening for a certain
patient group ( ‘music as medicine ’), and live music therapy o ﬀered by music therapists (Bradt,
Dileo, & Shim, 2013b ;G o l de ta l . ,2011).
In order to integrate the available knowledge on the eﬀ ects of music interventions on stress, the
present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies testing the e ﬀects of
music interventions on both physiological and psychological stress-related outcomes in clinical,
medical and work- or study-related settings.
The stress system
The stress system can be considered as a highly important and preserved system in human beings. In
physiology and medicine, the general deﬁ nition of stress is introduced by Selye ( 1956 ):‘Stress is a
general activation reaction to a stimulus that could mean both a challenge (in a positive way) and
a threat (in a negative sense)’ (p. 32). Aldwin ( 2007 ) emphasized the negative part and de ﬁned
stress as the quality of an experience, produced through a person-environment transaction that,
through either overarousal or underarousal, results in psychological or physiological distress
(Aldwin, 2007 ; Riley & Park, 2015 ). The responses to stress can be categorised as physiological
arousal and emotional responses (e.g., Aldwin, 2007 ; Li & Goldsmith, 2012 ; Pelletier, 2004 ). Together,
the underlying systems of these responses regulate stress and a ﬀect each other during stress (e.g.,
Linnemann, Strahler, & Nater, 2017 ; McEwen & Gianaros, 2010 ).
The physiological response to stress implies the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal
(HPA) axis and, because of a release of adrenalin and noradrenalin, increased activity of the sympath-etic nervous system resulting in increased physiological arousal, such as heartrate, blood pressure,
and cardiac output (Bally, Campbell, Chesnick, & Tranmer, 2003 ; McCance,Forshee, & Shelby, 2006 ;
Pfaﬀ , Martin, & Ribeiro, 2007 ). In a parallel process, involving the hypothalamus and the adrenal
glands, cortisol is released. The emotional response to stress can be described as emotional statesof subjective worry, such as state anxiety, restlessness or nervousness (Akin & Iskender, 2011 ;
Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983 ; Pittman & Kridli, 2011 ; Pritchard, 2009 ).State anxiety has
been deﬁ ned as an emotional response to an individual’ s perception of a stressful experience (e.g.,
Hook, Songwathana, & Petpichetchian, 2008 ; Koelsch, Fuermetz, et al., 2011a ; Ng et al., 2016 ;
Zhang et al., 2014 ). Therefore, state anxiety was operationalised for several decades as one of the
psychological stress-related outcomes (Koelsch, Fuermetz, et al., 2011a ; Lazarus, 1966 ; Pelletier,
2004 ). It is assumed that both the physiological and the emotional responses of stress may be
reduced by music (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Dileo & Bradt, 2007 ; Pelletier, 2004 ).
Eﬀects of music on stress
Recent neuroscienti ﬁc studies provide insights into how music interventions may lead to stress
reduction and increased well-being. Firstly, music seems to be able to decrease physiological
arousal , which is increased during stress. Music listening, and music making/singing, have been
associated with decreases of physiological arousal, shown by reduction of cortisol levels or decreasein heart rate and blood pressure (Hodges, 2011 ; Koelsch et al., 2016 ; Kreutz, Murcia, & Bongard, 2012 ;
Leardi et al., 2007 ; Linnemann, Ditzen, Strahler, Doerr, & Nater, 2015 ; Nilsson, 2009 ; Sokhadze, 2007 ).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 295
These three outcomes have been identi ﬁed in neurobiology as distinct stress biomarkers (Cacioppo,
Tassinary, & Berntson, 2007 ; Pfaﬀet al., 2007 ).
Music may also aﬀ ect stress-related emotional states , such as subjective worry, anxiety, restless-
ness or nervousness (Akin & Iskender, 2011; Cohen et al., 1983; Pittman & Kridli, 2011; Pritchard,
2009). This is because music can modulate activity in brain structures that are known to be crucially
involved in emotional processes. Recent neuroimaging studies on music and emotion showed that
music may strongly in ﬂuence the amygdala, a part of the limbic system, which is a section of the
brain that plays a crucial role in the regulation of emotional processes by releasing endorphins.
These neurotransmitters play an important role in enhancing a sense of well-being (Blood &
Zatorre, 2001;H o d g e s , 2011; Koelsch, 2015; Koelsch, Siebel, & Fritz, 2011b ;L e v i t i n ,2009 ;M o o r e ,
2013; Thaut & Wheeler, 2010; Uhlig, Jaschke, & Scherder, 2013; Zatorre, 2015 ).
The systematic review of Moore ( 2013 ) on the neurological e ﬀects of music on emotional pro-
cesses indicated that musical improvisation and music listening could deactivate the amygdala,
which may decrease the intensity of stress-related emotional states and psychophysiologicalarousal. This in turn has been shown to evoke feelings of pleasure and happiness (Blood &
Zatorre, 2001 ; Koelsch et al., 2016 ; Koelsch, O ﬀermanns, & Franzke, 2010 ; Limb & Braun, 2008 ). The
(cognitive) behavioural framework is consistent with this and takes into account that music can
serve as a distractor, diverting attention from a stressful event to something more pleasant, which
reduces stress levels (Sendelbach, Halm, Doran, Miller, & Gaillard, 2006 ; Vaajoki, Kankkunen, Pietilä,
& Vehviläinen-Julkunen, 2011 ).
Many studies on the eﬀ ects of music considered state anxiety to be a stress-related emotional
state, examining relationships between state anxiety outcomes and physiological stress-related out-
comes (e.g., Hook et al., 2008 ; Koelsch, Fuermetz, et al., 2011a ; Ng et al., 2016 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ).
Although the terms state anxiety and stress are used interchangeably in the psychology literature,
diﬀerent self-reporting questionnaires are used. It is therefore necessary to examine whether
music has the same e ﬀects on stress and state anxiety.
Music interventions
Music interventions can be regarded as purposeful musical exercises or methods in which music lis-
tening, music making, or singing is central. In both literature and practice there is a distinction
between music interventions o ﬀered by a music therapist and music interventions o ﬀered by
other healthcare professionals or without any support. First, music interventions can be de ﬁned as
purposeful music activities if they concern listening to prerecorded music oﬀ ered by medical or
healthcare professionals, if the intervention is self-administered by the patient ( ‘music as medicine ’),
or if it concerns music making or singing without the involvement of a music therapist or a thera-
peutic context (American Music Therapy Association, 2019 ). Second, music interventions as a part
ofmusic therapy are oﬀered by trained music therapists and are characterised by the presence of
a therapeutic process and the use of personal music experiences (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Bradt et al.,
2013b ; Dileo, 2006 ; Gold et al., 2011 ; Kamioka et al., 2014 ). Music interventions in the practice of
music therapy may concern music listening or music playing, but may also include composing, song-
writing, or interacting with music (Leubner & Hinterberger, 2017 ).
It is assumed that speci ﬁc characteristics of the music may have an impact on the stress-reducing
eﬀects of music interventions (e.g., Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Bradt, Dileo, & Potvin, 2013a ; Pittman & Kridli,
2011 ).Music tempo can be considered as one of the most important moderators of music-related
arousal and relaxation. Music with a slow tempo (60 –80 bpm), for example meditative music, has
often been associated with reductions in heart rate, resulting in greater relaxation (e.g., Bernardi,Porta, & Sleight, 2006 ; Bringman, Giesecke, Thörne, & Bringman, 2009 ; Chlan, 2000 ; Hilz et al., 2014 ;
Nomura, Yoshimura, & Kurosawa, 2013 ). The use of instrumental music , instead of music with lyrics ,
would often lead to greater e ﬀects of music interventions on stress reduction. Several studies
reported that music containing lyrics may be more distracting and activating instead of calming296 M .D EW I T T EE TA L .
(Good et al., 2000 ; Halpern & Savary, 1985 ). However, Koelsch et al. ( 2011a ) reported that the use of
music with lyrics may reinforce the positive e ﬀects of music interventions on stress reduction through
the possible comforting eﬀ ects of the lyrics. Another component of music interventions for stress
reduction is the way the music is played (live music or prerecorded music). Music therapy consists
mainly of live music interventions, which are assumed be more e ﬀective than ‘music as medicine ’
interventions because music therapists individualise their interventions to meet patients ’speciﬁc
needs (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Dileo, 1999 ,2006 ). Notably, some studies measured di ﬀerences in
stress responses between participants receiving live music and those receiving prerecorded music,with live music appearing to be the most stress-reducing (e.g., Arnon et al., 2006 ; Bailey, 1983 ;
Baker, 2001 ).
Many studies examining the e ﬀects of music interventions on stress-related outcomes in speci ﬁc
patient groups or settings have been published, such as cancer patients (Bradt, Dileo, Grocke, &
Magill, 2011 ), coronary heart disease patients (Bradt et al., 2013a ), and patients undergoing endo-
scopic procedures (Rudin, Kiss, Wetz, & Sottile, 2007 ). Several studies reported positive e ﬀects of
music-listening on stress-related outcomes. In medical settings, listening to tranquilising musicbefore, during, and after medical procedures has been reported to correlate with lower cortisol
levels, associated with the reduction of stress and/or anxiety (e.g., Chanda & Levitin, 2013 ;
Kamioka et al., 2014 ; Koelsch et al., 2016 ; Linnemann et al., 2015 ; Nilsson, 2008 ). However, the strength
of the e ﬀect di ﬀers both within and between studies, and the particular impact of potential modera-
tors –such as patient/client, setting, measurement and intervention characteristics –is largely
unknown.
Rationale for the present study
The present study consists of two multilevel meta-analyses on the e ﬀects of music interventions on
both physiological stress-related arousal (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, hormone levels) andpsychological stress-related experiences (e.g., state anxiety, restlessness or nervousness) in various
populations and settings, and is a replication of the meta-analysis by Pelletier ( 2004 ), who reviewed
22 quantitative studies examining the eﬀ ects of music interventions on stress reduction. Pelletier ’s
(2004 ) meta-analysis showed that music alone and music-assisted relaxation signi ﬁcantly reduced
stress-related arousal, with an overall medium-to-large eﬀ ect size of d= .67, moderated by study
characteristics, such as age, type of stress, musical preference and type of intervention. An important
diﬀerence with the present study is that Pelletier included only studies in which the intervention con-
sisted of listening to prerecorded music, often combined with relaxation techniques, whereas studieswith live music interventions were excluded. Besides, studies examining music therapy for stress
reduction were not included. The quality of the included studies was not assessed. Therefore, it is
not clear whether the methodology of the studies did inﬂ uence Pelletier ’s overall e ﬀects. In addition,
we assume that the study quality of comparable studies has increased over the last 15 years.
In the last decade, music interventions were increasingly developed and used to reduce stress in a
variety of settings (Chanda & Levitin, 2013 ; Heiderscheit, Chlan, & Donley, 2011 ; Koelsch, 2015 ; Uhlig
et al., 2013 ), and to support physical and psychological health by creating an environment that stimu-
lates relaxation and stress reduction (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Kamioka et al., 2014 ; Koelsch & Stegemann,
2012 ; Nilsson, 2008 ). Therefore, it is timely to replicate the meta-analysis by Pelletier ( 2004 ) by using
new multilevel meta-analytic techniques that enable moderator analyses of both within and between
study di ﬀerences in outcomes, thus preventing loss of information and increasing statistical power
(Assink & Wibbelink, 2016 ).
The present meta-analytic study includes all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the e ﬀects of
music interventions on stress-related outcomes in adults, who are not suﬀering from dementia,
that have been published. The ﬁrst aim of this study is to examine whether, and the degree to
which, music interventions are e ﬀective in reducing stress. The second aim is to examine possible
moderator e ﬀects of study, sample and intervention characteristics, which may in ﬂuence the strengthHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 297
of the e ﬀects of music interventions on stress-related outcomes. The results of this meta-analysis may
be used to increase the e ﬀects of music interventions on stress by examining the conditions under
which music interventions have the largest eﬀ ects on both physiological and psychosocial dimen-
sions of coping and stress.
Methods
Inclusion criteria
For the current meta-analysis, multiple inclusion criteria were applied. Firstly, only RCTs that exam-
ined the e ﬀect of music interventions on the experience of stress and/or (state) anxiety were
included. Outcome measures related to quality of life (QoL) or pain were excluded, because theseoutcomes can be a response to stress, but are not measuring the primary stress-related outcomemeasures, upon which the present study is focused. The physiological eﬀ ects of stress had to be
measured by heart rate, blood pressure and hormone levels. Psychological eﬀ ects of stress had to
be measured by self-report instruments aiming at ‘stress ’or‘state anxiety ’. Secondly, studies includ-
ing participants younger than 18 years of age or examining people with dementia were excluded.
Although many studies reported cognitive and emotional bene ﬁts in dementia patients when they
were singing or when they were listening to familiar songs (Särkämö et al., 2008 ,2014 ), such
ﬁndings are not directly related to ‘stress reduction ’. Moreover, the regular stress measurement
instruments, which are also used in the included RCTs of the present study, are not used in
studies in which people with dementia are being examined.
Selection of studies
We conducted a computer-based search of the psychological and medical electronic literature data-
bases, including Medline, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wiley
Online Library, SpringerLink, PubMed, PiCarta, Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, PsychINFOand Google Scholar. Pelletier ’s meta-analysis ( 2004 ) can be seen as the starting point of current
meta-analysis because Pelletier also included all kinds of settings and patient groups. All RCTs avail-able until November 2017 that were in line with the inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. The electronic databases were searched using the following English search string:
(music*) AND (stress* OR anxiety* OR arousal) AND ( ‘randomized controlled trial ’OR‘randomised
controlled trial ’OR RCT). Furthermore, reference sections of review- and meta-analytic articles
about the e ﬀect of music interventions on stress-related outcomes were inspected for qualifying
studies. The initial search resulted in 2679 studies. Finally, 104 studies met all the inclusion criteria
(Figure 1 ). An overview of the included studies and their main characteristics are presented in
Table A1 (See Appendix 1 ).
Coding and moderators
The included studies were coded by the ﬁrst author using a coding sheet according to the guidelines
of Lipsey and Wilson ( 2001 ).Stress can be considered as the dependent variable and was coded into
physiological orpsychological stress-related outcomes, resulting in two meta-analyses. For each meta-
analysis, various factors with a potential moderating eﬀ ect on the relation between music interven-
tions and stress were identi ﬁed. These moderators were divided into outcome-, study-, sample-, and
intervention characteristics.
Regarding the stress-rel ated outcomes, three di ﬀerent physiological outcome measures were
coded: heart rate, blood pressure and hormone levels.T h e s ea r et h r e ed i ﬀerent biomarkers and
each biomarker must be measured diﬀ erently (Cacioppo et al., 2007;P f a ﬀet al., 2007 ). Regarding
the psychological stress-rela ted outcomes, it was coded whether the outcomes were assessed by298 M .D EW I T T EE TA L .
means of questionnaires measuring stress orstate anxiety. For measuring stress, the self-report
questionnaires Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1983) and the Visual Analogue Scale
Stress (VAS-S) are widely used and 19% of the included studies measuring psychological
stress-related outcomes have app lied them. State anxiety is measured in multiple studies by the
state version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anx iety Inventory (STAI-S; Spielberger, Gorsuch,
Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983 ), and is used in 59% of the included studies assessing psychologicalFigure 1. Flow chart of the search results.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 299
stress-related outcomes ( k= 76). Notably, despite the positive psychometric features of the STAI-S,
the measures have been criticised for their inabi lity to adequately discriminate between the symp-
toms of anxiety and depression (Caci, Bayle, Dossios, Robert, & Boyer, 2003; Grös, Antony, Simms, &
McCabe, 2007).
We coded whether the study quality was strong, moderate orweak with the ‘Quality Assessment
Tool for Quantitative Studies ’(Eﬀective Public Health Practice Project [EPHPP], 2009 ). This tool
assesses the quality of a study by providing a comprehensive and structured assessment of the
concept of study quality (Armijo-Olivo, Stiles, Hagen, Biondo, & Cummings, 2012 ). The EPHPP has
been reported to have content and construct validity (Jackson & Waters, 2005 ; Thomas, Ciliska,
Dobbins, & Micucci, 2004 ). Low-quality studies negatively a ﬀect the internal (causal conclusion) val-
idity, which can lead to a biased estimation of the overall eﬀ ect estimate (Higgins & Green, 2011 ; Zeng
et al., 2015 ). Regarding the setting in which the study was conducted, we coded whether the study
was conducted in a polyclinic medical setting ,pre-, during or after medical surgery , or whether it was a
so-called nonmedical setting (e.g., work-related settings, research among students at universities or
musical activities to improve health in chronical patients). Further, we coded whether the study
was conducted in a Western country (European countries, Australia, USA, Canada, New Zealand) or
in a non-Western country (mainly Asiatic countries). The cultural environment has been shown to
inﬂuence the way people respond to and cope with stress (Lonner, 2007 ; Tweed, White, &
Lehman, 2004 ), which could inﬂuence the e ﬀect of music on stress. The type of control condition
was coded as care as usual (CAU) or another intervention. Di ﬀerent control conditions can lead to
diﬀerent e ﬀect sizes and recognising this is crucial for drawing accurate conclusions about treatment
eﬃcacy (Finney, 2000 ; Karlsson & Bergmark, 2015 ).
Several sample characteristics were also code d, such as the percentage of men in each study.
There are indications men and women tend to react di ﬀerently to stress, both psychologically
and physiologically, leading to substantiated gender di ﬀerences in measured stress levels (Galana-
kis, Stalikas, Kallia, Karagianni, & Karela, 2009; Kajantie & Phillips, 2006 ;V e r m a ,B a l h a r a ,&G u p t a ,
2011). We also coded the average age of the samples per study because research on occupational
stress shows the existence of several signi ﬁcant diﬀe rences in stress levels between diﬀ erent ages
(Galanakis et al., 2009 ).
Finally, we coded six music intervention characteristics. First, according to Bradt and Dileo ( 2014 ),
we coded whether the music intervention was o ﬀered in the context of music therapy by a trained
music therapist, or whether the music intervention was o ﬀered by a healthcare professional, the
researcher, or by the patient himself, as a music activity (Dileo, 2006 ; Dileo & Bradt, 2007 ; Kamioka
et al., 2014 ; Leubner & Hinterberger, 2017 ). Second, we coded whether the music intervention
involved live music orprerecorded music, because di ﬀerences in e ﬀects on stress-related outcomes
were found (e.g., Arnon et al., 2006 ; Bailey, 1983 ; Baker, 2001 ). Third, regarding the selection of
music, it was coded whether the music was self-selected by the participants and based on own pre-
ference (bringing their own music) or whether the music was pre-selected by the researcher or the
(music) therapist. Some researchers have advised to allow participants choose the music themselves,
because this may have a greater stress reducing impact ( Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, Barradas, & Silva,
2008 ), but this does not always mean that participants could bring their own music. On the other
hand, the pre-selected music (by the researchers) is mostly based on the musical characteristics
related to classical and soothing music, which are assumed to positively a ﬀect relaxation and
stress reduction (Burns et al., 2002 ; Labbé, Schmidt, Babin, & Pharr, 2007 ). Fourth, we coded
whether the music intervention concerned the music tempo of 60 –80 bpm, or whether no speci ﬁc
music tempo was mentioned in the study. Fifth, it was coded whether the music contained lyrics
or whether the music was purely instrumental. Lastly, we coded the number of music interventionsessions. The number of interventions is positively correlated to improvements in many outcomes
including the regulation of stress and anxiety (Cassileth, Vickers, & Magill, 2003 ; Gold, Solli, Krüger,
& Lie, 2009 ; Robb, Carpenter, & Burns, 2011 ).300 M .D EW I T T EE TA L .
Calculation and analyses
Data analysis was performed by the ﬁrst and second author. The eﬀ ect sizes were transformed into
Cohen ’sdby use of Wilson ’s(2013 ) calculator and Lipsey and Wilson ’s(2001 ) formulae. Negative
eﬀect sizes indicate that music interventions had a negative eﬀ ect on stress-related outcomes.
Most d-values were calculated based on reported means and standard deviations. To correct for pre-
treatment di ﬀerences, pretest e ﬀects were subtracted from posttest e ﬀects. The e ﬀect size was coded
as zero when a study mentioned that an e ﬀect was not signi ﬁcant without providing any statistics
(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ). For both meta-analyses, the continuous moderators (age of the participants,
gender of the participants, duration of the music intervention and frequency of the music interven-
tion) were centred on their means. For categorical variables, dichotomous dummy variables werecreated. Extreme outliers in e ﬀect sizes were identi ﬁed using box plots (Tabachnik & Fidell, 2013 ),
and were winsorized (i.e., replaced by the highest or lowest acceptable score falling within thenormal range) for both meta-analyses. Standard errors were estimated using Lipsey and Wilson ’s
(2001 ) formulae.
In almost all the studies it was possible to calculate more than one eﬀ ect size as most studies
reported on multiple stress-related outcome variables, multiple scales or measurement instruments.It is possible that the e ﬀect sizes from the same study are more alike than e ﬀect sizes from other
studies. The assumption of independent eﬀ ect sizes underlying traditional meta-analytic methods
was therefore violated (Hox, 2010 ; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ). In line with recently conducted meta-ana-
lyses, we applied a multilevel approach in both meta-analyses in order to deal with the interdepen-
dency of e ﬀect sizes (Assink et al., 2015 ; Cheung, 2014 ; Houben, Van Den Noortgate, & Kuppens, 2015 ;
Spruit, Assink, van Vugt, van der Put, & Stams, 2016 ; ter Beek et al., 2018 ).
A three-level meta-analytic model was used to calculate the combined e ﬀect sizes and to
perform the moderator analyses. Three sources of variance were modelled, including the sampling
variance for each e ﬀect sizes (level-one), the variance between eﬀ ect sizes within studies (level-
two), and the variance between studies (level-three) (Assink & Wibbelink, 2016). The meta-analysis
was
conducted in R (version 3.4.3) with the metafor package, employing a multilevel random
eﬀects model (Houben et al., 2015; Van den Bussche, Van den Noortgate, & Reynvoet, 2009 ;V i e c h t -
bauer, 2010 ). This model is adequate and often used for multilevel meta-analyses and is, in general,
superior to the ﬁxed-e ﬀects approaches used in traditional meta-analyses (Van Den Noortgate &
Onghena, 2003). We used likelihood ratio tests to compare the deviance scores of the full model
and the models without variance parameters on level two or three to determine if the level-twoand -three variances were signi ﬁcant, indicating heterogeneity of e ﬀect sizes. A heterogeneous
eﬀect size distribution indicates that the e ﬀect sizes cannot be treated as estimates of a
common overall e ﬀect size. In that case, we conducted moderator analyses, because the di ﬀerences
among e ﬀect sizes may be explained by outcome, study, sample, and/or intervention
characteristics.
Publication bias
A common problem in conducting a meta-analysis is that studies with nonsigni ﬁcant or nega-
tive results are less likely to be published than studies with positive and signi ﬁcant results. The
studies included in this meta-analysis may therefore not be an adequate representation of all
studies that have been conducted. This phenomenon is called the ‘ﬁle drawer problem ’
(Rosenthal, 1995).
In order to check the presence of publication bias in the current meta-analysis, a trim and ﬁll pro-
cedure was performed (Duval & Tweedie, 2000a ,2000b ) by testing the asymmetry of the funnel plot
according to Egger ’s method (Egger, Davey Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997 ). In case of publication
bias, the funnel plot of the distribution of eﬀ ect sizes is asymmetric, resulting in a signiﬁ cant Egger’s
test. If Egger ’s method indicates publication bias, a trim and ﬁll procedure is required. We tested ifHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 301
eﬀect sizes were missing on the left side of the distribution, since publication bias would only be likely
to occur in the case of nonsigni ﬁcant or unfavourable (i.e., negative) results. In case of left-sided
funnel plot asymmetry, we imputed estimations of eﬀ ect sizes of missing studies through trim and
ﬁll analyses, and subsequently computed an overall e ﬀect size that would take the inﬂ uence of pub-
lication bias into account (Duval & Tweedie, 2000b ), providing an estimate of the degree to which
publication bias might have a ﬀected the overall mean e ﬀect size.
Results
This meta-analytic review included 104 RCTs (all non-overlapping samples) with a total of N= 9.617
participants of whom n= 4.838 participated in a music intervention group or music therapy group,
and n= 4.779 constituting the comparison group. Table A1 shows an overview of the most important
characteristics of the included studies (see Appendix 1 ).Table 1 shows the overall e ﬀects of music
interventions on both physiological stress-related outcomes and psychological stress-related
outcomes.
Eﬀect of music interventions on physiological stress-related outcomes
The meta-analysis on the e ﬀect of music interventions on physiological stress-related outcomes con-
tained 61 independent studies ( s), from which 197 e ﬀect sizes ( k) were denied, and a total sample of
N= 3.188 participants, of which n=1.624 participants in the music intervention groups, and n=1.564
participants in the comparison groups.
Overall e ﬀect on physiological stress-related outcomes
As i g n i ﬁcant small-to-medium e ﬀect ( d= 0.380, p≤.001) of music interventions on physiological
stress-related outcomes (heart rate, blood pressu re, stress-related hormones) was found, indicat-
ing that music interventions reduced physiological stress symptoms. According to the trim-and-
ﬁll plot, the presence of publication bias was unlikely, as there were no imputed e ﬀect sizes on the
left side of the funnel (see Figure A1 ,Appendix 2 ). The likelihood ratio test showed that signi ﬁcant
variance was present at the between-study level ( level 3) and the within studies level (level 2). In
cases of heterogeneous e ﬀect size distributions, moderator analyses are advised to assess
whether the variance between the e ﬀect sizes can be explained by moderators. Therefore, we

Outcome characteristics. We found a signi ﬁcant moderating eﬀ ect ( p≤.05) on the di ﬀerent types of
physiological stress-related outcomes (heart rate, blood pressure or stress-related hormones). The
strongest e ﬀects of music interventions on the physiological stress-related outcomes were measured
by heart rate ( d= 0.456 )compared to blood pressure ( d=0.343) and hormone levels ( d= 0.349).
Study characteristics. No signi ﬁcant moderating e ﬀects of study characteristics were found. More
speciﬁcally, the type of setting (nonmedical settings, pre- or postmedical surgery or during
medical procedures), the continent where the study was conducted (Western or non-Westerncountries), and the quality of the study (weak, moderate or strong) showed no signi ﬁcant moderating
eﬀects. The continent where the study had been carried out showed a trend ( p= 0.089), indicatingTable 2. Moderator e ﬀects of music interventions on physiological stress-related outcomes.

that non-Western studies yielded larger eﬀ ects on physiological stress-related outcomes than studies
conducted in Western countries.
Sample characteristics. The age and gender of the samples did not have a moderating eﬀ ect on the
physiological stress symptoms.
Intervention characteristics. No signi ﬁcant moderating e ﬀect was found in the type of intervention
(music therapy or music intervention), type of control condition (CAU or another intervention), music
induction (prerecorded music or live music), music style (predetermined relaxing music or patient
preferred music), music tempo (60 –80 bpm or another tempo), or the use of music with lyrics in con-
trast to the use of purely instrumental music.
Eﬀect of music interventions on psychological stress-related outcomes
The meta-analysis on the e ﬀect of music interventions on physiological stress-related outcomes con-
tained 79 independent studies ( s), from which 130 e ﬀect sizes ( k) were denied, and a total sample of
N= 6.800 participants, of which n=3.373 participants in the music intervention groups and n=3.427
participants in the comparison groups.
Overall e ﬀect on psychological stress-related outcomes
A signiﬁ cant medium-to-large e ﬀect ( d=0.545, p≤.001) of music interventions on psychological
stress-related outcomes was found, indicating that music interventions reduced psychological
stress-related symptoms (state anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, and feelings of worry). The trim-and-ﬁll plot did not show lack of e ﬀect sizes on the left side of the funnel (see Figure A2 ,Appendix
2), therefore publication bias was unlikely. The likelihood ratio test showed that signi ﬁcant variance
was present at the between (level 3) and within (level 2) study level. Moderator analyses on type ofoutcome, study, sample, and music intervention characteristics were conducted to examine the eﬀ ect
of music intervention on psychological stress-related outcomes.
Results of moderator analyses on psychological stress-related outcomes
The moderator analyses of the psychological stress-related outcomes were justi ﬁed by signiﬁ cant
overall heterogeneity for all moderator variables, including the variables with missing values. Theresults of these moderator analyses are presented in Table 3 .
Outcome characteristic. The type of psychological outcome (stress- or state anxiety) did not mod-
erate the e ﬀect of music interventions on psychological stress-related outcomes.
Study characteristics. No signi ﬁcant moderating e ﬀects were found in the study characteristics.
More speci ﬁcally, the continent where the study was conducted, type of setting, and quality of the
study, did not moderate the e ﬀect of the music intervention on physiological stress-related
outcomes.
Sample characteristics. No moderating e ﬀects of the age and gender composition of the samples
were found.
Intervention characteristics. We found no signi ﬁcant moderating e ﬀects of the intervention charac-
teristics, which included the type of intervention (music therapy or music intervention), music induc-tion (prerecorded music or live music), music style (predetermined relaxing music or self-selected
music by the patient), and the use of music with lyrics in contrast to the use of purely instrumental
music. The music tempo showed a trend ( p= .064), indicating that music with 60 –80 bpm yielded
larger e ﬀects than music with another or unspeci ﬁed tempo. Another trend concerned the type of304 M .D EW I T T EE TA L .
control condition ( p= .097). If a non-established intervention aimed at stress reduction was used as a
control condition, e ﬀects were somewhat larger than if the control condition concerned CAU (i.e.,
regular medical care). Finally, the number of interventions showed a trend ( p= .078) indicating
that one single session generated larger e ﬀects than two or more sessions.
Discussion

Furthermore, the study aimed to examine which outcome, study, sample or intervention character-
istics moderated the strength of the eﬀ ect on physiological and psychological stress-related out-
comes. Overall, we found a signiﬁ cant small-to-medium e ﬀect of music interventions on
physiological stress-related outcomes ( d= .380) and a medium e ﬀect of music interventions on
psychological stress-related outcomes ( d=.545), indicating that music intervention groups
beneﬁted more than the comparison groups. We conclude that music interventions are eﬀ ective
in reducing physiological and psychological stress-related symptoms in di ﬀerent kinds of settings
(mental healthcare, polyclinic medical settings, during medical surgery and in daily life situations).There were no indications of publication bias.
The overall ﬁndings of the current study are consistent with ﬁndings of previous meta-analyses
(Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Bradt et al., 2013a ; Bradt et al., 2013b ; Bradt et al., 2011 ; Gillen et al., 2008 ;
Kim, Evangelista, & Park, 2015 ; Pelletier, 2004 ; Rudin et al., 2007 ). There is a growing body of evidence
that music interventions yield positive, moderate eﬀ ects on stress reduction. Considering the
demands of today ’s society, the need for stress reduction interventions are large. Millions of
people around the world use tranquilising medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants and benzo-
diazepines, to cope with life stressors or anxiety (e.g., Bandelow et al., 2015 ; Olfson et al., 2015 ; Puetz
et al., 2015 ). Not only do these types of medication have considerable negative side eﬀ ects, including
substance dependence and abuse, research also indicates that the eﬀ ects of pharmacological treat-
ment on stress-related problems are not much larger than the eﬀ ects of music interventions found in
the current meta-analytic study (Olfson et al., 2015 ). Besides, a common argument for starting
pharmacological treatment instead of psychological treatment for stress reduction is that itseﬀects occur immediately or faster (Bandelow et al., 2015 ; Fedoro ﬀ& Taylor, 2001 ). However, the
results of this meta-analysis were based on mainly short-term music interventions, most of the
time on a single occasion, having a direct stress reducing eﬀ ect in various contexts. The current
study therefore indicates the relevance of brief music interventions for stress reduction in all kindsof settings. Also, our search revealed that the eﬀ ects of long-term music interventions have been
seldom examined.
Psychological e ﬀects of music
Results of our meta-analysis show a medium e ﬀect of music interventions on psychological stress-
related outcomes, including emotional states of subjective worry, state anxiety, restlessness and ner-vousness. Music not only reduces physiological arousal , but also a ﬀects emotional states. This may be
attributed to the e ﬀect of music on brain areas, such as the amygdala, which are responsible for
emotional processes. A related explanation for the positive eﬀ ects of music interventions on psycho-
logical stress-related outcomes concerns the positive inﬂ uence of listening to pleasant music on
emotional valence, which can be explained by the degree of attraction that an individual feelstowards a speci ﬁc object or event (Jäncke, 2008 ; Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008 ). Music experienced as plea-
sant increases the intensity of emotional valence (the felt happiness), which has a stress-reducing
eﬀect (Jiang, Rickson, & Jiang, 2016 ; Rohner & Miller, 1980 ; Sandstrom & Russo, 2010 ; Witvliet &
Vrana, 2007 ). An increased dopamine activity in the mesolimbic reward brain system has been
shown to be associated with these feelings of happiness in response to high-valence music (e.g.,Blood & Zatorre, 2001 ; Salimpoor et al., 2013 ; Salimpoor, Benovoy, Larcher, Dagher, & Zatorre,
2011 ; Zatorre, 2015 ).
Another explanation for the positive e ﬀect of music interventions on psychological stress-related
outcomes may be that listening to music can provide ‘distraction ’from stress-increasing thoughts or
feelings (Bernatzky, Presch, Anderson, & Panksepp, 2011 ; Chanda & Levitin, 2013 ). Indeed, the ben-
eﬁcial property of music to distract people from aversive states has been supported by short-term
music interventions for acute stress reduction (Fancourt, Ockelford, & Belai, 2014 ; Linnemann et al.,
2015 ). These ﬁndings are therefore in line with the current meta-analysis, which primarily included
studies involving short-term music interventions.306 M .D EW I T T EE TA L .
Music listening in the presence of others may strengthen the stress-reducing eﬀ ect of the music
intervention, which is believed to be caused by increased emotional well-being (Juslin et al., 2008 ),
and increased feelings of social cohesion (Boer & Abubakar, 2014 ; Linnemann, Strahler, & Nater,
2016 ; Pearce, Launay, & Dunbar, 2015 ). There is also empirical evidence showing that people synchro-
nise in movement (auditory-motor synchronisation) with each other when engaging in music therapy
group interventions, which evokes positive feelings of togetherness and bonding, and decreases
stress levels (Linnemann et al., 2016 ; Tarr, Launay, & Dunbar, 2014 ). Group music-making or
singing together may result in social bonding, which may be explained by the release of the neuro-
transmitters endorphin and oxytocin (e.g., Dunbar, Kaskatis, MacDonald, & Barra, 2012 ; Freeman, 2000 ;
Tarr et al., 2014 ; Weinstein, Launay, Pearce, Dunbar, & Stewart, 2016 ). These neurotransmitters play a
role in the defensive response to stress (Amir, Brown, & Amit, 1980 ; Dief, Sivukhina, & Jirikowski, 2018 ;
Myint, Jayakumar, Hoe, Kanthimathi, & Lam, 2017 ). It should be noted that nearly all studies included
in our meta-analysis examined participants listening to music alone (e.g., by using headphones),because most studies examined ‘music as medicine ’instead of music therapy, which is applied by
a music therapist, and can be delivered both in a group and individual format.
Eﬀect moderating variables
Results indicate that moderating variables may explain di ﬀerences in the strength of the e ﬀect sizes.
Signiﬁcant stronger moderating e ﬀects were found in studies in which physiological arousal, as a
result of stress, was measured by heart rate, compared to studies in which physiological arousal
was measured by blood pressure or stress-related hormone levels. These results are consistent
with the large body of knowledge concerning the immediate eﬀ ects of psychological stress on the
sympathetic responses in the autonomic nervous system, meaning increases of heart rate and
decreases of heart rate variability (Chandola, Heraclides, & Kumari, 2010 ; Föhr et al., 2017 ). The
results are also in line with the assumption that music with a slow steady rhythm provides stress
reduction by altering inherent body rhythms, such as heart rate (Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014 ; Thaut,
Kenyon, Schauer, & McIntosh, 1999 ).
None of the other possible moderators of interventions eﬀ ects proved to be signi ﬁcant, but results
showed some noteworthy trends of the intervention characteristics. First, the music tempo seemed to
inﬂuence the strength of the e ﬀect of music interventions on the psychological stress-related out-
comes. Larger e ﬀect sizes were found in music with a tempo of 60– 80 bpm, where tempo represents
slow and soothing music. This corresponds with previous research, which suggests that music with a
slow tempo can be considered to be one of the most signi ﬁcant determinants of audio-related e ﬀects
on stress reduction (Bernardi et al., 2006 ; Björkman, Karlsson, Lundberg, & Frisman, 2013 ; Iwanaga,
Kobayashi, & Kawasaki, 2005 ; Jiang et al., 2016 ; Nilsson, 2008 ; ). Second, the frequency of the
music intervention sessions did moderate the eﬀ ect of music interventions on the psychological
stress-related outcomes, indicating that only one session is needed for achieving eﬀ ects on stress
reduction. This is in line with previous research, which implies that music has an immediate positiveeﬀect on stress reduction (e.g., Koelsch, 2015 ; Zatorre, 2015 ). However, Leubner and Hinterberger’ s
(2017 ) review of the e ﬀectiveness of music interventions on depression showed that more than
one session yielded larger e ﬀects (at least, within the ﬁrst 6 weeks of treatment).
Contrary to our expectations, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁ cant moderating e ﬀect of some intervention
characteristics. Firstly, type of intervention did not moderate the eﬀ ects on physiological stress-
related outcomes. Studies in which music therapy is oﬀered (by a trained therapist) did not yield
signi 
ﬁcantly larger e ﬀect sizes than studies in which music interventions were o ﬀered as so-called
purposeful music activities (by the researcher, healthcare professionals or self-administered by the
patient) .However, Dileo ( 2006 ) stated that music therapy is more eﬀ ective than ‘music as medicine ’
interventions and attributed this di ﬀerence to the fact that music therapists individualise their inter-
ventions to meet patients ’speciﬁc needs (Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Dileo, 1999 ,2006 ). A possible expla-
nation for di ﬀerent ﬁndings of Dileo ’s review ( 2006 ) compared to the current meta-analytic reviewHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 307
is that, in the past 14 years, the number of RCTs examining the e ﬀects of ‘music as medicine ’inter-
ventions has grown substantially, and with that, both the associated research methods and interven-
tion protocols were improved. However, experimental research on the eﬀ ects of music therapy is still
in its infancy, while considerable diversity is evident in the interventions that have been examined sofar. Secondly, results show that the way the music was selected did not inﬂ uence the e ﬀect of music
interventions on stress-related outcomes, while many previous studies report that self-selected music
is the most e ﬀective in terms of stress reduction (e.g., Jiang et al., 2016 ; Jiang, Zhou, Rickson, & Jiang,
2013 ; Juslin et al., 2008 ). A possible explanation is that the term ‘self-selected music ’is used di ﬀerently
in studies included in this meta-analytic review. The term ‘self-selected music ’was both used when
the patient brings their own favourite music and when the patient could choose the music from a
pre-selected list of musical styles (e.g., Bradt & Dileo, 2014 ; Cepeda, Carr, Lau, & Alvarez, 2006 ;
Helsing, Västfjäll, Bjälkebring, Juslin, & Hartig, 2016 ; Lee, Chung, Chan, & Chan, 2005 ; Nilsson,
2008 ). Notably, where self-selected music also means that patients have to choose their music
from a preselected list, the researcher can preselect only music with speci ﬁc characteristics (nonlyrical
music with a tempo of 60– 80 bpm and a sound intensity level of 60 dB) which contributes to a stron-
ger eﬀect on physiological stress-related outcomes (Bernardi et al., 2006 ; Björkman et al., 2013 ; Dileo,
2007; Gan, Lim, & Haw, 2016 ; Good et al., 2000 ). Besides, previous research shows that listening to
soothing music, pre-selected by the researcher, lowers the stress-levels signi ﬁcantly in contrast to
energetic up-tempo music (Iwanaga et al., 2005 ; Jiang et al., 2013 ; Sandstrom & Russo, 2010 ). This
diﬀers from the ﬁndings of many studies, which attribute these positive eﬀ ects to the ability of par-
ticipants to self-select music (Juslin et al., 2008 ). However, this often means that the participants can
choose one of the researcher ’s pre-selected playlists instead of actually bringing their own music.
Because of the uncertainty about what the e ﬀect actually causes, in the present study we coded
‘own preference ’when patients could bring their own music, and ‘selecti on
 by researcher/therapist ’
when patients had to choose the music what was pre-selected by the researcher or therapist.
Results showed no moderating e ﬀect for the settings in which the music intervention was con-
ducted (nonmedical, surgery, polyclinic procedures), which might indicate that the e ﬀects of music
interventions do not depend on the type of setting. This is in line with the assumption that stress is
a general activation response to any stimulus that could mean both a threat and a challenge, result-ing in heightened arousal of the autonomic nervous system (Pfa ﬀet al., 2007;S e l y e ,1976 ,1973).
Also, neurological evidence provides insight in to the positive e ﬀects of music on the stress
response with respect to arousal regulation, and these e ﬀects appear to be independent of
context or setting (e.g., Casey, 2017; Koelsch, 2015 ;K o e l s c he ta l . , 2016; Linnemann et al., 2015;
Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014).
Limitations of the present study
The current study has some limitations that need to be mentioned. Firstly, we operationalised theconcept of stress in terms of physiological and psychological outcomes, which resulted in two
meta-analyses. Because the moderator analyses were performed on both psychological and physio-
logical data, the impression can be that it concerns two independent outcomes, while the outcomesalways a ﬀect and strengthen each other during stress. This is because the underlying systems of the
physiological and psychological responses are both, and mostly at the same time, responsible for theexperience of stress (e.g., Linnemann et al., 2017 ; McEwen & Gianaros, 2010 ). Secondly, some cat-
egories of relevant variables included in the moderator analyses contained only a few eﬀ ect sizes,
which reduces statistical power and sets limits to the generalizability of the study ﬁndings. This
especially may be the case for the moderators music induction (prerecorded music vs. live music)
and music style (relaxation vs. own choice) in the meta-analysis of the physiological stress-related out-
comes and the moderators music tempo (60–80 bpm vs. another tempo), and the frequency of the
intervention (a single session vs. more than one session) in the meta-analysis of the psychologicalstress-related outcomes.308 M .D EW I T T EE TA L .
Implications for research and practice
Despite the limitations, this study has important implications for future research and the practical use
of music interventions in stress reduction. First and foremost, this meta-analytic study indicates that
music interventions can be e ﬀective in the reduction of stress. Many people suﬀ er from stress-related
symptoms, both in their daily lives and in speci ﬁc settings (e.g., medical settings, mental health care
settings, work-related settings). Considering the fact that music interventions are very easy and inex-
pensive to integrate in both daily lives and in medical settings, it is important to recognise the eﬀectsof music interventions. Another implication is that future research should focus on the speci ﬁc
characteristics of the music intervention on stress reduction, for example, the music tempo, thestyle of the music, the use of live music or prerecorded music, the way the music is selected, orthe frequency of the music intervention sessions.
The vast body of neurological evidence regarding the inﬂ uence of music on arousal, stress and
emotional processes is still growing, but the speci ﬁc practical implications have not yet been
suﬃciently investigated. In included RCTs, music interventions are still considered like one and the
same, while the speci ﬁc characteristics of music show di ﬀerent e ﬀects, such as the music tempo
(60–80 bpm). To identify the most eﬀ ective music intervention for stress reduction, it is important
that the possible moderators of the music interventions be better tested. Therefore, it is rec-
ommended for future trials to describe all aspects of the music intervention, with both the speci ﬁc
characteristics involved in these two meta-analyses as well as the musical characteristics, such as
timbre, melodic and harmonic aspects, and rhythmic accentuation. These characteristics were not
reported in the included RCTs, but can nonetheless moderate the eﬀ ects of music interventions
on stress reduction (e.g., Leubner & Hinterberger, 2017 ; Moore, 2013 ; Thaut & Hoemberg, 2014 ).
There are many RCTs examining the e ﬀect of music as medicine interventions , but there is de ﬁnitely
a lack of RCTs examining the e ﬀect of music therapy interventions on stress-related outcomes, and it is
therefore impossible to establish at this time whether these interventions are more eﬀ ective than the
‘music as medicine ’interventions. Although the use of prerecorded music may be preferred by
researchers as a standardised stimulus, it is recommended to also develop speci ﬁcmusic therapy pro-
tocols that will adhere to the research standards of RCTs.
The relationship between the frequency/duration of the music intervention and the eﬀ ects on
stress reduction is unclear. Future research should examine this topic, because apart from the
musical characteristics, such as the music style and music tempo, these general characteristics ofthe music intervention may also moderate the e ﬀects on stress reduction. It seems that the
inﬂuence of the music selection method on the eﬀ ects of the music intervention is interpreted
diﬀerently. In new trials, we strongly recommend reporting clearly if the researcher/therapist did
choose the music of the intervention, or if the participants had to choose one of the researchers ’
or therapists ’pre-selected music playlists, or if the participants brought their own music. Finally,
it is recommended to compare the e ﬀects of music (therapy) interventions on stress-related out-
comes
with pharmacological treatment, but also with other experiential interventions, such as
yoga or mindfulness.
Summary
The current meta-analytic review provides high-level evidence that music interventions can beeﬀective in reducing stress and provides justi ﬁcation for the increasing use of music interventions
for stress reduction in both medical and mental health care practice. Considering the low costsand lack of side eﬀ ects of music interventions, the moderate tranquilising eﬀ ects of music are very
signiﬁ cant for the prevention and treatment of stress-related problems. However, the development
of music (therapy) intervention protocols are necessary to set up more robust research into theeﬀects of music interventions, and to gain more insight into the eﬀ ect moderating characteristics
of music intervention for stress reduction.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 309
