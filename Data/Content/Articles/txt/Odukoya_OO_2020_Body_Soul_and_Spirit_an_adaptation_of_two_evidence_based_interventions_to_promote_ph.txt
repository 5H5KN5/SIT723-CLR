Abstract
Background: Physical inactivity and unhealthy eating are two leading behavioral risk factors contributing to
preventable non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Evidence-based interventions (EBI) using community-engaged
approaches to address these risks abound in high-income countries. Comparatively, evidence of such interventions
is sparse in low- and middle-income countries, where NCD mortality is greater. This paper describes the protocol
for the development of the cultural adaptation and pilot testing of a combination of two EBI (i.e., Body and Soul
and the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit), in church-based settings in Lagos, Nigeria. In addition, we describe the
development of the inclusion of an additional component, i.e., faith-based text messages, into one of the treatment
arms. Our objective is to assess the feasibility of developing and implementing the adapted interventions with the
ultimate aim of developing a fully powered trial.

Methods: This pilot study will assess the design and implementation of a three-arm cluster-randomized pilot trial in
12 randomly selected Anglican churches (4 in each arm). First, we will design a cultural adaptation of the two EBI ’s
to form a multifaceted combined intervention known as the Body Soul and Spirit . The second treatment arm, i.e.,
Body Soul and Spirit Plus , will retain all the components of Body Soul and Spirit with the inclusion of faith-based text
messages using mobile phones. Participants in the control arm will receive information leaflets designed to increase
physical activity and healthy food consumption. The outcome measures include participant recruitment and
retention, program participation and satisfaction, and data collection completion rates. The outcomes for the
proposed definitive trial will be the number of servings of fruit and vegetables and minutes of moderate to
vigorous physical activity per day will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6-month follow-up. Implementation outcomes
will be assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods.
Discussion: The study will enhance the understanding of how best to design and implement behavioral
interventions in church-based settings using community-based participatory approaches. It will also inform the
development of a definitive randomized controlled trial.

Background
Globally, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity are im-
portant risks for non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes,
and certain cancers [ 1]. Up to 2.7 million deaths are attrib-
utable to diets low in fruits and vegetables. Worldwide,
low intake of fruits and vegetables is estimated to cause
about 19% of gastrointestinal cancer, about 31% of coron-
ary heart disease, and 11% of stroke [ 1]. Almost two mil-
lion deaths (1.9 million) are attributable to physical
inactivity. Physical inactivity and unhealthy diets are major
contributors to high body mass indices, which ranks as a
leading risk of death globally [ 1,2].
In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
the prevalence of these risk factors is rising, particularly
among adults in urban areas [ 3,4]. Several African coun-
tries are undergoing rapid urbanization and an epidemio-
logical transition with increased rates of NCDs,
particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, can-
cers, and obesity [ 5–8]. In Nigeria, almost one in five
deaths is attributable to NCDs, and this rate is increasing
[9]. National surveys indicate that the rate of overweight/
obesity among women increased from 22% in 2008 to 25%
in 2013 with the highest prevalence (44%) occurring in
Lagos, the most populous city in Africa [ 10].
Although several evidence-based interventions (EBI)
that address known NCD risk factors exist, they are
often generated in high-income countries (HIC) and are
not frequently deployed in low- and middle-income
countries where a significant burden of NCD mortality
and ill-health occur [ 11–13]. There is limited evidence
to demonstrate if or how EBI generated in HIC may
work in low- and middle-income country (LMIC)
settings with different religious, socio-economic, andcultural environments. Research that comprehensively
addresses effective ways of adapting evidence-based in-
terventions generated in HIC into local contexts can sig-
nificantly advance the field of NCD prevention and
result in significant improvements in population health
outcomes [ 14].
The vast majority of people in many sub-Saharan Afri-
can nations are deeply committed to the practices and
major tenets of either Christianity or Islam, which are the
world ’s two largest religions. Almost all (> 95%) Nigerians
identify with at least one of these two religions [ 10,15].
Religious environments play an important role in promot-
ing physical activity and healthy eating [ 16,17]. Not only
are they potential points of contact among the populace,
they also tend to hold regular events that involve food, re-
lationships, and other activities. Churches, in particular,
present a potentially effective channel for delivering health
programs [ 18,19]. However, the majority of existing
church-based trials have been conducted in HIC like the
USA and among minority groups (e.g., African Americans
or Latinos), and few have targeted multiple risk behaviors.
Interventions targeting multiple behaviors simultaneously
have the potential to be efficient, cost-effective, and pro-
duce meaningful changes in population health [ 20,21].
Mobile phone use has increased tremendously in
Nigeria over the past 15 years. Nigeria ranks second, only
to South Africa, with the highest proportion of mobile
phone users in Africa [ 22,23]. In 2019, there were over
172 million mobile subscribers, accounting for an esti-
mated 87% of the population. This figure represented a
6.4% growth increase, compared to 162 million sub-
scribers in 2017 [ 24]. This provides a window of oppor-
tunity to develop mobile phone interventions to promote
physical activity (PA) and healthy food consumptionOdukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 2 of 15
(HFC) as has been done in some HICs. Previous studies in
HIC have used mobile phone interventions to promote
these behaviors. Of the potential approaches to mobile
phones interventions, text messages hold great promise,
because they can be tailored, are relatively low cost and
have the ability to reach a large proportion of people with-
out the need for an internet connection [ 25,26]. Although
evidence shows that text messages are effective for im-
proving PA and HFC in HIC [ 27–31], few interventions
have considered the use of faith-based text messages to
improve or sustain the effect of such interventions in
faith-based settings. Furthermore, none of these studies
have been conducted in a highly religious LMIC like
Nigeria.
The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of de-
veloping and implementing a cultural adaptation of the
effective components of two evidence-based interven-
tions in church settings, i.e., Body and Soul [ 32] and the
Healthy Body Healthy Spirit [ 33], to increase PA and
HFC in a church-based LMIC setting, with the ultimate
aim of developing a fully powered trial. We also aim to
assess the process of developing and implementing faith-
based text messages as a component of one of the treat-
ment arms.
Theoretical framework
As with the parent trials, we will be guided by the
socio-ecologic theoretical model (Fig. 1)[34], which
emphasizes the importance of the social environments
that shape human behavior and addresses the per-
sonal, institutional, and c ommunity factors affecting
them. The parent trials also emphasized the self-
determination theory of motivation [ 35], which sup-
ports the intrinsic human tendency to behave in effect-
ive healthy ways.
A key aspect of this study involves the active partici-
pation of the community (church) members in its de-
sign and implementation. This is more likely to create
sustainable interventions that promote community
health [ 36]. In addition, this approach incorporates
cultural norms and infuses community knowledge with
evidence-based socio-behavioral theory for theeffective implementation of complex health interven-
tions [ 36,37].
Study objectives
1. Gather information from the church leadership and
members and assess the process of using this
information to develop a culturally adapted
combined version of the two EBI and the additional
faith-based text message component.
2. Explore the acceptability of each of the adapted
components of the original interventions from the
perspectives of the church leadership and church
members and assess the feasibility of implementing
each intervention component.
3. Assess the feasibility of recruitment and retention
of the churches, church volunteers, and
participants, assess consent rates and procedures,
and gain estimates of recruitment and participation
rates for the adapted interventions
4. Determine the acceptability, feasibility, and
accuracy (and factors influencing this) of the data
collection methods and measures, assess data
completeness and explore data missingness at 3 and
6 months follow-up and its implications in develop-
ing a fully powered trial.
5. Assess the proportion of churches and study
participants completing the culturally adapted
intervention and explore factors that promote or
discourage engagement with and completion of the
intervention.
6. Estimate key parameters like the effect sizes, intra-
class correlation coefficients (ICC), and standard
deviations and compare these with the values ob-
tained in the literature to inform the calculation of
an adequate sample size for a fully powered defini-
tive trial.
Methods
Study setting
This study will be carried out in Lagos State, the commer-
cial capital and a largely urbanized part of Nigeria. It will
be conducted among churches in the diocese of Lagos

Mainland of the Anglican Communion, Church of
Nigeria. The diocese is headed by a bishop and has a total
of 53 churches. A vicar, assisted by church priests, is re-
sponsible for overseeing the administrative and religious
activities of each church. Each church has a governing
council consisting of elected members. Church services
are held primarily on Sundays with other religious activ-
ities occurring on other days of the week as needed. Each
church has a medical committee, consisting of volunteers
with interests in health-related matters. In addition, there
is a diocesan medical committee that oversees health-
related church activities of the entire diocese.
Trial design
This is a pilot of a three-arm cluster randomized con-
trolled trial and will be conducted in 12 (4 in each
group) of the 53 churches in the diocese of Lagos Main-
land of the Anglican Church of Nigeria. The twelve
churches will be randomized into three arms as follows:
A. Body Soul and Spirit (BSS)
B. Body Soul and Spirit Plus (BSS+)
C. Usual care/control (Control)
Participants
The study will be conducted among members of the par-
ticipating churches in the diocese.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To be eligible, participants must be adults aged 18 years
or older who have been members of the church for at
least 6 months and attend church services at least
weekly. Eligible respondents for BSS+ must, in addition,
have a text message-compatible mobile phone and have
used it for at least 6 months. Acutely ill or disabled
people will be excluded.
Description of the parent interventions
Body and Soul
This program [ 32] aimed at increasing fruit and vege-
table consumption among African American church
members living in California, Georgia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Delaware, and Virginia. The compo-
nents included the formation of a church coordination
committee, implementation of church-wide nutrition ac-
tivities to increase fruit and vegetable intake, provision
of educational materials, and motivational interviewing
phone calls delivered by trained peer counselors and a
policy change. A total of 15 churches were randomly
assigned to the Body and Soul intervention or to a com-
parison group. Fruit and vegetable (F&V) intakes were
measured at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Partici-
pants in the intervention group consumed significantly
more F&V than in the comparison group [ 32].Healthy Body/Healthy Spirit
This program [ 33] aimed at increasing physical activity
and fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption among Afri-
can American church members living in the greater At-
lanta area. Participants were provided with an exercise
videotape and guidebook; a nutrition videotape, cook-
book, and an audio cassette of gospel music. Sixteen
churches were randomly assigned to three intervention
conditions. Group 1 received culturally tailored self-help
nutrition and physical activity intervention materials.
Group 2 received the same intervention materials as
group 1, plus four motivational interviewing phone calls
delivered by trained peer counselors while group 3
served as the control group and received standard nutri-
tion and physical activity materials. Physical activity and
F&V consumption were measured at baseline and 1 year
after. Participants in the intervention groups consumed
significantly more F&V and exercised more minutes per
week than those in the control churches [ 33].
Description of the intervention arms
A. Body, Soul, and Spirit will be modeled after the two
EBIs conducted in African American churches in
the USA: the “Body and Soul ”and the “Healthy
Body Healthy Spirit ”[32,33]. The adapted
intervention, Body, Soul, and Spirit, will involve a
combination of the core components of both of the
parent interventions. In creating the aggregate
intervention, we will select components of each of
the parent trials that were deemed “essential ”[38,
39]. A component was termed “essential ”if it was
reported to have accounted for the positive
intervention effects observed in the parent trials
[40,41]. The following components of the parent
trials were considered essential and will be
considered for our adaptation and use (see Table 1):
a) Individual education
i. An adapted version of a cookbook [ 32] with healthy
eating recipes, cooking techniques, storage tips for
fruits and vegetables, and health benefits of
increasing fruit and vegetable intake.
ii. An adapted version of an exercise manual [ 33] and
exercise video or audio CD [ 33] containing gospel
music with biblical quotes/themes and/or brief
sound bites of priest sermons sliced between songs.
b) Group education
Each participating church will receive a single copy of
an adapted version of “Forgotten Miracles ”[32]a n1 8 -
min video that targets fruit and vegetable intake using
both spiritual and secular motivational messages.Odukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 4 of 15
Churches will be asked to organize public screenings of
the video and to make the copy available to members on
request.
c) Campaigns and promotions
i. Formation of a project coordination committee:
This committee will be composed of representatives
of the academic and church communities and will
be responsible for the implementation of the project
[32,33].
ii. Church events: There will be a project kick-off
event, at least one nutrition event and an additional
event involving the church priest [ 32]. Examples of
events included in the parent trials are serving fruit
and vegetables after church services, at other
church programs, or during the kick-off event;
sponsoring food demonstrations or taste tests; or-
ganizing tours of food markets and inviting guest
speakers; or having priest sermons related to health
(Table 1).
d) Supportive relationships
Motivational interviewing phone calls to selected
church parishioners delivered by trained church volun-
teers [ 32,33].
e) Policy change
Churches will agree to implement at least one policy
change [ 32]. Potential policy changes include establishingguidelines for the types of foods served at church func-
tions, changing snacks served at youth camps, or creating
af o o dp a n t r y .
B. Body Soul and Spirit Plus (Bss+) will retain all the
components of BSS with the addition of faith-based text
messages. We will develop the content, wording, fre-
quency, and timing of each message guided by the theor-
etical models mentioned above, a review of existing
literature and the feedback received from the parish-
ioners. We will then pre-test them among a small group
of parishioners before use to ensure that the messages
are designed to have the desired effect. The project co-
ordinator and/or trained church volunteers will send
these messages periodically at pre-scheduled intervals.
C. Usual care/Control: Information leaflets on healthy
food consumption and physical activity will be distrib-
uted to parishioners in the churches in this group after a
church service. This will constitute an information-
based standard of care approach that will be used as the
control condition for this group randomized trial (See
Fig.2).
Phases of the study
The study will be conducted in four phases.
Phase 1 —Pre-implementation —Community entry, re-
cruitment, and randomization of churches; partnership
and capacity building; and needs assessment and situ-
ation analysis.

Phase 2 —Intervention adaptation and development —
Adaptation and design of the core components of BSS
and BSS+ for use in a Nigerian setting.
Phase 3 —Intervention implementation and delivery
Phase 4 —Implementation evaluation —Data collection
and analysis of implementation measures, study out-
comes, and success criteria; calculation of an ICC, the
means and variances for each the three treatment
arms, effect sizes (all to potentially inform the sample
size calculation in a full RCT), and the decision to
determine whether or not to progress to a definitive
trial.Phase 1—pre-implementation
i)Community entry, church recruitment and
randomization: We will work with the leadership of
the diocese to recruit the 12 eligible churches from
their network of churches. To be included in the
study, churches must have at least 100 active mem-
bers (we define “active ”as members who attend
church services at least weekly). We will obtain a list
of the churches in the diocese and screen them for
eligibility. Then, we will randomly select 12 eligible
churches from this list. Selected churches will be allo-
cated into one of three groups: BSS, BSS+, or control.Fig. 2 Flow chart for participant enrolment, baseline data collection, follow-up, and analysisOdukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 6 of 15
Randomization will be computer-generated, with allo-
cation concealment by opaque sequentially numbered
sealed envelopes. An independent biostatistician will
generate the randomization sequence in accordance
with the CONSORT guidelines [ 42].
ii)Partnership development and Capacity building:
We will create a diocesan-project steering committee
(DPSC) consisting of one representative from the dio-
cesan leadership, one representative of the diocesan
medical society, two diocesan volunteers, and members
of the academic research team. The DPSC will serve as
the overall planning and coordination team for the inter-
vention. In addition, in each of the eight intervention
churches, we will create a local church implementing
committee (LCIC), which will consist of at least two
church members who are either volunteers and/or
persons nominated by the vicar and members of the aca-
demic research team. The LCIC will serve as the in-
house implementation team for the intervention.
Once the committees have been constituted, we will
conduct a partnership development and capacity build-
ing workshop for committee members to obtain leader-
ship and community buy-in. Workshops will initially
focus on sharing the project aims with participants to
obtain their support and commitment and to engage
them as partners on the project. The committees will
hold regular meetings where the academic researchers
will work with them to identify effective ways of imple-
menting the intervention. Thereafter, the committee
members will meet at regular intervals to discuss the de-
velopment, planning, and implementation of the project.
Committees will decide on operational procedures and
develop a plan to keep their church parishioners in-
volved in the intervention.
iii)Needs Assessment & Baseline Situation Analysis:
Qualitative methods will be used to: (i) Identify and
understand the underlying factors influencing PA and
eating patterns of the parishioners. (ii) Explore their
underlying cultural and spiritual values/norms and
how these affect PA and HFC. (iii) Explore their atti-
tudes towards the faith-based text messages and seek
their opinions on best ways to engage parishioners
using such messages. (iv) Understand how best to
adapt the core components of the program in their
local setting.
We will conduct nine in-depth interviews with the
bishop or his representative (1), church leaders/priests/
members of the church governing council (5), and mem-
bers of church medical societies (3). We will conduct
focus group discussions (FGDs) with the church mem-
bers. Participants will be stratified into three distinct
groups according to their ages, i.e., the elderly > 65 years,
adults 25 –64 years, youth aged 18 –24 years, or persons
who attend the youth section of the church. Focusgroups will consist of 6 –12 participants per group. All
interviews and FGDs will be conducted in the preferred
language and setting of the participants, audio-recorded,
and a research assistant will take notes during each dis-
cussion/interview.
Phase 2: intervention adaptation and
development —adaptation of the core components of BSS
and BSS+ for use in a Nigerian setting
Adaptation involves “reviewing and changing the struc-
ture of a program or practice to more appropriately fit
the needs and preferences of a particular group or com-
munity ”[43]. To culturally adapt the core components
of the project, we will go through the five stages of cul-
tural adaptation proposed by Barrera et al., i.e., informa-
tion gathering, preliminary design, preliminary testing,
refinement, and final trial [ 44].
Information gathering : First, we will gather information
to determine how well the original intervention will fit
the needs and preferences of our population, and if an
adaptation is in fact justified.
Preliminary design : We will use the information gained
from the first stage to inform the preliminary modifica-
tions of the original interventions while attempting to
preserve the core components. This will be done using
an iterative process in a series of focus group discussions
and feedback sessions with the church committee mem-
bers employing the same qualitative methods described
earlier. Thereafter, we will draft the preliminary version
of the intervention.
Preliminary testing, refinement, and final trial : This
study is the focus of the third and fourth stages where
we aim to pilot test the preliminary version and refine it
with the ultimate aim of proceeding to Barrera ’s fifth
stage of testing the interventions in a fully powered trial.
Framework for program adaptation and balancing
fidelity and fit Bernal et al. [ 45] proposed one of the
earliest models, the ecological validity model (EVM), for
cultural adaptation of evidence-based interventions. This
delineates eight dimensions, which we will consider
when developing the cultural adaptation of the program.
They are language, persons, metaphors, content, con-
cepts, goals, methods, and context [ 38]. Rodriguez et al.
[46] later expatiated on this to include three phases of
adaptation. In the initial phase, the research team will
collaborate with the members of the DPSC to find a bal-
ance between the needs of the church members and sci-
entific integrity. Then, we will jointly identify relevant
evaluation measures in the parent trials and adapt them
in a process parallel to the adaptation of the interven-
tion. The final phase will consist of jointly integrating
the observations and data gathered to design the newly
packaged intervention [ 46–48]. This process will alsoOdukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 7 of 15
follow the guide for balancing program fidelity and fit as
proposed by Castro et al. [ 49] during the program adap-
tation process.
In a series of workshops, the DPSC, guided by the core
components of the BSS and BSS+, the results of the needs
assessments, focus groups, feedback sessions, and the
models described above, will carry out the project adapta-
tion process. They will review the study protocol and
intervention materials, consider session-by-session ana-
lysis of each component and recommend possible modifi-
cations to ensure the spiritual and cultural acceptability to
the parishioners. Based on the recommendations of the
workshop participants, modified intervention materials
will be created. The end-result will form the initial draft of
the Body, Soul, and Spirit program.
Development of the faith-based text messages for
BSS+ The diocesan project steering committee and the
members of the academic team will jointly develop a
series of faith-based text messages designed to promote
PA and HFC for church members. We will design the
messages considering the World Health Organization
(WHO) recommendations for physical activity and
healthy eating and using the guidelines proposed by
Abroms et al. [ 50] for developing and pretesting text
messages for behavioral change, which are as follows:
a) Conduct formative research for insights into church
members ’health behaviors and opinions of faith-based
text messages to promote PA and F&V intake: In a series
of focus group sessions with the project committee and
church members, we will explore the opinions of the
church members about physical activity and fruit and
vegetable consumption, the possible barriers to these
health behaviors, and their opinions about receiving text
messages to help them overcome these barriers.
b) Design the text messages (TM): Then, we will iden-
tify our key behavioral change goals. Our objectives for
the TM component are to provide knowledge and/or fill
in identified knowledge gaps, modify attitudes, address
known barriers to change, and motivate people to take
action towards our key study outcomes. A key consider-
ation in designing the faith-based messages is to estab-
lish the link between biblical themes and our behavioral
change goals. Guided by our communication objectives,
theoretical models and using the insights garnered from
the focus groups and the literature, we will develop the
TM framework (i.e., frequency, timing, wording, lan-
guage) and form the faith-based TM library. This will be
done using an iterative process of feedback sessions with
the church committee members.
c) Pretesting and revising the text messages: We will
identify a small set of church members (less than 30) in
similar churches that are not part of our study. We will
pre-test these messages using the agreed TM framework,solicit the feedback from the participants on the word-
ing, content, and perceived effect of the messages.
Thereafter, we will make appropriate modifications till a
final version of the TM library and framework is agreed
upon. Then, we will adopt this for use as the +PLUS
component of the BSS +intervention arm.
Finally, based on the drafts developed for the BSS and
BSS+, the DPSC in another series of workshops, will de-
velop an action plan for the programs and present this
plan to the Bishop or his representative for his input
prior to adoption. These will serve as the action plans
for BSS and BSS+ programs.
Phase 3: intervention delivery/implementation
We will employ a three-arm group randomized pilot
study design using 12 churches (4 in each group). The
intervention will operate at two levels. The church-wide
events and environmental changes will be aimed at the
entire congregation, while the distribution of exercise/
nutrition videos, manuals and cookbook recipes, audio
CDs, and text messages will be delivered only to individ-
uals who voluntarily enroll and consent to participate in
the study. Data will be collected at baseline 3 and 6-
month time points.
Each participating church will identify 2 –3 volunteers
to serve as peer counselors for this project. They will
participate in the recruitment of study participants and
undergo peer-counselling training for the program. Vol-
unteers will have a background in a “health-related pro-
fession ”(e.g., physician, nurse, or other health worker)
and will be required to attend a training, make four
intervention calls to at least five members of each
church, and undergo a performance evaluation before
engagement. This training will provide knowledge and
general skills in patient recruitment, research ethics, and
motivational interviewing techniques like asking open-
ended questions, reflective listening, and specific strat-
egies to elicit discussions about PA and HFC. They will
be asked to recruit and make at least four intervention
calls to at least five study participants. Peer counselors
will receive a small stipend for their time and effort with
participant recruitment and retention and calling cards
to cover the cost of the phone calls. In addition, regard-
less of the treatment arm, churches (rather than partici-
pants) that achieve the minimum targets for participant
recruitment and retention will be provided with an in-
centive worth $100 or less at the end of the study.
Phase 4
Implementation evaluation —This will involve quantita-
tive and qualitative data collection and analysis of imple-

estimates for subsequent sample size calculations for the
future trial, evaluation of the program success criteria,
and a decision to determine whether or not to progress
to a definitive trial.
Outcome measures
The outcome measures for the pilot trial include the
following:
1. Recruitment measures: We will calculate the
number of participants who respond to the research
call and are screened for eligibility, number/
proportion of screened participants who meet the
criteria for eligibility, number/proportion of eligible
participants who provide consent and are enrolled
in the study, average time taken to enroll the
required number of study participants, and reasons
for any delays, reasons for non-consent, and pri-
mary reasons for non-eligibility.
2. Study implementation and fidelity measures are as
follows:
a.Individual and education: Number of church
members who request copies of the study materials.
Proportion of enrolled church members who
receive the cookbooks/exercise manuals/CDs, admit
to using them, how often they are used, the self-
rated usefulness of the materials in relation to study
outcomes, and reasons for non-use.
b.Church committees and group events : Number of
nominated committee members who consent to
participate in the church project committees,
number of consenting members who remain as
members throughout the study period, attendance
at church events, and rated usefulness of project
events in relation to trial outcomes.
c.Peer Counselors : Number of church members who
volunteer to serve as peer counselors, proportion of
potential peer counselors who attend the training,
proportion of trained MI counselors who satisfy the
post-training evaluation, and proportion of trained
peer counselors who remain in the program.
d.Church policy: We will assess the perception of the
selected church policies and perceived level of
policy compliance.
e.Faith based text messages : We will calculate the
proportion of study participants who received,
opened, and read the messages; participants ’ratings
of messages in relation to trial outcomes.
f.Overall study fidelity of intervention delivery : This
will be assessed based on the delivery of each of the
intervention components as stated in the studyprotocol and action plan. We will measure this
using a structured checklist by direct observation of
the implementation of each of the intervention
components, noting any deviations from protocol/
action plan.
3. Retention measures: This will be calculated as the
proportion of committee members, peer counselors,
and enrolled study participants who remain in the
study at 3 and 6 months. We will also assess
reasons for attrition among the study drop-outs.
4. Data collection measures: We will assess the
proportion of completed surveys, time taken, and
number of visits/phone calls/reminders required to
complete surveys, levels of missing data, and reasons
for incomplete surveys and variable missingness.
5. Data required for sample size estimations for a
future definitive trial: These will be measured by
computing the intracluster correlation coefficient
(ICC), effect size estimates, variances, and 95%
confidence intervals for the potential differences
between the study arms at baseline and follow-up.
6. Acceptability and program satisfaction measures:
We will measure program satisfaction using a self-
reported rating among study participants. This will
be done for each of the components of and the
overall adapted intervention.
7. Measures for the end-points and psychological me-
diators for the proposed definitive trial: We will also
collect data on the primary and secondary end-
points for the proposed definitive trial and assess
the process of collecting this data. In the parent tri-
als, the primary outcomes were the number of serv-
ings of fruit and vegetables (F&V) and the minutes
of moderate to vigorous PA per day (MVPA). The
secondary outcomes included food consumption,
vegetable preparation practices, intrinsic/extrinsic
motivation, and self-efficacy to eat F&V and to in-
crease MVPA. The main trials also assessed psycho-
logical mediators like physical well-being,
depression, and religiosity indices. As with the par-
ent trials, we will use a modified version of the Na-
tional Cancer Institute (NCI) F&V food frequency
questionnaire to assess food intake over the past
month [ 51–53]. Vegetable preparation practices,
self-efficacy, and other health habits will be assessed
with an adapted version of the instruments devel-
oped for the eat for life program [ 54]. Intrinsic/ex-
trinsic motivation will be assessed with an adapted
version of the treatment self-regulation question-
naire (TSRQ) measure [ 55]. Physical activity and
sedentary behavior will be assessed using adaptedOdukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 9 of 15
versions of the International Physical Activity Ques-
tionnaire (IPAQ) and WHO STEPS tools [ 56,57].
Psychological mediators like physical well-being will
be measured using the widely used single item
measure on self-health [ 58]. Depression will be
assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9,
previously validated for use in this setting [ 59,60],
while religiosity and organized religious activity will
be measured with two variables, church attendance,
and private prayer frequency [ 61].
Sample size estimation
In a pilot trial, the objective is not necessarily to prove
superiority of the treatment but to test trial procedures
and processes and to obtain estimates of parameters for
the main trial sample size calculation. Therefore, stand-
ard sample size formulae which are used for main treat-
ment assessments are not usually applicable to pilot
trials [ 62,63] see Additional file 1. As recommended in
the CONSORT guidelines for publishing protocols of
pilot studies [ 62], we made a pragmatic decision to select
12 churches for the study and 25 participants per church
based on our knowledge of the church structure, its
demographics, and our pilot objectives.
Recruitment and retention strategies
Churches will make announcements for participation in
the project, during church services, and using bulletin
inserts or other usual means of communication. Trained
church volunteers and/or research assistants will help to
recruit interested participants. This will be based on par-
ticipant eligibility and on a first-come, first-served basis.
Recruited participants from each church will be selected
to participate in the individual program activities and
complete the surveys. Participant recruitment will be
conducted in the three study arms in the same manner
regardless of treatment allocation.
To promote participant retention, we will provide a
small incentive (a gift worth $5 or less) to all participants
regardless of the treatment arm. In addition, participants
will receive at least two text messages and one phone
call reminder to schedule a date for the follow-up sur-
veys. We expect to be able to complete participant en-
rolment over a period of 12 weeks and will aim for at
least 80% retention at the 6-month follow-up, noting
any differences in attrition rates between study groups.
Data collection
Study data will be collected at three-time points (at base-
line, then 3 and 6 months after) (Table 2). The adapted
questionnaires will be completed in the church premises ei-
ther before or after a routine church program, or as is con-
venient for the participant. Participants will have the choice
of filling in questionnaires by self-report or with theassistance of a trained interviewer and in their preferred
language. Survey tools wil l be translated and back-
translated into the preferred language of the parishioner if
the need arises. Participants not responding to the follow-
up questionnaires will be contacted on the telephone by
the trained interviewers and offered to complete the instru-
ment either by a scheduled home visit or over the phone.
We will analyse participants ’responses for those complet-
ing the instruments by self-report, with the help of trained
interviewers and by phone to observe for any statistically
significant differences. At t he end of each data collection
session, we will ask the participants to rate their level of sat-
isfaction with the data collection process. We will also note
the time taken and number of visits required to complete
each data collection session. At the end of the study, partic-
ipants will fill a brief survey to assess their self-reported ex-
posure, overall program satisfaction, and individual
satisfaction with each of the program components. Figure 2
shows the study flow chart for participant enrolment, base-
line data collection, follow-up, and analysis & Table 2
shows schedule of enrolment, interventions and
assesements
We will also conduct a series of focus group sessions
to qualitatively assess the implementation measures. We
will hold sessions with the study participants to obtain
their feedback about their opinions and experiences of
the BSS and BSS+ programs and processes, including
the facilitators and barriers to participant retention. We
will collect information on participants ’experiences of
the intervention and its components challenges with
completing questionnaires, their concerns about the
quality and delivery of each of the intervention compo-
nents, and any potential impediments to the successful
initiation of a definitive trial. We will conduct additional
focus group discussions with the data collectors, peer
counselors, and the members of the steering committees
to obtain their feedback of the study processes, experi-
ences with the program, and the challenges they may
have experienced with adhering to the protocol.
Data analysis:
Quantitative data analyses
As this is a pilot study, significance tests of change over
time will not be performed on the primary or secondary
outcomes. The main analysis will focus on descriptive sta-
tistics relating to feasibility to estimate likely recruitment,
retention, and participation rates. These will be repre-
sented by point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.
We will compute the intra class correlation coefficient, ef-
fect size, and variance and use these in addition to esti-
mates derived from the literature to estimate a sample size
required for a definitive trial, if deemed appropriate.
Quantitative data will be analyzed using STATA 15.0Odukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 10 of 15
Success indicators
The rationale for the success indicators was based on
the process values obtained in one of the parent tri-
als, where the process trial yielded 65.8% member
participation and 100% church participation rates
[64]. The success indicators for this pilot feasibility
trial would be to:1. Successfully develop a culturally adapted version of
the two RTI as evidenced by a clearly defined BSS
and BSS+action plan approved by the church
leadership and committee members.
2. Achieve the 70% recruitment targets for churches,
church volunteers, and study participants and the
time used to meet these targets.Table 2 Schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments
t1baseline, t23 months, t36 monthsOdukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 11 of 15
3. Successfully deliver the adapted intervention to at
least 70% of the selected churches.
4. Church compliance with at least 70% of the
intervention components and respondent
participation in at least 70% of the components.
5. Church retention rate of 100% at 6-month follow-
up and at 70% or more for church committee mem-
bers, volunteers, and study participants at 3 and 6
months.
6. Data completion rates and data completeness of ≥
70% for each outcome measure and data collection
method.
Qualitative data analyses
Audio-recorded interviews and focus groups will be
transcribed verbatim, and we will perform a content
analysis using standard thematic analytic techniques. At
least two independent researchers will code each tran-
script before subsequent summarization and interpret-
ation. Data will be analyzed with the Dedoose 8.18.
software [ 65].
Collectively, these will provide information on the
feasibility of the intervention implementation, trial pro-
cedures, data collection methods, and the overall accept-
ability of the intervention. The achievement of the
success criteria stated above, in addition to the qualita-
tive information generated from this pilot, will be con-
sidered in deciding whether or not to proceed with the
intervention, with or without amendments. We will note
which amendments to consider in developing a refined
version of the intervention protocol for a fully powered
trial to measure the effect of BSS and BSS+ on physical
activity and fruit and vegetable consumption among
church members.
Discussion
The described study protocol is intended to pilot-test
the feasibility and initial effects of the cultural adaptation
of two evidence-based interventions in church settings
using a 3-arm cluster RCT. The selected studies are a
part of National Cancer Institute research-tested inter-
vention programs (NCI-RTIPs) [ 11]. This is a database
of evidence-based cancer control programs, which have
been tested in a research study and have findings that
produced one or more positive behavioral and/or psy-
chosocial outcomes ( p≤.05) among individuals, com-
munities, or populations. To be listed on the NCI-RTIPs
database, evidence of study outcomes must have been
demonstrated using an experimental or quasi-
experimental study design [ 10]. We selected the Body
and Soul [ 32] and Health Body Healthy Spirit [ 33] be-
cause both programs were conducted in church-based
settings and among persons of African heritage. Body
and Soul focused primarily on improving fruit andvegetable intake while HBHS focused on increasing
physical activity. The adapted intervention will focus on
both healthy eating and physical activity, as these behav-
iors are often interrelated, and a combined intervention
may have a synergistic effect, compared with stand-alone
programs, which focus on only one behavioral outcome
[20,21].
The inclusion of the second intervention arm (i.e.,
BSS+) of the RCT was based on the premise that Nigeria
as with many LMICs have a rising proportion of mobile
phone users. We, therefore, sought to use this as a lever-
age and included a “plus”component into this study, to
determine if faith-based SMS prompters are feasible and
may be used to improve or sustain the effects of the
adapted intervention. The components of the BSS and
BSS plus have actions targeted at the individual and
community levels. This is in line with the recommenda-
tions of Coughlin et al. for multi-level interventions, in
their review of community-based studies targeting
healthy diet, nutrition, and weight management among
African Americans [ 66]. Many of the studies identified
in that review showed that community members are
often quite interested in community-based research and
are willing to work with researchers to ensure that the
interventions developed are tailored to the needs of their
community [ 67]. Ours is one of the first few studies in
sub-Saharan Africa that employs a partnership between
an academic institution and a church community to ad-
dress healthy diet and physical activity. Evidence gener-
ated from studies that involve partnerships between
academic institutions and community partners has the
potential to contribute new, scalable, and sustainable
findings to address key NCD risk factors within local
communities [ 66,67].
.
We expect that this pilot study will provide the evi-
dence base for the design, adaptation, and implementa-
tion of programs promoting PA and HFC in faith-based
settings in highly religious low- and middle-income
communities. The lessons learned would be useful in
adapting such EBI ’s to other faith-based settings, such as
those of the Islamic faith and to workplaces and other
community-based settings, to extend the impact of
research-tested interventions beyond the settings in
which they were developed. If the inclusion of the text
message prompters is found to increase the effectiveness
of these interventions, then there is the potential to
reach and influence large numbers of people at relatively
low cost. This holds great value for implementation and
sustainability in many resource-constrained countries.
Study limitation
As with other community-engaged health interventions,
one possible limitation that could occur is in balancingOdukoya et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:59 Page 12 of 15
fidelity and fit. This is because community participants
may have their own ideas about how the intervention
should be implemented, and this may be at variance with
our study protocol. We will therefore employ Castro
et al. ’s[49] recommendations on balancing fidelity and
fit as we implement this trial. We will also document
any variations between the proposed trial and the imple-
mented version.
Dissemination plan
Project findings will be disseminated to the health com-
mittees and church members at the diocese and in the
participating churches. Brief reports will be sent to the
community engagement/non-communicable disease
units of the state and federal ministries of health. Re-
ports will also be sent to local media.

Ethical approval has been obtained from the Health Research and Ethics
Committee of the College of Medicine, University of Lagos (CMUL/HREC/05/
18/347). Only individuals who have voluntarily provided written informed
will be enrolled in the study. To ensure the safety of participants and the
validity and integrity of the data, a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB)
will be established and meet approximately every 6 months. The DSMB will
include senior investigators with expertise in research methods, statistical
analysis, community health, physical activity, and nutrition. Adverse events,
though unlikely, could occur if participants do not adhere to our
intervention instructions for example, if a participant trips or falls while
attempting to be physically active or if a participant consumes
unwholesome fruits or vegetables resulting in gastroenteritis or other gastric
symptoms. The study ethical protocol makes provision for the possibility of
this occurrence by ensuring that participants are adequately informed and
educated to prevent possible adverse events. Participants will also be
advised on the appropriate actions to take should they occur. These events,
should they occur, will be reported to the Health Research and Ethics
Committee of the College of Medicine, University of Lagos and their
recommendations will be taken.
