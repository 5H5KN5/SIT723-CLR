Abstract 
Background Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) and child maltreatment are preventable threats to child 
health. Few evidence ‑based interventions target both SHS and child maltreatment risk. The purpose of this paper is 
to describe the systematic braiding process of two evidence ‑based programs to address child SHS in the home and 
maltreatment perpetration risk, and present results from the formative work and pilot study.
Methods The first 4 steps of the systematic braiding process were completed, including the following: (1) the 
identification of core elements of both programs, (2) the development of an initial draft of the braided curriculum 
(Smoke ‑Free Home SafeCare — SFH‑SC), (3) an acceptability and feasibility pilot of SFH‑SC with caregivers of young 
children who reported a smoker living in the home (N = 8), and (4) feedback collection on the braided curriculum 
from SafeCare Providers (N = 9).
Results Experts identified common pedagogical and theoretical underpinnings for the two programs and braided 
Smoke-Free Homes: Some Things Are Better Outside into two SafeCare modules. Caregiver feedback from the pilot dem‑
onstrated that participants were engaged with SFH‑SC and felt supported and comfortable discussing SHS interven‑
tion content with the SFH‑SC Provider. Caregiver self‑reports indicated a slight increase in smoke ‑free home rules 
from baseline to follow‑up and a notable reduction in parent stress on the Parent Stress Index of 5.9 points (SD = 10.2). 
SafeCare Provider feedback following intensive review of the curriculum indicated high feasibility for SFH‑SC delivery.
Conclusions Parent and Provider findings suggest SFH‑SC is a viable intervention that has potential to reduce the 
public health impact of SHS and child maltreatment for at ‑risk families.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• Uncertainties regarding the feasibility included the 
following: (1) Could SafeCare Providers be trained to 
effectively deliver a braided Smoke-Free Home Saf -
eCare curriculum, and would they be invested in the 
content? (2) Would SafeCare families engage in dis -
cussions regarding creating a smoke-free home? (3) 
Were the inclusion/exclusion criteria set for families 
appropriate?
• The key feasibility findings are as follows: (1) Saf -
eCare Providers were willing and capable to deliver 
the Smoke-Free Home SafeCare curriculum, (2) 
caregivers enrolled in and completed the braided 
curriculum, and (3) completers showed increases 
in smoke-free home rules and reductions in parent 
stress.
• Feasibility finding implications for the main study: 
The training and delivery approaches for Smoke-Free 
Home SafeCare were finalized and vetted, and based 
on the results, the training materials and protocol 
products were determined by the research team to be 
ready for implementation in the large Hybrid 1 trial. 
The study findings led the research team to make a 
change to the inclusion criteria related to smoking 
rules for caregiver participant enrollment.
Background
Child maltreatment risk and secondhand smoke exposure 
among young children
Young children living in under-resourced communities 
are disproportionately exposed to adverse childhood 
experiences that impact health [73, 23]. Specifically, chil -
dren living in low-socioeconomic status (SES) house -
holds are at 3 to 7 times greater risk for being victims of 
maltreatment compared to children in higher-SES house -
holds [4, 47, 50, 52, 55]. Child maltreatment (i.e., physical, 
sexual, emotional abuse, and neglect) is one of the most 
impactful adverse experiences on young children’s health, 
socioemotional development, and life course. Child mal -
treatment can lead to damage to the physical and neural 
structure of the brain [8, 58, 69], mental health difficul -
ties [25, 29, 38], and long-term physical health problems 
[7, 16, 18, 21, 44, 76].
Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure is also dis -
proportionately high among children living in low SES 
households [25, 35, 59]. The inverse relationship between 
SES and smoke exposure is well documented [14, 41, 48, 
53]. SHS exposure is associated with numerous child 
health conditions, including but not limited to sudden 
infant death syndrome, respiratory and ear infections, asthma attacks, impaired lung growth, and childhood 
cancer [2 , 70, 53, 76]. Higher rates of child behavioral 
problems have also been linked to SHS exposure in chil -
dren [62, 83]. Smoke-free homes mitigate these outcomes 
by reducing SHS exposure for both nonsmokers and chil -
dren [6 , 27, 63, 72]. Notably, programs targeting SHS pre -
vention are of greatest need among populations in which 
smoking bans are least common (e.g., households with 
low SES, one or two current smokers, parents with less 
than a college education, and single parents, [82]).
Child maltreatment and exposure to SHS are major, yet 
preventable threats to child health. Longitudinal studies 
have found beneficial effects of early intervention efforts 
for children living in resource-limited settings on long-
term health and a range of social and psychological out -
comes [5, 10, 19, 33, 34, 50, 72, 73]. Distinct, independent 
evidence-based interventions exist that reduce child mal -
treatment perpetration risk (e.g., [12, 13, 77] and SHS 
(e.g., [39]. However, to our knowledge, few evidence-
based programs exist which jointly target maltreatment 
risk and SHS exposure.
Intervention approaches for targeting two public health 
outcomes
There is an emerging literature on best practices for 
integrating two (or more) evidence-based programs to 
effectively and efficiently target multiple programmatic 
goals for children who are experiencing cumulative risk 
[15, 30]. One approach is to implement the interventions 
in a parallel  manner such that a client receives concur -
rent full doses of both programs [15, 45]. Limitations to 
the parallel approach include greater time burden and 
decreased engagement for program participants. An 
alternative approach is to systematically braid the inter -
ventions by explicitly identifying the similarities and dif -
ferences of the interventions’ conceptual theories, active 
practices in program delivery, and implementation pro -
cedures. Guastaferro et al. [30] standardized the method 
of systematic braiding and conducted a trial [31], in 
which two models with complementary foci were inte -
grated while maintaining fidelity to the programs and 
implementation infrastructures to address child abuse 
outcomes among families with young children. In the 
best of circumstances, two evidence-based interventions 
can be combined to effectively address multiple health 
risks in populations of focus.
The current study focuses on the systematic braiding 
of two evidence-based interventions that target child 
maltreatment prevention and child SHS exposure in the 
home. For child maltreatment risk, the SafeCare® pro -
gram was selected as the evidence-based intervention of 
focus. For child SHS exposure, the Smoke-Free Homes: 
Page 3 of 15
 Self‑Brown et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:81 
 
Some Things Are Better Outside (SFH) program was 
selected as the evidence-based program of focus.
SafeCare
SafeCare is typically delivered in child protection service 
settings, although it is also delivered in high-risk preven -
tion settings in some regions of the USA. SafeCare is a 
brief (18 weeks) home visitation program that is highly 
effective in reducing child maltreatment perpetration 
and improving behavioral outcomes for parents of young 
children (0 to 5  years) [12, 13, 77]. SafeCare includes 
18 total sessions, divided into three 6-session modules, 
including the following: (1) parent–child interaction, a 
module that promotes positive parenting skills in daily 
routines and play activities,(2) home safety, which offers 
parent education on common household hazards and 
the securement and removal of hazards to prevent unin -
tentional child injury,and (3) Child Health, a module 
that offers parental education on how to make effective 
health decisions when a young child is sick or injured. 
SafeCare is broadly disseminated across the USA and 
internationally. While SafeCare is primarily a program 
delivered via home visiting, since March 2020, the pro -
gram has also been delivered virtually, with over 80% of 
SafeCare Providers across the USA and abroad deliver -
ing virtual sessions [67].
Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated 
the positive impact of SafeCare with high-risk families, 
relative to case management services or to a no-treatment 
control, both in child welfare settings (i.e., after maltreat -
ment has occurred) and in prevention settings (i.e., serv -
ing families at risk for maltreatment) [11– 13, 46, 68]. In the 
largest published effectiveness study to date, a statewide 
comparative effectiveness trial of SafeCare in the Oklahoma 
child welfare system, SafeCare reduced child maltreatment 
recidivism by 26% relative to usual care [12, 13]. A recent 
study examining SafeCare effectiveness as compared to 
standard child welfare services across five states indicated 
that SafeCare participation was associated with favorable 
effects on parenting skills and parenting stress [77].
Smoke‑Free Homes: Some Things are Better Outside (SFH)
SFH is a brief intervention that is effective in promot -
ing adoption of smoke-free home rules among low-SES 
households [39, 56, 79]. SFH is designed to be a brief, 
6-week intervention that is comprised of print materials 
and one 15–20 min coaching call, where participants are 
encouraged to follow five steps to creating a smoke-free 
home. Information on smoking cessation support (i.e., 
contact information for Quitline, United Way) is included 
in the caregiver packet,however, this is not a primary 
focus or outcome of the program. Three randomized 
control trials document significant SFH intervention effects, with 40.0 to 62.9% of clients reporting a smoke-
free home at 6-month post-baseline [39, 56, 79]. The sta -
tus of self-reported smoke-free homes was confirmed by 
air nicotine concentration at 3-month post-baseline. SFH 
was also shown to be effective in a dissemination trial 
conducted with five 2–1-1 agencies across multiple states 
[9]. The intervention is listed on National Cancer Insti -
tute’s list of evidence-based cancer prevention and con -
trol interventions [49] and was disseminated to grantees 
of the California’s Tobacco Control Program.
Current study
Recent findings suggest there is a dire need for SHS 
prevention programs specifically for at-risk families 
as results from a SafeCare trial indicated that 61.3% 
(n = 174) of caregivers involved in interventions delivered 
through the child protection system reported daily smok -
ing [61]. These findings offer further justification for the 
importance of addressing SHS exposure among families 
who are engaged in the SafeCare program. Thus, the sys -
tematic braiding of the SafeCare and smoke-free home 
programs has the potential to be a scalable approach to 
reduce cumulative risk for negative health outcomes 
among young children. In this paper, we will describe 
the first four steps of systematic braiding of Smoke-
Free Home SafeCare (SFH-SC) and present results of 
the pilot study with caregivers of young children (step 
3) as well as the detailed feedback on the braided cur -
riculum from clinical program experts (step 4). System -
atic braiding is a five-step process [30] that includes (1) 
cross-training in both curricula to identify common con -
tent and pedagogical approaches, (2) development of the 
initial braided curriculum with input from experts, (3) 
piloting the braided curriculum in an acceptability and 
feasibility pilot with end users, (4) modifications and 
additional piloting as necessary, and (5) wide implemen -
tation of the braided curriculum. The findings described 
herein inform the procedures to test SFH-SC in a large 
NCI-funded Hybrid trial type 1 that will inform future 
implementation (step 5) and provide a roadmap for other 
systematically braided interventions to be delivered in 
child protective service settings.
Methods
Development of the SFH‑SC braided curriculum: Steps 1 
and 2 of systematic braiding
Program experts from both programs (Smoke-Free 
Homes: Some Things are Better Outside and SafeCare) 
completed the first two steps of the systematic braiding 
process prior to the pilot research. For step 1, experts 
identified the common content/pedagogical approaches 
of the two evidence-based programs, SafeCare and 
SFH. The selected programs were designed for similar 
Page 4 of 15 Self‑Brown et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:81 
populations and share theoretical underpinnings. Cen -
tral to both programs is social cognitive theory [3 , 
64] and addressing behavioral change by targeting (1) 
behavioral capability (e.g., individual knowledge and 
skill change), (2) parental self-efficacy, (3) goal setting, 
and (4) environmental change. The programs differ 
with respect to mode of delivery (SafeCare home vis -
iting vs SFH mailings and coaching call), dosage (Saf -
eCare 18 weeks vs SFH 6 weeks), and targeted skills (see 
Table 1 ).
In step 2 of the systematic braiding process, the 
program expert team drafted a braided curriculum. 
Informed by step 1, we braided the full SFH curric -
ula into the 6 sessions of both the Health and Safety 
modules of SafeCare. A family going through braided 
Smoke-Free Home and SafeCare (SFH-SC) curricula 
participated in either the Health or Safety module dur -
ing their first 6 SafeCare sessions and receive the full 
dose of the SFH program. The family then continued 
receiving the remaining two modules of SafeCare in its 
standard form. During step 2 of the systematic braiding 
process, the program expert team discussed the impor -
tance of considering the potential negative impact of 
the new SFH content in homes where risk for violence is 
high and whether new content (e.g., requesting a smoker 
living in the home to engage in behavioral change) may 
place family members at additional risk for violence. As 
part of existing SafeCare Provider training, all SafeCare 
Providers are deeply trained in the management of fam -
ily conflict and intimate partner violence prevention and intervention. Thus, while this certainly could be an 
important concern, SafeCare Providers know how to 
support these issues via assessment, problem-solving, 
and referral.
SFH‑SC pilot study: Step 3 of systematic braiding
Due to COVID-19 social distancing requirements and 
recent findings suggesting that the SafeCare Health 
module was the simplest to deliver virtually with fidel -
ity [67], we piloted the SFH-SC version braided into the 
Health module with only maternal caregivers. No com -
parison group was used. See Table  2 for a description of 
the braided SFH-SC Health module.
Caregiver Participants
Maternal caregivers were selected as the primary popula -
tion for recruitment for the pilot study because they are 
most commonly the target participant of evidence-based 
home visitation programs like SafeCare. Caregivers were 
eligible for the study if they met the following inclusion 
criteria: (1) reported there was a smoker that lives in the 
home at least 3 or more nights a week (either herself or 
another family member), (2) were aged 18 years or older, 
and (3) were the primary caregiver of a child (aged 0 to 
5  years) living in the home. Caregivers were excluded 
from the study if they reported that no smoker resided in 
the home.
Forty-nine maternal caregivers were referred from 
the partner sites (described in “Provider and proce -
dures section”) and were contacted for screening to

determine eligibility. After screening, we enrolled the 
first ten eligible participants. Recruitment ended after 
ten maternal caregivers consented and completed the 
baseline survey, and the study ended when the partici -
pants either dropped out or completed the interven -
tion. We chose to end recruitment after 10 participants 
completed baseline measures based on practical con -
siderations suggested in prior research, including budg -
etary constraints, the workflow for interventionists, 
and the number of participants needed to reason -
ably evaluate feasibility goals [70]. The average age 
for maternal caregiver participants was 32 (standard 
deviation [SD] = 11.8; Table  3), and the majority were 
non-Hispanic/Latinx (8 of 10) and Black or African 
American (8 of 10). Most mothers were single, never 
married (7 of 10), had completed a college degree (6 
of 10), and were not currently employed (7 of 10). The 
number of children in the home ranged from 1 to 10. 
Two caregivers dropped out of the study, one imme -
diately after the baseline survey and the second after 
2 sessions of SFH-SC. Eight caregivers completed the 
baseline survey, the SFH-SC intervention, and the post-
intervention survey.Caregiver Participant Procedures
All research was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board. Caregivers were recruited from three commu -
nity partner sites including two medical clinics serving 
Medicaid populations and a government assistance pro -
gram. Recruitment took place from May 7, 2021 through 
December 3, 2021. The research team used different 
recruitment methods based on COVID-19 protocols at 
each of the sites. At one clinic, we recruited in-person, 
and at another clinic, we posted flyers with study infor -
mation on the back of exam room doors. We sent recruit -
ment text messages to maternal caregivers involved in 
the government assistance program. Interested mothers 
either contacted or shared their contact information with 
the research team (either via Qualtrics or to the graduate 
research assistant doing in-person recruitment, depend -
ing on the partner site). Following consent, caregivers 
completed baseline measures via Zoom or telephone 
call, based on mothers’ preference. The baseline survey 
was completed in an interview style, in which the study 
staff asked the survey questions and entered the car -
egiver’s responses directly into REDCap. After complet -
ing the baseline survey, SFH-SC Providers contacted the

mothers within 24 h to begin SFH-SC (6 weekly sessions). 
At the conclusion of SFH-SC, mothers completed a post-
intervention survey and a brief qualitative interview, 
which took place between 6 and 8  weeks following the 
baseline survey. Mothers were compensated US $35 for 
the baseline survey, US $10 for each completed SFH-SC 
session, and US $40 for the post-intervention survey and 
interview, a total of up to US $135.
The SFH-SC Providers for the pilot were two Senior 
Training Specialists at the National SafeCare Training 
and Research Center, each with more than 8 years of Saf -
eCare experience. A SFH program expert trained Pro -
viders on SFH intervention and monitored intervention 
delivery for fidelity. Specifically, the SFH trainer listened 
to recordings of the braided SFH-SC sessions and pro -
vided feedback and support to ensure that the SFH por -
tion was implemented as planned. SFH-SC included six 
virtually delivered training sessions (Table 2).
Caregiver Participant Measures
Smoke-free home rules Items assessing smoking in 
the home included the following: 1) “Which statement 
best describes the rules about smoking inside your 
home (response options included: “smoking is…: is not 
allowed anywhere; is allowed in some places or at some 
times; smoking is allowed anywhere; or there are no 
rules?” 2) “What smoking products are covered by the 
rules? (response options included: smoke from ciga -
rettes, cigars/cigarillos, marijuana, vapor/aerosol from 
Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems [ENDs])” 3) “How 
often are your smoking rules broken by someone? (never, 
rarely, sometimes or very often)” [42, 43]
Smoking habits We asked three items to assess smoking 
habits of the participant and others living in the home. 
Items included the following: “ Are you a current smoker?” 
(Yes, no); “Do you live in the same house as someone who 
smokes?” (Yes, no; note: we did not ask who the smoker 
was if the response to this item was yes); and the number 
of smokers in the home.
Caregiver stress Parenting stress was measured by the 
validated Parent Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF), a 
36-item self-report measure [1, 33]. The PSI-SF consists 
of three subscales (i.e., parental distress, parent–child 
dysfunctional interactions, and difficult child) made up 
of 12 items each, as well as a subscale to measure a par -
ent’s defensive responding (7 items). For each item, par -
ents indicate the degree to which they agree or disagree 
with the statement by choosing one of the five response 
options on a Likert scale, with higher numbers indicating 
more parent stress.Demographics Mothers completed information docu -
menting their age, gender, race, ethnicity, relationship 
status, education level, employment, income, and num -
ber of children in the home.
Caregiver SFH‑SC intervention experience and satisfaction
Maternal participants completed a 1-h qualitative 
interview with study staff about their thoughts and 
experiences with SFH-SC. Study staff asked maternal 
participant questions specific to their attitudes toward 
SFH-SC, such as “What was it that you liked or disliked 
about the parenting program in general?” or “What was 
it that you liked or disliked about the added smoke-free 
home material?” Maternal participants were also asked 
how they felt discussing smoking habits and smoke-free 
home rules with SFH-SC specialists. This included ques -
tions such as “What helped to make it safe to talk about 
these [smoking] habits?” and “Did including a focus on 
creating a smoke-free home impact your engagement 
in any way?” Lastly, participants were asked to provide 
some suggestions for how future SFH-SC Providers could 
best navigate working with families who do have smokers 
in the home. Interviews were audio recorded.

The purpose of the curriculum review is to get Provider 
feedback on the novel SFH-SC curriculum.
Provider Participants
Providers were eligible to participate in this phase of the 
project if they were certified in SafeCare and were work -
ing in a US child protection or prevention service set -
tings within state that has CDC-documented high rates 
of tobacco use. Recruitment took place from Decem -
ber 2021 through February 2022 and was stopped when 
9 Providers consented to the study. Providers inter -
viewed had an average of 6 years of SafeCare experience 
(range = 2 to 14 years).
Provider Procedures
An email was sent via the National SafeCare Training 
and Research Center Provider listserv. The recruitment 
email offered information on the inclusion criteria and 
the curriculum review study. Providers were invited to 
respond to the email if they were interested. A mem -
ber of the research team contacted the first 10 Provid -
ers who responded to the initial recruitment email and 
consented the Providers via Zoom. Providers received an 
electronic version of the SFH-SC curriculum (including 
the SFH materials that go to families) via email and were 
also mailed a hard copy and were asked to review the 
Page 8 of 15 Self‑Brown et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:81 
materials over a 2-week period. After the review period, 
the 9 US SafeCare-certified Providers completed the 2-h 
review of the SFH-SC braided curriculum and partici -
pated in a subsequent 1-h feedback interview with study 
staff. Providers were compensated with a US $200 Ama -
zon gift card.
Provider Measures
SFH- SC curriculum feedback interview Study staff  
asked Providers about their overall impression of the 
braided curriculum, their perception of the utility of a 
smoke-free home intervention for their clients, and the 
benefits of a smoke-free home intervention. Provid -
ers were also asked to share their thoughts on how well 
the SFH materials fit into each SafeCare module (safety, 
health, parent–child interaction). Finally, Providers 
shared feedback about their perceived potential barriers 
and facilitators to delivering SFH-SC. Surveys were audio 
recorded.
SFH- SC feasibility Providers completed a brief survey 
through REDCap that assessed the feasibility of SFH-
SC after they completed the curriculum review and fol -
low-up interview. The survey consisted of 4 items that 
assessed feasibility of SFH-SC, including Provider per -
ceptions of (1) how receptive families with a smoker in 
the home would be to SFH-SC, (2) the potential impact 
of SFH-SC on creating a smoke-free home, (3) Provider 
openness to participate in additional training for SFH-
SC, and (4) how well the SFH materials fit with each of 
the modules of SafeCare. Response options were on a 
5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very difficult) to 5 
(very easy). The overall score ranged from 4 to 20; higher 
scores indicate greater feasibility.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were computed using SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc., 2013) for the quantitative data collected 
in steps 3 and 4, which included the maternal demo -
graphics, smoke-free home rules, smoking habits, parent 
stress, and Provider feasibility survey. Quantitative anal -
yses included only those who completed the interven -
tion (n = 8) to understand if the measures selected were 
sensitive enough to detect changes in smoke-free home 
rules and behaviors and parenting stress following the 
intervention (SFH-SC); however, no statistical tests were 
conducted, as the aim of the pilot was to assess the feasi -
bility of SFH-SC [22]. The qualitative interviews collected 
with caregivers in step 3 were transcribed by members of 
the research team, and a thematic analysis was conducted 
to summarize key themes. The qualitative data collected with participants in step 4 was summarized into key 
points for each question and reviewed by two study staff.

Caregiver Demographics
The demographics of caregivers who participated in the 
pilot are summarized in (Table 4).
Smoking habits and smoke‑free home rules
In the baseline survey, 2 of the 8 caregiver participant com -
pleters reported being current smokers (Table  5). Seven of 
the 8 participants lived in the same household with some -
one else who smoked. In terms of existing smoke-free 
home rules, half of the participants reported having a full 
smoking ban in the home, and the other half reported that 
smoking was allowed in some places or at some times in 
the home. There were small increase in caregiver-reported 
smoke-free home rules from baseline to the 8-week post-
intervention survey among study completers.Table 4 Demographic characteristics of caregivers participating

 Caregiver SFH‑SC intervention experience and satisfaction
SafeCare and smoke‑free home materials
All participants indicated they thought the SafeCare 
health materials and health manual are beneficial for par -
ents. They also noted that the SFH materials were very 
informative, particularly regarding how smoking affects 
children’s health. One participant stated the following:I definitely think it’s beneficial and helpful to people 
who don’t understand the long-term effects of smok -
ing in the home just like myself. For instance, I felt 
as long as we don’t smoke around the kids…then it 
shouldn’t be a concern and that’s not true.
Some participants (n = 2) who had taken steps to cre -
ate a smoke-free home prior to the study felt that the 
smoke-free home materials confirmed that taking 
those steps were correct and that those steps should be 
acknowledged or celebrated. Participants mentioned that 
the smoke-free home component and materials helped 
to create, enforce, and reinforce smoke-free home rules 
(n = 3) and helped to begin conversations about smok -
ing and provide approachable materials with helpful Table 5 Self‑reported feasibility outcomes for limited efficacy among caregivers who completed the SFH‑SC pilot

information to the smoker in the home (n = 5). For exam -
ple, one participant noted as follows:
In the past, I would say [to the other smoker in the 
home] smoke in the other room, but now I see that 
even if you’re in the other room or in the house in 
general it can still affect people and to me that was 
[a] change in my thinking for how serious it was, 
so that’s really what pushed me to do it [establish 
smoke-free home rules].
Another participant indicated the following:
It was really helpful for me to have those materials 
cause it was kind of like a way for start to have those 
conversations with my dad… it was helpful for like a 
conversation that would’ve been hard for me to have 
otherwise.
Discussing smoke‑free home rules with the SafeCare Provider
Overall, despite the sensitive nature of the topic, most 
participants reported having positive experiences 
when discussing the impact of having a smoke-free 
home on child health and establishing smoke-free 
rules with the SafeCare Provider (n  = 7). In fact, two 
of the participants mentioned that the most helpful 
part of the SFH-SC program was discussing smoking 
in the home and options to create a smoke-free home 
with the Provider. When participants were asked about 
their experiences talking to the SafeCare Provider 
about smoking in the home, they reported that they 
felt comfortable because the Providers were easy to 
talk to, open-minded, and non-judgmental. One par -
ticipant described as follows:
It felt like a judgement-free zone. There was no judge -
ment. I don’t feel like…[the providers responses] 
made me feel like I could talk to [them] about the 
smoking habits in general.
Participants emphasized the critical importance 
of Providers being non-judgmental and speaking in 
a neutral tone to avoid shaming smoking behaviors. 
Participants suggested that for future SFH-SC deliv -
ery, Providers should avoid pressuring parents to make 
certain changes or coming across as condescending or 
seeming like an expert. One participant offered a sum -
mary of these recommendations, stating the following:
It’s all about your approach, the tone you use, so if 
you have sort of a neutral approach, neutral tone 
and it doesn’t come off as badgering or act like you 
know it all or you’re better than them because you 
don’t do certain things then they’ll receive it in a 
good manner.Participant engagement in Smoke‑Free Home SafeCare
Participant completers reported the content was highly 
engaging. One participant stated the following:
I really was like crunched for time… but I always 
found time even if I had to reschedule a few times 
to have those meetings with [the provider] because 
I really enjoyed the program and I knew I was being 
informed with things that I may not have known….
Participants provided recommendations to enhance 
the program, including involving all caregiver parties 
(i.e., smoker in the home if the smoker is not the car -
egiver partaking in the program), allowing children to be 
a part of or have a say in the program, offer education on 
other coping mechanisms to relieve stress, and provide 
resources for individuals with financial issues or other 
struggles.
Provider review of SFH‑SC curriculum: Step 4 systematic 
braiding
General feedback on the braided curriculum
During the interview after reviewing the braided cur -
riculum, Providers indicated that they were interested 
in SFH-SC, even if SHS exposure was not a particular 
concern for the majority of families they serve, because 
they felt the added SFH content complemented the 
goals of SafeCare. They also appreciated having this 
topic integrated into SafeCare for families where there 
is a smoker in the home, with one participant stating 
the following:
Having [materials about SHS prevention already] 
integrated so we don’t have to pull resources our -
selves would be helpful. A combined intervention is 
a double win.
When considering the SFH content fit with the Saf -
eCare modules, Providers indicated that they thought 
the SFH materials did not align well with the parent–
child interaction module but fit very well with the 
Health and Safety modules. The Providers made sug -
gestions for ways to further integrate the SFH content 
into the SafeCare sessions, by spending some time 
going over all materials that are provided to parents on 
the topic versus asking parents to review on their own. 
The Providers indicated that taking the time to dis -
cuss SFH content with parents would complement the 
active delivery structure of SafeCare in which content 
is explained and modeled by the Provider followed by 
parents’ practice with corrective feedback as needed. 
Following the same active delivery structure was sug -
gested to help make SFH-SC feel like one integrated 
program to the parent.

Program engagement
Providers noted the sensitive nature of discussing smok -
ing and smoking in the home with caregivers and were 
concerned about how this discussion could impact family 
engagement in SafeCare. Participants mentioned that it 
would be critical to build a strong rapport with the fam -
ily before launching into the complex topics addressed in 
SFH-SC. One Provider noted the following:
[In terms of] engagement, it would come down to 
how you do it. It is more of a how you do it than a 
what it is… Conversational prompts about how to 
introduce these materials would be helpful.
SafeCare Provider SFH‑SC feasibility survey
All SafeCare Providers reported that the Smoke-Free 
Home SafeCare would improve clients’ abilities to cre -
ate a smoke-free home (M = 4.55; SD = 0.53). Addition -
ally, most SafeCare Providers (78%) reported that they 
would be willing to participate in additional training to 
be certified in SFH-SC (M = 4.11; SD = 1.05). The majority 
of Provider participants indicated that the SFH materials 
fit best in the Safety module (89%) or the Health module 
(78%) and least with the parent–child interaction module 
(M = 2.22; SD = 1.48). Over half of the Providers (56%) 
indicated that the curriculum would be easy to deliver as 
designed. Overall, SafeCare Providers indicated that they 
thought the SFH-SC curriculum was feasible (M = 4.0 
[max = 5]; SD = 0.59).
Discussion
The study purpose was to fill a gap in existing inter -
vention science by using an innovative approach (sys -
tematic braiding) to leverage existing evidence-based 
interventions to address two significant public health 
issues among young children. The first four steps of sys -
tematic braiding were successfully completed. Results 
from the SFH-SC pilot study suggest that maternal car -
egivers benefited from participation in SFH-SC and were 
engaged and satisfied with the program. Results from 
the Providers’ SFH-SC curriculum review suggest that a 
few additional curriculum modifications were needed to 
finalize SFH-SC for further evaluation (i.e., type 1 hybrid 
trial). Furthermore, Providers consistently reported that 
the program would be feasible and includes very impor -
tant content for families at risk, including those involved 
in child protection services.
SFH‑SC Caregiver Outcomes
In the pilot, 80% of caregivers were retained through 
SFH-SC intervention delivery and completed both base -
line and post-intervention surveys. These results are 
promising, given that retaining parents in prevention program research often proves challenging. For example, 
prior SafeCare studies reported retention rates of par -
ticipants ranging from 50% [17] to 61% [66], respectively, 
though the timing of these studies is generally much 
longer (up to 1 year) than in this pilot. The retention rates 
are also important to consider within the context and 
timing of the trial, which took place in the midst of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in 2021–2022. Maternal caregiver 
participants were socioeconomically disadvantaged, 
recruited from community partners that serve families 
living in under-resourced communities. The success in 
retaining the population is promising for future studies 
examining the effectiveness of the braided curriculum.
Most mothers recruited for the trial were not smok -
ers themselves (4 out of 10 recruited reported smoking, 
2 of the 8 completers) but were living in the home with 
someone else who smoked (9 out of the 10 recruited, 
all 8 completers). Notably, of the two participants who 
identified as a smoker at baseline, one dropped out of 
the study. For the primary outcome, smoke-free home 
rules, no substantial changes emerged from the base -
line to post-intervention surveys. This was surprising, 
given prior effectiveness observed in the SFH interven -
tion [39, 40]. One explanation for this could be that the 
participant themselves was not necessarily the smoker in 
the home. Family dynamics and the sensitive nature of 
smoking could pose barriers to establishing smoke-free 
home rules. For example, if a maternal participant lives 
with an elder family member who smokes and pays for 
the home, it may be more challenging to establish smoke-
free home rules than it would be for a participant who 
is the smoker and pays for housing themselves. Further -
more, upon closer examination of the pilot study results, 
a critical limitation in the study inclusion criteria was 
illuminated. Specifically, 50% of the sample reported that 
they already had a full smoking ban in their home, and 
all participants reported at least some smoke-free home 
rules were already in place. Based on this feasibility work, 
we will add an additional inclusion criteria in our future 
studies such that only participants who allow smoking in 
the home will be eligible to participate.
A meta-analysis by Kaminski et  al. [80] found that as 
parenting programs get more diffuse, the impact on tar -
get outcomes can be negatively impacted. We explored 
parenting outcomes, but as the purpose was to demon -
strate acceptability and feasibility, we did not examine 
efficacy. Mothers reported reductions in parenting stress 
from the baseline to post-intervention, consistent with 
finding in prior SafeCare published studies (e.g., [77]). 
Our finding of reduced stress is promising and suggests 
that the braided program did not negatively impact the 
primary parenting outcomes targeted by SafeCare. Fur -
thermore, this suggests the SafeCare active ingredients 
Page 12 of 15 Self‑Brown et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:81 
were maintained even with the integration of the smoke-
free home materials in this preliminary work.
Caregiver participant completers’ feedback in the qual -
itative interviews suggested they thought the materials 
for both SafeCare and SFH were useful for parents. While 
mothers acknowledged that having conversations about 
smoking in the home can be a sensitive topic, they noted 
that the smoke-free home materials reinforced the rules 
they had implemented and offered effective approaches 
to sharing this information with other smokers living in 
the home. Mothers indicated that their conversations 
with SafeCare Providers about creating a smoke-free 
home were very useful and proceeded in a non-judgmen -
tal way. This is particularly important as prior research 
with nationally implemented home visiting prevention 
programs found that Providers did not feel well-prepared 
to address parental tobacco use, with concerns it would 
negatively affect program engagement [20]. The braided 
SFH-SC curriculum was well-accepted and did not 
appear to negatively impact parent program engagement 
for the completers in our pilot, as noted by the high rates 
of completion and mothers’ qualitative responses. Col -
lectively, these data suggest high feasibility and relevance 
for the braided intervention.
SafeCare Providers SFH‑SC Feedback
In terms of SafeCare Provider curriculum feedback, 
participants noted that SFH compliments the goals 
of SafeCare, with both targeting the creation of a 
safe and stable home environment for young chil -
dren. This is commensurate with an ongoing move -
ment in the child maltreatment field that underscores 
the utility of prevention programs that could address 
diverse risks simultaneously to promote child well-
being and safety [80]. Providers commented that hav -
ing the smoke-free materials integrated into SafeCare 
could save them time by reducing the need for them 
to search for additional resources to prevent SHS 
with the families they serve.
Providers reported that they would be willing to par -
ticipate in workshop training and implement the pro -
gram with families for SFH-SC if this program was to 
become readily available. They stated both in interviews 
and on the feasibility survey that the SFH content fits 
best in the SafeCare Health and Safety modules. Pro -
viders also noted the importance of building a strong 
rapport with mothers before tackling topics related to 
smoking and tobacco use, which was commensurate 
with feedback offered by mothers in the pilot. Accord -
ingly, training on rapport building and non-judgmental 
approaches to encourage parent engagement in SFH-SC 
will be highlighted in the Provider workshop training 
for the hybrid trial.Providers did have some suggestions for curriculum 
modifications regarding how SFH could be further inte -
grated into SafeCare. Specifically, they recommended 
the research team consider deeper discussion of the 
SFH materials as part of the braided session, as well as 
utilizing the standard SafeCare approaches (e.g., Pro -
vider modeling and parent practice) when reviewing 
the materials with parents. These were important con -
siderations; however, a decision was ultimately made to 
maintain the fidelity of the original SFH materials in the 
final braided curriculum for several reasons. First, in its 
evidence-based, original delivery format (mailings and 
one coaching phone call), SFH has made a strong impact 
on smoke-free home rules in randomized trials [39, 40]. 
Second, the child welfare workforce is already expe -
riencing high job-related demands and is often under 
resourced [65]. Since the future trial is planned to be 
delivered in two states where SafeCare is implemented 
in child protection services, we attempted to avoid as 
much workload burden for Providers as possible while 
maintaining the integrity of the two original programs. 
Including some of the Provider recommendations, such 
as additional psychoeducation and modeling of some of 
the smoke-free home content, could greatly extend ses -
sion duration. Lastly, the potential scalability and public 
health impact of SFH-SC, if found to be effective, are a 
major goal for this research,thus, the grant funding does 
not support substantial changes to the time for delivery 
of SFH braided into SafeCare as part of child protective 
system implementations. Future research could expand 
on this work to explore adaptations to further optimize 
the delivery of SFH-SC [32].
Limitations
The formative work described herein is promising and 
will be useful to future teams working on systematic 
braiding efforts, but is not without limitation. First, there 
was a small number of participants who participated in 
this pilot work. Accordingly, there was no power to assess 
statistically significant differences in outcomes or explore 
potential moderators/mediators related to outcome 
change, and the generalizability of the findings is limited. 
Second, while the caregiver participants were experienc -
ing some risk factors related to socioeconomic status, 
none was involved in child protections services, an inclu -
sion criterion in the upcoming hybrid trial, which may 
impact program engagement and retention and further 
limits the generalizability of the current findings. Third, 
there were no control participants included to allow for 
comparison on the outcome variables. Fourth, the reli -
ance of self-report measures for both the smoke-free 
home and parenting outcomes are subject to social desir -
ability bias. To address some of these sources of bias in 
Page 13 of 15
 Self‑Brown et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:81 
 
subsequent research, we will use air monitors to corrobo -
rate the self-report of smoke-free home rules. Fifth, the 
current assessment measures did not identify who the 
tobacco user was in the home if it was not the primary 
caregiver. This is important to ask in future research 
because who the tobacco user is may have significant 
implications for success in establishing smoke-free home 
rules.
Conclusions, next steps, and future directions
Upwards of 3.5 million children in the USA are the sub -
jects of a child protection report each year [72]. Par -
ents of these children access services, such as SafeCare, 
while they are involved with the child protection system. 
Evidence-based interventions designed to simultane -
ously target multiple risk factors that negatively affect 
child health and well-being, such as child maltreat -
ment and SHS, could have a meaningful public health 
impact for at-risk families. Furthermore, using innova -
tive approaches to leverage complementary evidence-
based interventions that tackle different public health 
outcomes, is imperative to advance the field of inter -
vention science, maximizing the outcomes of efforts 
that are costly to deliver and are burdensome in terms 
of time. Systematic braiding is one promising, innova -
tive approach that could be used to advance the field of 
intervention science and to create cost-effective public 
health impact through the improved, efficient dissemi -
nation of evidence-based interventions to create clini -
cally meaningful changes for children and families and 
improve health equity.
Future directions in this work include a Hybrid type 
1 trial, funded by the National Cancer Institute, where 
SafeCare Providers working in child protective and pre -
vention service systems in the USA will be recruited and 
randomly assigned to either SFH-SC (offered in either the 
SafeCare Health or Safety module) or Standard SafeCare. 
Providers will each serve 10 research families (N = 500) 
who report a smoker living in the home and no current 
smoke-free home rules. If the sample allows, we will 
explore variables, including who the tobacco user is in the 
home, as potential moderators of program engagement, 
dropout, and the smoke-free home rule outcomes. The 
primary outcome, smoke-free home status, will be meas -
ured via self-report, and smoke-free home rules will be 
validated via air nicotine monitors. Process measures will 
be collected to examine how SFH-SC impacts Provider 
fidelity, delivery time and costs, and parent engagement.
