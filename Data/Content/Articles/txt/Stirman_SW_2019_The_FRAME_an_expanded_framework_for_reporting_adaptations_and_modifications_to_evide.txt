The FRAME: an expanded framework for
reporting adaptations and modifications to
evidence-based interventions
Shannon Wiltsey Stirman1*, Ana A. Baumann2and Christopher J. Miller3,4
Abstract
Background: This paper describes the process and results of a refinement of a framework to characterize modifications
to interventions. The original version did not fully capture several aspects of modification and adaptation that may be
important to document and report. Additionally, the earlier framework did not include a way to differentiate cultural
adaptation from adaptations made for other reasons. Rep orting additional elements will allow for a more precise
understanding of modifications, the process of modifying or adapting, and the relationship between different forms of
modification and subsequent healt h and implementation outcomes.
Discussion: We employed a multifaceted approach to develop the updated FRAME involving coding documents
identified through a literature review, rapid coding of qualitative interviews, and a refinement process informed by
multiple stakeholders. The updated FRAME expands upon Stirman et al. ’s original framework by adding components of
modification to report: (1) when and how in the implementation process the modification was made, (2) whether the
modification was planned/proactive (i.e., an adaptation) or unplanned/reactive, (3) who determined that the
modification should be made, (4) what is modified, (5) at what level of delivery the modification is made, (6) type or
nature of context or content-level modifications, (7) the extent to which the modification is fidelity-consistent, and (8)
the reasons for the modification, including (a) the intent or goal of the modification (e.g., to reduce costs) and (b)
contextual factors that influenced the decision. Methods of using the framework to assess modifications are outlined,
along with their strengths and weaknesses, and considerations for research to validate these measurement strategies.
Conclusion: The updated FRAME includes consideration of when and how modifications occurred, whether it was
planned or unplanned, relationship to fidelity, and reasons and goals for modification. This tool that can be used to
support research on the timing, nature, goals and reasons for, and impact of modifications to evidence-based
interventions.
Keywords: Modification, Adaptation, Cultural adaptation, Implementation outcomes
Background
Adaptation, a key concept in implementation, has been
defined as a process of thoughtful and deliberate alter-
ation to the design or delivery of an intervention, with
the goal of improving its fit or effectiveness in a given
context [ 1,2]. It is a form of modification, which is a
broader concept that encompasses any changes made to
interventions, whether deliberately and proactively
(adaptation), or in reaction to unanticipated challengesthat arise in a given session or context [ 3,4]. The
process, nature, and outcomes of modifications to
evidence-based programs/practices (EBPs) have often
not been well documented, despite considerable recent
interest in the field of implementation science [ 5,6].
Consequently, modification has historically not been
fully evaluated or understood.
Understanding what, how, and when modifications
occur is a vital aspect of implementation science because
the process of implementing EBPs is dynamic [ 7]. Modi-
fications may occur for a variety of purposes and with
differing implications. Some may enhance outcomes,
particularly if they more closely align the intervention

with the needs of the specific population in a particular
system or context. In fact, modifications that focus on
increasing the fit of the EBPs with the target population
can lead to improved engagement, acceptability, and
clinical outcomes, particularly when working with mi-
nority populations [ 8–10]. However, modifications that
remove key elements of an intervention, or fail to align
with population needs, may be less effective [ 7,11–14].
Inconsistent reporting has resulted in uncertainty re-
garding modification ’s impact on health and the types of
modifications that can maximize implementation suc-
cess [ 15,16].
Without understanding forms of modification that
occur, the systematic evaluation of processes and strat-
egies that lead to more and less successful implementation
may be hindered [ 2,17–19]. To facilitate a more nuanced
consideration of modifications and to work toward identi-
fying forms of modifications that may enhance specific in-
terventions vs. those that may reduce effectiveness [ 16],
Stirman and colleagues previously developed a Framework
for Modification and Adaptations [ 16]. This framework
characterized different forms of modifications to interven-
tions, and later work differentiated fidelity-consistent from
fidelity-inconsistent modification [ 1,2,16]. More recently,
other research groups have used the framework to
characterize modifications to various healthcare interven-
tions and prevention programs [ 20–23]. Some key aspects
of the 2013 framework were shown to have high clarity
(rater agreement) and acceptable to high coverage (per-
centage of identified adaptations that could be classified
using the taxonomy; [ 24]).
Despite its value in distinguishing and categorizing dif-
ferent forms of modifications, the original framework
did not capture other considerations that may be im-
portant to document. Because it was originally devel-
oped largely to identify forms of modification rather
than to fully document the process itself, it did not in-
clude potential reasons for modifications, which can
range from improving individual or contextual fit (e.g.,
[20,21,25,26]) to addressing systemic constraints. In
2017, Baumann et al. consulted the implementation lit-
erature and the literature on social determinants of
health and engaged in a consensus process to expand
the framework to include possible reasons for adaptation
[15], a process that differed from the original process of
framework development. They recommended additional
work to refine the resulting framework.
As we planned a process to refine the framework further,
we identified additional limitations and opportunities for
expansion. For example, while the 2013 and 2017 frame-
works [ 15,16] laid out distinct forms of modification that
could be made to the content or mode of delivery, they did
not specify when those modifications were designed to ad-
dress important differences be tween the original populationand the stakeholders in the current implementation effort
(i.e., cultural adaptations). The frameworks also did not
specify whether modifications were planned (i.e., adapta-
tions) or unplanned (e.g., [ 2,4,27]), or allow investigators
to consider modifications in co njunction with fidelity, a re-
lated but distinct implementation outcome [ 1]. Further, we
recognized that other aspects of reporting that may be im-
portant for improving understanding of modification and
its impact, such as when in the i mplementation process the
modification was made, were also not included [ 28–31]. To
address the aforementioned is sues, our goal was to develop
a refined framework that expanded the original framework
to facilitate documentation of additional aspects of the im-
plementation process.
Process for refining the framework
We employed a pragmatic, multifaceted approach,
detailed in Table 1, to develop a more comprehensive
strategy for characterizing adaptation design and
process. This approach included multiple sources of data
that better aligned with our goals than approaches such
as scoping or systematic reviews [ 32]. We chose this
pragmatic approach because several systematic reviews
of adaptation have been published in recent years, and
we recognized that such reviews might not capture as-
pects of modification and adaptation that had not been
adequately documented.
Review of the literature
We first searched the literature and identified existing
frameworks, systematic reviews, and discussions of adapta-
tions of public health and behavioral health interventions
that had been published since 2013 [ 1,6,29,33]. We also
drew on systematic reviews of intervention modifications
and adaptations, existing adaptation frameworks, and re-
views on cultural adaptation [ 3–5,15,17,20,21,33,34].
We employed a snowballing approach to examine a total
of 170 individual articles in the literature that described ad-
aptations to interventions. After reviewing all articles from
three systematic reviews [ 1,17,29], we implemented a
“stop rule ”such that if no new aspects of adaptation were
identified after examining 10 original sources from each
additional systematic review, we ceased reviewing individ-
ual articles. Additionally, we examined two widely cited
frameworks of implementation that listed potential deter-
minants [ 30,35] and a framework of social determinants
of health [ 36,37] to further refine the reasons for adapta-
tion. After steps 1 –8( T a b l e 1) were complete, we piloted
the resulting framework by coding a sample of articles and
interview responses to ensure that no additional elements
of adaptation were identified, once again implementing the
10-article “stop rule ”.Wiltsey Stirman et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:58 Page 2 of 10
Reviewing qualitative data
To complement our literature review, we conducted a
rapid coding process with a set of responses to questions
about adaptation. We generated the responses from inter-
views with 55 mental health providers and administrators
that detailed processes and reasons for adaptation of a psy-
chosocial intervention (see Table 1). These interviews were
conducted through studies on sustainability and adaptation
[2,38].
Data consolidation
Using the information gener ated through the two data
sources, we categorized both re asons for adaptation and as-
pects of the adaptation process not captured in the previous
framework. We then collapsed similar subcategories and
organized them by consensus among the three authors.
Framework refinement
Finally, to increase the likelihood that the updated frame-
work would document aspects of modification and adap-
tation that were important to stakeholders, we presented adraft of the framework to several groups of stakeholders
and solicited suggestions regarding additions, refinements,
and clarifications.
Overview of the resulting framework and reporting
recommendations
Our approach yielded several additions and refinements to
the original framework, which are indicated in bold in Fig. 1.
Just as Proctor and colleagues [ 39]a d v o c a t ef o ram u l t i f a -
ceted approach to reporting imp lementation strategies, our
framework is intended to fac ilitate comprehensive docu-
mentation of modifications. O ur Framework for Reporting

Steps Process/operationalization
1. Identify goal and scope Goals: Identify reasons for adaptation not presented in Baumann et al. [ 15];
determine other aspects of the modification or adaptation process that
should be documented
2. Identify relevant literature Searched the literature for systematic reviews and adaptation frameworks
(additional details about search terms and processes available from first
author) employed a snowballing process to sample underlying source
literature for review (SWS)
3. Identify information about adaptation that was
not captured in the previous framework1. Identify descriptions of the process and reasons for adaptation in the
published literature
2. Compare to the existing framework
3. Extract novel (a) descriptions and categorizations of modifications and
adaptations, (b) reasons for modification or adaptation, (c) recommendations
for adaptation, (d) descriptions of the process of adaptations, and (e)
discussions of limitations of the existing frameworks and adaptation
literature (SWS)
4. Added novel descriptions and information to a spreadsheet, employing
a stop rule (e.g., when no additional information is extracted in the subsequent 10 articles)
5. Rapid coding of 55 interviews Reviewed memos and notes generated by two trained research assistants who applied
the 2017 framework to questions about the adaptation process. Extracted summaries
about aspects of adaptation not included in the framework and added to a spreadsheet (SWS)
6. Check extraction results for completeness Reviewed a subset of articles and interview responses to ensure that extraction was complete
(CM, AB), arrived at consensus using a stop rule (e.g., when no additional information is extracted
in the subsequent 10 articles)
7. Classify resulting items to create a complete list
of possible reasons for adaptation and specify
other aspects of the adaptation process to be
documentedReviewed the items extracted from the literature and from interviews to categorize reasons for
adaptation. Compare the information from the two data sources and finalize broad categories.
Collapse and organize similar subcategories (SWS, AB, CM; by consensus).
8. Integrate stakeholder feedback Presented the revised framework, along with the rationale and methodology, to three different
groups of stakeholders (implementation researchers, implementation project leaders, practitioners,
and intervention developers) at seven different meetings with an explicit request for feedback.
Suggestions regarding additions, refinements, and clarifications were recorded, discussed, and
added to the framework by team consensus (SWS, AB, CM)
9. Piloted framework Coded articles with a predetermined stop rule (planned stop when no additional information that
was not covered in FRAME was identified after 10 articles). Ten articles were coded with no new
information identifiedWiltsey Stirman et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:58 Page 3 of 10
for the modification, includin g (a) the intent or goal of the
modification (e.g., improve fit, adapt to a different culture,
reduce costs, etc.) and (b) contextual factors that influenced
the decision. Below, we descri be in further detail aspects of
the FRAME, with attention to aspects not included in the
original framework.
When and how in the implementation process the
modification was made
Timing, not included in the original framework, is import-
ant to measure as modification can occur in any phase of
the long-term implementation process: pre-implementation
activities, an implementati on phase, and scale-up and
sustainment [ 40–42]. During the planning or pre-imple-
mentation phase, there are opportunities to anticipate
changes and discover adaptations that need to be made
through a pilot phase. Despite these efforts, new challenges,
constraints, or potential enhancements may come to light
during the implementation p hase. During scale-up or
scale-out, other changes may be necessary, particularly for
contexts where the interven tion is likely to reach popula-
tions that may differ from the population that received theintervention during implementation [ 43]. Additionally, dur-
ing sustainment, changes in the system or population
served by that system may also necessitate changes [ 7,44,
45].
Whether the modification was planned/proactive or
unplanned/reactive
Reporting on when and how decisions to modify interven-
tions are made will allow investigation of whether planned
adaptations are different in nature or in outcomes than
those that are improvised during implementation. To avoid
unplanned or reactive modifi cations that are inconsistent
with an intervention ’s goals, research base, or theory, inves-
tigators have advocated a process of planned adaptation
[46], ideally as early as possible in the implementation
process. However, in practice, many modifications are made
less systematically [ 4]. Reactive modifications have been de-
fined as those that “occur during the course of program im-
plementation, often due to unanticipated obstacles ”[47].
These modifications often occur in an impromptu manner,
in reaction to constraints or challenges that are encoun-
tered [ 3], and may or may not be aligned with the elements
o ft h ei n t e r v e n t i o nt h a tm a k ei te f f e c t i v e[ 2,4].

Recommended elements of reporting w ere as follows: (1) when and how in the implementatio n process the modification was made, (2) whether the
modification was planned/proactive (i.e., an adaptation) or unplanned/r eactive, (3) who determined that the modification should be made, (4) what is
modified, (5) at what level of delivery the modification is made, (6) type or n ature of context or content-level modifications, (7) the extent to which the
modification is fidelity-consistent, and (8) the re asons for the modification, including (a) the int ent or goal of the modification (e.g., cultural adaptations, to
reduce costs, etc.) and (b) contextual factors that influenced the decis ion. Adapted from (Bauman n A, Cabassa LJ & Stirman SW, 2017; Stirman SW, Mille rC J ,
Toder K & Calloway A, 2013)Wiltsey Stirman et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:58 Page 4 of 10
Adaptations are typically m ade proactively through a
planning process that identif ies ways to maximize fit and
implementation success while m inimizing disruption of the
intervention [ 10]. However, due to the reactive nature of
other modifications, we added a specifier to the framework
to capture whether modifications were planned prior to de-
livery (i.e., an adaptation), or unplanned and made in
response to an unanticipated challenge. It is important to
note that iterative changes are not necessarily reactive —it-
eration can accommodate unan ticipated challenges. For
example, a modification made during the “Act”portion of a
“Plan-do-study-act ”cycle would not be considered reactive,
because it was determined through a systematic process ra-
ther than through improvisation.
Who determined the modification
The driver of change, and how participatory the decision
was, may be important predictors of whether the changes
have the desired impact. The FRAME can be used to list
all who play a role in the decision, but in some contexts, it
may be important to specify who makes the ultimate deci-
sion, as this detail might affect whether and how wide-
spread the modification may occur. It may also be closely
linked to reasons for modification. For example, adminis-
trators ’decisions to modify an EBP may be related to re-
strictions in sourcing or contracting while policymakers ’
decisions may be in response to political factors or funding
availability. Modifications made by individual providers
may respond to recipient-level needs or local constraints
that may not be visible to policymakers.
What is modified
The original 2013 framework [ 16]f o c u s e dl a r g e l yo nc h a r -
acterizing what types of changes were made to facilitate un-
derstanding of which changes are associated with
implementation success and recipient-level outcomes.
Much of this component of the framework remains un-
changed, although we added implementation and scale-up
activities to reflect that thes e processes may differ across
contexts. If little about the in tervention were changed, but
the implementation strategies d iffered significantly across
otherwise similar contexts, then differences in outcomes
m a yb ea t t r i b u t a b l et od i f f e r e n c e si nh o wt h ei n t e r v e n t i o n
was implemented.
At what level of delivery the modification is made
Codes for the level of delivery also remain mostly un-
changed from the 2013 framework. Reporting the level at
which modifications occur has implications for under-
standing whether and under what circumstances implica-
tion success or effectiveness are associated with making
individual-level modificat ions, and when modifications
may need to be applied more broadly. The FRAME now
differentiates the entire target group (e.g., women who areat risk of developing diabetes) and individual sub-groups
(e.g., new mothers who are at risk of developing diabetes),
a sm o d i f i c a t i o n sm a yb em a d ef o rb r o a do rs p e c i f i cg r o u p s
depending on the circumstances.
Type or nature content-level modifications
Although many items in this section are unchanged from
the original framework, items were added to reflect a larger
variety of modifications identi fied through the literature,
ongoing observational work (c.f., [ 1,3,20,21,23,48]), and
stakeholder interviews. For example, it may be important to
understand whether drift occurs for a relatively brief period
of time before returning to a protocol or whether it occurs
for the duration of a meeting or session, without a return
to planned content. Additionally, spreading out psycho-
social or educational content intended for a single meeting
or session over multiple sessions was added, as this may
occur when an individual requi res more time to understand
content or when unforeseen or emergent issues need to be
addressed during a given session.
The relationship to fidelity
In previous work, we have made a distinction between
fidelity-consistent and fidelity-inconsistent modifications.
Fidelity-consistent modifications are defined as those that
preserve core elements of a treatment that are needed for
the intervention to be effective [ 49]. In contrast, fidelity-in-
consistent modifications are those that alter the interven-
tion in a manner that fails to preserve its core elements.
The identification of fidelity-consistent and fidelity-incon-
sistent modifications can be made in consultation with the
existing literature, input from the treatment developer, and
any available evaluation data. Others have suggested that
the function of intervention elements be prioritized over
the form, such that what is core to the intervention is con-
ceptualized as one of several possible activities or materials
that accomplish a core int ervention function (e.g., educa-
tion, skill building, connecting to supports or resources)
[50].
When implementing an intervention with a population
that differs in important wa ys from the populations with
which the intervention has been tested and implemented,
new understanding of which elements are core vs. periph-
eral may emerge. For example, a component intended to
improve basic health literacy may be essential for one
population, but less necessary for a population that has a
solid foundation of specific health information. Moreover, it
may not be known whether some modifications, such as
preserving the original spacing of sessions or activities,
would have an impact on outcomes, and there may not be
theory to inform decisions about such modifications either
way. We have therefore added an “unknown ”code that canWiltsey Stirman et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:58 Page 5 of 10
be used when there is no theory or evidence to inform a de-
cision about whether an element is core vs. peripheral.
The rationale for the modifications made
The additions related to the rationale for modifications
represent the most significant enhancements to the ori-
ginal framework. Capturing the rationale for a given
modification may be crucial in determining links to key
implementation or health outcomes [ 20]. For example,
modifications made to cut costs may have a very differ-
ent impact than those made to improve fit or engage-
ment. Thus, we specify the goal for modification —to
improve feasibility or acceptability, to increase reach or
engagement, to improve fit (note that cultural modifica-
tions intended to improve fit are assigned a subcategory
under this goal), to reduce costs, to improve clinical out-
comes, or to align the intervention with cultural values,
norms, or priorities.
To identify reasons to modify EBPs for FRAME, we re-
ferred to existing reviews and original literature that enu-
merated reasons for specific projects and implementation
frameworks that specified potential determinants at differ-
ent levels. We specifically added cultural modifications
within the FRAME due to the importance of cultural
modifications in implementation science. Attention to cul-
tural factors is important in investigating modifications to
EBPs because of its potential consequences in terms of
healthcare disparities [ 15]. Cultural adaptation can be de-
fined as the systematic modification of an intervention to
“consider language, culture, and context in such a way
that it is compatible with the client ’s cultural patterns,
meanings, and values ”[35]. Focusing on culture allows us
to expand the characterization of content modifications
(e.g., whether content is added, removed, or tailored) and
context-level modifications (e.g., whether personnel, train-
ing, or education are modified) to explicitly address cul-
tural patterns or values at the client, provider, or
sociopolitical level. Designation of cultural or religious
norms at the organizational level distinguish adaptations
made to distinguish this form of culture from the con-
struct of organizational culture used in the implementa-
tion and organization literature to signify “the way things
are done in an organization ”[51]. At times, cultural or re-
ligious beliefs may contribute to organizational culture or
policies, but the constructs do not fully overlap.
By explicitly defining cultural aspects and determinants
that affect inequities in care delivery, we hope to identify
the types of modifications made to address cultural as-
pects of the populations included in our studies. Thus, we
also examine, more broadly, factors at the recipient, pro-
vider, organizational, and socio-political levels that are ex-
amples of important components that affect the
modifications of the EBPs.Socio-political factors m a ya l s ob ei m p o r t a n td e t e r m i -
nants of modifications to EBPs captured in the FRAME.
For example, socio-historical factors such as stigma at-
tached to receiving mental health treatment may require
modifications so that interventions are instead delivered by
spiritual leaders or peers, or in settings that are more com-
fortable for members of a community. Existing laws and
policies can impact whether aspects of an intervention are
removed due to constraints (e.g., telephone check-ins may
be removed if they cannot be reimbursed; licensure restric-
tions for telehealth across state lines) and may also result
in adaptations to personnel or setting.
At the organizational level , we found that factors that
may lead to modifications overlap somewhat with those
found in existing determinant frameworks (e.g., [ 41,
52]). For example, staffing shortages may suggest a var-
iety of context modifications. This may include delivery
by different personnel (e.g., providers from a different
discipline) or changes to the format or timing of deliv-
ery. Such staffing shortages may also affect training or
evaluation of the intervention. For example, implemen-
tation may require streamlining training sessions, adapt-
ing them to fit with providers ’previous training, or
spreading them over several weeks to accommodate
busy clinic schedules.
Other practical constraints play a role in decisions to
adapt or modify interventions [ 2,15,19,23]. Space short-
ages may indicate the need for context modifications (e.g.,
changing from group to individual delivery). In contexts
without easily accessed health centers, community-, home-,
or telehealth-based delivery formats, there may be context-
ual adaptations to address d emand or need. Limitations to
available technology can have far-reaching implications as
well as it may require removal or adaptation of aspects of
the original intervention that can be delivered in
under-resourced settings. Ti me constraints may lead to re-
moving elements or compre ssing the intervention.
Aspects of organizational/setting (including local com-
munity if not delivered in a healthcare setting) culture may
also impact how interventions are delivered. Competing de-
mands, de-prioritization of an intervention, or high rates of
turnover may lead to changes in who delivers the interven-
tion, how many sessions or elements are provided, and
whether and how training is provided. Regulatory or com-
pliance issues or legal concerns may lead to certain aspects
of an intervention not being delivered (e.g., limits to the
types of physical activity or activities that may occur
off-premises). An organizational culture that has long es-
poused a different theory or intervention may leave pro-
viders wary of new practices and lead to integration of
elements of interventions into existing practices rather than
de-implementation of preferred practices [ 53]. In sum,
organizational/s etting factors —including organizational
culture and available resources —may necessitate a varietyWiltsey Stirman et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:58 Page 6 of 10
of modifications even to interventions with a strong evi-
d e n c eb a s ei ns p e c i f i cc o n t e x t s .
At the provider level , there has been discussion around
the positive or negative consequences of modifying in-
terventions to fit with provider preferences or to im-
prove the interaction between providers and their clients
[1]. Providers of psychosocial interventions frequently
modify interventions for a variety of reasons, including
perceived client preferences, providers ’preferences or
self-efficacy [ 54], and efforts to maintain a good thera-
peutic alliance [ 55–58]. Factors such as provider gender
and cultural beliefs may also impact decisions about de-
livery of the intervention. Additionally, some provider
factors, such as previous training and experience, may
lead to changes to training and evaluation.
Recipient level factors are also identified in Fig. 1. Each
identified factor may contribute to a need for modification
to promote optimal levels of engagement and outcomes at
different levels. For example, limited transportation might
make face to face meetings in a clinic difficult, which
could lead to modifications in the format (e.g., telephone
or internet-based) or setting (home-based). On the other
hand, low literacy might make full engagement in an inter-
vention that relies on written materials difficult and
require tailoring to deliver content to clients in other for-
mats. Other aspects, such as cultural norms, legal status,
or physical capacity, may necessitate the removal or alter-
ation of some elements of the EBP.
Limitations
Although our approach to refining the framework is unique
in its use of multiple data sour ces and stakeholder input,
some limitations are important to describe. We did not em-
ploy a systematic review or a traditional thematic analysis
because these approaches did not fully align with the
current project goals. While i t is possible that additional
items would have been identified through these processes,
our use of a “stop rule ”, stakeholder feedback, and coding
of subsequent articles using t he FRAME after consolidating
information from all of our data sources suggested that the
framework was sufficie ntly comprehensive.
Furthermore, stakeholders identified a need to balance
comprehensiveness with feasibility and pragmatism in
documentation and reporting. The feasibility of using a
comprehensive framework is likely to differ across re-
search and applied settings. We must also acknowledge
that comprehensively cataloging modifications to EBPs
may be difficult in some contexts even with a
well-developed framework like the FRAME. For example,
if an intervention has not been exhaustively described and
tested —as is frequently the case in healthcare —then it
may be impossible to reliably detect adaptations and their
associated consequences. In these cases, the FRAME willonly be as useful as the data informing its application.
Evaluation of different approaches to using the FRAME
for documentation is needed to inform efforts to achieve
the appropriate balance.
Recommendations and future directions in reporting
Several strategies for reporting adaptations and modifica-
tions that may be applicable to the FRAME have been de-
veloped and described in the literature. In this section, we
discuss the advantages and drawbacks to these strategies.
Observation
To identify modifications that are made during routine
treatment delivery, Stirman and colleagues developed the
Modification and Adaptation Checklist (MAC; [ 59]), an ob-
servational coding system int ended to be used in conjunc-
tion with fidelity assessments. Observation, the “gold
standard ”f o rf i d e l i t yc o d i n g ,m a yb eu s e f u lw h e np r o v i d e r s
may not realize they are making content modifications or
when they have difficulty recalling, identifying, or describ-
ing which modifications they made. It may be particularly
useful in contexts in which providers may be reluctant to
report modifications such as drift or removing key inter-
vention elements. However, observation is not feasible in
many contexts as it is labor intensive and would require fa-
miliarity with the FRAME and t he intervention. Intermit-
tent observation, although more feasible, might lead
investigators to miss certain forms of modification, such as
extending a protocol or repeating material in a session or
encounter that is not observed [ 1]. Furthermore, without
additional information from sta keholders, the rationale for
making a modification cannot be confirmed.
Provider or key informant self-report
A self-report version of the MAC includes both
content-level modifications and brief questions about for-
mat, level of delivery, and reasons for modification. The
reasons for modification are less detailed than those in-
cluded in the FRAME. However, space for details about the
specific contextual factors that were considered or that led
to modification can allow for free responses that can be
coded. Self-report may be more feasible when frequent as-
sessment is required, although it may entail greater burden
on providers than participati ng in a one-time interview or
having encounters observed. Providers may over-report
some forms of modification (c.f., [ 56]), while underreport-
ing others. In fact, at times, providers may not recognize
that they are modifying the interventions or whether adap-
tations are fidelity-consistent o r fidelity-inconsistent. Core
elements and functions of the intervention may not be fully
established, making it challenging to report these aspects.
These challenges may be heightened when modifications
are not tracked in real-time, and reporting may be subject
to recall bias, or when training has not been sufficient toWiltsey Stirman et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:58 Page 7 of 10
promote awareness of fidelity. Additionally, incentives and
contingencies may be present that impact reporting of
modification and fidelity to an intervention.
Despite these limitations, self-report measures may be
the most feasible strategy for real-time reporting of
modifications that occur during implementation and
sustainment phases. However, many of the context mod-
ifications that are reported can be validated through
other forms of documentation. It remains to be deter-
mined whether self-report and observer ratings agree,
and the optimal frequency for self-report. Additionally,
it is unclear whether self-reports are more informative
and accurate as global self-assessments (e.g., inquiring
which interventions a provider has made over a given
period of time) or for a single encounter or time point
(e.g., focusing assessments on which intervention a pro-
vider used for a single encounter). Recent and ongoing
research are attempting to address these types of ques-
tions [ 22,38].
Interviews
Interviews may provide richer data than provider check-
lists or observation of single encounters, although they
may be subject to similar biases as self-report. They allow
an understanding of who made the ultimate decision to
modify, the level of delivery, reasons for adaptation, and
contextual factors that were considered. We developed a
codebook for our original framework [ 16] to allow investi-
gators to operationalize and identify modifications that
were made to interventions during the implementation
process. It was originally used for coding articles in the lit-
erature [ 16] and interviews with community-based clini-
cians [ 56] and has since been used in a variety of contexts
[20–23]. Interview guides based on an expanded code-
book can be used to facilitate understanding of the eight
FRAME elements. For example, Rabin and colleagues re-
cently described a measurement system that expanded the
Stirman et al. 2013 framework to include RE-AIM con-
cepts, framed as Who ,How,When ,What ,a n d Why ?[20].
A potential drawback to interviews is that they may not be
feasible to administer frequently due to the time required
for interviews and coding.
Differing forms of assessment will need to be com-
pared to assess accuracy and reliability, and factors such
as burden on stakeholders and research participants will
need to be considered in determining the best assess-
ment strategy for a given project. For some interven-
tions, modifications may be most reliably identified
through self-report checklists (with sufficient descrip-
tions of each adaptation to facilitate reliable reporting)
that are completed soon after the intervention is deliv-
ered, while others may be best identified through de-
tailed interviews with stakeholders. Triangulation of
strategies may be necessary when modifications are noteasily observed and to better assess reasons for modifi-
cation. For example, Rabin et al. [ 20] used observational
data in addition to interviews to construct intervention
process maps and identify additional contextual factors
that may be relevant to adaptation.
Future directions and research agenda
Measurement and reporting
While attention to modification has greatly increased in
the past decade, the science of measurement and report-
ing remains nascent. Strategies for reporting and measure-
ment have not yet been empirically compared, nor have
psychometric properties of self-reports been examined.
When used for research, detailed versions of a FRAME
measure can facilitate comprehensive reporting and ana-
lyses. For the most precise coding, the FRAME figure it-
self could be used for each separate modification that was
identified, with the reporter or interviewer circling the
appropriate selection in each of the sections. However, ele-
ments that do not apply in a given context could be re-
moved to streamline reporting and evaluation in routine
care contexts. As with sustainability [ 44], it is unlikely that
assessment of modification at a single time point will re-
flect the dynamic process of implementation [ 7]. Assess-
ment at multiple time points will provide a richer
understanding of why, how, and with what impact modifi-
cation occurs in complex systems.
Linking and understanding modifications and outcomes
Ultimately, the FRAME is intended to facilitate understand-
ing of associations between the process, types, and reasons
that interventions are modified and key outcomes. Over
time, such research may identify which aspects of the
FRAME are particularly important to attend to when plan-
ning and documenting adaptations. Key outcomes to con-
sider include increased, decreased, or unchanged levels of
reach, diagnostic outcomes, en gagement, or acceptability.
However, in designing analyses to examine whether modifi-
cations may lead to differences in outcomes, it is important
not to confound the impact of potential moderating factors
that inspired the modification (e.g., comorbidity) with the
impact of the modification itself.
We developed and reviewed some study methodologies,
summarized elsewhere [ 1,15], that can facilitate prospect-
ive research on modifications. We also reviewed experi-
mental, prospective invest igations of adaptations [ 1], but
many of the adaptations and combinations thereof that
occur in settings in which interventions routinely occur
have not been represented. Methods to tease apart the im-
pact of individual modificatio ns when they frequently occur
in conjunction with multiple others remain to be developed
and may require large samples. Chambers and Norton [ 60]
suggest the development of a database in which data fromWiltsey Stirman et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:58 Page 8 of 10
multiple projects can be pooled, using a common tax-
onomy, to facilitate more rapid understanding of what ad-
aptations are necessary or effect ive for similar interventions
when delivered to different populations or in different
contexts. Within efforts to implement or scale-up across
multiple sites, strategies such as qualitative comparative
analysis may identify combina tions of contextual factors
and adaptations that associated with outcomes.
Conclusion
Much work remains to be done to develop generalized
knowledge about the process, nature, and outcomes of
modifications made to different types of interventions in
vastly different contexts. The FRAME is intended to cap-
ture information that reflects the complex and dynamic set-
tings in which implementati on occurs. Documenting with
the FRAME can facilitate more rigorous study that includes
efforts not only to characterize adaptations themselves, but
also to clarify the timing, context, and process of modifying
interventions to facilitate their implementation, scale-up,
spread, and sustainment.
