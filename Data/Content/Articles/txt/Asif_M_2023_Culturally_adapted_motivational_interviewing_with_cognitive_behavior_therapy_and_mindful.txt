Abstract 
Background The use of psychoactive substances significantly impacts the health, social and economic aspects of 
families, communities and nations. There is a need to develop and test psychological interventions aimed for individu‑
als with substance use disorder (SUD) in lower ‑ and middle ‑income countries (LMICs), such as in Pakistan. The aim of 
this exploratory trial is to test the feasibility and acceptability of two culturally adapted psychological interventions in 
a factorial randomised controlled trial (RCT).
Methods The proposed project will be conducted in three phases. The first phase of the study will focus on cul‑
tural adaptation of the interventions through qualitative interviews with key stakeholders. The second phase will be 
to refine and produce manually assisted interventions. Third and last stage would be to assess the feasibility of the 
culturally adapted interventions through a factorial RCT. The study will be carried out in Karachi, Hyderabad, Peshawar, 
Lahore and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Recruitment of participants will take place from primary care and volunteer organi‑
sations/drug rehabilitation centres. A total of 260 individuals diagnosed with SUD (n = 65) in each of the four arms will 
be recruited. The intervention will be delivered weekly over a period of 12 weeks in both individual and group set ‑
tings. Assessments will be carried out at baseline, at 12th week (after completion of intervention) and 24th week post ‑
randomisation. The analysis will determine the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, retention and intervention 
delivery. Acceptability of intervention will be determined in terms of adherence to intervention, i.e. the mean number 
of sessions attended, number of home assignments completed, attrition rates, as well as through process evaluation 
to understand the implementation process, context, participants’ satisfaction, and impact of the study intervention. 
The health resource use and impact on the quality of life will be established through health economic data.

Background
The use of psychoactive substances significantly impacts 
the health, social and economic aspects of families, com -
munities and nations. In 2019, approximately 275 million 
people worldwide used illicit substances with almost half 
a million deaths related to substance misuse [1 ]. Sub -
stance misuse has resulted in 18 million years of healthy 
life lost [1 ]. Substance misuse has increased 22 percent in 
last 10 years and it is thought that the number of people 
using illicit substance will increase further 11% by 2030 
[1]. According to the World Drug Report [2 ], only 1 out of 
8 people receive the required treatment for substance mis -
use. In Pakistan, 7.6 million people use illicit substances 
and approximately 4.25 million people are dependent [3 ] 
with 50,000 more people becoming dependent on illicit 
substances each year [4 ]. This calls for urgent attention 
and treatment approaches for individuals with SUD [3 ]. 
In Pakistan, there is a higher prevalence of substance mis -
use amongst men compared to women [5 ]. Amongst men, 
cannabis and opioids have been the most used substances 
[5]. Heroin is consumed more in Pakistan than in any 
other country in the South Asian region [5 ]. In women, 
there is a higher prevalence of prescription opioids, tran -
quilizers and sedatives misuse [3 ].
Previous history of substance use, lack of family support 
and stress have been reported as underpinned associations 
of relapse [6 ]. Though there are strong religious and cultural 
objections to substance use, it is a highly prevalent problem 
amongst the youth of Pakistan. These findings suggest an 
increased burden on public health resources. The major -
ity of people who use illicit substances belong to the poor 
strata of the society [3 ]. With most detoxification centres 
in Pakistan being operated by non-governmental organiza -
tions (NGOs), access to treatment is limited. Around 75% 
of people dependent on opiates are left without an avenue 
to seek help (Bureau of International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement Affairs [7 ]. It is therefore necessary to address 
needs of this population in order to provide effective and 
targeted interventions.
Evidence suggests that psychological interventions such 
as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Motivational 
Interviewing (MI) and Relapse Prevention (RP) interven -
tions are effective treatments for substance misuse [8 ]. CBT is considered as the most effective psychological 
treatment for SUD [9 , 10]. The CBT approach comprises 
of different types of interventions [11] such as CBT based 
MI [12], mindfulness based stress reduction [13], Mind -
fulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) [14] which 
can either be combined or used as standalone interven -
tions. Although, CBT focuses on unpleasant or distressing 
events, thoughts and actions, different approaches of CBT 
may aim to reduce the impact of internal triggers and pro -
mote coping skills to maintain abstinence in the long term 
[15]. For example, CBT-based MI (MICBT) for substance 
misuse focus on improving motivation to change (to 
improve access and engagement with the services) and on 
prevention of relapse. MI is effective in improving motiva -
tion to change [16] and to produce significant change in 
multiple substance related outcomes [17– 19]. The addi -
tion of MI assessment has been shown to increase engage -
ment and adherence to overall treatment [20].
In addition to MICBT, RP is another commonly used 
CBT intervention for SUDs developed to help clients main -
tain abstinence by identifying internal and external triggers 
and promoting effective coping skills that increase self-
efficacy in managing triggers and reduce the risk of relapse 
[20]. Furthermore, MBRP is an extension of CBT-based RP 
approach that focuses on identifying triggers, thoughts and 
cravings, automatic reactions to those triggers, and using 
mindfulness as a way of effectively coping with situations 
that may trigger relapse [21, 22]. Mindfulness-based inter -
ventions have been increasingly developed and evaluated 
for the treatment of SUD [23]. Although, CBT and its dif -
ferent approaches, i.e., MICBT and MBRP have shown to 
be effective interventions for substance misuse, these are 
widely used in high-income countries [24] and there is high 
degree of heterogeneity as reported in a previous system -
atic review [25]. So, the evidence of the efficacy of MICBT 
and MBRP for SUD in LMICs  is scarce. There is also an 
identified need to culturally adapt CBT for LMICs [10]. In 
Pakistan, there has been very little research in this area.
Study aims and objectives
The study aims to culturally adapt and integrate two 
CBT approaches, MICBT and MBRP intervention 
for individuals with SUDs in Pakistan and to test the

feasibility and acceptability of these interventions in a 
factorial RCT.
Methods
Study design and setting
This will be a four-arm feasibility factorial RCT. An 
overview of complete study design is provided in Fig.  1. 
The proposed project will consist of three phases. The 
first phase of the study will focus on the adaptation/development of the intervention in accordance with the 
Pakistani culture. The second phase will include refine -
ment of the interventions and production of the inter -
vention manuals. The third phase will be to assess the 
feasibility through a factorial RCT. The study will be car -
ried out in Karachi, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Lahore and 
Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Recruitment of participants will 
be from primary care and volunteer organisations/drug 
rehabilitation centres.

Phase 1: intervention adaptation/development
The first stage of the study will comprise of focus groups 
and in-depth interviews with service users and other 
stakeholders. The purpose of this phase is the cultural 
adaptation of the evidence-based MICBT [12, 26, 27] and 
MBRP [28, 29] for the study population. Through quali -
tative work, the culturally adapted intervention will be 
developed for people with SUD, as well as an accompa -
nying manual. Focus groups will be conducted with key 
stakeholder groups including (1) service users, (2) family 
members/carers, (3) health professionals and (4) Com -
munity leaders, religious scholars (Imams) (8–10 in each 
group; total sample n = 32–40). We will also conduct 1:1 
individual interviews if participant is not willing for focus 
group discussion.
There will be active selection of participants in order to 
represent the wider population. Focus group interviews 
will be conducted by a trained research assistant, last -
ing between 60 and 90 min—including the time for set -
ting up and addressing participants’ queries. The topic 
guide will be developed in collaboration with the mem -
bers from the service user and carer’s advisory group. 
For consistency, the same topic guide will be used with 
participants who prefer individual interviews. Data will 
be analysed using thematic analysis [30] for emergent 
themes relevant to the cultural adaptation of MICBT and 
MBRP . The following areas will be considered specifically 
(1) experiences with the services, (2) opinions on the cul -
tural adaptation of MICBT and MBRP intervention, (3) 
identifying and understanding barriers limiting access to 
services, and (4) opinions on how best to involve family 
in the treatment plan. Our group has culturally adapted 
interventions for a range of mental disorders using mixed 
methods in Pakistan and the UK and we will follow same 
procedures described elsewhere [31–39].
Phase 2: test run and intervention refinement
Phase 2 will involve preliminary testing of the cultur -
ally adapted intervention in a small group of partici -
pants. Cultural adaptation of the intervention requires 
an understanding of the religious and socio-cultural 
constructs of the population. This will take into consid -
eration the explanatory models of any illness, along with 
understanding of underlying beliefs and values [31]. Such 
adaptations are reported to increase the acceptability and 
uptake of psychological and social interventions. Once 
the cultural adaptation is complete, a sample of 12 partic -
ipants diagnosed with SUD will be invited to participate 
in the test run of the intervention. This will consist of 8 
individual and 4 group sessions focusing on distinct yet 
related stages: exploring motivation to change; explor -
ing the process of change; identifying strategies to con -
solidate commitment to change, explore effective coping skills, increase awareness and development of flexible 
responding in the presence of triggers of relapse. Feed -
back will be gathered from the participants, therapists 
and staff, on the relevance and acceptability of the cul -
turally adapted interventions. All participants of trial run 
will be invited to be interviewed to explore their opinions 
on intervention relevance and acceptability. All inter -
views will be carried out by researchers from outside the 
local community in order to further protect interviewee 
confidentiality. These interviews will be recorded and 
transcribed. The interview guide will include some pre -
determined questions (based on findings from phase 1) 
and some open-ended questions to facilitate emergence 
of new themes.
Phase 3: feasibility factorial RCT 
The feasibility of the intervention will be assessed using 
a factorial RCT, for MICBT and MBRP intervention, 
comparing four groups: (1) MICBT plus treatment as 
usual group (TAU), (2) MBRP plus TAU group, (3) the 
integrated MICBT and MBRP with TAU and (4) TAU 
group alone. In Pakistani culture, people consider them -
selves more as part of a family and larger community 
rather than as individuals. Therefore, a group approach is 
more culturally appropriate but for certain private/fam -
ily issues the flexibility of some individual time with the 
therapists will be offered. The group sessions will consist 
of approximately eight participants.
Eligibility criteria
Participants meeting DSM-V criteria for SUD, aged 
18  years and above, understand spoken Urdu and have 
completed the detoxification process (to ensure engage -
ment in the intervention) will be included. Exclusions 
will be made if there will be any evidence of organic brain 
disease, clinically significant co-occurring medical illness 
or mental illness to the extent that can prevent participa -
tion in the intervention. A trained research assistant (RA) 
will confirm participants’ eligibility against inclusion/
exclusion criteria and obtain informed consent.
Interventions
Explanation for the choice of comparators
MI is being increasingly blended with treatments such 
as CBT to enhance intrinsic motivation for behavioural 
change and found to have positive outcomes [40]; how -
ever, further research is required to replicate these 
findings in LMICs such as Pakistan. Similarly, a recent 
review of 54 RCTs supports efficacy of mindfulness-
based interventions for SUDs and RP [29]. However, the 
review also calls for more rigorous research designs with 
longer follow-up periods [29]. The review concluded that 
the most effective intervention approach to target SUD 
Page 5 of 11
 Asif et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:67 
 
is to combine mindfulness interventions with treatment-
as-usual (TAU) or other active treatments. Another 
review by Garland and Howard [41] has also provided 
strong recommendations for the next wave of research 
to firmly establish the efficacy of mindfulness interven -
tions for SUD.
Intervention description
CBT‑based Motivational Interviewing (MICBT)
The culturally adapted MICBT [26, 27] includes 
approaches of CBT based motivational interviewing. 
MI is a well-developed intervention for exploring and 
resolving the ambivalence to change behaviour. MICBT 
[27] includes techniques to increase and consolidate 
motivation to make positive changes in individuals 
with problematic substance use, cognitive restructur -
ing, learning assertiveness and problem solving skills 
combined with cognitive behavioural relapse preven -
tion approaches. The cognitive behavioural model of 
substance use suggests that problematic substance use 
is maintained by thoughts of reduced ability to cope 
when faced with high-risk situations. Beliefs regarding 
inability to cope with difficulties interact with physio -
logical cravings and psychological urges to use. During 
this time, the decision to use or continue to use sub -
stances is made. Relief from cravings and urges occur 
and reinforce the belief that substance use is the only 
way to manage such situations. This intervention will 
focus on ambivalence to change substance use behav -
iour. This will also identify and help solve difficulties in 
changing substance use behaviour by offering ways of 
managing these difficulties through CBT.
Mindfulness based Relapse Prevention (MBRP)
MBRP [28] incorporates mindfulness-based practices 
with cognitive-behavioural skills to reduce likelihood 
of relapse, increase awareness and flexible responding 
towards triggers of SUD. Rationale of MBRP practices 
is its explicit emphasis to increase awareness to external 
triggers and discrete emotional, behavioural and cogni -
tive reaction patterns are focused during initial sessions 
of intervention [28]. Exercises and practices explore the 
functions of habitual behaviours such as substance mis -
use and focus on the balance between acceptance of 
present moment and skilful action to bring real change. 
Moreover, MBRP put emphasis on association of thought 
content and relapse cycle and encouraged to focus on 
thoughts simply as thoughts and not essentially as reality. 
The latter sessions of MBRP centre on sustainability of 
learned skills in daily life, and to identifying or establish 
access to resources to strengthen supportive social net -
works [28].CAMIAB intervention
This will be MICBT integrated with MBRP intervention. 
The interventions will be manualised and will include 
both individual as well as group sessions.
Treatment As Usual (TAU)
We will carefully record the routine care treatment that 
the participants will be receiving.
The intervention will be delivered alongside TAU 
in all study arms and participants will not be asked to 
cease any practices that they are currently undertaking 
on either control or intervention arm. Existing services 
received will be monitored and recorded throughout the 
trial. Intervention sessions will be delivered according to 
adapted intervention manuals. Manually assisted inter -
ventions help standardise the intervention in different 
settings and benefit in monitoring intervention fidelity.
Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated 
interventions
The study interventions outlined are not expected to 
cause any adverse effects nor there is any anticipated 
harm to come from study participation. However, par -
ticipants will be free to withdraw from the study at any 
point. The intervention will be discontinued if any indi -
vidual participant requests to withdraw from the study or 
if any adverse effects warrant terminating the interven -
tion. Given that this is a feasibility study, there will be 
no modifications in allocated treatments but a process 
evaluation will be undertaken to refine the intervention 
for a future definitive trial. After completion of inter -
vention session, participants in need of further clinical 
interventions or who have not responded to intervention 
and those in TAU group will be referred to appropriate 
services.
Strategies to improve adherence to interventions
Intervention sessions will be delivered according to 
adapted manuals and the intervention adherence will be 
monitored by number of sessions attended. The interven -
tion will be delivered by trained therapist in supervision 
of senior therapist who have training and experience in 
conducting psychological interventions for SUD.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: feasibility indicators
Feasibility will be determined by following indicators:
• Recruitment rates, attendance (number of sessions 
attended), retention rate and randomisation.
• Acceptability of interventions based on client sat -
isfaction, adherence rate (the number of sessions 
Page 6 of 11 Asif et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:67 
attended, number of home assignments completed) 
and attrition rates.
• Completeness of assessment by participants.
Meeting the progression criteria of > 50% of recruit -
ment, > 70% of retention, > 60% of attendance, > 70% of 
adherence, < 30% of attrition and > 70% of assessment 
completion at study end will determine that a full defini -
tive trial is needed.
Secondary outcomes
The Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP) [42] is a brief 
questionnaire to measure problems in four domains that 
include substance use, health risk behaviour, physical and 
psychological health, and personal/social functions.
The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being 
Scale (SWEMWBS) [42] will be used to measure mental wellbeing. It consists of 7 statements on a 5-point Likert 
scale. The minimum scale score is 7 and the maximum is 
35. The high score indicates better mental wellbeing.
Quality of Life [43] This will be measured using Euro -
QoL (EQ-5D) a standardised instrument to measure 
health outcomes and quality of life.
Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [44] will be used 
to estimate the health and social services received.
Study procedure
The study procedure is outlined in Fig.  1 and in the 
Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Inter -
ventional Trials (SPIRIT) diagram (Table  1). A completed 
SPIRIT checklist is given as Additional file 1.
Sample size
Based on the recommendations by Sim and Lewis [45], 
a minimum sample size of at least 50 participants per 
Table 1 Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) diagram
Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments

 Asif et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:67 
 
group is required for feasibility studies. Assuming 30% 
attrition rate, we aim to recruit a total of N = 260 par -
ticipants, with 65 participants randomised to each arm 
according to 2 × 2 factorial design scheduled in given 
Table 2.
The findings of this feasibility study will help determine 
the initial data for the outcome measures and will help in 
providing a sample size estimate for a larger future defini -
tive trial; therefore, no formal power calculations have 
been undertaken.
Recruitment
Participants will be recruited from primary care and 
volunteer organisations/drug rehabilitation centres in 
Pakistan. A detailed Participant Information Sheet (PIS) 
about the study will be provided to all interested partici -
pants. Objectives as well as risks and benefits of partici -
pation will be detailed by a trained RA in local language. 
Participants eligible for study participation will be given 
at least 48  h to discuss with their family and to decide 
whether or not to take part. Those willing to participate 
will complete consent process and baseline assessments 
within 1 week of consent.
Intervention allocation
Sequence generation
Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the four 
intervention arms by an independent offsite statistician 
using a computer-generated random sequence based on 
a block randomised design [46] until all study data are 
collected and verified. Once randomised, participants 
will be allocated a unique study identification number 
and informed about their intervention allocated groups 
within 1 week of randomisation.
Concealment mechanism
The independent statistician will share the randomised 
list of participants with the trial manager and he/she will 
further communicate the allocation information to thera -
pists. It would not be possible to blind the staff deliver -
ing intervention and participants to treatment allocation 
but outcome assessments at each follow-up will be con -
ducted by research staff blind to intervention groups. 
The therapist will advise participants not to discuss their intervention allocation with researchers doing outcome 
assessments.
Blinding
Those administering assessments at baseline and follow-
ups, data entry, and data analysis will be blind to inter -
vention groups. During the trial, periodic data quality 
checks will be carried out by the trial statistician. The 
trial statistician will be blinded to intervention alloca -
tions. Upon completion of data entry, preliminary data 
analysis will be carried out prior to un-blinding.
Data collection method
All participants (intervention and TAU groups) will 
undergo assessments at baseline, 3rd month (end of 
intervention) and at 6th month after randomisation. 
Participants will complete a self- report demographic 
information sheet (only at baseline) that will collect 
information related to age, duration of substance mis -
use, type of substance used etc., the MAP [47], SWEM -
WBS [42], EuroQoL (EQ-5D) [43] and CSRI [44]. All the 
assessments will be carried out by trained research assis -
tants at baseline, 3rd month (end of intervention) and at 
6th month.
Plans to promote participant retention and complete 
follow‑up
Recruitment and retention are both an integral part of 
any drug and alcohol misuse trial due to the highly cha -
otic nature of this disorder. To increase retention of par -
ticipants, protocols developed by Scott [48] will be used, 
where locater information will be recorded for each par -
ticipant. Scott [48] achieved 95% retention of participants 
in his study on alcohol abuse. The study team will have 
regular contact with participants throughout the study 
period. Participants in the TAU group will be contacted 
by RA on weekly basis for first 3 months of the study to 
keep them engaged and retain in the study as well as to 
keep them well informed of the study’s progress. Both 
groups will be contacted monthly from 3 to 6 months to 
promote retention to the study. These contacts maybe 
done via a brief 5-min phone call.
Data management
The data will be collected by trained RA’s to maintain 
confidentiality and anonymity. Only essential personal 
identifiable data will be collected in consent forms. 
Study data will be stored according to the General Data 
Protection Regulations 2018, with personal identifiable 
data secured separately. Electronic data will be stored in 
password protected computers. Demographic and ques -
tionnaire data will be anonymised immediately after 
collection and inputted into a study-specific password Table 2 2 × 2 Factorial design schedule of intervention with

protected database. Paper copies of questionnaires and 
consent forms will be stored in locked cabinets. Per -
sonal identifiable data will be kept locked away, separate 
from other research data. Access to both hard copies and 
electronic versions of data will be restricted to only des -
ignated persons as approved by the site principal inves -
tigator (PI). A signed duty log will be used to access the 
data.
Confidentiality
Participant’s confidentiality will be protected by assign -
ing a unique study number and use of pseudonyms on 
all research material, e.g., transcripts. Reporting of ver -
batim quotations in presentations and publications will 
be carefully reviewed by the research team in advance. 
Paraphrasing will be used if there is any risk of identifi -
cation of participants or third parties. The participants 
would be verbally informed of the possibility of confi -
dentiality being broken in certain circumstances, prior 
to consent being sought. With participants’ consent, 
we will digitally record some of intervention session 
randomly to improve quality in clinical supervision. 
Recordings will be made on an encrypted digital voice 
recorder and uploaded to a password protected com -
puter as soon as possible after completion. Recordings 
will be deleted from the recorder after uploading and 
destroyed in the presence of two researchers, after com -
pletion of analysis.
Plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage

in this trial/future use
Not applicable.
Data analysis
Statistical analysis
The study data will be analysed using SPSS (Version-22). 
Analysis of data will take place after full recruitment and 
data collection. Descriptive data analysis will be per -
formed to summarise demographic data and feasibility 
outcomes. Baseline and outcome assessment data will be 
summarised using the appropriate descriptive statistics 
and graphical summaries. As this is a feasibility study, 
the analysis of the data will be largely descriptive and will 
focus on confidence intervals for the difference amongst 
groups for each outcome measure. Possible between-
group differences will be assessed using analysis of vari -
ance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests. The results of the 
trial will follow the standard CONSORT recommenda -
tions. A complete statistical analysis plan will be written 
prior to database lock and subsequently will be discussed 
and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). 
There is no interim analysis planned.Process evaluation
One to one semi-structured interviews will be conducted 
with randomly selected participants from each interven -
tion group to explore the engagement with intervention, 
acceptability of the sessions, perceived benefits and barri -
ers. We are anticipating 10–12 interviews from each inter -
vention group to reach category saturation. We will also 
interview up to 2 therapists of each intervention group to 
explore their experiences of delivering the study interven -
tions including the factors that can impact intervention 
such as any environmental or cultural factors. The inter -
view will be conducted either face-to-face or through tele -
phone. Interviews will last between 50 and 60 min and will 
be digitally audio recorded on an encrypted voice record -
ing device. For analysis of interviews, thematic analysis 
[30] with constant comparison approach of qualitative 
evaluation will be used and major subthemes emerging 
from data will be presented. All interviews will be tran -
scribed and paraphrased in Urdu language to capture the 
qualitative richness of the participants understanding. To 
maintain the credibility and trustworthiness of the data 
and subsequent findings, the researchers will be super -
vised by senior and experienced qualitative researchers. 
Engagement in discussion and regular reviews by senior 
researcher will ensure fit of the data to the final analysis, 
and helped to minimise bias [49]. Analysis and writing 
will be guided by a quality checklist [50].
Health economics
A preliminary assessment of the costs to implement study 
interventions (MICBT, MBRP and CAMIAB) will be con -
ducted. A change in scores of EQ-5D from baseline to 24th 
weeks will also be conducted to determine feasibility of an 
economic evaluation for a future definitive trial.
Statistical methods to handle missing data
The groups will be analysed on an intention to treat 
basis. The analysis will determine effect sizes to con -
duct power calculations for a larger trial. In accord -
ance with the intention to treat principles, our aim is 
to follow-up all participants regardless of whether they 
have been lost during the intervention. Any missing 
follow-up data will be modelled on the assumption that 
it is missing at random. Logistic regression will be used 
to test this assumption, and to calculate probability of 
providing complete outcome data with baseline vari -
ables as predictors. These analyses will be used to cre -
ate inverse probability sampling weights for subsequent 
analyses on outcome.
Ethical considerations
Ethical approval for the study has been obtained from 
National Bioethics Committee (NBC) of Pakistan (Ref: 
Page 9 of 11
 Asif et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:67 
 
No. 4–87/NBC-467/20/47-Amend/21/1240). RAs will 
ask eligible participants to provide written informed 
consent for participation. Those participants who are 
not able to read and write will be provided with verbal 
information (in local language) that will encompass all 
the points mentioned in the written informed consent 
in presence of an independent trusted member who 
can read and write chosen by the participant. The con -
sent form will then be thumb printed by the participants 
along with signatures of the legal representative chosen.
Protocol amendments
Any amendments to the protocol will be communicated 
to NBC and other relevant authorities. The trial registra -
tion will be updated accordingly and revised protocol will 
be shared with research team and study investigators.
Oversight and data monitoring
The research team will meet every month to monitor pro -
gress and decide on operative issues related to the project. 
The trial manager will be responsible to oversee co-ordina -
tion between study centres. An independently chaired TSC 
and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will 
oversee the trial throughout its various stages. This will be 
independent of the trial management team. TSC will meet 
every 6  months or with advice from the chair as needed 
between meetings. The DMEC will monitor the data and 
ethical aspects throughout the trial and advise the TSC on 
changes to the conduct of the study and whether there are 
any ethical or safety reasons why the trial should not con -
tinue. DMEC will consists of three independent members 
that collectively have expertise on mental health, statistics 
and health services research.
Risk management: adverse event reporting and harms
Where a Serious Adverse Events (SAE), or Adverse 
Events (AE) occur for a particular participant, the 
research team will halt the study for that individual 
and review: (a) whether to withdraw the participant 
from the study, and (b) whether to halt the entire pro -
ject. AEs will be recorded throughout the trial and any 
AE occurred will be immediately reported to PI within 
24 h. This decision will be based on a consideration of 
the likelihood that the study itself (including the ther -
apy and assessment procedures) contributed to the 
SAE (thus making it an Adverse Reaction; AR). Infor -
mation will be gathered including the participant’s and 
researcher or therapist’s perspective, and the timing 
of the AE or SAE (e.g. did it occur immediately after a 
intervention session?) to help inform this review. Where 
an AR is identified, it will be considered whether this 
could apply to other participants and therefore if the study as a whole should be halted. This review process 
will be documented. Adverse Events (AE) are defined 
here as any untoward, time-limited, worsening in par -
ticipants’ mental state or leading to a persistent increase 
in disability or incapacity. The occurrence of AEs will be 
monitored by the DMEC.
Dissemination plans
Study findings will be published as widely as possible in 
peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed journals and will be 
presented at local participatory centres, and national and 
international conferences. Workshop and seminars will be 
organised in collaboration with established partnerships to 
disseminate research findings and also to increase aware -
ness and reduce stigma associated with SUD. The study 
findings will also be disseminated through the PILL news -
letter. We publish quarterly newsletters on various mental 
health problems which are circulated across Pakistan to 
primary care, secondary care, colleges, universities, com -
munity centres and to service users and families. Lay sum -
maries will be made available on the project website and 
shared via social media sites, i.e. Facebook page, Instagram 
and twitter to make it available to the wider public. Press 
releases will be made relating to key project findings. Mem -
bers of the research team may give interviews relating to the 
study to the media outlets. Presentations about the research 
and key findings will also be undertaken with stakeholders 
linked to the project including clinical services, clinicians 
and local communities. Furthermore, the overall dissemi -
nation will take place after having an adequate dissemina -
tion plan which include journal publications.
Discussion
The protocol describes the process to assess the feasibility 
and acceptability of MICBT and MBRP (CAMIAB) inter -
vention for individuals with SUD. Although these are evi -
dence based interventions, research evidence on efficacy 
of these interventions for SUD in LMICs like Pakistan is 
limited. If proven effective, the trial will strengthen the 
evidence base for treatment of SUD. Based on the work 
during the trial period, we will establish a robust platform 
to conduct capacity building in order to facilitate oppor -
tunities for research knowledge deployment and knowl -
edge exchange. It will also help shape clinical practice, 
government policy and research in relation to supporting 
individuals with SUD.
Trial status
