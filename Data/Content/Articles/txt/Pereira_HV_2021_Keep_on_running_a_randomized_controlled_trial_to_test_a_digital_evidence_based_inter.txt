ABSTRACT
Background: This paper describes the rationale, intervention
development, study design and results from the pilot feasibility
study of the Keep On Running (KOR) trial. KOR aims to test a
web-based brief theory-based intervention, targetingmaintenance of recreational running behavior over time (i.e.
relapse preventing).
Methods: Intervention development was based both on Self-
Determination Theory and on Self-Regulation Theory. As part of
it, a pilot study was implemented ( n=18) to measure intervention
adherence and participant satisfaction in order to establish the
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention toolkit.
Furthermore, this pilot study was also used to test the feasibilityand acceptability of the questionnaires selected to be part of the
later RCT.
Results: Pilot intervention acceptability was good, but overall
adherence was low. Features such as feedback and social sharing
should be added to the toolkit. The main trial should lessenquestionnaire length and include data from usual monitoring
gadgets and apps (APIs). The protocol of the RCT was adjusted to
test the e ﬃcacy of the re ﬁnedﬁnal version of the intervention,
and the RCT that will test it, contributing to the understanding of
recreational running sustainability, allowing the optimization offuture interventions aimed at physical activity promotion.ARTICLE HISTORY

Background
While bene ﬁts of regular physical activity (PA) and exercise are well established (Kraus
et al., 2019 ; Oja et al., 2015 ), insu ﬃcient PA and the prevalence of sedentary behavior
remain as challenges in health promotion (Ding et al., 2016 ; Guthold, Stevens, Riley,
& Bull, 2018 ). Although research suggests that behavior change interventions can
increase PA over the course of an intervention, these e ﬀects are generally not persistent
after the intervention ends (McEwan, Rhodes, & Beauchamp, 2020 ).
Along with initial involvement, sustained adherence is a well-known challenge in
exercise contexts, as many people struggle to keep up their behavior for longer than 6
months (Kahlert, 2015 ; Marcus et al., 2000 ). Research on the characterization of
people who are physically active (Cortis et al., 2017 ; Sawyer, Ucci, Jones, Smith, &
Fisher, 2017 ) and manage to sustain their PA behavior (Amireault, Godinb, & Vézina-
Imb, 2013 ) is extensive. While most of the research about behavior sustainability
report how many discontinue practice, only few studies addressed the psychological
mechanisms of behavior maintenance (Kwasnicka, Dombrowski, White, & Sniehotta,2016 ), such as the quality of their motivation, the emotions and gains they experience
while exercising, or the regulatory resources they use to overcome exercise-related chal-
lenges and barriers.
Self-determination theory (SDT) (Deci & Ryan, 2000 ,2008 ) can provide a valid frame-
work to study PA maintenance. The underlying premise of SDT is that sustained motiv-
ation is elicited from within the person (not imposed by someone else) and thatsupporting clients ’basic needs for autonomy (need to feel a sense of choice, volition
and self-endorsement), competence (need to feel a sense of mastery and capacity to
accomplish the behavior), and relatedness (need to feel meaningfully connected toothers, valued and understood) will best promote the initiation and maintenance ofbehavior change, by fostering autonomous motivation and well-being. Conversely,
when these three needs are thwarted, people will tend to develop controlled motivations,
regulating their behavior based on external contingencies and internalized self-judg-ments (Vansteenkiste & Ryan, 2013 ).
In addition, not all types of goals have the same consequences (Ryan, Sheldon, Kasser,
& Deci, 1996 ). The outcomes that individuals are pursuing through the new behavior can
have intrinsic or extrinsic qualities, which can also in ﬂuence behavior maintenance. Rela-
tive to ‘extrinsic goals ’(e.g. wealth, social recognition, physical attractiveness), ‘intrinsic ’
goals (e.g. health, personal growth, social connectedness) tend to be regulated by moreself-determined forms of behavioral regulation and are thought to result in improvedself-regulation and longer-term outcomes (Ingledew & Markland, 2009 ).
In summary, SDT interventions have a signi ﬁcant e ﬀect on health behavior change
(Sheeran et al., 2020 ). Additionally, SDT-informed interventions positively a ﬀect
indices of health, partly due to increases in internalization, self-determined motivation
and support from social agents, and were stronger at the end of interventions than at
follow up (Ntoumanis et al., 2020 ). The e ﬀect sizes seen in PA interventions are mediated
by our current theories (Rhodes, Boudreau, Josefsson, & Ivarsson, 2020 ). Taken together,
recent evidence suggests that SDT (Deci & Ryan, 2000 ) can provide a valid framework to
study PA maintenance. Furthermore, aligning motivational and post-motivational (i.e.self-regulatory) features represents a promising avenue for lasting behavior change150 H. V. PEREIRA ET AL.
(Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2014 ). In this regard, self-regultory skills such as self-monitor-
ing, individualized goal setting or action planning, have been identi ﬁed as important
mediators of the e ﬀect of interventions on long-term physical activity and as potentially
core features of e ﬀective behavior change/maintenance interventions (Rhodes et al.,
2020 ).
Thousands of health-related applications (apps) are available world-wide for smart-
phones and represent a unique opportunity to reach a broad audience of users. Themost popular apps are for exercise, diet, and weight management, and 500 million
users use mobile health applications. Mobile health interventions have surged in popu-
larity but their implementation varies widely, and evidence of e ﬀectiveness is mixed
(Dugas, Gao, & Agarwal, 2020 ). When trying to understand design features through
the SDT lens, only one-fourth of the sample provided users support for the three basic
psychological needs of competence, autonomy and relatedness (Villalobos-Zúñiga,2020 ). It was found that prompts and cues, techniques of personalization, feedback
and monitoring, goal setting and action planning were most commonly used in
eﬀective mobile health interventions (Dugas et al., 2020 ).
The case for recreational running
Running is one of the most popular forms of leisure-time exercise (Andersen, 2020 ;
Running-USA, 2020 ; Teixeira, Marques, Lopes, Sardinha, & Mota, 2019 ) in part
because it is inexpensive and can be performed anywhere, almost at any time. In addition,it requires little technical skills, is relatively safe, and it is easy to learn. The health bene ﬁts
of running are vast, including prevention of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2
diabetes, osteoarthritis and hip replacement, benign prostatic hypertrophy, respiratorydisease, cancer, disability, reduction of cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality (Lavie
et al., 2015 ; Lee et al., 2014 ; Pedisic et al., 2019 ).
Running stimulates the interest of the research community, especially because of the
long hours of training throughout the year and the large number of events runners par-
ticipate in (Zach et al., 2017 ). This suggests that motivational aspects related with training
for and completing a race may be unique (Zach et al., 2017 ). With this in mind, running
clubs/groups may provide a novel testbed for understanding why people adopt rec-reational running and how motivational factors can support PA maintenance.
To better promote running sustainability and its long-term health bene ﬁts, it is crucial
to understand individuals ’running experiences and outcomes, as well as the factors that
predispose them to engage in this activity. Studying the antecedents and outcomes of
running motivation, as well as the e ﬃcacy of di ﬀerent types of interventions to
promote running behavior will enhance the understanding of the phenomenon, possiblycreating new insights into the e ﬀective promotion of PA maintenance.
To our knowledge, no previous study has been designed to test the e ﬃcacy of inter-
ventions to promote sustained running behavior and identify the mechanisms behindit. Future interventions will aim to test if motivation and self-regulation mediators can
be successfully modi ﬁed via a digital-based intervention. This will ultimately lead to sus-
tained adherence to an activity that participants have chosen and appear to enjoy, vialarge-reach interventions, capitalizing on the widespread availability of running clubs/events and increased reliance of exercisers on remote technologies.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 151
This paper describes the rationale, intervention development, study design, and pilot
study of the Keep On Running (KOR) trial. KOR aims to test a brief theory-based inter-
vention, delivered through digital technology (web app), targeting maintenance of rec-reational running behavior over time (i.e. relapse prevention) after being voluntarilyinitiated in the previous 3 months. The pilot study was focused on intervention adher-
ence and participant satisfaction in order to establish the feasibility and acceptability
of the intervention toolkit. Furthermore, it was also used to test the feasibility and accept-ability of the questionnaires selected to be part of the later RCT.
Study objectives and hypotheses
The study ’s objective is to develop and present a new digital toolkit aiming at mainten-
ance of recreational running behavior over time (i.e. relapse preventing), and evaluatewhether it can be delivered and accepted by participants. We hypothesize that the
built intervention can be delivered and will be accepted by the participants, and tested
by the RCT.
Methods
Study design
KOR is a Randomized controlled trial (RCT). It was developed based on a logic model
(Figure 1 ), adapting the motivational and self-regulation arm of the NoHoW study
(Marques et al., 2020 ; Scott et al., 2019 ). The trial involved combinations of two con-
ditions: (a) organized (i.e. Programa Nacional de Marcha e Corrida –PNMC) vs. free
recreational runners (FRR), and (b) self-regulation and motivation (SRM) intervention
vs. no intervention.
As a result, it comprises four di ﬀerent groups ( Figure 2 ): (i) a group of runners
enrolled in the running program and additionally receiving the theory-based
Figure 1. KoR ’s Logic Model.152 H. V. PEREIRA ET AL.
intervention (PNMC + SRM); (ii) a group of runners merely participating in the orga-
nized running program (PNMC); (iii) a group of FRR receiving the theory-based inter-
vention (FRR + SRM); and lastly, (iv) a group of FRR receiving only general informationon running (i.e. control group).
This approach was taken because (a) comparing runners belonging to PNMC with
FRR (i.e. control group) allows examining the e ﬀect of the PNMC on behavior mainten-
ance; (b) comparing FRR enrolled in the SRM intervention with FRR allows testing theeﬀectiveness of a light-touch intervention on motivational and other psychological vari-
ables, and on behavior maintenance; and (c) comparing runners belonging to PNMC and
receiving the SRM intervention with FRR receiving the SRM intervention will allowsexamining whether the SRM intervention has an additional e ﬀect on the study outcomes.
Trial duration is one year with assessments at 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months postbaseline
(Figure 3 ).
Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria : age between 18 and 65 years; running for no longer than 3 months; per-
forming a minimum of 60 min of vigorous physical activity per week; being free from
major orthopedic limitations (de ﬁned as those which would limit moderate to vigorous
physical activity (MVPA)); and from clinical diagnosis with any condition that may
interfere with performing MVPA; being free from untreated or major psychological

disorders (e.g. psychosis, clinical depression); and possessing or willing to acquire a
smartphone or computer with internet access.
Exclusion criteria : inability to provide written informed consent; inability to follow
written material or telephone conversations in Portuguese that would preclude com-pletion of study questionnaires and use of the digital intervention (i.e. KOR toolkit,
see below); intention of pregnancy in the next 12 months; planning to travel for more
than 2 weeks in the next 12 months or to emigrate; su ﬀering any injury in the course
of the study.
Motivation and self-regulation intervention
We developed a web-based intervention adapted from the motivational and self-regu-
lation arm of the NoHoW tria (Marques et al., 2020 ; Scott et al., 2019 ). It consists of
11 short sessions divided in 8 modules with motivational and self-regulation based exer-cises, quizzes, videos and animations aimed to elicit re ﬂection about motives, goals, bar-
riers and strategies to foster running behavior sustainability. Beyond the long-term
promotion of running behavior, by implementing theory-based and evidence-basedbehavior change techniques, this brief intervention aims at promoting participants ’
intrinsic and well-internalized motivations for running and the use of self-regulation
skills (e.g. goal setting) that facilitate behavior maintenance.
The intervention includes:
i Access to a web-based intervention comprising 11 distinct sessions of 5 –10 min each
and 8 educational modules concerning motivation and self-regulation constructs,
delivered through several technological implementations, including videos, anima-
tions, quizzes and exercises, as well as images, text and audio ( Figure 4 ). Several mul-
timedia tools, including a web-based HTML5 interactive map as a navigation tool forthe SRM sessions ( http://lea ﬂetjs.com/ ), the questionnaires platform to design
Figure 4. Screenshots of the intervention toolkit.154 H. V. PEREIRA ET AL.
interactive features, and whiteboard drawings to convey some of the more theoreti-
cal constructs of the intervention ( http://www.videoscribe.co/ ), were used to develop
these implementations, supported by the team ’s previous experience in similar
interventions.
ii Bi-weekly text messages (see Table 1 for an overview of weekly text messages to par-
ticipants) are sent to prompt participants toward the sessions and each week speci ﬁc
contents. Yet, participants are able to move faster or slower through the program toﬁt their needs and availability.
The SRM intervention includes both motivation and self-regulation components. The
intervention ’s theoretical logic model is adapted from the NoHoW project (Marques
et al., 2020 ; Scott et al., 2019 ) and presented in Figure 1 . The self-regulation skills com-
ponent will seek to empower users to identify goals and make action plans for when,where, and how the goals will be implemented, allowing them to formulate explicit
implementation intentions. Coping plans for relapses will also be supported. The moti-
vational component is therefore based on SDT and con ﬁgured to optimally support par-
ticipants ’psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, via speci ﬁc
technological implementations (e.g. self-awareness exercises, videos and practice
modules), and as a result improve autonomous regulation of physical activity behaviors.Participants will explore personal motives to run, skills, life goals, social connections, and
other motivational elements. Messages, videos, animations, self-awareness question-
naires, among other tools, will stimulate users ’sense of volition and ownership (vs. exter-
nal pressure), con ﬁdence and competence (vs. unpreparedness and sense of failure), and
positive social support (vs. isolation). It is anticipated that the use of these implemen-
tations will increase autonomous self-regulation and intrinsic motivation, which areassociated with longer-term behavior change, and positive health outcomes.
The SRM web-based toolkit will be accessible only to the groups receiving the SRM
intervention. In addition, all the study participants will receive weekly email messages

with general technical information about running. An individual telephone session will
introduce runners to speci ﬁc elements of their unique intervention and how it will
unfold.
Recruitment and randomization
Part of the runners will be recruited from the PNMC program, which consists in 2 –3
supervised running group-sessions of 10 –20 runners per week, lasting 90 min each.
Certiﬁed trainers lead these sessions, apply speci ﬁc methodologies for running and for
walking sessions. Prior to their enrollment, trainers must complete a training course.
The other set of runners (which run freely, on their own) will be recruited from the com-
munity (recreational runners). To recruit this sample, we will use online advertisementand running events list servers, reach out for running clubs, and partnerships with bothstate and private organizations.
We will use a rolling recruitment strategy: participants will join the study as soon as
they are considered eligible to facilitate management of available human resources. Eachset of runners will be randomly assigned to the KoR intervention group or the control
group general information group in a 1:1 ratio, strati ﬁed by group (PNMC and FRR).
The method of randomized permuted blocks will be used, with random block lengths(4 or 6) (Broglio, 2018 ). Because participants will know which arm of the study they
are in, blinding is not possible.
Assessments
Data on demographics (age, gender, date of birth, education, income, employment,
marital status, weight, height, physical activity history, and personal characteristics)
and potential psychological moderators (i.e. index of autonomous functioning) will be
collected only at baseline.
The primary outcome of this study is running behavior, which will be measured at
baseline, intervention ’s end and 6-month follow-up by self-report (frequency and
minutes of running per week). At 12 months, participants will be asked by telephonewhether they keep running (at least) at their initial level, or not.
Secondary outcomes will include putative mediators and outcomes. Basic psychologic
need satisfaction will be assessed via the Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise Scale
(Wilson, Rogers, Rodgers, & Wild, 2006 ); Basic psychological need frustration will be
assessed trough the Basic Psychological Need Frustration in Exercise Scale (Chen
et al., 2015 ); Motives and gains via Exercise Motives and Gains Inventory (Ingledew,
Markland, & Strömmer, 2014 ); Behavioral regulations will be assessed via the Behavioral
Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire –3 (Cid et al., 2018 ); Self-determination trait will
be assessed via the Index of Autonomy Functioning (Weinstein, Przybylski, & Ryan,
2012 ); Self-regulation skills will be measured trough the Action planning, Coping plan-
ning, and Action control scales (Sniehotta, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2005a ; Sniehotta,
Schwarzer, Scholz, & Schuz, 2005b ); Self-e ﬃcacy will be assessed via the Modi ﬁed Ban-
dura ’s Exercise Self-E ﬃcacy Scale (Bandura, 1997 ); Automaticity will be measured
trough the Self-Report Behavioural Automaticity Index (Gardner & Tang, 2014 ;
Gardner, Abraham, Lally, & de Bruijn, 2012 ); and exercise identity via the Exercise156 H. V. PEREIRA ET AL.
Identity Scale (Anderson & Cychosz, 1994 ). Regarding psychological outcomes, ﬂow will
be measured through the Dispositional Flow Scale –2 in Exercise (Jackson & Eklund,
2002 ); Vitality will be assessed through the Subjective Vitality Scale (Ryan & Frederick,
1997 ); and passion through the Passion Scale (Cid et al., 2019 ).
Data collection
Participants will go through four assessment periods at baseline, 6 weeks (post-
program), 6 months, and 12 months follow-up. The training and clari ﬁcation
session will be completed by telephone to ensure participants are equipped with the
skills to access the intervention contents. Before the ﬁrst, third and fourth assessment
periods, eligibility will be checked against inclusion and exclusion criteria through atelephone screening/re-screening call, 1 week prior to each visit. Participant ’s timeline
is shown in Figure 3 .
Assessment 1 (baseline): Clari ﬁcation session about the study. If participants are
still interested in enrolling in the study, eligibility will be checked, and they will beasked to ﬁll out an informed consent form. Randomization and allocation to one
of the four arms of the trial will be performed. Data on demographics and potential
psychological moderators will be collected. A battery of psychological and behavioralquestionnaires will be completed online using google forms (in one-week time) –
running behavior (i.e. frequency and minutes per week), motivations, basic psycho-
logical needs, motives and gains, self-regulation skills, passion, ﬂow, and vitality.
This task is estimated to take approximately 1 h, but participants will be able todo breaks and return later to complete the psychometric evaluation during that
week. Debrief on how to use the KOR web-based intervention content –the
toolkit (approximately 1 h).
Assessment s 2 and 3 (intervention ’s end and 6-month follow-up). Email reminder
prior to this evaluation period will be sent. The same battery of psychological and behav-
ioral questionnaires will be completed online using google forms (in one-week time) –
running behavior (i.e. frequency and minutes per week), motivations, basic psychological
needs, motives and gains, self-regulation skills, passion, ﬂow, and vitality –, and will take
approximately 1 h.
Assessment 4 (12-month follow-up). Running behavior maintenance will be assessed
through a telephone call, asking participants whether they keep running at their initial
level or higher, or not.
Analytical strategy
Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS Statistics version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., an IBM
Company, Chicago IL, USA). Descriptive statistics will be calculated (mean, standard
deviation and range). Repeated measures with Bonferroni corrections for adjusted com-parisons will be used to examine di ﬀerences between each intervention group(PNMC or
SRM) and controls (i.e. free recreational runners), at all assessment points, in the primary
and secondary outcomes measured. Statistical signi ﬁcance will be set at p< 0.05.
Mediation analysis, will test the psychological mechanisms underlying changes in
running behavior from baseline to post program, 6 and 12 months. Multilevel modelingHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 157
will be used to determine the SRM intervention e ﬀect on these motivational variables,
with intervention group (SRM vs. Control group) as the between-subject factor and
change in self-regulation and competence for running at baseline, 6 –8 weeks, 6months
and 12 months, serving as dependent variables. If necessary, multiple imputationmethods will be implemented to provide robust results for primary and main secondary
outcomes.
Power calculations and sample size estimation
Two types of sample size calculations were made: (a) using the primary outcome –
running minutes and (b) using secondary outcomes, in particular, changes on key psy-chosocial variables. Regarding our primary outcome, we have used vigorous physical
activity for our calculations. A small e ﬀect size (Cohen ’sd= 0.23) is expected, a value pre-
viously registered in studies with intrinsic motivation interventions (Ntoumanis et al.,2020 ; Sheeran et al., 2020 ). Considering a power of 0.8 with two-tailed analysis, we esti-
mated that each intervention group should have 37 ( p= 0.05) or 55 participants ( p=
0.01). Concerning our secondary outcomes, we are expecting e ﬀects sizes ranging
from 0.23 to 0.73, based on previous reports (Ntoumanis et al., 2020 ; Sheeran et al.,
2020 ). Thus, assuming an e ﬀect size of 0.50, 18 subjects/group will be required to
detect signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences at p= 0.05 and 28 for p= 0.01. Given that the primary
outcome is expected to have a smaller e ﬀect size, and expecting a dropout rate of 15%
at follow-up, we estimate that approximately 55 subjects/group are needed at baseline
(for p= 0.05). Thus, recruiting 220 participants will ensure high statistical power for
our primary analyses, extending its power to the secondary analyses.
Trial results will be published in peer-reviewed scienti ﬁc journals and in several inter-
national and national scienti ﬁc conferences. The website will be our central media to
promote the dissemination of the results to the general public. Other media will bereached through university partners and website.
Pilot feasibility study
This pilot study is focused on intervention adherence and participant satisfaction, in
order to establish the feasibility and acceptability of the web-based intervention toolkit
and questionnaires. Besides eligibility, baseline and post-program questionnaires, partici-
pants were interviewed about their overall experience with questionnaire ﬁlling and
toolkit (Smailes et al., 2016 ). Additionally, toolkit usage analytics were obtained. The
pilot feasibility study was conducted in order to better inform the ﬁnal program and pro-
cedures. This study, as well as implications for ﬁnal protocol are brie ﬂy described here.
Pilot study participants
Pilot participants were recruited among the running community through online adver-
tisement. Study procedures were equivalent to those de ﬁned for the RCT, except that par-
ticipants were not randomized, following the path of the study as if they were included inthe intervention group. Participants were informed about the results of this pilot by indi-vidual reports.158 H. V. PEREIRA ET AL.
The pilot feasibility study was a 6-week non-controlled trial without the follow-up.
Considering an expected e ﬀect size of 0.23, 55 subjects per arm should be required in
the main trial to detect signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences at p= 0.05 (see sample size calculations
for the main trial). Bearing in mind the rule of thumb for pilot sample size (Bell, White-head, & Julious, 2018 ), for an 80% powered main trial, with an expected medium e ﬀect
size, the pilot should have between 10 and 15 subjects per arm.
Results of the pilot feasibility study
Due to recruitment problems, the eligibility criteria for participants with more than threemonths of running experience were more ﬂexible. All other recruitment procedures were
equivalent to the RCT.
Pilot participant characteristics
The CONSORT diagram for the pilot is shown in Figure 5 . In total, 18 participants were
enrolled and completed the baseline assessment. Of those, 3 dropped out during the
intervention, allegedly due to time constraints and injuries; 15 participants ﬁnished
the 6 week-intervention, 7 the post-program questionnaire, and 14 the overall study sat-isfaction questionnaire.
Participants ( N= 18, 33% female), between 25 and 54 years-old (average 42.1 yrs.),
were generally self-perceived as healthy (94%), highly educated (78%), and livedmostly in the Lisbon area (83%). Participants reported to run an average of 27 km and
4.4 h per week. Running experience ranged from 1 month to 30 years (average 6.3
yrs.). Most participants (88.9%) wore a running monitoring device to keep track oftheir running, social sharing and coaching, and 94.4% included other types of exercisein their training regime, such as warm-up and stretching, weight training or calisthenics,
exercise classes or biking. A total of 61.1% used social media for motivation, education,
interaction and coaching purposes.
Pilot adherence and program usage
From the 18 participants allocated to the intervention, 17 (94.4%) logged at least once,
50% logged once, and 22.2% twice. Only 6 (33.3%) completed the ﬁrst session. Partici-
pants ’session completion decreased at sessions two ( N= 5; 27.8%), ﬁve (N= 4; 22.2%),
and only three participants (16.7%) completed sessions from eight to eleven. During
the course of the program 12 participants (66.7%) logged at least one race (1 –15 races,
average 5.2), and the average run lengthened 9.4 Km (4 –14 Km).
Pilot program evaluation: participant satisfaction
Overall, participants understood the purpose of the study, the concepts underlying the
questionnaires and the toolkit, and felt supported by the research team. Most participants
(83.3%) found the questionnaire too long. Participants generally found the toolkitwebsite to be attractive and user friendly, classifying their overall experience with the
study as positive. Most of the interviewed participants already used a running monitoring
app, so they found the program to be less intuitive, repetitive in some questions andmissing out important aspects such as ‘time of day, speed/ pace, and altimetry ’. Addition-
ally, participants reported problems with platform adjustment that led to ‘informationHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 159
overlap when used on cellphone ’, the fact that ‘it didn ’t keep data inserted in previous
sessions ’and ‘errors in google docs that forced them to restart the questionnaire ’.
Three participants su ﬀered injuries during the intervention period (25%). Two had
muscular running-related injuries in the lower limbs and one had a foot trauma injury
while playing football.
This pilot study had limitations that need to be considered, Due to recruitment con-
straints, the ﬁnal sample included long time runners, which may di ﬀer from beginners,
targeted by the RCT protocol. The low sample size and the absence of follow-up hindered
further interpretation about the e ﬃcacy of the toolkit as it is.
Ethics and dissemination
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Human Kin-
etics, University of Lisbon (CEFMH 3/2018) and will be conducted in accordance with
the declaration of Helsinki for human studies (World Medical Association, 2013 ). All
participants will be informed about the possible risks of the investigation before givingtheir written informed consent to participate. Data from google forms (questionnaires),the intervention quizzes and toolkit analytics will be handled and stored in excel and

SPSSﬁles in a secure faculty server for ten years. Data will then be destroyed. All personal
data will be anonymised at source. There will be no names or other identi ﬁers in the
manuscripts and qualitative descriptions whatsoever. Data will only be linked back tothe individual via a separately stored coding system. Interventions will be discontinuedif they are reported detrimental. Protocol deviations, violations and serious adverse
events will be recorded by trial sta ﬀand monitored by the principal investigator (PJT)
(MRC, 2017 ).
Discussion
This paper presents the rationale, development, study design, methods and pilot appli-
cation of the KOR trial, aimed at testing the e ﬀect of the intervention on the maintenance
of recreational running behavior over time, after being voluntarily initiated by commu-nity-dwelling adults in the previous 3 months. This ‘light-touch ’intervention is unique in
that it approaches running behavior and its sustainability, delivered in a digital format,
and based on strong theoretical foundations.
We hypothesize that the sustainability o f running behaviors will be higher in the
SRM groups compared to the control group . Change in running behavior (e.g. fre-
quency and minutes of running per week) and secondary outcomes related to thequality of the running experience (e.g. passion, ﬂow, vitality) will be used as the depen-
dent variables.
Additionally, the results of the pilot feasi bility study, intended at testing interven-
tion adherence, participant satisfaction, and questionnaire acceptance, were also pre-
s e n t e d .O v e r a l l ,t h ep i l o ts t u d yi n d i c a t e dt hat the intervention has good acceptability,
feedback was very positive, but toolkit interaction decreased after the ﬁrst weeks,
which is common in web-based interventions (Baumel & Yom-Tov, 2018 ). Moreover,
the generalized use of other running-related devices, applications and communities
may have overlapped with the anticipated cont ent of the toolkit, challenging partici-
pants ’interaction. The completion ratio of th e post-program questionnaire was low,
maybe due to its extension and burden, but also because its timeline ended near the
summer break.
The main trial should reduce questionnaire length and burden, and include interface
with usual monitoring gadgets and apps (APIs), to increase data detail and prevent
‘unnecessary ’data insertion by the participants. Features such as feedback and social
sharing, added to the goal setting features already integrated in the toolkit, may alsoincrease attractiveness (Hosseinpour & Terlutter, 2019 ).
Conclusion
This paper describes the rationale, the process of developing, study design, methods, and
the pilot study of the KOR intervention. Valuable lessons are taken from the pilot feasi-bility study and adjustments will be made in the intervention and in its delivery, in order
to improve adherence and overall experience. Results from the RCT will test the e ﬃcacy
of this approach, contribute to the understanding of recreational running sustainability,and can be used in the development and optimization of future interventions aimed atphysical activity promotion.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 161
