A personhood and citizenship training 
workshop for care home staff to potentially 
increase wellbeing of residents with dementia: 
intervention development and feasibility testing 
of a cluster randomised controlled trial

Abstract 
Background In the UK, one third of people with dementia live in residential care homes, a sector where high staff 
turnover negatively affects continuity of care. To examine the effect of including personhood and citizenship princi-
ples in training, interventions need to be robustly tested, with outcomes relevant to residents with dementia.
Methods Phase one intervention development: The training intervention (PERSONABLE) comprised five reflective 
exercises facilitated by a mental health nurse/researcher. PERSONABLE was informed by four focus groups, and one 
field exercise, consisting of care home staff and family members. Phase two feasibility testing: Participants were (i) care 
home residents with dementia and (ii) care home staff working in any role. After baseline measurements, care homes 
were randomly allocated to (i) staff receiving PERSONABLE training or (ii) training as usual. Feasibility outcomes were 
the recruitment and attrition of care homes, residents and staff members (measured ten weeks between randomisa-
tion and follow-up), the acceptability of the training intervention PERSONABLE, and acceptability of outcome meas-
ures. The care home environment was evaluated, at baseline, using the Therapeutic Environment Screening Survey for 
Residential Care Homes. Measurements conducted at baseline and follow-up were resident wellbeing (Dementia Care 
Mapping™), staff knowledge of and confidence with personhood and citizenship (Personhood in Dementia Question-
naire and a perceived ability to care visual analogue scale). Inter-rater agreement for Dementia Care Mapping™ was 
undertaken at follow-up in one intervention and one training as a usual care home.
Results Phase one: The developed reflective approach to the PERSONABLE exercises appeared to give staff a holistic 
understanding of residents living with dementia, seeing them as autonomous people rather than reductively as per -
sons with a condition. Phase two: Six care homes, 40 residents and 118 staff were recruited. Four residents were lost to 
follow-up. Twenty-nine staff in the PERSONABLE arm of the study received the training intervention. In the PERSON-
ABLE arm, 26 staff completed both baseline and follow-up measurements compared to 21 in the training as the usual 
arm. The most common reason for the loss to follow-up of staff was leaving employment. For the outcome measure 
Dementia Care Mapping™, the proportion of overall agreement between the two observers was 18.6%. High attrition 
of staff occurred in those homes undergoing leadership changes.

Conclusion With the right approach, it is possible to achieve good engagement during trial recruitment and inter -
vention delivery of care home managers, staff and residents. Organisational changes are a less controllable aspect of 
trials but having a visible researcher presence during data collection helps to capitalise the engagement of those staff 
remaining in employment. Tailored, brief and flexible training interventions encourage staff participation. Simplifica-
tion of study methods helps promote and retain sufficient staff in a definitive randomised controlled trial. This study 
found that some components of Dementia Care Mapping™ work effectively as an outcome measure. However, inter-
rater reliability was poor, and the practical implementation of the measurement would need a great deal of further 
refinement to accurately capture the effect of a training intervention if delivered across a large number of clusters. 
The Dementia Care Mapping™ measurement fidelity issue would be further complicated if using multiple different 
unacquainted observers.

Background
“I am a human being. I still exist … what I ask for is that 
what is left of my life shall have some meaning. Give me 
something to die for!”
George Thomas (a person with dementia), in ([9 ], 
page 31).
George is one of an estimated 815,827 people with 
dementia living in the UK [34]. Around 291,000 peo -
ple in England and Wales live in care homes, a diverse 
group needing individualised care (Office for National 
Statistics, [24, 34]). The identity and sense of purpose 
of this group of people can be compromised by limited 
access to the diverse community beyond the care home 
walls [23].
Care staff turnover is around a third in the first year 
of employment [10] inevitably affecting the continuity 
of care [21]. Increasing the provision of training has the 
potential to improve staff wellbeing and turnover [14, 
25]. The Care Certificate, developed in response to The 
Cavendish Report [12], is usually delivered via eLearning, 
mostly covering basic practical skills needed for care, but 
does little to enhance staff understanding of person-cen -
tred care [15].
Conducting trials in care homes has presented many 
challenges [29], and in the EPIC trial, the ability to obtain 
sufficient data was reportedly  limited by the demands 
of busy care environments and high staff turnover. One 
approach that indicates better success with interven -
tion engagement is when a study takes a more bespoke 
approach such as in the WHELD study [2] [13]. This 
study  reiterating the recommendations that research 
conducted in care homes be adapted to the practi -
cal demands of these busy work environments. Other 
authors [18] have highlighted the role that care home 
managers can play in the initial stages of a trial, when good engagement can positively affect trial recruitment 
of care homes.
Many researchers who have designed dementia training 
for interventions include a component of personhood but 
to a lesser extent citizenship principles [22]. Personhood 
is often used as a universal term, encompassing aspects 
of the community ‘lens’ of citizenship [4]). Attempts have 
been made to [33] differentiate the two theories as ‘see -
ing the person’ (personhood) and ‘seeing the person as an 
active social agent’ (citizenship). Despite the similarities 
between personhood and citizenship the two theories 
have a distinct utility when applied to residential care 
home settings. For the purposes of this intervention, the 
two concepts were specifically defined (Table 1).
Study objectives
This feasibility study aimed to assess the acceptability and 
feasibility of conducting PERSONABLE, a short reflec -
tive personhood and citizenship workshop intervention, 
in residential care homes and piloting the intervention 
within a cluster randomised trial. Specific study objec -
tives were as follows:
1) Intervention development and acceptability: to 
develop personhood and citizenship training among

care home staff and evaluate the acceptability of the 
finalised PERSONABLE intervention.
2) Participant recruitment and retention: to estimate 
the flow of residents, staff, and care homes in a future 
definitive randomised controlled trial.
3) Outcome measurement suitability: assess the accept -
ability to residents and staff of outcome measures 
and their potential for detecting any possible effect of 
the PERSONABLE intervention.
Methods
Design
The study was delivered in two phases. Phase one: inter -
vention development using focus groups. Phase two: 
testing the feasibility of an intervention within a cluster 
RCT methodology.
Phase one: intervention development methods
To build on the original idea for the personhood and 
citizenship training intervention, a series of four 
focus groups were conducted in three residential care 
homes. Topic guides were adapted to reflect the poten -
tial diversity of participants while retaining the focus 
on intervention development. Sequentially gathering 
focus group data and then revising the PERSONABLE 
exercises iteratively informed intervention adaptations. 
Focus group dynamics and discourse were observed by 
a nurse, independent to the PERSONABLE study team 
and experienced in the needs of residential care homes. 
Focus group data were analysed using framework anal -
ysis (Smith and Firth, [28]). Mapping data by job role 
informed changes to PERSONABLE tailored to poten -
tially diverse staff experiences and work practices. To 
highlight practical areas in need of consideration, the 
core issues arising from the framework analysis were 
separated into those which enhanced or detracted from 
a personhood or citizenship approach to care, or fac -
tors which might affect the effective delivery of a train -
ing intervention. The framework was then mapped 
against the topic guide themes of (1) staff characteris -
tics, (2) current training, (3) personhood and citizen -
ship, and (4) PERSONABLE feedback. Subsequent 
changes to the PERSONABLE exercises were made 
in conjunction with a working group of professionals 
familiar with dementia care and adaptations were car -
ried into subsequent focus groups.
Once adaptations informed by focus group data were 
complete the PERSONABLE intervention was delivered to a group of care staff and subsequently further refine -
ments were made. This fieldwork exercise was observed 
by AA, a nurse experienced in the care of people with 
dementia.
Phase one: results
The four focus groups comprised a total of 12 care home 
staff, working in a variety of roles, and three family car -
ers. The fieldwork, which followed the focus groups, 
had five care worker participants and occurred in a care 
home independent of the focus group sites. Following 
the focus groups and fieldwork, the exact design and 
delivery of PERSONABLE was finalised. Changes made 
during this process related to participant comments on 
(i) the practical delivery of an intervention, which con -
sidered length, time and days of the week, universally the 
staff groups asserted delivery of an intervention should 
be brief in the quiet afternoon period of the day; (ii) 
the mode of delivery, whether a taught or more reflec -
tive and applied approach should be undertaken, with 
all staff groups reporting a preference for more reflective 
approaches to their learning; and (iii) the content of the 
intervention, type of information and the level at which 
content should be pitched, interestingly in this domain 
there was no significant variation in the knowledge 
and understanding demonstrated by care worker staff, 
or those with less ‘care’related patient contact such as 
cleaning staff, each staff group having their own vocation 
related observations on resident experiences.
The final version of PERSONABLE consisted of five con -
secutive elements: (1) Exercise one ‘from waking to work’: 
resident choice and autonomy; (2) Exercise two ‘reflections 
on personhood’: reflecting on staff personhood; (3) Exer -
cise three ‘reflections on personhood’: reflecting on resi -
dent personhood; (4) Exercise four ‘from outside to inside’: 
replicating community diversity; and (5) Exercise five ‘the 
pledge’: turning reflection into action. The choices made 
when adapting the original idea for the workshop into this 
finalised version are summarised in Table 2 .
The PERSONABLE exercises aimed to give staff a 
holistic understanding of residents living with dementia 
and seeing them as autonomous people (exercise one) 
rather than reductively as persons with a condition. The 
staff considered their own personhood (exercise two) 
and were then asked to compare this personal appraisal 
with an appraisal of the personhood of a resident with 
dementia (exercise three). PERSONABLE was designed 
to help participants consider how they might promote 
a sense of community and purpose (exercise four) and 
encourage these care practices within the residential 
care environment (exercise five).

Phase two: methods
Setting
The study took place in care homes in the East of Eng -
land. A mixture of small and larger care homes located 
in urban and rural locations was approached.
Participants
Care home Residential care homes in the East of Eng -
land were eligible if they provided care for people with 
dementia. Resident: Residents were eligible if they had a 
diagnosis of dementia with either capacity to consent to 
participation in the study or who had a consultee as out -
lined within the terms of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 
(Department of Health, [11]). Residents were excluded 
if they were receiving palliative care or had an acute ill -
ness. Staff: Staff was eligible if they were employed on 
a full or part-time basis, working in any role such as 
care worker, ancillary, maintenance or administrative 
positions. Senior management was excluded because 
of their potential involvement in resident participant 
selection.Baseline measurements
All baseline measurements were collected by JC prior to 
randomisation in all six sites. Descriptive information 
about each care home was obtained from the care home 
manager, including care home ownership, number of res -
ident bedrooms and number of staff.
Residential care home The quality of the usual care 
environment was measured using the Therapeutic Envi -
ronment Screening Survey for Residential Care (TESS-
RC) [ 27], which consists of 31 items. In response to com -
ments from the ethics committee granting permission to 
conduct this research, only the 23 items relating to public 
areas of the care home were used.
Dementia Care Mapping™ Dementia Care Mapping™ 
(DCM™) was originally developed [19, 20] as a practice 
development tool. Version 8 of the DCM™ observa -
tional measure was used for this study, and the measure 
has been reported as valid and reliable [6]. In DCM™, an 
observer attempts to interpret the experience of those 
who have dementia and then reflectively discuss the 
observation data with staff [7, 17, 31, 32]. Because of the Table 2 Adaptations to PERSONABLE after analysing focus group data
Waking to work exercise - Refining the key purpose to exploring the utility of resident ‘choice’ .
Initially designed to address resident choice and community diversity. All groups commented that the exercise did not make them think about com-
munity diversity ‘it highlighted more about choice but not what you said about the community’ and ‘it’s more about choice than (the community)’ . 
Staff readily understood the need for resident choice ‘loads of choices that we can make every day and take for granted’ , but not necessarily as a 
platform for considering the underlying citizenship of being assisted to make autonomous decisions; therefore, this was added as a teaching point to 
the final version of PERSONABLE.
Exercises two and three: Personhood - Following focus group feedback, the personhood domain relating to ‘neurological impairment’ changed to 
‘How I learn’ .
Consensus from all groups that ‘neurological impairment’ implies disablement. All groups felt any replacement term should not be medical so that a 
person with limited experience might understand and utilise the term, when the focus group facilitator asked, ‘would you understand the term cogni-
tive function?’ , one participant replied, ‘a lay person wouldn’t’ . One family member suggested ‘my learning style’ , which led to discussion exploring the 
positive utility of viewing the person with dementia as having the capacity to learn ‘are you really trying to find out how they absorb information?’ . 
There was consensus that ‘how I learn’ possessed a powerful mechanism to convey the principles of personhood and citizenship.
Exercises two and three: Personhood - Replacement term for central circle of personhood model denoting ‘staff’ and ‘resident’ . The terms ‘staff’ and 
‘resident’ replaced with one term ‘who am I?’ for both exercises.
Staff broadly expressed terms in exercises two and three should be consistent for staff and the resident. A participant in focus group two implied they 
perceived the assessment of personhood as the same regardless of whether the person has dementia or not ‘I probably looked at this and thought 
of myself before I thought of anyone with dementia’ . A participant in group one also commented that ‘you shouldn’t really talk to people who have 
got dementia any different than somebody who hasn’t got dementia’ . When reviewing these data, the research team concluded that the central circle 
should have the unifying phrase ‘who am I?’ for both staff and residents.
Outside to inside exercise - Simplifying language to emphasise key concepts.
After observing that participants spent much of the focus group reading text related to the original exercises, it was agreed that minimal text should 
be included on the revised PERSONABLE worksheets, with the aim of improving staff engagement with the reflective discussions.
The Pledge - More detail added to the pledge instruction.
After the focus groups concluded, the wording of the pledge was changed from the simple statement ‘For the next 30 days I will’ to ‘Within the next 
30 days I will change one thing about the way I work that may improve my understanding of a resident who has dementia. Or I might introduce 
something from the outside community into the care home’ . This decision was based on feedback in the focused discussion groups that some staff 
might have difficulty thinking of a pledge ‘if they can’t see it, just a few examples and they may come up with’ and ‘if there’s examples there, you can 
sort of say ‘I see where that’s coming from’ and maybe something new’ . The text was adjusted to provide more guidance and some non-specific, and 
general, examples were provided.

inter-relatedness of data collection, reflective staff dis -
cussion, staff adaptions to care and further data collec -
tion, DCM™ has rarely been used, in trials, solely as an 
outcome measure. Even when trials have stated DCM™ 
was used as an outcome measure, the observational data 
remains intrinsically linked to the intervention of reflec -
tive discussion with staff [8].
DCM™ comprises three elements. For every resident 
participant, each of these three elements was recorded 
in 5-min intervals over a 4-h period at baseline and at 
follow-up:
1) Mood and Engagement score: refers to two concepts 
‘mood’ and ‘engagement’ recorded as one value, the 
one with the most potential for resident wellbe -
ing. For example, for a person presenting as very 
engaged in a leisure activity but observed to have a 
neutral mood, the value for the engagement would be 
recorded. Often trials use a DCM™ wellbeing/illbeing 
‘WIB’ score as the primary outcome measure, which 
is the mean of the aggregate mood and engagement 
score for each participant.
2) Behaviour Category Code: there are twenty-three 
different behaviour category codes designed to intri -
cately describe the behaviours of people with demen -
tia. Learning the hierarchy of DCM™ coding of 
behaviours is somewhat complex, in most cases the 
most prevalent behaviour with the greatest potential 
for wellbeing is recorded. For example, if a person is 
observed to be talking (Articulation) whilst walking 
(Kum and go) in equal measure during the 5-min 
time frame, the one with the most potential for well -
being should be recorded.
3) Personal Enhancing or Personal Detracting: DCM™ 
attempts to describe the nature of interactions which 
occur between the staff and those they care for, using 
thirty-four codes split into detracting or enhancing. The 
DCM™ manual states that interactions which are signif -
icant should be recorded, for this study all interactions 
were recorded, for example, even brief fleeting interac -
tions such as nods, or one-word ‘hello’ greetings.
Residential care home staff
Residential care home staff knowledge about personhood 
was measured using the Personhood in Dementia Ques -
tionnaire (PDQ), a tool created and reported as valid and 
reliable by [16]. The tool consists of twenty statements 
that a member of staff can rate, on a seven-point Likert 
scale, between agree strongly (7) and disagree strongly 
(1). How able the staff felt to deal with residents who had dementia was measured using a zero to 100 visual ana -
logue scale (VAS). The VAS scale format has been sug -
gested as an accessible way for people to inductively 
measure a given phenomenon [1].
Randomisation
Cluster randomisation occurred at the level of the care 
home. Block randomisation was used with a block size 
of two. Once two sites had been recruited and baseline 
measures complete, they were randomised by AA, using 
the ralloc command in Stata version 14, on a 1:1 basis 
(PERSONABLE intervention or training as usual).
Intervention
The PERSONABLE dementia workshop was facilitated 
face-to-face in a private room by JC across all interven -
tion sites. In response to phase one focus group data, 
PERSONABLE was designed to be brief, lasting no longer 
than 1 h and fitting into the potentially quiet period after 
staff handover. The workshop comprised of five reflec -
tive exercises, described in phase one results below. 
PERSONABLE required minimal resources other than a 
simple and predominantly illustrative workbook which 
assisted the facilitator when guiding staff participants 
through the PERSONABLE workshop. Staff participants 
in the intervention arm were offered the PERSONABLE 
intervention once per participant. This was a waitlist trial 
and those randomised to the training as the usual group 
were offered PERSONABLE once all follow-up data had 
been collected.
Training as usual
The control group received training as usual. During 
phase one, focus group key data was collected about the 
usual type, content, length and frequency of training as 
usual. These data were collected for staff working across 
multiple roles and indicated that residential care homes 
typically provide (i) mandatory training with limited 
dementia-specific content; (ii) occasional dementia-spe -
cific training usually attended by senior staff and subse -
quently informally disseminated to junior care staff; (iii) 
usually no dementia-specific training for ancillary, main -
tenance and administration staff; and (iv) when dementia 
training is delivered, it does not usually explore principles 
relating to personhood or citizenship.
Follow -up measurements
All follow-up measurements were assessed ten weeks 
post-randomisation to allow time for intervention deliv -
ery and for the staff to complete their pledges, a com -
ponent of the intervention. All measurements taken at 
baseline, at the level of staff and residents, were repeated. 
DCM™ inter-rater agreement was assessed at follow-up 
Page 6 of 12 Corner et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2023) 9:2 
by JC, and a DCM™ mapper independent of the study, 
at one intervention and one training as the usual site. 
The second rater was experienced in the application of 
DCM™ and involved in the training of DCM™ practi -
tioners. The observers took regular breaks to discuss the 
observation and refer to the DCM™ handbook [30]. To 
ensure a true representation of inter-rater agreement, 
even if a consensus was reached after discussion, the ini -
tial observation data was not altered.
Sample size
As the study was not a definitive randomised controlled 
trial the aim of the analysis was not to determine evi -
dence of effect and therefore not powered as such. To 
help ensure the smooth running of trial procedures, 
recruitment was limited to forty residents across the six 
care home sites, and this number was derived from a 4-h 
scoping exercise of DCM™ conducted in a care home 
separate from phase two. There was no limit on staff  
recruitment within the participating homes. Care home 
recruitment was limited to six sites to help ensure mean -
ingful feasibility data could be collected.
Blinding
The person responsible for randomisation (AA) was 
blind to care home identity but blinding of allocation was 
not possible for JC or care home managers and staff. At 
follow-up, attempts were made to blind the second per -
son undertaking DCM™ to study arm allocation. Staff  
and resident participants were assigned a code and JC 
remained unaware of which code represented which 
study arm during analysis.
Analysis
DCM™ mood and engagement are measured on a − 5 to 
+5 ordinal scale. DCM™ denotes a neutral state of mood 
or engagement with a +1 score. The frequency of the 23 
behaviour category codes in each trial arm was explored 
by grouping the individual codes by their potential (high, 
moderate, low or none) for mood or engagement, as 
described in the DCM™ handbook [30]. The no potential 
for wellbeing behaviour code is ‘N’ when a participant is 
asleep, or ‘Land of Nod’ . The use of personal enhancers and 
detractors is descriptive of the nature of the staff interac -
tion rather than a numerical measure of interaction quality. 
There are seventeen personal enhancing staff interaction 
categories and seventeen detracting staff interaction cat -
egories. Usually, these codes are only used when an inter -
action of interest has taken place. However, for this study 
to capture the breadth of interactions across all sites, all 
interactions occurring between staff and residents were 
recorded. Because of the high number of interactions 
anticipated from taking this approach the rating of the thirty-four different interactions was condensed to enhanc -
ing (+ 1) and detracting (− 1). DCM™ data can be con -
verted into a concordance coefficient to describe interrater 
agreement. The concordance coefficient is the percentage 
agreement between different observers for the behaviour 
category codes and mood and engagement scores, across 
the 5-min time frames for which both observers have data.
The PDQ uses a seven-point scale for each of the 20 
items. This scale was adjusted to 0–6 to include a zero 
value. The VAS and PDQ data were reported as a mean 
for each group and data captured for missing cases and 
outcome concordance.
Study data was analysed using the Statistical Package 
for the Social Sciences (version 25). Analysis was pre -
dominantly descriptive in accordance with the feasibility 
design and the study objectives. Staff flow through the 
study was mapped at baseline, intervention delivery and 
follow-up to inform decisions on how future trials might 
weigh recruitment.
Phase two: results
Recruitment and participant flow
Care home Six care homes agreed to take part in the 
study. Twenty-seven care homes from a range of set -
tings and sizes were approached for inclusion in the 
study. The most frequent reason for non-participation 
of care homes was a perceived time burden of research 
participation by managers. This initial reluctance was 
somewhat reduced when managers became aware of the 
PERSONABLE intervention, recognising the training 
as potentially beneficial. Care homes tended to decline 
participation if already participating in another study or 
if study timings coincided with a Care Quality Commis -
sion inspection. All recruited care homes remained in 
the study for baseline and follow-up measurements, even 
when one care home in the PERSONABLE arm lost both 
the deputy and general manager between baseline and 
follow-up measurements.
Staff Of the 168 staff screened for eligibility for 
the study, 154 met the eligibility criteria (Fig.  1); 14 
were working in management positions and therefore 
excluded. Most of the staff lost to follow-up were those 
who had left employment, 13 of whom were from care 
homes in the PERSONABLE arm; 11 of these 13 were 
from the same home, where between baseline and fol -
low-up there was a change in both the general and dep -
uty care home managers. In the training as usual arm 10 
staff were lost to follow-up due to leaving employment, 
a large proportion of these (n =6) were from a small care 
home (n =11 total staff) undergoing a change of manage -
ment. There was a balance between trial arms for staff  
Page 7 of 12
 Corner et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2023) 9:2 
 
who were away from work, on holiday or who had pro -
longed gaps in shifts and therefore missed follow-up 
measurements. Only two participants, both in the train -
ing as usual arm, declined to complete follow-up ques -
tionnaires when they had already completed baseline 
questionnaires.
Residents Of the 148 residents screened for eligibil -
ity for the study, 112 met the eligibility criteria (Fig.  2). 
Before being approached for inclusion, the ability of eli -
gible residents to provide meaningful consent was dis -
cussed with the care home manager. Only two of the 40 
recruited residents were assessed as having the capacity 
to consent to participation in the study. The other 38 resi -
dents were recruited following the use of the consultee 
process. In the training as usual arm, one gentleman was 
initially recruited but no data were collected. They were 
originally reported to have dementia, but it soon tran -
spired his diagnosis had been incorrectly reported.
Four residents were not available at follow-up; one resi -
dent in the PERSONABLE arm was receiving palliative 
care and three residents in one care home in the train -
ing as usual arm had moved to different care homes. 
At follow-up, a resident in a PERSONABLE arm care 
home was recovering from a hip operation but remained 
included in the study because she was being inclusively 
rehabilitated within the communal areas of the care 
home.Groups at baseline Despite the small number of clus -
ters, baseline characteristics for many variables were 
balanced between both arms of the trial (Table  3). Care 
home characteristics of trial arms were mostly equiva -
lent, except for the mean TESS-RC scores, 49.3 for PER -
SONABLE and 38.7 for training as usual homes, indicat -
ing a greater level of environmental care quality in the 
intervention arm. The ratio of female to male residents 
differed between trial arms, with 80% male and 20% 
female residents in the PERSONABLE arm and 45% male 
and 55% female participants in the training as the usual 
arm. This was most likely due to one care home with 
an unusually high proportion of male residents being 
randomised into the PERSONABLE arm. Staff charac -
teristics were similar for gender and work role between 
both arms. Although behaviour category codes for 
high-potential behaviours were balanced between trial 
arms, there were a higher number of medium potential 
behaviours observed in the PERSONABLE (286) than the 
training as usual (179) arm and a much higher incidence 
of behaviours with no potential for wellbeing (sleep) in 
the training as usual arm (152) compared to the PER -
SONABLE arm (46).
Intervention delivery
PERSONABLE was delivered successfully at the three 
sites randomly allocated to receive the training inter -
vention. All care homes requested that PERSONABLE

be delivered during the staff handover period just after 
lunch. Despite the presence of a training intervention 
attracting interest during recruitment, because of organi -
sational pressures, none of the intervention care homes 
felt able to facilitate more than one session of PERSON -
ABLE. One care manager understandably rearranged the 
date of PERSONABLE because of a resident emergency. 
Despite these challenges, of the 69 recruited staff in the 
intervention arm, 29 attended PERSONABLE. Across the 
three intervention sites, care workers (n=20) were most 
predominant in attendance. However, in one care home, 
there were more ancillary staff (n=7) who attended PER -
SONABLE than care workers (n=4).
The content of the PERSONABLE intervention was 
well received; all staff roles were willing to engage in 
reflective conversations about their work. The pledges 
created by staff were thoughtful and largely reflective of 
an understanding of either personhood or citizenship 
theory, twelve pledges were reflective of personhood the -
ory, such as ‘try to chat more about things they have done 
during their life and learn more about them’ . Thirteen 
pledges were reflective of citizenship theory ‘bring in my 
niece and pets to visit more often to cheer up residents’ . 
Pledges did not seem specific to staff role, one member of 
domiciliary staff pledging to ‘give a resident a duster’ to 
encourage resident citizenship by facilitating their sense 
of purpose and role within the care home community. 
This pledge could be seen as simplistic but was firmly rooted in that staff member’s clear understanding of the 
resident’s biography (personhood) and how crucial this 
was to their wellbeing. Only two pledges did not reflect 
either personhood or citizenship and two participants 
declined to complete a pledge.
Types and quality of interactions
During baseline and follow-up DCM™ observations, 
there were a possible 960 five-min time frames for 
which interactions could be recorded. The majority of 
interactions (n =792) recorded during observation were 
‘no interaction’ , and this reflected 82.5% of all observed 
interactions at baseline. At baseline, the proportion 
of enhancing interactions was balanced between the 
PERSONABLE (n =165) and training as usual (n =152) 
arms; however, at follow-up, the PERSONABLE 
(n=177) arm had a much greater amount of enhancing 
interactions recorded compared to the training as usual 
(n=108) arm.
The brief qualitative DCM™ notes for each interaction 
indicated a large proportion of interactions were ‘neutral’ 
in quality (Table  4). These types of interactions were not 
overtly detracting and therefore considered enhancing. 
Examples of these types of interactions were captured 
in the brief DCM™ field notes ‘brought food, nothing 
exceptional’ , ‘offered food, nothing exceptional’ , ‘helped 
to mobilise, nothing exceptional’ , ‘acknowledged, nothing 
exceptional’ or ‘offered drink, nothing exceptional’ .

Interrater agreement
This study attempted to explore the agreement of two 
independent DCM™ observers when they had not previ -
ously undertaken observations together. The two observ -
ers were unfamiliar with each other’s DCM™ practice 
and had not conferred about the measure prior to con -
ducting observations. The two observers JC and JF con -
ducted 4 h of interrater agreement in one intervention and one training as a usual care home. Both JC and JF 
observed the same sample of residents (n=10) across the 
intervention and usual care homes. For the behaviour 
category codes, observers only agreed for 63 out of 339 
time frames, a very low concordance coefficient of 18.6%. 
The two observers had better, but still poor, agreement 
for Mood and Engagement scores, 188 out of 339 time 
frames, a low concordant co-efficient of 55.5%.
Discussion
Recruitment and retention of participants
There was a positive response from care homes, staff and 
residents approached for inclusion in this study despite 
the difficulty in care home recruitment reported by simi -
lar studies [5, 26]. Receptivity to inclusion in the study 
did not seem to be affected by Care Quality Commission 
ratings, with those rated as ‘good’ or ‘requires improve -
ment’ both responding well to approaches for inclusion. 
Those care homes rated as ‘outstanding’ were less recep -
tive; however, they were more likely to already have per -
son-centred training in place [14, 25] and therefore does 
not perceive the intervention as beneficial. Care homes Table 3 Groups at baseline

with changes in leadership, between baseline and follow-
up, also had high attrition of staff, mainly through leav -
ing employment. Comparatively, a care home where the 
owner was integrated into the care routines, for example 
taking residents swimming, retained all staff throughout 
the study period except for one retirement.
Intervention
The level of staff turnover did not necessarily trans -
late into intervention attendance. For example, the care 
home with the least stability of staff and management 
had the highest attendance at PERSONABLE of all three 
intervention sites. In this care home, a senior carer was 
temporarily acting in a managerial position and worked 
closely with the administrator in coordinating attendance 
at PERSONABLE. Despite the brevity of the interven -
tion, care home managers perceived PERSONABLE to 
be burdensome and had a general reluctance to run the 
workshop more than once. This limited how much the 
intervention could integrate the principles of personhood 
and citizenship into the working culture of a care home. 
Some conversations about the intervention between 
attending and non-attending staff were noted during 
DCM™ observation.
Despite the demands of busy care environments and 
PERSONABLE being offered just once at each interven -
tion site, staff were highly receptive to the intervention 
and there was good attendance from participating staff. 
Of the 44 staff randomised to receive the intervention, 
29 undertook the training. Attendance was enhanced 
when administrative staff or a designated care worker 
was engaged in the promotion of PERSONABLE. When 
a manager promoted the workshop in the weeks leading 
up to PERSONABLE, attendance was better; however, 
in this instance, a greater proportion of staff attended 
on their days off. Reasons expressed by staff for attend -
ance on days off were a sense of duty, a willingness to 
learn, interest in research, an assumption that this was 
part of their job and perceived pressure from their man -
ager. However, we are mindful that future research funds 
should either provide for travel expenses for staff attend -
ing training on their days off, or this practice should be 
discouraged at the point of care home recruitment. The 
pledges constructed within PERSONABLE were aimed 
at helping staff to take ownership of the PERSONABLE 
intervention, potentially enabling them to translate their 
understanding of personhood and citizenship into care 
provision. Evidence of pledge enactment was observed 
during follow-up on an individual (personhood) level; 
however, larger changes to the care community (citizen -
ship) were less apparent.Outcome measurements
DCM™ was designed as a practice development tool to 
describe the resident experience and interactions with 
staff to prompt reflective discussion. It is an approach for 
which there is substantial evidence of positive impacts 
[3]. When DCM™ is used as an outcome measure rather 
than an intervention, the reflective feedback element 
is omitted. We found that having too many DCM™ 
behaviour category codes increased the opportunity for 
observer disagreement - JC and the second observer fre -
quently referred to the DCM™ handbook but even after 
discussion would sometimes disagree on the behaviour 
category code. This suggests the need to ensure observ -
ers have adequate time to discuss their interpretation of 
DCM™ guidance prior to conducting observations, so 
that any misunderstandings, or variations from usual 
practice can be addressed. The mood and engagement 
score being combined dilutes the utility of these distinct 
concepts; this duality was observed on many occasions, 
for example, one gentleman was very engaged in a jig -
saw throughout baseline and follow-up measurements, 
despite his facial expression being solemn throughout 
he was given the higher engagement value as per DCM™ 
guidance. The adopted binary approach in this study to 
describe interactions between staff and residents helped 
to efficiently capture the many interactions. In the con -
text of developing DCM™ as an outcome measure intro -
ducing a neutral code would help capture the more 
benign interactions.
Staff participants reported that the Personhood in Demen -
tia Questionnaire was quick to complete and understand. 
Only two questionnaires had notes in the margins, these 
notes were intended to add clarification when a question had 
been perceived by the participant as ambiguous. Seven staff 
who attended PERSONABLE did not have sufficient time 
to both attend the workshop and complete a questionnaire, 
and this is a consideration for the design of a future study. 
Staff reported finding the VAS easy to complete; many ancil -
lary and administrative staff reported that they did not feel 
their work was ‘care’ and sought clarification that the ques -
tion applied to them. The TESS-RC effectively reflected the 
impression of the observer of the general quality of the care 
home; however, the ethical committee requirement that resi -
dent bedrooms and other personal spaces be omitted from 
this measurement may have impacted the overall impres -
sion of the care home and subsequent validity and reliability 
of this measurement tool. Subsequent studies would benefit 
from developing a tool that captures the training that is deliv -
ered within each care home. This would enable researchers 
to be clearer about differences between trial arms due to the 
delivered intervention.

Conclusion
Future trials would benefit from simplification of recruit -
ment strategies, interventions and outcome measure -
ments. Trials can be sympathetic to the demands of the 
residential care environment by balancing the need to 
collect sufficient information to make meaningful conclu -
sions and the potential overburdening of study partici -
pants. The sheer size of the care home population suggests 
that thoughtful and energetic efforts to overcome the 
challenges of research in this complex environment can 
yield high-powered studies that will ultimately improve 
the care of residents. Using a flexible approach that does 
not compromise methodological rigour may improve 
the recruitment and retention of participants. Delivered 
interventions do not necessarily need to be lengthy or 
extensive. In phase one of this study, staff were less enthu -
siastic about the engagement with, and use of, interven -
tions when they did not fit into their busy work routine. 
The parts of this study which did not run to plan were 
those which were not intuitive for participants: the need 
for blinding, the consultee process and the understanding 
of staff that there is a need for both baseline and follow-
up measurements. A greater research presence and higher 
visibility of researchers in all participating care homes may 
help to familiarise residents, owners, managers, staff and 
family members with the steps necessary to undertake 
successful trials. A citizenship approach to conducting 
care home trials may be of benefit. Building a care home 
research ‘community’ could improve the overall accept -
ability of research methods to care homes, staff and in par -
ticular the resident citizens.
