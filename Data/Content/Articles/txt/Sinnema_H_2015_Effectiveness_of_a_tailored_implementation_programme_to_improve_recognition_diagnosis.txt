Abstract
Background: Anxiety and depression are not always diagnosed and treated in primary care as has been
recommended. A tailored implementation programme, which addresses key barriers for change by targeted
interventions, may help to remedy this.
Methods: The effectiveness of an individually tailored implementation programme, additional to standardised
training and feedback on the recognition and treatment of patients with anxiety or depression in general practice,
was examined in a cluster randomised controlled trial. Participants were 46 general practitioners (GPs) from 23
general practices (12 intervention, 11 control) and 444 patients aged 18 years or older (198 intervention, 246
control) who screened positive on the extended Kessler 10. In the control group, GPs received a 1-day training in
guidelines for recognition and stepped treatment for anxiety and depression. Ten months after the training session,
GPs received feedback on their performance over the preceding 6 months. In the intervention group, GPs received
the same training and feedback as those in the control condition; in addition, they were offered support, tailored to
perceived local barriers to change. The support was delivered in the format of peer group supervisions and
personalised telephone consultations. Data were based on an audit of patient records and patient surveys at
baseline and after 3 and 6 months.
Results: The tailored implementation programme led to recognition of a higher proportion of patients presenting
with anxiety and depression (42% versus 31%; odds ratio (OR) = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.01 –2.53), more consultations after
recognition (IRR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.14 –2.78) and did not lead to more prescription of antidepressants (OR = 1.07;
95% CI: 0.52 –2.19) or referral to specialist mental health services (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 0.72 –3.64). Patients in the
intervention group reported better accessibility of care (effect size (ES) = 0.4; p< 0.05) and provision of information
and advice (ES = 0.5; p< 0.05).
Conclusions: A tailored implementation programme may enhance the recognition and treatment of patients with
anxiety or depression. Further development and evaluation of the programme is warranted to determine its
cost-effectiveness.

Background
Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent and have a
negative impact on everyday functioning, cause great
suffering and incur high healthcare costs and costs
associated with reduced productivity [1-3]. In the
Netherlands, most adults who seek help for anxiety or
depression are treated in general practice [4]. Although
clinical guidelines are available [5,6], the management
of these disorders in general practice is often subopti-
mal. Under-recognition of anxiety and depression has
been reported, although m ore severe symptoms may
be more easily recognised [7,8]. Only half the patients
presenting with anxiety a nd depression receive care
which is in accordance with the guidelines for treat-
ment in general practice [9-11]. There is evidence that
adhering to treatment guidel ines would produce better
patient outcomes [12,13], s o improving adherence to
t h eg u i d e l i n e si sa ni m p o r t a n to b j e c t i v e .
A variety of factors may negatively affect adherence to
guidelines for the treatment of anxiety and depression.
There are barriers related to patients, professionals (i.e.
the physicians) and organisations. Many patients do not
acknowledge that they suffer from anxiety or depressive
symptoms, although they may present in general prac-
tice with somatic symptoms instead of mental health
symptoms [14-16]. Even when a psychiatric diagnosis is
made, the patient or general practitioner (GP) may not
perceive treatment as necessary [11]. Barriers to GPs
adhering to the guidelines m ay include problems dif-
ferentiating between ‘normal ’distress and anxiety or
depressive disorders. So me GPs find it difficult to
discuss the factors relevant to diagnosis with patients
[17]. Possible barriers at the organisational level in-
clude insufficient collaboration between GPs and men-
tal health professionals, waiting lists for specialised
mental health services and limited financial incentives
[18,19].
Adherence to guidelines may be improved by interven-
tions which are tailored to prospectively identified local
barriers [20]. Only a few studies have assessed the effect-
iveness of tailored interventions in improving adherence
to guidelines for the management of patients with
depression in primary care [21,22]. In one study, all
participating GPs received an identical intervention, this
study found that GPs in the intervention group were
more likely to diagnose depression and prescribe antide-
pressants, but no effect on health outcomes was detected
[21]. Another study showed that a one-off tailored
intervention based on psych ological theories improved
some outcomes, more specifically suicide risk assess-
ment improved and patients ’depressive symptoms de-
creased [22]. These studies notwithstanding, there is
insufficient data to determine the most effective and
efficient approach to tailoring this type of intervention.Tailoring an intervention may increase or decrease costs,
but we were unable to find reports of economic evalua-
tions of such interventions.
Our hypothesis was that adherence to guidelines for
anxiety and depression —and in consequence patient
outcomes —would be improved by interventions that are
tailored to prospectively identified local barriers affecting
GPs. The identification of barriers to implementation of
guidelines, the development of interventions targeting
these barriers and the application and perceived useful-
ness of the resulting tailored interventions have been
described in detail elsewhere [23]. This is the first study
to determine the effectiveness of tailored interventions
to improve adherence to guidelines for the recognition
of anxiety and depression in general practice. We com-
pared training and feedback for GPs with training and
feedback supplemented by a tailored intervention.
Training and feedback was provided to both groups.
Educational meetings and in less degree feedback are
common strategies used w ith the aim of improving
professional practice and patient outcomes. However,
the effect is most likely to be small and depending on
baseline performance and how they are provided
[24,25]. The rationale to provide the training was that
the GP needs knowledge of the guideline recommenda-
tions in order to be able to adhere to these guidelines.
F e e d b a c kw a sc h o s e nt og i v et h eG Pt h eo p p o r t u n i t yt o
adjust their performance. Besides, the provision of
training and feedback would probably motivate GPs to
participate in the study.
Methods
Study design
This study was a pragmatic, two-arm, general practice-
level cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) [26].
Clusters were general practices (solo practices, group
practices or health centres) in the Netherlands. The
study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of
the Institutions for Mental Health (METiGG; Utrecht,
The Netherlands) in 2009, number NL28350.097.09.
The researchers were independent of the funder
ZonMw.
Randomisation of clusters
The general practices were randomly assigned to the
intervention group or the control group. GPs in both
groups received 1 day of training in recognition, diagno-
sis, stepped treatment and patient education about
anxiety and depression after which randomisation was
performed by an independent statistician. GPs were not
blind to group assignment. Patients were informed about
the project, but did not receive information whether
their GP had been allocated to the intervention group or
to the control group.Sinnema et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:33 Page 2 of 13
Eligibility criteria for clusters and participants
Setting
The study involved 46 GPs in 23 general practices, who
were recruited over a 5-month period from September
2009 onwards. Several recruitment strategies were used:
a random sample of 500 GPs derived from a national
register and all 225 GPs contracted to a particular health
insurance company that made additional payments ( €0.60
cent for each practice-listed patient in 2010 and 2011) re-
ceived a newsletter containing information about the goals
of the study and the accreditation they would receive if
they followed the 1-day training on the use of the guide-
lines. Subsequently, a researcher contacted these practices
by telephone to recommend participation. In addition, in-
formation about the study was published on the website
of the Dutch College of General Practitioners. The inclu-
sion criterion was a willingness to participate in a 1-day
training programme.
Patient sample
All patients aged 18 years or older attending the partici-
pating general practices between September 2010 and
June 2011 received an information letter and an invita-
tion to participate and were asked to complete the ex-
tended Kessler 10 (EK-10).
Patients who screened positive on the EK-10 were in-
cluded in the study. The Dutch EK-10 is a validated in-
strument for screening for anxiety and depressive
disorders in primary care [27]. A screening is consid-
ered positive if the patient scores at least 20 on the
K10 or gives at least one positive response to the five
additional questions about an xiety. Exclusion criteria
as assessed by the GP were suicidal ideation and be-
haviour, dementia and other severe cognitive disorders,
psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, dependence on
alcohol or drugs, a severe, unstable somatic condition
diagnosed by their GP, insufficient knowledge of the
Dutch language to enable accurate completion of the
questionnaires, having received psychological treat-
ment in the 6 months before the start of the study and
having been diagnosed with anxiety or depression by a
GP in the 6 months before the start of the study. Pa-
tients with a positive screening on the EK-10 who had
consented to being contacted were contacted by tele-
phone and given further information about the study.
Patients who met the inclusion criteria received an
information letter, the baseline questionnaire and a
second informed consent form. Inclusion in the study
was confirmed when a patient returned the baseline
questionnaire and gave informed consent for participation
in the study. GPs were not informed which patients had
been included. After the baseline assessment, patients
might have consulted their GP , but it is also possible that
they did not.Interventions
Control group and intervention group
Training GPs in both groups received the same set of
guidelines and, in February 2010, received a 1-day train-
ing session on implementation given by experts in the
treatment of anxiety and depression in primary care and
in the use of clinical guidelines [28-30]. The intervention
focused on four important guideline recommendations
relating to recognition, diagnosis, treatment and patient
education.
Feedback GPs in both groups were asked to complete a
consultation registration form for each patient who com-
pleted the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire
(4DSQ). The form included questions on 4DSQ score,
diagnosis, the treatment indicated and whether the GP
had informed the patient about the diagnosis and
stepped treatment options. The consultation registration
forms were used to provide GPs with feedback about the
number of registered 4DSQs, appropriate diagnoses, treat-
ment allocation and patient education. The feedback was
an evaluative assessment of whether patients had been ap-
propriately diagnosed, treated and educated and was pro-
vided 6 months after the start of the tailored intervention
(December 2010).
1.Recognition of patients with anxiety or depressive
disorders . The 4DSQ may be used to help recognise
anxiety and depressive disorders. This self-report
instrument can be used to distinguish between
stress-related syndromes (termed ‘stress ’,‘burnout ’
and ‘nervous breakdown ’) and psychiatric disorders
(i.e. anxiety and depressive disorders) [ 31].
2.Diagnosis of anxiety disorder or a depressive disorder
in patients scoring above a certain threshold on the
4DSQ . An appropriate diagnosis includes an
assessment of the severity of the disorder: ‘simple ’
or ‘complex ’for anxiety disorder and ‘mild ’or
‘severe ’for depressive disorder.
3.Treatment should be determined by reference to a
stepped care approach [32-34]. Treatment should
be based on the severity of the disorder and
should begin with the least intensive treatment
that may be expected to prove effective. Patients
with a simple or mild disorder should be offered
less intensive intervention; more intensive
treatment options are appropriate for patients
who have failed to respond to low-intensity
interventions and for patients with a complex or
severe disorder.
4.Patient education on anxiety and depression . GPs
should provide patients with information about their
diagnosis and the stepped treatment options for
anxiety and depression.Sinnema et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:33 Page 3 of 13
Intervention group only
Tailored intervention Between June 2010 and June
2011, GPs from general practices randomised to the
intervention group received, in addition to the training
and feedback, interventions that were tailored to pro-
spectively identified local barriers. To provide insight
into the perceived barriers to early recognition of anx-
iety and depression, appropria te diagnosis, appropriate
treatment allocation and patient education, a trained
interviewer carried out a semi-structured face-to-face
interview with all participating GPs. The interview
protocol was developed from a review of studies on
barriers to compliance with guidelines for anxiety and
depression [18,35-37]. Interviews were conducted; at
the time, the baseline for the RCT was taken and
yielded a list of barriers relevant to each GP. Different
barriers were perceived by the GPs to the uptake of
guideline recommendations. GPs ( n= 19) indicated a
total of 84 barriers. Most GPs indicated barriers in (i)
using the 4DSQ ( n= 15), (ii) diagnosing anxiety and
depressive disorders ( n= 13) and (iii) allocating pa-
tients correctly to care, acco rding to the severity of the
disorder diagnosed ( n= 15). Only some GPs perceived
barriers in providing patient information ( n=5 ) . T h e
various barriers were classified according to the themes:
knowledge and skills, attitude, time, patient ’s opinion and
behaviour, collaboration with mental health professionals
and the availability of treatment. To address the barriers
of each GP, various specific tailored interventions were
delivered using two different formats, ‘peer group super-
vision ’and ‘personalised telephone consultation ’.T w o
peer group supervisions, led by a GP of the research
team, were attended by GP participants. The sessions
lasted 2.5 h each. The supervisions focused on barriers
relating to GPs ’knowledge and skills and perceptions of
patient opinions and behaviours regarding diagnosis
and treatment. Telephone consultations targeted the
barriers relevant to individual GPs and covered GP
knowledge and skills, perceptions of patient opinions
and behaviours, time, attitude, collaboration with mental
health professionals and local availability of evidence-
based treatment options. Telephone consultations lasted
15 min and were provided once every 2 months by the
interviewers for 1 year. Interviewers documented local
implementation processes by making notes and offered
advice to the GPs during the follow-up call. When GPs
indicated that strategies for overcoming barriers were
not successful, potential so lutions were proposed to
the GP during the next session. This dynamic feedback
loop involving the interviewer and the GP was used in
an attempt to maximise the effectiveness of the
support offered. The identification of barriers to the
implementation of guidelin es, the development of in-
terventions targeting these barriers and the applicationof the resulting tailored interventions has been de-
scribed in detail [23].
Outcomes
Clinical outcomes on practice level
To examine the effectiveness of tailored interventions to
improve adherence to guidelines for anxiety and depression
in general practice, the primary outcome was the propor-
tion of recognised patients having anxiety or depression by
the GP. Recognition was operationalised as the registration
in the patients ’medical records, during 6 months preceding
and after the EK-10 of terms d escribing (i) psychological
complaints: anxiety, depression, worrying, sorrow or grief,
stress, feeling down, disordered sleeping and unexplained
somatic symptoms; (ii) the International Classification of
Primary Care-1 (ICPC-1) codes [38] for anxiety, depression
and related psychological problem s, i.e. acute stress, feeling
anger or irritation, behaving irritably or angrily, neurasthe-
nia; or (iii) a completed 4DSQ.
In the preparation of the study in February 2010, be-
fore the data collection started, the primary outcome
was changed (with approval of the funder ZonMw in
March 2010), from an outcome on patient level (change
in symptoms of anxiety and depression measured with
the 4DSQ) to an outcome on the level of the cluster
(recognition of anxiety and depression). The reason for
this change was that the primary study aim focused on
the performance of GP ’s in the recognition of anxiety
and depression.
Secondary outcomes at the cluster level were (i) num-
ber of consultations related to anxiety and depressive
symptoms after recognition, (ii) prescription of antide-
pressants and (iii) referral to specialist mental healthcare.
Data on cluster level outcomes were gathered by search-
ing the patient medical records, from 6 months before
until 6 months after completion of the EK-10. The
search was performed by two researchers. To achieve a
high inter-rater reliability, two researchers who were
blind to the group assignment independently assessed 50
medical records, and weighted kappa statistics were cal-
culated. A 5% sampling would be sufficient for a quality
control [39]. The kappa for the primary outcome yielded
an inter-rater agreement of 96% (weighted kappa = 0.91;
95% CI: 0.79 –1.00). The kappas for the secondary out-
comes yielded inter-rater agreements between 92% and
98% (weighted kappas were between 0.66 and 0.89).
Clinical outcomes on patient level
Secondary outcomes at the patient level were gathered
using self-report questionnaires that were sent to the
participants (via the Internet or by post) at baseline
(T0), and 3 (T1) and 6 (T2) months later. These second-
ary outcome measures were used to evaluate the impact
of clinical management.Sinnema et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:33 Page 4 of 13
Severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was mea-
sured with the 4DSQ. The 4DSQ has four subscales re-
lating to common psychopathology: distress, depression,
anxiety and somatisation; high scores correspond to high
symptom levels, and mean scores were calculated for all
four subscales. The distress scale comprises 16 items;
scores range from 0 to 32, a score ≥21 indicates a ser-
ious problem, such as clinically significant psychiatric
disorder. The depression scale comprises six items;
scores range from 0 to 12, a score ≥6 indicates probable
depressive disorder. The anxiety scale comprises 12
items; scores range from 0 to 24, a score ≥9 indicates
probable anxiety disorder. The somatisation scale com-
prises 16 items; scores range from 0 to 32, a score ≥21
indicates a somatic fixation.
Functional status was measured using the World
Health Organisation ’s Disability Assessment Scale II
(WHODAS II) which covers functional impairments in
six domains over the previous 30 days. The standardised
total score, based on 32 or 36 items (36 only if work
items are applicable), corrected for missing values was
calculated [40,41]. The domains are communication and
understanding, getting around, self-care, getting along
with people, life activities (household and work) and par-
ticipation in society. Scores range from 0 to 100; high
scores indicated functional impairment.
Patients ’experience of GP provision of care for mental
health problems was measured with the QUality Of care
Through the Eyes (QUOTE) of the patient scale [42].
The QUOTE consists of six subscales measuring accessi-
bility of care, providers ’emotional support, degree to
which care is patient-centred, quality of care, provision
of information and advice and guidance on self-help. Re-
sponses to items are measured on a four-point scale;
high scores correspond to positive experiences.
Sample size
The rate of recognition of anxiety or depression (primary
outcome measure) was used for the power calculation and
estimated at 45% [7,43]. Previous studies have shown that
interventions targeting medical professionals ’adherence
to guidelines can increase adherence by up to 10% [44].
Based on a review, we assumed that an intensive, tailored
intervention of the type used in this study would improve
recognition of anxiety and depression by as much as 15%
[20]. To detect a 15% difference (60% versus 45%) (alpha
= 0.05; power = 0.80) in recognition of anxiety and depres-
sion between the groups, assuming a 5% attrition rate (loss
to follow-up was minimal because recognition was based
on medical record review) and an intra-cluster correlation
of 0.01 [45], we estimated that a sample size of 396 pa-
tients from 23 practices would be necessary. In an add-
itional file, the covariates in the analyses are described [see
Additional file 1].Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the prac-
tices, GPs and patients. Comparisons between the inter-
vention and control groups were made using ttests for
continuous measures and χ2tests for categorical vari-
ables (without imputation for missing values). These
analyses were performed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 19.0. Outcome variables
were analysed with multilevel regression analyses taking
into account the three-level clustering of observations
(patients within GPs and GPs within practices) [46]. A
fourth level of measurement, within-patients, was added
as the lowest level for the analysis of the longitudinal
data from self-report questionnaires at baseline and 3
and 6 months later. The type of regression model was
matched to the outcome variable: logistic regression was
used for dichotomous outcomes, linear regression for
continuous outcomes and Poisson regression for number
of consultations after recognition of symptoms of anx-
iety and depression.
Stata (version 12) was used for the multilevel regres-
sion analyses. The analyses were assessed according to
intention to treat principles. Multiple imputation with
chained equations (ICE) was used, creating 20 imputed
datasets to compensate for missing values [47]. The im-
putation models included the primary and secondary
outcome variables, group (intervention or control) and
covariates according to the four-step strategy to select
predictor variables described in van Buuren et. al. [48],
namely patient gender and the following GP characteris-
tics: gender, trainer status, psychologists working in the
practice, attitude towards anxiety and depression, collab-
oration with a mental health nurse in primary care and
level of burnout. Effect sizes were assessed for pretest
and posttest effects using a control group design and
standardised by pooled pretest standard deviations [49].
All analyses were prespecified.
Results
Participant flow and numbers analysed
Of 23 general practices recruited, 12 practices (23 GPs)
were randomised to the intervention group and 11 prac-
tices (23 GPs) to the control group. Given the several re-
cruitment strategies, it is not possible to present the
exact recruitment rate. In the intervention group, 8 of
12 were rural practices, 4 practices were located in
urban areas. In the control group four were rural prac-
tices and seven were located in urban areas. Compared
to the Dutch distribution of GPs, it seems that rural
practices are overrepresented [50]. All practices in both
groups participated in the 1-day training session. Of all
GPs, six GPs (26%) from three practices in the interven-
tion group and four GPs (17%) from two practices in the
control group did not participate. In all these cases, GPsSinnema et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:33 Page 5 of 13
working at the same practice promised to pass the infor-
mation on to their absent colleagues. The consultation
registration form was administered by 9 GPs (39%) from
eight practices in the intervention group and 13 GPs
(57%) from six practices in the control group; these GPs
received individual feedback. GPs from 13 practices (7 in
the intervention group) were contracted to a particularhealth insurance company and received the extra fee for
each practice-listed patient in 2010 and 2011.
Five of seven GPs from one practice in the interven-
tion group did not receive the tailored intervention; one
became ill and the others state that they had insufficient
time. In another practice, one of three GPs did not re-
ceive the tailored interventions because of a reported
Figure 1 Flow diagram of progress of clusters and individuals through the phases of the randomised trial.Sinnema et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:33 Page 6 of 13
lack of time. Under the ‘intention to treat ’, principle pa-
tients of all GPs were included in the study, except the
patients of the GP who became ill because this GP saw
no patients. One solo general practice was lost after
10 months because the GP emigrated; the patients of
this GP were not excluded from the study.
A total of 444 patients were included, 198 in the inter-
vention group and 246 in the control group. Primary
outcome data were obtained from 420 of 444 (95%) of
the patients. Secondary outcome data were obtained
from 413 of 444 (93%) of the patients at the 3-month
follow-up (T1) and 404 of 444 (91%) at the 6-month
follow-up (T2). Figure 1 shows the flow of general prac-
tices and patients. Regarding patients, the amount of
missing information does not exceed 10%.
Characteristics at baseline for clusters and individuals
Baseline characteristics for general practices, GPs and
patients are given in Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
Primary outcome measure
The proportion of patients with adequately recognised
and documented anxiety or depression was significantly
higher in the intervention group than the control group
(42% versus 31%). In the intervention group, it was more
likely that anxiety and depression would be recognised
(odds ratio = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.01 –2.53; p= 0.047; see
Table 4). The intra-cluster correlation for the combined
level of general practitioners and practices was 0.02. In
an additional file, the cost per one additional recognised
patient is described [see Additional file 2].Secondary outcome measures
There were no significant differences between the
groups for most of the secondary outcome variables
(proportion of patients who were prescribed antidepres-
sants: odds ratio (OR) = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.52 –2.19; propor-
tion of patients who were referred to specialist mental
health services: OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 0.72 –3.64). In con-
trast, patients whose symptoms of depression and anx-
iety were recognised received significantly more frequent
consultations if their GP was in the intervention group
(mean number of consultations 1.06) than if their GP
was in the control group (mean number of consultations
0.64) (incidence rate ratio 1.78, 95% CI: 1.14 –2.78).
Table 4 provides a detailed description of these data.
Table 5 shows the secondary outcome data at patient
level: scores on the 4DSQ and WHODAS II. There
were no significant differences between the groups on
the 4DSQ distress, anxiety and somatisation subscales;
however, patients in the intervention group showed a
significant additional reduction in depressive symp-
toms at the 3-month posttest (T1, effect size (ES) = 0.2;
p<0 . 0 5 ) .
Table 6 shows the data on patients ’perceptions of the
care they received from their GP for mental health prob-
lems. Patients in the intervention group reported signifi-
cantly more positive experiences of the accessibility of
care (ES = 0.4; p< 0.05) and better provision of informa-
tion and advice (ES = 0.5; p< 0.05) at 6 months than pa-
tients in the control group. There were no significant
differences between the intervention group and control
group in the other four domains (providers ’emotional

Discussion
Statement of principal findings
The results of this study indicate that a tailored inter-
vention was significantly more effective in improving
recognition of anxiety and depression in general practice
than training and feedback alone. GPs in the intervention
group had more frequent consultations with patients
whose anxiety and depression had been recognised than
GPs in the control group, although this did not lead to
more frequent prescription of antidepressants or referral
to specialist mental health services. In addition, patients of
GPs in the intervention group showed an additional re-
duction in depressive symptoms at 3 months comparedwith patients in the control group. However, no significant
difference in depressive symptoms was found at 6 months.
Patients of GPs in the intervention group also reported
significantly more positive experiences of the accessibility
of care and better provision of information and advice
than patients of GPs in the control group. No significant
differences between the groups were found on the other
secondary outcomes.
Strengths and limitations
The use of a systematic intensive tailored intervention to
improve the recognition diagnosis and treatment of anx-
iety and depression in general practice was an important
strength of this study. The study also had some limita-
tions. Firstly, the primary outcome was the recognition
by GPs of anxiety or depression in patients who hadTable 2 Baseline characteristics for GPs in the intervention and control group (Continued)

screened positive on the EK-10. The EK-10 is the pre-
ferred instrument for screening for anxiety and depres-
sive disorders in general practice; however, about one
third of all patients who screened positive on the EK-10
had low 4DSQ scores, indicating that they had few
symptoms and were in fact not suffering from anxiety or
depression. The EK-10 has a specificity of 0.75 for de-
tecting any depressive and/or anxiety disorder. As a
consequence, patients may be included while they did
not have an anxiety or depressive disorder. Given the
recruitment strategy used in our study (all adult pa-
tients from the included general practices who visited
their GP) and a low mean score on the 4DSQ for pa-
tients screening positive on EK-10, the subgroup of pa-
tients with mild symptoms might have affected the rate
of GP recognition of anxiety and depression and the
impact of clinical management. Besides, assuming that
the population only included positive screens, it is not
clear whether the intervention led to over recognition
and false positives. Besides, the relatively small numberof patients who could be screened (compared to the
large numbers who were approached for screening)
and that almost half of these patients screened positive
might indicate selection bias. Secondly, patients started
to enter the study about 4 months after the start of the
tailored intervention. The intervention may have been
more effective for patients when they were included
after the tailored intervention was finished, because at
this point, GPs would have been exposed to the inter-
vention for longer and would have had opportunity to
change their professional practice. Thirdly, six GPs in
the intervention group who did not receive the tailored
intervention were included due to the intention to
treat principle; the pati ents of these GPs received

trol group, diluting potential differences between the
conditions.
Finally, the effect of the intervention on patient out-
comes is unclear, because the study focused on GP
performance.Table 4 Odds ratios for the variable recognition (primary outcome), prescribing antidepressants, referral to specialist

Comparison with existing literature
A previous RCT compared the effectiveness in overcom-
ing obstacles to change in the implementation of guide-
lines for depression in general practice of a tailored
intervention based on psychological theories and simple
dissemination of the guidelines [22]. The tailored inter-
vention was delivered once and results showed that it
increased adherence to some of the guideline recom-
mendations. In our study, the tailored intervention in-
cluded provision of one-to-one telephone consultations
every 2 months for 1 year. This enabled the provision of
dynamic feedback; whenever strategies for overcoming
barriers did not appear to be succeeding, new solutions
were developed and discussed with the GP during the
next consultation. It was hoped that this dynamic feed-
back loop would maximise the effectiveness of the tai-
loring process. In another RCT, the effectiveness of an
intervention to reduce barriers to GPs ’adherence to
recommended standards for recognition and manage-
ment of late-life depression was assessed [21]. GPs in
the intervention group received patient-specific treat-
ment recommendations in three special visits; GPs in
the control group received no intervention. The results
showed that GPs in the intervention group were more
likely to diagnose depression and prescribe antidepres-
sants, but no effect on patient outcomes was detected.
In this study, all GPs received the same intervention,
unlike our study where the specific content of the inter-
vention was tailored to the individual GP.
A systematic review of tailored interventions targeting
identified barriers to change concluded that tailored inter-
ventions are more likely to improve professional practicethan no intervention or simple dissemination of guide-
lines. Our study indicates that training, feedback and a tai-
lored intervention are more effective than training and
feedback. However, reviews have shown that educational
meetings and feedback can also improve professional
practice [24,25].
Interpretation of the findings and implications for future
research
Tailored interventions have been suggested to be a
promising approach to improve adherence to guidelines
relating to recognition and management of anxiety and
depression in general practice. Our study adds to the
evidence supporting the use of such interventions. How-
ever, despite the increased recognition and the provision
of more consultations by GPs in the intervention group,
no effect was seen on the reduction of symptoms and
improvement of functional status. Possible explanations
can be the following: the effect of treatment is too small
to establish, GPs ’treatment cannot improve the natural
course and the treatment is not effective.
In our study, patients with minor symptoms of anxiety
and depression were included. Future research could
focus on determining the effectiveness of the tailored
intervention for patients presenting with more severe
symptoms of anxiety and depression in primary care.
Tailored interventions may be a solution to improve
the uptake of guideline recommendations for anxiety
and depression in general practice, but more research is
needed before large-scale tailored implementation can
be recommended. Also, the cost-effectiveness of the tai-
lored intervention should be studied.Table 6 Predicted mean QUOTE scores and effect size of patients from GPs receiving training, feedback and tailored

Conclusions
We described the effect of a tailored intervention on
adherence to recommended diagnostic procedures and
treatment for patients with suspected anxiety and de-
pression. Our study showed that a tailored implemen-
tation programme may enha nce the recognition of
patients with anxiety or depression. Further develop-
ment of the programme is advisable and to determine
the cost-effectiveness.
