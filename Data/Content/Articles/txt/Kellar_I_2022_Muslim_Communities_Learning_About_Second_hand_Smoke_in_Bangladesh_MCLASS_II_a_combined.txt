Abstract 
Introduction: Deaths from second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure are increasing, but there is not sufficient evidence to 
recommend a particular SHS intervention or intervention development approach. Despite the available guidance on 
intervention reporting, and on the role and nature of pilot and feasibility studies, partial reporting of SHS interventions 
is common. The decision-making whilst developing such interventions is often under-reported. This paper describes 
the processes and decisions employed during transitioning from the aim of adapting an existing mosque-based inter -
vention focused on public health messages, to the development of the content of novel community-based Smoke-
Free Home (SFH) intervention. The intervention aims to promote smoke-free homes to reduce non-smokers’ exposure 
to SHS in the home via faith-based messages.
Methods: The development of the SFH intervention had four sequential phases: in-depth interviews with adults in 
households in Dhaka, identification of an intervention programme theory and content with Islamic scholars from the 
Bangladesh Islamic Foundation (BIF), user testing of candidate intervention content with adults, and iterative interven-
tion development workshops with Imams and khatibs who trained at the BIF.
Results: It was judged inappropriately to take an intervention adaptation approach. Following the identification of 
an intervention programme theory and collaborating with stakeholders in an iterative and collaborative process to 
identify barriers, six potentially modifiable constructs were identified. These were targeted with a series of behaviour 
change techniques operationalised as Quranic verses with associated health messages to be used as the basis for 
Khutbahs. Following iterative user testing, acceptable intervention content was generated.
Conclusion: The potential of this community-based intervention to reduce SHS exposure at home and improve lung 
health among non-smokers in Bangladesh is the result of an iterative and collaborative process. It is the result of the 
integration of behaviour change evidence and theory and community stakeholder contributions to the production

Introduction
Historically, behaviour change intervention content is 
under-reported [1], impacting replicability, subsequent 
development, and scalability. A recent review of second-
hand smoke (SHS) intervention studies [2] indicated 
that partial reporting of SHS interventions is common. 
It was recommended that intervention reporting guide -
lines are adhered to and that comprehensive reporting 
of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and the provi -
sion of a logic model linking BCTs to the intervention 
theory of change is mandated. The need to be pragmatic 
in resource-limited contexts is common in intervention 
development [3]. The decisions taken in these contexts 
and elsewhere may enlighten those seeking to under -
stand what leads to successful intervention development. 
A range of theoretical models and intervention develop -
ment approaches to protect children from SHS [4] have 
been proposed, but recent reviews of smoke-free homes 
(SFH) [5, 6] and of SHS interventions for children [7] 
have not provided the basis for specific recommenda -
tions. Hoddinott [8] suggests that a greater understand -
ing of the effectiveness of interventions will result from 
transparent reporting of how stakeholder groups are 
involved in decision-making during the development 
of complex interventions. This paper describes the pro -
cess of developing the content of a novel mosque-based 
smoke-free home (SFH) intervention in Bangladesh that 
has subsequently been trialled [9].
Key messages regarding feasibility
1) Previous work had identified concerns around the fea -
sibility of developing smoke-free homes messages that 
could be delivered in mosques.
2) Our approach demonstrates it is feasible to develop 
explicitly faith-based messages for use in mosques by 
working iteratively with stakeholder groups from reli -
gious communities.
3) The reported intervention development utilised a 
4-phase process for working with stakeholders from reli -
gious communities to develop faith-based intervention 
content.
Background
SHS is the combination of emissions of smoke emit -
ted between a puff of lit tobacco and the smoke that is 
exhaled by smokers [10]. Children’s risks from asthma 
[11], acquiring lower respiratory tract infections [12, 13], and tuberculosis [14, 15] are all increased by exposure 
to SHS. Children living in smoking households are also 
at high risk of becoming adult smokers later [16]. Child -
hood exposure to SHS is strongly associated with the 
prevalence of adult smoking [17].
Whilst between 1990 and 2006, the estimated num -
ber of deaths attributed to SHS fell, it has subsequently 
increased, driven by increases in SHS exposure in South 
Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific [18]. The WHO esti -
mates that 1.2 million deaths per year are attributable to 
non-smokers being exposed to SHS [19]. This research 
focuses on a setting-based approach [20], focussing on 
engendering a health-supporting environment [21] to 
protect non-smoking adults and children from the harms 
of SHS in their homes. There have been calls for research 
into the efficacy of health interventions that are delivered 
by Imams or in mosques [22, 23]. The work builds on 
the findings of a pilot trial conducted in England which 
concluded that an SFH intervention was acceptable to 
Muslim communities and feasible to deliver in mosques 
[24]. In the present work, the intervention development 
explicitly aimed to result in faith-based material directly 
targeted at smokers via faith leaders based in mosques 
(Imams and khatibs) for the planned trial [25] (MRC 
RGMR/P008941/1).
Methods
Development approach
The starting point of the intervention development 
approach was material arising from the UK-based 
MCLASS trial [26], for which a package of SFH materials 
was developed that drew upon consensus around the reli -
gious prohibition of the use of tobacco products among 
Muslims [27, 28], and evidence that a complex inter -
vention that included a mosque-based component had 
promising effects on SFH prevalence [29]. The MCLASS 
intervention took a settings-based approach, seeking to 
support health-promoting environments. The interven -
tion was tailored to the cultural values of the target popu -
lation: South-Asian men ill-served by smoking cessation 
services that do not address cultural sensitivities [30–32]. 
Relatively few faith setting-based interventions have been 
developed for mosques [33].
A recent UK Medical Research Council (MRC)-
funded project has produced a taxonomy of interven -
tion development approaches for complex interventions 
[34]. This specified eight categories: partnership, target of the intervention content. This novel combination of intervention development frameworks demonstrates a flexible 
approach that could provide insights for intervention development in related contexts.
Keywords: Smoke-free home, Mosque, Intervention development

population-centred, evidence and theory-based, imple -
mentation-based, efficiency-based, stepped or phased-
based intervention specific, and combination. Our 
development work does not fit neatly into this taxonomy, 
in that we had previously undertaken SHS intervention 
development in the UK [26]. We initially expected to 
undertake an intervention adaptation approach using 
the Programme Theory of Adapted Health Interven -
tions [35] making use of the UK-based MCLASS trial 
materials [26]. However, subsequent process evaluation 
of the existing intervention [24] raised issues around the 
acceptability of religious teachers taking on a health pro -
motion role, and it was reported that some participants 
were unhappy that the mosque was being used as a con -
text for delivering health promotion messages:
When you come to the mosque, you want to pray, 
you know? And [its’] a place of worship really. And 
you don’t want to come here and do other things you 
know? You want to escape from these things you see. 
(FGD-Men) (p.300)
We subsequently looked to ayah (Quranic verse) for 
messages that supported SFH so that the messages were 
drawn from the Quran and would not be jarring for 
worshippers or out of place in mosques. Given the lim -
ited expertise of we in the Quranic scripture, it was felt 
important to undertake an intervention development 
process that examined the wider context of smoking and 
SFH, and following content development, put this before 
stakeholder groups in Bangladesh for iteration, includ -
ing those with a scholarly understanding of Quranic 
scripture.
We elected to undertake a development process that 
consisted of four phases:
1) Interviews exploring barriers and facilitators of SFH 
with adults from locations near the planned recruit -
ment sites.
2) Identification of an intervention programme theory 
and content with Islamic scholars from the Bang -
ladesh Islamic Foundation (BIF) with expertise in 
Quranic scripture to identify candidate content
3) User testing of candidate intervention content with 
adults.
4) Iterative intervention development workshops with 
Imams and khatibs.
Phase 1—Interviews exploring barriers and facilitators 
of SFH
Face-to-face interviews were conducted from May to July 
2017 in the Mirpur and Gulshan regions of Dhaka city 
with six men and two women (see Table 1).Drawing upon prior work [36–38] and a relevant sys -
tematic review and thematic synthesis [39], a semi-
structured interview schedule that explored smoking 
behaviours, and barriers and facilitators to an SFH inter -
vention delivered within mosques by Imams was devel -
oped. Given the aforementioned process evaluation [24] 
had identified issues around the acceptability and feasi -
bility of the use of mosques to disseminate SHS messages, 
we took this opportunity to elicit opinions on this. Inter -
views lasted between 23 and 48 min. They were audio-
recorded and fully transcribed then translated from 
Bangla to English. The interview data were then analysed 
using deductive content analysis [40]. First a categorisa -
tion matrix was developed based on the interview sched -
ule, piloted with one transcript, and set up in Excel. The 
data were coded to the matrix, and then, each category, 
e.g., smoking behaviours, was written up.
Phase 2—Identification of programme theory and content
The basis for the programme theory to guide the devel -
opment of the content targeting SFH was planned to be 
selected following the face-to-face interviews. The aim 
was to identify evidence-based modifiable constructs pre -
sent within the interview findings and map these to BCTs 
[41] that seemed likely to result in changes in those con -
structs based on study team expertise. These BCTs were 
then operationalised as intervention content with the 
support of Quranic verses (ayahs) and linked health mes -
sages. To seed the programme content design process, we 
sought advice from a Muslim colleague with knowledge 
of social cognitive constructs and the BCT taxonomy 
[41] as to relevant ayahs that supported health messages 
that could operate as the basis for BCTs. These were fed 
into the Arabic Quranic Search Tool, which is a semantic 
search tool for the Quran based on a Quranic ontology Table 1 Interview participant characteristics (n=8)

[42] to identify a long list of ayahs which matched related 
concepts. To select from these ayahs and messages, we 
collaborated with Islamic Scholars from the Bangladesh 
Islamic Foundation, a government organisation under the 
Ministry of Religious Affairs in Bangladesh whose role is 
to spread the values and ideals of Islam among people. 
The long list of ayahs was screened for those that mapped 
on to social cognitive constructs within our interven -
tion programme theory. As such, these were ayahs that 
would support health messages that function as BCTs or 
prompts to perform BCTs that would potentially result 
in changes to the intervention programme theory con -
structs. Subsequently, these ayahs were then expanded 
upon into statements that could form the suggested basis 
for a Khutbah (sermon)—the time before Arabic Khut -
bah during Friday Jumu’ah prayers. The health messages 
connected ayahs to personal implications for individuals’ 
faith and tobacco use.
Phase 3—User testing of candidate intervention content
To test the understanding and acceptability of the 
selected ayahs and health messages, we employed a user 
testing methodology [43] using face-to-face interviews. 
This occurred between September and November 2017 
in the Mirpur region of Dhaka. All 12 ayahs and associ -
ated health messages were tested with a small sample of 
men and women (n=6, see Table  2) within the communi -
ties where we planned to trial the intervention.
For each pair of ayah and health messages, the 
researcher read out the ayah and asked the participant 
what this meant to them. The health message was subse -
quently read to them, and questions probing their under -
standing were asked, including how the message linked 
to the ayah. Feedback on the clarity of wording and sug -
gestions for improvement were also sought. Interviews lasted between 40 and 70 min. Data analysis was as 
described in phase 1.
Phase 4—Iterative intervention development workshops 
with Imams and khatibs
The iterative workshops were undertaken in two sessions 
(labelled A and B) with Imams/khatibs from 12 mosques 
(see Table  3). Imams are those who lead everyday prayers 
in the mosques. Khatib or khateebs are those who deliver 
Khutbah and lead the Friday prayers. All of the Imams/
khatibs were attendees of the Imam Training Academy, 
Bangladeshi Islamic Foundation, part of the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs.
We employed the same user-testing methodology 
applied in Phase 3 [43]. Experience of, and views on, 
delivering health and behaviour change messages within 
their religious teaching were also discussed. The two 
workshops lasted 180 min each. Data analysis was as 
described in Phase 1.

Smoking behaviours
There was typically one smoker in each participant’s 
home, often the interview participants themselves. The 
number of times they smoked in the home ranged from 
one to eight times a day, usually in the morning and at 
night, during the day the men were out at work. Some 
said that they try to smoke on the balcony or in an empty 
room, which was difficult for the three families who live 
together in one room. Only one smoker claimed to never 
smoke in the home.
I felt that the smoke will be harmful for my family 
members and I stopped smoking inside home. (P01:

Barriers and drivers to achieving an SFH
Whilst all interview participants knew of the risks of 
smoking to the smoker, knowledge of the dangers of 
SHS varied and was better among the more educated, 
although they still underestimated the extent of poten -
tial harm.
I know that it harms equally others who are 
around someone who is smoking. That is why I 
have quit smoking at home totally now. (P01: 
Male, 35 years, Smoker, highly educated)
The consensus was there were no disadvantages of 
having an SFH. Participants identified multiple ben -
efits, mentioning particularly the positive impact on the 
health of family members, especially children. Indeed, 
this was seen to be the key motivator. Other benefits 
were seen to be eliminating the smell and improving 
air quality in the home, reducing the risk of an acci -
dental fire and sons not copying their father’s smoking 
behaviour.
Everyone loves their children. People would be 
ready to do anything for the betterment of their 
children. If they stop smoking at home then the air 
of that house would not be polluted. Wives and 
children of smokers will be able to inhale clean air 
and they will remain healthy. There would not be 
any bad smell of cigarette smoke in clothing. The 
overall environment of home will remain very 
good. (P07: Male, 36 years, Smoker, moderately 
educated)
The key challenge to achieving an SFH was smok -
ers ignoring requests to smoke outside the home. Sev -
eral men acknowledged this, whilst one woman spoke 
of how it would be difficult for women to ask men to 
smoke outside, suggesting they may not listen or worse, 
react angrily. She hoped the men would be motivated 
themselves.
She tells me not to smoke inside home, she has told 
me. Then, sometimes, I stop smoking inside home, 
then maybe after a few days, I start smoking in 
the home again, you know. (P07: Male, 38 years, 
Smoker, not educated)
Motivating and convincing the smokers would be a 
challenge, I think. As in our society men are often 
dominating, it is not likely that all of them will 
listen, some of them may get angry hearing such 
things. In some families there might be conflict. If 
the smokers are motivated enough by themselves, 
it would be better. (P08: Female, 45 years, Non-
smoker, highly educated)Acceptability and feasibility of a mosque‑based SHS 
intervention
All the interview participants thought it was a good 
idea to educate people about SHS through mosques 
because of the credibility and influence of the Imam 
as a religious leader, and the mix of people who would 
hear the messages. Most had not heard health messages 
in the mosque before.
Those who have faith in religion go to the mosque, 
that’s why normally they should abide by the rules 
and regulations of the religion. As the Imam is a 
religious leader, people listen to him and discuss 
problems with him, if he talks about smoking, some 
people will definitely listen to those messages. (P01: 
Male, 35 years, Smoker, highly educated)
People who go to the mosque regularly and on 
time are mostly guardians from families, the 
young generation like us are less in number. So, 
by them (these guardians) these kinds of messages 
can spread to others. Another thing would be best 
if we can make women in our homes more aware 
and they will definitely be able to make sure that 
nobody smokes at home. (P06: Male, 34 years, 
Smoker, moderately educated)
The consensus was that the content of the messages 
would need to be tailored to the audience. Women and 
children would need knowledge about SHS to persuade 
family members not to smoke inside and to protect 
themselves from smoke, whereas the men would ben -
efit from learning about SHS in the context of Islamic 
scripture.
Women also need awareness. They will then tell the 
smoker family members not to smoke inside home. If 
children get to know the harms of SHS they would 
then try to protect themselves from second-hand 
smoking. (P07: Male, 38 years, Smoker, not edu -
cated)
The messages should vary. In the mosque the Imam 
can tell people about these (messages) with hadiths 
and Quran teachings. But for women there can be 
other things. For children the message should be in 
such form that they can communicate with their 
parents. (P02: Male, 40 years, Smoker, limited abil -
ity to read)
In terms of feasibility, the time before Arabic Khutbah 
(when the largest proportion of a mosque’s congregation 
attends) was seen as the sensible time to deliver the mes -
sages as most men attend then, thus maximising the size 
of the audience.
Page 6 of 16 Kellar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:136 
We, poor people, rich people, everybody goes to 
Jum’ah prayer. It’s like the Eid day. Old people, 
younger people, small children gather together. So, 
it would be good delivering these messages during 
Jum’ah prayer. Everybody will listen and give impor -
tance. (P05: Female, 42 years, Smoker, not educated)
Other ideas for message delivery were Quran classes 
(for children), Madrasa classes, and other congregations 
like Milad mahfil (a custom practised by many Muslims 
as an expression of reverence for Prophet Muhammad 
(PBUH)) and Waz mahfil (Islamic sermon in the commu -
nities) although these were acknowledged to reach fewer 
people and occur less frequently.
Phase 2—Identification of programme theory and content
Based on the evidence of the previous utility of the model 
for understanding and intervening on smoking behav -
iour [44, 45], we selected the Theory of Planned Behav -
iour, extended with action planning and coping planning 
as the starting basis for the programme theory to guide 
the development of the intervention content (see Fig.  1) 
targeting SHS. The constructs we sought to operational -
ise drawn from this model were Attitude, Social Norms, 
Intention formation, Self-efficacy, Action Planning, and 
Coping planning. Using the interview findings and the 
selected constructs from the programme theory, a Mus -
lim colleague with knowledge of social cognitive con -
structs and the BCT taxonomy [41] supplied a list of 
ayahs that could support messages to promote change in 
these potentially modifiable constructs that were iden -
tified as being present within the interview. The pro -
gramme theory constructs findings were then mapped 
to BCTs [41] that seemed likely to result in changes in 
those constructs based on study team expertise and sub -
sequently result in change in air quality (AQ) and smoke-
free home (SFH) status. The list of ayahs, the constructs targeted, the health messages, and the BCTs the health 
messages were mapped to is contained in Table 4.
Phase 3—User testing of candidate intervention content 
results
All participants understood the general meaning of 
the ayahs and the health messages as well as the links 
between the two. Small edits to the precise wording 
of some of the public health messages were made, to 
improve comprehension; for example, for the message 
linked to Ayah Sura At-Takaathur (see Table  4, ayah 4), 
the concept of “worldly pleasure” was unclear to some 
leading to a suggestion to reword this. No major changes 
were deemed necessary at this stage.
Phase 4—Iterative intervention development workshops 
with Imams and khatibs Imams’ experience and views 
of delivering health promotion messages
There was a view among the Imams that they talk about 
health-related issues in the mosques only when directly 
relevant to religion, for example, addiction to smoking 
or alcohol or eating good foods; or when prompted by a 
current public health issue such as an outbreak of disease 
where they may advise on disease prevention strategies.
Addiction and smoking are sometimes discussed in 
mosques because it is destroying our children and 
adults, taking them away from Allah. There are 
young people who are always behaving badly to 
their parents. They are acting unaware of the conse -
quences both in this world and the hereafter. (B07: 
Imam, khatib and Principal)
Allah has even told us to eat pleasant foods... Drugs, 
smoking, these are already Haram by Allah’s law 
and moreover there are unpalatable, stinky food, 
which is why these are harmful for health. (A06: 
Imam)

5th Self-efficacy (prompt action

The fact is that Allah does not 
change a people’s lot unless 
they themselves change their 
own characteristicsYou can trust Allah to help 
you, but to receive that sup -
port, you must take a step 
by yourself in faith. Trust that 
Allah will give you everything 
you need.
You can feel it difficult to 
quit smoking at home. But if 
YOU cannot make this simple 
change of behaviour for the 
sake of your family members, 
how can you expect Allah will 
help them in other ways? So, 
you need to make a plan that 
if you feel like smoking when 
you are at home—then leave 
the house before you light it.3.1. Social support (unspeci-

A few days ago, city corporation people came to 
us and told us to talk on Chikungunya in Jumu’ah 
prayers. So, we did this. (B03: Imam and khatib)
The exception was during Ramadan when there is more 
emphasis on changing people’s “bad” behaviours and 
helping them to focus more on praying to Allah.
They were generally motivated to deliver health mes -
sages in mosques and familiar with including messages 
during Khutbah in Jumu’ah prayer about behaviours 
that harm people both physically and spiritually. Educat -
ing men about the risks of smoking and SHS was seen 
as a good idea, particularly as people rarely learn about 
SHS, so the intervention was considered to represent an 
opportunity, with the input of international researchers 
seen as an asset. Additionally, this perceived scientific 
foundation of the intervention was seen as important as 
Imams did not consider themselves experts on public 
health, rather their expertise was in spiritual matters.
Actually, you have to pray to Allah from Dunya (this 
world). After death, there is no chance for earning 
good deeds. So, for earning good deeds, the first con -
dition is Haya (life). Abstaining from addiction what 
Allah prohibited and what the prophet (PBUH) 
did and encouraged us to do, if we follow those, the 
Hayat will increase. (A01: Imam)
If we can tell them about some medical facts on 
smoking along with religious messages on it, they 
will be more aware of it. (B04: Imam)
We have both indirect and direct smoking here which 
is very bad. People do not hear much about second-
hand smoking from anyone I guess. (B02: Iman and 
Teacher)
So, if we get a booklet or guideline including infor -
mation on medical science, and if the messages are 
included by studying Quran and Hadith, then these 
will be more acceptable. People will understand that 
not only Imams know about Quran and Hadiths but 
also are knowledgeable of other fields. (A02: Iman 
and khatib)
They were also happy to deliver messages about plan -
ning, attempting, and failing to change behaviours, 
observing that people are used to this, and Islam teaches 
them how to face such situations, with Imams seen as a 
trusted source of support.
I think this is a great opportunity for Imams and 
common people because thousands of people can be 
reached with these messages and thus, Imams can 
make more people aware. (A05: Imam and khatib)Jumu’ah prayers on Fridays was seen as the most appro -
priate time to deliver the messages, as this is when there 
are large numbers of people in the mosque, and they 
have time to elaborate on the meaning. There was a view 
among some that it would be important to deliver a mes -
sage one week, discuss it the next week, and then return 
to it several weeks later as a reminder.
Feedback on ayahs and health messages
Imams were keen to undertake a careful check of the 
selected ayahs and proposed links with health messages. 
Some wanted more time outside of the workshop to do 
this work, whilst others advised that alims (Islamic schol -
ars) should review the final list of ayahs and associated 
health messages.
There was agreement that the same ayahs and linked 
public health messages were appropriate for all mosques. 
The Imams’ suggestions for the 12 ayahs (listed in 
Table  4) are summarised below. The consensus across 
both workshops was that ayahs 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 were 
appropriate and that ayah 4 was not suitably linked to 
the public message, although no one had an idea for a 
replacement. For the others, suggestions for alternatives 
were offered. These were usually to avoid misinterpre -
tation or strengthen the take-home message. For two 
ayahs, changes were proposed to correct the meaning in 
the context of Islamic scripture.
Ayahs 1 and 10 were considered by some Imams to be 
open to misinterpretation. For Ayah 1, there was some 
concern that people might think that smoking is ben -
eficial. Ayah 10 was seen as confusing about the type of 
knowledge being referred to; it should be understood to 
be knowledge of religion not knowledge of the harms 
of SFH. For ayahs 6 and 12, some Imams wanted to 
strengthen the message about the forgiveness of Allah. 
Alternatives for ayah 8 were offered to further encourage 
people to change their smoking and second-hand smoke 
behaviours by emphasising the importance of following 
the life and guidance of the prophet.
The two ayahs that were questioned in terms of reli -
gious accuracy were 2 and 11. For ayah 2, precision was 
needed that it is the Imam (not the scientist) who has 
authority to advise on what harms and heals to be con -
sistent with the laws of Sariah. For ayah 11, the selected 
ayah was referring to divorce hence inappropriate.
As a result of the workshops, half the Ayahs were 
replaced with different Ayahs that better conveyed 
the messages or were more closely related to the pub -
lic health messages targeted to be delivered. Ayahs 1, 6, 
8, 10, 11, and 12 were changed. Ayahs 1, 8, 10, 11, and 
12 were replaced with Ayahs suggested by the scholars 
of the Islamic Foundation, Bangladesh, and Ayah 6 was 
Page 13 of 16
 Kellar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:136 
 
replaced with another Ayah chosen by ARK researchers 
(see Table columns 6 & 7).
Format of the intervention content
The final version of the intervention was formatted as 
a booklet for Imams that contained the Arabic ayah, a 
translation into Bangla, and the related health message 
(see Fig. 2 for examples translated into English).
The intervention booklet finally contained 12 ayah and 
related health messages in total (see Table  1 columns 6 & 
7). Training on delivery of the intervention was provided 
over a half-day and was supported by a training manual. 
Training materials are available at [https:// www. york. ac. 
uk/ healt  hscie nces/ resea rch/ public- health/ proje  cts/ mclas  
s11/# tab-3]. Imams or khatibs in the mosques that were 
randomised to deliver the SFH intervention received 
copies of the intervention booklet to distribute to their 
congregation members after Friday Jumu’ah prayers or in 
study circles. Intervention delivery started immediately 
after training and continued for 12 weeks. Full details of 
the trial procedures have been previously published [9].Discussion
The intervention development process reported here 
primarily took an evidence and theory-based approach 
[34], based on the MRC Framework [46, 47], in common 
with multiple approaches to intervention development 
[48]. Additionally, we took a partnership approach and 
engaged with stakeholder groups to both generate ideas 
about components and features of the intervention [49] 
and make decisions about the content, format, and deliv -
ery of the intervention [48]. As such, this was a combina -
tion approach to intervention development [34].
Summary of this approach
In accordance with MRC guidance [46], considerable 
resources were invested to develop an intervention with 
a conceivable intervention effect on SFHs. This process 
benefitted from intervention development that had pre -
viously been undertaken as part of the UK MCLASS trial 
[1, 24, 26], as well as intervention development work 
that preceded this [29]. The four phases undertaken 
were resource-consuming. However, each phase either 
directly or indirectly supported the creation or adaption 
Fig. 2 Examples of pages of the intervention booklet (translated into English)
Page 14 of 16 Kellar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:136 
of intervention content, with interviews exploring bar -
riers and facilitators of SFH with adults, subsequent 
identification of an intervention programme theory and 
population of initial content with Quranic scripture, user 
testing of candidate intervention content with adults that 
resulted in minor changes to aid understanding, and iter -
ative intervention development workshops with Imams 
and khatibs that resulted in major changes to the con -
tent to better reflect Islamic scholarship. The paucity of 
evidence as to effective SFH interventions [5, 6], and the 
previously highlighted concerns about intervention con -
tent [24], provided the impetus to appropriately support 
engagement with stakeholders to understand the reli -
gious and socio-cultural sensitivities of promoting SFH 
in a mosque setting [30, 50]. This approach reflects calls 
to conceptualise stakeholder involvement as an ongo -
ing, iterative process [51, 52], and represents the efforts 
to develop shared terminology, successful prioritisation 
of early and consistent engagement, and recognition of 
stakeholders’ contributions [53].
Limitations
This intervention has subsequently been trialled [9] and 
found not to be effective in reducing household SHS 
exposure compared with usual services. However, further 
process evaluation and analysis of secondary outcomes 
[25] is planned that will explore effects on hypothesised 
intervention casual pathways and intervention fidelity 
[54].
We benefited from generous support from colleagues 
with deep knowledge of ayahs, social cognition models, 
and/or the behaviour change technique taxonomy [41]. 
Additionally, access to the Quranic Search Tool [42] pro -
vided a starting point for engagement with faith lead -
ers that would have been difficult to replicate without 
significant external support. The ease with which these 
resources can be replicated is not obvious but speak to 
the necessity to properly resource intervention develop -
ment and/or adaptation activities in culturally sensitive 
settings [53].
This work predates a landmark series of studies [55–
57] that triangulated evidence for links between social 
cognitive constructs and BCTs [41]. Whilst prior to 
the availability of the Theory and Technique Tool that 
resulted from these studies, it was typical as part of an 
intervention development process to make use of study 
team expertise to map social cognitive constructs identi -
fied through qualitative or quantitative inquiry to BCTs, 
and this is a less robust method than the evidence syn -
thesis and expert consensus approach that provided the 
data that is now available to support the mapping of such 
links. As such, the BCT mapping upon which we based 
our selection of ayahs may be less than optimal.Conclusion
This religious community-based intervention to reduce 
SHS exposure at home and improve lung health among 
non-smokers in Bangladesh is the result of an itera -
tive and collaborative 4-stage process. It makes use of 
behaviour change theory to support faith-community 
contributions to the production of culturally sensitive 
intervention content suitable for a mosque-based setting. 
Whilst further process evaluation is necessary to under -
stand its failure to affect SHS [9], this novel combination 
of intervention development framework components 
demonstrates a flexible approach that could provide 
insights for intervention development in related cultur -
ally sensitive contexts that could support health behav -
iour change.
