Abstract
Background: Despite the known benefits of healthy eating in childhood, few Australian childcare services provide
food that is consistent with dietary guidelines. The effectiveness of a web-based menu planning intervention to
increase childcare service provision of healthy foods and decrease provision of discretionary foods in long day-care
services in Australia was assessed in a randomised controlled trial. Here we consider the costs, consequences, cost-
effectiveness and budget impact of the intervention using data collected within the trial.
Methods: The prospective trial-based economic evaluation involved 54 childcare services across New South Wales
(NSW), Australia. Services were randomised to a 12-month intervention or usual care. The intervention involved
access to a web-based menu planning and decision support tool and online resources. Effectiveness measures
included mean number of food groups, overall menu and individual food group compliance with dietary
guidelines, and mean servings of food groups at 12 months. Costs (reported in $AUD, 2017/18) were evaluated
from both health sector and societal perspectives. The direct cost to support uptake of the intervention was
calculated, as were costs to each childcare service. The incremental cost of the intervention was calculated as the
net difference in the cost to undertake menu planning and review plus the direct cost of the intervention.
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) including uncertainty intervals were estimated for differences in costs
and effects between intervention and control groups. A relative value index was calculated to determine overall
value for money.
Results: Over the 12 months of the trial, we calculated a difference in cost between usual practice and intervention
groups of −$482 (95% UI −$859, −$56). While the measured increase in menu and food group compliance within
the trial did not reach statistical significance, there were significant improvements in mean servings of fruit and
discretionary food, represented in the cost-consequence analysis. The calculated relative value index of 1.1 suggests
that the intervention returns acceptable value for money for the outcomes generated.

Background
Obesity in early childhood, defined by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) as 0 to 8 years of age [ 1], is associ-
ated with a range of adverse social and health outcomes
for children and the community. In 2016, the WHO esti-
mated the number of overweight children under the age
of five to be over 41 million [ 2]. Childhood obesity also
represents a significant economic burden. In a recent re-
view, Finkelstein and colleagues estimated the incremen-
tal lifetime per capita medical cost of an obese child in
the USA relative to a normal weight child to be $12,660
to $19,630 (2012 USD) [ 3]. An Australian study esti-
mated the direct healthcare costs of children with obes-
ity aged 2 –4 years to be 1.62 (95% CI 1.12 –2.34, p=
0.01) times those of healthy weight children [ 4,5]. The
annual direct costs to the Australian healthcare system
of early childhood obesity was calculated to be around
$18 million ($2018 AUD) [ 4]. Two paediatric simulation
studies in Germany [ 6,7] considered the economic im-
pact of childhood overweight and obesity, estimating
total lifetime costs of €1.8 billion (2010) for the current
prevalent population.
There are strong economic arguments for targeting
early childhood obesity to reduce the economic and so-
cial burden of obesity-related chronic disease across the
lifespan. Dietary behaviour is a key driver of unhealthy
weight gain in children [ 8]. Since dietary behaviours
from early childhood are known to track into adulthoodContributions to the literature
/C15Research has shown that there is very limited health
economic evaluation applied to public health
implementation-interventions, potentially resulting in under-
investment in health promoting programmes.
/C15We found there is value to both decision makers and
researchers in measuring and valuing costs even when trial
outcome results are modest.
/C15These findings contribute to recognised gaps in the
literature, including the measurement of the opportunity
cost of implementation-interventions and the value of eco-
nomic evidence to support decision-making in health.[9,10], it is recommended that population health initia-
tives target improvement in the healthy eating behav-
iours of young children to prevent the onset of obesity
[2].
On average across Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) countries, around
33% of children aged 0 –2 are enrolled in early childhood
education and care services. For children aged 3 –5 years,
the enrolment rates are generally higher. In the majority
of OECD countries, over 80% of children aged 3 –5 are
enrolled in early childhood education and care or pri-
mary school, with an average enrolment rate of 86.3%
[11]. In Australia, approximately 61% of Australian chil-
dren aged 0 –5 years attend a service-based form of early
childhood education and care [ 12]. These data suggest
that childcare services are an appropriate setting for in-
terventions designed to influence healthy eating behav-
iours in childhood, given the access they have to large
numbers of children aged under 5 years, coupled with
children consuming a substantial proportion of their
overall energy intake in these settings [ 13]. In Australia,
the provision of food in early childhood services is regu-
lated and should be provided consistent with national
dietary guidelines. However, international and Australian
research has found that amongst services that provide
food, menu dietary guidelines are poorly implemented
[14–16]. Improving the implementation of dietary guide-
lines in childcare services represents a considerable chal-
lenge. Previous trials testing implementation support
strategies such as the provision of educational materials,
face-to-face meetings and/or audit and feedback for
childcare cooks have demonstrated variable improve-
ments in guideline adherence [ 15,17–20]. In the context
of resource constraints and escalating healthcare costs,
interventions need not be merely effective. They also
need to be cost-effective and affordable to allow policy
makers to select value-based programmes to be dissemi-
nated at scale. Previous interventions have been labour
intensive involving significant face-to-face support and
dietitian-led assessment of menu compliance [ 18,21–
23]. For this reason, web-based interventions are likely
to deliver greater value, if proven effective.
Recent systematic reviews have shown that economic
evaluation is rarely applied to public health
implementation-interventions, and the generation ofReeves et al. Implementation Science            (2021) 16:1 Page 2 of 12
economic evidence has been identified as a priority for
the field of implementation research [ 13,24,25]. Invest-
ment in implementation has an opportunity cost. That
is, the resources could be put to another use, the value
of which is given up. To ensure the efficient and equit-
able allocation of resources, as well as affordability, it is
important to include measures of cost, alongside analysis
of intervention consequences [ 26]. Cost-consequence
analysis (CCA) has been recommended for complex
public health interventions, such as implementation in-
terventions, which are difficult to measure in a common
outcome unit [ 26,27]. CCA is differentiated from cost-
benefit analysis or cost-utility analysis in that it does not
attempt to summarise outcomes in financial terms or in
a single metric such as the quality-adjusted life year
(quality-adjusted life year). Rather, outcomes are shown
in their natural units, and decision makers can deter-
mine for themselves whether the intervention is worth
the investment [ 28]. The disadvantage is that without a
clear decision rule, value determination is subjective and
may lack transparency. Cost-effectiveness analyses
(CEA) compare costs with natural units such as life
years, number of foods served or number of cases
averted, to provide an estimate of economic efficiency
[29]. Providing these data enables comparison between
interventions and allows decision makers to select strat-
egies that will have the greatest impact given available
resources [ 29]. To address gaps in the economic evi-
dence, an economic evaluation was conducted alongside
a randomised controlled trial of a web-based interven-
tion to improve childcare service implementation of
dietary guidelines. The economic evaluation was con-
ducted with the dual aim of providing a valuation of the
investment required to execute implementation-
interventions in community settings and also to generate
economic evidence analysis to permit a determination of
value for money and inform the cost to scale-up the
intervention. Both health sector and a modified societal
perspective are presented as reference case analyses as
recommended by the Second Panel on Cost-
effectiveness in Health and Medicine [ 30].
Methods
Trial design, setting and sample
The study was a single-blinded parallel group rando-
mised controlled trial undertaken with childcare services
within New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Details of
the trial protocol have been published elsewhere [ 31]. In
summary, the sample of 54 services was drawn from a
pool of 252 long day care services in NSW that both
provided food to children in care and were current cli-
ents of a single specific childcare management software
(CCMS) provider. The intervention involved access to a
web-based menu planning and decision-support tool.Eligible services had to meet the following require-
ments: (i) be open for ≥8 h each weekday; (ii) prepare
and provide at least one main meal and two snacks to
children onsite each weekday; (iii) have autonomy to
make menu planning decisions within the service and;
(iv) have a staff member responsible for menu planning
(menu planners) with sufficient English to engage with
the intervention. Excluded services were those that out-
sourced menu planning, did not cater for children aged
3–6 years, catered exclusively for special needs children,
or were run by the NSW Department of Education and
Communities. Twenty-seven services were randomised
to intervention and 27 services to the control group.
The trial was prospectively registered with the Austra-
lian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTR
N12616000974404) and approved by the Hunter New
England (approval no: 16/02/17/4.05) and the University
of Newcastle (approval H-2016-0111) Human Research
Ethics Committees.
Economic study
A prospective, trial-based economic evaluation of the
intervention versus usual practice was conducted from
both health care sector and modified societal perspec-
tives over a 1-year time horizon, consistent with the
length of the trial (12 months). All costs were calculated
and reported in $AUD, 2017/18. The modified societal
perspective was constrained to those who would be im-
pacted financially by the intervention, health care pro-
viders and childcare services.
Usual practice (control)
Relevant international, national and state guidelines rec-
ommend that childcare services implement evidence-
based practices to improve the provision of healthy food
[32–34]. Childcare services in Australia that provide
food to children are required by national accreditation
standards to serve foods consistent with the Australian
Dietary Guidelines (ADG) [ 35]. In NSW, the Caring for
Children [ 34] resource outlines best practice dietary
guidelines for the childcare sector, which are consistent
with the ADG. Assessment and compliance officers in
NSW regulate service accreditation and use the Caring
for Children guidelines to determine if services meet ac-
creditation standards in relation to dietary guidelines for
the sector. Services in NSW are also required by law to
list all food served to children whilst in care on menus
and to make these menus publicly available. In this con-
text, usual practice for childcare services across NSW
comprises support from a health promotion officer
employed by the local health district to implement the
NSW state-wide obesity prevention programme for early
childhood, Munch and Move [ 36]. Support is typically
provided upon request from the childcare service, viaReeves et al. Implementation Science            (2021) 16:1 Page 3 of 12
telephone or face-to-face contact, with referral to sup-
porting resources. For menu planning, support may also
be in the form of a menu review and provision of feed-
back on compliance with dietary guidelines. Childcare
services that were randomly allocated to the control
group did not receive access to the directed implementa-
tion support strategies described below.
Menu planning support (intervention)
The 12-month intervention targeted menu planners and
nominated supervisors within each childcare service.
The intervention comprised access to a web-based menu
planning tool, titled feedAustralia , online resources, on-
line reminders and feedback, as well as training and sup-
port for menu planners and nominated supervisors to
use the programme. The intervention was informed by
previous research where more traditional modes of im-
plementation support, such as printed resources, were
trialled with limited success and uncertain cost-
effectiveness [ 15]. In this trial, greater effect, sustainabil-
ity and cost-effectiveness were anticipated by using a
technology platform and online resources. Details of the
components in this intervention are detailed in the ori-
ginal effectiveness study [ 31]. In brief, the intervention
comprised of the following: a web-based menu planning
programme with decision support including automated
menu planning, audit and feedback; online resources
and reminders; communication strategies and manager-
ial support; training and support to use the programme
and a portable computer tablet.
Identification, measurement and valuation of trial
outcomes
The aim of the implementation intervention was to in-
crease menu compliance with recommended dietary
guidelines for childcare services in the state (Caring for
Children resource [ 34]). These guidelines require ser-
vices to provide daily serves for each of the following
food groups: (1) vegetables and legumes/beans (two
serves); (2) fruit (one serve); (3) whole grain cereals,
foods and breads (two serves); (4) lean meat and poultry,
fish, eggs, tofu, seeds and legumes (3/4 serve); (5) milk,
yoghurt, cheese and alternatives (one serve); and (6) no
‘discretionary ’foods that are high in energy and low in
nutrients (zero serves). Compliance was defined as the
provision of the recommended number of serves for that
food group per child per day over a 1-week period.
The primary trial outcome was defined as the mean
number of food groups compliant with dietary guide-
lines: Compliance of the menu with nutrition guidelines
was assessed using best practice assessment methods,
based on calculation of the serves of each food group
provided per child, per day. The assessment was con-
ducted by a blinded dietitian who randomly selected 1week of each services ’current menu cycle for detailed
menu review. At baseline, 1 week for the current menu
cycle was randomly selected during the recruitment
phone call for those services that consented. For follow-
up, 1 week for the current menu cycle was again ran-
domly selected (approximately 12 months later). The
dietitian obtained all recipes, quantities of food served
and number of children attending each day to enable de-
tailed calculation of serves of food groups. The mean
number of compliant food groups per service (a score
out of six) was compared between intervention and con-
trol groups at 12 months follow-up.
Secondary outcomes were:
(i) Compliance with guidelines for all food groups: The
proportion of services compliant for all of the six
food groups was compared between the
intervention and control group as assessed via 1-
week menu review at baseline and 12 months
follow-up.
(ii) Individual food group compliance with dietary
guidelines: The proportion of services compliant
with dietary guidelines for each of the six individual
food groups was compared between the
intervention and control group as assessed via 1-
week menu review at baseline and 12 months
follow-up.
(iii)Mean servings of individual food groups: The mean
number of serves for each of the six food groups
provided on the menu was compared between the
intervention and control groups as assessed via 1-
week menu review at baseline and 12 months
follow-up.
Identification, measurement and valuation of resource
use
Micro-costing was used to calculate the incremental
costs of the intervention compared to usual practice.
Specific cost components, assumptions and sources of
unit costs are provided in Table 1. Resource use associ-
ated with the execution of the intervention was pro-
spectively collected using a customised cost data capture
template, designed by health economists from the
Hunter Medical Research Institute and compiled by the
health promotion officers delivering the intervention.
Categories of cost included labour, materials, joint costs
where costs are shared across multiple programmes and
miscellaneous. Resource use was tagged according to
stakeholder expense (public health, childcare service,
other).
Resource use data associated with the labour time
spent undertaking menu planning and reviewing was
collected for both intervention and usual practice ser-
vices at baseline and follow-up. These data wereReeves et al. Implementation Science            (2021) 16:1 Page 4 of 12
collected using survey instruments employed in the trial
and completed by nominated supervisors and menu
planners within each of the childcare services via tele-
phone. Baseline and follow-up surveys included ques-
tions on how much money the services usually spent on
buying food and drinks for children per month.Labour costs, including opportunity costs incurred
during the intervention uptake by childcare service staff
(cooks, educators, supervisors and directors), were cap-
tured in the form of staff time (hours) and valued using
the midpoint from relevant Australian wage rate ranges
[38]. All other resource use categories were valued usingTable 1 Micro costing assumptions and sources of unit costs

lian dollars ($AUD).
Economic analysis
The costing analysis was undertaken from both health
sector and modified societal perspectives. All analyses
were carried out using the Microsoft Excel software Of-
fice 365. The direct health sector cost to support uptake
of the web-based menu planning intervention was calcu-
lated. Costs to the childcare services in each study arm
to undertake menu planning and reviewing were also
calculated. The incremental cost of the intervention was
calculated as the net difference in the cost to undertake
menu planning and review (essential elements to plan-
ning healthier menus that meet guidelines) plus the dir-
ect cost of the intervention.
Owing to the complex set of outcomes included in
the effectiveness study, the evaluation included both
CCA and CEA. The cost-consequence analysis reports
the incremental cost of executing the intervention
alongside the primary and secondary outcomes by
way of a score-card. Cost-effectiveness analysis was
also conducted to assess the productive efficiency of
the intervention compared to usual practice. However,
the absence of an explicit willingness to pay threshold
for trial-specific cost-e ffectiveness results can make
interpretation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ra-
tio (ICER) difficult. A recent method of generating a
threshold to aid decision making was published by
Hyewon and Levine [ 39]. In this method, the cost
and outcomes associated with usual practice, com-
bined in an average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER),
are assumed to represent an implicit willingness-to-
pay threshold, having already been implemented by
the health care system or society. A relative value
index (RVI) is calculated by dividing the usual prac-
tice ACER by the ICER calculated for the new inter-
vention. The decision rule follows that if the RVI is
greater than 1 the intervention is offering additional
outcomes at an ‘acceptable ’cost and should be imple-
mented. That is, the incremental cost per unit in-
crease in compliance score with the web-based
intervention is lower than the cost per level of com-
pliance attainable with usual practice.
Cost-utility analysis, an alternate method of economic
evaluation where intervention effects are measured in
terms of impact on length of life and impact on quality
of life (utility) summarised as quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs), was not selected in this study for the reason
that the underlying trial was an implementation trial.
This trial was appropriately focussed on the measure-
ment of compliance as the implementation outcome, as
opposed to final health outcomes.Handling of bias and missing data
To avoid bias in the economic analysis [ 40], any baseline
differences in cost between the groups were adjusted by
calculating trimmed or truncated means. Similarly, it is
important not to ignore missing data. Inappropriate
handling of missing data can lead to misleading infer-
ences in economic evaluations [ 41]. While cost-
effectiveness analyses conducted alongside trials are an
important source of information for decision makers, tri-
als rarely succeed in collecting all the required informa-
tion [ 42]. Guidance for handling missing data in trial-
based cost-effectiveness analyses and for treating missing
cost data specifically recommends multiple imputation
[43–45]. In this evaluation, the treatment of missing data
was handled using a combination of methods: multiple
imputation using linear regression models and quantile
modelling.
Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
To account for uncertainty due to sampling variation,
nonparametric bootstrapping analysis with 2000 itera-
tions was used. The bootstrapped ICERs were graphic-
ally mapped on a cost-effectiveness plane and used to
derive a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) in-
dicating the probability of the intervention being cost-
effective at various levels of society ’s willingness to pay
per unit change in outcome [ 26]. The willingness to pay
threshold was informed by the ACER calculated for
usual practice [ 46].
Sensitivity analysis is used to illustrate and assess the
level of confidence that may be associated with the con-
clusion of an economic evaluation [ 47]. In this study, we
undertook several one-way sensitivity analyses. First, on
the basis that labour time in menu planning and review
was the largest driver of cost, we examined the robust-
ness of results to changes in the value of the wage rates
for childcare service staff involved in menu planning and
review. In the base case analysis, the midpoint of rate
ranges were used. In the sensitivity analysis, the upper
and lower rates were used [ 38]. In the second sensitivity
test, we conducted complete case analysis, including
only those variables with no missing data for both inter-
vention and usual practice services. Third, we adjusted
for missing data making the less conservative assump-
tion that the proportional change in childcare service
cost for the known observations would apply to the
missing data for both intervention and usual practice
services.
Results
The impact of the intervention on the specified trial out-
comes are presented in detail elsewhere [ 37]. Compared
to usual practice services, intervention services achieved
a non-significant increase in the primary outcome; theReeves et al. Implementation Science            (2021) 16:1 Page 6 of 12
mean number of food groups on the menu that were
compliant with dietary guidelines (relative effect size
0.26; 95% CI −0.61 to 1.14; p= 0.55).
Secondary outcomes were as follows: No service in ei-
ther the intervention or usual practice arms were com-
pliant with all six of the food groups at baseline, and
none of the services in either group achieved compliance
at 12 months follow-up. There were no significant differ-
ences in compliance between groups for any of the six
individual food groups at 12 months: vegetables (OR
0.37; 95% CI 0.01 –10.82; p= 0.56), fruit (OR 2.46; 95%
CI 0.41 –14.58; p= 0.32), cereals (OR 1.21; 95% CI 0.2 –
7.51; p= 0.83), meat (OR 1.7; 95% CI 0.14 –20.56; p=
0.68), dairy (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.18 –5.18; p= 0.97) and
discretionary foods (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.06 –17.29; p=
0.99). Significant increases were achieved in the mean
servings of fruit (ES 0.21; 95% CI 0.02 –0.4; p= 0.03) and
a significant reduction in the mean number of times per
week that discretionary foods were provided (ES −0.33;
95% CI −0.54 to −0.11; p= 0.003).
The mean direct cost of implementing the intervention
was calculated to be $1013 (95% UI $978, $1051) per
service including labour time and materials (from the
local health service perspective).
At baseline, intervention services were calculated to
spend a mean cost of $7094 per year on activity related
to menu planning and review, compared to an adjusted
trimmed mean of $8606 for usual practice services.
The proportion of missing 12-month follow-up data
pertaining to the self-reported costs of menu planning
and reviewing was 37%. These data were missing due to
differences between the baseline and follow-up surveys.
There was also a poor response rate (40%) by services
providing data on food and drink expenditure. These
data were requested to be able to assess if the interven-
tion had any direct financial consequences. The data that
was provided showed variation in the baseline amount
spent on food and drink per child (mean $2.56, range
$0.8 –$5.00). From the follow-up data provided, it was
not possible to determine if the intervention had re-
sulted in changes to food and drink expenditure.
Compared to usual practice services, intervention ser-
vices spent less labour time on menu planning and
reviewing both prior to the commencement of the study
and at 12 months follow-up (Table 2).The linear regression modelling included a variety of
alternate models reflecting (a) no adjustments, (b) ad-
justments using trimmed annual costs for baseline dif-
ferences and (c) imputation of missing values with
percentage difference from non-missing outcomes (but
no trimming). We also used quantile regression to
examine follow-up yearly costs allowing for a conditional
distribution. Quantile regression is a regression model in
which a specified conditional quantile of the outcome
(follow-up yearly costs) is expressed as a linear or non-
linear function of the covariates in the model. The
model was estimated at the 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and
0.90 quantiles. Wald tests were implemented to test re-
sults of heteroskedasticity for each covariate across each
quantile.
At 12 months follow-up, these costs were calculated to
be $4634 for intervention services and $7640 for usual
practice services. The mean difference in total cost
(intervention plus menu planning and review invest-
ment) was −$482 (95% UI −859, −$56). That is, the
average cost per intervention service would be $482 less
per year than for usual practice services.
Cost-consequence analysis (CCA)
The results of the cost-consequence analysis are dis-
played in Table 3. Costs associated with the intervention
and usual practice are presented as mean costs with 75%
uncertainty intervals derived from the bootstrapped
samples. As outlined above, costs were calculated using
a bottom-up approach. Consequences were included
that represent the primary and secondary study out-
comes: mean compliance score, individual food group
compliance and mean servings of individual food groups.
Mean outcomes are presented alongside the boot-
strapped generated uncertainty intervals.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
While the intervention achieved improvements in ser-
vice menus, the primary outcome of a statistically signifi-
cant increase in overall compliance of menus with
implementation of dietary guidelines was not met. For
this reason, the cost-effectiveness analysis included cal-
culation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for both
the primary outcome and for those secondary outcomes
showing significant improvements in the mean number

of servings of individual food groups (fruit and discre-
tionary food).
The calculation of a cost saving associated with the
intervention coupled with positive effect sizes for the
outcomes listed above resulted in dominant ICERs. That
is, the intervention is both less costly and more effective
than usual practice.
Using the sample data from the usual practice group,
the average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) for usual
practice was calculated to be −$2897. As described
above, this ratio constitutes an implicit benchmark
threshold and reflects the opportunity cost to implement
the intervention [ 46]. In this analysis, the RVI was calcu-
lated to be 1.11 and should be interpreted to mean that
the intervention offers greater outcomes at an ‘accept-
able ’cost and should be implemented.
Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
The joint distribution of the incremental costs and com-
pliance effects for the primary outcome measure is
shown in Fig. 1.Fifty-four percent of the bootstrap replicates were lo-
cated in quadrant I (intervention dominant with less cost
and improved compliance), and 78% of the replicates
were located across quadrants I and IV (less costly). The
result uncertainty characterised by the distribution of
the bootstrap replicates reflects variability both in out-
come and cost. Such variability is unsurprising given the
study was conducted in a diverse population of
community-based childcare services.
Three specific one-way sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted. The results are shown in Fig. 2. First, we exam-
ined the robustness of results to using alternative
(higher and lower) wage rates for childcare service staff
involved in menu planning and review. Using the pub-
lished wage ranges for these roles resulted in a 7% de-
crease/increase in the childcare service costs at baseline
and follow-up. Second, we examined the effect of per-
forming a complete case analysis where all observations
with missing data were removed. This resulted in a posi-
tive net difference in childcare service cost between
intervention and usual practice services. Third, we
adopted a less conservative approach andTable 3 Summary of costs and consequences

vation carried forward cost variables by the proportional
change observed in the observable follow-up cost vari-
ables. This resulted in the largest cost saving estimate
between intervention and usual practice services of

Discussion
There is dearth of economic evaluations of approaches
to improve and sustain the implementation of public
health interventions across a range of settings [ 24]. Spe-
cifically, there are no comparable economic evaluations
of implementation-interventions in this setting focussed
on childhood obesity. More broadly, there are published
economic evaluations of early childhood obesity preven-
tion interventions conducted in other countries [ 48–50],
and these studies are typically inconclusive in their as-
sessment of cost-effectiveness given uncertainty in mea-
sures of effect.This study is one of few economic evaluations in the
field of implementation science applied to preventive
health. For policy makers and practitioners interested in
implementation strategies to improve and sustain nutri-
tion in childhood and reduce the risk of obesity amongst
children in early childhood, this study addresses an evi-
dence gap and provides information relevant to decision
making. While there is uncertainty in the effectiveness
of the intervention in increasing the overall compliance
of menus with implementation of dietary guidelines in
childcare services, significant improvements in the mean
servings of individual healthy food groups were found.
Effect size uncertainty notwithstanding, economic evalu-
ations should still be conducted because one interven-
tion may be comparatively cost-reducing, as appears to
be the case in this study.
Further, the costing analysis conducted within the eco-
nomic evaluation is vital to inform the future costs to
sustain and scale the intervention. Funding stability,Fig. 1 Bootstrapped results on the cost-effectiveness plane for compliance score outcome. Q1: Intervention dominates —more effective and less
costly; QII: ICER —more effective with higher costs; QIII: Intervention is dominated —less effective and more costly; QIV: ICER —less effective with
less costReeves et al. Implementation Science            (2021) 16:1 Page 9 of 12
establishing a consistent financial programme base, has
been reported to be a critical factor in ensuring sustain-
ability [ 51]. In this study, the approach to identifying,
measuring and valuing resource use across the stake-
holders allows funding stability to be assessed. A clear
strength of the analysis is the prospective nature of the
economic evaluation conducted within the RCT study
design. This allowed for the resource use data to be
more accurately captured from each of the invested
stakeholders at both the baseline and follow-up points in
the study. Appropriately for trials of implementation-
interventions, the analysis was restricted to intermediate
outcomes relevant to improving guideline compliance
[52]. Overall, the results of this study suggest that it is
possible for implementation strategies to deliver eco-
nomic value even when the intervention outcomes are
modest. These results advance economic evaluation of
obesity prevention through increasing the efficiency of
existing evidence-based policy. However, a number of
limitations should also be recognised. First, while the ap-
plication of CCA to implementation strategies may be
appropriate given the range of outcomes in the trial,
CCA does not provide a clear decision metric, and with-
out an explicit acknowledgement by decision makers re-
garding their willingness to pay for increased
compliance, or value propositions based on cost-
consequence score cards, interpretation of the calculated
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is hampered.
In this analysis, additional evidence to inform and aid
decision making was provided by calculation of the rela-
tive value index presented in conjunction with the cost-consequence analysis. Second, the data collection regard-
ing childcare service labour time spent conducting menu
planning and review relied on self-reports from the ser-
vices. Despite randomisation, there was a difference be-
tween study arms in the childcare service costs at
baseline. The difference was attributed to one outlier in
the usual practice group who reported costs that were
four standard deviations from the mean and two outliers
who reported costs that were two standard deviations
from the mean. Since the data were self-reported, it is
unclear if these were true differences in time spent con-
ducting menu planning and reviews or if there were er-
rors in reporting. In the analysis, the skewness was
accounted for using a trimmed mean to mitigate the ef-
fects of the outliers.
Second, as described in the ‘Methods ’section, meas-
urement of the primary and secondary outcomes was
constrained to a single week at baseline and a single
week at follow-up, selected at random. While compli-
ance was assessed using best practice assessment
methods, it is an assumption that the observations made
during the single, short time points are representative.
Finally, the economic evaluation was not able to ad-
equately measure any financial consequences such as
changes in the acquisition cost of food and drink. Both
baseline and follow-up questions were asked of childcare
services regarding food budgets, but the data returned
was of insufficient quality to be included in the analysis.
Given the lack of economic evidence and uncertainty
in the little evidence that does exist, there is an argu-
ment for the application of value of information analysis
Fig. 2 Sensitivity analysis results —difference from base case in mean incremental cost per childcare centreReeves et al. Implementation Science            (2021) 16:1 Page 10 of 12
and value of implementation analysis in addition to
applied economic evaluation. Value of information
analysis provides a monetary value for the potential
benefits of research that can be compared with the
costs to determine if furt her research is worthwhile
[53,54]. Value of implementation analysis is a means
of identifying the potential value of investing in im-
plementation policies [ 55]. Taking the results from
this economic analysis, the combination of approaches
would inform decision making in two ways. First, it
would support the decision to invest in implementa-
tion or not and second could be used to determine if
further implementation trials are warranted [ 53].
Conclusion
Robust economic evaluation evidence should form basis
of decision making in health. In this study, the trial-
based economic evaluation showed that, compared to
usual practice, web-based programmes may offer an effi-
cient and sustainable alternative for childcare services to
improve the provision of healthy foods to children in
their care.
