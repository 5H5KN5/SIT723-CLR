ABSTRACT
We argue that the active ingredients of behaviour change interventions,often called behaviour change methods (BCMs) or techniques (BCTs),can usefully be placed on a dimension of psychological aggregation. We
introduce evolutionary learning processes (ELPs) as fundamental
building blocks that are on a lower level of psychological aggregation
than BCMs/BCTs. A better understanding of ELPs is useful to select the
appropriate BCMs/BCTs to target determinants of behaviour, or viceversa, to identify potential determinants targeted by a given BCM/BCT,
and to optimally translate them into practical applications. Using these
insights during intervention development may increase the likelihood of
developing effective interventions –both in terms of behaviour change
as well as maintenance of behaviour change.ARTICLE HISTORY

Within health psychology, there are ongoing efforts to develop taxonomies of the active ingredients
of behaviour change interventions (Kok et al., 2016 ; Michie et al., 2013 ). Some refer to these active
ingredients as behaviour change techniques (BCTs), which are defined as ‘an observable, replicable,
and irreducible component of an intervention designed to alter or redirect causal processes that
regulate behaviour ’(Michie et al., 2013 , p. 82). The use of the adjective ‘irreducible ’is in line with
the initial idea behind the BCT taxonomy to address ‘the need for a common vocabulary in terms
of which content components of behaviour change interventions can be defined and described ’
(Abraham & Michie, 2008 , p. 380). In other words, it is a coding taxonomy, which implies that the dis-
tinction between BCTs has to be very clearly defined: the goal is to achieve categories that are
mutually exclusive and ideally exhaustive. Others, however, refer to these tools as theory-based
methods, or behaviour change methods (BCMs), which are defined as ‘general techniques or pro-
cesses that have been shown to be able to change one or more determinants of behaviour ’(Kok
et al., 2016 , p. 299). This is suitable for a development taxonomy with the goal ‘to provide a
toolbox that most efficiently enables planners to select the method that fits their circumstances ’
(Kok et al., 2016 , p. 304). These theory-based methods are drawn from different theories and may
overlap. These differences in their nature render BCMs most appropriate for the development of
behaviour change interventions and BCTs for the coding of behaviour change interventions.
However, the concept of a ‘BCM ’and a ‘BCT’is similar, and this article deals with both. As umbrella
term, we will use Behaviour Change Principle or Behaviour Change Principle set (both abbreviated toBCP). A BCP is any principle or any set of principles that can be applied to change behaviour, or more

accurately, determinants of behaviour, with the assumption that it will be effective. Stated more
strongly, we would argue that any intervention that successfully changes one or more determinantsof behaviour must therefore involve one or more BCPs. It is important to note this, because this
touches upon a core difference between BCMs and BCTs. The idea is that BCMs are effective if the
parameters for use are properly respected when translating BCMs to practical applications (Koket al., 2016 ). In this vocabulary, there is a clear distinction between the active ingredients (the
BCM) and the operationalisation of these principles (the practical application; see Figure 6 ). The
description of BCTs, on the other hand, ‘is precise enough to achieve reliability of recognition but
the definition does not require that BCTs be effective ’(Michie, Johnson, & Johnston, 2015 , p. 25),
which is one of the reasons BCTs are not suited for intervention development. BCTs, therefore, are
somewhat of an amalgam of BCMs (hypothetically effective methods of behaviour change) and prac-tical applications (operational definitions) that may include inactive ingredients. Those BCTs that are
ineffective therefore involve no BCPs; and of those that are effective, their description may contain
elements that are not required to adequately leverage the relevant BCPs.
A similarity between BCTs and BCMs is that they both explicitly provide for clustering of BCPs into
‘higher level ’BCPs (Kok, Gottlieb, Panne, & Smerecnik, 2012 ; Michie et al., 2013 ). In the current con-
tribution, we will argue that this ‘clusterability ’belies a more fundamental property of BCPs: a BCP can
be placed on a continuum of psychological aggregation (Peters & Crutzen, 2017b ). Furthermore, we
will argue that on this continuum, neither BCTs nor BCMs come close to the lowest level (i.e., are irre-
ducible components). Instead, we will introduce what we perceive to be the foundation of behaviourchange: evolutionary learning processes (ELPs). We will explain why it is important to understand
how these ELPs operate when applying BCPs at higher levels of psychological aggregation (such
as BCTs and BCMs). More generally, we will show how a perspective on BCPs analogous to pragmaticnihilism is useful when thinking about behaviour change (Peters & Crutzen, 2017b ).
We will illustrate applying this perspective to two steps of intervention development, reflected by
two subfields of (health) psychology: behaviour explanation and behaviour change (Glanz & Bishop,2010 ). First, we will illustrate that a better understanding of these ELPs and their manifestation in
higher level BCPs is useful to select the appropriate BCPs during intervention development. In
research, this understanding can help to link BCPs to determinants (Kok et al., 2016 ) or mechanisms
of action (Michie, Johnston, Rothman, Kelly, & De Bruin, 2016 ). Second, we argue that BCPs work
through psychological processes that can be derived from ELPs. So, during intervention develop-
ment, when translating BCPs to practical applications, these psychological processes need to betaken into account. Selecting BCPs that are suitable to target relevant determinants of a certain
behaviour and optimally translate them into practical applications is essential to increase the likeli-
hood of developing effective interventions targeted at that behaviour (Abraham, 2015 ; Bartholomew
Eldredge et al., 2016 ). In research, awareness of lower-level BCPs enables researchers to craft matched
stimuli for control conditions to ensure comparability (Michie, Prestwich, & De Bruin, 2010 ).
Levels of psychological aggregation
Both BCTs and BCMs are presented as taxonomies that are particular systems of classification (Kok
et al., 2016 ; Michie et al., 2013 ). The BCT taxonomy comprises an extensive hierarchical classification.
For example, the BCTs ‘Demonstration of the behaviour ’and ‘Social comparison ’are both grouped
under the higher level cluster labelled ‘Comparison of behaviour ’(Michie et al., 2013 ).‘Comparison
of behaviour ’has a higher level of psychological aggregation than the individual BCTs that are
grouped in this cluster ( Figure 1 ). The BCPs ‘Social Comparison ’and ‘Demonstration of the behaviour ’
each engage specific sets of psychological processes that may result in changes in psychologicaldeterminants. Using BCP ‘Comparison of behaviour ’involves the psychological processes engaged
by both ‘sub-BCPs ’.
Also within the taxonomy of BCMs there are different levels of psychological aggregation, as
acknowledged by Kok et al.: ‘methods may vary in their level of specificity, and may even encompass44 R. CRUTZEN AND G.-J. Y. PETERS
each other ’(Kok et al., 2016 , p. 304). For example, ‘Participatory problem solving ’(at a higher level of
psychological aggregation) is often comprised of ‘Goal setting ’and ‘Feedback ’(each at a lower level
of psychological aggregation) (Kok et al., 2012 )(Figure 2 ).
So, level of psychological aggregation is an important but implicit dimension in both taxo-
nomies. This mirrors the importance of level of psychological aggregation in health psychologytheory regarding determinants of behaviour (Peters & Crutzen, 2017b ). In the Reasoned Action
Approach, for example, intention has the highest level of psychological aggregation, followed
by attitude, experiential attitude, and ultimately ending with behavioural beliefs at the lowestlevel of psychological aggregation (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010 ). In many theories of behaviour expla-
nation, the smallest units that are distinguished are on the same level of psychological aggregation
as these ‘beliefs ’in attitude research (Peters & Crutzen, 2017b ). Such lower levels of psychological
aggregation are crucial, because those very specific aspects of human psychology are what is used
in operationalisations and intervention messages (Crutzen & Peters, 2017 ). However, BCPs as
defined in the BCM and BCT traditions are defined at a much higher level of psychological aggre-
gation, a level more akin to that of determinants such as attitude and self-efficacy. In fact, in the
intervention mapping (IM) framework for intervention development and description, the intersec-tion of behaviour explanation theory with behaviour change theory explicitly occurs at the deter-
minant level. In IM, the intervention developer first identifies the beliefs that predict the target
behaviour, and then identifies the determinants these beliefs are a part of to search for BCPs.By analogy, this raises the question whether BCPs are in fact at the lowest level of psychological
aggregation, as has been argued for BCTs (Michie et al., 2013 ). In other words, do higher level clus-
ters (Michie et al., 2013 ) consist of irreducible components (e.g., BCTs), or is it useful to distinguish
lower levels of psychological aggregation, on which these BCPs in turn rely? We argue the latter:
BCPs rely on evolutionary learning principles (ELPs).

A reinforcement learning perspective on behaviour
Before explaining how BCPs rely on ELPs, we first take a step back and explain how behaviour results
from brain activity. In short, all overt behaviour results from activation patterns of firing neurons in the
motor cortex, and activation patterns in the motor cortex are the result of activation patterns else-where in the brain (Pinel, 2011 ). When people learn, this also results in changes in activation patterns
of firing neurons. This idea is based on the role of enzymatic neurons in the selection circuits model
(Kampfner & Conrad, 1983 ). According to this model, the firing properties of neurons are controlled
by postulated enzymes called excitases. Learning is mediated by changes in the excitase composition
of enzymatic neurons. These changes are guided by processes analogous to evolution by variation
and selection of networks:
Different types of excitases may be added to or deleted from enzymatic neurons in these networks by various
types of random processes (i.e., variation processes). The behaviour of the organism can be controlled by anyone or any combination of these networks. The functional value of each of the networks is evaluated on the
basis of the organism ’s performance. The excitase contents of the best performing networks are retained and
transferred to the less fit networks (i.e., selection processes). (Kampfner & Conrad, 1983 , pp. 935 –936; text
between parentheses added by us)
This is in line with a reinforcement learning perspective on behaviour: people acquire complex beha-
viours by learning to obtain (real or conjectured) rewards and to avoid punishments (Vlaev & Dolan,
2015 ). Subsequently, the brain can decide which action to take based on ‘computation ’of value (i.e.,
expected rewards) (Rangel, Camerer, & Montague, 2008 ). In a colloquial way, the use of words such as
‘decide ’and ‘value ’might give the impression that this only concerns goal-directed behaviour based
on re ﬂection. The same applies, however, to habitual behaviours (Gardner, 2015 ). Moreover, the
values might be based on various rewards such as comfort, control, status, and belonging (Vlaev &Dolan, 2015 ). Thus, despite choice of words, no rationality, logic, or re ﬂection is implied: these theor-
etical foundations are not bounded to speci ﬁc aspects of human behaviour or psychology.
The evolution of ELPs
The fact that various rewards are valuable to an organism and that the brain evolved to obtain those
rewards says nothing about the learning process as such (i.e., how the brain changes to optimise future
reward obtainment). However, it is possible to identify new, distinct learning processes that evolved
over time, such as classical conditioning (see Table 1 for an overview). The evolution of these learning
processes was needed to solve particular problems in the niches in which organisms evolved (e.g., howto find food? Where to sleep safely?). There are enough regularities in these niches for distinct learning
processes to evolve on top of existing learning processes (Aunger & Curtis, 2015 ). For example, despite
the (self-perceived) sophistication of our learning, humans still use simple cue-response reflexes thatwere already present in invertebrates. Evolution did not do away with reflexes when deliberative cog-
nitions evolved. Each of these learning processes enabled specific behavioural novelties that facilitated
organisms ’adaptation to a changing environment over time. Learning processes refer to different
types of learning, different types of memory, as well as abilities to mentally represent phenomena in
the external world. Because these learning processes have an evolutionary function, we label them
as evolutionary learning processes (ELPs). Reflective learning is the only ELP that is unique tohumans; all the other ELPs were already exhibited in animal behaviour long ago. Table 1 provides
an overview of ELPs and behavioural novelties in chronological order (Aunger & Curtis, 2015 ), as
well as examples of how ELPs are still relevant in enabling human behaviour in everyday life.
BCPs rely on ELPs
The examples of ELPs that are provided in Table 1 refer to learning in everyday life. There are differ-
ences between people in the way and the extent to which they learn to behave, of course. In other46 R. CRUTZEN AND G.-J. Y. PETERS
words, some people are better in adapting than others. However, learning in itself is undeniably
needed to behave appropriately in the environment one lives in. This is also relevant for health,which can be defined as ‘the ability to adapt and to self-manage in the face of social, physical,
and emotional challenges ’(Huber et al., 2011 , p. 1, our emphasis). Interventions in the field of
health psychology therefore often stimulate people to adapt their behaviour (i.e., they are oftenaimed at behaviour change). In fact, these interventions should be seen as stimulating an ‘intensified

form ’of learning, comparable to deliberate stimulations of learning that have been used by humans
long before they were defined and studied, and have enabled natural adaption even before that byhumans and other organisms. For example, Pavlov ’s initial observations of classical conditioning were
serendipitous; a particular pattern of footsteps happened to be associated with food being provided
to the dogs in the lab. Later on, Pavlov started manipulating patterns in order to get more insight intothis type of learning (Todes, 2014 ). Manipulations of these patterns could be seen as an early type of
behaviour change intervention relying on ELPs. In a more general sense, BCPs that have an impact on
(determinants of) behaviour rely on ELPs. To put it strongly, (people ’s) capability to change consists of
ELPs, and these operate through psychological processes (as explained later on). The behaviour of the
dogs in Pavlov ’lab would not have changed if no learning had taken place. This applies to BCPs
aimed directly at the individual (e.g., guided practice, where individuals practice a behaviour withsupervision) as well as to changes in response to the environment (e.g., when certain cues are
removed; Moore & Depue, 2016 ).
For example, habituation/sensitisation is an ELP that uses the fact that environmental input over
time might lead to different neurobiological reactions: depending on the parameters, those reactions
can intensify (sensitisation) or fade away (habituation). This is also reflected in people ’s behaviour. For
example, when eating the same food during a meal, people decrease their consumption over time.Habituation plays an important role in this phenomenon (besides satiety), because food variety slows
down the habituation process and is considered to contribute to the development and maintenance
of obesity (Raynor & Epstein, 2001 ).Table 2 provides an overview of how BCPs (Bartholomew
Eldredge et al., 2016 ) rely on different ELPs. This is not meant to be a comprehensive overview of
all existing BCPs, but merely serves to demonstrate how BCPs rely on ELPs.
ELPs are at a lower level of psychological aggregation, followed by BCMs and BCTs at higher levels.
InTable 2 , we have provided two examples of BCPs for each ELP in order to illustrate that different
BCPs can rely on the same ELP. The overlap between BCPs (e.g., providing cues and stimulus control;
Figure 3 ) might become apparent when they are translated to practical applications. It is also possible
that a BCP relies on more than one ELP ( Figure 4 ). For example, planning coping responses requires
identification of high-risk situations and practice of coping responses (Bartholomew Eldredge et al.,
2016 ). This BCP relies on reflective learning, because people need to be able to derive high-risk situ-
ations from their past behaviour. However, it also relies on procedural memory, because practising of
coping responses might require people to learn complex behavioural sequences. Finally, at an even
higher level of psychological aggregation, there are overarching BCPs that combine multiple lower-level BCPs ( Figure 5 ). For example, motivational interviewing often includes goal setting and planning
coping responses (Hardcastle, Fortier, Blake, & Hagger, 2017 ).
Using ELPs when selecting BCPs
The reliance of BCPs on ELPs is not only interesting from a theoretical point of view, but also relevant
for intervention development. During intervention development, BCPs are linked to the determinants
of behaviour that need to be targeted in an intervention. Some BCPs are more appropriate for certain
determinants (Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016 ). We argue that this is because these BCPs rely on
different ELPs that are more relevant for certain determinants, for example, because those determi-
nants are defined as aspects of memory or psychological processes of a type that the relevant ELPs
act on. In other words, a better understanding of ELPs is useful to select the appropriate BCPs duringintervention development. Although this required match between determinants and BCPs is already
acknowledged in several approaches to plan behaviour change interventions (Aunger & Curtis, 2016 ;
Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016 ), the concept of ELPs provides a systematic way of thinking about
this match. In short: we submit that ELPs are the missing link to explain why a given BCP is more likely
to change some determinants (or ‘mechanisms of action ’) than others. However, it is important to
keep in mind that although ELPs are useful categories of learning processes, learning processesare not modular any more than psychological variables are (Peters & Crutzen, 2017a ). Construing48 R. CRUTZEN AND G.-J. Y. PETERS

psychological variables and processes as modular entities is intuitive, and moreover, required to
enable systematic study and communicating one ’s findings –but this convenience afforded by mod-
ularity does not also afford it truthfulness.
In the debate about pragmatic nihilism (De Vries, 2017 ; Fried, 2017 ; Gruijters, 2017 ; Peters &
Crutzen, 2017a ,2017b ; Trafimow, 2017 ), it has been argued that psychological constructs need not
exist as such to have value for behaviour change. This same pragmatic position can be taken regard-
ing BCPs. Psychology did not evolve to be conveniently described using categories, and that applies
both to variables and processes. Therefore, it is unlikely that BCPs can be pinpointed as such: instead,they are useful descriptions of ways to leverage aspects of human psychology in order to achieve
behaviour change. It follows from this position that there is nothing special about the level at
which BCTs and BCMs are currently described, about the level at which ELPs are described, orabout the level at which clustered BCTs and BCMs are described. These levels conveniently lend
themselves for description, coding, research, and intervention development, but that does not
mean that these levels therefore have a central role in human psychology. In other words, ‘[w]hat
is convenient when thinking about or measuring aspects of human psychology does not, by virtue
of the fact that it comes natural to the scientists doing the science, have to be what is true ’
(Peters & Crutzen, 2017a , p. 142).
Figure 4. Example of a BCP relying on more than one ELP.
Figure 5. Example of overarching BCP that combines multiple lower-level BCPs.50 R. CRUTZEN AND G.-J. Y. PETERS
This also means that other levels can usefully be distinguished in between the level of ELPs and
the level of BCPs. For example, Figure 5 shows that the BCP planning coping responses uses two ELPs:
reflective learning and procedural memory. Intermediate levels that can be distinguished are, for
example, identify high-risk situations, identify most effective coping responses, and decide to
monitor for high-risk situations and, if one arises, engage in the corresponding coping response.Each of these BCPs in itself can be expected to achieve some changes in relevant psychological deter-
minants (which may then translate to behaviour change). However, when used collectively they
satisfy a number of practical conditions (i.e., high-risk situations are not only identified, but solutionsare prepared as well) that together represent a particularly high likelihood that the changes in deter-
minants result in behaviour change. For this reason, planning coping responses is a BCP at a more
useful level than the three BCPs distinguished at this lower level. Although the levels at whichBCPs are described do not necessarily reflect crucial levels at which human psychology functions,
these levels do provide information about where useful synergies exist that can effectively be
exploited in behaviour change.
This is reflected by current descriptions of BCPs in the literature (see e.g., Kok et al., 2016 ; Michie
et al., 2013 ) that already clearly show combinations of multiple lower-level BCPs. The developers of
those taxonomies will generally have aimed to formulate their BCP descriptions such that theycontain all those steps that are necessary for the BCP to be optimally effective. For example, when
an intervention developer misapplies coping planning and instead only includes the identification
of high-risk situations, the intervention will still change aspects of participants ’psychology, and
this will still translate to behaviour change for some participants. However, if the BCP description
is followed completely, the effectiveness can be expected to be higher. For some BCPs, certain
lower-level BCPs are crucial. For example, in the case of modelling, if the participants do not identifywith the role model, no behaviour change can be expected, as the ELP vicarious conditioning requires
an appropriate model to take place. Such conditions for effectiveness are explicitly contained in BCM
descriptions as parameters for use (Kok et al., 2016 ).
Our argument, therefore, extends beyond the importance of understanding ELPs: to optimally
apply BCPs in behaviour change interventions, and to study BCPs in a methodologically correct
manner, requires understanding the involved psychology (see next section for more details). ELPsare a useful endpoint of sorts, in that they are clearly identifiable in many organisms yet maintain
their functionality in humans, and as such, are usefully seen as the most specific level. However, evol-
ution and human psychology do not care for convenient levels or categories, and lower-level pro-cesses than ELPs are involved in behaviour change. These lower-level processes combine in
different configurations that exhibit some consistency in function that are usefully captured by
ELPs (e.g., reflective learning), and permutations of (aspects of) ELPs combine in BCPs at a higherlevel (e.g., identify high-risk situations) and eventually in BCMs, BCTs (e.g., planning coping
responses), and clusters of BCMs and BCTs (e.g., motivational interviewing). Thus, familiarity with
the literature concerning a BCP (i.e., the relevant fundamental psychological studies, e.g., from cog-nitive psychology), and therefore being aware of lower-level BCPs that are potentially useful to dis-
tinguish and understand, can considerably facilitate behaviour change research and intervention
development. We will illustrate how knowledge of ELPs underlying a number of BCPs can be ben-eficial when selecting the appropriate BCPs during intervention development.
The older ELPs (e.g., classical conditioning, operant conditioning) are most appropriate to change
habitual, automatic, and impulsive behaviours , or determinants defined as aspects of human psychol-
ogy related to habituation and sensitisation. It is important to note that although people might not be
aware of the learning processes taking place at the brain level, this does not mean that they cannot
actively contribute to learning. For example, when using stimulus control to encourage people toremove cues for unhealthy habits, it is essential that they have insight in the cues leading to auto-
matic responses (Papies, 2016 ). This insight can then be used in an intervention recommending
people to remove their ashtrays or other cues that might lead to craving for a cigarette.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 51
BCPs that rely on affective learning (e.g., fear arousal, dramatic relief) are most appropriate to
change awareness and risk perception . Affective learning evolved after the older ELPs and it was
the first step in evolution of organisms becoming aware of their own behaviour. Nowadays, these
BCPs can still lead to increased attention (Kessels, Ruiter, & Jansma, 2010 ), but this is useless if
people are not confident they can successfully perform an alternative behaviour to eliminate thethreat. Therefore, it is not surprising that subsequently ELPs such as procedural memory and cogni-
tive maps evolved, as these are most appropriate to improve skills and knowledge , respectively. Next,
vicarious conditioning resulted in people learning from each other, which is one of the sources of self-
efficacy (Bandura, 1997 ).
Later in evolution, abstract concept learning evolved. Being able to categorise is beneficial in the
sense that people need less cognitive resources in order to know how to behave in a certain situationthat is similar to situations they have encountered before. However, it can also result in stereotyping
that affects people ’s judgement and behaviour (Kunda & Spencer, 2003 ). Hence, BCPs aimed at redu-
cing stigma often rely on abstract concept learning (Bos, Schaalma, & Pryor, 2008 ).
Finally, reflective learning evolved. This is highly relevant for long-term planning and to achieve
larger goals in life (e.g., McEwan et al., 2016 ). On the one hand, this is just one of the many ELPs
that can be used in behaviour change interventions. On the other hand, it is an ELP that uses aunique capability of humans: to reflect on their own behaviour and to behave in a certain way to
achieve long-term goals. Table 3 provides an overview of the ELPs and their potential intervention
targets. It is important to keep in mind that BCPs can rely on more than one ELP ( Figure 4 ) and
that there are overarching BCPs that combine multiple lower-level BCPs and ELPs ( Figure 5 ).
Using ELPs when applying BCPs
The link between ELPs and BCPs might come across as a simple mix-and-match exercise that can be
used when selecting the appropriate BCPs during intervention development. For example, as
explained above, BCPs relying on operant conditioning can be used when targeting a habitual behav-
iour. However, applying these insights during intervention development requires a thorough under-
standing of ELPs. For example, when using BCPs that rely on operant conditioning, one should be
familiar with differences between performance of fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, and vari-
able-interval schedules (Ferster & Skinner, 1957 ) as well as the existence of the partial-reinforcement
effect (Humphreys, 1939 ). The same goes, for example, for ELPs relying on different types of memory.
In fact, memory research focusing on different levels of processing is a branch of research on its own
(Craik & Lockhart, 1972 ). This implies that development of intervention components necessitates in-
depth insight into fundamental research from fields such as experimental psychology and cognitive
psychology (Johnston, 2016 ).
Applying BCPs is not a matter of selecting and combining them into an attractive intervention.
BCPs are not psychological tricks that can be reliably employed to achieve behaviour change, and
in fact do not even have an ‘effectiveness ’in and of themselves (Peters, De Bruin, & Crutzen,
2015 ). Instead, learning processes are exploited that evolved for altogether different purposes.
Because behaviour change interventions must successfully engage those learning processes, success-
fully mimicking the way in which people learn in everyday life and the situations for which those

learning processes evolved is crucial, as these are necessary conditions for effectiveness. This mimick-
ing requires an in-depth understanding of the psychological processes relevant to the chosen BCPs.The method specifications in the IM taxonomy aim to capture these crucial conditions for effective-
ness, referred to as parameters for use (Kok et al., 2016 ). These parameters for use capture those
aspects that are crucial to successfully engage the psychological processes that constitute the rel-evant method of behaviour change. For example, in the case of modelling, one of the parameters
for use decrees that the model must be positively reinforced. This makes sense when considering
the background of vicarious learning. Selectively mimicking behaviour with positive consequencesfor those executing it is a superior strategy (from an evolutionary point of view) to mimicking all
observed behaviour (Peters & Kok, 2016 ).
When translating BCPs into practical applications to be used in an intervention, it is crucial to take
these parameters for use into account ( Figure 6 ). This is necessary to make sure that the BCPs are
optimally translated, meaning that the appropriate psychological processes are targeted. These
psychological processes can be derived from ELPs. For example, providing stereotype-inconsistentinformation (i.e., positive examples from the stigmatised group) as a way to reduce stigma relies
on abstract concept learning ( Table 2 ). This abstract concept learning is only effective when there
are many different examples, and these examples are not too discrepant from the original stereotype(Bos et al., 2008 ; Kok et al., 2016 ). If the BCP of providing stereotype-inconsistent information is oper-
ationalised in such a way that only few different examples are used, people might think that just one
exception is presented. If the examples are too discrepant, people might deem the information to beirrelevant regarding their views on the stigmatised group. At the ELP level of psychological aggrega-
tion, this is explained by the dynamics of declarative memory. Presentation of few exemplars that
share many characteristics with existing schemata results in assimilation into those existing sche-mata, whereas presenting sufficient and sufficiently deviant exemplars results in accommodation
of the schemata (Axelrod, 1973 ). Hence, using enough and the right examples is essential to
engage the appropriate psychological processes.
Implications of the BCP aggregation continuum and ELPs as foundation
Viewing BCPs as being located on a continuum, with BCPs consisting of lower-level BCPs and ELPs
being the smallest (currently identified) building blocks, has a number of implications.
First, construing BCPs as configurations of lower-level BCPs in varying intensities explains overlap
between BCPs. If multiple BCPs utilise the same ELPs some degree of overlap is inevitable. This means
that in coding taxonomies, obtaining mutual exclusivity of BCPs at higher levels than the lowest level
necessarily requires artificially imposing a discontinuity that does in fact not exist in the BCPs them-selves ( Figure 6 ). Acknowledging ELPs in such taxonomies is useful in this respect, but as ELPs may
turn out not to be the lowest level, some blurring of the lines may remain inevitable even then.
Second, if to be effective BCPs need to successfully engage lower-level BCPs (with ELPs represent-
ing the lowest level currently distinguished), this means that listing methods or techniques of behav-
iour change that are used in an intervention is insufficient to replicate intervention efforts. Such lists
are not informative about the way in which the methods or techniques are operationalised. Instead, itis warranted to also describe the practical applications that are used in an intervention (e.g., by pro-
viding an intervention manual) and how the parameters for use are taken into account during inter-
vention development (Crutzen, Peters, & Abraham, 2012 ; Peters, Abraham, & Crutzen, 2012 ).
Third, if BCPs are located on a continuum, the question ‘how do BCPs (or BCTs or BCMs) rank in
terms of effectiveness ’is not a sensible question (e.g., Gardner, Smith, Lorencatto, Hamer, &
Biddle, 2016 ;O’Brien et al., 2015 ). This effectiveness is a function of BCP, correct application of the
BCP in terms of correct exploitation of the lower-level BCPs (and ultimately ELPs), match between
BCP and determinant(s) targeted by that BCP, and the relevance of the targeted determinant(s)
(Crutzen & Peters, 2017 ; Peters et al., 2015 ). Accepting that BCPs (or BCTs or BCMs) are not simply
tricks that can be employed to directly influence behaviour (i.e., without affecting psychologicalHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 53
Figure 6. Combination of previous examples of BCPs, stressing the importance of adequate operationalisations.54 R. CRUTZEN AND G.-J. Y. PETERS
processes) also means accepting that the conditions for their effectiveness are not so simple as to
render questions such as ‘how effective is this BCP ’meaningful.
Final thoughts
Aunger and Curtis ( 2015 ) elaborate on the regularities in the niches in which organisms evolved
resulting in distinct learning processes. Although their description of development of organisms
over time is very convincing, this does not mean that the ELPs presented in Table 1 are necessarily
comprehensive. We do think, however, that in order for a BCP to be effective, it has to rely on one ormore ELPs. If future research sheds light on effective BCPs that do not rely on the ELPs presented
here, then clearly, the ELPs presented in Table 1 are not comprehensive, and the list should be
extended. To the best of our knowledge, however, these ELPs are comprehensive regarding theBCPs used in current interventions.
Although interventions are often aimed at behaviour change itself, this is only a first step for inter-
ventions to have a public health impact (Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999 ). Stimulating people to change
their behaviour does not mean that they maintain this behaviour change over time (Kwasnicka, Dom-
browski, White, & Sniehotta, 2016 ). An explanation for this phenomenon based on the reinforcement
learning perspective used in this article is that most interventions might not be intensive enough toactually ‘rewire our brain ’. This intensity does not only refer to intensity of one session, but especially
to intensity in the long run. From the presently introduced perspective, where ELPs are postulated as
foundations in a continuum of BCPs, this can be explained at the ELP level of this continuum. Forexample, at the brain level, there is a trade-off between the speed of learning and its accuracy. If
the rate of addition of excitases is increased beyond a critical point, the gradualism required for evol-
utionary learning is lost since the possibility for small changes in the excitase composition of neuronsis lost (Kampfner & Conrad, 1983 ). This is also reflected at the behavioural level. Prevention of obesity,
for example, is thought to be most successful when focusing on small changes in dietary intake and
physical activity, since small changes are easier to maintain in the long run (Hill, 2009 ).
Conclusion
We have introduced a perspective where all BCTs and BCMs (more generally: BCPs) are placed on a
continuum of aggregation. The ELPs form the foundation of this continuum. We discussed how this
can be useful to select the appropriate BCPs to target determinants of behaviour and to identify and
satisfy the conditions for their effectiveness. Using these insights during intervention development, incombination with a thorough understanding of ELPs, has the potential to increase the likelihood of
developing effective interventions –both in terms of behaviour change as well as maintenance of
behaviour change.
