ABSTRACT
Objectives: The bene ﬁts of increased physical activity for stroke
survivors include improved function and mental health and
wellbeing. However, less than 30% achieve recommendedphysical activity levels, and high levels of sedentary behaviour are
reported. We developed a multifaceted behavioural intervention
(and accompanying implementation plan) targeting physical
activity and sedentary behaviour of stroke survivors.
Design: Intervention Mapping facilitated intervention development.
Step 1 involved a systematic review, focus group discussions and a
review of care pathways. Step 2 identi ﬁed social cognitive
determinants of behavioural change and behavioural outcomes.Step 3 linked determinants of behavioural outcomes with speci ﬁc
behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to target behaviours of
interest. Step 4 involved intervention development informed by
steps 1 –3. Subsequently, an implementation plan was developed
(Step 5) followed by an evaluation plan (Step 6).Setting: Community and secondary care settings, North East
England.
Participants: Stroke survivors and healthcare professionals (HCPs)
working in stroke services.
Results: Systematic review ﬁndings informed selection of nine
‘promising ’BCTs (e.g. problem-solving). Focus groups with stroke
survivors ( n=1 8 ) a n d H C P s ( n=2 4 ) i d e n t i ﬁed the need for an
intervention delivered throughout the rehabilitation pathway,
tailored to individual needs with training for HCPs delivering the
intervention. Intervention delivery was considered feasible withinlocal stroke services. The target behaviours for the interventionARTICLE HISTORY

HCPs and 21 stroke survivors/relatives identi ﬁed issues with self-
monitoring tools and the need for a physical activity repositoryof local services ’and training for HCPs with feedback on

mapping resulted in a multi-faceted evidence- and theory-informedintervention (Physical Activity Routines After Stroke –PARAS) for
delivery by community stroke rehabilitation teams.
Introduction
Low levels of physical activity (Fini et al., 2017) and high levels of time spent sedentary
(Morton et al., 2021) are common after stroke. Both are associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, (Bailey et al., 2019) reduced life expectancy
(Lee et al., 2012) and impact negatively upon mental health and well-being. Speci ﬁc
stroke-related impairments have been cited as speci ﬁc barriers to engagement in physical
activity and reducing sedentary behaviour, (Nicholson et al., 2012) and may be why exer-
cise preferences appear di ﬀerent in the stroke versus other populations (Banks et al.,
2012). This highlights the need for bespoke interventions speci ﬁcally designed for indi-
viduals with stroke.
A wealth of research demonstrates the short-term bene ﬁts of structured exercise
interventions (commonly delivered in a group format) on cardiovascular risk
factors (Moore et al., 2014) and function after stroke; (Saunders et al., 2020)
however, longer-term bene ﬁts are under-researched. Furthermore, structured exercise
interventions for stroke survivors often have little or no emphasis on everyday habit-
ual levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour (Saunders et al., 2020) and often
do not focus on developing stroke survivors ’self-management skills, which prevents
them from making sustained changes in behaviour beyond the intervention period
(Morris et al., 2015).
The small number of randomised controlled trials ( n= 9) conducted that target long-
term free-living physical activity after stroke show promise (Moore et al., 2018).
However, limitations in methodological quality and intervention design prevent any
robust conclusions in this ﬁeld (Moore et al., 2018). Speci ﬁcally, they lack adequate
descriptions of intervention content (Ho ﬀmann et al., 2014) and ﬁdelity assessment,
(Bellg et al., 2004) which restricts replicability and prevents successful implementation.
There is also a dearth of interventions targeting reductions in sedentary behaviour along-side increasing physical activity of stroke survivors.
Furthermore, few interventions targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviour
post-stroke have been developed with reference to theory, systematically developed orrobustly evaluated (Moore et al., 2018). The application of health behaviour change
theory is critically important to gain a thorough understanding of the antecedents of
the behaviours of interest, to develop targeted and e ﬀective interventions (Nicholson
et al., 2012,2014). Theory based interventions have been shown to signi ﬁcantly impact
upon physical activity behaviour (Gourlan et al., 2016). Intervention Mapping is a440 S. A. MOORE ET AL.
practical framework for systematic, evidence and theory-based planning for behavioural
change (Kok, 2014) and has been particularly e ﬀective in the context of healthcare, (Fer-
nandez et al., 2019; Hurley et al., 2016) including informing the development of interven-
tions targeting physical activity behaviour (Brug, Oenema, & Ferreira, 2005).
Using Intervention Mapping, our aim was to systematically develop an evidence-and
theory-informed behavioural intervention targeting long-term, free-living physical
activity and sedentary behaviour for integration into the stroke rehabilitation carepathway.
Methods
Overview of development process
Our intervention was developed with reference to the Medical Research Council (MRC)
Framework for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions. Complex
interventions are those that contain several interacting components. The current inter-
vention was de ﬁned as complex given the complex needs of the target population (i.e.
stroke impairment) and the challenges associated with and in ﬂuencing behavioural
change. These complexities present unique problems for evaluation (Craig et al.,
2013). Alongside the MRC framework, we utilised Intervention Mapping to inform inter-
vention content, delivery, implementation and evaluation (Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok,Gottlieb, & Fernandez, 2011). Details of how the six steps of the implementation
mapping intervention development approach described by (Bartholomew et al., 2011)
were applied are described in the methods and summarised in Figure 1 .

Methods and results
Ethics statement
Ethical approval for the development workshops with stroke survivors and healthcare
professionals was givenon the 24/10/2016 from the Faculty of Medical Science ethics
committee at Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K. (reference number
01211/2016). Fully informed written consent was gained from all participants whotook part in the study.
Step 1: needs assessment
To enable the development and implementation of a tailored intervention to e ﬀectively
target physical activity and sedentary behaviour after stroke, we conducted a needsassessment. To do this, we ﬁrst conducted a systematic review of the literature (Moore
et al., 2018) and secondly consulted with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and stroke sur-
vivors and identi ﬁed local community stroke care pathways (where they existed) to deter-
mine how a new intervention could integrate with and/or complement current pathways.
Systematic review
A previously published systematic review of randomised controlled trials was undertaken
to explore the characteristics and promise of existing intervention components targeting
free-living physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour after stroke (Moore et al., 2018).
Keyﬁndings of systematic review
All nine studies ( N= 719 participants) included in the systematic review targeted physical
activity behaviour and none targeted sedentary behaviour. Six of the interventions eval-
uated were rated as promising –i.e. interventions with statistically signi ﬁcant between- or
within-group improvements in outcomes greater than those of the control or comparatorgroup (Gardner et al., 2016). All of these interventions involved an element of supervised
support that was tailored to individual needs. Both face-to-face and telephone contact
were identi ﬁed as promising modes of intervention delivery. The number of contacts
for promising interventions ranged from a single contact to 36 contacts, with the dur-
ation of interventions ranging from one single contact to twelve consecutive weeks.
Nine promising behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identi ﬁed with reference to
the BCT Taxonomy V1 (Michie et al., 2013) and considered for inclusion in our inter-
vention: information about health consequences; information about social and environ-
mental consequences; goal-setting behaviour; problem-solving; action planning;feedback on behaviour; biofeedback; social support unspeci ﬁed; and credible source.
Although the systematic review identi ﬁed some promising interventions and associ-
ated components, it highlighted the need for the development of a novel interventionthat addressed previous methodological and theoretical limitations and that incorporatedstroke survivor and HCP preferences.442 S. A. MOORE ET AL.
Qualitative focus group discussions
A series of interactive focus group discussions were conducted with stroke survivors and
HCPs. Stroke survivors were recruited by advert within the North East of England. Eli-
gibility criteria were broad and included stroke diagnosis, community dwelling and ableto access and attend focus group discussions. HCPs from ﬁve NHS North East England
stroke rehabilitation services were invited to take part in a focus group discussion. Eligi-
bility criteria for HCPs were: Quali ﬁed physiotherapist, technical instructor, physiother-
apy assistant; working in the NHS; currently working in stroke rehabilitation; and able to
access and attend the focus group. Participants were recruited until it was felt that data
saturation had been reached. The overall aim of the focus groups was to identify deter-minants of behavioural change for both stroke survivors and HCPs and to explore thebarriers and enablers to engage in long-term physical activity and reduction of sedentary
behaviour. A secondary aim was to add speci ﬁc context to the ﬁndings of our systematic
review, and to explore preferences around the intervention components identi ﬁed by the
systematic review. Focus group discussions were conducted in person, audio recorded
and transcribed verbatim. Topic guides were developed using the COM-B model explor-
ing how capability, opportunity and motivation interact to in ﬂuence behaviour. A pres-
entation explaining the overall aim of the focus group, de ﬁnitions of physical activity and
sedentary behaviour and the bene ﬁts of post-stroke activity was delivered at the start of
each focus group. Open-ended questions about pre- and post-stroke activity levels, andbarriers and enablers to engaging in physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviourafter stroke were subsequently explored with stroke survivors. HCPs were asked about
motivators, barriers and facilitators to supporting stroke survivors to be more physically
active and reduce sedentary behaviour. Each focus group lasted approximately one and ahalf hours.
Data were analysed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) (Cane,
O’Connor, & Michie, 2012) to facilitate an exploration of behavioural determinants
likely to predict and impact upon behaviour and behavioural change. Three researchers
(SAM, a clinical academic stroke physiotherapist, LA, a chartered health psychologist
with expertise in health behaviour change and qualitative research methods and amaster ’s degree student) read, re-read and analysed transcripts following the conduct
of each focus group discussion. Any unsubstantiated issues or points were explored
further during subsequent group discussions (i.e. topic guides were revised accordingly).The skill mix of the researchers ensured appropriate questions were asked and responseswere further probed for comprehensive understanding. Analyses of the data involved
assigning text segments to one or more domains of the TDF and generating themes
within each domain. All focus group transcripts with HCPs and stroke survivors werecoded and analysed by hand, i.e. no qualitative software was used. Common themes
across the stroke survivors and HCPs were subsequently established with regular meet-
ings held between researchers to discuss independent analyses and gain consensus.

physiotherapy assistants n= 2, working on the ward n= 5, working across ward and com-
munity n= 3, working in the community/outpatients n= 16) participated across 7 focus
groups. All 14 of the theoretical domains of the TDF were identi ﬁed from the data gen-
erated from stroke survivor focus groups. The most saliant domains were ‘environmental
context and resources ’,‘beliefs about consequences ’and ‘beliefs about capabilities ’
(Stroke survivor TDF domains themes with related change objectives are presented inTable 1 , Step 2).
Data generated from HCP focus groups identi ﬁed seven theoretical domains: ‘knowl-

most saliant domains that emerged from the data were ‘environmental context and

sented in Table 2 , Step 2).
Although the aim of the focus group discussions with stroke survivors was to explore
the determinants of behavioural change in relation to physical activity andsedentary
behaviour, participants focused their discussions on physical activity highlighting apotential lack of understanding and awareness about sedentary behaviour and the roleTable 1. Continued.

it plays in stroke rehabilitation. As such, a need for the development of an intervention to
target sedentary behaviour as well as physical activity behaviour was identi ﬁed.
Lack of sustainable physical activity options was identi ﬁed as a key barrier by stroke
survivors with a lack of timely information and long-term support also reported.Enablers to increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour were identify-
ing meaningful, accessible, sustainable activities with social support and developing skills
for self-monitoring physical activity and well-being, e.g. linking a change to behaviourswith improvements in activities of daily living were considered vitally important. HCPs
also identi ﬁed environmental context and access to resources as barriers to promoting
physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour, as well as a lack of skills to e ﬀectively
support behaviour change, particularly when stroke survivors presented signi ﬁcant bar-
riers and challenges.
Exploration of intervention opportunities within existing pathways
To identify current stroke rehabilitation services and explore potential for delivering
the intervention within existing pathway s, a questionnaire was sent to North East
England community stroke teams. Questions explored current and future sta ﬃng,
current service provision, and potential for participation in a future intervention
study. Community stroke services at seven North East NHS Trusts were consideredfor inclusion. Four of these Trusts were al ready involved in ano ther rehabilitation
study led by the research team; therefore it was agreed that they would not be
approached to reduce burden.
Keyﬁndings of exploration of existing pathways
Participating trusts did not report any speci ﬁc interventions or resources already in
place to target free-living physical acti vity and sedentary behaviour and reported
having an interest, capacity and manager ag reement to take part in a future feasibility
study (Appendix A).
Keyﬁndings of needs assessment
The needs assessment highlighted that physical activity and sedentary behaviour are not
adequately addressed post-stroke and HCPs do not feel equipped to target these behaviourseﬀectively. Findings indicated that the intervention should be adaptable to individual
needs, circumstances and preferences. A supported self-management approach was con-
sidered most appropriate to target these requirements. Mapping of existing stroke rehabi-litation pathways revealed that there was a potential to incorporate a physical activity andsedentary behaviour intervention and training for HCP into current practice.
Step 2: identi ﬁcation of behavioural outcomes, and speci ﬁcation of
performance and change objectives
The needs assessment conducted in Step 1 identi ﬁed the behaviours to target with our
intervention: Stroke survivors –physical activity and sedentary behaviour, HCPs –HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 447
consultation behaviour including knowledge about physical activity and sedentary
behaviour in the context of stroke and skills to e ﬀectively target behaviour change.
The two behavioural outcomes of the PARAS intervention, related performance objec-tives (tasks required) and change objectives (i.e. aspects of behaviour individuals arerequired to learn, do or change) that need to be accomplished by stroke survivors and
HCPs in order to achieve the behavioural outcomes and performance objectives were
developed with reference to the TDF domains and domain-speci ﬁc themes identi ﬁed
in Step 1. These are described in Tables 1 and2.
Step 3: selection of theory-based intervention content
Selection of the theories/models to underpin the behaviour change intervention were
informed by the ﬁndings of steps 1 and 2.
Theoretical underpinning of the stroke survivor component of the intervention
Two theories were selected to underpin the stroke survivor component of the multifa-
ceted intervention, the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, Strecher, & Becker, 1998)
and Self-Regulation Theory (Leventhal, Brissette, & Leventhal, 1997). The Health
Belief Model assumes an individual ’s belief in the personal threat of an illness together
with their belief that the e ﬀectiveness of a health behaviour or action will determine
whether they change their behaviour (or not). Self-regulation Theory involves guidingan individual ’s own thoughts, behaviours and feelings to reach the goals. It was felt
that these two models/theories in combination were appropriate with speci ﬁc reference
to the ﬁndings generated by the qualitative research.
Step 1 informed theory selection to target individual perceptions of stroke and stroke
recurrence including the use and perceived bene ﬁts and disadvantages of physical activity
and inactivity. It was felt that the selected model was appropriate particularly aroundchallenging beliefs about the consequences of physical activity/inactivity and as such for-
mulate reasons/intentions for engaging in physical activity.
Self-Regulation Theory assumes that behaviour is goal-directed or purposive. Findings
from our systematic review and focus group discussions supported the need for speci ﬁc
strategies to target volition as well as motivation in recognition that maintenance of phys-
ical activity for stroke survivors can be particularly challenging given the level of cogni-
tive and physical e ﬀort required. Furthermore, inclusion of several speci ﬁc BCTs that
target self-regulation e.g. goal-setting behaviour; problem-solving; action planning; feed-
back on behaviour were identi ﬁed from the systematic review as promising.
Behaviour change techniques are the irreducible active ingredients of interventions
targeting behaviour change, and are useful to inform, describe, deliver and evaluate
behaviour change interventions as well as operationalising underpinning theory
(Michie et al., 2015). TDF domains were identi ﬁed from the data generated from
stroke survivor focus group discussions and BCTs were selected with reference to
those domains, supported by evidence from the systematic review (i.e. BCTs identi ﬁed
by the review as promising). When discrepancies occurred between the ﬁndings of the
qualitative study and the systematic review, research team discussion led to a consensusagreement in terms of inclusion/exclusion of speci ﬁc BCTs. The outcome of the decision-448 S. A. MOORE ET AL.

making process is summarised in Table 3 which also describes theoretical constructs tar-
geted and intervention components which were further developed in Step 4.
Theoretical underpinning of the HCP component of the PARAS intervention
Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986) was selected to underpin the HCP component
of the multifaceted intervention. This theory was considered appropriate with reference
to the ﬁndings of the focus group discussions with HCPs during Step 1. For example,
HCPs highlighted the need for speci ﬁc knowledge and skills development training that
would enable them to attain speci ﬁc practice-related goals. These included promoting
and supporting an increase in physical activity to enable improvements in speci ﬁc func-
tional outcomes of patients. Social Cognitive Theory provides speci ﬁc examples of evi-
dence-based strategies for translating motivation/intentions into action/behaviour in
HCPs through the use of modelling to increase skills and self-e ﬃcacy (Godin et al.,
2008). Focus group data supported the need for modelling to facilitate skill acquisition
and target beliefs about capabilities.
The selection of BCTs incorporated into the HCP component of the intervention was
also informed by ﬁndings from the qualitative focus group discussions conducted as part
of Step 1. The decision-making process is summarised in Table 4 which also describes
theoretical constructs targeted and intervention components.
Step 4: development of the PARAS intervention
Following the intervention mapping exercise outlined in Step 3, a prototype intervention
was developed and presented to stroke survivors and HCPs for feedback during work-
shops and by questionnaire to inform further iterations.
Stroke survivor consultation workshops
We conducted three consultation workshops with stroke survivors ( n= 21) recruited
from local stroke community groups with an aim to elicit views on intervention
content, form and mode of delivery. Examples of potential intervention tools (workbook,
physical activity diary, information on apps accessible on mobile phone, pedometers)were circulated during workshops to generate discussion and obtain feedback. During
theﬁrst two workshops ( n= 13 stroke survivors) a feedback form was used to collate
opinions/information (Appendix B). To ensure the intervention could be used bystroke survivors with aphasia (impairment of language), the third workshop was con-
ducted with the North East Aphasia Research User Group ( https://www.neta.org.uk/ )
(n= 8 stroke survivors). This workshop was delivered using strategies to enable under-
standing of language and verbal rather than written feedback was collated. Alongside
review of the intervention content and tools, prototype aphasia friendly consent and
patient information sheets were reviewed by the group for use during a future feasibilitystudy (Appendix C and D). All three workshops were audio-recorded and transcribedverbatim to facilitate the intervention development processes.454 S. A. MOORE ET AL.

Keyﬁndings of stroke survivor consultation workshops
A detailed overview of workshop ﬁndings is provided in Appendix E. In summary, par-
ticipants reported a preference for the intervention to be supported by HCPs and deliv-ered either at home or in a community outpatient setting. There was a preference for atleast two sessions, with the ﬁrst session delivered face-to-face and subsequent sessions
delivered either face-to-face or by telephone. The majority (>75%) of stroke survivors
either strongly agreed or agreed that the prototype intervention workbook and physicalactivity diaries were well organised and easy to use. Eight commercially available ped-
ometers that have been used successfully in other physical activity studies (Carroll
et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2017; Sullivan et al., 2014) were presented to stroke survivors
during the workshop. The CSX 301S 3D simple pedometer was considered the most
appropriate and was the only pedometer to be voted by all participants as easy to use
and something they would be likely to use to facilitate self-monitoring.
HCP feedback
An online questionnaire was completed by four North East community stroke teams
(n= 11 HCPs) to elicit feedback on the prototype intervention. These teams had pre-
viously expressed an interest in reviewing the intervention and taking part in a futurefeasibility study.
Keyﬁndings of HCP feedback
Feedback in relation to the intervention design and content was largely positive (Appen-
dix E). Team 2, 3 and 4 strongly agreed or agreed with the suitability of the intervention,
tools and mode of delivery. Team 2 were uncertain about whether they could deliver theintervention within their team because they reported discharging patients to other reha-
bilitation services (i.e. follow-up reviews might not be possible to review goals, provide
feedback and discuss problem solving).
Team 1 were concerned about whether their patients would be suitable for the inter-
vention. They perceived the intervention to be for ‘high functioning ’patients who mayTable 4. Continued.

have been discharged from their service before undertaking the intervention. A further
meeting was held with Team 1 to provide more detail that could enable a more informed
decision regarding potential participation in a feasibility study of the intervention (e.g. tofurther emphasise that the intervention was not speci ﬁcally aimed at ‘high functioning ’
patients and could be tailored to individual needs and preferences). Following this
meeting, Team 1 agreed they could potentially deliver the intervention.
Step 5: formulation of an implementation plan
An important consideration for the implementation plan was that it targeted all three
pillars of high-quality care: patient experience, safety and e ﬀectiveness (Darzi, 2018).
To increase the likelihood of implementation, the APEASE criterion: a ﬀordability; prac-
ticability; e ﬀectiveness and cost-e ﬀectiveness; acceptability; side e ﬀects/safety and equity
(Michie, Atkins, & West, 2014) were applied to the intervention design. The ﬁnal com-
ponents of the intervention, named Physical Activity Routines After Stroke ‘PARAS ’, can
be viewed in Table 5 . The PARAS intervention targets stroke survivor physical activity
and sedentary behaviour via a supported self-management programme and HCP consul-
tation behaviour via a training programme. The stroke survivor and HCP components of
the intervention are described in Table 5 using the Template for Intervention Description
and Replication (TIDieR) framework. Table 5 also outlines how the APEASE criterion
informed selectin of each intervention component.
Step 6: development of an evaluation plan
To further develop and optimise the intervention within community stroke settings, in
accordance with the MRC framework, the next step was to develop an intervention evalu-
ation plan. Therefore, a protocol for a study determining the feasibility of the PARAS
intervention, was developed (Moore et al., 2020). The feasibility study is registered on
the ISRCTN website (Trial identi ﬁer: ISRCTN35516780, date of registration: 24/10/
2018 URL http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN35516780).
Discussion
Low levels of physical activity and high levels of sedentary behaviour are common follow-
ing stroke (Moore et al., 2013) and are associated with cardiovascular health, mental
health and quality of life (Moore et al., 2014). An intervention development process,
informed by the MRC guidelines for the development and evaluation of complex inter-
ventions, (Craig et al., 2013) using Intervention Mapping as a framework (Bartholomew
et al., 2011) was undertaken to target physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the
context of stroke rehabilitation as part of the routine care pathway in acknowledgement
that stroke survivors have speci ﬁc information and support requirements. An initial
needs assessment identi ﬁed a lack of e ﬀective theory-and-evidence informed interven-
tions targeting long-term free-living physical and sedentary behaviour in stroke survivors
(Moore et al., 2018) and our qualitative work identi ﬁed the need to develop a timely, sus-
tainable person-centred supported self-management intervention to address thisproblem.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 457

Components provided to/used by healthcare professionals
.Consent form and participant information sheet
.HCP training brochure
.DictaphoneAﬀordability: Portable document format (PDF) ﬁles of all the
intervention tools were created, printed out and stored in aworkbook ﬁle meaning extra patient speci ﬁc sheets could be
added to individual ’sﬁles (e.g. physical activity diary). This process
allowed iterative changes to be made without large costs ofreprinting manuals. Rather than creating a website with largecosts linked to maintenance and development, it was decided totrial a paper-based version of the intervention initially which couldbe developed online at a later date.The pedometer selected had a relatively low price point (£16.99)to enable increased sued with NHS settings.
Practicability : HCPs were provided with a PARAS kitbag holding all
the intervention tools so they could deliver the intervention then
and there rather than having to for example ﬁnd out information
about available resources and get back to participants at a laterdate.
Acceptability: all components tested at co-design workshops and
developed iteratively in response to feedback
Equity: The stroke survivor intervention tools were designed to be
inclusive so individuals with speech and language or cognitivediﬃculties would not be excluded as is the case in the majority of
stroke research studies.
What: procedures : Describe each of the procedures, activities,
and/or processes used in the intervention, including anyenabling or support activities.Stroke survivor procedures
Supported self-management programme involving goal setting,action planning, barrier identi ﬁcation, coping planning and
feedback around PA and sedentary behaviour.
HCP procedures
Training programme aimed at developing physical/sedentary
behaviour counselling skills of HCPs. Initial training beforedelivery of intervention then feedback provided on delivery.Acceptability, a ﬀordability and practicability : Supported self-
management was identi ﬁed as the most appropriate mode of
delivery for the stroke survivor component following our needsassessment and co-design workshops. This type of interventionappears more sustainable than for example face-to-face
structured group exercise which presents with a number of
environmental and resource related barriers.
Acceptability and e ﬀectiveness: Although HCPs working in community
stroke care will have some experience of goal setting etc.qualitative workshops identi ﬁed there were training needs in this
area and it was acceptable to target these needs.

A healthcare professional (HCP) who is a credible source (e.g.well informed on stroke rehabilitation) and plays a key role in thestroke survivors community rehabilitation e.g. physiotherapist,occupational therapist, nurse.
Provider of HCP component
Health psychologist with experience in delivering behaviourchange interventions in long-term conditions, researchphysiotherapist with 20 years clinical experience and 10 yearsresearch experience in developing and delivery physical activityand rehabilitation stroke interventionsAﬀordability, practicability and acceptability : PARAS focus groups
identi ﬁed delivery of the stroke survivor component should be by
a healthcare professional with experience working in stroke. Usinghealthcare professionals embedded within community stroketeams meant these individuals already had specialist core strokeskills meaning training was not required in this area alongsidetraining in PARAS delivery. As the intervention was designed to bedelivered within usual care this meant there were not additionalsalary costs. Initially consideration was made to include technicalinstructors and rehab assistants however on discussion with theseindividuals it was felt they would prefer to support the deliveryrather than lead on the delivery and that they were not happy tobe audio-recorded as part of the ﬁdelity assessment.
Acceptability and e ﬀectiveness : As the providers of the HCP training
had developed the intervention and were experienced in this ﬁeld
from both a therapy and a psychology perspective they werethought to be the most credible source to deliver the training.Practicability: At this feasibility stage it was decided that two
members of the research team would deliver the HCP trainingface-to-face. This allowed the research team to highlight anyiterative changes required to the training programme beforescaling.
How: Describe the modes of delivery (e.g. face-to-face or by
some other mechanism, such as internet or telephone) of theintervention and whether it was provided individually or in agroupStroke survivor component
First session face-to-face, follow-up sessions either face-to-faceor remotely by phone dependent on patient choice.
HCP training component
Face-to-face for initial training, then email and phone contact to
provide feedbackAcceptability: The modes of delivery were assessed as acceptable
from our needs assessment, co-design workshops andquestionnaires.
Aﬀordability and practicality : Our qualitative work indicted that this
mode of delivery of the stroke survivor intervention was practical.
As the community HCP involved in delivering the stroke survivor
component were already working with the stroke survivorsparticipating in the study it was practical for them to initially seethe participants face-to-face. To lower travel costs the option ofproviding the review sessions by phone was providedAcceptability, a ﬀordability and practicality : The HCPs were very
clear that they wanted training face-to-face as they felt E-Learningwas not e ﬀective. The HCP component was delivered in a group
format to each of three community teams involved. This reducedcosts of training individuals. Delivering three spate sessions ratherthan delivering the training to everyone at once meant that thetraining could be ﬁtted around the needs of each service.

HCP training component
Initial face-to-face training delivered at participating communitystroke teams ’education centres.Acceptability: Our needs assessment, co-design workshops and
resource capacity mapping exercise within services identi ﬁed the
acceptability of the intervention location.
Practicality: It was hypothesised that delivering the stroke survivor
intervention within patients homes would allow the HCP toprovide better support to the participants as they would have anincreased understanding of the participants environmentalcircumstances. This was felt to outweigh costs associated withcommunity visits.
Aﬀordability: Although travelling to the community sites to deliver
the HCP training had cost implications, it was believed more HCPwould attend if the trainers travelled to the participants. In the
future, it is thought that this training could be delivered online but
at this stage to enable as much knowledge on delivery face-to-face training was deemed most appropriate.
When and how much: Describe the number of times the
intervention was delivered and over what period of timeincluding the number of sessions, their schedule, and theirduration, intensity or dose.Stroke survivor component
At least two sessions. The ﬁrst session/s targets goal setting
using the workbook and other tools, there will then be a reviewsession timed to coincide with review date for PA/sedentarybehaviour goals. There is no upper limit to sessions the numberis deﬁned by patients ’support needs/availability of resources.
The programme to be initiated once ‘functional rehab ’goals
have been achieved and the stroke survivor is moving towardssupported self-management. The time from stroke will varydependent on needs of participant/health care professional ’s
opinion on the best timing/availability of resources.
HCP training component
Three-hour face-to-face training session. Email and phonedelivery support by study team. Email feedback on the deliveryof the intervention after completion with two stroke survivors.Acceptability: Our needs assessment and co-design workshops
identi ﬁed what was acceptable in terms of timing and dose of
delivery of the components of the intervention.
Side e ﬀects/safety: Our needs assessment and co-design workshops
provided evidence that the intervention training and deliverymethods would be safe with minimal side e ﬀects. As the stroke
survivors were already being seen by a community stroke teamwith specialist skills it was felt that this team would be able toeﬀectively identify any risks associated with taking part in the
intervention and potential changes in physical/sedentarybehaviour.
Eﬀectiveness : It was hypothesised that all the components of the
stroke survivor intervention could be delivered e ﬀectively within
the two or more sessions.
It was also hypothesised that all elements of the stroke survivor
intervention delivery could be taught e ﬀectively within three
hours with email and phone contact for support during delivery
Aﬀordability : The supported self-management approach for the
stroke survivor component provided a more a ﬀordable but at the
same time potentially e ﬀective method of delivery than for
example a face-to-face exercise intervention.

The HCP training was tailored according to personal needsduring the face-to-face training, email and telephone support.All participating HCPs received feedback on delivery that wastailored to their individual learning needs.Acceptability: The needs assessment, co-design workshops and
questionnaires were used to assess the acceptability of tailoring.
Aﬀordability: To enable e ﬀectiveness our needs assessment
identi ﬁed that a person centred individual tailored approach was
required for the stroke survivors. This approach is potentially moreexpensive than a group based approach, however the increasedpotential for e ﬀectiveness should outweigh these costs.
Equity: the stroke survivor component was designed to allow a
person-centred tailored approach that would not exclude anystroke survivor who has the potential to move more or sit less.

Acceptability: The main issue brought up by the HCPs during the
devlopment phase was the need to audio-record the interventiondelivery. When it was discussed that this approach was todetrmine whether our training programme was appropaite theHCPs stated they thought this was acceptable. Whether this wasactually the case will be further tested in a feasbility study.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 461
Historically, structured exercise has been the most common mode of targeting phys-
ical activity after stroke (Saunders et al., 2020). Although structured exercise can lead to
short-term changes in function, how this mode of delivery impacts on long-term healthand well-being has not been established. Perhaps more importantly, our qualitativeresearch mirrored previous ﬁndings indicating that many barriers exist to this approach
in terms of implementation e.g. resources, training, access and costs that make it unsus-
tainable for many stroke survivors (Nicholson et al., 2012). Furthermore, structured exer-
cise does not account for individual physical activity needs and preferences. Our
qualitative work indicated that stroke survivors wish to partake in activities that
provide meaning to their lives and allow them to recapture activities they engaged inprior to experiencing a stroke. This may be through structured exercise, but more com-
monly reported was engagement in day-to-day activities such as washing the car, shop-
ping, or playing with grandchildren. This ﬁnding supports previous qualitative work
undertaken in stroke (Nicholson et al., 2012). It was, therefore, important that the inter-
vention developed was person-centred rather than ‘one size ﬁts all ’. The implementation
mapping process led to the development of a supported self-management interventiondelivered at an appropriate time point within the rehabilitation pathway, tailored to indi-vidual needs with training for HCPs delivering the intervention. This training was
designed to provide HCPs with speci ﬁc evidence-informed education about physical
activity and sedentary behaviour in the context of stroke, and competency in usingBCTs to target problem solving for example.
There is an expectation within self-manag ement in stroke and at a governmental
level that person-held experience is incorporated into healthcare interventiondesign (Kulnik et al., 2019 ). Early engagement with stroke survivors and HCPs
during the intervention development pr ocess was a key strength of this study,
which can potentially enable future imple mentation, with those taking part in the
process becoming champions for the intervention (Clarke et al., 2017 ). Aphasia is a
common communication problem a ﬀecting approximately one-third of stroke survi-
vors (Engelter et al., 2006 ). Engaging with patients with aphasia during co-design is
complex and as a result is often not undertake n leading to interventions that are inap-
propriate for this population and leaving a s ub-population unsupported. In previous
self-management inter ventions in stroke, up to 46% of st udies have excluded individ-
uals with aphasia limiting extrapolation of ﬁndings to large numbers of stroke survi-
vors (Brady, Fredrick, & Williams, 2013 ). One of the strengths of our intervention
development process which may enable implementation was engagement with a
group of stroke survivors with aphasia, and the incorporation of their views into
the intervention design.
Alongside the incorporation of user views, another strength of the study was the use of
the APEASE criteria to consider the social context of intervention delivery to facilitateimplementation (Michie et al., 2014). Our systematic review highlighted that the majority
of RCTs and pilot studies in this ﬁeld have been led by research teams, not clinicians, and
attempts have not been made to embed testing within existing clinical pathways and set-
tings (English et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016; Moore et al., 2018; Preston et al., 2017). The
PARAS intervention was developed with implementation into the clinical care pathway
in mind, because implementation of research ﬁndings into rehabilitation settings has462 S. A. MOORE ET AL.
demonstrated previously to be slow, with evidence often not in ﬂuencing practice (Morris
et al., 2020).
Our needs assessment highlighted that the intervention should be multi-faceted, tar-
geting both the behaviour of the stroke survivors and the behaviour of the HCPs provid-ing support. This is a novel approach in this ﬁeld, where most interventions focus
exclusively on stroke survivors and those providing interventions being expected to do
so without training or support. Our qualitative work indicated that stroke survivorshave a preference to be supported by a HCP, therefore it was important to consider
behavioural change counselling strategies for use by HCPs to enable this. It could be
argued that HCPs already have skills to support these long-term behavioural changes,however, observational data on habitual physical activity and sedentary behaviour
post-stroke (Fini et al., 2017) indicates the contrary and the ﬁndings of our qualitative
study highlighted the need for training in this area. Previous research further suggeststhat perceptions on physical activity post-stroke vary between stroke survivors, informal
carers and HCPs, (Morris et al., 2015) therefore training on how to deliver person-
centred support to enable meaningful engagement in physical activity, which is morelikely to result in long-term change, may be required.
It is anticipated that the application of c omplex intervention development pro-
cesses will increase the likelihood of future e ﬀectiveness and implementation of the
intervention. However, several limita tions associated with our developmental
process should be acknowledged. Stroke survivors that took part in the initial qualitat-
ive focus group discussions were required to travel, meaning only those who had
access to transport or were mobile could atten d. In addition, invitat ions to participants
in these groups were advertised mainly at local stroke groups or patient carer panels
which may have limited representation of a general stroke population. Although we
advertised for informal car ers to attend the focus groups, only three took part and
information contributed was minimal and d id not enable formal anal yses. Therefore,
this limited our understanding from a carer perspective. The HCPs recruited may not
have been representative as they were self-selected limiting generalisability. The
majority were physiotherapists and assistant s, rather than from the broad range of dis-
ciplines who may also have been suitable to deliver the intervention e.g. nurses, occu-
pational therapists, speech and langua ge therapists, exercise on referral/ ﬁtness
instructors.
Conclusions
Eﬀectively targeting complex behaviours such as physical activity and sedentary behav-
iour post-stroke requires systematic and iterative development of evidence and theoryinformed interventions. Alongside e ﬀectiveness, the likelihood of adoption, implemen-
tation and sustainability of an intervention should also be considered during the devel-
opment process. We have presented the development of an intervention, grounded instroke survivor and service provider perspectives that targets long-term habitual physical
activity and sedentary behaviour post-stroke. Throughout the developmental process,
there was active engagement of stroke survivors and HCPs to increase likelihood ofthe acceptability and e ﬀectiveness of the intervention and long-term implementation.
The PARAS intervention is currently being testing in three North East communityHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 463
stroke services and the results of this feasibility study will further inform development.
Following the MRC guidelines for the development and evaluation of complex interven-
tions, the intervention will be further evaluated assessing e ﬃcacy, cost-e ﬀectiveness and
process.
