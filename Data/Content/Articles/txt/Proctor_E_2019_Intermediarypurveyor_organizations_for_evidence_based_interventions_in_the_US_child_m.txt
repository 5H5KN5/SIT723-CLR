Abstract
Background: Many psychosocial interventions are disseminated and supported by organizations, termed “Intermediary/
Purveyor Organizations ”(IPOs). Because IPOs remain largely unstudied, we lack understanding of their scale and the
strategies they utilize. The role and function of organization s that link resource systems with user systems, such as IPOs,
have been identified as an important but understudied issue i n implementation science. The objectives of this paper are
to describe features of IPOs that dissemina te evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for child behavioral health and identify
the strategies they use to support their implementation.
Methods: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and
Practices (NREPP) listed 119 unique IPOs for the 127 child behavioral health EBIs listed on its website. Data characterizing
each organization were drawn from NREPP and GuideStar profiles. From 119 unique IPOs identified, we found contact
information for 108. We sent an electronic survey to capture a dditional organizational information and implementation
strategies the IPOs employed in spreading the EBIs; response rate was 50%. Data are presented descriptively and analyzed
using ordinary least squares (OLS) regr ession and Latent Class Analysis (LCA).
Results: Virtually all identified EBIs had an IPO. IPOs train indi viduals, organizations, an dc o m m u n i t i e sa n dp r o v i d e
supervision for the use of EBIs. About 20% of IPOs trained at large scale, some training 500 –1000+ providers annually.
IPOs reported using an average of 32 distinct strategies to implement their EBIs, with most using educational, planning,
and quality improvement strategies. However, there was little convergence around strategy helpfulness. The only
significant predictor of number of strategies used by an IPO was the NREPP-posted implementation readiness score of
the intervention. LCA revealed that IPOs either used several implementation strategies or used very few.
Conclusions: Findings add significantly to knowledge about IPO structure, scale, and function. They use numerous and
varying implementation strategies but report little co nsensus in what works. The study advances methods for
measuring and characterizing real-world implementation by demonstrating the feasibility of using a common
nomenclature, per a published compilation and of LCA for data reduction in characterizing profiles of implementation
approaches.

Background
A recent Institute of Medicine of the National Academies
(IOM) [ 1] report decries the gap between the availability
and receipt of evidence-based psychosocial interventions
(EBIs) for mental health disorders. Psychosocial EBIs have
limited scale; although between 13 and 20% of children
and youth experience a mental disorder each year [ 2],
most do not receive EBIs. Bruns et al. report that uptake
of mental health treatment for children and youth lags
significantly behind adults, with EBIs reaching only 1 –3%
of youths with serious emotional disturbance [ 3]. Such
data reflect the struggle to scale-up EBI adoption rates to
the point where they substantially influence public health
on a national scale.
EBI scale-up is limited because of weaknesses in the
“distribution system ”for bringing treatment discoveries
to the attention of practitioners and into practice settings
[4]. Unlike drugs and devices, psychosocial interventions
have no Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-like delivery
system. Instead, distribution is often dependent on the ini-
tiative of treatment developers, who lack the resources of
an organization such as the FDA. Many treatment devel-
opers form organizations to spread information about and
provide support for the adoption of their interventions.
Such organizations have been called Intermediary/
Purveyor Organizations (IPOs) [ 5,6]. Well-known
IPOs include such internati onal entities as Trauma-
Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy National Therapist
Certification Program, Nurse -Family Partnerships, and
Triple P International and their subsidiary, and Triple P
America. IPOs have emerged as a major dissemination
strategy over the past two decades.
IPO theory and functions
The term IPO combines two key constructs in the dis-
semination and implementation literature: purveyor and
intermediary. Purveyor has been defined as “an individual
or group of individuals representing a program or practice
who actively work to implement that practice or program
with fidelity and good effect ”[5]. Intermediary organiza-
tions have been described as “…developing, implementing,
and supporting multiple best practice programs or ser-
vices, as well as building the capacity within an agency or
system in order to implement and sustain such programs ”
[6–8]. Intermediary roles also include consultation, quality
assurance, and continuous quality improvement; outcome
evaluation; and training [ 6,8]. The limited research on
these organizations suggests that many organizations
identify as both purveyors and intermediaries [ 6].
The IPO definition and role reflect several key concepts
in the implementation science literature, concepts that are
widely used but often with overlapping meaning, such as
change agency, knowledge broker, or resource system.
Many of these terms can be traced conceptually to diffusionof innovation theory [ 9], but the proliferation of terms may
cloud understanding and thwart the harmonization of con-
cepts and data for the field of implementation science.
In order to diffuse, disseminate, and help implement
psychosocial interventions, most of these organizations
probably engage in many of the core functions of distribu-
tion systems. These functions include “identify potential
users, promote the product to them, provide them with
easy access to the product through convenient (and usu-
ally local) channels, allow them to see and use the product
before acquiring it, help them acquire it, and support
the product after purchase if the buyer has questions or
problems [ 4].”
Many IPOs function to spread particular EBIs, having
been established by treatment developers after research to
shape the intervention and test effectiveness. Such IPOs
bring content expertise in one or two specific interventions
to practitioners and agencies. Some such organizations
may hold patents or copyrights to the name or training in
the EBI. Other IPOs appear to be agnostic toward the spe-
cific EBIs they promote. Sometimes labeling themselves
“intermediaries, ”they often work to find the best interven-
tion fit for a specific organization ’sn e e d s ,l i n kr e s o u r c e s
(including perhaps EBI-specific IPOs) to users, and provide
coaching about implementation processes that are applic-
able to implementation of any innovation. In their efforts
to find the best intervention fit for a specific organization ’s
needs, they may help users implement a variety of EBIs.
W h i l es p e c i f i cE B I sh a v ea ne x t e n s i v eb o d yo fr e s e a r c h ,a
more limited literature describes the role and function of
IPOs. See for example literature describing such organiza-
tions as the National Center for Nurse-Family Partnerships
and Healthy IDEAS [ 10,11]. These organizations dissem-
inate and train providers in EBIs for optimizing child
development and treating geriatric frailty and depression,
respectively. We found only one empirical study of IPOs.
Franks and Bory presented survey data reflecting IPO
organizational identity, development, activities, and func-
tions [ 6]. Given the proliferation of terms and the paucity
of research focused on IPOs, we lack understanding of
their respective functions and the strategies they utilize
[12–15]. The dissemination and implementation literature
has identified understanding the role and function of
organizations who link resource systems with user sys-
tems, such as IPOs, as an important but understudied
issue [ 16]. Greater understanding of their structure,
sustainability, and operations is needed to help clarify

Methods
Sample
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
(SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence-based Programs
and Practices (NREPP) served as the sampling frame for
this study. NREPP is the federally managed and vetted
registry of mental health EBIs and is designed to be a
practical decision-making tool to assist clinicians in select-
ing efficacious treatments [ 17–20].
All EBIs housed in NREPP have been reviewed and
scored by trained experts. Useful information for practi-
tioners is extracted from and uniformly formatted in an
easy-to-read report [ 21]. It is a highly utilized site with
30,052 unique visitors accessing it every month [ 22].
Though it does not purport to house all existing EBIs,
its registry has grown considerably from its initial 25
interventions to a bank of 388 vetted EBIs at the time
of our search, June 2015 [ 21,22].
Our sample was generated using the advanced search
function of NREPP. NREPP is searchable by intervention,
rather than by IPO, so the inclusion criteria were based on
intervention type and characteristics. Inclusion criteria for
the sample: (1) EBI was designated by NREPP as “mental
health treatment ”or“mental health promotion, ”(2) the
EBI was designed for children up to age 17, and (3) the
EBI’s primary outcomes were mental health related.
Mental health-related outcomes included one of the
following terms in their outcome description: depression,
anxiety, trauma, behavioral disorder, disruptive behavior,
substance use, social emotional disorder, aggression, or
impulsivity. The resultant pool of EBIs was 127.
A member of the research team examined the EBI
profiles to identify the intervention ’s IPO. From the 127
EBIs, 119 unique IPOs were identified.
Data
The first research objective was addressed by reviewing
NREPP ’s profiles of the EBIs to see which reported having
an IPO. We determined whether an EBI had an IPO
based on whether or not the NREPP web site listed anorganization for the EBI. To address the remaining re-
search objectives, data were obtained from four sources:
the IPO ’s NREPP profile, the IPO ’sG u i d e S t a rp r o f i l e( i f
the IPO was non-profit), the IPO ’s website, and IPO key
informant responses to an electronic survey.
A member of the research team extracted data from the
aforementioned web-based sources for each IPO. These
data included contact information, website, date IPO was
established, location, availability of training materials, how
training was administered, and availability of provider
certification, fidelity tools, and fidelity monitoring. For
IPOs with GuideStar profiles, organization financial in-
formation was extracted.
We retrieved a Readiness for Dissemination (RFD) score
for each EBI from the NREPP website. NREPP assigned
each intervention with an RFD score. The scores ranged
from 0 to 4, with high scores indicating that dissemination
resources are available and are of high quality. RFD was
assessed across three domains: availability of implemen-
tation materials, availability of training and support
resources, and availability of quality assurance procedures.
However, as of July 2015, the RFD score no longer included
an NREPP review and the scale is no longer used for newly
reviewed EBIs [ 21].
After initial data were gathered about the IPOs, the
research team developed an electronic survey in Qualtrics.
The research team contacted each IPO to determine
who in the organization was most familiar with the
IPOs’implementation practice. Of the 119 IPOs previ-
ously identified, contact information was secured for 108.
Respondents ’role within their respective IPOs varied. Our
initial invitation to participate in the survey asked to speak
with someone familiar with the organization ’s implemen-
tation efforts. Most of the role titles suggested that the
respondents were administrators within the IPO (direc-
tors, CEO, presidents, directors of training) or researchers
involved in the treatment ’s development.
The Qualtrics survey was emailed, with up to two
reminders. The response rate for fully completed surveys
was 50% ( N= 54). The first section of the survey was
designed to capture organizational characteristics not
available from the existing web content (e.g., number of
staff, specifics on training, cost, and funding).
The second portion of the survey was designed to cap-
ture the implementation strategies used by the IPOs. This
section was based on the implementation strategy inven-
tory organized by Powell, et al. [ 23]. The original inventory
of 68 strategies was piloted on individuals with expertise
in IPO operations within the sphere of child/youth mental
health services. The language of certain implementation
strategies was modified slightly to fit within the study ’s
context, and four strategies were excluded that did not
apply to the types of strategies these organizations could
employ, as determined by the content experts. The finalProctor et al. Implementation Science            (2019) 14:3 Page 3 of 14
inventory of 64 implementation strategies comprised the
second section of the survey. For each item, respondents
were asked whether they used or suggested the adopting
agency/provider use the listed strategy. In addition, re-
spondents were asked to select up to five strategies they
felt were most successful. We did not provide definitions
of success. We attempted to reduce social desirability
through language stating that no one organization would
be expected to use all strategies. Respondents were ex-
pected to interpret “success ”from their own perspective.
We did not ask respondents to identify situations or con-
texts in which strategies were used or deemed successful.
The responses to these items were used to estimate
domain-specific strategy profiles using LCA. Both sec-
tions of the survey were tested for usability by individ-
uals with experience working in or with IPOs.
In preparation for the LCA, an additional variable for
implementation strategies was created. The individual
implementation strategies identified were nested under
one of five possible domains: planning, education, financial,
restructure, and quality management [ 23]. To generate an
overall implementation score for each of these domains,
the number of strategies used in a domain was divided
by the number of available strategies in that domain.
The denominator for this score was based on the Expert
Recommendations for Implementation Change (ERIC)
compilation.
These domain-specific scores were then dichotomized
into high use and low use, based on a cutoff of the 50th
percentile. The resultant variable was a dichotomous
variable for each IPO per implementation strategy domain,
reflecting either high use or low use of strategies within
that domain. These items are utilized in estimating the
overall implementation strategy profile by LCA.
Analysis
Multiple data reduction strategies were used to address
our research objectives. The number of EBIs with active
contact information for the IPO or its representative was
divided by the number of IPOs. We used descriptive sta-
tistics to report IPO characteristics. Scores were assigned
to the implementation strategies based on the percentage
of IPOs who endorsed using the strategy and rating it as
most successful to their implementation efforts.
Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used as
part of an exploratory analysis to study the association
between IPO organizational characteristics and number
of implementation strategies used. The dependent vari-
able for the regression was the number of implementa-
tion strategies used by the IPO. The independent
variables included number of IPO staff, the EBI ’s
NREPP dissemination score, how many years the IPO
has been in operation, and the number of clinicians the
IPO has trained. The data were assessed to ensure thatnone of the assumptions of OLS were violated. Regres-
sion was executed in Stata v.14.
We used LCA to identify implementation strategy
profiles (or latent classes) in the sampled IPOs ( N= 54).
This allowed us to explore whether IPOs varied in
meaningful ways in the combination of implementation
strategies used. Prior to conducting this analysis, we
generated two profile levels. The first was an overall
implementation strategy profile based on the use of the
domain-level strategies (planning, education, finance,
restructure, and quality management). The second was
a domain-specific profile based on the use of specific
strategies within each domain.
An iterative process was used to determine the optimal
number of latent classes based on three different model
fit statistics: the likelihood-ratio G2statistic, Akaike ’s
Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) [ 24]. A significant result of a likelihood-ratio
test suggests that a more complicated model (i.e., “k”class
model) has a significantly better model fit than a simpler
model (i.e., “k-1”class model) [ 24]. A lower value on
the AIC and BIC suggests a more optimal model in balance
between model fit and parsimony [ 24].
Following the guidelines of methodological experts,
selection of the final model took into account these
model fit statistics, as well as an attentive examination
on model interpretability (i.e., Is each class distinguish-
able in terms of the pattern of implementation strategies
used? Is every class non-trivial in size? Can we define
each latent class in a meaningful way?) [ 24,25]. We used
“PROC LCA ”in SAS 9.4 for all LCA [ 26].
Results
Prevalence of IPOs
IPOs were widespread; virtually all of the EBIs appeared
to have an IPO, and the majority of them have active
contact information ( N= 108, 90.7%). IPOs represented
a substantial financial interest in both the public and
private sectors. Those IPOs with GuideStar profiles outlin-
ing organizational finances ( N= 11) showed a collective
annual revenue of 1.8 billion.
IPO characteristics
By nature, IPOs reported that they were training organiza-
tions. They train at the individual (85%), organizational
(84%), and community levels (33%). IPOs train at a variety
of sites: onsite where the EBI will be delivered (89%), at
IPO headquarters (58%), and online (47%). To get a sense
of IPO training volume, a series of ranges were offered to
IPOs for reporting the number of clinicians who com-
pleted training. In 2015, the modal range for completing
EBI training was 26 –50 clinicians. Approximately 11%
of IPOs reported a range of 251 –500 clinicians whoProctor et al. Implementation Science            (2019) 14:3 Page 4 of 14
completed training, and 9% of IPOs reported that over
1000 clinicians completed training.
Half of IPOs also offered individual-level certification in
their EBI. Slightly over one-quarter offered organization-
level certification, and one-tenth offered community-level
certification. In order to receive the individual-level certifica-
tion, 41% of IPOs required ongoing supervision which then
provided the IPO with an additional source of revenue.
IPOs reported multiple streams of revenue. Nearly all
IPOs (80%) received renumeration from their training
efforts. Grants (64%), treatment manual sales (55%),
and supervision fees (53%) were other frequently used
sources of income.
Implementation strategies employed
IPOs used an average of 32 (SD = 13.74) distinct strategies
in implementing EBIs, reflecting a wide range of ap-
proaches. IPOs endorsed a mean of 4.3 of five domains
based on the Powell et al. typology [ 23].
Table 1(third column) portrays IPOs ’endorsement of
particular implementation strategies. By domain, IPOs
heavily relied upon provider educational strategies, with
virtually all distributing educational materials, such as
intervention guidelines, manuals, and toolkits. Other
frequently employed educational strategies included vary-
ing their training methods (90.7%) and materials (88.9%)
to facilitate provider learning. Over 85% of IPOs followed
training with consultation or booster sessions.
Various planning strategies comprised the second most
frequently endorsed domain. Over 75% of IPOs reported
tailoring their work to address agency barriers and facilita-
tors, engaging champions for the EBI, and assessing
the readiness for change of the organizations in which
providers work. The only other domain with strategies
endorsed by 75% or more of IPOs was the quality domain.
Around three fourths of IPOs developed and introduced
quality monitoring tools specific to the EBI, and obtained
client feedback on the implementation effort. Two thirds
of IPOs endorsed one strategy within the finance domain:
encouraging agencies to access new funding to facilitate
the implementation process. Fewer than half of IPOs
endorsed any implementation strategies in the restructure
domain.
We also determined what percentage of the IPOs ’
strategies pertained to each domain (Table 2). Organized
by IPO, this table reiterates how the finance and restructure
domains comprised a smaller percentage of each IPOs ’
total strategies, with educational and planning strategies
dominating.
Implementation strategies identified as most successful
The last column in Table 1reflects the percent of IPOs
who endorsed a strategy as among the five most successful
of the employed strategies. The strategies most frequentlyendorsed as successful were following training with
booster or advanced sessions or training providers to
competency (46.3%). Over one third of IPOs endorsed
as most successful three additional strategies, two within
the educational domain —tailoring educational materials
and providing ongoing implementation consultation to
providers —and one in the planning domain —engaging
EBI champions.
Figure 1plots strategies by the percentage of IPOs
who endorsed their usage against the percentage of IPOs
who endorsed the same strategy as one of the most
successful. The four previously mentioned strategies (#22,
#26, #10, #4) comprise the small cluster of strategies that
were endorsed by over 30% of respondents. The plot
illustrates how there were various strategies endorsed as
frequently used and were not endorsed as being one of
the most successful.
IPO characteristics and implementation strategies used
For the exploratory analysis, the results of the multivariate
regression indicated that the included covariates explain
27% of the of the variance ( R2= .2706, F(4,46) = 4.27,
p< .01). The NREPP dissemination readiness score
significantly predicted the number of implementation
strategies used. Holding all other variables constant, each
one point increase on the NREPP score was associated
with an IPOs use of approximately eight more implemen-
tation strategies.
Implementation strategy profiles
Taking into account both the model fit indicators ( G2,
AIC, and BIC) and model interpretability, we consistently
found that the data supported a two-class model in gen-
eral. Model fit statistics are presented in Table 2.I na l l
profiles (overall and domain-specific), the two-class model
showed high entropy —a measure of certainty in latent
class classification, a value closer to one suggesting higher
certainty. Based on the pattern in class-based implementa-
tion strategy used (Fig. 2), we defined these two classes as
the“high-use ”group and the “low-use ”group.
The class-based use of each implementation strategy
(i.e., item-response probabilities) is presented in Fig. 2;
fit statistics and other details are found in Table 3.T h e
item response probability represents the likelihood that
a strategy (or domain in the overall model) was endorsed
by an IPO. For example, in the overall model, 100% of
IPOs classified as high-use, endorsed using one or more
planning strategies, while only 20% of those in the low-
use class did so. For the overall implementation strategy
profile, the patterns were quite distinct —high strategy
use compared to low strategy use. IPOs either reported a
high probability of using strategies within each domain
or a low probability of using strategies within a given

implementation strategies —across domains —or used
very few, with little variability in between.
While still maintaining high- vs low-strategy use pro-
files, some of the domain-specific profiles were more
nuanced than the overall profile. In the education domain,
for instance, both groups endorsed (1) developing educa-
tional materials to make it easier for stakeholders to learn
to implement or learn about the EBI; (2) distributing edu-
cational materials (e.g., guidelines, manuals, and toolkits)
in person, by mail, and/or electronically; ( 3) conducting
training in the EBI that included follow-up training,
advanced training, booster training, or training to compe-
tence; (4) varying training methods for different learning
styles, or shape the training to be interactive; and (5) pro-
viding clinicians with ongoing consultation from an expert
in the intervention. This was not surprising given nearly
all IPOs reported using these strategies. Given that
96.34% of IPOs used educational materials (ST20), the
actual variance between high- and low-use profiles was
nearly non-existent. Conversely, in the finance domain,
neither group had high probabilities of using three specific
payment approaches (paying providers for delivery of a
specific EBI, paying for outcomes, lowering costs of specific
EBIs—ST35, ST37, or ST38). Additionally, no IPO in either
finance profile reported usin g ST36, penalties for failing to
use EBIs.Limitations and strengths
While this paper adds to the limited body of evidence
about organizations focused on implementing evidence-
based child-focused behavioral health interventions, we
acknowledge a number of limitations. First, our analysis
focused only on EBIs for child behavioral health. Yet to
be explored are the dissemination and implementation
activities used by organizations focused on interventions
for health, adult behavioral health, child development,
and a variety of other issues such as corrections. We
drew our IPO list and corresponding readiness scores
from NREPP in July 2015; a few months later, NREPP
removed the readiness score. NREPP has been critiqued
about some of its criteria for intervention inclusion in
an“evidence-based ”list, with some researchers feeling
like the standards are not sufficiently rigorous [ 27].
Nonetheless, the IOM has noted the importance of
NREPP as a central hub to distribute information about
mental health EBIs [ 1] and NREPP is widely accessed
and unique in both its detail and scope. Our respon-
dents, key informants of IPOs themselves, reflect the
perspectives of only one implementation “actor ”—the
organizations that exist to roll out EBIs [ 28]. Results
would likely differ if reported from other implementa-
tion actors, such as agency directors or policy makers.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that our IPO prevalenceTable 1 Percentage of IPOs who use the strategy and rank it within their five most successful (Continued)

rates are underestimated due to the difficulty of discerning
the existence of certain IPOs from the available contact
information on NREPP , coupled with the fact that IPO
identification was conducted by one member of our team.
We also acknowledge limitations in measurement. As
reflected in prior research [ 6], capturing scale and cost
of IPO activities is challenging, requiring the provision of
ordinal ranges (for budget, staff size, providers trained)
rather than precise amounts, which we learned that most
IPOs cannot retrieve. Measures of organizational charac-
teristics, budgets, and EBI readiness scores were obtained
from independent, publicly available sites (and have been
used in prior research); however, we do not have data on
their validity. We used Powell, an established nomencla-
ture listing and labeling implementation strategies, but re-
spondents ’subjectively determined and reported their
strategy use and success with the strategies. WhileFranks & Bory asked (a convenience sample) of inter-
mediary organization informants to identify their tasks
[6], our measurement of dissemination and implementa-
tion strategies was based on a published compilation used
in studies of implementation in the Veterans Administra-
tion [ 23] but which we adapted to the IPO “actor”perspec-
tive. The “number of strategies ”employed is a blunt
measure. In this work and in the field at large, measure-
ment of implementation strategies is in early stages. How-
ever, the sheer number of strategies used seems to matter,
given recent findings that use of more strategies is associ-
ated with ability to deliver EBIs [ 29]. Because implementa-
tion strategies are generally not available through medical
records or archival data, self-report is the current state of
art for capturing their use.
Finally, we note that the OLS analysis is exploratory
and that our relatively small sample size limits theTable 2 The percentage of the strategies used by domain for each IPO (Continued)

generalizability of the LCA results. Specifically, it is
likely that class results (in our case, two classes) and
item-response probabilities would differ using larger
samples, particularly given the large number of strategies
available. However, we performed the LCA as a proof of
concept for a means to examine implementation strat-
egies, and in that regards, we found it to be a useful tool.Discussion
EBIs cannot be delivered unless they are adopted by ser-
vice-providing organizations. How EBIs reach providers,
and in turn consumers, remains poorly understood. Thus,
our project addresses a troubling gap in the current
literature. IPOs operate globally and across the span of
healthcare and are particularly important for psychosocial(See figure on previous page.)

interventions such as behavioral health. Unlike medica-
tions, whose adoption is fostered by strategic outreach by
the pharmaceutical industry, psychosocial interventions
have lacked a centralized distribution source of information
or technical assistance.
IPOs are big business. Collectively, with nearly two bil-
lion dollars in revenue, these organizations train thousands
of clinicians each year. Our own research experience tells
us that agency directors considering adoption of new
interventions often ask first, “how much will this cost? ”
Training, training materials, supervision, and certification
are the key sources of revenue. Information about the cost
of working with an IPO remains difficult to determine,
as evidenced by our IPO respondents stating that “it
depends. ”
Information about implementation strategies, for use
by distribution agents such as IPOs or by individual
agencies and providers, has only recently been compiled
[23,30]. Strategy compilations inform both implementa-
tion research and practice [ 31]. In 2017, SAMHSA
added a new resource to NREPP, the NREPP Learning
Center. The Learning Center offers resources to support
the selection, implementation, evaluation, and sustainment
of evidence-based programs and practices, along with
supporting materials in the form of case studies, stories,
and videos. A “how to implement ”page leads viewers to
the Powell et al. compilation of 68 implementation strat-
egies organized into 6 categories which also served as the
framework for data collection and analysis in the present
study. Regrettably, as of this writing, the future of NREPP
and the availability of its resources is unsure [ 32]. NREPP
is no longer maintained. This may hamper the opportunity
for providers and organizations to contact IPOs for imple-
mentation assistance.
Our results suggest that there is no uniform approach,
no magic bullet, to implementation. Nearly all IPOs
report using a large number of strategies —nearly three
dozens —in their efforts to roll-out EBIs, results aligned
with those of Rogal et al. (2017). Moreover, they use
strategies in most of the domains identified in the Powell
et al. compilation [ 23]. While many strategies in the
Powell compilation were rarely endorsed, we did find
some convergence in strategies most frequently used.
These include training, formal implementation planning,
providing ongoing consultation, engaging local champions,
and developing implementation materials.
In contrast to some convergence in strategies used, we
found little such convergence around which strategies
are most helpful to their work. No single strategy was
identified as among the most helpful by more than half
of IPOs. Training, which was used by nearly all IPOs,
was rated as among the most helpful by only 46% of
IPOs. The other most frequently employed strategies
were reported as among the most helpful by fewer than10% of IPOs. This may reflect the complexity of imple-
menting new interventions, or it may reflect that in the
absence of knowing what works, implementers use many
different approaches. These findings align with those
reported by Franks & Bory, indicating that IPOs are
engaged in tasks that they do not think are effective [ 6].
Conclusions
These findings raise a number of questions for further
research. Whether proprietary or not-for-profit, most
IPOs employ similar dissemination, training, and support
strategies. Research needs to examine the effectiveness of
these strategies. Given the high number of strategies used
by IPOs, is success a function of the number of strategies
used, or do particular strategies contribute disproportion-
ately to success? Recent evidence suggests that adoption
of EBIs may indeed be associated with using a high
number of strategies. Moreover, successful implementa-
tion likely depends on contextual factors and actions by a
number of actors. What is the unique contribution of an
IPO and what is required from the adopting organization,
their staff, and their service recipients? What IPO imple-
mentation strategies are effective in which organizational
and policy contexts [ 33]? And why do IPOs report wide-
spread use of implementation strategies in which they
have little confidence of success. A priority question for
the field is: which strategies are effective, in what context,
and for what types of EBIs? Given their preeminent role in
implementing evidence-based behavioral health interven-
tions, researchers need to address ways to enhance their
effectiveness by advancing understanding of strategy use,
measurement, and effectiveness.
