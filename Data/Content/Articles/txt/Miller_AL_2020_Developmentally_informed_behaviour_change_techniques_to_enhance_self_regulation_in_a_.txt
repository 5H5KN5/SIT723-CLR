ABSTRACT
Self-regulation (SR), or the ability to manage thoughts, emotions, and
behaviours in order to achieve a desired goal, is seen as underlying
positive health behaviours. In adults, behaviour change techniques (BCTs)
are recommended to promote SR across health domains; althoughestablishing healthy habits early in life is important, studies of SR and
health in children are rare. This conceptual review provides guidance on
developmental considerations for applying BCTs to enhance SR capacity
in children and youth with the goal of fostering positive behavioural
health trajectories early in the lifespan. Key considerations include thenature of developmental changes in SR and interaction among SR
processes; temporal associations between SR and health behaviours; and
relevance of health goals for children and youth. Building on a meta-
review of BCT ’s used to promote SR in adults and youth, this conceptual
review highlights key SR milestones to consider in behaviour change-
focused interventions from early childhood through adolescence and
provides an overview of social-ecologic in ﬂuences on SR development
and associations between SR and health behaviours across these ageperiods. Implications for and examples of using developmentally-informed
BCTs in interventions to enhance SR in children and youth are noted andsuggestions for future research are discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY

Self-regulation (SR) –broadly de ﬁned as managing thoughts, emotions, and behaviours in order to
achieve a desired goal –is thought to be a central mechanism underlying health behaviours (Eisen-
berg et al., 2019 ; Miller, Gearhardt, et al., 2018 ). Although many health problems facing the modern
world have broad social and contextual roots, individual factors such as SR are hypothesised to
modulate the extent to which environmental factors translate into health behaviours (Blair, 2017 ;
Nielsen et al., 2018 ). Individual di ﬀerences in SR can foster resilience, such that some individuals
engage in and maintain healthy behaviours in the face of stressors, whereas others do not(Hagger et al., 2019 ). Thus, SR may be a mechanism in the pathway to behaviour change in the
context of daily challenges to healthy behaviour. As SR can be malleable (Pandey et al., 2018 ) and
prevention of disease is typically more e ﬀective than treatment, SR-focused interventions early in
life o ﬀer promise for fostering positive behavioural health trajectories. Yet, health behaviour
studies rarely directly address SR in children or youth.
Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) such as self-monitoring and action planning have been
suggested to promote SR in adults (Michie et al., 2013 ). Few studies have explicitly considered the

use of BCTs among children or youth. For example, in a recent meta-review of 66 meta-analyses that
used BCTs to promote SR in health behaviour change interventions (Hennessy, Johnson, Acabchuk,McCloskey, & Stewart-James, 2019 ), only 5 meta-analyses included children. Yet, two of these high-
lighted developmental di ﬀerences in e ﬀectiveness of SR-related BCTs in promoting health beha-
viours, suggesting that a developmental perspective is important in using BCTs to promote SR andhealth behaviours in children and youth. Identifying BCTs to promote SR in children and youth is chal-
lenging due to the dramatic changes in SR capacities and the many inﬂ uences on SR across devel-
opment. SR develops rapidly during the ﬁrst years of life, aspects of SR interact and develop at
diﬀerent rates, and SR typically becomes more stable through adulthood (Samero ﬀ,2010 ). The
goal of this conceptual review is to raise awareness of developmental factors that are important
for investigators and interventionists alike to consider when tailoring BCTs to enhance SR with thegoal of health promotion across di ﬀerent developmental periods. As such, we review developmental
milestones in SR, inﬂ uences on SR, and SR-health behaviour associations from early childhood to ado-
lescence. We also provide examples of developmentally-informed applications of using BCTs toenhance SR across di ﬀerent developmental periods ( Table 1 ).
Developmental considerations regarding behaviour change techniques and self-
regulation
BCTs have been proposed as a way to promote SR and thus sustained health behaviour change (e.g.,
diet, physical activity, substance use, chronic illness management) (Hagger et al., 2019 ). The recent
meta-review suggested that certain BCTs, speci ﬁcally goal setting, prompt self-monitoring, and
identi ﬁcation of barriers and problem-solving, may be particularly important for promoting SR (Hen-
nessy et al., 2019 ). Health behaviour interventions often use such BCTs to promote SR in order to link
intentions to health behaviours, as intentions do not always translate into actions. For example,although an individual may intend to eat salad and exercise after work, barriers such as stress,desire for sedentary activity, or food cravings can get in the way. This process has been described
as a tension between ‘wants ’and ‘shoulds ’(Duckworth, Milkman, & Laibson, 2018 ), and may be
thought of as a con ﬂict between primarily bottom-up, reactive processes such as impulsivity,
versus more top-down, deliberate processes such as planning (Jonas & Kochanska, 2018 ; Nigg,
2017 ). Reactive processes are quick, often emotional or impulsive responses to stimuli, whereas
top-down processes involve slower, typically more complex, eﬀ ortful, or intentional responses that
can function to reframe or modulate initial response. SR-related challenges to health behaviourchange often emerge as a result of these two systems being ‘imbalanced. ’Although such dual-
process framing is oversimpli ﬁed, as these processes can interact and inﬂ uence each other in a bidir-
ectional manner, this framework is adopted to highlight these di ﬀerent processes as related to SR.
In order to develop e ﬀective BCTs to promote SR across the lifespan, it is ﬁrst important to under-
stand developmental aspects of SR that have implications for health behaviour. There is a vast litera-
ture on SR development, and recent reviews in developmental science (Bailey & Jones, 2019 ; Jonas &
Kochanska, 2018 ; Nigg, 2017 ) and basic psychological sciences (Eisenberg et al., 2019 ) have therefore
sought to integrate di ﬀerent research traditions. Untangling the multitude of terms used in SR
research (e.g., hot vs. cool executive functioning, eﬀ ortful control, attentional control) is beyond
the scope of the present review. Yet, it is worth noting that continued debate about SR conceptual-isation, terminology, and measurement in children limits to some degree the extent to whichresearchers can elucidate typical SR developmental trajectories, and which aspects of SR may be
most responsive to speci ﬁc BCTs.

contextual in ﬂuences on SR, temporal aspects of SR and behaviour change, and relevance of health
goals. These considerations are each brie ﬂy reviewed below, followed by in-depth illustrations of SR
developmental milestones, key inﬂ uences, and ﬁndings linking SR to health across developmental
stages from infancy to adolescence.
Regarding the nature of developmental change, SR processes follow a nonlinear course such that
behavioural control emerges relatively rapidly, whereas cognitive control processes emerge slowly
and steadily over time (illustrated in Figure 1 ). Thus, management of bottom-up impulses is a
primary feature of SR development during the early years, and top-down cognitive control capacitiesbecome more ﬁnely-tuned across adolescence and early adulthood. Development is also hierarchi-
cally organised such that foundational aspects of SR, including rudimentary working memory,
basic attention skills, and impulse control develop early in the lifespan (Diamond, 2013 ; Marcovitch
& Zelazo, 2009 ) and become more automatic, less e ﬀortful, and more closely integrated and coordi-
nated across development.Table 1. Continued.

Note. SR development is not linear. Aspects of SR develop at di ﬀerent rates and are shaped by di ﬀerent in ﬂuences (e.g., individual di ﬀerences in
biology, personality, and experience).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 119
Regarding individual di ﬀerences, temperamental factors such as reward sensitivity, which can be
deﬁned as an individual ’s propensity to detect, enjoy, and seek out positive stimulation, can shape SR
capacity. For example, young children who are highly reward sensitive may have more di ﬃculty with
SR than others when waiting for a treat. Reward sensitivity is also di ﬀerentially salient across devel-
opment and peaks in adolescence, thus can be a key inﬂ uence on SR at this period (Somerville, Jones,
& Casey, 2010 ). Understanding SR capacity of the focal population, and the environmental inﬂ uences
on SR across development, is critical in order to create developmentally-sensitive interventions that
include BCTs. Table 1 illustrates social contexts that help shape SR (e.g., parents; peers) and in which
BCTs may be delivered to enhance SR at di ﬀerent points in development.
Temporal aspects of SR also have implications for BCTs. For example, a developmental perspective
is essential when considering use of BCTs that involve scheduled consequences and rewards or ima-gining future outcomes (Michie et al., 2013 ) because concepts of time emerge with development. For
young children, the future is relatively immediate, whereas older children and adolescents are pro-gressively able to imagine longer time horizons (McCormack & Hoerl, 2008 ). Thus, phrases such as
‘eating vegetables will make you grow big and strong ’(future-oriented, vague) versus ‘eating veg-
etables will give you energy to run in the playground ’(immediate, concrete) may di ﬀer in terms of
their likelihood to motivate behaviour change at di ﬀerent ages. Understanding how children per-
ceive di ﬀerent timescales could result in more e ﬀective BCTs that tailor time-sensitive strategies in
a developmentally-appropriate manner.
Finally, and perhaps most critically when considering SR in relation to health promotion, most chil-
dren and youth do not have articulated health or behaviour change goals. Thus, using BCTs like
strengthening commitment to a health goal in order to promote future health or avoid future
health problems may not be salient for most children unless they have a health concern or condition.Among youth with a chronic illness, better SR is associated with better illness self-management and
regimen adherence; thus BCTs to improve SR may be particularly important for children with ident-
iﬁed health goals (Lansing & Berg, 2014 ; Schwartz & Drotar, 2006 ).
Infancy and Toddlerhood (under 3 years)
SR milestones
Individual di ﬀerences in processes such as focused attention, rhythmicity, and soothability are
present from birth (Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, & Posner, 2011 ). The attentional networks, or neural
systems responsible for alerting and orienting an individual to stimuli, are thought to drive SR
capacity in this early stage. Across the ﬁrst year of life, children rapidly increase in their ability to
self-soothe (Bell & Wolfe, 2004 ) and show early working memory skills such as searching for an
object after a delay (Marcovitch & Zelazo, 2009 ). By the end of the second year of life, children can
more reliably wait for a desired gift and show some capacity to inhibit behavioural impulses
(Carlson, 2005 ). Simpler skills like working memory develop earlier than more complex skills like cog-
nitive ﬂexibility (Diamond, 2013 ; Rothbart et al., 2011 ). The timescale for SR during the ﬁrst 3 years is
also quite short –children this age can tolerate brief delays, but should not be expected to wait for
longer than a few minutes without some external distraction (e.g., toys). Furthermore, it is oftendiﬃcult for toddler-aged children to demonstrate SR under challenging conditions.
Inﬂuences on SR
Individual SR capacity emerges through a process of coregulation with a caregiver; thus, any BCTs to
promote SR during this phase of development must operate through caregiving relationships.
Although the infant or young child contributes to the early caregiving relationship (Bell & Wolfe,2004 ; Samero ﬀ,2010 ), caregivers have primary responsibility for sca ﬀolding the infant ’s ability to
regulate; for example, soothing when upset, feeding when hungry, and providing safe spaces toexplore and to sleep. This relationship helps infants develop their physiological capacity tomanage states of arousal, sleep, and hunger (Paul et al., 2018 ), and lays the groundwork for a120 A. L. MILLER ET AL.
young child ’s later individual SR capacity to regulate emotions, inhibit impulses, and develop execu-
tive attention and planning skills (Bernier, Carlson, & Whipple, 2010 ; Rothbart et al., 2011 ). As children
practice these skills in the context of early caregiving relationships, they learn how to self-regulate on
their own in increasingly sophisticated ways.
BCTs, SR and health promotion
During infancy and early childhood, many health-focused interventions address parents ’develop-
mental expectations and routines such as regular feeding/mealtime and bedtime schedules (Paul
et al., 2018 ). BCTs could also be used to support parents to engage in these behaviours, which can
directly promote child SR through establishing consistent and structured environments and rou-
tines around health, including safety, sleep, and nutrition, and show promise for promoting
healthy growth (Baker, Morawska, & Mitchell, 2019 ; Paul et al., 2018 ). Yet, such interventions do
not typically consider how to support the SR capacity of caregivers to serve as responsive, external
‘regulators ’for the child during infancy. Given known intergenerational transmission of SR
(Bridgett, Burt, Edwards, & Deater-Deckard, 2015 ) and increased recognition of how stress can
reduce parents ’own SR capacity, it is essential to address parents ’SR needs during the early par-
enting years (Crandall, Deater-Deckard, & Riley, 2015 ; Miller, Miller, & Clark, 2018 ). Thus, beyond
promoting consistent sleep and feeding routines to directly support infant SR development,
using BCTs to support parents ’own SR capacity may be an important, yet unexplored indirect
way to enhance child SR at this age through promoting capacity for positive and consistent par-enting (see Table 1 ).
Early childhood (3 –5 years)
SR milestones
Dramatic SR gains are seen in early childhood (Diamond, 2013 ; Marcovitch & Zelazo, 2009 ). Children
can increasingly control impulses, wait longer for desired items, and follow simple instructions(Carlson, 2005 ; Montroy, Bowles, Skibbe, McClelland, & Morrison, 2016 ). They can actively engage
SR strategies to increase attentional focus and regulate emotions when upset (Blair, 2017 ). Emerging
language and perspective-taking skills can also enhance the capacity of preschool-aged children toset-shift, or switch attentional focus in order to generate new solutions (Montroy et al., 2016 ). Such
skills help them engage the ‘building blocks ’of emotion regulation, for example identifying and lab-
elling emotions in themselves and others that allow coping under challenging conditions (Cole,Dennis, Smith-Simon, & Cohen, 2009 ). Indeed, SR skills become critical for children to manage
their own emotions and behaviours and maintain social interactions with their peers.
Inﬂuences on SR
Parents remain a major inﬂ uence on SR throughout the preschool years, and as noted above, parents ’
own SR capacity can shape child SR through management of the home environment, modelling, andprovision of opportunities to practice skills (Baker et al., 2019 ; Bridgett et al., 2015 ; Crandall et al.,
2015 ). Recent work has applied BCTs with parents to promote speci ﬁc behaviours at this age, for
example book reading (Mayer, Kalil, Oreopoulos, & Gallegos, 2019 ), but this has not been attempted
for general SR or health-focused outcomes. Peers also become inﬂ uential in preschool. Interacting
with partners with inconsistent SR may even a ﬀord important practice opportunities that may not
arise when practicing in a more sca ﬀolded manner with a parent or teacher (Durbin, 2018 ). For
example, children can enact SR ‘in vivo ’when engaging with peers (e.g., during con ﬂicts). Peers ’
SR capacities can shape children ’s SR, speci ﬁcally e ﬀortful control across the course of a preschool
year (Neal, Durbin, Gornik, & Lo, 2017 ), and children in classrooms with more free choice, compared
with teacher-led instruction, showed greater gains in inhibitory control skills (Goble & Pianta, 2017 ).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 121
BCTs, SR and health promotion
Child-focused individual BCT strategies involving reattribution (e.g., pretending marshmallows are ﬂuﬀy
clouds in a delay of grati ﬁcation task) may help promote SR skills such as inhibition at this age (Mischel &
Ayduk, 2002 ). Yet, given the salience of the preschool peer context, many SR-focused interventions use
socially-oriented BCTs such as restructuring the preschool environment (Blair & Raver, 2014 ; Raver et al.,
2011 ; Tominey & McClelland, 2011 ). Peer-context interventions, meaning interventions that take place in
a classroom or other peer group setting, have used activities such as mindfulness (Poehlmann-Tynan
et al., 2016 ), yoga (Razza, Bergen-Cico, & Raymond, 2015 ), physical activity (Becker, McClelland, Loprinzi,
&T r o s t , 2014 ), and motor competence (Robinson, Palmer, & Bub, 2016 ) to successfully promote SR.
Observational studies have identi ﬁed associations among individual SR skills and health outcomes, pri-
marily obesity, during early childhood (Caleza, Yañez-Vico, Mendoza, & Iglesias-Linares, 2016). Yet, inter-
ventions that have tested whether improving SR reduces obesity risk have found mixed support
(Brotman et al., 2012 ; Lumeng et al., 2017 ). Unpacking the mechanisms through which early SR
relates to di ﬀerent health behaviours both concurrently and longitudinally is essential as the impact
of early SR interventions on health may emerge over time (Baker et al., 2019 ;E p s t e i n&A n z m a n -
Frasca, 2017 ). Preschool classrooms are a common setting for health-focused programmes that entail
education or peer modelling of speci ﬁc health behaviours (e.g., tasting vegetables), yet with varying
results (Nekitsing, Blundell-Birtill, Cockroft, & Hetherington, 2018 ). Using both individual and peer-
oriented BCTs in classrooms to enhance SR at this age (e.g., self-talk, reattribution, social rewards, restruc-
turing the environment; see Table 1 )m a yb eaw a yt oi n c r e a s ee ﬀectiveness of extant approaches.
Middle childhood
SR milestones
School-aged children ( ∼6–10 years) have increased capacity to manage bottom-up impulses.
Although such abilities may be taxed under demanding conditions, children this age can typically
resist temptation (Duckworth, Gendler, & Gross, 2014 ; Mischel & Ayduk, 2002 ) and have strategies
for managing emotions when frustrated or disappointed (Zeman, Shipman, & Suveg, 2002 ). Children
this age are also developing metacognition, a construct related to SR that includes self-awarenessand self-re ﬂective capacity (Gascoine, Higgins, & Wall, 2017 ). Due to their increased metacognitive
capacity, school-aged children also improve their capacity for top-down SR skills such as planning
and organisation. Such skills are needed for success in the school context (Best, Miller, & Naglieri,
2011 ), due to increased homework demands and other activities that require postponing immediate
gratiﬁcation in order to engage in complex tasks that require focus and attention to detail.
Inﬂuences on SR
Parents continue to model healthy behaviours, but gaining independence is a normative develop-
mental milestone during this period and peer inﬂ uence increases. Related to their increased capacity
for complex cognition, childrens ’self-concept becomes established at this age, and they begin to
compare themselves with peers (Harter, 2006 ). Such skills make it possible to evaluate individual per-
formance relative to others or to one ’s own prior performance (i.e., self-monitor), an important BCT
(Hennessy et al., 2019 ). Middle childhood is also a period of change in social relationships; friendships
move from primarily activity-based (i.e., we are friends because we are both playing basketball rightnow) to more person-based (i.e., we are friends because we have shared history, which may include a
love of basketball) (Newcomb & Bagwell, 1995 ). Such changes shape SR indirectly, as children model
the SR behaviours of peers (DelGiudice, 2018 ); thus BCTs involving social comparisons and conse-
quences may become increasingly relevant (see Table 1 ).
BCTs, SR and health promotion
Children make multiple SR-related decisions on a daily basis; BCTs that help them reﬂ ect on the con-
sequences and success (or failure) of such decisions may enhance their metacognitive skills to inform122 A. L. MILLER ET AL.
future choices, including health-related behaviours. Interventions to enhance SR in school-aged chil-
dren have shown success using individually-focused BCTs such as self-talk and reattribution (Duck-worth et al., 2014 ) and mindfulness training, which involves self-re ﬂection and monitoring
(Mendelson et al., 2010 ; Vickery & Dorjee, 2016 ; Zoogman, Goldberg, Hoyt, & Miller, 2015 ). Meta-ana-
lyses suggest such strategies may be more robust (Hennessy et al., 2019 ; Takacs & Kassai, 2019 ) com-
pared to interventions that use inhibitory control training to increase SR capacity (Chacko et al., 2014 ;
Murray, Theakston, & Wells, 2016 ), Although direct training interventions show some promise, there is
limited transfer to new contexts and few have examined health outcomes. The recent meta-review byHennessy et al. ( 2019 ) found that self-related BCTs, which require capacity for re ﬂection on one’s
actions, for example self-e ﬃcacy to increase a desired behaviour or self-monitoring of behaviours,
emerged as important. As skills to re ﬂect on and monitor one’ s own behaviour typically emerge
across middle childhood into adolescence; such self-related BCTs may become increasingly relevant.
It will be essential, however, that any interventions that involve self-monitoring BCTs in relation to
health outcomes in children also take care to avoid potentially harmful impacts of this type of track-ing, given concerns that such activities may prompt disordered eating and weight control practices,
for example (Simpson & Mazzeo, 2017 ).
Independent health habits that involve SR are becoming established in middle childhood. Chil-
dren with chronic illnesses assume increased responsibility for SR-related health behaviours, suchas remembering to bring their asthma inhalers or stocking their school diabetes kits (Schwartz &
Drotar, 2006 ). Compared with younger children, school-aged children are generally exposed to
more health-relevant SR challenges such as tempting food that is easily acquired or electronic
screens that are constantly present. Yet, unlike adults, they likely have few health-related reasons
or consequences to avoid them, making motivation uniquely challenging. Children this age alsodo not yet have the cognitive capacity to imagine long-term future events, nor how current
actions may relate to future outcomes (Andreoni et al., 2019 ). Thus, BCTs that rely on promoting
focus on the future (e.g., comparative imagining of future outcomes; (Michie et al., 2013 )) may be
less pertinent to this age group, but may be helpful for older children.
Early to later adolescence
SR milestones
Adolescence is characterised by increased capacities in cognitive complexity, and processing speed
nears its peak in late adolescence. Compared with childhood, when impulse control may drive
actions, adolescents ’capacity to set goals, prioritise, and choose among competing options may
be most critical for behaviour change (Steinbeis & Crone, 2016 ). Children this age can also re ﬂect
on speci ﬁc occasions where SR has helped or hindered their success (Tsukayama, Duckworth, &
Kim, 2013 ). Adolescents are able to imagine the possibilities that await them in the future, concep-
tualise their own unique identities (Becht et al., 2016 ), and —to some degree —gain appreciation
that their current actions can shape their future self (Nurra & Oyserman, 2018 ). Yet, adolescence is
also characterised by increased impulsivity, thought to arise in part due to interference from a heigh-
tened reward system (Somerville et al., 2010 ). Thus, adolescence is a striking period of developmental
discontinuity in SR (see Figure 1 ). Adolescents are often seen as lacking in SR because SR related to
impulse control is not enacted when it seems warranted (e.g., substance use, risky sexual behaviour,poor driving decisions). Yet, at the same time, adolescence is also increasingly recognised as a criticaltime for formative learning and motivation around health promotion, which can involve many top-
down SR processes such as planning and problem-solving (Dahl, Allen, Wilbrecht, & Suleiman, 2018 ;
Dorn, Hostinar, Susman, & Pervanidou, 2019 ; Telzer, 2016 ).
Inﬂuences on SR
Adolescence is characterised by the powerful inﬂ uence of peers, although the nature of peer
inﬂuence can change. Younger adolescents (e.g., 13– 15 years) may be concerned with conformity,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 123
whereas older adolescents may move between peer groups as they ‘try out ’and consolidate identi-
ties into emerging adulthood (Kroger, Martinussen, & Marcia, 2010 ). Peers impact adolescents ’
capacities to engage both bottom-up and top-down SR processes under emotionally challenging
conditions (Pfeifer et al., 2011 ). Adolescents ’reward sensitivity and risk-taking behaviours have
been shown to vary as a function of perceived peer presence (Cascio et al., 2015 ; Chein, Albert,
O’Brien, Uckert, & Steinberg, 2011 ). Reward sensitivity may positively impact health behaviours by
enhancing motivation and attention under circumstances that promote prosocial, adaptive (vs.
risky) choices (Telzer, 2016 ). Social context is critically important; the presence of parents can
reduce risk taking, and the presence of peers can enhance it (Dahl et al., 2018 ; Telzer, Ichien, & Qu,
2015 ; van Hoorn, McCormick, Rogers, Ivory, & Telzer, 2018 ). Because adolescents also typically
have larger social networks than younger children, they may be inﬂ uenced by a broader range of
social contexts and identities. Finally, biology is a complicating factor, as pubertal hormones can
shape emotional reactivity and other aspects of SR (Dahl et al., 2018 ). Biology can even alter the
impact of social relationships; for example, it has been shown that the eﬀ ectiveness of maternal
support in stress regulation may be reduced for postpubertal youth (Hostinar, Johnson, & Gunnar,2015 ).
BCTs, SR and health promotion
Adolescents can engage in BCTs that require self-re ﬂection, abstraction, and metacognition such as
comparing future outcomes and relapse prevention (Michie et al., 2013 ). Youth in weight manage-
ment programmes who were encouraged to ‘bring the future to the present ’using episodic future
thinking approaches wherein positive future events are envisioned as a result of behaviour change
reduced their energy intake (Daniel, Said, Stanton, & Epstein, 2015 ), suggesting this may be a prom-
ising approach for individuals with a stated health goal. Yet, whereas adolescents may be competent
in identifying health goals, a key element of many BCTs, they may reject adults ’preferred goals and
health goals may con ﬂict with more pressing priorities or social norms (Draper, Grobler, Mickles ﬁeld,
& Norris, 2015 ). For example, a health goal to bring lunch from home may lose to an immediately
rewarding social goal to eat fast food. Thus, although adolescence is a period of robust health in
many ways, it is also a time of increased risky health behaviours and poor health-related decisionmaking, even among youth managing chronic illness (Lansing & Berg, 2014 ; Wasserman, Hilliard,
Schwartz, & Anderson, 2015 ).
Michie ’s BCT taxonomy highlights the importance of rewards as well as the power of restructuring
the environment in changing health behaviour (Michie et al., 2013 ). Adolescence is a period of social
and environmental changes, heightened emotional intensity and reward focus, and goal ﬂuctuation
(Crone & Dahl, 2012 ). Thus, developmentally-informed BCTs to promote SR and health behaviours in
adolescents will di ﬀer from BCTs used in younger children (Onrust, Otten, Lammers, & Smit, 2016 ). For
example, one study employed a creative use of a BCT to provide information about social conse-quences to harness adolescent passions and promote positive health behaviour. Speci ﬁcally,
researchers tested whether a focus on healthy eating as a social justice rather than a health issue
changed eating choices, and found that adolescents selected food and drink of higher nutritional
quality when they focused on social justice compared with health (Bryan et al., 2016 ). Understanding
how to engage both adolescents ’heightened reward sensitivity and engagement in the broader
social world may be critical to developing BCTs that promote SR and health for this age group(Crone & Dahl, 2012 ; Dahl et al., 2018 ).
Future directions: a suggested roadmap for researchers
Identify developmentally-informed BCTs to promote SR and health outcomes
As noted earlier, Hennessy et al. ’s(2019 ) meta-review of BCTs to promote SR identi ﬁed only two meta-
analyses addressing children and youth, yet developmental di ﬀerences became apparent.124 A. L. MILLER ET AL.
Speciﬁcally, one meta-analysis found that parent modelling was more eﬀ ective for younger children,
whereas self-monitoring with mobile apps was more e ﬀective for adolescents ’diet and exercise
behaviours (Brannon & Cushing, 2014 ). Another meta-analysis found that BCTs using goal setting
and monitoring (e.g., self-control and problem-solving skills training) worked best for substance
use prevention among elementary and early adolescent-aged children, and to some degree forolder adolescents, but that such approaches did not work for adolescents aged 14 –16 years
(Onrust et al., 2016 ). Further, most of the meta-analyses evaluated individual self-related BCTs (e.g.,
monitoring, goal-setting), with few addressing impulse control, stress reduction, or social-contextualfactors (e.g., restructuring environment). Considering the nature of SR development as reviewed here,
it makes sense that behavioural inhibitory control capacity may be more critical for shaping young
childrens ’actions compared with adolescents. Studies also suggest promoting intentional SR can
be di ﬃcult in younger children given their more limited cognitive capacity (Steinbeis & Crone,
2016 ; Steinbeis, Haushofer, Fehr, & Singer, 2014 ). Future health-promotion interventions could there-
fore bene ﬁt from research that identi ﬁes which BCTs are e ﬀective for SR promotion at di ﬀerent ages.
For example, testing whether BCTs that address inhibitory control in younger children have similar
impact to BCTs that promote self-monitoring in older children in relation to the same health goal
could be a direction for future developmentally-informed work. As shown in Table 1 ,d iﬀerent
BCTs are likely best for promoting SR at di ﬀerent ages and in di ﬀerent social contexts; understanding
these nuances is important in informing SR-focused health behaviour interventions in children andyouth.
Experimental medicine approach in behavioural interventions
As limited intervention research in youth has focused on BCTs, we lack data on whether the SR
processes that are hypothesised mechanisms of health behaviour change actually shift in response
to BCTs. This is the goal of the experimental medicine approach, which entails identifying andtesting mechanisms of change in identi ﬁed targets, such as SR (Nielsen et al., 2018 ). Thus, identify-
ing how BCTs can promote SR and in turn health outcomes among children and youth requiresmechanistic, developmentally-informed research to identify which SR processes are responsiveto which BCTs, and testing whether hypothesised changes in SR map to change in health behav-
iour. Such work could use designs such as factorial experiments (Collins, Dziak, Kugler, & Trail, 2014 ;
Miller, Gearhardt, et al., 2018 ) and adaptive trials (Klasnja et al., 2015 ) that can carefully unpack
which speci ﬁc aspects of SR have potential for malleability, using which BCTs, in which settings,
and at what age(s).
Unpacking SR processes
Future work could also examine how SR processes interact in order to develop BCTs that are respon-
sive to di ﬀerent aspects of SR. For example, although impulse control may seem more critical for
reducing reward-driven eating than for sticking to an exercise routine, it may also play a key rolein the latter by reducing the impulse to engage in sedentary behaviour. Yet, the timing and inter-action of such processes are not well-articulated. Further, although bottom-up processes such as
impulse control are typically perceived as needed to be regulated, they can also play a critical role
in regulating: for example, an immediate reaction to an alarming situation can orient our attentionand invoke a top-down SR response, such as removing oneself from the situation. BCTs that act
on multiple SR processes could also be e ﬀective in children, as aspects of SR develop independently
early in development but become increasingly interconnected, such that one aspect of SR may
enhance another (Montroy et al., 2016 ). For example, children who are able to manage their
responses to stress and recover quickly may more readily engage in peer social interactions thatallow them to practice and build advanced regulatory skills such as social perspective taking. In con-trast, a child who struggles with stress regulation or impulse control may experience increasingHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 125
diﬃculties as environments become more complex and present greater SR challenges (e.g., transition
to a new school).
Considering moderators
Future work must also examine factors that moderate the impact of BCTs on SR. Not everyone
requires the same level of SR or BCT support and SR itself may moderate intervention impact
(Hagger et al., 2019 ). Studies have found that SR-focused interventions are more eﬀ ective for children
who are lower in SR to begin with (Blair & Raver, 2014 ; Takacs & Kassai, 2019 ; Tominey & McClelland,
2011 ). Individual di ﬀerences in reward sensitivity are also likely important, and reward sensitivity may
also change with development, as noted above. Eating behaviour research in adults has found thatgaps between intended and actual behaviours are wider among individuals with more disinhibited
eating styles (Reichenberger, Smyth, Kuppens, & Blechert, 2019 ), and impulsive eating moderates
intervention impact in some (Houben, 2011 ), though not all (Chen, Veling, Dijksterhuis, & Holland,
2018 ) studies. Reward sensitivity may peak in adolescence, but it has also been associated with
eating behaviours (De Decker et al., 2016 ) and behaviour problems (Morales et al., 2019 )i n
younger children. Thus, reward sensitivity is likely an important moderator to test across develop-
ment. Of course, as broader social-contextual factors can also moderate intervention impacts, it is
also important to test BCTs among child and youth populations living in underresourced environ-
ments, such as poverty (Blair & Raver, 2014 ).
Measuring SR ‘in the wild ’
Finally, to integrate SR into health behaviour interventions and best understand when and where
BCTs are needed to promote SR, we must more precisely articulate the timescales on which
diﬀerent SR processes interrelate and how they relate to health behaviours. To do so, research
must measure both SR and health behaviours in the ﬁeld (Reichenberger et al., 2019 ). Developmen-
tally, it is important to assess how BCTs may promote SR in contexts that require di ﬀerent SR
demands, such as paying attention in the classroom versus making healthy choices in the lunchroom.As most SR research has been conducted in homogenous, Western populations, resulting in common
assessments being culturally or cohort speci ﬁc (Carlson et al., 2018 ; Lamm et al., 2018 ), future work
must attend not only to developmental concerns (e.g., when do cognitive control strategies emerge?
how can we measure them?), but also the meaning and measurement of SR from a broader socio-
cultural perspective.
Conclusions: BCTs to enhance SR in children and youth
Most SR interventions reviewed here seek to address individual-level change. Individual SR capacity
becomes increasingly inﬂ uential across development, as individuals choose environments that in turn
shape behaviour ( ‘niche-picking ’(Samero ﬀ,2010 )). Yet, individuals exist within social relationships
and contexts that impact the likelihood of individual SR interventions to eﬀ ect change. Developmen-
tally-informed BCTs must operate at multiple levels (see Table 1 ‘social context ’column). Children are
also nested within multiple social-ecologic contexts (see Figure 2 ), with limited autonomy in health-
related routines and decision-making. Even health-speci ﬁc goals related to chronic illness manage-
ment may be chosen by parents or paediatricians and are not ‘owned ’by the child, creating an
inherent motivational challenge (Lansing & Berg, 2014 ; Schwartz & Drotar, 2006 ). Such challenges
become more complicated with development as competing goals arise, creating additional di ﬃcul-
ties in designing developmentally sensitive BCTs. SR-focused interventions in children and youth
therefore must consider not only the developmental stage of an individual child but also the a ﬀor-
dances of developmentally salient social contexts in which an intervention is implemented (Bailey
& Jones, 2019 ). For example, developmentally-informed BCTs could be used to enhance early126 A. L. MILLER ET AL.
childhood SR via parenting routines or by restructuring preschool environments. Formative research
to articulate BCTs that promote SR in relation to health behaviour change is needed in order toaddress complex questions regarding individual motivation for behaviour change in children and
youth, and how to restructure social-ecological environments such that healthier choices are more
appealing. Interventions to promote SR can be implemented at di ﬀerent social-ecologic levels (see
Figure 2 ), from the macro- or exosystem (e.g., tax policies on carbonated soft drinks) to the mesosys-
tem (e.g., family-based weight-loss programmes). Although individual SR strategies are often requiredto manage daily challenges, implementing developmentally sensitive BCTs through strategic contex-tual supports may ultimately reduce the need for SR in order to engage in healthy behaviours (Duck-
worth, Gendler, & Gross, 2016 ). In sum, specifying the developmental timing of SR-focused
interventions and how factors at di ﬀerent contextual levels may facilitate or constrain SR processes
are foundational next steps in using BCTs to foster SR across development and creating SR-informedintervention approaches to promote positive health behaviours for children and youth.
