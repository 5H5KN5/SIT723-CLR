theory

Abstract
Background: Use of theory in implementation of complex interventions is widely recommended. A complex trial
intervention, to enhance self-management support for people with osteoarthritis (OA) in primary care, needed to
be implemented in the Managing Osteoarthritis in Consultations (MOSAICS) trial. One component of the trial
intervention was delivery by general practitioners (GPs) of an enhanced consultation for patients with OA. The aim
of our case study is to describe the systematic selection and use of theory to develop a behaviour change intervention
to implement GP delivery of the enhanced consultation.
Methods: The development of the behaviour change intervention was guided by four theoretical models/frameworks:
i) an implementation of change model to guide overall approach, ii) the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to
identify relevant determinants of change, iii) a model for the selection of behaviour change techniques to address
identified determinants of behaviour change, and iv) the principles of adult learning. Methods and measures to
evaluate impact of the behaviour change intervention were identified.
Results: The behaviour change intervention presented the GPs with a well-defined proposal for change; addressed
seven of the TDF domains ( e.g., knowledge, skills, motivation and goals); incorporated ten behaviour change techniques
(e.g., information provision, skills rehearsal, persuasive communication); and was delivered in workshops that valued the
expertise and professional values of GPs. The workshops used a mixture of interactive and didactic sessions, were
facilitated by opinion leaders, and utilised ‘context-bound communica tion skills training. ’Methods and measures
selected to evaluate the beh aviour change intervention included: appr aisal of satisfaction with workshops, GP
report of intention to practise and an assessment of video -recorded consultations of G Ps with patients with OA.
Conclusions: A stepped approach to the development of a behavio ur change intervention, with the utilisation of
theoretical frameworks to identify determinants of change matched with behaviour change techniques, has enabled a
systematic and theory-driven development of an intervention designed to enhance consultations by GPs for patients
with OA. The success of the behaviour change intervention in practice will be evaluated in the context of the MOSAICS
trial as a whole, and will inform understanding of practice level and patient outcomes in the trial.

Background
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent condition in
general practice, and guidance on its management isavailable [1-6]. Published surveys of current practice
have identified that care is not being delivered as recom-
mended in this guidance, indicating that there is a needto improve and optimise primary care of people with
OA [7-9].
The case study described in this paper was a compo-
nent of the Managing Osteoarthritis in Consultations
(MOSAICS) trial [10], an investigation of the feasibility,
acceptability and impact of implementing the NationalInstitute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) OA
Guideline [2]. The main aim of the MOSAICS study was
to test a complex patient-focused intervention (the ‘trial
intervention ’), developed using the Whole Systems Inform-
ing Self-Management Engagement (WISE) model [11] and
incorporating the three elements of that model: informa-tion for patients, profession al responsiveness to patients ’
needs, and access to care. The three elements in the trial
intervention were: i) an OA Guidebook developed withuser involvement to provide patient-centred and evidence-
based information [12], ii) an enhanced OA consultation
by GPs and practice nurses, and iii) access to a practice-based nurse-led OA clinic (providing an initial 30-minute
appointment and up to three further 20-minute appoint-
ments to provide support for self-management). The inter-vention was an evidence-based service for people who
were 45 years or older presenting to the practice with a
peripheral joint problem (Figure 1), designed to provide:i) relevant written information for patients, ii) support
for patients to undertake muscle strengthening exercises,
increase physical activity and, if applicable, lose weight, andiii) advice to patients on the appropriate use of analgesia.
Its impact is to be evaluated at the level of the practice, for
example prescribing patterns and the recording of clinicalinformation, and at the level of the patient, for example
uptake of NICE recommended treatments and pain.
The Medical Research Council ’s (MRC) updated guid-
ance on the development and evaluation of complex
interventions highlights the need to ensure successfulimplementation of interven tions in research settings,
and that failure to do this can undermine the evaluation
of the intervention being tested [13]. This often requiresa change in clinical practice by those delivering the
intervention, and there is a growing evidence base on
developing, undertaking and e valuating interventions to
effect specific changes in professional behaviour: be-
haviour change interventions [14]. One component of
implementing the MOSAICS trial intervention was toenhance the consultation behaviour of the GPs deliver-
ing the trial intervention. This behaviour concerned
diagnosis and initial management in line with the NICEOA Guideline when patients aged 45 years and over
present with peripheral joint pain. This GP behaviour
was the focus of the case study described here.
The use of theory to inform the development of behav-
iour change interventions is strongly advocated by experts
in the field [15-17] and is often presented as a model orframework. In this paper, we use ‘model ’as shorthand for
a theoretically derived model or framework. Our case
study comprises a description of the systematic selectionand use of models to inform development of a behaviour
change intervention designed to change GP clinical prac-
tice during consultations with patients with OA.
Methods
Four models were selected for their ability to operationalizethe aims of the MOSAICS study in relation to the behav-
iour desired of GPs in the study, and their order of use is
s h o w ni nF i g u r e2 .
The implementation of change model
This model, developed by Grol and Wensing [16], wasselected to inform the overall approach to developing the
behaviour change intervention. It comprises five steps: first
developing a ‘concrete proposal ’for the desired change,
one that is clearly defined a nd easily understandable;
second undertaking an analysis of current practice, and
barriers and incentives for change, in the group inwhich change is desired; third developing and selecting
ways to change practice; and finally (steps 4 and 5)

undertaking and evaluating the implementation plan
(Table 1). Detailed guidance is available on how to
approach the tasks needed for each step with referenceto the underpinning evidence [16], and was selected as,
in addition to its logical approach, it provides guidance
on the answers to three very practical questions duringthe planning of change: ‘where do we want to be? ’(step 1),
‘where are we now? ’(step 2), and ‘how do we get there? ’
(step 3).
The theoretical domains framework
At step 2, a key task was to understand which factors, or‘determinants, ’would impede or facilitate the intended
change, and many psychologically-oriented models have
been proposed to inform this task. Many of these modelsoverlap, and each tends to focus on different aspects of
the change process [16]. One challenge for those facili-
tating change is how to select the most appropriatemodel when undertaking an analysis of these factors in a
particular set of circumstances. Michie et al. addressed
this problem by undertaking a consensus exercise todevelop a model that encompassed 128 theoretical con-
structs (or determinants) included in 33 psychological
theories - the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)[18]. The TDF consists of 12 domains (Table 2), such as
knowledge, skills, beliefs about consequences, motivation
and goals, with each domain having a set of theoreticalconstructs that had been identified as components in
the models included in the consensus exercise. A total
of 11 out of the 12 domains concern characteristics of
the people for whom change is desired, with the 12
th
concerning the attributes of the change or desired be-
haviour itself. The TDF has been used to identify deter-
minants of behaviour change for an extensive range of
conditions and clinical situations, for example, mobilisa-tion of older patients in hospital [19], utilisation of a rule
for the use of CT scans for head trauma [20], and man-
agement of chronic obstructive airways disease [21], andits development and use in a range of other studies has
been reviewed [22]. The TDF has been recently validated
and refined: experts were asked to re-sort the constructsincluded in the TDF and to re-develop the domains,Figure 2 Models used for the development and delivery of the behaviour change intervention.Porcheret et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:42 Page 3 of 11
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/42
with and without reference to the original domains [23].
The refined framework consists of 14 domains, 8 un-
changed from the original, 6 derived from a more specificgrouping of the constructs underpinning 3 of the domains
(beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, and
motivation and goals), with 1 of the original domainsomitted (nature of the behaviour). The 12-domain TDF
model was selected as the domains in this framework
provided a practical and comprehensive list of possibledeterminants of behaviour change (the 14-domain model
had yet to be developed at the time of this study), and the
TDF was utilised to identify relevant determinants of be-haviour change in this study.
Model for mapping behaviour change techniques to the
TDF domains
At step 3, one of our tasks was to develop or select tech-
niques to effect behaviour change. Michie et al. developed
a model to inform the selection of behaviour change tech-
niques that target the determinants described in the TDF
[24]. They identified, and defined, a set of behaviourchange techniques described in the literature and mapped
them to the domains in the TDF described above (barring
the 12
thdomain): the techniques that they judged to be
effective in changing behaviour for each domain [24]. The
approach to mapping behaviour change techniques to
TDF domains has been incorporated into protocols forthe development of complex interventions, for example
for tobacco counselling in dentistry [25] and management
of low back pain [26]. This mapping process provides apractical tool for selecting appropriate behaviour change
techniques as the components of a behaviour change
intervention and was utilised at step 3.
Adult learning theory
At step 3, the principles of adult learning theory were alsoutilised; that adults are inte rnally motivated and self-
directed, bring life experiences and knowledge to learn-
ing experiences, are goal and relevancy oriented, arepractical and like to be respected [27]. Adult learning
theory was selected to inform the educational process of
the behaviour change intervention as it has a well-established role in development of courses to support
continuing professional development [27], including
interventions such as the one developed in this study.

Applying the models
Step 1 –development of a concrete proposal for change
The behaviour change required of the GPs was the de-
livery of an enhanced OA consultation (see Figure 1). A
consensus exercise was unde rtaken with healthcare pro-
fessionals to develop a model for the OA consultation[28]. Subsequent to this, two activities were undertaken.
Firstly, the characteristics of the consensus model OA
consultation were compared with characteristics knownto promote or hinder the implementation of an inno-
vation [16]. Secondly, three general practice advisory
groups were formed –two consisting of GPs with re-
search or teaching roles at Keele University and one
consisting of members of the primary healthcare team
in a local general practice –and meetings arranged. The
meetings were audiotaped and field notes made. The
model OA consultation was presented to the groups
and their views and understanding obtained. From theresults of the comparison and feedback from the ad-
visory groups, the model consultation was refined to
e n h a n c eu p t a k eb yG P s .
Step 2 –analysis of performance, target group and setting
The advisory groups, at the same meetings as arranged
for step 1, were asked about: i) their current manage-
ment of OA, ii) their awareness of, and agreementwith, the NICE OA Guideline, and iii) any gaps per-
ceived between their current practice and that recom-
mended by NICE and in the model consultation. Inaddition, they were asked to suggest which barriers
and/or incentives might be relevant to implementing
the model consultation in practice. Their responses
were mapped by the study team to the domains in the
TDF.
Step 3 –development or selection of strategies and
measures to change practice
There were four phases to the development of the be-
haviour change intervention: defining content, selecting
behaviour change techniques, deciding on style of deliv-
ery, and addressing local practicalities. The content wasd e v e l o p e db yt h es t u d yt e a mi n f o r m e db yt h ev i e w so f
GPs from step 2. The mapping of behaviour change
techniques to TDF domains was utilised to select thetechniques to address domains identified in step 2.
Adult learning principles and Cochrane Effective Prac-
tice and Organisat ion of Care Group ’s reviews [29]
were used to decide on style of delivery. Practical is-
sues, such as venues, timings and duration of meetings,
how best to deliver the behaviour change intervention,and what was feasible in the MOSAICS study, were
addressed by the study team in consultation with gen-
eral practices in the study.Steps 4 and 5 –development, testing and execution of the
implementation plan, and its evaluation
The GP behaviour change intervention was undertaken
as part of the MOSAICS study in practices randomised
to the intervention arm of the study. Methods and mea-
sures were developed to evaluate the behaviour changeintervention at five levels: satisfaction with delivery of
the behaviour change intervention, mediators of change,
self-reported intended behaviour, competency to under-take the behaviour (undertaking the behaviour in a con-
trolled situation [30]), and performance in undertaking
the behaviour in day-to-day practice.
Results
Step 1 –development of a concrete proposal for change
The model OA consultation, developed by the consensus
exercise, consisted of 25 tasks addressing: i) assessment
of chronic joint pain, ii) patient ’s ideas and concerns, iii)
exclusion of red flags, iv) examination, v) provision of
the diagnosis and written information, vi) promotion of
exercise and weight loss, vii) initial pain management,and viii) arrangement of a follow-up appointment [28].
The advisory group meetings were led by one of the au-
thors (MP) and attended by 15 GPs, 5 practice nurses, anda practice manager. The key finding from the meetings on
the characteristics of the model OA consultation was that,
presented as 25 tasks, it was too complex to explain sim-ply and quickly to GPs or for them to easily understand
and translate into day-to-d ay practice. To simplify the
model, tasks were grouped by core elements of a patient-centred consultation [11,31,32], for example support for
self-care and provision of evidence-based information, and
the model succinctly presented as three tasks.
1. To make, give and explain the diagnosis.
2. To provide analgesia advice/prescription.3. To promote and support self-management.
Step 2 –analysis of performance, target group and
setting
The advisory group meeting transcripts and field notes on
current practice, attitudes to recommended best practice,and perceived barriers to, and incentives for, changing
practice, were analysed using the TDF as a coding frame-
work. The analysis was discussed by the study team andby a group of expert educational advisors to the study, and
seven TDF domains were identified as relevant to chan-
ging GP practice in OA consultations (Table 3).
Step 3 –development or selection of strategies and
measures to change practice
The content of the behaviour change intervention was
derived by the study team from the practical requi-
rements of delivering the model OA consultation andPorcheret et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:42 Page 5 of 11
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/42
from gaps identified in the advisory group meetings, for
example lack of knowledge about the impact of OA onthe individual, the skills necessary to deliver the model
OA consultation, and the credibility of NICE guidelines.
The selection of behaviour change techniques wasundertaken by the study team and the educational
advisors to the study. The starting point was the list of
techniques that Michie et al . had judged appropriate to
effect change for domains identified in step 2 [24]. The
group used their research, clinical and educational
experience to decide which of these techniques tochoose. The content of, and techniques to address,
each domain are detailed in Table 4.
The choice of delivery style was informed by evidence
from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of
Care Group on the effectiveness of strategies for changing
practice, with a specific emphasis on small group learningwith a mixture of didactic and interactive sessions [33]
and facilitated by opinion leaders [34]. In addition, the
study team drew on evidence on a learner-centred ap-proach, which utilises prior knowledge and experiences
of the participants [27] to effect change in behaviour.
Specifically, for the delivery of techniques to address the
skills domain, we used empirical evidence on techniques
for training experienced GPs in communication skills, amethod of training known as ‘context-bound communi-
cation skills training ’w a sa d o p t e d[ 3 5 ] .I nt h i st e c h -
nique the ‘context, ’in this case the management of OA,
is in the foreground and the communication training in
the background. A key feature is that participants prac-
tise consultation skills when consulting with simulatedpatients and receive feedback. This had been found to
be a feasible, acceptable and effective method of enhan-
cing the consultation skills o f experienced practitioners
[36] and preferable, for this group, to the approachtaken in undergraduate skills teaching, where it is skill
and not context that is in the foreground.
The final step was to consider the practical issues in
delivering the workshops in four general practices with
all the myriad demands on the GPs ’and other practice
staff ’s time. The final format was developed by the study
team and educational advisors, drawing on their profes-
sional experience, and in consultation with GPs workingin Keele University Medical School. The format was to
deliver the behaviour change intervention at general
practices ’premises, in four sessions, lasting one or two
hours each, and about two to three weeks apart. The
final behaviour change intervention with detailed tim-
ings is shown in Table 5.
Steps 4 and 5 –development, testing and execution of
the implementation plan, and its evaluation
All the GPs, practices nurses, and administrative staff
working in the four practices randomised to the inter-
vention arm of the MOSAICS study, were invited toattend the training sessions (see Table 5 for details)
[10]. The GPs were invited to participate in the evalu-
ation of the behaviour change intervention. Methodsand measures were chosen and developed to evaluate
the behaviour change intervention at the four levels
(Table 6).
Discussion
The utilisation of the Grol and Wensing Implementationof Change Model, the Theoretical Domains Framework,
and the model for mapping behaviour change tech-
niques to the TDF domains have enabled a systematicand theory-driven approach to be taken to the deve-
lopment of an intervention to change clinical practice

evaluate its impact. This proved to be a practical way of
using theory to inform, rather than just inspire, the develop-
ment of a complex intervention, an approach that is widely
advocated but reportedly not always taken [15,38-40].
The Grol and Wensing model did enable us to answer
the three questions ‘where do we want to be? ’,‘where are we
now? ’,a n d ‘how do we get there? ’–a task that is recom-
mended in the MRC guidance on complex interventions:
that researchers can fully describe important components
of the overall intervention and can implement them in theresearch setting [13]. The use of the TDF at step 2, andbehaviour change technique mapping at step 3, enabled
identification of relevant determinants of change in the
GP behaviour component of the main trial, and behav-
iour change techniques to address them, within specifictheoretical frameworks. It also enabled the purpose of
each item of the behaviour change intervention to be
understood, for example information giving to addressgaps in knowledge about OA, rehearsal and feedback to
enhance consultation skills.
In addition to theory, empirical evidence and practical
considerations, on style and mode of delivery, informedTable 4 Content of behaviour change intervention and behaviour change techniques by relevant domains of the

development and ensured that the end product was
evidence-based, feasible to deliver and acceptable to the
recipients.
Use of models to develop behaviour change interventions
in other studies
The TDF and behaviour change technique mapping, de-
veloped by Michie et al ., have both been published
within the last 10 years, and a number of studies have
reported on utility and outcome in the development ofbehaviour change interventions for trials [26,41,42]. Both
models, used sequentially as in this study, have been
employed in development of interventions to improvemanagement of low back pain [26], to enhance GP diag-
nosis of dementia [41], and to reduce antibiotic use for
upper respiratory infections [42]. Two of these have re-sulted in multi-facetted interventions as developed in
this study [26,41], with the other [42] resulting in two
interventions, each specifically addressing one of two de-terminants of behaviour change identified. The research
team in the low back pain study, having determined the
behaviour change techniques to include in the interven-tion, and the mode of delivery, took a pragmatic ap-
proach to their final selection: what was locally feasible
and acceptable. We also took a pragmatic approach ondeciding the final format, but this did not result in any
changes to our intended delivery other than that the
workshops were run at the practices, lasted no morethan two hours each, and were about two to three weeks
apart. To date, only the low back pain trial has reported
and showed a small effect on GP intention to practicebut no significant change in actual behaviour [43]. That
clinical practice was not observed to change may not
have been due to the intervention per se, as there wereTable 5 Workshop schedules to deliver the behaviour

logistical problems in getting GPs to attend the interven-
tion workshops and methodological problems in assessingoutcome. The drive to use theory to inform development
of interventions has been questioned [44], as empirical
evidence is lacking on effectiveness of interventions devel-oped in this way. Although the low back pain trial did not
demonstrate a change in clinical practice, its use of theory
does add to empirical evidence on the process of behav-iour change.
Strengths and possible limitations
Developing complex interventions is a complex task in
itself, and understanding how to approach it in a system-
atic way, informed by relevant theory, can be dauntingfor research teams [13]. The principal strength of the
method described in this paper is that it enabled the
MRC guidance on developing complex interventions tobe operationalized systematically, and in a practical and
do-able manner. The guidance on using the Grol and
Wensing model to change clinical behaviour is extensive[16] and provided a very usable manual on ‘how to do
it.’The use of the TDF strengthens the approach advo-
cated for the Grol and Wensing model for step 2, and isreflected in the increasing popularity of the TDF by re-
search teams in developing interventions [22]. In addition,
the recent validation and refining of the TDF domains hasstrengthened the rationale for its methodology, as used in
this study, and, with a refined structure, strengthened its
use in future studies [23].
The use of GP advisory group meetings both to gain
views about the proposed change (step 1) and to under-
take the target group analysis (step 2) was a practicalstrength. It provided an efficient method of: i) involving
the target group in the development of the change pro-
posal (an activity it its own right that enhances uptake ofan intervention [16]), ii) identifying which characteristics
of the intervention might hinder or facilitate uptake, andiii) understanding current practice and identifying rele-
vant determinants of change.
One potential limitation was that the topic guide for the
advisory group meetings was not specifically developed
from the TDF, which could have resulted in some of the
TDF domains not being fully explored in the meetings.The topic guide had been developed, and the meetings
undertaken, before deciding to use the TDF in step 2.
However, the topic guide was broad and covered currentmanagement, views about recommended practice, and
perceived gaps between current and recommended care
and allowed for free discussion by the groups. This hasoccurred in other studies [21,45] and, although not used
to develop the topic guide, the TDF did give an efficient
method for analysing advisory group comments.
The GPs who attended advisory group meetings were
not the same GPs who received the behaviour change
intervention in the MOSAICS trial, and their views and at-titudes may not have been the same as these GPs. Analysis
of the actual target group for the behaviour change inter-
vention –the GPs in the four MOSAICS intervention
practices –may have identified different determinants to
be addressed, but the timescale for developing the behav-iour change intervention in the MOSAICS study did not
allow for this. However, as the mode of delivery included
interactive sessions, and the sessions encouraged reflectionon current practice and on the video-recorded consulta-
tions, there was ample opportunity for issues specific to
the study GPs to be addressed.
The final measure of success, beyond the fact that this
methodology has provided the framework for an inter-
vention deliverable in practice, is whether it achievedwhat it set out to (a change in clinical practice) in aTable 6 Methods and measures to evaluate the behaviour change intervention

consultation with simulated OA patients were madebefore and twice after (at one and five months after)
the behaviour change intervention.Videos were assessed for the presence of specific
behaviours necessary for the delivery of the model OAconsultation.
Performance in delivering the
model OA consultation.Patient report: patients who attended the MOSAICS
study nurse-led OA clinic were asked to report on thecontent of the previous GP consultation.Four aspects of the consultation, did the GP: elicit ideas
about the problem, give the diagnosis, explain thediagnosis, hand out the guidebook?

sufficient dose to achieve optimal outcomes for patients
in the MOSAICS trial. Both these outcomes (intermedi-
ate professional-focused and ultimate patient-focused)will be reported in the future as part of the main results
from the MOSAICS study.
Conclusion
A stepped approach to the development of a professionally-
focussed behaviour change intervention to implementa component of a trial interv ention, with the utilisation
of theoretical frameworks to identify determinants of
change and match behaviour change techniques tothese, has enabled the systematic and theory-driven de-
velopment of an intervention to enhance the mana-
gement of OA by GPs. The success of the behaviourchange intervention will be evaluated in the context of
the MOSAICS trial, and will i nform the understanding
of practice level and patient outcomes in the trial.
