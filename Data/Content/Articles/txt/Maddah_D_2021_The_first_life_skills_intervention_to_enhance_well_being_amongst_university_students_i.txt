Abstract
Although Life Skills programs showed to improve the psychological and physical wellbeing of individuals, little attention has been paid, worldwide and in the Arab countries in specific to implementing life skills intervention for university students. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a life skills based health promotion intervention KHOTWA (STEP) in enhancing the wellbeing of university students in Lebanon, a country that faces economic and political instability. This is a quasi-experimental study, with pre and post-test, intervention-control design. Each group was formed of 78 participants studying in a private university in Lebanon. Mixed design was used to address the process and outcomes objectives of the intervention. The program was carried online due to COVID-19 pandemic. Significant differences were observed between the intervention and the control groups for life skills, dietary habits and mental health scores at the 3-month follow-up. For the intervention group, a significant increase was observed in the mean score of each of the following Life Skills subscales: self-care (p  = 0.001), work and study (p  = 0.013), career and education planning (p  = 0.011) and looking forward/goal settings 
(p < 0.001). Students also achieved a healthier eating habit compared to those in the control group by decreasing their 
consumption of processed food. There was no significant effect in terms of body mass index (p  = 0.827). Also, there was 
a significant change in the mental health status (p  = 0.012) only in the intervention group as its mean score decreased 
after 3 months of the intervention implementation. This intervention enhances the mental health and promotes healthy 
habits leading consequently to a better quality of life and more productivity amongst university students. Therefore, such interventions should be replicated in other similar context to improve university students’ well-being.

young adults. LS programs have never been implemented 
in the educational system in contexts similar to the Lebanese context. Our results showed the effectiveness of a LS pro-gram in improving university students’ well-being in this context. The results identify practices that are perceived as generally helpful to be scaled up at the national and interna-tional levels.
Introduction
The notion of life skills (LS) has gained momentum over the past few years. The importance of LS continues to receive increasing recognition for their valuable contribu-tion to improving the psychological and physical wellbeing of those who are impacted by multiple social and environ-mental factors (Cronin and Allen, 2017). For instance, Lebanon has been suffering from a corrupted political sys-tem that over the last few years, has led to major social and economic challenges. As a result, the Lebanese people are undergoing financial and educational hardships, such as challenges of enrolling in university, and are highly vulner -
able to mental and physical disorders (Obeid et al., 2020). The high number of Syrian refugees has resulted in increased unemployment rates and xenophobic attitudes amongst Lebanese people (Obeid et al., 2020). Furthermore, more than 50% of the Lebanese population have been con-fronted with traumatic events related to war (Karam et al., 2006); thus suggesting that mental ill-health and poor psy-chological wellbeing may be high within this population. This percentage is expected to further increase due to many factors, including the unstable political situation, high risk of terrorist attacks, lack of clean water, high unemployment rate, electricity shortage and improper waste disposal (World Bank [WB], 2016). The mental and physical health of the Lebanese continue to be at risk, especially that of university students (Zeeni et al., 2018).
As social and living conditions of university students 
globally is more challenging with a complex set of the before mentioned factors that play a role in determining their lifestyle and hence their health status, it is fundamental that they are equipped with LS in order to improve coping mechanisms and to negotiate life’s challenges (Esmaeilinasab et al., 2011). Previous LS intervention programs have been initiated in educational settings, in both developed and developing countries. However, LS programs have never been implemented in the educational system of any Arab country in general, nor in Lebanon in specific.
University settings have a great impact on various aspects 
of students’ lives, including academics, health services, social networks and extracurricular activities. LS encom-pass a broad number of domains, including: teamwork (team building and leadership; goal setting (how to achieve a dream/goal, searching and succeeding in a job); manage-ment skills (time management, stress management, food and nutrition management, money and house management) interpersonal communication (effective communications); problem-solving and decision making (such as conflict reso-lution, and negotiation); emotional, social and leadership skills such as building trust, self esteem, self-motivation, positive thinking, volunteering and collective strengths and self-care) (Cronin and Allen, 2017). It has previously been shown that LS curricula play a pivotal role in the promotion of positive transition-related health outcomes amongst youth (Alwell and Cobb, 2009). LS are regarded as one of the most crucial interventions as they enhance youth quality of life, educational attainment and future economic prosper -
ity (Bailey et al., 2009). For instance, Shek and Sun (2012) found that the implementation of a leadership intervention (interventions that influence participants’ behaviours and attitudes towards adopting healthy decisions and practices (Ipsen et al., 2018)), amongst university students, resulted in the adoption of healthy behaviours and improved psycho-logical well-being. Similarly, Savoji and Ganji (2013) dem-onstrated that a life skills training (LST) program is effective in enhancing university students’ mental health. Whilst uni-versities are responsible for promoting the well-being and quality of life of its students, there is a clear scarcity in the literature regarding life skills interventions tackling univer -
sity students especially in developing contexts (Savoji and Ganji, 2013).
Successful interventions can be transferred across multi-
ple campuses with the aim of reaching a high number of the target audience (Mowbray et al., 2006). Previous LS pro-grams pertaining to mental health have been found to have the greatest impact amongst high school students; decreas-ing substance abuse, smoking and alcohol intake; while increasing healthy habits and self-esteem. These programs used a model of health (physical, emotional and social health) to design their curriculum (Bharath and Kumar, 2008). In other words, the implementation of LS programs focusing on mental models, self-care and effective commu-nications and interpersonal skills, nutrition, housing, money, goal settings and self-esteem tackling schools’ stu-dents mental health and substance abuse lead to positive mental and physical outcomes including the significant decrease in negative coping behaviours (Botvin et al., 2001; Meng et al., 2018; Menrath et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2012; Vicary et al., 2004; Weichold and Blumenthal, 2016). Furthermore, such programs have been shown to increase health knowledge and attitudes, assertiveness, self-control, confidence and satisfaction; and a reduction in social anxi-ety amongst pupils (Weichold and Blumenthal, 2016). UNICEF conducted a review of country documentation on LS evaluation from its 40 country offices to assess the rel-evance, coverage, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainabil-ity of LS initiatives (UNICEF, 2012). Results indicated that although the LS program became imbedded in some national education systems; academic institutions tend to squeeze it into the curriculum, without paying the topic full attention.
Maddah et al. 3
The societal conditions in Lebanon place young adults, 
who are attending university to ultimately enter the work 
force and establish their own productive adult lives, at risk of a variety of negative outcomes – including negative physical and mental outcome. Therefore, the implementa-tion of a LS intervention in Lebanese universities, and within the wider educational system is a necessity to increase students’ abilities to physically and emotionally navigate the challenging Lebanese social, economic, politi-cal and natural environments.
A study conducted by Musharrafieh et al. (2008) showed 
that the low prevalence of physical exercise amongst Lebanese university students, which is leading to an increase in obesity and sedentary life, should be addressed by designing life skill-based interventions. Nonetheless, in Lebanon, there is an absence of university-based interven-tions related to physical and mental health (Zeeni et al., 2018). In fact, most of the LS programs that are related to people’s mental health are tailored and limited to refugees. For example, the Adolescents Health and Life Skills Education program educated young refugees about health and LS to improve their mental health and develop their professional skills (Medical Aid for Palestinians, 2018). Thus, an appropriate health promotion strategy is needed to address Lebanese young adults’ lifestyle behaviours, including their physical activity and dietary intake to reduce obesity and its physical and psychosocial comorbidities (Habib-Mourad and Ghandour, 2015; Musharrafieh et al., 2008; Salameh et al., 2014).
Given the little attention that has been paid to imple-
menting Life Skills programs at university levels in addi-tion to the scarcity in such programs in context of developing countries such Lebanon, this study aims to test the effec-tiveness of a life skills based intervention in enhancing the body mass index and mental health amongst Lebanese uni-versity students, the ‘Khotwa’ (step) program. The authors developed this intervention based on the ecological model to address the seven competencies mentioned by the Casey Family Programs (CLS, 2012); Daily Living, Self-Care, Relationships and Communication, Housing and Money Management, Work and Study, Career and Education Planning, Looking Forward. It is a planning approach that aims at creating and maintaining healthy lifestyles and con-ditions through the development of knowledge, attitudes and especially skills using a variety of learning experi-ences, with emphasis on participatory methods. The inter -
vention was theory-based, and innovative for the context of the Arab countries.
We assessed the effectiveness of this intervention, by 
evaluating the extent to which its process and outcome 
objectives are met.
Outcome objectives:
  Enhance LS, mental health, Body Mass Index 
(BMI) and dietary habits amongst at least 80% of the participants.Process objective:
  Ensure that at least 80% of the participants are satis-fied with the sessions’ content and delivery.
  Ensure that the trainers are satisfied with the flow and objectives of the sessions.
Methods
Procedure and intervention design
This is a quasi-experimental study with pre and post-test 
design with a control group. It was piloted in one private university that has five branches located in different areas in Lebanon. Students enrolled in this university mainly came from low to medium socioeconomic levels. The sam-ple size was calculated using G-Power software that indi-cated the minimal sample size to be 80 participants in each arm.
To have an effective LS program for this study, the inter -
vention was aligned with the International Youth Foundation (IYF) minimal standards (IYF, 2013). Also, its modules were adopted from SAWA for Development and Aids LS curriculum (SAWA, 2020), as well as the Boston University LS program (Helfrich, 2011). The duration of the training reached 60 hours. The trainers were qualified since they 
were selected based on their experience in designing and implementing LS programs amongst vulnerable communi-ties. The program has been monitored and evaluated through tackling the process objectives using log sheet, ses-sions’ evaluations by the trainers and trainees, and the impact objectives using quantitative (self-administered sur -
vey) and qualitative (focus group discussions) approaches before and directly after the interventions’ implementation (IYF, 2013). This mixed method approach helped to trian-gulate results.
Intervention and control groups
Intervention model. A total of 20 online training sessions, 
with a duration of 3 hours each, for a period of 10 weeks, 
was provided to the intervention groups. These sessions addressed the proximal level of the ecological system tar-geting the behaviour, attitude and knowledge of the indi-vidual as well as more distal macro-system, such as the interaction of the individual with his peers. Also some aspects of the effect of policies in students’ decisions and behaviours were addressed (Bronfenbrenner,1977, 2001, 2005). The first session was about introducing the program to students and highlighting the importance of LS. Each one of the subsequent 19 sessions covered one life skill. To reinforce the knowledge that students acquired throughout the session, individual and group-based assignments were given to students, all the sessions’ learning objectives were designed to cover Casey seven competencies (see Table 1). In the first session, four focus groups were conducted with 
4 Health Psychology Open 
some students to have a better understanding of the view of 
youth regarding LS and its impact on their health. In the last session, students shared a personal story about how the Khotwa program impacted them, taking into consideration the proximal and distal ecological factors, and provided feedback about their participation in the program. Also, the trainers submitted a summary highlighting the impact of LS on participants’ mental health and dietary habits.
Participants. Khotwa program was offered as an elective 
academic course: Life Skills for Youth, announced on the 
university management system, where 78 students were voluntary enrolled in it. An email was sent by the regis-trar office for students who did not take the course to ask them to participate in the study as a control group. Eligi-ble participants needed to have the following characteris-tics: full time students, living in Lebanon in the last 5 years, coming from low- to medium socio-economic 
level (< 3000,000 LL per month = $750 per month), 
receiving financial aid, never participated in any previous 
LS training or workshop; willing to complete mental 
health, dietary habit and LS assessments (pre and post-intervention); and were aged between 18 and 30 years 
old, majoring in any faculty/school, and both males and females can participate. The control group, which con-sisted of 78 students who chose not to take the LS course, were asked to fill in the self-administered survey twice with a 3-month difference. A registered nutritionist at the university provided participants with a free body mass composition test and some nutritional advice, as an incen-tive to participation. Participants in the control group were not in a direct contact with each other, as it was an online training due to covid-19 preventive measures. This minimized the contamination bias.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
Modern University for Business and Sciences (MUBS). A written consent form was obtained from both the interven-tion and control groups which clearly explained the scope of the study to both groups in terms of number of sessions, objectives and forms of evaluation. Any student who did not meet the criteria could enroll in the course but s/he could not participate in the study.
Instruments
Quantitative aspect
A.  A self-administered Arabic questionnaire: It was 
used to assess participants’ LS, internalising mental health disorders of anxiety and depression, dietary habits and their BMI. The scales used are the following:
BMI. Corrected BMI was calculated using standardized and 
calibrated scales by Salameh et al. (2014). Corrected BMI ameliorates socially desirable responses. The equations are: for males corrected weight = (1.003 × reported weight) and 
corrected height = (0.959 ×  reported height) +  7.59 and for 
females corrected weight = (0.942 ×  reported weight) +  3.14 
and corrected height = (0.943 ×  reported height) +  9.42. 
Therefore, the corrected body mass index (BMI) was calcu-lated as follows: corrected weight in kg/corrected (h )
2 (in m). 
Based on the World Health Organization (WHO, 2003) clas-sification, BMI values were classified into four categories Table 1. Life skills (LS) topics covered by Khotwa program, delivered to the intervention group.

(BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), 
overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2) and obese (⩾ 30 kg/m2).
Smoking. The frequency of smoking was measured by ask-
ing participants to indicate whether they smoked cigarettes, 
hookah or both, and, if so, how frequently they smoke per week. Those who smoke both are referred to as Mixed Smokers.
Life skills (LS) questionnaire. Following WHO guidelines, the 
Casey Life Skills questionnaire (CLS, 2012) was employed 
in the present study with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.95, which represents an excellent internal consistency. The CLS has the following subscales: daily living (17 items related to meal planning and preparation, cleaning and food storage, home maintenance and computer and internet basics), self-care (17 items including healthy physical and emotional development, such as personal hygiene, taking care of one’s mental and physical health and contraception use), relation-ships and communication (18 items assessing developing and sustaining healthy relationships, cultural competency and self-expression), housing and money management (23 items assessed banking and credit, finding and keeping affordable housing, budgeting and living within one’s means), work and study (20 items assessed employment; understanding of contracts and legal matters; and study skills), career and education planning (nine items assessed career path and choice of discipline in postsecondary edu-cation), looking forward (eight items assessed level of con-fidence and internal feelings important to their success). Responses were calculated by summing up the answers for each subscale, the questions were on a likert scale ranging from 1 = No, 2 = Mostly No, 3 = Somewhat, 4 = Mostly Yes and 5 = Yes.
Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). FFQ comprised 18 semi-
quantitative questions measuring the five basic food catego-ries typically consumed by Lebanese. FFQ used in this study was adapted from a questionnaire validated in Leba-non by Salameh et al. (2014). Participants indicated how often each food item was usually consumed with four pos-sible answers for each of the food categories: (1) never, (2) once or twice per week, (3) three to six times per week and (4) daily consumption.
Mental health status. The Arab Youth Mental Health Scale 
(AYMH), a 21-item scale developed and validated by Mak-
houl et al. (2011), in Lebanon, was employed in the present study to measure internalising mental health disorders of anxiety and depression as a single scale. AYMH is an epide-miological measure, not a diagnostic one, rated on a 3-point scale from always, sometimes, to rarely. Cronbach’s alpha in the present study was 0.80.B.  Sessions’ evaluation: Exit slips for sessions’ evalu-ation consisted of three questions with 7-point likert scale, related to the participants’ satisfaction in terms of content and facilitation, with a space to add any feedback.
Qualitative aspect
A. Focus Group Discussions: The interview guide used 
in conducting the focus group discussions consisted of different types of questions. Some of them addressed the participants’ behaviours, such as ‘what are their perceptions towards engaging in an unhealthy 
behavior’, ‘whether it is a priority for the participants 
to choose certain healthy behaviours’ and ‘the bene-
fits and disadvantages of engaging in that behaviour by sharing their experiences’. Other questions were related to their LS, like ‘their weaknesses and strengths in regards to their LS’, ‘whether they per -
ceive LS as factors influencing their health’ and ‘share incidents where a gap in any LS was a barrier to achieve certain goals’. Moreover, students were asked questions related to the designing of the intervention, such as ‘what motivates youth to be a part of an inter -
vention program’ and ‘in what way the effectiveness of a LS intervention program might be enhanced’. The same questions were asked to the same focus groups right after the completion of the intervention.
B.  Trainers’ evaluation of students’ engagement: Log sheets were collected from the trainers regarding their evaluation of each session in terms of students’ attendance, sessions’ objectives and timing.
C.  Trainers’ evaluation of the sessions’ content: Meetings with the trainers regarding their feedback on the learning objectives and activities conducted during the sessions.
Analysis
Quantitative data statistical analysis
Outcome analysis. Using SPSS (version 22.0), a paired sam-
ple t-test was used to examine the mental health, LS and 
BMI score changes before and after the intervention. For 
multivariable analysis, repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine the effect of LS training on the mental health, BMI and dietary habits of the participants, after adjusting for basic sociodemographic characteristics. The significance level in all the tests was set at p < 0.05.
Process analysis. A descriptive analysis addressing the ses-
sions’ evaluation (exit slips) was conducted, and log sheets were summarized to highlight the absence rate of the students.

Results
Demographics
The sample of this study consisted of 156 students attend-
ing a private university in Lebanon. The participants were evenly distributed amongst control and intervention groups (n = 78). At baseline, the two groups had almost the same 
demographic, mental health, life skills and health behav-iour characteristics with no statistically significant differ -
ences shown (Table 2) using General Linear Modelling.
Intervention group description
Amongst 78 students, 15% were freshmen (first year), 18% were sophomore (second year), 52% were junior (third year), 7% were senior (fourth year) and the remaining were either a master or Ph.D. student (see Table 2). The sample contained more females (81%) than males (19%) and had a mean age of approximately 21 years old. On weekdays, the 
majority of participants (73%) stated that they sleep from 5 to 8 hours per day, 13% sleep <5 hours a day, and the rest 
sleep more than 8 hours per day. In the weekend, approxi-
mately half of the participants (52%) claimed that they sleep from 5 to 8 hours per day, 37% of them sleep >8 hours, 
and the remaining sleep <5 hours a day. Additionally, most 
of the students (76%) succeeded in attaining normal weight status, and only a few students had an abnormal weight sta-tus: 8% underweight, 8% overweight and 8% obese. Also, the dietary intake of the intervention group was similar to that in the control group. Finally, 18% of the sample had mental health problems.
Control group description
The sample consisted mainly by juniors/third year (48%), followed by freshmen/first year (20%) and sophomore/sec-ond year (19%), with smaller proportion of senior/fourth year (5%) and master or PhD students (8%). Most of the participants were female, and only 22% were male. The students had a mean age of approximately 21 years old. On 
weekdays, 80% of participants indicated that they sleep from 5 to 8 hours per day, 12% sleep <5 hours a day and the 
rest sleep >8 hours per day. In the weekend, more than half of the participants (62%) claimed that they sleep from 5 to 8 hours per day, 29% of students sleep >8 hours and the 
remaining sleep <5 hours a day. Also, only 31% are above 
recommended weight guidelines whereby 11% were obese, 10% were overweight and 10% were underweight. Finally, 21% of the sample had mental health disturbance.
Process evaluation
Although the percentage of students’ attendance in the first two sessions was below 90% due to the add and drop period, it gradually increased and ranged between 90% and 100% throughout the remaining sessions. The latter indicates that the trainers of the course succeeded in keeping the students involved and excited to attend the next sessions and that the content of each session was important and interesting. For instance, the students were, on average, 92% satisfied with the trainers’ performance and 89% satisfied with the content of each session (Figure 1). Overall, the objectives of each session have been met as the participants claimed that they benefited from the course and gained valuable knowledge about these precious real-LS. The only concern was that stu-dents wanted more practice and case studies related to the content of each session. However, if this training was imple-mented in regular classes, this issue will be solved as the trainers will have more control over the session’s time.
Outcome evaluation
Life skills (LS). The intervention and control groups differed 
significantly in terms of self-care (t[78] = −6.27, p < 0.001), 
housing and money management (t[78] = −3.27, p = 0.002) 
and looking forward subscales (t[78] = −2.73, p = 0.008); 
however, no significant impact was seen on the following LS subscales: daily living (t[78] = 0.02, p = 0.982), relation-
ships and communication (t[78] = 1.12, p = 0.266), work 
and study (t[78] = −1.67, p = 0.1) and career and education 
planning (t[78] = −0.76, p = 0.449) (see Table 3). Overall, 
the mean score for each of the LS subscales, except for daily living and relationships and communication sub-scales, increased in the intervention group. Oppositely, in the control group, the mean score decreased for almost all LS, except for daily living, housing and money manage-ment and looking forward/goal settings. In other words, participants in the intervention group demonstrated sub-stantial performance improvement in almost all the LS compared to those in the control group.
Dietary intake and BMI. Even though the intervention did 
not insignificantly change high calorie intake (t[78] = 0.26, 
p = 0.791), and hot beverages intake (t[78] = 0.07, p = 0.944), 
it significantly decreased low calorie intake (t[78] = 1.97, p = 0.05) and processed food intake (t[78] = 2.21, p = 0.03) 
(see Table 3). In other words, students in the intervention group achieved a healthier eating habit compared to those

in the control group by significantly decreasing their con-
sumption of processed food. There was, however, no sig-nificant effect in terms of body mass index (t[78] = 0.22, p = 0.827) (see Table 3).
Mental health status. Significant positive impacts were 
observed on students’ mental health status (t[78] = 2.72, 
p = 0.008) (see Table 3). The mean score for the interven-
tion group decreased, while the mean score for the control group increased. Hence, students in the intervention group succeeded in building better mental well-being as com-pared to those in the control group.

Life skills (LS). At the baseline, there was a significant dif-
ference in the mean score, adjusted by gender, university year and region, between the intervention and the control 
group in terms of the following LS subscales: daily living (p = 0.003), self-care (p = 0.044) and housing and money 
management (p < 0.001) (see Table 4). After 3 months, this 
significant difference of the mean scores between the two groups, with a mean higher after the intervention, in regards to the three abovementioned LS subscales remained, and an additional significant difference appeared in terms of the mean scores of work and study (p = 0.008) and looking for-
ward (p < 0.001) LS subscales (see Table 4). Hence, stu-
dents who enrolled in this intervention showed significant performance enhancement in each of the following LS: daily living, self-care, housing and money management, 
work and study and looking forward in comparison to those in the control group.
Also, for the intervention group, a significant change was 
observed in the mean score of each of the following LS sub-
scales: self-care (p  = 0.001), work and study (p  = 0.013), Table 3. Pre-post paired t-test results.

career and education planning (p  = 0.011) and looking for -
ward (p  < 0.001). The mean score of each of those LS 
increased (see Table 4). Thus, the intervention enhanced self-
care, work and study, career and education planning and looking forward subscales for students in the intervention group. Finally, there was non-significant difference in the mean score of the control group’s LS subscales over time.
Dietary intake. At the baseline, no significant difference in 
the intake of low-calorie food, processed food, high-calorie 
food and hot beverages with p  values are p  = 0.679, 0.943, 
0.736, 0.783 respectively was observed between the mean scores, adjusted by gender (p  = 0.679), university year 
(p = 0.943) and region (p  = 0.736), of the intervention and the 
control groups in terms of all the components of dietary intake (see Table 4). However, over time, there was a signifi-cant difference between the mean scores of both groups, with the mean lower after the intervention, in terms of processed food (p  = 0.002) and high-calorie intakes (p  < 0.001). Hence, 
the intervention promotes a healthier lifestyle for students of the intervention group in comparison to the control groups, as it encouraged the intervention’s participants to decrease their consumption of processed food and high-calorie intake.
Regarding the control group, a significant change was 
observed after 3 months in the mean score of each of the 
following components of dietary intake: hot beverages (p < 0.001) and high calorie (p < 0.001). Thus, the control group decreased their consumption of high calorie (mean score decreased) while increased their hot beverage intake (mean score increased). However, for the intervention group, there was an insignificant difference between its mean score before and after implementing the intervention in the intake of low-calorie food, processed food, high-cal-orie food and hot beverages with p values are p = 0.964, 0.510, 0.578, 0.891 respectively.
BMI. There was no significant change between the mean 
scores, adjusted by gender, university year and region, of 
the intervention and the control groups (p = 0.963), as, after 3 months, the mean score of the intervention group is some-
how equal to the mean score of the control group (see Table 
4). Thus, the intervention did not affect the body mass 
index and the weights of the students in the intervention group. Moreover, a non-significant change (p = 0.089) was noted in the mean score of the intervention group’s BMI before and after implementing the intervention. However, for the control group, a significant difference was observed (p = 0.026), as its mean score increased (see Table 4). Thus, 
the students in the control group gained extra weight after 3 months.

disorders of anxiety and depression scores (see Table 4). 
However, after 3 months, there was a significant difference 
between the mean scores, adjusted by gender, university year and region, of both groups (p < 0.001), with the mean 
lower after the intervention (see Table 4). In other words, over time, the intervention group showed notable perfor -
mance improvement in terms of mental health status com-pared to the control group. Thus, the intervention in which university students participated played a pivotal role in enhancing their mental health status.
Also, for the intervention group, there was a significant 
change (p = 0.012) in the mental health status, as its mean 
score decreased after 3 months of implementing the inter -
vention. Hence, the intervention improved the mental health status of the intervention group’s students. However, no significant difference (p = 0.707) was observed in the 
mean score of the control group after 3 months.
Focus group discussions
Based on the interview guide used for the focus group dis-cussions at the baseline and after the intervention, three main themes were identified.
Unhealthy behaviour: Knowledge and practices. At the base-
line, participants defined an unhealthy behaviour as any 
behaviour that might put an individual at risk for physical damage. Only a few students linked their behaviours to their mental health status. The most common risky behav-iours that were mentioned during the focus groups include smoking (Shisha in specific), an unhealthy diet and a sed-entary lifestyle. Students claimed that such behaviours are due to the lack of time, or exercise or laziness to prepare food. Regarding smoking, participants indicated that they usually smoke when they are in groups or influenced by their peers. Besides, some participants claimed that they feel satisfied when they eat high-calorie food or when they go out with their friends to smoke Shisha. For example, a female student who is 23 years old stated that ‘junk food 
and shisha make me happy and satisfied’. When partici-pants were asked about giving examples of the negative consequences of unhealthy behaviours, the majority answered obesity, stress and financial issues. For instance, they spent money on an ad hoc manner on food and unnec-essary items.
The perceptions of participants in the focus groups have 
changed after the intervention as they became more knowl-edgeable about new types of risky and unhealthy behav-iours, such as unprotected sex, dangerous relationships, lack of self-care and lack of budget management. Also, they were able to link these behaviours to mental and bio-logical health while addressing all the ecological factors that contribute to human wellbeing, such as families, friends and the environment itself. Although participants mentioned that they are still engaged in some unhealthy behaviours, such as eating junk food or drive fast, they indicated that they are now more aware of the financial and social burden of diseases. They are more confident to move towards a healthier lifestyle as they have the essential skills needed. For example, a male student who is 23 years old 
emphasized that ‘this course is an important step towards a better understanding of our body and our mind’. The course had positive impacts not only on students but also on their families as some of the students’ mothers attended some of the sessions, especially those related to house, food, money management and self-care.
Life skills (LS) and health. Questions related to participants’ 
LS were addressed by asking them to define LS and to dis-
cuss their weaknesses and strengths in regard to these skills. At the baseline, students had an unclear or incomplete defi-nition of LS, as the majority mentioned only communica-tion skills. Also, there was a lack of knowledge regarding healthy behaviours, such as self-care, and food security and safety and regarding good management in terms of money, house, career and study plans. Besides, they were unable to link their challenges and failures to some LS gaps. How-ever, after the intervention, students defined LS correctly. They have mentioned all the life skills dimensions com-piled with examples for each dimension. Additionally, they were able to link LS with their physical and mental health and to share incidents related to a gap in their LS that lead them to a challenging experience. For instance, one student mentioned that ‘I passed through a very critical situation at home due to my brother’s illness, I was able to cope by building trust with my family members and mitigating the negative consequences through applying my money and house managements skills, this helped me to overcome my challenges’.
Intervention: Suggestions and feedback. At the baseline, stu-
dents were asked questions related to the designing of the 
intervention, such as ‘what motivates youth to be part of an intervention program’ and ‘in what way the effectiveness of a LS intervention program might be enhanced’. Partici-pants mentioned the lack of time as the main reason that prevents them from participating in interventions or work-shops as they have classes or part-time work. Also, they claimed that they might attend any training that provides them with certificates to be added to their professional pro-files. After offering the intervention as an elective course, students have enrolled and the number of attendees was maintained throughout the whole sessions. Students’ feed-back was described in the process analysis section where they showed a high level of satisfaction. For example, a female student who is 27 years old mentioned that ‘this 
course touches our daily life behaviour, it teaches us how to link what we do with who we are, it gives us the platform to reflect on our behaviours and adjust them accordingly’. In summary, due to the success of the program, students have requested an extension of the course to discuss more topics and more case studies.

Discussion
The current study investigated the effectiveness of a LS 
intervention in promoting a healthy lifestyle and improving mental health status for university students. Overall, the results of this study show that LS training is an efficient approach to improve the life skills healthy lifestyle habits and mental health of university students. In fact, students who received the training intervention had a noticeable improvement in almost all the variables. The analysis of 3-month follow-up data provided robust evidence of the effectiveness of such online training. Therefore, the current study confirms the literature with regards to enhancing stu-dents’ mental and physical health and contributes new find-ings. To our knowledge, it is the first study to implement and evaluate a health promotion life skills intervention in the Arab World and in Lebanon in specific. Furthermore, this study added to the literature since little attention has been paid on exploring the effectiveness of life skills inter -
vention at university level (Savoji and Ganji, 2013).
Internalising mental health disorders of anxiety 
and depression
Although studies showed that university students will have 
a better self-esteem and more ability to regulate negative emotions than in their adolescence; they also found that under conditions of low socioeconomic level and history of adverse experiences, like the Lebanese context, this transi-tion phase can become a critical period resulting in an increase in psychological distress (Grant and Potenza, 2010; Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010; Schwartz et al., 2011). Similar to the results of Savoji and Ganji’s (2013) study, this analysis proves the positive effects of LS intervention on the mental health status of university students. The LS program adopted in this study integrated mental models, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, positive thinking and conflict resolutions in addition to dif-ferent kinds of management skills; all these themes are usu-ally used by university counselors through adopting the brief psychodynamic model that proved to enhance stu-dents’ self-satisfaction and decrease their internalising behaviours of anxiety and depression (Riva Crugnola et al., 2020). Hence, similar to other studies, Khotwa intervention proved its potential in enhancing students’ abilities to cope with those challenging situations happening in Lebanon, increasing their level of self-esteem (Esmaeilinasab et al., 2011; Pradeep et al., 2019) and decreasing their level of stress about finding a job by guiding them on how to search for a job and the adequate techniques to be prepared for the labour market. For instance, after 3 months of implement-
ing the training, participants had superior feelings about themselves, less personal problems and a strong ability to build healthier mental well-being, as compared to students who did not participate in the program. Thus, LS training plays a potent role in causing a significant positive transformation in terms of participants’ mental health status by promoting stress management and positive thinking skills (Irannezhad, 2017; Spaeth et al., 2010).
BMI
Although analysis’ outcomes revealed that this training did not impact the body mass index of the intervention group, participants succeed in keeping the same weight even after 3 months of training. Interestingly, control 
group participants have a higher BMI score after 3 months, 
this might be explained by the absence of techniques/skills to maintain healthy lifestyle. Hence, the implemen-tation of such intervention that encompasses sessions related to healthy eating and lifestyle promotion, such as food and nutrition management, is necessary for univer -
sity students (Sabbah et al., 2013). As acknowledged by Bhushan et al., (2018) and Ferland et al. (2015), interven-tions that address LS have the potential to embrace posi-tive changes in individuals’ lives, especially those related to obesity prevention.
Dietary intake
All tests used in the analysis part acknowledged that pro-cessed food consumption was decreased by the students who enrolled in the online training. Hence, similar to Lillehoj et al. (2004) study, the findings emphasized that the intervention promoted healthier eating habits by per -
suading participants to adopt a healthy lifestyle. In other words, building LS intervention that includes sessions related to healthy diet and lifestyle, such as food and nutri-tion management, is a key to improve health behaviours of university students, like decreasing their consumption of unhealthy diets and increasing their physical activities (Ferland et al., 2015; Meng et al., 2018). Also, the results of the dietary intake of the control group support and empha-size our findings. For instance, students in the control group increased their consumption of unhealthy food as they did not participate in the training.
Life skills (LS)
The results in the analysis part were not consistent in terms of LS subscales, as they differ slightly. The paired t -test 
indicated that housing and money management, looking for -
ward and self-care skills of participants had improved after the intervention. However, when comparing the mean score of the control and the intervention groups, the results revealed that work, and study, and looking forward skills of students in the intervention group had enhanced. While, when comparing the intervention group’s mean score before and after the intervention, results showed that self-care, work and study, career and education planning and looking forward skills had improved after the intervention. As 
12 Health Psychology Open 
claimed by Papacharisis et al. (2005), students who enrolled 
in life skill-based intervention showed significant perfor -
mance enhancement in many LS subscales, including look-ing forward, work and study and self-care. In other words, such intervention succeeded in preparing participants for the labour market, equipping them with self-care skills to pro-mote primary prevention, developing their decision-making and problem-solving skills to study or work effectively, ena-bling them to create a new strategy for goal setting and vision and, finally, teaching them how to manage efficiently their money (Cronin et al., 2018; O’Hearn and Gatz, 1999; Papacharisis et al., 2005; Shek and Sun, 2012).
Limitations
The intervention was supposed to be given in person, but 
due to political reasons (Oct 17th revolution) and COVID-19 lockdown, we switched into online sessions which was received positively by the participants. The online format can enhance the replicability and scalability of the program to reach higher number of students at low cost and make it accessible to everyone. However, This LS program can be improved in several ways. First, Khotwa was conducted with students enrolled in a private university, with low to medium socio-economic background; therefore, we couldn’t study the effect of such intervention on students who are enrolled in a public university, or students with a high socio-economic level. Second, we might have the possibil-ity of selection bias related to self-selection of students to the course; it might be that students who are in the control group felt confident enough not to take the course, while the intervention group thought they needed it. However, the deterioration of the outcome measures in the control group over the course of the intervention points to a minimal role of self-selection in this regard. Finally, despite the fact that a registered psychologist was monitoring the process of the whole program, we were not able to conduct a psychologi-cal clinical assessment before and after the intervention for both the intervention and control groups, we only relied on a self-administered survey to test the behavioural changes at baseline and after 3 months which may increase the risk 
of information bias related to recall issues and social desir -
ability. Furthermore, although we conducted a multivaria-ble analysis, the risk of a residual confounding is still present. Further studies are suggested to confirm our find-ings and to perform a comparative study to check the effect of such an intervention on university students with different socio-economic levels.
Implications for practice and policy
Our findings showed significant differences between the 
intervention and the control groups for almost all variables at the 3-month follow-up. Results revealed that the inter -
vention had positive effects on the life of university students, as it promoted their LS and encouraged them to achieve an improved and healthier lifestyle and a better mental health status. This intervention can play an impor -
tant role in enhancing social, emotional and cognitive skills and helping young adults to achieve their goals, by strengthening their abilities to meet the demands of the present society and be successful in life. Khotwa program improved mental health, promoted healthy eating habits, improved weight status and boosted the LS of university students in this intervention. From a clinical perspective, the effect of LS intervention on students’ internalising behaviours examined in our study was promising in terms of its usefulness. Such interventions coupled with univer -
sity counseling showed to be associated with a reduction of psychological distress and an increase in life satisfac-tion amongst university students (Riva Crugnola et al., 2020). Therefore, university administrations should con-solidate the efforts with researchers to visualize the out-comes of such programs to their students and study both its short and long term effects on students’ mental and physi-cal health outcomes.
The inclusion of such a LS program in all universities 
as a mandatory or elective course has been advocated by a number of researchers in different countries (Botvin et al., 2001; Erawan, 2010; O’Hearn and Gatz, 1999; Papacharisis et al., 2005; Savoji and Ganji, 2013). This is even more important in the context of Lebanon given the dire social and economic situation, to help set students on a path to succeed in achieving a better quality of life and well-being (Haji et al., 2011). The majority of the LS programs in developing countries, including the ones implemented on ad-hoc basis in Lebanon, lack efficient implementation, assessment and monitoring (Nasheeda et al., 2019). The findings of our study indicate the need to recognize LS programs as part of the national curriculum. This can be spearheaded by drafting a policy similar to ones developed in both developing and developed countries such as Namibia (Ministry of Education, 2015), Cambodia (Kim, 2011), Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India (2014) and New Zealand (Chen, 2017) where LS is identified as one of the priority interventions for the overall development of youth. This policy can facilitate the implementation of this program at large within the educa-tional system of the country. One such example can be the provision of an online course through the website of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education or Center of Educational Research and Development in Lebanon. The development of this LS intervention in Arabic in our study can also facilitate its uptake and scaling up into the educa-tional system of other Arab countries or in Arab communi-ties elsewhere in the world.
