Objective: Due to global urbanization, technological advancements, and increasing convenience in daily
activities, reduced energy expenditure in all aspects of life has become a major public health concern. Apositive physical activity (PPA) intervention was developed to promote physical activity and fitnessamong Hong Kong families. PPA utilizes positive affective attitudes to circumvent barriers to healthbehavior change by helping families associate feelings of enjoyment with physical activity. Zero-TimeExercise (ZTEx) was introduced and promoted as a foot-in-the-door approach. Method: Using a
community-based collaborative approach, the research team worked with social service organizations, agovernment department, and schools to implement a cluster randomized controlled crossover trial at acitywide scale. A total of 1,983 eligible participants from 1,467 families were recruited from all 18districts in Hong Kong. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and physical fitnessassessments at preintervention and 1-month and 3-month follow-up. Results: PPA was effective in
increasing ZTEx and ZTEx with family members at 1-month and 3-month follow-up and in improvingbalance and endurance at 3-month follow-up. Semistructured focus groups provided further support forthe intervention effectiveness and added in-depth insights into the participants’ motivational, interper-sonal, and affective experiences. Conclusion: The results not only shed light on the intervention’s
effectiveness for physical activity and fitness but also demonstrated that the community-based collab-orative approach was successful in engaging relevant stakeholders in an active and fruitful partnershipwith effective capacity building for program development.

Physical activity (PA) is defined as the use of skeletal muscles
to produce any form of bodily movement for everyday functioning,such as activities pertaining to work, transportation, householdchores, and recreation ( World Health Organization [WHO],
2018a ). Because PA has significant benefits for health and fitness,
the WHO recommends that children and adults should engage in a

minimum of 60 min and 150 min of moderate-intensity PA per
week, respectively. However, due to global urbanization, techno-logical advancements, and increasing convenience in daily activ-ities, reduced energy expenditure in all aspects of life has becomea major public health concern. Physical inactivity is a major causeof mortality and a primary risk factor for noncommunicable dis-eases. Approximately 23% of adults and 81% of adolescentssurveyed did not meet the WHO recommendations worldwide, andthe prevalence is even more severe in developed countries ( WHO,
2018b ). In Hong Kong, a staggering 71% of adults did not meet
WHO recommendations on PA, 67% were physically inactive,53% spent 6 hr or more on sedentary behavior per day, and 91%did not engage in any PA with family members ( School of Public
Health, 2013 ). This persistent and growing health-related problem
calls for an urgent need to develop an intervention program thatcan effectively promote PA not only at the individual level but alsoat the family, community, and citywide levels. In light of theseconcerns, a set of community-based family “holistic health” inter-vention programs was developed, implemented, and evaluated inthe Happy Family Kitchen Movement (HFKM) project to promotewell-being and health in Hong Kong. By integrating positivepsychology concepts with health-promotion activities (i.e., PA andhealthy eating) in the programs, the results provided support foroverall intervention effectiveness on well-being outcomes, includ-ing family harmony, subjective happiness, and mental quality oflife ( Ho, Mui, Wan, Yew, & Lam, 2020 ). To extend our previous
work, the present article specifically reports findings on the phys-ical health outcomes of the positive physical activity (PPA) inter-vention from the HFKM to examine its effectiveness for promot-ing PA and fitness among families.
Various models of health behavior change have been adopted in
intervention programs that aim to increase PA. However, theyhave generally been criticized for inconsistent or lack of empiricalsupport for theory assumptions ( Marks, Murray, Evans, & Estacio,
2015 ). Although the intention to engage in health-promotion be-
haviors is presumed to be the primary mechanism of behaviorchange, it is often difficult to increase PA even when people havethe intention to be active and healthy ( Rhodes & Dickau, 2012 ).
Meta-analyses of PA intervention studies revealed that the currenttheory-based programs were no more effective than non-theory-based programs ( McEwan et al., 2019 ;Prestwich et al., 2014 ).
Furthermore, most the existing interventions were focused at theindividual level, disregarded the social context of PA, reportedhigh dropout rates and low intervention compliance, tailored in-terventions to selective recipients (patients, unhealthy individuals),targeted multiple health-promotion behaviors (PA, healthy diet,and smoking cessation), and required intensive engagement (anaverage of 18 contact hours) from program facilitators and recip-ients ( Albarracín, Wilson, Chan, Durantini, & Sanchez, 2018 ;
Marks et al., 2015 ;Prestwich et al., 2014 ). These barriers or
deficiencies reduce the feasibility, acceptability, and scalability ofthe interventions for real-world implementation in communitysettings. Community-based programs should be simple for imple-mentation by community stakeholders, oriented to behaviors thatcan easily be adopted, cost-effective with brief intervention ses-sions, and flexible for adaptation in social and health services.
Positive psychology, the scientific investigation of positive sub-
jective experiences, individual strengths and virtues, and positiveinstitutions that contribute to optimal human functioning ( Selig-man, 2002 ), can be adopted for the understanding, examination,
and promotion of PA and health. Increasing empirical evidencesuggests that subjective well-being has a salutary impact on a widerange of health outcomes, such as longevity, general health, im-mune functioning, and cardiovascular health ( Howell, Kern, &
Lyubomirsky, 2007 ). Scholars speculate that participation in
health-promotion behaviors may be the underlying mechanismlinking positive psychological states to physical health ( DuBois et
al., 2012 ). In particular, individuals with greater optimism and who
held positive attitudes about exercise were found to be more likelyto participate in PA and adhere to a recommended exercise routine.The upward spiral theory of lifestyle change was recently proposedto explain the role of positive emotions in promoting health be-havior change ( Van Cappellen, Rice, Catalino, & Fredrickson,
2018 ). According to the theory, successful lifestyle change results
from positive emotions experienced during a target health-promotion behavior, such as PA, which increasingly motivate theindividual to engage in that activity as personal resources arebroadened by the positive emotions. The motivation to engage inPA is a nonconscious, implicit process that helps to maintain theactivity through a positive feedback loop. Because positive emo-tions also serve to build biological (e.g., cardiac vagal tone),cognitive (e.g., mindfulness), psychological (e.g., flourishing), andsocial resources (e.g., social integration), the positive feedbackloop is further strengthened as these resources provide support forbehavioral maintenance of PA ( Fredrickson, 2013 ;Van Cappellen
et al., 2018 ).
A series of community-based interventions based on a positive
psychology framework and applied to family activities, such ascooking and dining together, has been conducted in Hong Kong topromote family communication and well-being ( Ho et al., 2016a ,
2016b ). The results showed salutary intervention effects on family
well-being. However, whether positive psychology concepts canbe integrated with health-promotion behaviors to enhance physicalhealth among families is largely unknown. The intervention de-scribed in the present article, namely, PPA, was developed withreference to positive psychology as a guiding framework and PAwith family members as a platform. The intervention utilizedpositive affective attitudes to circumvent barriers to health behav-ior change by helping families associate feelings of enjoymentwith PA. Through activating the incentive salience for PA, fami-lies would not only be motivated to change but also actuallyengage in it. With reference to previous positive psychology in-terventions conducted in Hong Kong ( Ho et al., 2016a ,2016b ) and
taking compatibility with PA into consideration, the positive psy-chology themes of joy, gratitude, and savoring were adopted inPPA. The joy theme emphasized short-term pleasures and long-term gratifications from PA and PA with family members ( Selig-
man, 2002 ). The gratitude theme involved the expression of thank-
fulness and appreciation to family members for doing and enjoyingPA together ( Peterson & Seligman, 2004 ). The savoring theme
focused on enjoying and cherishing the present moment and thequality time spent doing PA with family members ( Seligman,
Rashid, & Parks, 2006 ). The intervention programs were brief and
easy to implement so that people of all ages could engage inlifestyle change.
The target PA involved Zero-Time Exercise (ZTEx), which is
simple; does not require extra time; and can be done while sitting,standing, and walking by moving and stretching different parts ofThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

the body, such as the head, neck, shoulders, waist, back, and upper
and lower limbs ( Lam, Ho, Lau, Wan, & Chan, 2017 ;Lam et al.,
2016 ). ZTEx adopts a foot-in-the-door approach by starting with a
small amount of exercise during daily activities so as to match thebusy working lives of Hong Kong people. ZTEx is adaptive todifferent contexts and situations and can be made into an enjoyableactivity for family members of different generations to engage intogether. Examples of ZTEx include stationary cycling whilewatching TV, stretching various parts of the body during a meet-ing, doing squats while waiting for the bus, and punching whilewalking.
1The duration, flexibility, distance, and intensity of ZTEx
can be increased with practice to maximize health benefits. Re-search has shown that even intermittent exercise can producehealth benefits similar to those of continuous moderate-intensityexercise ( Gillen et al., 2014 ). ZTEx is consistent with the PA
guidelines for Americans, which emphasize that increases inbodily movement and reductions in sedentary behavior will benefitalmost everyone, especially individuals who are the least physi-cally active ( Piercy et al., 2018 ). ZTEx enables busy city dwellers
to practice PA in small steps in order to cultivate a healthierlifestyle and engage in more intensive physical exercise regimens.Pilot studies conducted on small samples showed that ZTEx train-ing could increase PA, reduce sedentary behavior, and improvephysical fitness ( Lai et al., 2019 ;Yeung et al., 2018 ).
Using a mixed-methods approach, this study aimed to examine
the secondary outcome measures of the HFKM by (a) testing thehypothesis that PPA is effective for promoting PA and fitness (i.e.,ZTEx and ZTEx with family members and physical fitness assess-ments of balance and endurance) and (b) providing in-depth in-sights into the participants’ motivational, interpersonal, and affec-tive experiences during health behavior change. The use of bothquantitative and qualitative methods provides the opportunity toexamine whether the intervention is effective, as well as why it iseffective, to shed light on the psychosocial processes involved(Marks et al., 2015 ). To the best of our knowledge, no similar
studies have been conducted to implement and evaluate acommunity-based family intervention that integrates positive psy-chology with health-promotion behaviors to enhance PA and fit-ness.
Method
Participants
The HFKM ( Ho et al., 2020 ) was a citywide project that in-
volved participants from all 18 districts in Hong Kong. It wasimplemented from May 2015 to October 2016. To maximize thegeneralizability of the study results and increase public healthimpact, more inclusive eligibility criteria were adopted ( Spoth,
Kavanagh, & Dishion, 2002 ). The selection criteria of this study
were as follows: (a) Cantonese speaking, (b) intact verbal andhearing abilities for interpersonal communication, (c) reading andwriting abilities for questionnaire completion, (d) aged 12 or olderfor participation in the intervention evaluation, and (e) attend theprogram sessions with one or more family members. Participantswere recruited from local social service organizations, the SocialWelfare Department of the Hong Kong government, kindergar-tens, and primary schools. Meta-analyses of over 200 studies withmore than 110,000 participants revealed small effect sizes inintervention studies that aim to facilitate health-promotion behav-
iors, including PA and healthy eating ( Albarracín et al., 2018 ;
Dusseldorp, van Genugten, van Buuren, Verheijden, & van Em-pelen, 2014 ;Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta,
2009 ). Prior research on community-based family interventions
with similar intensity, duration, and time points showed a maxi-mum dropout rate of about 50% at follow-up ( Ho et al., 2016a ,
2016b ). With reference to prior experience, a sample size of at
least 1,920 was required for this cluster randomized controlledcrossover trial (cRCT) to detect small effect sizes of .20 with astatistical power of .80, an /H9251of .05, and an attrition rate of 50%
while accounting for clustering effects ( Campbell, Thomson, Ram-
say, MacLennan, & Grimshaw, 2004 ). In total, 4,198 individuals
were invited, and 1,983 eligible participants from 1,467 familiesparticipated in the study.
Participants were recruited from social service organizations,
the government department, and schools through (a) promotionalmaterials such as posters, banners, leaflets, and publications; (b)phone invitations; (c) face-to-face invitations; (d) promotionthrough websites and e-mails; (e) home visits; and (f) referralsfrom social service workers and teachers. Written consent wasobtained prior to the study. For children enrolled in the study,written consent was obtained from the adult next of kin, caretakers,or guardians on their behalf. Participation was completely volun-tary, and participants had the right to withdraw at any time withoutconsequences. As an incentive for completing the questionnairesand physical fitness assessments, two HK$50 (about US$13) su-permarket gift vouchers were given to each participating family atthe end of the study. Ethics approval was granted by the Institu-tional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/HospitalAuthority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 15–083) and registeredunder ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02563613).
Procedure
Social service workers and teachers of the participating social
service organizations and schools were trained in a 2.5-day work-shop to design and implement the community programs. It wasimplemented from May 2015 to April 2016. The training work-shop was delivered by clinical psychologists, registered socialworkers, a registered nurse, and academic researchers to compre-hensively cover the contents of positive psychology, PA, programdesign, and program evaluation. Experiential learning was used tohelp trainees design and deliver family-friendly activities thatintegrate positive psychology themes with PA. Because all of thetrainees were exposed to the contents of the intervention in orderto deliver the different program sessions in a crossover trial, it was
inevitable for them to be knowledgeable about the study design.They were provided with a practice manual in addition to super-vision and consultation from the research team during the planningand implementation stages of the community programs so as toensure their quality and consistency.

cRCT was used to randomly allocate 54 clusters of social
service units and schools (from 28 nongovernmental organizations,1 government department, and 7 schools) into three groups: pos-itive physical activity (PPA), positive healthy diet (PHD), andcontrol (C). The randomization procedure was conducted usingcomputer-generated random numbers (allocation ratio of 1:1:1).An independent statistician who was not in contact with the socialservice units, schools, and participants performed the randomiza-tion and allocation. The participants were not informed about theother groups in the study. For the PPA group (Intervention Arm 1,consisting of 15 clusters, 528 participants), the participants re-ceived a core session of about 2 hr, followed by a booster sessionof about 1 hr 1 month later. For Group C (waitlist control arm,consisting of 20 clusters, 790 participants), the participants re-ceived a tea gathering session at the beginning and 1 month later.The core session in the PPA group consisted of group activitiesand homework assignments on positive psychology and PA; thebooster session in the PPA group involved the consolidation ofknowledge and skills obtained from the core session; and the teagathering sessions included activities unrelated to the intervention,such as arts and crafts workshops ( Ho et al., 2020 ). The PHD
group (Intervention Arm 2, consisting of 19 clusters, 665 partici-pants) is not described in detail here because it is outside the scopeof the present article. A crossover design was adopted in which theparticipants received a core session from another intervention armafter the outcomes had been assessed at 3 months (i.e., the PPAgroup subsequently received the PHD core session, the PHD groupsubsequently received the PPA core session, and Group C subse-quently received the PPA/PHD core session). This ensured that allof the participants had an opportunity to take part in the interven-tion programs because the study was conducted in the community.
To examine PA and fitness at the individual participant level,
structured questionnaires and physical fitness assessments wereadministered at preintervention (baseline assessment, T
1), 1-month
follow-up after the core session (before the booster session, T3),
and 3-month follow-up after the core session (T4). These outcomes
were not included immediately after the core session (T2) because
it was irrelevant to assess behavior change at this time. The time
points were chosen based on prior experience with community-based family interventions that modified behaviors for promotingwell-being and health within 3 months ( Ho et al., 2017 ). This is the
typical assessment duration for other similar interventions thatpromote health-related behavior change ( Albarracín et al., 2018 ).
Furthermore, 1-month and 3-month follow-ups aligned with thetime frame of intervention implementation so that the effects of thecore and booster sessions could be assessed. To minimize possiblebias from the program facilitators and research team in handlingthe outcome assessments, the structured questionnaires were self-administered with standardized instructions, and the physical fit-ness assessments followed a standardized protocol with a prere-corded video to guide the procedure across all groups. As indicatedby the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)flow diagram in Figure 1 (Egger, Jüni, Bartlett, & the CONSORT
Group, 2001 ), the retention rate for the PPA group was 87.3% at
T
3and 77.7% at T4, whereas for Group C, it was 87.2% at T3and
75.4% at T4.
Semistructured focus groups were conducted with the partici-
pants after the completion of the community programs andfollow-up sessions. Purposive sampling was used to recruit thosewho attended both the core and booster sessions in PPA. Two
trained interviewers conducted 11 focus groups for a total of 92participants. Semistructured interview guidelines and promptswere developed according to a standardized focus-group protocol(Krueger & Casey, 2000 ) to provide in-depth insights into the
participants’ experiences, underlying motivations, and thoughtsand feelings associated with behavior change, or lack of change,during and after participating in the intervention program. Flexi-bility was allowed during the group discussions to enable unan-ticipated themes to emerge. The focus groups were audio-recordedand lasted for approximately 60 min in a quiet venue. A separatewritten consent was obtained prior to the interview, and participa-tion was completely voluntary. Another HK$50 supermarket giftvoucher was given to each participant as an incentive.
Intervention Programs
After receiving the training workshop, social service workers
and teachers designed and implemented the PPA programs byemphasizing on one of the three positive psychology themes oftheir choice (i.e., joy, gratitude, and savoring). The flexibility forinterventionists to tailor their own programs enabled the uniqueneeds of families from different clusters to be accommodated. Theoverall objective of the intervention was the same for all programsregardless of the choice of themes, which was to promote ZTExand ZTEx with family members. In total, 58 intervention programswere implemented within the period from July 2015 to October2016.
ZTEx and ZTEx with family members were promoted in the
programs through positive psychology themes. Each theme con-sisted of three target behaviors for participants to engage in duringgroup activities and homework assignments so that PA could beencouraged, reinforced, and sustained. The joy theme involved (a)sharing happy experiences in PA with family members, (b) dis-covering joy during PA, and (c) reminiscing about a PA experiencethat made one or one’s family happy. The gratitude theme involved(a) appreciating the strengths of family members during PA andexpressing one’s gratitude for doing and enjoying PA together tofamily members through (b) words and (c) actions. The savoringtheme involved (a) paying attention to the process of PA, (b)savoring the moment of PA, and (c) treasuring quality time duringPA with family members ( Ho et al., 2020 ). These behaviors were
practiced during the intervention through hands-on experientiallearning so that positive emotions were elicited and characterstrengths were utilized within a positive environment. Homeworkassignments were used to reinforce these behaviors on a routinebasis.
Onsite observation was conducted at each of the core, booster,
and tea gathering sessions to ensure the quality and consistency ofthe intervention programs. The degree of adherence in deliveringthe core messages of the intervention during the core (85.5%) andbooster sessions (87.8%) was high. The degree of adherence to thefitness assessment protocol at T
1(85%), T3(84.5%), and T4
(85.1%) was also high. As rated on a scale of 1 to 5, the activitiesdesigned by the program facilitators for the core (mean [ M]/H11005

quality. Furthermore, the intervention participants were activelyThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Measures
ZTEx and ZTEx with family members. Participants self-
reported the frequency of ZTEx and ZTEx with family members inthe past 4 weeks on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 ( never )t o1 0
(very frequently ). The operational definition of ZTEx was provided
to the participants to improve the validity of the instrument ( Iwai
et al., 2001 ). This approach is commonly used to assess
intervention-specific health behavior change ( Hawkins et al.,
2010 ;Park & Gaffey, 2007 ). Self-report single-item measures of
PA have been evaluated for reliability and validity among adoles-

cents ( Ng et al., 2019 ), older adults ( Gill, Jones, Zou, & Speechley,
2012 ), and healthy adult populations ( Silsbury, Goldsmith, &
Rushton, 2015 ), which provided empirical evidence for good to
excellent test–retest reliability; moderate to good convergent, con-current, and discriminant validity against other self-report mea-sures of PA and health; and moderate to good criterion validityagainst objective accelerometer data ( Milton, Bull, & Bauman,
2011 ;Milton, Clemes, & Bull, 2013 ;Wanner et al., 2014 ).
Balance. Balance is a health indicator of physical fitness
essential for preventing injuries and falls during daily activitiesand sports ( Muehlbauer, Gollhofer, & Granacher, 2015 ). Partici-
pants were asked to perform the single-leg stance by standing onone leg of their choice, with the other leg raised such that the raisedfoot was close to the ankle of the standing leg but without touchingit (Springer, Marin, Cyhan, Roberts, & Gill, 2007 ). During the
assessment, participants’ eyes remained open, looking forward,with the arms crossed over the chest. A stopwatch was used tomeasure the amount of time each participant was able to stand onone leg, with a maximum of 120 s. The time of assessment endedwhen the participants either uncrossed their arms, touched thestanding leg or floor with the raised foot, or moved the standingfoot to maintain balance or when the maximum time had beenreached. The procedure was repeated twice, and each time wasreported on a record sheet. To ensure adherence to the single-leg-stance protocol, a video prepared by the research team to demon-strate the procedure was shown on a large screen. Research assis-tants and volunteers provided assistance, monitored the procedure,and informed the participants that their assessment had endedwhen necessary.
Endurance. Muscular endurance is defined as the functional
capacity of a muscle or group of muscles to perform repetitivemotions over a period of time ( Bemben, 1998 ). It is a health
indicator for cardiovascular and respiratory fitness, mobility lim-itation, body composition, and mortality ( Roshanravan et al., 2017 ;
Vaara et al., 2014 ). Participants were asked to perform stationary
cycling by sitting on a stable chair while leaning on its back, withthe hands holding on to both sides, the hips flexed, the kneesslightly bent, and the hamstrings off the chair ( Lam et al., 2016 ,
2017 ). During the assessment, participants flexed the right hip with
the right knee up and then returned to the original position with theright knee down and then successively flexed the left hip with theleft knee up and then returned to the original position with the leftknee down. This cycling movement was done at a pace of 1 cycleper second, with a maximum of 120 s. A stopwatch was used tomeasure the amount of time each participant was able to cycle, andthe assessment ended when the participants either rested their legson the chair with the hamstrings touching it, placed their feet onthe floor, or stopped the cycling movement or when the maximumtime had been reached. The procedure was repeated twice, andeach time was reported on a record sheet. A video was used todemonstrate the procedure, and research assistants and volunteersprovided assistance during the assessment.
Data Analysis
Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS) 25.0. Pearson’s chi-square tests andmultilevel linear mixed models were conducted to examine thecomparability of demographic characteristics and baseline scoresamong the groups. Based on the principle of intention-to-treat
analysis ( Fisher et al., 1990 ), missing data were imputed using the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which is an iterativeprocedure to identify maximum likelihood estimates ( Schafer &
Graham, 2002 ). Multilevel linear mixed models were conducted
with the fixed effect of group allocation (i.e., PPA and C), andrandom effects of individuals (Level 1) nested within families(Level 2) nested within programs (Level 3). Self-reported PA andobjective physical fitness assessed at T
3and T4were included as
outcome variables. Age, sex, education level, and baseline values
at T1were included as control variables. Between-group differ -
ences in the outcome changes (i.e., PPA vs. C) and within-groupchanges across time points were examined (i.e., T
1vs. T3,T1vs.
T4). The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to
determine the relatedness of clustered data.
To ensure the reliability of the qualitative data, audio recordings
were transcribed verbatim into Chinese. Thematic analysis wasused to identify themes within the qualitative data ( Braun &
Clarke, 2006 ). Transcripts were read in detail, and broad themes
were recorded. An in-depth analysis was then conducted using aprocess of constant comparisons to identify main themes andsubthemes. To ensure objectivity during the analysis, a panel ofresearchers performed the coding analysis. Consensus was reachedby reanalyzing the themes and checking the codes when necessary.The transcripts were reviewed to ensure that all meaningful inter-view data had been exhausted. Qualitative findings are reported intheonline supplemental materials .
Results
Demographic Characteristics and Baseline Measures
The majority of the participants were aged 20 to 59 years, were
female, and received secondary education (see Table 1 ). The PPA
group had a higher proportion of males, /H92732(1)/H110055.16, p/H11005.02, and
lower education level than Group C, /H92732(4)/H1100515.68, p/H11005.003. No
statistically significant differences were detected between the two
groups on age. The PPA group scored lower on balance thanGroup C at baseline ( b/H11005/H11002 5.21, standard error [ SE]/H110052.17, p/H11005
.02). Baseline scores of ZTEx, ZTEx with family members, andendurance were not significantly different between the two groups.
Intervention Effectiveness
Table 2 shows that the PPA group’s increase in ZTEx at T3and
T4was significantly greater than that of Group C ( b/H11005.55,SE/H11005
.14,p/H11021.001, d/H11005.29 and b/H11005.61,SE/H11005.13,p/H11021.001, d/H11005.35,
respectively; see Part A of Figure 2 ). Furthermore, the PPA
group’s increase in ZTEx with family members at T3and T4was
significantly greater than that of Group C ( b/H11005.85,SE/H11005.15,p/H11021

respectively; see Part B of Figure 2 ). For physical fitness assess-
ments, the PPA group’s improvement in balance at T4(b/H110054.46,
SE/H110051.56, p/H11005.004, d/H11005.18; see Part A of Figure 3 ) and
endurance at T4(b/H110053.49, SE/H110051.65, p/H11005.03,d/H11005.14; see Part
Bo f Figure 3 ) was significantly greater than that of Group C. ICCs
ranged from .11 to .35.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Table 2 shows that there were significant within-group increases
from baseline in the PPA group on ZTEx at T3and T4(p/H11021.001,
d/H11005.34 and p/H11021.001, d/H11005.38, respectively), ZTEx with family
members at T3and T4(p/H11021.001, d/H11005.47 and p/H11021.001, d/H11005.43,
respectively), balance at T4(p/H11005.02,d/H11005.09), and endurance at
T4(p/H11021.001, d/H11005.16). For Group C, there were significant
within-group increases from baseline on ZTEx with family mem-
bers at T3and T4(p/H11005.01, d/H11005.16 and p/H11021.001, d/H11005.22,respectively) and significant within-group decreases from baseline
on balance at T3and T4(p/H11005.02,d/H11005.07 and p/H11005.003, d/H11005.09,
respectively).
Discussion
The results showed that PPA was effective in increasing ZTEx
and ZTEx with family members at 1-month and 3-month follow-up, with a small effect size. Furthermore, PPA was effective inTable 1

improving balance and endurance at 3-month follow-up, with a
small effect size. Within-group improvements were also observedin PPA for ZTEx (T
3,T4), ZTEx with family members (T3,T4),
balance (T4), and endurance (T4). The control group showed
within-group improvements in ZTEx with family members (T3,
T4), decline in balance (T3,T4), and no changes in ZTEx and
endurance. The qualitative results provided further support for the
intervention effectiveness and added in-depth insight into theparticipants’ motivational, interpersonal, and affective experiencesassociated with PA after participating in the program (see theonline supplemental materials ). The results are consistent with
those found in the literature on health behavior change interven-tions, which typically produced small effect sizes of d/H11005.23
(Albarracín et al., 2018 ),d/H11005.31 (Michie et al., 2009 ), or g/H11005.31
(Dusseldorp et al., 2014 ) for both self-reported and objective
measures of health-related behaviors, including PA and healthyeating. However, prior studies used multiple sessions to deliver theintervention, which typically spanned over a period of 25 weeks(Michie et al., 2009 ) or lasted for approximately 18 hr on average
(Albarracín et al., 2018 ). PPA is not only effective for promoting
PA and fitness, but it is also cost-beneficial, requiring only twosessions, approximately 3 hr in total, making it a more feasible andacceptable option for implementation in community settings. Thepresent study should be considered for its merits in (a) developingan innovative and practical health behavior change intervention,(b) implementing and evaluating the intervention in a territory-wide community context, (c) increasing the public health impactby targeting universal samples, (d) accounting for accessibility bytraining nonhealth professionals to become the source of delivery,and (e) extending the intended benefits beyond the study partici-pants via close collaboration with the social service and educationsectors.
The study findings provide support for the major proposition of
the upward spiral theory of lifestyle change in which health-promotion behaviors are undertaken and maintained when positive
emotions are experienced during these activities ( Van Cappellen et
al., 2018 ). Through the application of positive psychology themes,
participants were able to associate feelings of enjoyment withZTEx, which nurtured nonconscious motives for that health-promotion behavior and in turn led to successful lifestyle change.Physical fitness was ultimately improved. Nonconscious motivesderived from the incentive salience of ZTEx were a central mech-anism accounting for the maintenance of health-promotion behav-ior (Van Cappellen et al., 2018 ), as supported by sustained en-
gagement in ZTEx and ZTEx with family members for up to 3months. Whereas traditional forms of PA, such as going to thegym, jogging, hiking, and swimming, require extensive efforts toplan the behavior by evaluating the pros and cons, assessing thepotential barriers, and setting specific goals ( Ajzen, 1985 ), ZTEx
utilizes the implicit motivational benefits of incentive saliencebecause it can be done anytime and anywhere. The participants didnot have to go through great lengths to plan ZTEx, as indicated bythe qualitative interviews. As a foot-in-the-door approach, ZTExaims at getting inactive individuals to comply to a large request formore regular and greater amounts of moderate to vigorous PA byhaving them agree to a modest request first for intermittent lower-intensity PA that is more readily integrated into daily life ( Lai et
al., 2019 ;Yeung et al., 2018 ). Because the positive affect experi-
enced during ZTEx broadens and builds biological, cognitive,psychological, and social resources, which in turn serve to amplifythe effects of positive emotion on health behavior change andmaintenance ( Fredrickson, 2013 ), individuals who engage in ZTEx
would set a healthier lifestyle in motion with increasingly strongermotivation and more positive attitudes toward PA over time.Recent studies showed that induced feelings of joy can lead toincreased activation and enhanced prioritization of PA goals,greater willingness to engage in various types of PA, and actualengagement in those activities ( Cameron, Bertenshaw, & Sheeran,T1 T3 T4

2018 ). Further research is needed to examine whether PPA can
promote engagement in more intensive forms of PA in the longrun.
Although the study was conducted in Hong Kong, the findings
should be generalizable to Western populations. The community-based intervention adopted a positive psychology framework thatoriginated in the United States ( Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi,
2000 ). Positive psychology interventions have been extensively
examined in the West and have consistently shown beneficialeffects on a wide range of outcomes for psychosocial well-beingand mental health, including increased happiness, positive af-fect, mental quality of life, and resilience, as well as reducedpessimism, negative affect, and depressive symptoms ( Bolier et
al., 2013 ;Odou & Vella-Brodrick, 2013 ;Pietrowsky & Mikutta,
2012 ;Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005 ;Sin & Ly-
ubomirsky, 2009 ). Therefore, individuals from Western coun-
tries (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and Australia)should be similarly susceptible to the intervention activities thatemphasize positive affect, positive behavior, and positive cog-nition (i.e., joy, gratitude, and savoring) adopted in the presentstudy. In addition, although the intervention program is familybased, it is not only oriented for collectivistic cultures. Empir-ical evidence suggests that social support from family is animportant determinant of PA across all age groups ( Gill et al.,
2018 ;Lindsay Smith, Banting, Eime, O’Sullivan, & van
Uffelen, 2017 ;Wang, Pbert, & Lemon, 2014 ), especially if
those family members can form a social norm for healthylifestyles by also being physically active themselves ( Scarapi-
cchia, Sabiston, Pila, Arbour-Nicitopoulos, & Faulkner, 2017 ).
Increased levels of moderate to vigorous PA from family sup-port were consistently found across Western countries ( Van
Dyck et al., 2014 ). Therefore, family-based interventions have
been recommended internationally for promoting PA amongmales and females, young and old. Nevertheless, for popula-tions that prefer PA to be enacted in individual and/or nonfa-milial group contexts, many positive psychology themes thathave been proven to be effective in the literature ( DuBois et al.,
2012 ) can be adapted for integration with PA or specifically
ZTEx. For example, the “best possible self” is an optimismexercise in which participants are asked to imagine their bestpossible physical health over the next several years and con-sider how to take steps toward a healthy lifestyle. Anotherexample is “pleasurable and meaningful acts,” which is apurpose-finding exercise in which participants are asked tocomplete the following three acts each day: (a) a pleasurable actdone alone (e.g., working out at a fitness center), (b) a plea-surable act done with others (e.g., jogging with friends), and (c)a meaningful act (e.g., writing a physical activity diary). Futureresearch can explore the various options in positive psychologyfor promoting PA among different populations and contexts.
The results of this study should be considered with the
following limitations. First, as is the case with all interventionstudies, the participants voluntarily chose to take part in thestudy, so self-selection bias is inevitable. The participantsmight be more aware of the psychological and physical needs oftheir family members and were more motivated to engage inhealth behavior change than those who did not participate.Second, it was impractical and unethical to decline socialservice users and students of the social service centers andschools from joining the community programs on the basis of
the study inclusion criteria or consent to provide research data.Therefore, there were more people enrolled in the communityprograms than the actual number of eligible participants whotook part in the study. Third, ZTEx was self-reported, so theresults might be susceptible to response bias. However, it wasnot practicable to use pedometers, accelerometers, heart-ratemonitors, or armbands in this study because they are too costlyfor a large-scale community-based program ( Wanner et al.,
2014 ). Furthermore, because ZTEx involves bodily movement
during daily activities, motion monitor devices and sensors maynot be able to distinguish the movements and workloads fromother forms of PA ( Silsbury et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, positive
results from the objective physical fitness assessments corrob-orated with self-reports on health behavior change. Fourth,performance on the fitness assessments of balance and endur-ance did not depend only on physical fitness but also thewillpower to persist. This might explain the significant declinein balance for the control group because although the fitnessassessments might have been novel and interesting to the par-ticipants at baseline, they likely lost interest by T
4without
proper education and promotion. Increasing participants’ moti-
vation to engage in health behavior change for improvingphysical health was an important mechanism of PPA. Fifth,because assessments were administered at 1-month and3-month follow-up, the sustainability of the long-term interven-tion effects on PA and physical fitness is unknown. Neverthe-less, this is one of the few community-based studies on healthbehavior change interventions that reported postinterventionfollow-up data ( Dzewaltowski, Estabrooks, Klesges, Bull, &
Glasgow, 2004 ). Furthermore, it was meant to be a foot-in-the-
door approach to engage inactive city dwellers to start with asmall amount of exercise so as to facilitate subsequent compli-ance with more intensive physical exercise regimens. Futureresearch is encouraged to integrate PPA into the initial stage ofprograms for health behavior change intervention so that par-ticipants can practice ZTEx as a small step toward being phys-ically active. Sixth, the results of this study showed small sizeeffects because low-intensity, brief intervention sessions wereprovided to the general population. However, this approach is inline with the public health approach in which effective andcost-beneficial interventions that reach and benefit large num-bers of the general public can be valuable ( Spoth et al., 2002 ).
The study contributes by expanding our knowledge of effectivestrategies for individual and family engagement, guiding utili-zation of empirically supported interventions in the community,and informing more ecologically sensitive intervention re-search. Finally, Bonferroni correction was not applied for test-ing multiple hypotheses in this study because (a) PPA was at theinitial stage of development, in which it was more important tonot miss a possible effect worthy of further study; (b) therewould be an increased likelihood of Type II errors due to thereduced statistical power to detect an effect; and (c) a priorihypotheses were determined before any data were collected andanalyzed, as specified in the clinical trials registration ( Arm-
strong, 2014 ;Perneger, 1998 ). More conservative tests can be
performed in future studies to confirm and replicate the study
results with different populations.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

The HFKM project was a large-scale, citywide cRCT to
examine the effectiveness of a community-based family inter-vention in Hong Kong. It was conducted in close collaborationwith numerous community partners from different organiza-tions in the social service and education sectors. The results notonly shed light on the intervention effectiveness on PA andfitness for the general population but also demonstrated that thecommunity-based collaborative approach was successful in en-gaging relevant stakeholders in an active and fruitful partner-ship with effective capacity building for program development.The HFKM laid a good foundation and served as a practicalexample for nonhealth professionals from similar urban areas todesign and deliver cost-effective PA intervention programs forphysically inactive city dwellers.
