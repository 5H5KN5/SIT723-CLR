Objective: Emotions are key predictors of sexual risk behavior but have been largely ignored in
theory-based intervention development. The present study aims to evaluate whether the addition of anemotional education intervention component to a traditional social–cognitive safer sex interventionincreases intervention efficacy, compared with both a social–cognitive only intervention and a nointervention control condition. Methods: Young adults were randomized in small groups to receive the
social–cognitive–emotional (SCE) intervention, the social–cognitive (SC) intervention, or standard ofcare. Results: Analyses of data from 176 participants indicated that intervention arms reported similar
increased condom use compared with the no intervention control arm at 3 months’ postintervention ( /H9252/H11005
.06,p/H11005.41,d/H110050.08). However, at 6 months’ postintervention, individuals in the SCE intervention arm
reported increased condom use compared with both the SC intervention ( /H9252/H11005 .27,p/H11005.04,d/H110050.38) and
control arms ( /H9252/H11005 .37,p/H11021.01;d/H110050.56), demonstrating preliminary evidence that the addition of an
emotional education component may facilitate sustained behavior change. Conclusions: An emotional
education intervention module has the potential to facilitate sustained behavior change at delayedfollow-up. Additional research is necessary to replicate findings in a larger sample and to determine themediators of emotional education intervention efficacy.

Condom use is inconsistent among young adults (e.g., Kiene,
Barta, Tennen, & Armeli, 2009), leading to unplanned pregnancy,human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syn-drome (HIV/AIDS), and other sexually transmitted infections(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010, 2011). Currentinterventions for sexual risk reduction are largely informed bymodels that address social–cognitive factors (Noar, 2008), whichoffer a useful way to conceptualize and change health behaviors(Glanz & Bishop, 2010) and provide a theoretical framework forevaluating how interventions work—or why they do not work(Rothman, 2004).These models assume that emotions “work through” and are
captured in the measurement of other constructs (e.g., Fishbein &Ajzen, 1975), which may make it difficult to ascertain whatemotions to address to facilitate safer behavior. Indeed, emotionsare rarely explicitly addressed in SC interventions. Even morecomprehensive models that address motivational factors, such asthe Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975)and the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model(Fisher, Fisher, & Harman, 2003), operationalize measurement ofthese factors as attitudes and social norms rather than emotion.This may have consequences, because emotion is a critical elementin decision making (e.g., Loewenstein & Lerner, 2003), risk as-sessment (Lerner & Keltner, 1999; Patrick, Blair, & Maggs, 2008),information processing, (e.g., Clore, Gasper, & Garvin, 2002), andbehavior counter to the actor’s best interest (Loewenstein, 1996).Emotion may, at times, be more predictive of behavior than SCinfluences (Lawton, Conner, & McEachan, 2009; Norton, Bogart,Cecil, & Pinkerton, 2005), and its influence can endure long afterthe emotional experience itself has ceased (Andrande & Ariely,
2009). Emotion is a critical component of sexual behaviors spe-cifically (e.g., Buck, Anderson, Chaudhuri, & Ray, 2004; Philpott,Knerr, & Maher, 2006; Sanchez, Caballero, Carrera, Blanco, &Pizarro, 2001), particularly among youth (e.g., Ethier et al.,
2006; Mutanski, 2007).
One way to intervene on emotions is through emotional educa-
tion(Buck, 1990). Although individuals have generalized access to
their subjective emotions, they may be unable to identify the causeof the emotion or even the emotion itself. Complicating matters,

individuals are relatively poor at anticipating their emotions (e.g.,
Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, & Wheatley, 1998), which canlead them to underestimate effects of emotion on behavior, par-ticularly in situations in which emotions are complex and intense(Loewenstein, 1996). Emotional education is the process by whichindividuals learn to identify and label the emotions they experi-ence. When an individual is able to identify experienced emotionsconfidently and reliably, and can deal with and express themeffectively in an adaptive manner, this is considered emotional
competence (e.g., Buck, 1990; Buck & Powers, in press). Emo-
tional education may be one way to help individuals to accuratelyanticipate emotions and develop advance strategies to deal withthem in a way that facilitates safer sexual behavior. Note that
emotional education differs from largely inefficacious fear ap-peals, which attempt to induce fear of contracting HIV (Earl &Albarracı ´n, 2007). In contrast, emotional education facilitates the
recognition and anticipation of a complex range of emotions thatindividuals report feeling in sexual situations.
Emotional education occurs naturally, but has also been pro-
posed as a means of changing behavior (e.g., Buck, 1990; Shaugh-nessy & Shakesby, 1992), although no studies published to datehave used emotional education interventions. In advertising, how-ever, emotional education approaches are common and effective infacilitating sustained behavior change (e.g., Buck & Davis, 2010;Chaudhuri, 2006). For example, “branding” involves educatingindividuals to associate affectively laden images with a brand inorder to increase certain emotions associated with that brand,leading to purchase behavior (e.g., Greifender, Bless, &Kuschmann, 2007).
We examined whether adding an emotional education module to
a social-cognitive intervention (informed by the IMB model) in-creases its efficacy. Our hypotheses are as follows: (a) the emo-tional education module paired with the social-cognitive interven-tion will increase condom use compared with the social-cognitiveintervention or the control condition; and (b) the social-cognitiveintervention will increase condom use compared with the controlcondition.
Method
Participants
Two hundred traditional college students were recruited from
two university participant pools; two declined to participate duringthe consent process. Because intervention content would differ forabstinent and sexually active individuals, and in order to maximizethe potential for sex to be reported within the follow-up period,only those who had ever had sex were invited to participate. Tominimize attrition, we used reminder e-mails and telephone calls.Participants were compensated for follow-ups with gift certifi-cates. Fully 176 were retained for first follow-up, and 160 partic-ipants were retained for second follow-up (10% attrition). Attritionwas not selective based on demographics, sexual activity at base-line, or study condition. Those who did not elect to participate infollow-ups were either unreachable or gave no reason for theirdecision.Procedure
The study involved a baseline assessment, a 120-min interven-
tion, and two online follow-up measures, 3 and 6 months’ postin-tervention. The intervention was delivered to mixed-gender groupsof 10 to 15 participants. Each group of subjects was randomlyassigned (using a randomization program) to one of three condi-tions: social-cognitive plus emotion (SCE; n/H1100568) intervention,
Social-Cognitive (SC) intervention ( n/H1100567), or standard of care
control condition (no intervention beyond standard material pre-sented by the university; n/H1100564).
1Analyses were undertaken to
evaluate the equivalence of individuals in each condition. The first
author, who was a fifth-year social psychology doctoral studentwith extensive training in health behavior theory and interventiondevelopment, served as intervention facilitator for all groups, andadhered strictly to a standard written intervention protocol for eachcondition. There was no external monitoring of fidelity, but giventhe nature of the intervention and the use of tools that would notvary by groups, we are confident that drift, if it did occur, wouldhave been minimal. Identical measures were completed at base-line, 3 months’ postintervention, and 6 months’ postintervention.Participants were asked whether they had had sex in the pastmonth (yes/no) and what percentage of the time condoms wereused during sex (vaginal and anal) in the past month.
Intervention Content
Theemotion intervention module was designed to help individ-
uals to identify and anticipate specific emotions (emotional edu-cation), and to facilitate the enactment of strategies to respond tothese emotions in a health promoting manner (emotional compe-tence). The intervention utilized videos to facilitate emotionaleducation and competence, because individuals often seek outvideos for emotional education in everyday life (e.g., Buck, 1988;Boyanowsky, Newtson, & Walster, 1972; Buck & Powers, inpress). Relevant emotions were identified a priori (Buck et al.,2004), and videos were designed to highlight ways that individualsmight be able to experience love andcaring for a partner by using
condoms, and to associate condoms with confidence andsecurity
in a sexual situation. Furthermore, videos were designed to facil-itate anticipation of embarrassment orguilt associated with not
using a condom. Finally, the videos demonstrated ways that con-dom use could lead to eroticism (e.g., putting a condom on with
one’s mouth). The videos showcased attractive and “cool” collegestudents discussing sexual situations with friends or talking with apartner immediately prior to engaging in sex. These situationswere designed to evoke specific these emotions in the viewers.Facilitator-led discussion followed—a common technique for re-inforcing intervention messages (Fisher, Fisher, Bryan, & Misov-ich, 2002; Fisher, Fisher, Misovich, Kimble, & Malloy, 1996).Discussion highlighted the need to translate anticipation of these
1Although randomization occurred at the group level, analyses occurred
at the individual level. Condom use did not differ by group at baseline, and
was included in analyses as a covariate. In addition, attrition did not differby group. The interaction between group session and study condition wasincluded in an original set of analyses, but there were no significant effects,providing further support for individual-level analyses. Note that individ-uals within each group were generally not known to one another.657 EMOTIONAL EDUCATION AND SEXUAL RISK REDUCTION
emotions into motivation to engage in and strategies to support
safer sex. For example, anticipation of caring for a partner asso-ciated with condom use can motivate an individual to want to useone. In addition, anticipation of guilt associated with condomnonuse can be translated into advance planning that could result incondom use, such as bringing condoms on a date.
The social-cognitive intervention modules that comprised a crit-
ical part of the SCE intervention were adapted and updated froman IMB Model-based intervention for college students that waspreviously demonstrated to be effective (Fisher et al., 1996). Theintervention was substantially shortened for the current purpose(from six 120-min sessions to a single 120-min session). Targetingweaknesses in sexual risk-related information , a PowerPoint slide
show was used to deliver facts and correct erroneous heuristicdecision-making rules. This slide show was created based on thetransparencies from the original intervention. Risk-related motiva-
tion (attitudes and social norms toward preventive behavior, as
well as perceptions of personal vulnerability to HIV and sexuallytransmitted infections [STI]), were targeted through a video de-picting individuals who had contracted HIV through unsafe het-erosexual contact. The script from the original video was updatedto reflect current popular terminology, and the video was refilmed.Behavioral skills for condom use its negotiation were also targeted
via a video, which depicted correct use, as well as a PowerPointslide show and discussion concerning negotiation of condom usewith different kinds of sexual partners. Facilitator-led discussionsreinforcing content followed each module.
Intervention Content by Condition
The SC condition comprised only the social-cognitive interven-
tion modules. The SCE condition comprised both the social-cognitive and emotion modules. To ensure that the conditions wereof similar length, some peripheral content was trimmed from thesocial-cognitive modules in SCE condition; specifically, the infor-mational slide show was shortened without loss of pertinent con-tent, as was discussion of various heuristic decision-making rules;the motivational video was shortened slightly, as were discussionsof attitudes and social norms for condom use; and the behavioralskills slide show was shortened as well, as were discussions aboutskills for facilitating condom use in various situations. The controlcondition received no intervention and only completed the baselinemeasures.
Analysis Strategy
The main planned comparison of interest examined whether the
SCE intervention outperformed the SC intervention. A plannedcomparison between the SCE model intervention and the controlwas undertaken to further confirm the efficacy of the SCE inter-vention. Finally, the SC intervention was compared with the con-trol, as a manipulation test to confirm SC intervention efficacy. Allanalyses were performed in SPSS 15. Evaluation of group differ-ences at each follow-up interval was conducted, with an ordinaryleast squares (OLS) regression approach to determine potentialeffects specific to a given follow-up (3 and 6 months’ postinter-vention).
2Baseline condom use and gender were included as
covariates in all analyses.Results
Participant Characteristics
Of the 176 traditional college student participants included in
analyses, most were White (81%) or Black (10%), and 52% werewomen. At baseline, 66% reported sex in the past month, and meanpercentage of condom use was 32.50% ( SD/H1100540.65). There were
no significant differences in demographics, sex in the past month, orpercentage of condom use at baseline by study arm (see Figure 1).
Main Outcomes
At 3 months, mean condom use was 65% in the SCE arm ( SD/H11005
44), 60% in the SC arm ( SD/H1100547), and 35% in the control
condition ( SD/H1100543). At 6 months, mean condom use was 67% in
the SCE arm ( SD/H1100542), 52% in the SC arm ( SD/H1100547), and 35%
in the control condition ( SD/H1100541). The SCE arm did not differ
from the SC arm at 3 months ( /H9252/H11005 .06,p/H11005.41,d/H110050.08) but there
was a significant difference at 6-month follow-up ( /H9252/H11005 .27,p/H11005
.04, d/H110050.38). The SCE arm reported higher percentage of
condom use at both 3 ( /H9252/H11005 .33,p/H11005.02;d/H110050.49) and 6 months
(/H9252/H11005 .37,p/H11021.01;d/H110050.56). The SC intervention in this study did
not appear to increase condom use at 3 ( /H9252/H11005 .21,p/H11005.11,d/H11005
0.27) or 6 months ( /H9252/H11005 .19,p/H11005.12,d/H110050.27).
Discussion
This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that incor-
porating an emotional education component into a social-cognitiveintervention may help to facilitate sexual risk reduction. The SCEarm reported greater condom use at both follow-ups comparedwith the control arm. In addition, the SCE intervention sustainedcondom use at 6 months’ postintervention compared with the SCintervention, which is important given that sexual risk reductioninterventions have difficulty sustaining behavior change over time(e.g., Copenhaver, Johnson, Lee, Harman, & Carey, 2006; Mullen,Ramirez, Strouse, Hedges, & Sogolow, 2002). Effect sizes weremedium, which is unusual for brief interventions, with few excep-tions (e.g., Dilley, Woods, & Sabatino, 2002; Jemmott, Jemmott, &
Fong, 1992; Jemmott, Jemmott, Fong, & McCaffree, 1999; Sand-erson, 1999). These findings are not surprising in light of researchdemonstrating the importance of emotion in decision-making (e.g.,Loewenstein & Lerner, 2003) and sexual behavior (e.g., Buck etal., 2004; Mutanski, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2001).
This is the first study to test the possibility that emotional
education interventions may be efficacious in changing healthbehaviors. However, one major limitation of this study concernsthe limited significance of the findings, which could be due tosmall sample size and lack of power. This study was a pilot test of
2The distribution condom use yielded skewness (.16, SE/H11005.14) and
kurtosis ( /H110021.81, SE/H11005.28) statistics that did not grossly violate the
assumptions of regression on a normally distributed outcome. However,condom use had a tri-modal distribution, characterized by a large numberof “0” and “100” values as well as many other values spread out fairlyevenly between those two points. As such, we undertook ancillary ordinallogistic regression analyses; these results were consistent, and as such, onlythe OLS regression results are presented.658 FERRER, FISHER, BUCK, AND AMICO
the intervention component, and future research is necessary to
replicate this finding in larger samples to confirm efficacy. Inaddition, this study was not powered to test complex mediationalrelationships, and therefore although it is hypothesized that theintervention was efficacious because it increased emotional com-petence in sexual situations, more research is necessary to evaluatemechanisms of efficacy.
Of note is the tendency for the SC intervention to be less
efficacious than expected. This limitation can be explained by thefact that the intervention from which it was adapted benefited froma longer and more intervention sessions, greater developmentresources, and a larger sample size (Fisher et al., 1996). Anotherlimitation concerned the use of paper-and-pencil measures forbaseline and online measures for follow-ups, which could result invariance because of measurement modality. A third limitationconcerns the use of an undergraduate sample of unknown sexualorientation; nonheterosexual individuals may have found the con-tent irrelevant, and future interventions should target content spe-cifically to sexual orientation. Future research should also examineemotional education interventions in different populations, such assubstance users.
If larger trials support emotional education interventions, future
research may expand intervention content and address additionalanticipatory emotions such as worry, regret, resentment, and trust.In addition, emotional education interventions may potentially beuseful in application to other health behaviors, such as obesity-related behaviors and smoking, for which emotion likely plays acritical role yet is too rarely addressed in behavior change at-tempts.
