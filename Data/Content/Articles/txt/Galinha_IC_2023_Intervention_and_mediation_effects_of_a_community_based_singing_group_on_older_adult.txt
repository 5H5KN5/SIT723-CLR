ABSTRACT
Objective:  To examine short- and long-term effects of a group 
singing program on older adults’ perceived physical and mental 
health levels, and also investigate subjective well-being (life satis -
faction, positive/negative affect and hedonic balance), body bal -
ance and serum biomarkers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate) as putative mediating mechanisms, controlling 
for the cognitive status of the participants. Design : The randomized 
controlled trial included 149 participants (60 to 95 years), allocated 
to an immediate intervention group (IG) or a wait-list active control 
group (WLG). The intervention comprised 34 sessions of group 
singing during 4-months. Main outcome measures : Self-report 
measures of physical health, anxiety, stress, and depression. Blinded 
assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention 
(4 months) and follow-up (6 months). Results : Participants in the 
IG reported a lower decline in perceived physical health after the 
intervention, as compared to the WLG. These benefits were main -
tained at follow-up. Singing-related changes in physical and mental 
health outcomes were mediated via an increase in positive affect. 
Moderation results showed that participants with very low cogni -
tive functioning reported more anxiety and depression symptoms 
after the intervention. Conclusions : These findings provide further 
understanding on the psychological and physical mechanisms and 
effects of group singing in older adults.

2 I. C. GALINHA ET AL.
The last decades have been marked by a global phenomenon of major demographic 
changes in developed countries, characterized by rapid growth in the older adult 
population (Creech et al., 2013 ). Aging is accompanied by gradual but significant 
declines in biological and cognitive functions, with a profound impact on the physical 
and psychosocial functioning of older adults (Fu et al., 2018 ). Consequently, there is 
an increasing scientific interest devoted to the identification of influencing factors of 
the elderly’s quality of life and the testing of evidence-based interventions that con -
tribute to promoting optimal physical and mental health (Clift et al., 2018 ; Fu et al., 
2018 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ). With this in mind, active participation in community-based 
singing groups received increased interest as a potentially effective intervention with 
physical and mental health benefits for older people (Clark & Harding, 2012 ; Daykin 
et al., 2018 ; Livesey et al., 2012 ; Reagon et al., 2016 ).
Singing is an active form of music participation based on the act of music-making 
through physical engagement (Kreutz et al., 2004 ; Reagon et al., 2016 ). More specif -
ically, group singing is a polyphonic social activity that involves using the body to 
produce rhythmic and harmonious sounds in a synchronized way with other people 
(Livesey et al., 2012 ). Group singing is also cognitively challenging, involving remem -
bering or learning songs, focusing on vocal control, watching the music sheet and 
the music conductor, and listening to the other singers during the performance, while 
producing an individual intonation that matches the frequency of the choir (Kreutz 
et al., 2004 ). The multimodal aspects of singing in a community group may also 
include a combination of meaningful opportunities for group work and socialization, 
positive reminiscing, emotional expression, relaxation and enjoyment (Clark & Harding, 
2012 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ).
Several studies have identified diverse well-being and health-related benefits asso -
ciated with choir singing in elderly populations, whereas others have presented 
inconclusive and mixed findings. Available systematic reviews of the literature indicate 
that amateur choir singing has a wide range of benefits for well-being and health in 
community healthy adults (e.g., Daykin et al., 2018 ), and as a therapeutic intervention 
concerning specific health problems (Clark & Harding, 2012 ; Clift et al., 2010 ; Reagon 
et al., 2016 ; Williams et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, when compared to a control group 
or to other interventions, some reviews indicated that group singing participation 
does not provide additional benefits in some health domains (Clark & Harding, 2012 ; 
Clift et al., 2010 ; Reagon et al., 2016 ).
Emotional and mental health benefits associated with group singing
Findings from qualitative and cross-sectional survey studies suggest that regular 
participation in established choirs is linked to emotional and mental health benefits 
such as higher levels of happiness, enjoyment, sense of purpose, self-confidence, 
self-worth and self-control, as well as lower levels of depression, anxiety and isolation 
(Clift et al., 2010 ; Creech et al., 2013 ; Livesey et al., 2012 ). In addition, quasi-experimental 
and randomized controlled trials (RCT) using amateur chorists (Bullack et al., 2018 ; 
Kreutz et al., 2004 ) or individuals assigned to community singing groups (Cohen et 
al., 2006 ; Coulton et al., 2015 ; Pires et al., 2018 ) also reported positive effects of choir 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 3
singing for older people on measures of affect, morale, and mental health components 
of quality of life, anxiety, and depression.
On the other hand, some studies have also documented non-significant or con -
tradictory effects of group singing interventions on emotional and mental health 
dimensions. Two quasi-experimental studies (pre and post-test design) demonstrated 
that group singing programs specifically developed for older people had no beneficial 
effect on depression and quality of life scores (Davidson et al., 2014 ; Fu et al., 2018 ). 
Moreover, when compared to an active music therapy intervention (including listening, 
improvising and dancing to music), the elderly nursing home residents assigned to 
a recreational group singing reported increased depressive symptoms, while the 
participants assigned to a music therapy group perceived significant reductions in 
depression (Werner et al., 2017 ).
With respect to specific effects of group singing on quality of life, one study with 
older adults from a community showed higher levels of psychological, social relation -
ships and environmental quality of life, but not physical quality of life, even after 
adjusting for age and depressive symptoms (Johnson et al., 2013 ). However, when 
compared to matched older adults from the general population, amateur choir singers 
reported higher levels of physical quality of life, but not psychological quality of life 
(Johnson et al., 2017 ).
Physical and physiological benefits associated with group singing
Empirical research has documented the physiological health benefits of singing, namely 
cardiorespiratory, neuroendocrine, and immune systems functioning (Fancourt et al., 
2014 ; Kang et al., 2018 ). Other studies suggested that amateur choir singing contributes 
to several physiological benefits, namely physical stress reduction, distraction from 
pain, more health-seeking behaviors, improved physical fitness, and better respiratory, 
cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune levels (Lally, 2009 ; Livesey et al., 2012 ). Regular 
participation in group singing may provide additional opportunities to engage in light 
to moderate physical activity, through commuting to the rehearsal places and back 
home, physical warm-ups and standing during the rehearsals (Clift et al., 2010 ; 2018 ), 
and contributing to enhance their physical fitness. Conversely, lower levels of physical 
activity or fitness (for example, balance impairment) are related to fear of falling in 
community-dwelling older adults (Sawa et al., 2020 ), and higher stress and anxiety 
symptoms, that may act as risk factors and actual falls in this population (Hallford et 
al., 2017 ). Other studies have also suggested that the physical effects of group singing 
on older adults’ well-being may be mediated by the modulating effects of stress-related 
and inflammatory responses (e.g., Fancourt et al., 2014 ), although other studies have 
not mirrored these effects across all analyzed biomarkers (Bullack et al., 2018 ; Kreutz 
et al., 2004 ). Given these inconsistencies, a specific interest of this study was to simul -
taneously assess two broad-spectrum inflammatory biomarkers, namely the C-reactive 
protein (CRP) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), since previous studies have 
suggested that low-grade systemic elevated inflammation is associated with poorer 
self-rated health/mental health in older adults (Wium-Andersen et al., 2013 ).

Study aims and hypothesis
Despite the diverse health-promoting psychological, social and physical effects associated 
with group singing for older people documented in the scientific literature, there is a 
need for randomized controlled trials using non-established community choirs and the 
follow-up assessment of the group singing effects (e.g., Coulton et al., 2015 ; Pires et al., 
2018 ), in order to better understand the long-term stability and accumulation of the 
intervention-related effects (Dingle et al., 2019 ). Moreover, little experimental research 
has focused on the potential mechanisms (or mediators of change) underlying the 
relationship between choir singing and physical or mental health-related outcomes. To 
the best of our knowledge, the few available studies used a quasi-experimental design 
with a comparison group to determine possible social mediators of group singing-related 
improvements in health and well-being (e.g., Pearce et al., 2016 ) in a wide age range 
of adult samples. As such, there is a need for further research and a better understand -
ing of the possible mechanisms and linkages among psychological and biological pro -
cesses associated with group singing benefits (Gick, 2011 ), especially in older adults.
Therefore, the primary aim of the current study is to examine the short- and long-term 
effects (at follow-up) of a 4-month community-based singing program on older adults’ 
perceived physical health, anxiety, stress, and depression. A secondary aim of the present 
study is to investigate the unique and combined mediation effects of psychological 
(life satisfaction, positive and negative affect, and hedonic balance) and biological/
physical (body balance and serum biomarkers: CRP and ESR) variables on choir-singing 
intervention changes in older adults’ perceived physical and mental health.
Based on previous findings and theoretical considerations (e.g., Dingle et al., 2019 ; 
Kang et al., 2018 ; Williams et al., 2018 ), it was hypothesized that group singing effects 
on older adults’ perceived physical and mental health, compared to a control (waiting 
list) condition, would be significantly mediated by one or more of the above putative 
mediator variables. More precisely, different mediating mechanisms were tested, 
hypothesizing that positive changes in group singing outcomes in older adults are a 
consequence of enhanced life satisfaction, mood/affect regulation, body balance, and 
physiological biomarkers (see the hypothesized parallel multiple mediation model in 
Figure S1  of the supplemental appendix). Taking into consideration the substantial 
inter- and intra-individual variability in cognitive abilities among elderly individuals 
(Institute of Medicine, 2015 ) and how this may influence the perception of the inter -
vention’s benefits, both analyses of variance and mediation were also performed, in 
order to control for the potential moderating effect of cognitive status on the choir 
singing-outcomes relationships.
Materials and methods
Study design and setting
A two-center, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two-arms [immediate 
intervention (IG) and wait-list active control groups (WLG)] and blinded outcome 
assessment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the choir singing intervention 
in older adults. Data was collected at baseline (T0), four months after the baseline 
assessment (T1) and again at the six-month follow-up (T2). Between T0 and T1, 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 5
individuals in the IG participated in the choir singing program, whereas the individuals 
in the WLG were instructed to maintain their daily/usual social and leisure activities 
(i.e., active control group). After the second assessment (T1), individuals in the WLG 
initiated the intervention arm and participated in the choir singing program.
Study participants were recruited from two sites (Lisbon and Almada) of the Santa 
Casa da Misericórdia (SCM) in Portugal. The SCM is a private, non-profit, centenary insti -
tution of public interest that offers various charitable and social support services to senior 
citizens and whose primary mission is to improve the quality of life of the less privileged.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the first author’s university 
research ethics board (ref. n.° 12-09-2018). All procedures performed in this study 
were in accordance with the ethical guidelines and standards of the research ethics 
committee, as well as with the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity and 
the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.
This study was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT03985917), as part 
of a larger research project aiming to investigate the psychosocial, cognitive, and 
health-related benefits of a singing group program for older adults. The current study 
focuses specifically on potential psychological and physical/biological mechanisms 
associated with group singing benefits.
Participants
An a priori power analysis (GPower, version 3.1.9) determined that a target sample 
size of 140 individuals was required to power the study at 90%, with an alpha level 
of .05 and an estimated large effect size (ηp2 = 0.14) for repeated measures analysis 
of variance. A dropout of 15 participants per group (total of 30 individuals) was 
estimated to decrease the statistical power of the study to 83%.
Between October 2018 and January 2019, eligible older adults were invited to 
participate in this research program. To be eligible for inclusion, individuals had to 
be 60 years of age or older, retired, accepting the invitation to enroll in the study 
and not having participated in any type of intervention programs in the previous 
four months. Exclusion criteria included having a severe diagnosed impairment (e.g., 
auditory, visual or mobility-related) that could impede the participation in the 
choir-singing activities.
Of the 1624 individuals who were screened for eligibility, 1371 (84.4%) were found 
to be ineligible and 104 (6.4%) decline to participate for different reasons. The remain -
ing 149 eligible older adults who accepted to participate in the research were ran -
domly assigned to the IG ( n = 75) or the WLG ( n = 74). However, in the first week of 
the intervention, 12 participants of the IG dropped out of the study without attending 
any session. In order to maintain the statistical power of this RCT study, the research 
team decided to randomly select 14 participants from the WLG and allocate them 
into the IG. These 14 participants started their participation on the second week of 
the intervention, missing the two initial sessions. After this, the sample distribution 
included 89 participants in the IG ( n = 45 in Lisbon and n = 44 in Almada) and 60 in 
the WLG ( n = 30 in Lisbon and n = 30 in Almada). The CONSORT flowchart of the 
participants and the study design is presented in Figure S2  (of the supplemental 
appendix).
6 I. C. GALINHA ET AL.
No significant differences were found at baseline between the IG and the WLG 
concerning the sociodemographic and the cognitive status variables (see Table S1  in 
the supplemental appendix). The majority of participants were female, aged above 
70 years, widowed or lived with their partner (married/cohabitation), and had com -
pleted only a few years of formal schooling. A total of 77.9% of all participants (83.1% 
in the IG and 70.0% in the WLG) had one or more diagnosed medical conditions. No 
significant interaction (group conditions × institution sites) or main (institution sites 
- Lisbon and Almada) effects were observed regarding the sociodemographic and 
outcome variables (data available upon request). Altogether, results indicate that the 
sample is characterized by low levels of formal education and household monthly 
income, as well as low scores on cognitive function as measured by the MoCA.
Measures
Sociodemographic data was provided at T0 by the staff of the SCM institution and 
included gender, age, education level (years of educational attainment), marital status, 
socioeconomic status (monthly household income), and diagnosed medical conditions. 
This data was missing on marital status (IG, n = 6; WLG, n = 1), education level (IG, 
n = 5; WLG, n = 1) and socioeconomic index (IG, n = 4; WLG, n = 1).
Psychoemotional and cognitive variables were assessed by questionnaires and 
administered by trained research assistants using Portuguese-language validated 
versions of the instruments [see the study protocol (Galinha, Farinha, et al., 2020 ) for 
more information]. The body balance was assessed by trained research assistants, 
whereas the physiological biomarkers were collected by certified laboratory techni -
cians. All measures were completed or collected, in-person, by independent researchers 
and certified laboratory technicians blinded to group allocation, at the Social Care 
Institution facilities. The blood samples were analyzed by a certified laboratory. Data 
collection took place for 10 weekdays, from 10 to 15 participants per day. It started 
at 8 a.m., while participants were fasting, for: i) biomarkers, respiratory function, and 
balance data collection, followed by a buffet breakfast; ii) cognitive assessment; and, 
after 15 minutes break, ii) psychosocial measurement questionnaires and interviews. 
Every step of the data collection was performed by different researchers.
Outcome variables
Perceived physical health . The self-rated physical health dimension was measured 
using the physical health component of the World Health Organization Quality 
of Life: Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument (WHO, 1996 ). Omega values 
indicated good internal consistency values for this scale, at all assessment points 
(T0 = .77, T1 = .81, and T2 = .77).
Depression, anxiety and stress . The mental health variables were assessed using the 
21-items Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 
1995 ), which is a short version of the original DASS scales comprising three 
subscales (depression, anxiety and stress), each with 7-items. Participants were 
asked to rate the frequency of experienced negative emotions, over the last four 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 7
months, on a four-point response scale. In this study, the scales showed good 
internal consistencies (omega coefficients) at all assessment points: depression 
(T0 = .84, T1 = .87, and T2 = .83), anxiety (T0 = .79, T1 = .84, and T2 = .78), and 
stress (T0 = .82, T1 = .88, and T2 = .86).
Mediating variables
Life satisfaction .  The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985 ) was 
used to assess life satisfaction as a global cognitive appraisal of one’s life. This 
scale includes 5 items which were answered using a five-point Likert scale. The 
SWLS showed good reliability, in terms of omega coefficients, at all assessment 
time points (T0 = .84, T1 = .88, and T2 = .84).
Positive and negative affect .  The Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule 
(PANAS; Watson et al., 1988 ) was used to assess the positive and negative 
affect, as well as the balance between the two dimensions. This scale comprises 
a total of 10 adjective words for positive and 10 words for negative affect. 
Participants were asked to indicate how they generally felt, over the last four 
months, on a five-point Likert scale. Preliminary analyses (correlation and 
principal components) indicated that the item “excited” showed higher inter-
item correlations and factor loadings on the negative affect dimensions at all 
assessment points, irrespective of the participants group. Thus, this item was 
removed from further analysis. The PANAS’ subscales showed good internal 
consistencies (omega coefficients) at all assessment points, namely: positive 
affect (T0 = .80, T1 = .76, and T2 = .85) and negative affect (T0 = .85, T1 = 
.85, and T2 = .88). The affect balance score was calculated by subtracting the 
negative affect scores from the positive affect scores (PANAS’ subscales), with 
total scores range from −4 to 4 and with higher scores representing higher 
levels of overall affective well-being.
Body balance . The timed unipedal stance test was performed to assess the static 
balance. Participants were instructed to stand barefoot on their preferred leg, with 
their eyes open, keeping their legs from touching and maintaining an unipedal 
stance for up to 20  seconds. The duration of the test performed correctly was 
measured using a stopwatch chronometer and the best score of two trials was 
registered and used for analysis (Springer et al., 2007 ).
Serum biomarkers .  The C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
tests are commonly used laboratory tests to monitor and identify inflammatory 
diseases. The C-reactive protein concentrations were determined using the latex-
enhanced immunoturbidimetric method. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels 
were determined in glass capillaries by microphotometry.
In this study, blood samples were collected early in the morning after an overnight 
fasting period. The collection, handling, and processing of these serum samples were 
performed by certified technicians of a licensed laboratory, using standard operating 
and quality control procedures.

Moderator variable
Cognitive function. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005 ; 
Simões et al., 2008 ) is a brief, single-page screening instrument, administered to assess 
the cognitive status of the participants. In the present study, only the MoCA total 
scores were used, with possible scores varying from 0 (worst performance) to 30 (best 
performance). Omega values indicated good internal consistency values for this scale, 
at all assessment points (T0 = .83, T1 = .81, and T2 = .79).
Procedures
Detailed information regarding the study procedures is available in the published 
protocol (see Galinha, Farinha, et al., 2020 ), and is briefly summarized here.
After obtaining the SCM institution’s written agreement, eligible individuals were 
approached and invited by the institution to participate in the research. Interested 
individuals were informed about the study’s terms and conditions and provided signed 
informed consent. A briefing session was provided by the intervention and the research 
teams to inform eligible older adults about the intervention program and research 
study participation. Eligible participants were then randomly assigned, with a 1:1 (IG: 
WLG) allocation ratio and blocking within sites (Lisbon and Almada), using the ran -
domization function in IBM SPSS Statistics software.
The group singing program (Sing4Health) was a 4-months intervention consisting 
of twice-weekly, 34 sessions of 2 hours of duration, and a final public performance 
show. Sessions were conducted by a team of professional choir directors, one of 
which is a professional singer/artist and a public figure. Sessions took place in local 
theatres, intending to promote the mobility of the older adults and a greater contact 
with the local community. The group singing program included several components, 
namely: relation exercises and vocal warm-up; vocal technique exercises; rehearsals 
of the repertoire; breaks of nearly 20 minutes for interaction and socialization purposes; 
and, creation and presentation of a performance show. However, due to the inter -
vention team limitations it was not possible to fully implement the group dynamics’ 
exercises as initially planned. The singing repertoire included Portuguese traditional 
songs (folk and fado ) suggested and selected by the intervention team and the par -
ticipants, after discussion.
Statistical analyses
A preliminary inspection of the dataset was conducted to screen the data for accuracy, 
normality of the distributions and missing values.
All variables, at all assessment points, showed reasonable univariate normality 
(i.e., skewness and kurtosis values between ±2), except for the CRP values. A square 
root transformation was applied, only resulting in a normal distribution for T0 CRP 
values. With respect to CRP values, two (IG, n = 1; WLG, n = 1) severe outliers (i.e., 
CRP values > 6,0) at T1 and one (WLG, n = 1) at T2 were replaced by the winsorizing 
procedure. A square root transformation resulted in acceptable distributions of T1 
and T2 CRP data.
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 9
The missing values analysis indicated 0.3% of missing data at T0, 29.5% at T1, and 
44.3% at T2. However, results of the Little’s missing completely at random (MCAR) 
test showed that missing values appeared to be at least missing at random at T1, χ2 
(281) = 288.46, p = .367, and at T2, χ2 (204) = 211.94, p = .337. Hence, missing values 
at all assessment points were imputed using the expectation-maximization algorithm 
(Dempster et al., 1977 ), using all available data at each assessment time point.
The internal consistency (reliability) of the composite (latent) variables were eval -
uated using McDonald’s omega coefficients, which were estimated using the free 
software JASP , version 0.11.1 (JASP Team, 2019 , Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Descriptive statistics included mean ( M), standard deviation ( SD), mean score dif -
ference (Δ M) between time points (ex. MT0 − MT1) and respective 95% confidence 
intervals (CI), frequency and percentage (%).
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-Square (χ2) tests were used to 
compare group differences (IG vs. WLG) at baseline. In order to investigate the effects 
of the group singing intervention on the outcomes, a series of separate two-way 
(groups × time points) mixed-design ANOVAs were performed. A second series of 
two-way ANOVAs were performed in order to examine the moderating effect of cog -
nitive status (as a continuous variable) on the previous interaction effects. When a 
significant moderation was identified, the conditional effect of group singing inter -
vention on the outcome variables, as a function of the moderator (continuous variable), 
was probed using the Johnson-Neyman (J-N) technique (Hayes, 2018 ). Dependent 
t-tests were used to estimate the follow-up effects only in the IG.
Effect sizes after the first intervention (T1) and at follow-up (T2) were estimated 
using omega squared (ω2) for the ANOVAs and Cohen’s dz for the dependent t-tests, 
and interpreted according to Cohen’s ( 1988 ) suggestion: small (ω2 ≥ .01 and dz ≥ 
0.2), medium (ω2 ≥ .06 and dz ≥ 0.5) and large (ω2 ≥ .14 and dz ≥ 0.8).
Four parallel multiple mediation models (one for each outcome) were tested to 
examine the direct effects of the group singing intervention on the outcomes 
(physical and mental health indicators), the indirect effects through several mediators 
and the related moderated mediation effects. Based on modern mediation analysis 
(Hayes, 2009 ), indirect effects were further tested, even in the absence of statistically 
significant total and/or direct effects, since the indirect effects tend to be estimated 
with higher relative power than the total and the direct effects (Kenny & Judd, 
2014 ). With this in mind, models 4 (mediation only) and 59 (moderated mediation) 
of the PROCESS macro, version 3.4 (Hayes, 2018 ) for the SPSS, were used to compute 
and estimate coefficients for the direct, indirect and conditional effects, as well as, 
to provide bootstrapped CI for the indirect effects. The estimates of the 95% per -
centile CI of the indirect effects were derived from 10000 bootstrap samples. The 
indirect effect was considered significant when zero was not included in the 95% 
CI (Hayes, 2018 ). The percentile bootstrap method was selected given that this 
procedure shows a good balance between type I errors and statistical power ( yzerbyt 
et al., 2018, p. 941).
All analyses, except reliability and effect sizes (JASP), were conducted using the 
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.y ., USA). The level 
of statistical significance was set at p ≤ .05.

Figure S2 . As presented in Table S1  (in the supplementary appendix ), homogeneity 
between IG and WLG was guaranteed at baseline for the participants’ demographic 
characteristics and the outcome variables, all Fs (1, 147) < 1.33, ps > .25 (see Table 
1 for the descriptive statistics).
Of the participants allocated to the IG, 12 dropped out before S1 starting the 
study, 23 participants were considered non-compliers (i.e., attended less than 75% of 
the sessions), and the remaining 54 participants were compliers. With respect to the 
second group (WLG) singing intervention (T1 to T2), 33 older adults agreed to par -
ticipate, with 10 attending less than 75% of the sessions and 23 participating in 75% 
or more sessions.
The main reasons for the participants dropping out included: health issues (personal 
and/or family illnesses, scheduled treatments or operations, recovery from operations, 
etc.); participants had enrolled with friends or spouses that were allocated to a dif -
ferent group; and, scheduling incompatibility with the group singing sessions. Moreover, 
during the six months waiting list period, participants from the WLG enrolled in other 
activities that included singing and dancing in group (popular marches), which led 
to the withdrawal of this intervention.
The attrition rate for the IG was 13.4% at T1 and 34.8% at T2, whereas for the 
WLG it was 20.0% at T1 and 50.0% at T2.
In order to reduce the potential bias related to stemming from missing data, 
the following analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
principle, which includes all randomized individuals (IG, n = 89; WLG, n = 60). In 
addition, per-protocol (PP) analyses were also performed, including the IG compliers 
(n = 54) and the WLG individuals assessed at T1 ( n = 48), or the WLG compliers of 
the second group singing intervention ( n = 23). Since the results of the ITT and PP 
analyses were very similar, the results presented next are based on the ITT analysis, 
whereas the PP results are available in an online supplemental appendix (see Tables 
S2 to S6 ).

Intervention effects on perceived physical health and mental health outcomes
Results of the first series of the two-way ANOVAs (see Table 1 ) showed a significant 
group × time interaction for perceived physical health levels ( p = .045, ω2 = .01, 
observed power = .52), with WLG participants showing a greater decline ( p < .001, 
dz = 0.58) than IG participants ( p < .001, dz = 0.32). No significant group × time 
interactions were found for anxiety, stress, and depression ( ps > .27). When controlling 
for the potential moderating effect of cognitive status on the choir singing-outcomes 
relationships, results of a second series of two-way ANOVAs (see Table 2 ) showed that 
the MoCA total scores did not moderate the group × time interaction for perceived 
physical health and stress, but significantly moderated the group × time interactions 
for anxiety ( p = .039, ω2 = .01, observed power = .55) and depression ( p = .020, ω2 
= .01, observed power = .65). The J-N technique was used to identify the cognitive 
function levels where these conditional effects were significant (see Figures S3  and 
S4). Results showed that the intervention had a detrimental effect on anxiety and 
depression levels, but only among IG participants with very low cognitive functioning 
(MoCA total scores of ≤ 12.97 and of ≤ 7.92, respectively).
Follow-up effects on perceived physical health and mental health outcomes
Given that only the IG participants were assessed at 6-months after the intervention, 
the follow-up effects were examined using the IG within-subjects’ comparisons from 
T1 to T2. Results show that all outcome variables at T1 remained unchanged at 
follow-up (see Table 3 ), except anxiety ( p < .001, dz = 0.49) that decreased from the 
post-intervention to the follow-up period.

Mediation effects of group singing intervention on perceived physical and 
mental health outcomes
The direct and indirect effects of the group singing intervention on the physical and 
mental health outcomes, after controlling for baseline values, are presented in Table 
4. Separate parallel multiple mediation analyses were performed for affect balance, 
after removing positive and negative affect variables from these models, and the 
pattern of results maintained between models.
No significant direct effects ( c’-paths) were observed between the group singing 
intervention and the outcomes. The mediation results showed significant effects 
(a-paths) of group singing intervention on the mediating variables positive affect and 
affect balance, indicating that these variables increased in the IG participants signifi -
cantly more than in the WLG participants. In addition, several significant effects 
(b-paths) were observed linking the subjective well-being variables (life satisfaction 
and positive/negative affect) and the outcomes, although not as a result of the inter -
vention. More precisely, perceived physical health was significantly predicted by all 
subjective well-being variables, anxiety and stress were predicted by negative affect 
and affect balance, and depression was significantly predicted by all affective dimen -
sions. Furthermore, higher body balance predicted lower scores of anxiety and stress, 
whereas higher CRP levels predicted higher stress scores. Significant indirect effects 
(ab-paths) between group singing intervention and the outcomes were only observed 
via positive affect. More precisely, the group singing intervention had significant 
indirect effects on perceived physical health, anxiety, stress, and depression levels, 
through preserving a better hedonic (affect) balance, as well as on perceived physical 
health and depression levels through higher positive affect scores. The four tested 
models explained 64% to 74% of the variance of the outcome variables, namely: 
perceived physical health, R2 = .74, F(14, 134) = 27.34, p < .001; anxiety, R2 = .64, 
F(14, 134) = 16.86, p < .001; stress, R2 = .73, F(14, 134) = 25.22, p < .001; and, depres -
sion, R2 = .68, F(14, 134) = 20.38, p < .001.
Moderated mediation effects of group singing intervention on perceived 
physical and mental health outcomes
Conditional process results showed no significant interaction effects of cognitive status 
on any of the a-, b - and ab-path relationships. Moreover, the other significant effects 
observed in the parallel multiple mediation analyses were unmoderated on levels of 
cognitive status. However, when considered the analyses of the direct ( c’-paths) effects, 
results showed that the elderly’s cognitive status moderated the relationship between 
group singing and depression levels, c’= −0.183, SE = 0.078, p = .020, 95% CI [−0.338, 
−0.029]. Using the J-N technique, results indicated that the intervention had a detri -
mental effect on depression scores, but only among those with very low cognitive 
functioning levels (MoCA total scores ≤ 12.68).
Discussion
The main objectives of this study were to examine the intervention effects of a 
non-established community-based singing program on older adults’ perceived physical

health, anxiety, stress and depression levels, and also to investigate whether subjective 
well-being (life satisfaction, positive/negative affect and hedonic balance) and/or 
physical health variables (body balance, CRP and ESR) mediated the choir singing-related 
changes in the outcome measures. The invited older adults that participated in the 
current study were mostly women, aged above 70 years, with lower education levels 
and with one or more diagnosed diseases.
Group singing intervention effects
With regards to the intervention effects on the physical and mental health outcomes, 
a key finding of the current study shows that the group singing program contributed 
to mitigate the declines in perceived physical health (in comparison to the control 
group), but not to decrease anxiety, stress and depression. This evidence supports 
previous research on the perceived physical health benefits of group singing (Cohen 
et al., 2006 , 2007 ; Johnson et al., 2017 ; Lally, 2009 ; Livesey et al., 2012 ; Pearce et al., 
2016 ) and corroborates previous studies that did not report benefits in anxiety, stress 
and/or depression levels related with group singing activity (Davidson et al., 2014 ; 
Werner et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, these results do not concur with other find -
ings that documented better mental health (e.g. increased psychological well-being 
and lower levels of distress, anxiety and depression) due to group singing (Clift et 
al., 2010 ; Reagon et al., 2016 ; Williams et al., 2018 ), including those of a RCT study 
(Coulton et al., 2015 ) that indicated lower scores of anxiety and depression, but no 
significant effects on the perceived physical health, after 3 months of choral singing 
participation. Possible explanations for these differences include different study 
designs, intervention programs, assessment instruments and sample characteristics.
The high retention rate (86.6%) and the percentage of participants who attended 
to 75% or more sessions of the first intervention (70.1%) suggests that the older 
adults in the IG showed interest and willingness to engage in the community choir, 
which may be understood as an indication of the feasibility and acceptability of this Intervention → M→ Depression ab −0.121 −0.529 0.276 ― −1.128 to −0.056

singing group program (Coulton et al., 2015 ). On the other hand, the current study 
also showed that the randomization procedure and four months of waiting period 
for the WLG participants has caused some dropouts. For example, some participants 
had enrolled with friends or spouses that were allocated to a different group, were 
not willing to be randomized to a waiting-list control condition or enrolled in other 
singing groups. With this in mind, the use of a stepped wedge cluster design may 
provide a more viable alternative to the WLG condition (Dingle et al., 2019 ), especially 
for older adults from the same institution site and that intended to share the program 
participation experience with friends and/or spouses.
A limited number of studies have also addressed and examined possible negative 
experiences and effects associated with amateur choral singing (e.g., Kreutz & Brünger, 
2012 ). In line with this issue, moderated results in this study indicated that, alongside 
the previously mentioned benefits, participation in the group singing program was 
also found to induce higher levels of anxiety and depression, but only among older 
adults with diminished cognitive functioning. Studies that only included older adults 
with cognitive impairment/dementia showed that previous choir singing interventions 
had mixed effects, with some indicating benefits in terms of social relationships, sense 
of purpose and personal growth (e.g., Tamplin et al., 2018 ), whereas other studies 
reported a deterioration in depressive symptoms (Werner et al., 2017 ). Given previous 
findings and the results of this study, it is suggested that choir singing interventions 
for cognitively impaired elderly individuals should occur within more individualized 
(smaller groups) and flexible settings, as in the case of group music therapy. This 
framework is expected to help address individualized needs and abilities of the par -
ticipants, as opposed to larger choir settings which pose higher demands and more 
potential stressors in singing instructed songs in a coordinated way with people with 
different cognitive abilities (Dingle et al., 2019 ; Werner et al., 2017 ).
Follow-up effects of the group singing intervention
Taking into consideration the results of the long-term effects, it was also found in this 
study that the group singing intervention benefits were sustained at 6-month follow-up. 
Moreover, between post-intervention and follow-up, significant reductions in anxiety 
were also observed in the IG. Given that some variability in the follow-up outcomes 
should be expected (Cohen et al., 2006 , 2007 ), it is not possible to determine if these 
changes are the direct result of potential delayed intervention effects or if they are 
specifically associated with the aging process. However, both the maintenance of the 
short-term intervention-related effects and the follow-up improvements on the outcomes 
suggest accumulated health-related benefits for the IG individuals, after participating 
in the group singing program, especially when considering the characteristics of the 
current sample. Nevertheless, more research is needed regarding the psychological and 
physiological dynamics associated with group singing for older adults over time.
Mediation effects of group singing
After identifying the direct effects of the choir singing intervention on the outcomes, 
another aim of this study was to test and understand the potential ‘generative’  
16 I. C. GALINHA ET AL.
mechanisms and linkages between group singing and the older adults’ perceived 
levels of physical health, anxiety, stress and depression. Results of the parallel (mul -
tiple) mediation analyses showed that the singing intervention had significant indirect 
effects on the perceived physical and mental health outcomes, but only through some 
psychological mediators, namely affect balance and positive affect. The remaining 
psychological (life satisfaction and negative affect) and physical/physiological mediators 
(body balance, CRP and ESR) showed no significant mediating effects on the choir 
singing-outcomes relationships.1 Additionally, when controlling for these indirect 
pathways, the significant effect of group singing on the perceived physical health 
was no longer significant, thus indicating indirect-only mediation. As such, these 
results provide new insights into the identification and understanding of the particular 
importance of the mechanisms responsible for the transmission of group singing 
benefits on physical and mental health outcomes.
Taken together, these findings suggest that an increase in positive affect experi -
enced by the participants during the group singing intervention leads to increased 
hedonic well-being, which in turn leads to higher levels of perceived physical health 
and reduced anxiety, stress and depression symptoms. These findings confirm previous 
studies suggesting that choral singing activities and experiences are associated with 
better affective regulation (Bullack et al., 2018 ; Kreutz et al., 2004 ; Pires et al., 2018 ), 
and extend it by demonstrating that positive affect balance is a primary mechanism 
through which group singing benefits operate on health perception and depression 
in older adults. As such, the current study shows that improved mood regulation due 
to choral singing promotes better perceived physical and mental health in elderly 
individuals, and that this mediating mechanism was not conditional on the cognitive 
status of the participants. A possible explanation for the absence of significant direct 
effects in the mediation models tested for this sample of older adults, may lie on 
the duration of the intervention, which may have been insufficient for the beneficial 
effects of the group singing program to be transmitted to the physical and mental 
health outcomes. Therefore, future studies should attempt to investigate potential 
dose-response relationships between the number/duration of the group sessions, the 
mediating effect of (positive) hedonic balance and the related outcomes.
On the other hand, and contrary to expectations (Fancourt et al., 2014 ; Kang et 
al., 2018 ; Lally, 2009 ; Livesey et al., 2012 ), the singing program had no mediation 
effect through the physical and physiological variables (for more details on the direct 
effects on physiological variables, see Galinha, Pinal, et al., 2021 ). Possible explanations 
for these findings may include the diverse and heterogenous characteristics of our 
sample in terms of age (young and very old), education and socioeconomic levels 
(low), cognitive functioning (low to high), physical fitness (low) and the presence of 
several diagnosed diseases. Moreover, but contrary to initially planned in the research 
protocol, it was not possible to fully implement the group dynamics’ exercises, which 
were expected to further promote both social and physical/physiological benefits. 
More precisely, the intervention team (maestro and pianist) tended to shorten this 
part of the sessions and focused more in the singing activity. Furthermore, the fact 
that this intervention was based on a non-established singing group may suggest 
the need for a longer intervention period, given that the short-term related effects 
tend to be more associated with social and/or emotional outcomes (Bullack et al., 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 17
2018 ). Noteworthy, but not as direct result of the group singing intervention, this 
study also showed beneficial effects of life satisfaction on physical health and depres -
sion scores, a positive relationship between CRP and stress, as well as inverse asso -
ciations of body balance with anxiety and stress levels. These findings are consistent 
with prior research on the same-aged population (Hallford et al., 2017 ; Sawa et al., 
2020 ; Wium-Andersen et al., 2013 ), and emphasize the pertinence and relevance of 
studying these variables as potential explanatory mechanisms of the group 
singing-induced changes in the older adults’ physical and mental health (Dingle et 
al., 2019 ).
Study strengths and limitations
Study strengths include the recruitment of a diverse community-based elderly sam -
ple, the use of an RCT design, the evaluation of an intervention based on a 
non-established choir, the simultaneous assessment and analysis of self-report and 
biological measures, and the analysis of follow-up data. Study limitations include 
the weaker implementation of the group dynamics’ exercises as initially defined in 
the research protocol and the loss of participants at follow-up. Dropouts in studies 
and RCTs with older adults is a well-documented issue, particularly of waiting-list 
participants (Dingle et al., 2019 ). The sample of our study was drawn from a par -
ticular population, from a social care institution, different from the usually studied 
samples of younger older adults whose enrollment in the singing group was their 
own initiative. This sample includes younger and advanced aged older adults with 
concomitant health and cognitive function issues. It includes a majority of low 
educative and socioeconomic status participants, typically less interested in cultural 
programs. Moreover, this sample’s participants did not take the initiative to enroll 
the program, but were invited. Nevertheless, results from general population samples 
are needed to test the efficacy of singing group programs in a wider spectrum of 
participants.
Conclusion
In summary, the results from this study suggest that group singing for older adults 
contribute to mitigate the declines in perceived physical health levels in comparison 
to the control group (WLG). These benefits were maintained at 6-month follow-up. 
In addition, results of the mediation analyses showed that the positive influences of 
choir singing on physical health, anxiety, stress and depression levels were better 
explained by indirect-only effects through increase of positive affect. On the other 
hand, moderation results also indicated that participation in the group singing pro -
gram was associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms, but only 
among participants with diminished cognitive functioning.
Taken as whole, these findings highlight the psychological and physical effects, 
and mediational mechanisms of choral singing in a large, demographically and cog -
nitively diverse sample of older adults, invited to a singing group. Nevertheless, future 
research should further test these findings on the interplay of psychological, social 
18 I. C. GALINHA ET AL.
and physiological effects of group singing for older adults, taking into consideration 
the participants’ characteristics, as cognitive function, education and physical 
health status.
