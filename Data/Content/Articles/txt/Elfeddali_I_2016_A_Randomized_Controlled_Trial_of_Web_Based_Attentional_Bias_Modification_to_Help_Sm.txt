Objective: To assess the efficacy of a multiple-sessions Web-based Attentional Bias Modification (ABM)
self-help intervention in 434 smokers who made a quit-attempt. Method: Respondents were randomized to
receive 6 sessions of ABM- or placebo-training in a period of 2 weeks. Smoking-related cognitions (e.g.,self-efficacy and intention to quit) and cognitive biases (i.e., attentional and approach bias) for smoking-cueswere assessed before training (pretest). Primary outcome-variable was continued abstinence, 6 months afterbaseline. Bias reduction at the posttraining assessment was the secondary outcome. A 2 /H110032 mixed analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression analyses were conducted using the whole sample ( N/H11005434) as
well as subsamples of light to moderate smokers ( /H1102115 cigarettes, N/H11005115) and heavy smokers (15 or more
cigarettes, N/H11005319). Conservative analyses (coding drop-outs as smokers) as well as complete case analyses
were conducted. Results: The ABM training had no significant effect regarding bias reduction and no
behavioral effects in the whole sample of smokers. Subsample analyses revealed a significant positive effecton continued abstinence in heavy smokers only (complete case analyses: odds ratio [ OR]/H110053.15; p/H11005.02;
confidence interval [CI] /H110051.24–7.99; conservative analyses: OR/H110052.49; p/H11005.02; CI /H110051.13–5.48).
Conclusion: Web-based ABM training is ineffective in fostering cognitive bias reduction and continued
smoking abstinence. However, the positive effects in heavy smokers—as indicated by exploratory subsampleanalyses—warrant further research into the potential of multiple sessions ABM training to foster continuedsmoking abstinence in heavy smokers who make a quit-attempt.

Smoking is one of the main preventable causes of premature
death and disability with a high economic and social burden ( CDC,
2008 ;Gelder, Poos, & Zantinge, 2011 ). Although most smokers
are aware of the negative consequences of smoking and want toquit smoking, only 3–5% manage to remain abstinent for sixmonths or longer ( Hughes, Keely, & Naud, 2004 ). Smoking re-
lapse prevention programs—mainly using behavioral techniquesand skill trainings—have shown only modest effects ( Hajek,
Stead, West, Jarvis, & Lancaster, 2009 ). This underlines the need
for new interventions to support smokers who want to quit smok-ing.Dual-process models (e.g., Bechara, 2005 ;Deutsch & Strack,
2006 ;Strack & Deutsch, 2004 ;Wiers et al., 2007 ;Wiers & Stacy,
2006 ) propose that behavior is determined by the joint outcome of
reflective cognitive processes on the one hand, and impulsivecognitive-motivational processes, on the other hand. Impulsiveprocesses are fast, associative, and triggered automatically. Thelatter processes are sensitive to the incentive salience of cues andresult in cognitive biases such as attentional bias ( Field & Cox,
2008 ;Robinson & Berridge, 2003 ;Robinson & Berridge, 2008 )
and approach bias ( Field, Kiernan, Eastwood, & Child, 2008 ;
Robinson & Berridge, 2008 ;Wiers, Rinck, Dictus, & van den

Wildenberg, 2009 ) for cues related to the addictive behavior. In the
past decade, many studies have assessed these cognitive biases andtheir relation to behavior (meta-analysis; Rooke, Hine, & Thor-
steinsson, 2008 ). An attentional bias is observed when someone’s
attention is selectively drawn by a category of cues (e.g.,addiction-related cues). An approach bias is observed when some-one demonstrates an automatically triggered action-tendency toapproach addiction-related cues rather than a tendency to avoidthem. Both biases have been demonstrated in smokers (e.g., Cox,
Fadardi, & Pothos, 2006 ;Mogg, Bradley, Field, & De Houwer,
2003 ;Waters, Shiffman, Bradley, & Mogg, 2003 ;Watson, de Wit,
Hommel, & Wiers, 2012 ).
More important, implicit cognitive processes cannot only be
assessed, but they can also be directly manipulated, using tech-niques collectively referred to as Cognitive Bias Modification(CBM). In their pioneering study, MacLeod and colleaguesadapted a version of the Visual Probe Task (VPT)—a measure-ment of attentional bias—to modify attentional bias for threat-related stimuli in students with medium levels of anxiety, eithertoward or away from threat stimuli, and found effects both on thebias and on behavior ( MacLeod, Rutherford, Campbell, Ebswor-
thy, & Holker, 2002 ). The first studies in the domain of addiction
tested the effects of a single-session of Attentional Bias Modifi-cation (ABM) and showed that an attentional bias for alcohol(Field et al., 2007 ;Schoenmakers, Wiers, Jones, Bruce, & Jansen,
2007 ) and smoking ( Attwood, O’Sullivan, Leonards, Mackintosh,
& Munafo, 2008 ;Field, Duka, Tyler, & Schoenmakers, 2009 )
could be modified toward or away from the substance-related cues.However, training effects were only observed on trained pictures:no generalization was found, neither “close generalization” (i.e.,decreased bias toward untrained substance-related pictures whenmeasured with the same task), nor more distant generalization(e.g., other cognitive biases or behavior). Distant generalizationeffects of one specific training to other cognitive biases are acurrent topic in CBM research (see for a review Wiers, Gladwin,
Hofmann, Salemink, & Ridderinkhof, 2013a ). These generaliza-
tion effects are important because behavior is mostly determinedby multiple cognitive biases—as mentioned above both an atten-tional bias and an approach bias have been related to smoking—and it is an important question whether these biases can be targetedwith a single type of training or if separate training-strategies arewarranted. The most important generalization of training is tobehavioral outcomes.
More encouraging than the effects of the single-session inter-
ventions, the first two studies on multiple-session ABM trainingfor problem drinkers ( Fadardi & Cox, 2009 ) and alcohol-
dependent patients in treatment ( Schoenmakers et al., 2010 ) did
result in a decreased bias when measured with untrained stimuli(i.e., close generalization effects) and in reduced drinking ( Fadardi
& Cox, 2009 ) and later relapse ( Schoenmakers et al., 2010 ). In the
smoking domain, however, a recent study showed no baseline biasand no effects of multiple sessions of ABM on either attentionalbias or smoking behavior ( Begh et al., 2015 ). In contrast, another
study in the smoking domain found that three sessions of ABMreduced attentional bias, but did not result in changes with regardto smoking outcomes ( Lopes, Pires, & Bizarro, 2014 ). Comparable
findings from a study by Kerst and Waters (2014) pointed out that
three sessions of ABM provided on mobile devices significantlychanged the attentional bias for smoking, but had no effects onbehavior. The latter study was conducted among smokers without
a desire to change their behavior, supporting the idea that motiva-tion to quit could be an important condition for behavioral effects(cf.Wiers et al., 2013a ,2015 ). For this reason it was judged crucial
to preselect smokers who actually made a quit attempt in thepresent study.
A final topic concerns the delivery mode of ABM training. The
Internet has shown to be a promising delivery mode for health-promoting interventions (see, for instance, Brug, Campbell, & van
Assema, 1999 ;Elfeddali, Bolman, Candel, Wiers, & de Vries,
2012 ;Te Poel, Bolman, Reubsaet, & de Vries, 2009 ;Vandelanotte,
Spathonis, Eakin, & Owen, 2007 ;Walters, Wright, & Shegog,
2006 ). However, recent studies on social anxiety found no effects
of Internet-delivered ABM training ( Boettcher, Berger, & Ren-
neberg, 2012 ;Boettcher et al., 2013 ;Carlbring et al., 2012 ), which
contrasted with more positive findings for ABM strategies deliv-ered in a clinical setting for the same disorder ( Amir, Beard, Burns,
& Bomyea, 2009 ;Schmidt, Richey, Buckner, & Timpano, 2009 ).
Further testing of the efficacy of Internet-delivered ABM inter-ventions is important, both for theoretical reasons (can a disorder-related attentional bias be successfully modified over the web) andfor practical reasons, especially for smoking, where relatively fewpeople receive formal treatment.
Based on the foregoing discussion, the present study aimed to
test whether six sessions of ABM training delivered over theInternet would result in reduced attentional bias and induce moredistant generalization effects regarding approach bias and successin quitting. It was hypothesized that, compared with placebo-training, the ABM-training would: (a) result in a significantlylarger reduction of attentional bias (assessed both with trainedstimuli, and with untrained stimuli); (b) generalize to influence anapproach bias for cigarettes (distant generalization); and (c) fostercontinued smoking abstinence. Because an attentional bias has
been associated with the quantity and frequency of use, with somestudies revealing significantly greater bias among heavy users(Field, Mogg, Zetteler, & Bradley, 2004 ;Mogg & Bradley, 2002 ;
Townshend & Duka, 2001 ) and others reporting greater bias
among lighter users (e.g., Hogarth, Mogg, Bradley, Duka, &
Dickinson, 2003 ;Mogg, Field, & Bradley, 2005 ;Waters et al.,
2003 ), it was considered necessary to further explore this by means
of subsample analyses. The baseline bias and the effects of thetraining were, therefore, also explored for light to moderate andheavy smokers separately, with heavy smoking defined as smokingat least 15 cigarettes per day (following Rodu, Plurphanswat, &
Fagerström, 2015 ;Waters et al., 2003 ;Wilson, Parsons, & Wake-
field, 1999 ).
Method
Sample Size Calculation
Power calculations (power .80; p/H11021.05) were based on the
assumption to find an abstinence rate of 5% in the control condi-tion and 15% in the ABM condition, and suggested that 132smokers per condition should be recruited. Assuming an attritionrate of at least 20%, we aimed to include 325 smokers in oursample.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Recruitment and Inclusion
Recruitment started in December 2009 with ads on online na-
tional news pages referring to a website. The website explainedthat we had developed a training program to help smokers remainsmoke-free after a quit-attempt and that the efficacy of the trainingwas being tested (vs. a placebo program). The respondents werenotified that they had a 50% chance to be assigned to the placebotraining. The website also explained the inclusion criteria.
Inclusion criteria included giving consent for participation, be-
ing 18–65 years, reporting smoking on a daily basis for at least 1year and not having made a quit-attempt yet (thus, respondentswho did not smoke in the previous week and/or the previous 24 hrwere excluded from analyses). Furthermore, participants needed toselect a quit-date at baseline. Participants met the exclusion criteria
when they did not understand (ability to read and write) Dutchwell, when they consumed more than 16 standard units of alcoholper week (10 g of pure alcohol in the Netherlands), when they wereunable to refrain from alcohol use during a whole day, when theyregularly used drugs or calming medicines, when they reportedhaving a psychological disorder or dyslexia and when they werecolor blind and/or vision impaired (even with glasses). The criteriawere assessed with yes/no questions (e.g., “Are you color blind?”;“Do you have a psychological disorder (e.g., a depression, psy-chosis, schizophrenia, etc.)?”; “Do you use soft or hard drugs?”).The question about the ability to read and write Dutch (“Whatwould be your evaluation of your knowledge (i.e., ability tounderstand, read and write) of the Dutch language?”) had fiveanswering categories (very bad, bad, average, good, or very good).Participants also needed to fill in the baseline questionnaire and theVPT task (because randomization took place after entering thistask). Participants further needed to confirm their quit-attemptafter their quit-date; otherwise, they were excluded from furtherparticipation. Furthermore, respondents who participated in noneof the ABM/placebo sessions were excluded from analyses; sodoing had no substantive impact on the findings reported below.The enrollment and inclusion of respondents is presented in Figure
1. The final analytical sample consisted of 434 respondents.
Design and Procedure
The website contained a link to the program where respondents
could sign up for participation by creating their own user account.The account was used for all sessions, the sessions were Webbased and invitations and reminders were sent by e-mail. The studywas a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two condi-tions: an ABM training condition and a control condition (placebo-training, which consisted of continued assessments). The studyflow was as follows:
1. The respondents started with a pretraining assessment
with a self-report questionnaire in which they were alsoasked to select a quit-date, a manikin-task to measureapproach-avoidance biases and a VPT to measure atten-tional biases (see below for details). The respondentswere randomized into one of the two conditions by meansof a computerized randomization mode after entering theVPT;2. The respondents needed to confirm their quit-attempt
after the chosen quit-date (they were asked if they hadquit for 24 hr on their chosen quit-date and could answer:[a] yes; [b] no, but I am still planning to quit; or [c] no,and I am not planning to quit). Respondents could selecta new quit-date when they chose Option 2; they wereexcluded from further participation when they chose Op-tion 3.
3. Respondents who confirmed the quit-attempt (by choos-
ing Option 1) started with the VPT-based training orplacebo sessions. These training/placebo sessions started18 hr after the respondents entered the previous sessionand closed after 60 hr; this time frame was used for all ofthe training and placebo sessions.
4. A posttraining assessment (i.e., manikin and VPT tasks)
followed the intervention sessions.
5. An Assessment of continued smoking abstinence fol-
lowed 6 months after baseline.
Measures
Self-report questionnaires. Demographic and smoking-behavior
related information was gathered by assessing age, gender, educational
level, the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and the number ofyears one has been smoking and previous quit-attempts. Level of
dependence was measured by six items based on the abbreviated
Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND; Fagerstrom,
Heatherton, & Kozlowski, 1990 ;Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker,
& Fagerstrom, 1991 ).Craving was assessed (cf. Dijkstra & Bor-
land, 2003 ) with six items (e.g., “I desire smoking a cigarette”)
rated on a 5-point scale from 1 /H11005never to (5) very often .
Based on previous studies ( Dijkstra & de Vries, 2000 ;Hoving,
Mudde, & de Vries, 2006 ;Mudde, Willemsen, Kremers, & de
Vries, 2006 ;Te Poel et al., 2009 ) we assessed intention to quit
smoking by one item (”how strong is your intention to quit smok-
ing?”) rated on a 10-point scale from (1) very weak to (10) very
strong ; and self-efficacy by 14 items asking whether the respon-
dent thought to be able to refrain from smoking in various high-risk situations (e.g., at a party or when being angry), rated on a7-point Likert scale from (1) totally disagree to (7) totally agree .
The Attention Control Scale measured two components of at-
tention (attention focusing and attention shifting) with 20 items(e.g., “even when I am working very hard, I get distracted bythings that happen in my environment”) rated on a 4-point scalefrom (1) almost never to (4) always .
Continued abstinence after 6 months was defined as not smok-
ing at all after the quit-attempt (cf. Hughes et al., 2003 ). The
respondents were asked whether they had smoked since theirchosen quit-date and could answer (1. yes; 2. no).
The mean scores were included in the analyses and all scales
had a good reliability, Cronbach’s /H9251/H11022.80.
Materials. We used eight sets of 12 matched smoking—
related (e.g., smoking people, cigarette [packages], etc.) and neu-tral (e.g., nonsmoking people, pencils [packages], etc.) picturepairs for the VPT: Sets 1 and 2 in the pretraining, Sets 2–8 in the
training/placebo sessions, and Set 1 (untrained pictures) in theThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

posttraining. Eight neutral/neutral picture pairs formed practice/
filler trials. Each picture had a dimension of 425 /H11003282 pixels.
For the manikin-task we used 14 matched smoking-related and
neutral picture pairs: another four picture pairs formed practicetrials. Each picture had a dimension of 352 /H11003288 pixels. The
manikin-task consisted of other pictures than the pictures used inthe VPT.
Reaction time paradigms. Approach-avoidance bias was as-
sessed with a manikin task ( De Houwer, Crombez, Baeyens, &
Hermans, 2001 ;Mogg et al., 2003 ). Smoking-related and neutral
pictures were presented one by one on the computer screen, witha manikin appearing above or below (50–50%) the pictures. Therespondents were instructed to either move the manikin toward (inthe “approach block”) or away (in the “avoid block”) from thesmoking-related picture. Respondents were instructed to respondquickly, to make as few mistakes as possible, and to use the letters
‘I’ (for moving up) and ‘V’ (for moving down). The eight practicetrials after the instruction were followed by an approach and avoidblock; the order of the blocks was counterbalanced across respon-dents. A correct response was followed by the next picture (with anintertrial interval of 1,500 ms); an incorrect response was followedby a red cross and a repetition of the trial to ensure serious taskperformance (cf., Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003 ). Each block
presented 28 trials, all pictures were presented once in each block.Response times (RTs) were logged for all respondents.
Attentional bias was assessed with the VPT ( MacLeod,
Mathews, & Tata, 1986 ). Critical trials (actual measurement trials)
presented smoking/neutral pictures pairs, while practice trials
(for practicing with the keys) and filler trials (for reducing thefrequency with which critical trials appear in the task) were Registered for participation (N=2351)

formed by neutral/neutral pairs. The VPT-trials started with a
fixation cross for 500 ms followed by a matched picture pair,after 500 ms a probe (in this case an arrow) replaced one of thepictures. Respondents were instructed to identify the directionof the arrow as quickly and correct as possible by using theletters S (pointing up) and L (pointing down). Error responseswere followed by an identical trial. The pretraining assessmentstarted with eight practice trials (that were repeated until acorrect response was given in all trials) followed by two blocksboth consisting of 12 filler trials and 48 critical trials (repeatingtwo sets of 12 pictures four times). The arrow appeared equallyoften behind the smoking-related and neutral pictures. Theposttraining procedure was identical to the pretraining proce-dure.
Intervention
The training and placebo-training were both based on the VPT
and included six sessions, each with eight practice trials and sixblocks; 48 assessment trials in Block 1, 48 critical trials (actualtraining trials) and 12 intermeasure trials in Block 2–5 and 48critical trials in Block 6. The assessment trials in the interventionsessions were included to reduce the frequency with which criticaltrials appeared in the task; they were not included in the analyses(cf.,MacLeod et al., 2002 ).
In the placebo-training (control condition), the arrow replaced
the smoking-related and neutral pictures equally often (continuedassessment). For training, a contingency was introduced with thearrow replacing the neutral picture in all critical trials, in 50% ofthe Block 1 trials (continued assessment) and in 50% of theintermeasure trials; thus, the arrow replaced the neutral picture in92% of the trials over Blocks 2–6 (cf., MacLeod et al., 2002 ).
Respondents were instructed to identify the direction of the arrowas quickly and accurately as possible by using the letters S (point-ing up) and L (pointing down). The number of trials included wasbased on a previous multiple—session ABM training for abstinentalcohol-dependent patients ( Schoenmakers et al., 2010 ).
Data Analyses
Baseline differences were assessed using /H92732-tests for categorical
variables and ttests for continuous variables. Attrition analyses
were conducted by means of logistic regression analyses. VPT-data were used to calculate median RTs (cf., MacLeod et al., 2002 ;
Schoenmakers et al., 2007 ) when the probe replaced smoking-
related pictures and when it replaced neutral pictures (per respon-dent). Attentional bias was calculated by subtracting the medianRTs for probes replacing smoking-related pictures from the me-dian RTs for probes replacing neutral pictures, a positive scoreindicated a bias toward smoking-related pictures. An approach-bias for smoking related cues was calculated by subtracting themedian approach RTs from the median avoidance RTs, a positivescore indicated an approach bias.
One sample ttests were conducted to assess pretraining biases.
Cognitive bias scores were subjected t o a 2 (time: pre or post-
test)/H110032 (condition: ABM or control condition) mixed analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with time as the within subjects factor andcondition as the between subjects factor. Logistic regression anal-yses—complete case analyses as well as conservative analyses(including drop-outs as relapsers)—were conducted to assess be-
havioral effects after 6 months. The hypotheses were tested at thetwo-sided 5% significance level.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Pretraining demographic and smoking-related characteristics are
presented in Table 1 . The majority of the respondents were women
(69%), the average age was 41 years ( SD/H1100511.04) and the average
consumption was 18 cigarettes per day ( SD/H110057.63). The majority
(92%) of the respondents had made previous quit-attempts.
Adherence and Attrition
On average, the respondents ( N/H11005434) participated in 3.8
sessions ( SD/H110051.95); 194 respondents (45%) participated in 1–3
sessions and 240 respondents (55%) participated in 4–6 sessions.Among respondents who filled out the posttraining measurement(N/H11005210) the average dose was 5 sessions ( SD/H110051.11); 18 (9%)
participated in 1–3 sessions and 192 (91%) participated in 4–6sessions. Dose-response associations could not be assessed be-cause of the imbalance between the “low-dose (1–3 sessions)” and“high-dose (4–6 sessions)” group. The number of sessions fol-lowed did not differ significantly between the control and ABMcondition ( p/H11022.20).
The study drop-out rate after six months in the control group
(71.0%) was not significantly different from drop-out in the ABMgroup (67%); drop-out was related to being younger, lower cravinglevels, and being male.
Data Preparation
Data were excluded because of (a) technical errors/closing tasks
(VPT data: 0.4% of the data, manikin task: 1.2%); (b) respondentsfilling out the measurements multiple times (VPT: 4.1%, manikintask: 4.1%, data from the premeasurement for which the quit-attempt was confirmed were included); and (c) error trials, iden-tical trials after error trials and trials with RTs /H11021200 ms
and/H110222,000 ms (note that trials from the manikin task were
excluded when the RTs /H110223,000 ms; VPT: 7.0%; manikin task:
12.6%). Five respondents had an outlying ( /H110223SDs different from
the group’s mean) attentional bias score at baseline; their baselinedata were excluded from the baseline analyses and the ANOVA(note that the exclusion of these respondents did not result in adifferent pattern of significant results). One ABM respondent hada posttraining attentional bias score of more than 7 SDs lower than
the other respondents in the ABM group; these data were notincluded in the ANOVA (note that they would have biased theresults in favor of the training). At the pretraining assessment ofthe manikin task, 1 respondent had no pretraining data, 8 respon-dents had valid RTs on less than half of the trials ( /H110217 trials) for the
approach or avoid assignment, and 11 respondents had outlyingbias scores ( /H110223SDfrom the group’s mean). Additionally, one
respondent had an outlying bias score at the postmeasurement.

approach bias was 45.77 ( SD/H11005200.85), indicating that the sample
of smokers was faster in reacting when the arrow replaced the
smoking related pictures and when the smoking related picturesneeded to be approached. A ttest against zero revealed that the
bias differed significantly from zero (attentional bias: t(428)/H11005
2.34, p/H11005.02; approach bias: t(413)/H110054.64, p/H11021.001).
Subgroup analyses showed that this significant bias was onlyfound in the group of heavy smokers (attentional bias: t(314)/H11005
2.65, p/H11005.08; approach bias: t(301)/H110055.18, p/H11021.001), while
the bias was nonsignificant in light to moderate smokers. At-tentional bias did not differ significantly between light to mod-erate and heavy smokers, t(427)/H11005/H11002 1.32, p/H11005.19, while
approach bias was significantly stronger among heavy smokers,t(412)/H11005/H11002 2.28, p/H11005.02.
Effects of the ABM training on reducing cognitive biases.
The mixed 2 /H110032 ANOVA (conducted for trained pictures as well
as for untrained pictures) showed no significant main effects oftime nor condition on attentional bias and no significant interactioneffect condition
/H11569time ( p/H11022.15), indicating no significant changes
in attentional bias scores in the whole sample from pre- to post-
training. Subsequent exploratory subsample analyses among lightto moderate and heavy smokers also revealed no significant effects(p/H11022.15).
With regard to approach bias the ANOVA revealed a significant
main effect of time in the whole sample and in the subsample ofheavy smokers (whole sample: F(1, 205) /H110054.77, p/H11005.03; heavy
smokers: F(1, 138) /H110056.70, p/H11005.01, a nonsignificant ( p/H11022.15)

/H11569time inter -
action effect (in the whole sample as well as the subsamples).Continued Abstinence 6 Months After the Pretraining
In the whole sample, the effect of the ABM training (adjusting
for the effects of age, gender, FTND score, and craving levels) hada nonsignificant effect on abstinence (complete cases: odds ratio[OR]/H110051.86; p/H11005.11; confidence interval [CI] /H110050.87–3.96;
conservative analyses: OR/H110051.60; p/H11005.14; CI /H110050.86–3.00). The
interaction term condition by smokers’ group that was added in thesecond block was significant (complete cases: OR/H11005.19;p/H11005.04;
CI/H11005.04–.95; conservative analyses: OR/H11005.24;p/H11005.04; CI /H11005
.06–.92), indicating that the effect of the training was significantlydifferent between light to moderate and heavy smokers.
Simple slope analyses conducted to explore the subgroup effects
showed a significant positive effect of the ABM training onabstinence in heavy smokers (complete case: OR/H110053.15; p/H11005.02;
CI/H110051.24–7.99; conservative analyses: OR/H110052.49; p/H11005.02; CI /H11005
1.13–5.48), with no significant effects in light to moderate smok-ers. To assess if the effects were robust to different definitions of
heavy smoking, additional subgroup analyses–in which the defi-nition of heavy smoking was based on the median consumption(median /H1100519 cigarettes per day, with heavy smoking defined as
smoking at least 19 cigarettes per day)–were conducted: ABM hada (borderline) significant effect in this subsample of heavy smok-ers (complete cases: OR/H110053.91; p/H11005.02; CI /H110051.20–12.71;
conservative analysis: OR/H110052.43; p/H11005.07; CI /H11005.93–6.37), but
not in the subsample of light to moderate smokers. Mediation ofthe behavioral effects by change on implicit cognitive biases wasnot assessed, because of the lack of significant effects regardingbias reduction. Table 2 presents the abstinence rates, stratified by
smokers’ group.Table 1

Discussion
This study evaluated the effects of six sessions of Web based,
self-help ABM-training in supporting smokers with their quit-attempt. Training effects were tested in relation to attentional bias,approach bias (distant generalization) and 6 months continuedsmoking abstinence. The study further explored the effects of theABM training in the subsamples of light to moderate smokers andheavy smokers, separately.
First, in line with other studies (for review see Cox et al., 2006 ),
our results demonstrated a statistically significant attentional biastoward smoking-related pictures among smokers. It should benoted, however, that this bias was modest, as it comprised only acouple of milliseconds. However, previous studies have indicatedcomparable bias levels among heavy smokers ( Begh et al., 2015 ;
Waters et al., 2003 ). While the bias was reliable in the study by
Waters et al., it was nonsignificant in the study of Begh et al. Thelack of significance in the latter study may be related to the samplesize of the study (that was smaller when compared with the studyby Waters et al., and our present study). Exploratory subsampleanalyses further revealed that attentional bias was present in heavysmokers but not in light to moderate smokers. Moreover, themultiple-session ABM training did not result in a significantreduction of attentional bias compared with the control group. Thismay be related to the low reliability of the dot probe task(Schmukle, 2005 ), or it could indicate that attentional bias for
smoking stimuli is hard to change. The latter is also supported bya recent study on multiple sessions of ABM, which showed nosignificant effect with regard to attentional bias; this study, how-ever, found no baseline bias ( Begh et al., 2015 ). Another expla-
nation could be related to the design we used. Until now, mostsmoking-related ABM studies were not Web based but lab-based.One of these studies failed to find a significant decrease in atten-tional bias when compared with a control group ( McHugh, Mur-
ray, Hearon, Calkins, & Otto, 2010 ), while two other studies
resulted in a significant decrease in bias ( Attwood et al., 2008 ;
Lopes et al., 2014 ). It should be noted that the studies by McHugh
et al. and the study by Attwood et al. used a single session ofretraining. Moreover, in the study by Attwood et al., approachtraining was compared with avoidance training instead of a con-tinued assessment control group; this creates a large differencebetween the two conditions and increases the possibility of finding
an effect on the bias (cf., Wiers et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, the bias
was assessed directly after the training session, while our mea-surement was at least 18 hr after the start of the last trainingsession. Hence, it is possible that stronger effects would have beenfound when assessed directly after the training. We did not do this,however, because this assessment could have interfered with thetraining effect (cf., Eberl et al., 2013 ;Wiers et al., 2011 ).
Second, the results indicated that Web based, multiple-session
ABM training was ineffective in fostering continued abstinence inthe whole sample of smokers, while exploratory subgroup analysesrevealed the potential for heavy smokers only (with no significanteffects in light to moderate smokers). The overall behavioralfindings in our sample are in line with those of Begh and col-
leagues (2015) who tested the added effect of five sessions of
ABM (or control-training) as an adjunct of smoking treatment in119 heavy smokers and found no effects of ABM on smokingoutcomes. Lopes, Pires, and Bizarro (2014) tested 89 smokers in
four conditions: (a) no training, (b) three sessions of placebo-training, (c) one ABM session and two placebo-training sessions,and (d) three ABM sessions. The smokers did show an attentionalbias for smoking, which was subsequently reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by ABM (longer lasting changes with moreactive ABM). However, no effects on smoking behavior werefound. We note that our study included a larger sample of smokersper condition compared with the latter study, which may have resulted
in a stronger statistical power to detect effects in the subsample of heavy
smokers. Further, the combined effects are generally in line withmoderation hypotheses of CBM, which state that an effect can onlybe found when there is a bias to begin with, a pattern of resultsobserved in anxiety ( Clarke, Notebaert, & MacLeod, 2014 ;Kuck-
ertz et al., 2014 ), and in alcoholism ( Eberl et al., 2013 ). From a
clinical perspective, it would be tempting to only assign patients toa specific form of CBM when they score high on that particularcognitive bias. However, assessment of these biases is far fromsuited for this purpose at the moment (see Wiers, Gladwin, &
Rinck, 2013b , for further discussion).
Third, our study confirmed that smokers also have a significant
approach-bias for cigarette-related stimuli (see for a review Wat-
son et al., 2012 ). The ABM training had no significant effect onTable 2

modifying this approach bias, suggesting that ABM does not
generalize to an approach bias and that the inclusion of othertraining strategies such as approach-bias retraining may be neededto ameliorate the clinical outcomes. In this context, a study fromthe alcohol-domain may be relevant, which found no correlationbetween attentional bias and approach bias after placebo, but didfind a strong correlation after two drinks ( Schoenmakers, Wiers, &
Field, 2008 ). Perhaps also in smoking, attentional and approach
bias get synchronized only in a craving-induced state and that onlythen generalized effects from the one training to the other can bereached. Furthermore, the manikin task has—when compared withthe Approach Avoidance Task (AAT)—a more explicit character,because respondents are instructed to react on the contents of thepictures, while in the AAT, they react to a contents-irrelevantfeature of the picture (e.g., the format, landscape or portrait; Wiers
et al., 2009 ). Although the manikin task has a good reliability (see
Wiers et al., 2013b ), the AAT task may have yielded different
results with regard to approach bias. However, a recent study usinga novel task to assess both attentional and approach bias foralcohol, found that both predicted unique variance in drinking(Sharbanee, Stritzke, Wiers, & MacLeod, 2013 ), adding to the idea
that the two processes are distinguishable and should be retrainedseparately (see also Sharbanee et al., 2014 ). In alcohol-dependent
patients, retraining an approach bias for alcohol has generatedpositive effects, including increased abstinence 1 year after treat-ment discharge ( Eberl et al., 2013 ;Wiers, Eberl, Rinck, Becker, &
Lindenmeyer, 2011 ). Note that these effects were on top of clinical
“treatment as usual” in an abstinence-oriented program. In thesmoking domain, Wittekind and colleagues (2015) found positive
effects in comparison with a no-training control group, and Kong
and colleagues (2015) found in a placebo-controlled study that
adding AAT-training to a cognitive–behavioral therapy programfor smoking cessation in adolescents produced better 7-day pointprevalence abstinence at statistical trend level, compared withplacebo-training. Hence, there are some first hints that AAT-training might also have some effect in smoking cessation, but thishas yet be confirmed.
Although the present study yielded interesting results, it is also
subject to limitations. First, the many inclusion and exclusioncriteria may impede the generalizability of the results ( Britton et
al., 1998 ). However, exclusion criteria such as excessive alcohol
use, psychological disorders and vision impairments may be nec-essary, because of their possible influence on RTs. Second, thestimuli used were matched based on visual matching, while moreelaborate standardization and validation of the stimuli before taskdevelopment may have been a more suitable approach, becausefeatures of stimuli, such as complexity, can influence the cognitivebias ( Miller & Fillmore, 2010 ). Third, we only used a 500 ms
stimulus onset asynchrony in the present study, which does notallow us to differentiate between speeded detection and delayeddisengagement. This approach was chosen because Schoenmakers
et al. (2010) only found a training effect for 500 ms, and we did not
want to make the Internet-based training overly long. Fourth,smoking status was based on self-report, which may have intro-duced bias. However, the SRNT ( Society for Research on Nicotine
& Tobacco ;Benowitz et al., 2002 ) subcommittee on Biochemical
Verification has stated that biological verification is not required in
large-scale population-based studies with limited face-to-face con-tact and studies where the data are collected by mail, telephone, or
Internet.
A fifth limitation is that we did not assess whether respondents
were aware of the condition to which they were assigned. Previousstudies ( Beard, Weisberg, & Primack, 2012 ;Schoenmakers et al.,
2010 ) showed that the large majority of respondents both in the
active and in the control ABM conditions think that they have beenassigned to a control group, which consequently may impede theirmotivation to participate. The latter may also be related to the highdrop-out rates that also formed a limitation in the present study.However, high drop-out rates are common in Internet trials ( Etter,
2005 ;Eysenbach, 2005 ;Tate & Zabinski, 2004 ;Te Poel et al.,
2009 ), and drop-out did not differ between the conditions (indi-
cating that respondents may not have been aware of the conditionthey were assigned to). Nevertheless, drop-out can bias the resultsof analyses and future studies on how to prevent drop-out inInternet-trials are recommended. This could be done by adding amore explicit module to the intervention to motivate the participantto plan the quit-attempt and to make coping plans (cf., Wiers et al.,
2013a ). Alternatively, training may be made more attractive by
introducing game-elements ( Boendermaker, Prins, & Wiers,
2015 ). Sixth, the effects in heavy smokers were based on explor-
atory subsample analyses. Subsample analyses are subject to bi-ases and caution is needed with interpreting the results. Moreover,the sample size of light smokers ( N/H11005115) and the heavier
smokers ( N/H11005319) was unbalanced, which may have influenced
the results for instance by means of power issues in the lightsmokers group. However, the results can help us to direct futureresearch to test the effects of ABM for heavy smokers.
Another limitation is formed by the definition of heavy smoking
(at least 15 cigarettes per day), because this definition does notcover all definitions used in the literature (see Schane, Ling, &
Glantz, 2010 , for a review). Additional analyses in which the
definition of heavy smoking was based on the median consump-tion (at least 19 cigarettes per day) indicated that the effects maybe robust to different definitions because they remained significantin the complete case analyses (note that they became of borderlinesignificance in the conservative analyses). More research on theeffects in heavy smokers is, however, recommended. Finally,respondents who did not make a quit-attempt were not included inthe main behavioral analyses, while analyzing by intention-to-treatentails including all respondents as randomized regardless ofwhether or not the intervention was received ( Heritier, Gebski, &
Keech, 2003 ;Hollis & Campbell, 1999 ). The latter approach is,
however, a conservative approach that may be susceptible to TypeII errors, because it also includes respondents who did not receivethe intervention ( Heritier et al., 2003
;Hollis & Campbell, 1999 ).
Therefore, a modified approach has been used more frequently inthe last decades ( Abraha & Montedori, 2010 ), because it seems to
be more suitable to gain insight into the effects of interventionsamong those who actually followed them.
In conclusion, this study suggests that Web based multiple-
session ABM training is unsuccessful in changing cognitive biases,but that the training may have potential to help heavy smokers whomade a quit-attempt to reach continued abstinence. Because themost promising conclusions were based on exploratory subsampleanalyses, further confirmatory research is needed to draw firmconclusions on the effects of ABM training for heavy smokers.Moreover, challenges for future studies are to gain further insightsThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.
