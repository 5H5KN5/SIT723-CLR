Abstract
Background: Physical activity has many physical and mental health benefits and can delay the development of
disability in older age. However, uptake of this health behaviour is sub-optimal in women in their middle and older
age. This trial aims to establish the acceptability and feasibility of the Active Women over 50 programme involving
online information, telephone health coaching and email or SMS support to promote physical activity behaviour
change among women aged 50 years and over.
Methods: Sixty community-dwelling women who are insufficiently active according to national guidelines, will be
recruited and randomised to 1) receive the Active Women over 50 programme or 2) a wait-list control. Active Women
over 50 is a 3-month physical activity programme guided by behaviour change science, providing access to a
website, one telephone-delivered health coaching session from a physiotherapist and 8 email or 24 SMS messages.
The primary outcome is the proportion of participants at 3 months post-randomisation who would recommend
participation in the programme to another person like themselves. Secondary outcomes are feasibility measures:
rates of recruitment, retention, completeness of outcome data and uptake of telephone support; and intervention
impact measures: accelerometer-assessed average steps/day, proportion of participants meeting national guidelines
on moderate to vigorous physical activity; and questionnaire-assessed quality of life, exercise perceptions, mood,
physical functioning and self-reported physical activity. Intervention participants will also complete a follow-up
survey to assess impressions of the intervention and adoption of strategies for physical activity participation. Data
will be analysed descriptively to guide the design of a larger trial. Between-group differences in secondary
outcomes will be used to estimate effect sizes for sample size calculations for a fully powered randomised
controlled trial.

Background
Physical inactivity is a significant but modifiable public
health problem. Globally, it is associated with 5.3 million
deaths [ 1] and has an economic cost of INT$67.5 billion
per year [ 2]. Physical inactivity is as important a risk fac-
tor for developing chronic disease and disability as
smoking and obesity [ 3].
There is compelling evidence of the benefits of phys-
ical activity for physical and mental health at all ages [ 3]
and maintenance of independence in older age [ 4].
Regular physical activity can prevent or help manage
some health conditions and has been reported to delay
disability by up to 15 years in older women [ 4]. The na-
tional guidelines for physical activity recommend Aus-
tralian adults to accumulate 150 to 300 min of
moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 min of vigorous-
intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination
of both moderate and vigorous activities each week, and
to do muscle-strengthening activities on at least 2 days
each week [ 5]. Achieving the national guidelines for
physical activity in middle age has longevity benefits re-
gardless of baseline physical activity [ 6].
Physical activity participation is sub-optimal in women
in their middle age and very low in older women. Sixty-
five per cent of women over the age of 55 years and 80%
of women over the age of 75 years do not participate in
sufficient regular physical activity to gain health benefits
[7]. While some women become more physically active
with retirement [ 8] this may be too late to prevent dis-
ability in older age. By 2023, Australian women will be
retiring at an older age with access to the senior pension
age increasing to 67 years [ 9]. Commencement of suffi-
cient regular physical activity before retirement therefore
needs to be a priority and maintained in the long term
to promote independent and healthy ageing.
Barriers to physical activity participation for women
are unique. The 2014 national survey showed that
women have higher sedentary time and greater carer re-
sponsibilities than men [ 10,11]. These barriers, coupled
with the demands of paid work and low confidence for
participating in physical activity in the absence of a pre-
vious habit, place women in their middle-age years par-
ticularly at risk of being insufficiently physically active to
maintain good health. This population would benefitfrom a targeted and supported evidence-based approach
to increase their physical activity in a way which is
achievable and sustainable.
Health psychology uses a variety of tools and behav-
iour change techniques that can be made available to
middle-aged women to support them to increase their
levels of physical activity and to maintain these levels in
the long term. A theoretical basis incorporating the self-
determination theory (SDT) [ 12] and Behaviour Change
Wheel and COM-B system model of behaviour [ 13] shed
light on key factors necessary for the initiation and
maintenance of physical activity [ 14]. SDT considers an
individual ’s motivation behind the choices they make by
addressing competence, autonomy and psychological re-
latedness, and the COM-B system model of behaviour
considers an individual ’s capability, opportunity and mo-
tivation to achieve behaviour change. Key factors of SDT
and COM-B include plentiful resources (psychological
and physical), effective self-regulation, maintained mo-
tivation to be active, positive habits and positive environ-
mental and social influences. Effective behaviour change
interventions often include techniques that tap into
these behavioural factors. For instance, resources in the
form of health information and programme information
provides an individual with physical capability and com-
petence; goal setting, self-monitoring, action and coping
planning support self-regulation and opportunities for
behaviour change; relatable peer role models stimulate
motivation; using habit formation techniques help to de-
velop automaticity forming positive responses to con-
textual cues; and supporting development of positive
habits, i.e. increasing physical activity and reducing sed-
entary behaviour [ 15–17].
Behavioural interventions can be delivered digitally, via
web and smartphone, in order to increase scalability for
population-level impact [ 18]. eHealth online interven-
tions using web, email and SMS-based platforms have a
number of advantages over face-to-face interventions,
especially where they can be delivered to mobile phones:
they have wide reach, comparatively low cost of imple-
mentation and delivery, and flexibility of intervention
use at times and location convenient for the user [ 19,
20]. Mobile phone access to websites, video, email and
short message service (SMS) provides a portable,Wallbank et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:91 Page 2 of 13
everyday use context for receiving eHealth messages,
promoting higher engagement and adherence [ 21,22].
There is emerging evidence supporting the use of SMS
to promote health behaviour [ 23], and including email
reminders to prompt participants ’health behaviour
change [ 24]. One disadvantage of online interventions is
potential disengagement as people prefer the persona-
lised nature of face-to-face interactions. To address this,
effective interventions often include phone or video ses-
sions with a health coach who guides the participants,
provides social support and tailors behaviour change
techniques to participants ’abilities and preferences, sup-
porting participants ’autonomy, in line with SDT. A re-
view of health coaching has shown a beneficial effect on
physical activity [ 25], so including a skilled health coach
with an online intervention is likely to increase engage-
ment and consequently the effectiveness of the interven-
tion. To date, there are limited programmes that flexibly
support middle-aged women in becoming more active
and staying active for life which can be implemented at
scale. Online behavioural interventions augmented by
health coaching provide a potential scalable solution to
the current problem of inactivity among this age group.
This trial aims to establish the acceptability and feasi-
bility of the Active Women over 50 programme, a 3-
month programme comprising online information, tele-
phone health coaching and follow-up email or SMS sup-
port to promote physical activity behaviour change
among women aged 50 years and over.
Methods/design
Trial design
We will conduct a feasibility pilot study using a rando-
mised controlled trial (RCT) with wait-list control. The
CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CON-
SORT) flow diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1. This trial has
been designed according to the CONSORT statement
[26] and will be reported according to the Standard
Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional
Trials (SPIRIT) statement [ 27], and with reference to the
Template for Intervention Description and Replication
(TIDieR) checklist [ 28] in Table 1.
Eligibility criteria
Women are eligible for inclusion in the trial if they
are aged 50 years and over, and community-dwelling
residents in New South Wal es, Australia. Potential
participants will be excluded if they have limited
English language skills, do not have access to the
internet, have a medical condition that precludes par-
ticipation in regular physical activity or are already
sufficiently active in accordance with Australian phys-
ical activity guidelines [ 5].Recruitment
Participants will be recruited through advertising in
newsletters and websites of community organisations,
university and local health districts, via the study recruit-
ment website, www.activewomenover50.org.au , word-of-
mouth and social media. Participation is cost-free and
no incentives are offered for participation. Potential par-
ticipants will be screened for eligibility via an online sur-
vey. Recruitment commenced 3 May 2019, and at the
time of submission of this manuscript, 66 participants
had been recruited, 56 randomised and 0 participants
had completed follow-up measures.
Randomisation
Following confirmation of eligibility and completion of
informed written consent and the baseline measures, par-
ticipants will be randomly allocated by a research assistant
to the intervention or control group in equal numbers
using computer-generated randomisation. Allocation will
be determined using concealed allocation, via a random-
isation schedule embedded in a secure web-based software
platform, REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)
[35,36] hosted at The University of Sydney, Australia. A
variable block randomisation schedule will be prepared
from a computer-generated list of random numbers by a
researcher not involved in participant recruitment.
Intervention group
The intervention is described by the TIDiER checklist
(in Table 1). Intervention components and choice of be-
haviour change techniques were informed and under-
pinned through integration of the Behaviour Change
Wheel and COM-B system model of behaviour [ 13],
SDT [ 12] and user input from a convenience sample of
women in the target population. Examples of interven-
tion functions and behaviour change techniques (BCTs)
used in the Active Women over 50 intervention are
shown in Table 2. The Active Women over 50 interven-
tion was developed following our previous trial [ 38] in-
vestigating an information and support intervention with
a 3-month follow-up period to enhance physical activity
in university and health service-employed women over
50 years of age. The feedback from participants indicated
a need for more support (manuscript under prepar-
ation). The intervention group will receive access to the
Active Women over 50 website plus one telephone con-
sultation with a research physiotherapist trained in
health coaching, plus either 8 email or 24 SMS follow-
up motivational messages over a 3 month period.
Intervention participants will receive access to the Ac-
tive Women over 50 website (Fig. 2) via a web address
and will be asked not to share the website to avoid study
contamination. The website will deliver content via three
main webpages namely, “Why be Active? ”,“How to beWallbank et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:91 Page 3 of 13
Active ”and “Be Inspired ”.T h e “Why be active? ”web-
page will emphasise the importance of becoming active
from middle age for maintenance of health and physical
function and prevention of falls in older age. The Active
Women over 50 website content will include evidence-
based information about the impact of even small in-
creases in physical activity on health and longevity. The
“How to be active ”webpage will include practical sug-
gestions on becoming more active and guidance on the
setting of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
Realistic and Time-related) goals and self-assessment of
barriers to physical activity participation and solution
generation as key behaviour change techniques. The
website will link to external sources of support/information, such as the NSW Ministry of Health-
funded Get Healthy free health coaching service [ 39]
and the Active and Healthy online directory [ 30]o f
physical activity opportunities. The website will also pro-
vide suggestions of resources and internet applications
supporting behaviour change and habit formation, and
other links for information about physical activity for
different health conditions and services available.
The “Be inspired ”webpage will include inspirational
video case studies of “success stories ”of four “real-
life”women aged over 50 who have managed to in-
crease their physical activity levels in the face of mo-
bility, health or practical difficulties and the benefits
that they have experienced. To stimulate motivationFig. 1 CONSORT flow diagram for the pilot and feasibility study Active Women over 50Wallbank et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:91 Page 4 of 13
and provide an interactive element to the website,
there will also be the opportunity for participants to
share their own ideas and inspirational stories via
the website. Frequency of use of the Active Women
over 50 website will be at the discretion of the
participant.Participants will receive one telephone health coaching
consultation, which will occur within 2 weeks of random-
isation. The consultation session will facilitate goal setting
and physical activity behaviour change, using evidence-
based theoretically informed behaviour change principles.
Health coaching will be provided by a tertiary-trainedTable 1 Intervention description using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [ 28] for Active

2. Why Physical activity has many physical and mental health benefits, including the delay of developing disability in older
age. Yet the uptake of this health behaviour is particularly low in older women and sub-optimal in working women
in their middle age. While commencement of regular sufficient physical activity in middle-age years needs to be a
priority for healthy ageing, women over 50 years have unique barriers to becoming more active (e.g. higher sedentary
time, greater carer responsibilities, work demands). Behavioural interventions delivered remotely and digitally via web,
email and SMS platforms offer wide reach and provide flexibility of intervention use at times and location convenient
for the user. Telephone health coaching can also be delivered remotely and provides tailoring of the intervention to a
person ’s abilities and preferences. A theoretical basis incorporating the Behaviour Change Wheel and COM-B system
model of behaviour, Social Determination Theory has been used to design the intervention and choice of behaviour
change techniques. The intervention targets barriers unique to women over 50 and will incorporate the behaviour
change techniques including goal setting, problem-solving, action and coping planning, review of behavioural goals,
self-monitoring, social support and social comparison, information provision, persuasion about capability and habit
formation to facilitate and sustain behavioural change.
3. What materials Participants will have access to the internet.
The website will be accessed by the internet and will provide 1) information for the benefits of physical activity
including links specific to women, different health conditions and ages; 2) resources and strategies for how to
become physically active including a pre-exercise screening tool and exercise intensity guidelines [ 29], guide on
getting started, internet-based programme resources such as the Active and Healthy website [ 30],parkrun website
promoting free, weekly community walk/runs [ 31], links to sporting groups and suggestions of smartphone
applications; 3) inspirational stories of people becoming physically active including professionally produced video
case study interviews of four real-life female women aged over 50 who have overcome barriers to increase their
physical activity; and 4) the opportunity for participants to share their own ideas and inspirational stories via the
website.
Participants will also receive their choice of either 8 email messages or 24 SMS messages embedded with behaviour
change techniques that will link back to and reinforce the website content and provide further motivation to increase
their physical activity. Participants will also receive one telephone health coaching session with a trained research
physiotherapist trained in physical activity behaviour change techniques.
4. What procedures Access to the intervention website will be provided to participants upon randomisation to the intervention group.
Participants will be asked not to share the website to avoid contamination. Participants will also be given the choice
to receive either 8 emails or 24 SMS messages over the 3-month study period, and a mutually agreed time will be
made for the health coach to contact the participants within 2 weeks of receiving access to the intervention. The
health coach will document behaviour change techniques used in the telephone session. All participants will have
email access to the trial manager for any further enquiries.
5. Who provided The study manager will provide participants with access to the website, regular messages and liaise appointment
times with the health coach.
Health coaching will be provided by a tertiary-trained physiotherapist employed by the study with research
experience delivering telephone-based health coaching. The coach will have completed courses through Wellness
Coaching Australia [ 32], HealthChange Australia [ 33] and Medicoach [ 34] in motivational interviewing and behavioural
intervention techniques.
6. How Participants will be notified by email upon randomisation to the intervention group and will gain access to the
intervention website via a web address. Frequency of accessing the website will be at the discretion of the participant.
The email will also give participants the choice to receive regular messages via email or SMS and will ask for available
times when the health coach may contact them. The health coach will be provided with participants ’available times,
contact, demographic and current physical activity details by the study manager.
7. Where Participants will access the intervention via the internet and telephone at a location of their convenience.
8. When and how much After participants are given the intervention website address, they have access to the website at any frequency
they choose. The regular email or SMS messages link back to the website to support behaviour change with the
reinforcement of information and suggested strategies. The health coaching telephone call will be made within
2 weeks of accessing the intervention. There will be no cost to participate.
9. Tailoring All participants will receive the same online resource (website and email or SMS messaging content), but the
opportunity to talk with a health coach will allow for tailoring to individual ’s preferences, needs and circumstances
so that physical activity can be adopted and maintained. Participants will be advised to seek individual advice from
a health professional if they are concerned about commencing physical activity or have an injury.Wallbank et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:91 Page 5 of 13

Control group
Participants randomised to the control group will be
waitlisted to receive access to the Active Women over
50full programme after the 3-month follow-up data
collection period.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome will be participant acceptability of
the intervention and study methods. A global measure
will assess whether participants would recommend par-
ticipation in the study to someone else like themselves.
Participants will be asked to select “yes”or“no/unsure ”
to the question “Would you recommend the Active
Women over 50 study to another person such as your-
self? ”at 3 months post-randomisation.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes will measure the feasibility of the
study methods and intervention and the impact of the
intervention. Feasibility will be evaluated with process in-
dicators at 3 months post-randomisation using study re-
cords to measure the 1) rates of recruitment assessed by
the proportion of people screened who met the inclusion
criteria and proportion of eligible people who agreed to
participate in the study; 2) representation of sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of participants screened and con-
senting to participate in the study; 3) retention of
participants assessed by the number of participants who
withdraw consent or participation; 4) mode by which
people heard about the study; 5) completeness of outcome
data assessed by accelerometer and survey questionnaire
outcome data; 6) uptake of telephone health coaching
consultation with the research physiotherapist, assessed by
the proportion of intervention participants who make an
appointment with the research physiotherapist health
coach; 7) uptake of the Active Women over 50 website re-
source, assessed by the proportion of intervention partici-
pants who used the website, the website content that was
accessed and the intensity of website usage, measured by
Google Analytics; and 8) engagement with the email mes-
sages, assessed by the proportion of intervention partici-
pants who open the automated email messages sent by
secure email marketing website Vision6 [40]. Records will
be kept when different aspects of the intervention are of-
fered, delivered and received by each participant.
Intervention impact will be measured via a question-
naire and Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer, as detailed
below, at 3 months post-randomisation assessing 1) the
average number of steps taken per day (accelerometer
measured), 2) the proportion of participants taking part inat least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per
week or at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity physical ac-
tivity per week (as recommended by the Australian Phys-
ical Activity Guidelines) [ 5] (accelerometer measured), 3)
exercise perceptions as measured by the Exercise Benefits
and Barriers Scale [41], 4) mood as measured with the
positive and negative subscales of the Positive and Nega-
tive Affect Schedule [42], 5) self-reported physical activity
as measured by the International Physical Activity Ques-
tionnaire [43], 6) physical functioning as measured by the
function component of the Late Life Function and Dis-
ability Instrument [44], and 7) health-related quality of life
as measured by the EQ-5D-5 L survey [ 45].
Data collection procedure
Both the questionnaire-based measures and
accelerometer-measured physical activity will be com-
pleted at baseline and repeated at 3 months post-
randomisation. Data will be assessed or extracted by a
research assistant blinded to group allocation. Question-
naires will take approximately 30 min to complete and
will be accessed via an online survey link ( REDCap [36])
or sent in hardcopy by post, as preferred by the
participant.
The intervention group will complete an additional
questionnaire at 3 months post-randomisation to assess
their impressions of the intervention, perceived benefits
and barriers, adverse events, usage of goal setting and
their physical activity plans following the intervention.
The questionnaire will ask both open- and closed-ended
questions, for example “Did you set yourself a physical
activity-based goal during the study? ”and “What, if any-
thing, helped you to achieve your goals? ”An email or
phone call will be sent to any participants with incom-
plete outcome measures to improve data completeness
and participant retention.
Objectively measured physical activity
Actigraph GT3X+ is able to accurately estimate how
physically active a person is throughout the day by
measuring 3D body accelerations and is a valid instru-
ment that has been extensively researched in the phys-
ical activity and public health field [ 46]. Participants will
wear the Actigraph (GT3X+) for 7 consecutive days dur-
ing waking hours (except during water-based activities
or bathing). The accelerometer will be posted to partici-
pants with instructions for usage, along with an activity
calendar to complete over the 7-day period and a pre-
paid envelope for returning the device to the research
team. Activity counts will be collected at a sampling fre-
quency of 30 Hz and reintegrated to 60-s epochs for data
analysis. Accelerometer data will be manually checked
against participant activity calendars to verify wear time,
and erroneous data will be excluded prior to analysis.Wallbank et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:91 Page 10 of 13
Data management
To ensure participant confidentiality, the final dataset
will contain re-identifiable information only. All study
data will be entered onto a password-protected database
and maintained on a firewall-protected local network
server at The University of Sydney. Paper files will be
stored in a locked filing cabinet in the Chief Investiga-
tor’s office. The database and paper files will only be
accessed by study staff. All publications associated with
the results of the study will involve de-identified data, so
participant confidentiality will be maintained.
Analysis of outcomes
Feasibility outcomes will be analysed descriptively to
guide the design of a larger trial. Accelerometer data will
be analysed using ActiLife 6 software with time spent in
different activity intensity levels calculated using the
Troiano 2008 cut-points [ 47]. Acceptable wear time will
be defined as at least 4 days with 10 h or more per day
of valid wear time. Periods of 90 min or more of con-
secutive zeros (indicating non-use) will be considered as
non-wear time.
Odds ratios will be calculated to assess the acceptabil-
ity and feasibility of the study on the dichotomously
scored primary outcome (the likelihood a participant
would recommend participation in the study to someone
else such as themselves) to assess the effect of group al-
location on the dichotomously scored secondary out-
come (proportion of people achieving physical activity in
accordance with national guidelines) [ 5], adjusting for
baseline scores. The study methods will be considered
feasible if at least 80% of all participants complete
follow-up measurements, or 80% of intervention partici-
pants access the intervention website or participate in
the telephone health coaching session. Intervention ver-
sus control group differences in secondary outcomes,
analysed with general linear models adjusting for base-
line scores, will estimate effect sizes for sample size cal-
culations for a larger trial and will provide an indication
of likely intervention effect. This will be the progression
criteria for proceeding to a fully powered randomised
controlled trial.
Apvalue of < 0.05 will be considered statistically sig-
nificant. Analyses will be pre-planned, conducted while
masked to group allocation and will use an intention-to-
treat approach. Analyses will be conducted using the
Stata 14 software package.
Sample size justification
There will be 60 community-dwelling females aged 50
years and over recruited for the pilot trial [ 48], allocated
in equal numbers to the intervention and control
groups. This sample size will provide feasibility data andestimates for sample size calculations for planning a fu-
ture fully powered trial [ 49].
Ethics and dissemination
The trial protocol has been approved by the Human Re-
search Ethics Committee at The University of Sydney,
Australia (approval number 2019/075). The trial was
prospectively registered (ACTRN12619000490178, 26
March 2019). Results will be disseminated via peer-
reviewed journal articles and international conferences,
and a lay summary will be made available to all partici-
pants at the completion of the study.
Discussion
Active ageing is at the core of this highly innovative pro-
ject that targets women aged 50 years and older. To our
knowledge, there currently exists no other programme
that specifically targets physical activity information, re-
sources and support in a way that is relevant to the
needs of women aged 50 years and over who are insuffi-
ciently physically active.
This innovative programme takes a tailored and sup-
ported approach to the provision of physical activity in-
formation and follow-up support through health
coaching and email or SMS messaging and has the po-
tential to substantially increase physical activity partici-
pation in women people aged 50 years and over. End
user input has been used to design the website to pro-
vide relevance and familiarity to the target audience in
the delivery of information, resources, inspirational stor-
ies and suggestions. Participants are regularly referred to
the website via email or SMS messaging and provided
with health coaching to further tailor and support their
uptake of regular physical activity.
The Active Women over 50 programme also allows for
the targeting of key messages to a broad range of women
aged 50 years and over from different geographical areas
and sociodemographic backgrounds. If found to be feas-
ible and acceptable in this pilot RCT and effective in a
future planned, rigorously conducted RCT, the Active
Women over 50 programme has the potential to be easily
scalable and implemented widely to significantly impact
the lives of many people.
