(Received 12 March 2014; accepted 1 July 2015 )
Obesity is a growing health problem globally (Swinburn et al., 2011 ). It is an established
risk factor for chronic metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (Kelsey, Zaepfel, Bjornstad,& Nadeau,
2014 ; Washington, 2008 ). In overweight and obese children and adolescents
(5–17-year olds; further referred to as youngsters), not only metabolic health, but also
psychological well-being is at risk (Cooke, Butterly, Mackreth, Carroll, & Gately, 2000 ;
Kelsey, Zaepfel, Bjornstad, & Nadeau, 2014 ; Van der Baan-Slootweg et al., 2010 ).
Besides overeating and genetic susceptibility, an insuf ﬁcient level of physical
activity is one of the main contributors to childhood overweight and obesity (Kremers,Visscher, Seidell, van Mechelen, & Brug,
2005 ), and the target of many obesity reduc-
tion programmes (Lee, Shiroma, & Lobelo, 2012 ). Recent meta-analyses, however,
show no effects of present physical activity programmes on body weight or body massindex (BMI, Guerra, Nobre, Silveira, & Taddei,
2013 ; Guerra, Nobre, da Silveira, &
Taddei, 2014 ; Harris, Kuramotoda, Schulzer, & Retallack, 2009 ), blood pressure
(Guerra et al., 2013 ) or physical activity level (Metcalf, Henley, & Wilkin, 2013 ). In
this editorial, we highlight the putative physiological and psychological bene ﬁts of
resistance exercise training for obese youngsters as a relatively new direction inpsychology and health.
The focus of a new programme
In our view, a long-term effective physical activity programme for overweight young-
sters can be accomplished by combining biological and psychological knowledge. We
think that current exercise programmes for overweight and obese youngsters are based
on incorrect assumptions as they tend to focus predominantly on aerobic exercises andweight loss (Faigenbaum,
2007 ). We hypothesise that a physical activity programme
should initially aim for obtaining a healthier body composition rather than weight loss,

i.e. a relatively higher fat-free mass and a relatively lower fat mass. Improving the
fat-free mass/fat mass ratio may increase energy metabolism and decrease the risk ofchronic diseases (Dixon,
2010 ).
Overweight youngsters can often not compete with normal weight youngsters when
it comes to aerobic exercises (Faigenbaum et al., 2009 ). Instead, resistance exercises
might be easier for overweight youngsters, and therefore easier to comply with (Colella,Morano, Robazza, & Bortoli,
2009 ; Riddiford-Harland, Steele, & Baur, 2006 ). Addition-
ally, when they participate in those resistance exercises, it might have a positive effect ontheir muscle (fat-free) mass (Lau, Yu, Lee, & Sung,
2004 ; Schranz, Tomkinson, Parletta,
Petkov, & Olds, 2013 ; Yu et al., 2008 ). We argue that the focus of physical activity should
be less on what these youngsters have to do, and more on what they liketo do. This
mindset might lead to long-term compliance in physical activity behaviour (Fishbein &
Ajzen, 2010 ; Vansteenkiste, Soenens, & Lens, 2007 ). In order to become healthier in the
long term, we suggest obesity reduction programmes in overweight youngsters that focusmore on resistance exercises.
Resistance training as innovation in practice
Resistance exercises, whereby an individual is working against a wide range of resistive
loads to enhance health (Lloyd et al.,
2013 ), are not a new idea. In the past, it has been
suggested that resistance exercises are harmful for youngsters, particularly during
growth (i.e. growth plate injuries or stunted growth). However, more recent data indi-cate that this is a persistent misperception devoid of any evidence (Barbieri & Zaccagni,
2013 ; Benjamin & Glow, 2003 ; Benson, Torode, & Fiatarone Singh, 2008 ; Faigenbaum,
2007 ; Faigenbaum & Myer, 2010 ; Lloyd et al., 2013 ). As long as resistance exercises
are performed under quali ﬁed supervision, they can even prevent injuries and cause a
rapid rehabilitation from injuries (Lloyd et al., 2013 ; Sothern et al., 2000 ). In fact, since
2008, public health agencies included resistance training as part of their physical activ-
ity guidelines for youngsters (Department of Health, Physical Activity, Health Improve-
ment & Protection, 2011 ; McCambridge & Stricker, 2008 ; United States Department of
Health & Human Services, 2008 ; World Health Organization, 2010 ).
Earlier studies have already suggested the use of resistance exercises in (overweight)
youth (see, e.g. Faigenbaum, 2007 ; McGuigan, Tatasciore, Newton, & Pettigrew, 2009 ;
Sothern et al., 2000 ). However, the link between the focus on the biological strengths
and the positive psychological consequences that it may yield is still undervalued. Froma biological perspective, there is a consensus that most youngsters and adults with over-
weight do not only have an absolute higher fat mass but also an absolute higher fat-free
mass than their lean counterparts (Westerterp, Donkers, Fredrix, & Boekhoudt,
1995 ).
Consequently, they have more muscle mass, making them stronger in absolute sense,and less limited in the performance of resistance exercises. Empirical evidence showsthat overweight youngsters perform even better on resistance-based exercises than theirnormal weight peers (Colella, Morano, Robazza, & Bortoli,
2009 ; Riddiford-Harland,
Steele, & Baur, 2006 ). Furthermore, by performing resistance exercises one ’s fat-free
mass increases, resulting in long-term positive effects on metabolic and cardiovascular
health (Alberga, Farnesi, La ﬂeche, Legault, & Komorowski, 2013 ; Lloyd et al., 2013 ).
From a psychological point of view, interventions focusing on behaviour change are
most effective when perceived behavioural control for performing the new behaviour is2 G.A. Ten Hoor et al.
high, and the new behaviour has positive outcome expectations (e.g. more fun) and is
more intrinsically rewarding (Ekkekakis, Lind, & Joens-Matre, 2006 ; Fishbein & Ajzen,
2010 ; Fortier, Williams, Sweet, & Patrick, 2009 ; Rhodes, Fiala, & Conner, 2009 ; Ryan
& Deci, 2002 ). Compared to normal weight youngsters, overweight youngsters are less
capable of performing at a desired or comparable level in aerobic exercises (D ’Hond,
Deforche, De Bourdeaudhuij, & Lenoir, 2008 ; Faigenbaum et al., 2009 ). These negative
experiences may result in disinterest and a loss of motivation, causing a vicious cycle:the loss of motivation causes individuals to disengage from physical activity. This lackof physical activity causes an increase in weight, which in turn may result in evenlower levels of physical activity. We expect that overweight youngsters will notice thatresistance exercises are easier than aerobic exercises and that their performance will bebetter than the performance of their normal weight counterparts. As a consequence,
their enhanced feelings of competence may induce an increase of autonomous motiva-
tion for physical activity, which is required for sustained behaviour change (Silva et al.,
2011 ). We therefore expect that in the long term, these overweight youngsters will feel
ﬁtter, stronger, more con ﬁdent, and they will perceive physical activity as more positive.
The hypothesised psychological gains (e.g. enhanced feelings of competence and per-ceived behavioural control) are lacking in programmes focusing on aerobic exercises(Ryan & Deci,
2002 ).
Current evidence for psychological strengths
Empirical evidence exists for the biological bene ﬁts of resistance training (see, e.g.
Lloyd et al., 2013 ), but we have limited knowledge about the psychological bene ﬁts of
resistance training. In a review by Schranz, Tomkinson, and Olds ( 2013a ) on the effects
of resistance training for overweight youngsters, empirical support for large positiveeffects on muscle strength and small positive effects on body composition werereported. However, the effects of resistance training on psychosocial outcomes remained
unclear because of the limited number of studies available. In a later Randomized
Controlled Trial (RCT), Schranz and colleagues
(2013) found large increases in
strength, perceived behavioural control, con ﬁdence and self-esteem during and immedi-
ately after a six months resistance training programme compared to a no interventioncontrol group. However, six months after the intervention had ceased, the adolescents ’
outcomes had returned to baseline levels. Velez, Golem, and Arent (
2010 ) reported
improved competences and self-worth in both normal and overweight adolescents after12-weeks of resistance training, compared to a regular physical activity education train-
ing. Lubans, Aguiar, and Callister (
2010 ) found a signi ﬁcant improvement in perceived
body attractiveness in secondary school girls after resistance training and compared to acontrol group maintaining their normal physical activity and nutrition behaviour. Yuet al. (
2008 ) found that in a strength exercise group of obese children (but not in a
diet-only group), the physical self-concept in endurance improved. Lau et al. ( 2004 )
found non-signi ﬁcant improvement in obese adolescents ’anxiety levels with no addi-
tional effect of strength training. In a qualitative study, Pescud, Pettigrew, McGuigan,and Newton (
2010 ) reported pleasant social interactions, improved con ﬁdence and
self-esteem, and ongoing parental support as factors for continuation in a resistance
programme for the children.Psychology & Health 3
Research Agenda
To develop a long-term effective resistance-based physical activity programme, there
are still several issues that need to be answered. First, the right methods should be
identi ﬁed to convince parents of the bene ﬁts of resistance exercises. Youngsters often
do not engage in resistance exercises, because parents lack knowledge about resistancetraining. This was shown in a recent cross-sectional study among 314 parents of 12- to15-year olds, where 93 parents (29.6%) stated that they would not allow their child toperform resistance exercises (Ten Hoor et al.,
submitted ). Almost half of them ( n= 42)
indicated the child being too young, or considered resistance exercises not healthyduring growth. Interestingly, Pescud, Pettigrew, McGuigan, and Newton (
2010 ) describe
that parents can learn to accept positive changes in body composition as desirable
outcomes of strength training instead of weight loss.
Second, to make programmes sustainable, youngsters need to be guided from
supervised settings to non-controlled settings where they remain physically active.Adding motivational techniques such as motivational interviewing (Naar-King &Suarez,
2011 ; Ryan & Deci, 2002 ) might be helpful to strengthen the motivation for
change and enhance behavioural maintenance by focusing on what youngsters like todo. Motivational interviewing is
a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the lan-
guage of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to aspeciﬁc goal by eliciting and exploring the person ’s own reasons for change within an
atmosphere of acceptance and compassion (Miller & Rollnick,
2013 ).
Randomised controlled trials should evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness
of a combined resistance and motivational intervention.
Third, further research is required on how possible programme characteristics (e.g.
intensities, quantities, form of exercise, feedback mechanisms) can be tailored to theindividual (e.g. for the same exercise, an overweight adolescent lifts a heavier weightthan a lean adolescent) or group level (e.g. girls may prefer other resistance exercises
than boys, Biddle, Braithwaite, & Pearson,
2014 ). For example, it will be a challenge
to develop resistance exercises that are attractive to adolescent girls. Therefore, thedevelopment of an adequate programme of resistance exercises requires active participa-tion of all stakeholders (including the target population, sports clubs, and physicaleducation teachers).
A fourth research topic is the under-investigated relation between social comparison
and self-determination. Given that overweight youngsters are better in resistance exer-cises than normal weight youngsters, applying social comparison theory (Lemaine,
1974 ; Suls, Martin, & Wheeler, 2002 ; van Knippenberg, Wilke, & de Vries, 1981 )
would suggest having overweight and normal weight youngsters exercising together.Overweight youngsters may ﬁnd out that they perform better in the domain of resis-
tance exercises (contrary to the domain of aerobic exercises) which, in time, is hypothe-sised to improve their self-worth. Some authors (e.g. Ames & Archer,
1988 ) have
suggested that stimulating social comparison may have detrimental effects on autono-mous motivation. However, O ’Keefe, Ben-Eliyahu, and Linnenbrink-Garcia (
2013 ) sug-
gest that social comparison is part of typical classroom settings and therefore
unavoidable. Note that we do not suggest promoting ‘outperforming others ’, as this4 G.A. Ten Hoor et al.
might relate to more controlled types of motivation, but a positive comparison with
others for youngsters who are used to only experiencing negative comparisons.Moreover, Senko, Hulleman, and Harackiewicz (
2011 ) argued that normative-based per-
formance goals often facilitate classroom achievement. Standage, Duda, and Ntoumanis
(2003 ) found that perceptions of competence and relatedness are more predictive of
self-determined motivation than autonomy, but also that normative feedback that isrepeatedly negative will lead to a-motivation. We think that, next to promotingautonomy (e.g. by giving youngsters choices; Deci & Ryan,
2000 ), positive social
experiences of overweight youngsters with resistance exercises may increase their per-ceptions of competence, their self-worth, and in time, their intrinsic motivation for exer-cise. Moreover, having youngsters compete as teams in multi-component exercises,might encourage interpersonal appreciation of various skills, e.g. speed Vs strength.
This is a topic for further research. The relation between social comparison theory and
self-determination theory has rarely been studied empirically (Neighbors & Knee,
2003 ).
Conclusion
We have argued that new physical activity directions for overweight and obese
youngsters might bene ﬁt by a stronger emphasis on resistance exercises, whereas a
motivational intervention might stimulate them to engage in these exercises. When it
comes to overweight and obese youngsters, based on the currently available evidence,we suggest to stop emphasising their overweight, stop pushing them for weight loss,and to start focusing more on resistance exercises. In our view, it is time to start con-centrating on their biological strengths and using psychological principles and tech-niques to make youngsters aware of these strengths. Only then long-term behaviourchanges and long-term health bene ﬁts may be achieved. To make overweight and obese
youngsters healthier, stronger, more con ﬁdent (and feeling better in general), resistance
exercise may be the fruitful way to go.
