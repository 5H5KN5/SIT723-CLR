 Abstract 
Objectives: Inhibitory control training has been hypothesised as a technique that will improve 
an individual’ s ability to overrule impulsive reactions in order to regulate behaviour consistent 
with long-
term goals.  
Methods: A meta-analysis of 19 studies of inhibitory control training and health behaviour s 
was con
ducted to determine the effect of inhibitory control training on reducing harmful 
behaviours. Theoretically-driven moderation analyses were also conducted to determine 
whether extraneous variables account for heterogeneity in the effect; in order to facilitate the 
development of effective intervention strategies. Moderators included type of training task, 
behaviour targeted, measurement of behaviour, and training duration.  
Result
s: A small-but homogenous effect of training on behaviour was found ( d+ = 0.378, CI 95 = 
[0.258, 0.498]). Moderation analyses revealed that the training paradigm adopted, and 
measurement type influenced the size of the effect such that larger effects were found for 
studies that empl
oyed go/no- go training paradigms rather than stop-signal task paradigms, and 
objective outcome measures that were administered immediately yielded the largest and most 
consistent effects on behaviour.  
Conclusi
ons: Results suggest that go/no-go inhibitory control training paradigms can influence 
healt
h behaviour, but perhaps only in the short-term. Future research is required to 
systema
tically examine the influence of training duration, and the longevity of the training 
eff
ect. Determining these factors could provide the basis for cost-effective and efficacious 
healt
h promoting interventions.

 Does Inhibitory Control Training Improve Health Behaviour? A Meta-Analysis 
In
hibitory control and health behaviour 
Inhibitor
y control refers to an individual’s capacity to overrule impulsive reactions in order to 
regulate behaviour in line with long-term goals ( Miy ake et al., 2000 ; Nederkoorn, Houben, 
Hofmann, Roefs, & Jansen, 2010 ). Generally, research indicates that the behaviour of 
individuals low in inhi
bitory control is dominated by impulsive precursors such as implicit 
preferences, rather than more reflective precursors such as intentions or goals (Hofmann et al., 
2009). Research has suggested that this construct is particularly important for the regulation of 
healt
h behaviours including dietary fat intake ( Ha ll, 2012 ) and sleep hygiene (Todd & Mullan, 
2013), and addictive behaviours including alcohol consumption ( Houben & Wier s, 2009). 
Specifically, deficits in inhibitory control have been associated with poorer eating behaviour 
(Hall, 2012 ; Hof
mann, Friese, & Roefs, 2009 ), weight gain ( Nederkoorn et al., 2010 ), and 
increased alcohol consumption ( Houben & Wiers, 2009 ; Murphy & Garavan, 2011 ).  
Inhibitory control training 
Current research suggests that inhibitory control can be trained to improve the regulation of 
health behaviour. This typically involves regular practice on a cognitive task said to tax 
inhibit
ory control, such as the go/no-go task ( GNG; Donders, 1969 ) or the stop-signal task 
(SST; Lappin & Eriksen, 1966 ). Improvement in health behaviour is usually assessed using a 
betwee
n-participants design wherein participants who are randomly assigned to receive 
inhibitory control training are expected to demonstrate positive health-related outcomes 
compared to those assigned to an inert or alternative form of training ( Houben & Jansen, 2011 ; 
Jone
s & Field, 2013; van Koningsbruggen, Veling, Stroebe, & Aarts, 2013 ). Specifically, in 
GNG training paradigms, participants are required to respond as rapidly as possible to a neutral 
set of stimuli while withholding responses to a set of stimuli representing the target behaviour. 
Consistent pa
irings of the no-go response with target stimuli facilitates the retrieval of no- go-

 target stimuli associations and results in improved inhibition of responses to target stimuli 
(Spierer, Chavan, & Manuel, 2013 ). For example, Houben, Nederkoorn, Wiers, and Jansen 
(2011) used a GNG with alcohol-related stimuli in an attempt to reduce alcohol consumption. 
Participa
nts in the training condition reported less alcohol consumption after training compared 
to the control condition, suggesting that an association between alcohol stimuli and a no-go 
re
sponse had formed and that this transferred to reduced alcohol consumption ( Houben et al., 
2011).  
In SST training paradigms, participants are instructed to categorise both target stimuli 
and neutral stimuli as rapidly as possible; however, on a proportion of trials the stop-signal is 
prese
nted after target stimuli and participants are required to inhibit their responses. In this 
way, an association between target stimuli and the stop response is established. In the control 
condition, stop-signals are not consistently paired with a particular category of stimuli, or are 
not presented at all. Lawrence, Verbruggen, Morrison, Adams, and Chambers (2015 )  
demonstrated that participants who received SST training in which stop-signals were paired 
with unhealthy foods consumed significantly less high-calorie food immediately after training, 
compared to those in the control condition (Study1). This suggests that establishing an 
associati
on between unhealthy food and a stop response results in a reduction in consumption 
of unhealthy foods.  
The studies described above appear to indicate that inhibitory control training is an 
effective technique to improve the regulation of health behaviour. However, there exists 
variabil
ity in the findings across the literature. For example, Houben and Jansen (2011) trained 
participants on
 a GNG with chocolate stimuli and failed to demonstrate differences in 
chocolate consumption between no-go and go conditions in an ostensible taste test. 
Additionally, while Houben, Havermans, Nederkoorn, and Jansen (2012 ) demonstrated 
significant differences in self-reported alcohol consumption between training and control 
conditions, both Bowley et al. (2013 ) and Jones and Field (2013 ) failed to replicate this effect.

 Based on these inconsistencies, there is a need to determine the precise size and variability of 
the inhibitory control training effect.  
While numerous inhibitory control training studies have been carried out with varying 
success regarding their effect on health behaviour, few studies have attempted to ascertain the 
mechanism
 responsible for such differences. Preliminary evidence suggests that GNG training 
improves health behaviour by changing impulsive tendencies, or via ‘bottom-up inhibition’ 
(Verbruggen & Logan, 2008 ). For example, Houben et al. (2012 ) employed an implicit 
association task ( IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998 ), and another measure of 
inhibitory control (the SST), and demonstrated that GNG training reduced alcohol 
consumption by devaluation of the alcohol-related stimuli rather than by improvement on the 
SST, suggesting that GNG training results in a decrease in the influence of impulsive 
processes. This is in contrast to mechanistic explanations regarding the effects of SST training, 
where it has been suggested that SST training improves health behaviour by strengthening 
‘top-down’ inhi
bitory control ( Houben & Jansen, 2011 ). Allom and Mullan (2015 ) 
demonstrated that SST training improved Stoop performance, another measure of inhibitory 
control; however, this was not related to change in health behaviour. This suggests that GNG 
training
 may be more effective at changing health behaviour than SST training, due to different 
underlying mechanisms.  
In summary, inhibitory control training does appear to influence health behaviour ; 
however, the precise size and variability of this effect is not yet known. Examining the effect of 
training
 across the available literature, and determining whether any variance in the effect size 
is due to between study differences such as task paradigm, will determine the efficacy of 
training interventions and elucidate the parameters for effective implementation of these 
interve
ntions.

 Potential moderators of training effect  
Evidence points to a number of theoretically-plausible moderators that may influence the effect 
of inhibitory control training on health behaviour. In the next section, the potential moderators 
are
 outlined and how they might affect the relationship between inhibitory control training and 
health behaviour is explored. 
Train
ing paradigm. As described above, the mechanisms by which the two typically 
adopted pa
radigms influence health behaviour may differ ( Allom & Mullan, 2015 ; Hoube n et 
al., 2012). This is likely due to differences in the features of the tasks. For example, in the 
GNG, the g
o response is consistently inhibited for all items in a certain category, whereas in 
the SST the go response is inhibited only for a certain proportion. Therefore examining 
whether the 
effectiveness of training differs according to training paradigm will not only assist 
with task sele
ction for interventions but also help to elucidate the mechanism by which these 
tasks influence
 behaviour.  
Type
 of stimuli.  Both the GNG and the SST can be tailored to train inhibitory control 
in response to a group of stimuli associated with a particular target behaviour, such as alcohol 
consumpti
on. In contrast, several studies have also utilised an inhibitory control task with 
neutral st
imuli (Guerrieri, Nederkoorn, & Jansen, 2012 ; Guerrieri, Nederkoorn, Schrooten, 
Martijn, & Jansen, 2009 ; Lawrence et al., 2015 ), hypothesising that training of a general 
inhibitor
y control mechanism is sufficient to improve health-related outcomes in a specific 
domain. While
 it is likely that the effect of training is larger when behaviour-relevant stimuli 
are used in training tasks because a specific association between the no-go/stop response and 
the target stimuli is being established, testing this in a moderator analysis will determine the 
prec
ise difference in effect size between the two forms of training. 
Training duration.  Inhibitory control training is typically conducted in a single 
session
 (Bowley et al., 2013; Houben et al., 2012; Jones & Field, 2012; Veling, Aarts, & 
Pa
pies, 2011). However, the number of trials that a training session involves differs across 
Accepted Manuscript

 studies. Currently there is no direct evidence that longer training sessions are more beneficial. 
In addition, there may be a threshold for training effects beyond which the benefits of training 
plateau a
nd no new gains are achieved regardless of further training. In order to establish more 
parsimonious interventions, it is therefore important to examine how training duration (number 
of task trials
) influences health behaviour.  
Type
 of health behaviour. It is possible that the effectiveness of inhibitory control 
training
 differs according to the characteristics of the target health behaviour. For example, 
resea
rch has demonstrated a stronger relationship between inhibitory control and health risk 
behaviours such as snack consumption, compared to health enhancing behaviours such as fruit 
and vegetable consumption ( Allom & Mullan, 2014 ; Hall , 2012). Further, McEachan, Lawton, 
and Conner (2010 ) offered a framework for classifying and predicting health behaviours based 
on the unique characteristics of the behaviour, suggesting that not all health behaviours have 
the same dete
rminants. Inhibitory control training may, therefore, produce different results 
simply
 based on the type of health behaviour that is targeted. 
Beh
aviour measurement.  A methodological concern that may account for variation 
in effect sizes across studies is the way in which behaviour is measured. While self-report 
measures ma
y be subject to reporting bias, they may also offer a more externally valid 
assessment of behaviour than laboratory-based measures such as ostensible taste tests ( Smyth 
et al., 2001
), which have been used to measure alcohol and food consumption post-training 
(Bowley et al., 2013 ; Houben, 2011 ; Jones & Field, 2013 ; Nagy, 2012 ).  
Length of follow- up. While previous research has demonstrated differences in health 
behaviour when behavioural measures are administered immediately post-training ( Houben, 
2011), studies that have measured behaviour up to a week post-training have produc ed both 
significant differences in health behaviour outcomes ( Houben et al., 2012 ) , and non-significant 
results (Bowley et al., 2013 ; Jones & Field, 2013 ). Given the lack of conclusive evidence 
regarding the longevity of the inhibitory control training effect on health behaviour, it is 
Accepted Manuscript
7 
 
 
 important to examine the extent to which the effect of training diminishes over time. Therefore, 
length of 
follow-up will be used to determine the longevity of the training effect.  
Present analysis 
Inhibitory control training appears to show promise as an intervention to improve the 
regulation of health behaviours; however, there is substantial observed variation in the strength 
of the eff
ects across the literature (e.g., Bowley et al., 2013 ; Houben et al., 2012 ). This article 
makes a unique contribution to knowledge of behaviour change and inhibitory control by 
atte
mpting to determine the size and variability of the effect of inhibitory control training on 
health behaviour. We acknowledge that inhibitory control is a multifaceted construct 
comprising
 several similar yet distinct inhibitory processes ( Friedman & Miyake, 2004 ), 
including response inhibition, cognitive inhibition, and interference control ( Gray & 
McNaughton, 2000 ; Nigg, 2000 ). The current review will focus exclusively on response 
inhibition –  the suppression of actions that interfere with goal-directed behaviour – primarily 
because the tasks used to assess and train this inhibitory process (i.e., GNG and SST) directly 
and uniquely
 demand response inhibition whereas other inhibitory control tasks (e.g., the 
Flanker and the Stroop tasks) demand other elements of inhibition ( Spierer et al., 2013 ). In 
addition, research with the aim of training self-control by changing behaviour will not be 
considered for similar reasons (e.g., Muraven, 2010 ; Oaten & Cheng, 2006 ). Specifically, self-
control training involves modifying an element of behaviour typically for a two-week period, 
such as maintaining the correct posture. While this action would demand inhibitory control, it 
is unclear whether other processes are also influencing behaviour change.  
A secondary aim is to determine whether potential moderators account for unique 
varianc
e in the inhibitory training effect across studies. Determining whether extraneous 
variables moderate the effect may assist in the development of effective inhibitory control 
strategies to promote better regulation of health behaviour s.

 Method 
Search strategy  
A systematic literature search was conducted of electronic databases including PsycINFO, 
Medline, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations. The search period was from 1990 up to and 
including January 2014. The search was updated in February 2015. This period corresponds to 
the de
velopment of the SST ( Schachar & Logan, 1990 ) a nd the GNG with cues ( Marcz inski & 
Fillmore, 2003 ). The search terms used were: ( go no go OR go nogo OR go no-go OR stop 
signal OR stop-signal  OR response inhibition  OR inhibitory control ) AND (training OR 
intervention OR modif*). Searc hes were limited to human studies, English language 
publications, and adult populations. In addition, reference sections of retrieved articles were 
ex
amined, as were the reference sections of key narrative review articles of response inhibition 
studie
s (Jones, Christiansen, Nederkoorn, Houben, & Field, 2013; Spierer et al., 2013). Finally, 
key authors and researchers in the field were contacted for any additional unpublished data 
sets; however, this did not yield any further data. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Studies were included in the analysis if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) inclusion 
of at least one session of SST or GNG training; (2) adoption of an experimental or randomised 
controlled design; (3) inclusion of a health behaviour outcome measure; and (4) contain ed 
sufficient statistical information to compute an effect size such as cell means and standard 
deviations, or F  ratios, or t-statistics. When the relevant statistics were not reported for 
otherwise eligible studies, authors were contacted to obtain the necessary information. 
There were no restrictions on the nature of behaviour measurement (i.e., self-report or 
objective
 behaviour), or publication status (i.e., available unpublished data were included). 
Studi
es that included two interacting intervention techniques in a single condition using a non-
factorial design (e.g., GNG training and diary keeping) were also excluded. Studies that

 included measures of behavioural outcomes that used the same task or stimuli to assess transfer 
to beha
viour, were also excluded as this might have confounded findings. 
Infor
mation extracted and meta-analytic strategy 
Means and standard deviations of performance on behavioural outcomes were extracted for 
eac
h condition ; when unavailable from the manuscript, authors were contacted to provide this 
information. Whe
re possible, pre and post measures of behavioural outcomes were extracted 
and effect sizes, controlling for pre-scores, were calculated. All information was entered into 
Exc
el spread sheets by two of the authors.  
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v. 2.0 ( B orenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2005 ) 
was used for calculating effect sizes and conducting all analyses including analyses to examine 
small-stud
y bias, heterogeneity, and moderation. The effect size metric employed in the current 
anal
ysis was Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1988 ), which represents the standardised mean difference 
score for experimental and control conditions. Although a systematic literature search was 
conducted, a random effects model was used in order to control for the possibility that relevant 
articles were missed ( Borenstein, Hedges, & Rothstein, 2007 ). A random effects model is also 
recommended when samples across studies are heterogeneous ( DerSimonian & Laird, 1986 ), 
as was the case in the included studies.  
For each effect size a 95% confidence interval (CI 95) was calculated,  and Cochrane’s Q 
and I² statistics were used to explore heterogeneity ( Huedo-Medina, Sánchez-Meca, Marin-
Martinez, & Botella, 2006 ). If Q is statistically significant, heterogeneity is present. I ² 
e
xpr
essed heterogeneity as a percentage of the total variation across the included studies. I² 
values up to 25% indicated low heterogeneity, up to 50% indicated moderate heterogeneity, 
and up to 75% or hi
gher indicated high heterogeneity ( Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 
2003). A moderator analysis was conducted in a mixed-effects model ( Hunter & Schmidt, 
2000).

 Moderator coding 
Moderator coding was initially conducted by the first two authors. The agreement between the 
authors wa
s high ( = .78, p < .001). Discrepancies were discussed with all three authors, and a 
consensus decision was made to resolve the ambiguity.  
Train
ing paradigm. Studies were coded according to their use of the GNG or SST as 
the tra
ining treatment. Tasks requiring participants to withhold a response to all members of a 
category was categorised as having used a GNG. Tasks requiring participants to withhold 
responding to a proportion of stimuli within a category were categorised as having used an 
SST. 
Note that these criteria were followed, rather than terms used by authors such that there 
may be some discrepancies between our coding and authors’ labels (e.g., Veling, Aarts, & 
Papies, 2011; Veling, Aarts, & Stroebe, 2013b )   
Type of stimuli.  Studies were also coded according to their use of behaviour-specific 
or neutral stimuli in the training task. If studies included both types of tasks as separate 
condit
ions, and compared the performance of these conditions to the same c ontrol condition, 
only the behaviour-specific and control comparison was included in order to maintain 
independenc
e of effect sizes. If studies included a condition in which inhibition towards both 
behaviour-specific and neutral stimuli was trained concurrently, comparisons between this 
condition and others were not included due to potential confounds in the concurrent training 
condition. If the training condition was compared to a non-standard control condition, these 
comparisons were excluded due to a lack of consistency across control conditions. 
Type of task. There was overlap between type of training task and the behavioural 
specificity whereby no studies included a neutral GNG. Therefore, a moderator variable was 
crea
ted that incorporated both of these elements : GNG, SST-specific, or SST-neutral training. 
Train
ing duration. In order to assess whether duration of training influenced 
behaviour
al outcomes, a meta-regression was conducted with number of trials entered as a 
continuous predictor of the inhibitory control training effect size.

 Type of health behaviour . Initially, an analysis in which behaviours were categorised 
into health risk or health enhancing behaviours was planned; however, no included studies 
atte
mpted to improve a health enhancing behaviour. Consequently, behaviours were instead 
cate
gorised according to whether they target ed eating behaviour, or alcohol consumption. 
Objective versus subjective. Studies were coded according to the type of behaviour 
measure
: objective measures included laboratory-based taste tests or choice tasks; subjective 
measure
s included self-reported behaviour. 
L
en
gth of follow- up. A moderator variable was created to assess the time at which 
differences in behaviour were assessed: immediate-assessment (immediately after training) vs. 
post-a
ssessment ( all other time frames).  
Measurement of behaviour. There was overlap between how and when behaviour was 
assessed. 
Immediately administered measures were laboratory-based, whereas post-assessment 
measures
 tended to be self-report. Therefore, these two moderators were combined into a 
single moder
ator: immediate-objective, post-objective, or post-subjective. 
Risk of 
bias 
An effort was made to include unpublished studies and datasets, as including only published 
studies risks inflation of effects due to significant results potentially being more likely to be 
published ( Hopewell, McDonald, Clarke, & Egger, 2007 ). The fail-safe N ( Rosenberg, 2005 ), 
was also computed to estimate how many potential effects may be required to reduce the 
overall averaged corrected effect size to a trivial size. However, the fail-safe N does not control 
for ‘small
 study’ effects, which may reflect a tendency for low-powered small studies to be 
included in published data sets ( Hopewell et al., 2007 ). Such effects may be indicative of 
publica
tion bias ( Sterne, Egger, & Smith, 2001 ). This can be detected by examining the plot of 
the effect size against study precision, that is, the reciprocal of the standard error. The 
distribution should reflect a ‘funnel’ shape, such that larger studies appear close to the true 
effect size and smaller, and therefore more imprecise, studies fall further away and should be 
Accepted Manuscript
12 
 
 
 evenly distributed. Bias is present if values are not evenly distributed within the funnel or fall 
outside the funnel shape. Funnels for the effect sizes in the current study and moderator 
subgroups were examined. Duval and Tweedie’s ( 2000) Trim and Fill procedure was applied to 
control for ‘small study’ effects in which studies with disproportionately large effects with 
small sample sizes that are not evenly distributed are removed and ‘filled’ with hypothetical 
studies to revolve the uneven distribution. To the extent that the averaged corrected effect size 
remains unchanged after the trim and fill, we have evidence that the sample of studies is 
unaffected by the small-study bias identified by Egge r, Smith, Schneider, and Minder (1997 ). 
Results 
After duplicates were removed, the search strategy identified 625 records that were title 
scree
ned, resulting in 54 records that were screened at the abstract stage. After exclusions, 18 
full text articles were screened. The search identified 23 effect sizes that were eligible for 
inclusion 
in the meta-analysis. However, data sets for two studies eligible for inclusion, but 
with insuff
icient data to compute effect size, could not be obtained through direct contact with 
the authors ( Guerrieri et al., 2012 ; Guerrieri et al., 2009 ) and were therefore excluded. In 
addition, effect sizes for the influence of training on one outcome measure could not be 
obtained from one study ( Nagy, 2012 ). One study measured behaviour using a task that 
included the sa
me stimuli that participants were trained on, and was therefore not included due 
to possible issues with the generalisability of the findings ( Veling, Aarts, & Stroebe, 2013a ). 
Finally, Todd and Mullan (2013 ) used both GNG training and diary keeping concurrently to 
influence behaviour. As the effect of GNG training alone could not be determined from thi s 
data, this stud
y was excluded. Therefore, 14 articles with 19 independent tests of the training 
effe
ct were included in the meta-analysis. All included studies were peer reviewed except Nagy  
(2012), which was a masters dissertation. Figure 1 shows the study selection process.

 Characteristics of included studies 
The mean sample size within the datasets was 73 One study included a neutral inhibitory 
control tra
ining task ( Lawrence et al., 2015: Study 3 ); a further two included both a behaviour-
specific condition and a neutral task training condition ( Jones & Field, 2013 ; Nagy, 2012 ). In 
order to maintain independence of effect sizes, only the effect size for the behaviour-specific 
and control comparison was extracted and entered into the analysis. Four studies included a 
condition in which participants were trained on both behaviour-specific and neutral stimuli 
concurrently ( Allom & Mullan, 2015 ; Houben, 2011 ; Houben & Jansen, 2011 ). In addition, 
one study included a previously-established intervention strategy as a secondary control 
condition 
(Bowley et al., 2013 ), namely,  the Brief Alcohol Intervention ( Hallett, Maycock, 
Kypri, Howat, & McManus, 2009 ). Comparisons between inhibitory control training and these 
control conditions were not included due to the small number of studies utilising non-standard 
control condit
ions. 
Two different types of behaviours were reported: alcohol consumption (k = 5), and 
eati
ng behaviour outcomes (k = 14). The majority of studies used a single behaviour measure 
to assess the
 effect of training. The most frequently used objective measure was an ostensible 
taste test admi
nistered immediately after the training session, while the most frequent 
subjective measure was a self-report questionnaire. In one study, participants were given a 
small bag of p
alatable food to take home and return the next day after consuming as much or as 
little of the food as they liked (Veling et al., 2011). As this measure was subject to confound; 
for example, other individuals may have consumed the contents of the bag, this was considered 
a subjective measure. While some studies used both objective and subjective measures of 
healt
h behaviour in the same study, this was confined to the studies examining the effect of 
training
 on alcohol consumption ( Bowley et al., 2013 ; Houben et al., 2011 ; Jones & Field, 
2013; Nagy, 2012 ), where both an ostensible taste test and the Time line F ollow-back 
questionnaire ( Sobell & Sobell, 1992 ) were used to assess differences in alcohol consumption

 between train ed and non-train ed conditions. For these studies, the mean of the effect size 
across measures was taken. Length of follow-up ranged from 1 day to 1 week. Finally, in 
studies that used a pre-post design to assess change in behaviour ( Allom & Mullan, 2015 ; 
Houben e
t al., 2012; Veling, van Koningsbruggen, Aarts, & Stroebe, 2014 ), the effect size was 
calculated after taking into account baseline behaviour. See Table 1 of Supplementary material 
for detailed 
characteristics of included studies, and moderator coding. 
Overall training effect  
The averaged corrected standardised mean difference for response inhibition training on health 
behaviour wa s d+ = 0.378, CI 95 = [0.258, 0.498], p < .001. This represents an effect that falls 
between the small (0.20) and medium (0.50) effect size guidelines proposed by Cohen (1988 ). 
See Figure 2 for a forest plot of the included effect sizes. Tests for heterogeneity indicated that 
there was no substantial heterogeneity in the effect size across studies, Q (18) = 16.501, p = 
.558; I2 = 00.00% , indicating that the true effect size was likely to fall between the confidence 
interva
l indicated. In addition, the effect size could also be considered non-trivial given that the 
confidenc
e interval did not include zero. The fail safe sample-size ( NFS = 176) exceeded the 
suggested cut off value, indicating that it was highly unlikely that sufficient studies with null 
effects exist which, if included, could reduce the size of the effect. However, inspection of 
funnel plot and application of Duval and Tweedie’s (2000) Trim and Fill method suggested 
that three studies were missing on the left side of the mean effect size. This indicated that the 
included sma
ll-studies, which fell to the right of the mean, may have inflat ed the effect size. 
Using the Trim and Fill method to adjust for small-study bias, the imputed point estimate was 
d+ = 0.328, CI 95 = [0.214, 0.441], as this effect remain ed significant, the true effect size is not 
substantially influenced by small study bias..

 Moderator analyses 
The overall analysis revealed a homogenous effect of inhibitory control training on health 
behaviour, indicating low variability between studies, and a lack of extraneous variables 
influencing the effect. However, moderator analyses were conducted as planned given the 
numerous the
oretical and conceptual reasons outlined in the previous sections. We deemed it 
importa
nt to explore these moderators on the basis that any differences detected would be 
useful for researchers intending to use inhibitory control training in future behaviour change 
interve
ntions. 
Training paradigm. Studies that utilised a GNG training paradigm yielded a medium

Discussion 
This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis of the effect of inhibitory control training on 
health behaviour. The aim was to address the observed variation in findings within the 
inhibitory control training literature by conducting a quantitative cumulative analysis of studies 
examining the effect of inhibitory control training on health behaviour. The meta-analysis of 
the overall
 training effect produced a small but homogenous effect size, which was considered 
non-trivial. This suggests that inhibitory control training may be a useful intervention 
technique for reducing health risk behaviours. However, given that the size of the effect was 
small, inhibitory control training may be more useful as an adjunct to other effective 
intervention techniques. For example, Veling et al. (2014 ) demonstrated that GNG training and 
Accepted Manuscript

 implementation intentions together had a greater effect on weight loss than the two techniques 
separately. Regardless of whether inhibitory control training is used as an adjunct or standalone 
technique, it is useful to know the optimal paradigm to implement. With this in mind,  
conceptually driven moderation analyses were conducted, revealing differences in the size of 
the training effect according to type of task, and measurement of behaviour. Training effects 
did not differ according to the length of training, nor the type of behaviour targeted. Each of 
these f
indings will be discussed in turn, with specific emphasis on theoretical and practical 
implications.  
Type of task 
In general, training that utilised the SST appeared to produce a smaller e ffect size than training 
that utilis
ed the GNG, suggesting that different mechanisms may underlie the two tasks, 
resulting in  different effects on behaviour.  Verbruggen and Logan (2008 ) suggest that there 
are two different types of response inhibition; automatic or ‘bottom-up’ response inhibition, 
and controlled or ‘top-down’ response inhibition.  Automatic response inhibition is formed 
when associations between stimuli and a no-go response are consistent, resulting in bottom-up 
retrieval of
 these associations. When these associations are inconsistent, top-down activation of 
the
 stop process is required. Preliminary evidence suggests that GNG training is influencing 
behaviour via
 bottom up response inhibition. Recently, Houben a nd Jansen (2015 ) 
demonstrated that associations between chocolate stimuli and a ‘go’ response were 
significantly reduced in participants who received GNG training compared to control 
participants. Allom and Mullan (2015 ) attempted to determine the mechanism underlying SST 
training suggesting that training improves Stroop performance, arguably a measure requiring 
controll
ed response inhibition ( Friedman & Miyake, 2004 ; MacL eod, 1991 ). However, while 
Stroop performance improved in those who received SST training, this did not translate to 
change in health behaviour. It may be the case that the GNG and SST influence behaviour via 
Accepted Manuscript
18 
 
 
 automatic and controlled response inhibition respectively, but that training automatic response 
inhibition may be more effective for behaviour change. 
Training in which a behaviour-specific GNG, or a behaviour-specific SST, was used 
produc
ed significant and homogenous effect sizes, whereas neutral-stimuli training did not. 
This suggests that exercising and strengthening general inhibitory control may not be sufficient 
to produc
e changes in behaviour. However, it must be noted that only one included study 
utilise
d neutral-stimuli training ( Lawrence et al., 2015: Study 3 ), ther efore, conclusions 
regarding the size and consistency of the effect of neutral training on health behaviour cannot 
be drawn. Future research should aim to replicate the study by Lawrence et al. (2015 ) in order 
to add further evidence to the argument that training needs to include behaviour-specific 
stimuli in order to achieve behaviour change.  
Longevity of effect 
Objective outcomes that were measured immediately after training produced a significant 
eff
ect, whereas outcomes measured at a later time point did not yield a statistically significant 
effe
ct, suggesting that training effects do not persist over time. Interestingly , subjective 
measures, which were all administered at least one day after training, resulted in a small but 
significant effect. However, this effect may have been inflated due to reporting biases, and the 
effe
ct size corresponding to laboratory measures that were not immediately administered may 
be a c
loser indication of the longevity of the training effect. Indeed, Allom and Mullan (2015 ) 
failed to replicate their initial finding that SST training led to weight loss when weight was 
measured objectively (Study 2) rather than using self-report (Study 1). 
Length of training 
Current results indicate no relationship between length of training and effect size; however, it 
is worth noting that other task parameters such as training paradigm and method of 
measurement may have masked whether the number of trials influenced the size of the effect.

 Future research should systematically vary the number of trials and sessions in order to 
determi
ne if more training results in greater benefits to health outcomes. 
Beh
aviour 
Regarding differential training effects according to behaviour type, analyses revealed non-zero 
effe
cts for both eating behaviour and alcohol consumption. It may be that training is equally 
effe
ctive for behaviours that can be broadly categorised together. In the current example, 
alcohol and unhealthy food consumption can be categorised as health risk behaviours, both of 
which require avoiding unhealthy stimuli. Inhibitory control training may be less effective for 
other categories of behaviour such as behaviours that require approaching healthy stimuli. 
While inhibitory control has been consistently related to health risk behaviour and less 
consistently to health promoting behaviour ( Allom & Mul lan, 2014), it remains that this 
assumption needs to be examined experimentally in order for any firm conclusions to be 
reached.  
Limitations 
The inclusion of a relatively small sample of studies may have inflated the overall effect size 
and there
fore caution should be exercised when interpreting some of the reported effects. 
However, the broad search strategy and inclusion of unpublished works ensured that the overall 
effe
ct size was not inflated due to statistically significant effects being more likely to be 
published. The present analysis did not include neurological outcomes such as differences in 
brain ac
tivation as demonstrated by EEG, such as that reported in  Bowley et al. (2013 ). W hile 
the primary aim here was to examine the effect of training on behavioural outcomes, such as 
alcohol c
onsumption and eating behaviour, it may be worthwhile to systematically review the 
influence
 of inhibitory control training on neurophysiological outcomes and brain plasticity, 
particularly to further elucidate the mechanisms by which training may influence behaviour 
(for a narrative review, see: Spierer et al., 2013 ). Finally, few studies included a pre-post 
design to assess change in behaviour; as such, the results of the present meta-analysis primarily 
Accepted Manuscript
20 
 
 
 reflect differences  in behaviour between conditions. To address this concern, future research 
should att
empt to include measures that allow for pre- and post-intervention assessment of 
behaviour
al outcomes. 
Conclusions 
The present meta-analysis provides evidence that inhibitory control training results in 
statistically significant reductions in health-compromising behaviours such as alcohol 
consumpti
on and unhealthy eating. The available evidence also suggests that the GNG may be 
more eff
ective than the SST, these tasks need to be tailored to the target behaviour in order to 
be succe
ssful, and measurement method must be taken into account when evaluating the effects 
of training. Further research is needed to systematically examine whether length of training 
influence
s the size of the effect, and whether the effects of behaviour-specific training persist 
long
 after the training session. Determining the optimal length of training, and whether these 
eff
ects transfer to everyday behaviour, would provide the basis for cost-effective and 
effic
acious methods to reduce health-risk behaviours.
