ABSTRACT
Informal caregivers play an increasingly important role in the provi -
sion of care services, especially for the ageing population. At pre-
sent, the evidence on the resilience of the Internet to family 
caregivers is still limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
the factors related to the resilience of the Internet to family care -
givers. We searched retrieved randomized controlled trials (rct) of 
the effects of Internet interventions on resilience in informal care -
givers from the beginning of the database to 1 November 2022. 
A preliminary search identified 3348 studies, 5 of which met the 
inclusion criteria. The studies involved 482 participants from four 
countries. Our results show that compared to the control group, 
internet intervention can effectively improve the resilience level of 
caregivers [SMD = 0.65, 95%CI(0.04, 1.26), P ≤ 0.05]. In our study, 
Web-based interventions can significantly improve the adaptability 
of informal caregivers. In addition, our research also pointed out 
many resources that can be used, such as online learning, online 
answers and online psychological counseling provided for care -
givers through the Internet, which can effectively reduce their 
burden of care and thus improve their resilience. In the future, 
these findings can be used to develop projects to improve the 
resilience of caregivers through personalized Internet intervention, 
so as to meet the care needs of patients.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
With the aging of the population and the annual growth of the prevalence rate of 
chronic diseases (Wiederhold et al., 2013 ), most elderly patients with chronic 
diseases have weak health awareness, low ability to accept new knowledge, dete -
rioration of body functions, reduction of memory and cognitive ability, and the 
daily management of patients with chronic diseases is complex, so the care of 
chronic diseases is a long-term and uninterrupted work (Li et al., 2020 ; Slev 
et al., 2016 ). Most patients choose to recuperate at home, mainly taken care of by 
their spouses, adult children or nannies. This group is called informal family 
caregivers (Geng et al., 2018 ; Sun et al., 2022 ). Most family caregivers support the 
intervention in a ‘face to face’ way, but the use effect does not meet the expectations 
(Lam & Lam, 2009 ). Especially in the COVID-19 pandemic period, patients with

chronic diseases were forced to reduce the opportunity to go out for medical 
treatment, and their disease care became a major task for family caregivers 
(Mitnick et al., 2010 ).
The process of disease care is considered to be one of the most stressful experiences, 
because family caregivers may face long-term problems in managing activities, behaviors 
and psychological conditions of daily life of chronic diseases (Drummond et al., 2019 ; 
Spigelmyer & Schreiber, 2019 ; Zamani et al., 2021 ), nursing and providing emotional 
support (Tatangelo et al., 2018 ; Zwingmann et al., 2018 ). In addition, improper nursing 
behavior will also lead to various behavioral and psychological problems of the nursing 
subjects (Jennings et al., 2015 ). However, due to the lack of supportive resources and 
disease related knowledge (Zarit et al., 2010 ), family caregivers have insufficient con-
fidence in managing care (Nabuurs-Franssen et al., 2005 ). When their relatives have 
disease related behavior problems, need emotional support, and need to coordinate 
disease care (Luo et al., 2020 ; Peeters et al., 2010 ), they do not know what to do. 
Helping family caregivers improve their resilience is therefore likely to become an 
increasingly pressing social issue.
Family resilience refers to the positive behavior patterns and the ability to maintain 
normal operation of individuals and families under stressful situations, and is the feature 
and performance of promoting family recovery and becoming strong in crisis (Li et al.,  
2018 ; Palacio et al., 2020 ). Family resilience is not a static concept (Heathcote et al., 2021 ). 
It emphasizes the dynamic process of how families show their ability or advantages to 
cope with stress when facing adversity, and plays a decisive role in family stress adapta -
tion (Miller-Graff et al., 2020 ; Ousey et al., 2015 ). As a family advantage, family resilience 
is of positive significance to family health and the growth and development of individual 
members (Lai et al., 2020 ), studies by Kim (Kim et al., 2018 ) and Whitehead (Whitehead 
et al., 2018 ) have shown that the burden of family caregiving for chronically ill patients 
negatively affects family adaptation, and that better family resilience is a key force in 
achieving good family adaptation. In the digital era, people obtain a large amount of 
health information from the Internet (Duggleby et al., 2019 ), providing new opportu -
nities for disease management, and continuously and in real time increasing bilateral 
exchanges between medical personnel and patients inside and outside hospitals (van den 
Berg et al., 2016 ; Wasilewski et al., 2017 ). With the rapid development of information 
science and technology and the wide application of smart phones (Meichsner et al.,  
2019 ), mobile health care has gradually become a convenient and efficient health 
management monitoring tool. It has been recognized that the Internet is effective in 
providing health information to the public (Loughnan et al., 2019 ). In addition, Internet- 
based ACT has been reported to be promising in managing trauma-related anxiety, 
depression, chronic pain, and distress, as well as promoting caregiver mental health 
and psychological flexibility (Brown et al., 2016 ; Lappalainen et al., 2015 ), consistent with 
Kaltenbaugh’s research (Kaltenbaugh et al., 2015 ).
The aim of this study is to summarize and critically explore the level of Internet-based 
interventions on caregiver resilience in published research to date and to identify ways in 
which Internet-based interventions can increase the level of caregiver resilience. Here, we 
present a systematic review to document the nature and extent of the literature related to 
the resilience of Internet interventions for informal caregivers, including levels and 
relevance, to provide a valuable scientific basis for health policymakers.2
 J. WU ET AL.
Material and methods
Meta-analysis was performed based on the general principles of the Cochrane Handbook 
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Becker & AD, 2011 ). The review was registered 
on PROSPERO (NO.CRD42022335820).
Search strategy
We systematically searched the literature concerning health literacy in cancer caregivers 
across six databases, CNKI, PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science 
between the establishment of the database and November 2022. Databases was system -
atically searched using free-text terms related to ‘Internet’ and ‘resilience’ and ‘Caregivers’.
Selection criteria
All articles that describe a study specifically evaluating the resilience of the Internet to 
family caregivers are targeted. If the empirical articles (1) measure the resilience level of 
informal caregiver quantitatively, (2) include participants of any type of Internet inter -
vention on family informal caregiver, (3) the publication language was limited to English 
or Chinese, and (4) design: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), they are eligible for 
inclusion. If (1) there is no clear concern about the impact of the Internet on informal 
caregivers’ family resilience, or (2) the article does not describe empirical research (such 
as reviews, comments, editorials, etc.), these studies are excluded.
Data extraction
Titles and abstracts of identified articles from the searches were independently screened 
for eligibility by two reviewers (WJW and WM). Following this, the full texts of the 
remaining articles were subsequently sought and assessed for eligibility by the two 
reviewers according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned previously. Any 
discrepancies between reviewers’ decisions were resolved through discussion and con-
sensus or through the help of a third reviewer (YH).
Quality assessment
Two researchers (WJW and WM) used Cochrane 5.1.0 system (Li et al., 2020 ) evaluation 
manual to evaluate the bias risk, and checked the cross results. If there is any dispute, it 
shall be resolved through negotiation or agreed by the third researcher (YH).
Data analysis
Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Mean variance (WMD) com -
bined effects were used for quantitative data of the same scale; standardized mean 
variance (SMD) combined effects were used for quantitative data of different scales. 
Estimates and 95% confidence interval (CI) are given for each effect size point. 
Heterogeneity was tested for each study. If P > 0.1 and I2 ≤50%, a fixed-effects model PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE
 3
was used to combine data for analysis; if P ≤0.1 and I2 >50%, a random-effects model was 
chosen to combine effect sizes after analyzing the source of heterogeneity by sensitivity or 
subgroup analysis. If the source of heterogeneity still could not be determined, descrip -
tive analysis was used. 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all analyses, and 
P ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Search results summary
Following database searching,1647 articles were identified for possible inclusion, as per 
Figure 1. Of these articles, 1325 were duplicates and were subsequently excluded. Upon 
initial screening of the abstracts of the remaining articles, it was determined that 1319 did 
not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 56 articles were identified for full-text review. 
Of these fifty-six articles, only five studies fulfilled the necessary inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.

Characteristics of the included studies
Of the five identified articles, there were 482 family caregivers. The sample size ranged 
from 12 to 203, including caring for the following types of patients: amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (Sharbafshaaer et al., 2022 ), cancer (Köhle et al., 2021 ), congenital pseudar -
throsis of tibia (Ouyang, 2021 ), and dementia (Pan et al., 2019 ). One article did not report 
the type of chronic disease (Vahabi et al., 2022 ). All studies were randomized controlled 
and published between 2019 and 2022. Two studies were conducted in China, one in 
Italy, one in Canada and one in the Netherlands. From the articles included, the 
caregivers are mainly women. Four studies were caregivers of family members, and 
one was home caregiver (Vahabi et al., 2022 ). The summarized characteristics of these 
studies are shown in Table 1.
Assessment quality of studies
Baseline surveys existed in 6 studies, of which 2 described the method of randomization 
(Pan et al., 2019 ; Vahabi et al., 2022 ), and the remaining studies only mentioned that the 
randomization bias was small; 1 study explained allocation concealment (Vahabi et al.,  
2022 ); In blinded settings, no studies dealt with blinding; All five studies explained or 
treated cases of loss to follow-up or withdrawals or treated statistically. Five studies 
reported on prespecified outcomes, no selective reporting of study results and other 
source biases were identified, and reporting bias was small. See Table 2.
Results of a meta-analysis
All five studies (n = 482) reported the mean and standard deviation of Internet based 
resilience to family caregivers. Because the included studies were evaluated on different

scales, SMD was used to combine the results, showing huge heterogeneity between the 
studies [I2 = 87%, P < 0.00001], and a meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect 
model [SMD = 0.65, 95%CI (0.04, 1.26), P ≤0.05]. The forest plots are shown in Figure 2.
Factors related to the elastic impact of the internet on family caregivers
The Internet has diversified its intervention in the resilience of family caregivers. It 
includes online learning for caregivers (app search, online video access to disease related 
care knowledge); Online answers (peer education, professional medical care and profes -
sional answers); Online psychological guidance (regular follow-up by medical staff and 
guidance by professional psychologists to relieve the pressure and burden of care), the 
results are shown in Table 3.
Online learning
Caregivers lack care skills in actual care (Fernandes et al., 2021 ). Most of the patients’ diseases 
are chronic diseases, and the possibility of complete recovery is small (El Masry et al., 2013 ; 
Subih et al., 2020 ). Caregivers need more careful care. However, limited education and lack of Table 2. Risk of bias summary in the included literature.

 J. WU ET AL.
professional knowledge and skills make caregivers have low awareness of the patients’ 
diseases and lack of care experience (Köhle et al., 2021 ; Ouyang, 2021 ). The five studies all 
acquired disease related care knowledge through Internet, such as audio, video conference 
teaching, online search, etc. to achieve the purpose of care.Table 3. Factors related to the elastic impact of the Internet on informal caregivers.

Online answers
During the period of novel coronavirus, offline medical care has been unable to meet 
people’s needs. With the popularity of smart phones, tablets, etc., it has become normal to 
use network tools for medical consultation and health education (Vahabi et al., 2022 ). It 
can provide efficient health guidance, etc., without location restrictions, with more rich 
content, and easier channels, and it also helps to help patients with chronic diseases 
recover quickly (Bajjani-Gebara et al., 2019 ; Margolis et al., 2013 ; McManus et al., 2021 ). 
Four studies (Köhle et al., 2021 ; Pan et al., 2019 ; Vahabi et al., 2022 ) conducted remote 
disease consultation and discussion through Internet platform, including video confer -
ence and platform communication, and professional medical personnel answered ques -
tions and answered questions for them, or obtained nursing experience through peer 
education to reduce the burden of care, so as to improve resilience.
Online psychological guidance
Due to the lack of proper professional care knowledge and skills, caregivers may 
encounter many problems and challenges when caring for patients with long-term, 
chronic and complex problems (Spigelmyer & Schreiber, 2019 ; Yilmaz et al., 2019 ). 
Caregivers are prone to bear some burden on their physiology, psychology, social, 
economic and other aspects in the process of taking care of patients for a long time, 
which makes their mental health level and quality of life significantly lower than 
that of normal people. In the four studies (Köhle et al., 2021 ; Ouyang, 2021 ; Pan 
et al., 2019 ; Sharbafshaaer et al., 2022 ), professional psychologists provided psycho -
logical education and answered psychological questions through online remote 
consultation. With online music therapy and mindfulness training as 
a supplement, it can reduce their psychological burden and pressure of care, thus 
increasing resilience.
Discussion
With the change of medical model and the support of national policy on Internet medical 
development, it has become a development trend for family caregivers to obtain care 
knowledge (Li & Loke, 2014 ), compared with traditional health education, health educa -
tion on the Internet mainly enables caregivers to receive targeted health education 
through the Internet and multimedia in different places and at different times without 
restriction, guides caregivers to learn relevant skills, and helps caregivers to judge the 
patient’s disease status, thus contributing to the physical and mental health of caregivers 
(Calvillo-Arbizu et al., 2021 ; Davidson et al., 2021 ).
Internet intervention effective in increasing resilience of informal caregivers
The results of this study showed that the Internet intervention had a positive effect on the 
resilience of informal caregivers compared to the control group (Vahabi et al., 2022 ), 
consistent with the findings of Luangphituck (Luangphituck et al., 2023 ). The likely 
reason for this is that this intervention highly motivates participants to work together to 
build a social support network, which in part improves caregiver self-efficacy and mental 
health and resilience, thereby reducing the burden of caregiving (Cangelosi et al., 2021 ; 8
 J. WU ET AL.
Mieronkoski et al., 2017 ), and levels of disease knowledge, anxiety and depression are 
often associated with caregiver burden Compared to the most recently published sys-
tematic evaluation of Internet interventions, our findings show lower levels of resilience 
among informal caregivers (Dedzoe et al., 2023 ). This variation may be explained by the 
characteristics of the care recipient, the duration and intensity of care, the employment 
status of the caregiver, and the nature of the caregiver’s relationship with the care 
recipient.
The research shows (Ouyang, 2021 ) that the resilience level of caregivers increases 
with the progress of the intervention time. The possible reason is that the study used the 
Internet plus follow-up platform to carry out a three-month continuous psychological 
intervention on the intervention objects. This process is conducive to helping the 
intervention objects establish their psychological recovery ability with newer individuals, 
thus promoting the improvement of family resilience (Page et al., 2021 ). It is the result of 
time effect, intervention effect and interaction between the two. A combination of 
Internet-based use of individual self-directed online learning and group videoconferen -
cing allows for peer-to-peer connections, and online group videoconferencing provides 
opportunities for marginalized groups, such as temporary foreign workers, to connect 
and engage in social action to challenge existing exploitative policies and practices and 
achieve equity (Vahabi et al., 2022 ).
Factors related to the elastic impact of the Internet on family caregivers
Sharbafshaaer have shown that the level of disease knowledge may be related to the 
burden of caregivers (Sharbafshaaer et al., 2022 ), while resilience is negatively related to 
the burden of care (Duggleby et al., 2019 ). Compared with offline knowledge acquisition, 
internet based continuous care can effectively reduce the burden of family caregivers 
(Vahabi et al., 2022 ). The reason may be that this method is more comprehensive and 
personalized through effective education through the Internet (Fitryasari et al., 2018 ), 
and caregivers can get timely and effective answers to their problems, Sustainability can 
consolidate disease related knowledge, so as to more effectively strengthen patient disease 
management (Deen et al., 2013 ). Providing targeted health education at anytime and 
anywhere makes the communication between caregivers and patients more direct and 
effective, which makes up for the lack of resources in traditional chronic disease manage -
ment in hospitals and conforms to the needs of the development of the times (Ouyang,  
2021 ). This not only improves the quality and efficiency of medical services, but also 
promotes the interaction between medical staff and patients and caregivers, which helps 
to cultivate a harmonious doctor-patient relationship and becomes another important 
way for patients and caregivers to obtain support (Köhle et al., 2021 ; Loughnan et al.,  
2019 ).
The two studies (Köhle et al., 2021 ; Vahabi et al., 2022 ) adopted online ACT inter -
vention model. The results showed that this intervention highly encouraged caregivers to 
participate in the establishment of social support networks, and improved their mental 
health and resilience to a certain extent (Vahabi et al., 2022 ). Compared with the control 
group, the intervention group increased the absorption and use of mindfulness strategies. 
Mindfulness is related to the concern and continuous participation in positive and 
negative experiences, rather than avoiding internal negative experiences. Accepting PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE
 9
a person’s life experience is a core action process, which allows people to accept negative 
thoughts and feelings without being described by them, which in turn promotes their 
self-esteem and resilience. And research shows that through online ACT, more peer 
support is obtained, so that participants have the ability to expand their social network, 
and their resilience and coping ability are improved.
Limitations
There are still some limitations in this study. On the one hand, in terms of search sources, 
although we attempted to improve the search strategy by searching multiple databases 
using relevant keywords and consulting academic librarians, we inevitably missed some 
literature, especially relevant research conference proceedings published by non- 
governmental organizations. On the other hand, as far as the analytical method of 
literature search is concerned, this study did not conduct a comparative analysis of the 
literature across time, which to a certain extent could not comprehensively reveal the 
technological and socio-cultural influences of Internet interventions on the resilience of 
informal caregivers. In the future, the introduction of knowledge mapping can be 
considered to map and analyze the themes of the literature at different stages.
Conclusion
The present study shows that the Internet can significantly improve the adaptive capacity 
of family caregivers. In addition, our study points out many resources that can be used, 
such as online learning, online answers and online counseling for caregivers through the 
Internet can be effective in increasing their resilience and thus reducing their caregiving 
burden. Therefore, these findings can be used in future development programs and will 
be effective in increasing the resilience of family caregivers. In addition, future research 
could focus on the duration and frequency of online learning and communication 
between caregivers to provide caregivers with more appropriate and individualized 
interventions to meet the patient’s care needs.
