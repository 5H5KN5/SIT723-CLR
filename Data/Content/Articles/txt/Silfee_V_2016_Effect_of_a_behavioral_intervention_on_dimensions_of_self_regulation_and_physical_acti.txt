Introduction
Regular physical activity (PA) has lasting effects on type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Planned phys -
ical activity has consistently improved disease risk and outcomes (Espeland, 2007; Group 
LAR, 2010; Ratner, 2006). However, a majority of adults with T2DM are not engaging in 
regular PA (Nelson, Reiber, & Boyko, 2002). Diet and glucose management training has ABSTRACT
The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the preliminary effect 
of a behavioral intervention on the use of self-regulation strategies 
and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes. 23 individuals recruited from 
ResearchMatc.org and campus advertisements were randomized into 
an intervention (n = 12) and control (n = 11) group. The intervention group received a behavioral intervention that used goal setting, time management, and self-monitoring to target dimensions of self-regulation and MVPA. The control received information regarding their PA habits. MVPA was measured via BodyMedia Armbands at 
pre- and post-test. The use of self-regulatory strategies for MVPA 
was assessed at pretest and posttest using the Self-Regulation for Exercise Scale. Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated to determine the practical impact of the intervention. The intervention had a large effect on all dimensions of self-regulation across time: including total self-regulation (3.15), self-monitoring (4.63), goal setting (3.17), social support (1.29), self-reward (1.98), time management (4.41), and overcoming barriers (2.25). The intervention had no impact on dimensions of MVPA across time. This pilot study demonstrated the 
ability of a behavioral intervention to improve the use of self-regulation 
strategies for MVPA in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. These findings can further inform the development of health promotion 
programs to promote self-regulation. Future research should focus on 
determining ability of improvements in self-regulation to stimulate behavior change.KEYWORDS

examined self-regulation as an important strategy for T2DM behavior change (Glasgow, 
Toobert, & Hampson, 1996; Norris, Engelgau, & Narayan, 2001; Wheeler, Wheeler, Ours, 
& Swider, 1985). Research is needed to develop behavioral programs that promote regular 
PA. Self-regulation is the ability to modify behavior using: self-monitoring, goal setting, and 
time management (Bandura, 1991; Biddle & Fuchs, 2009). To date, one study has shown an 
increase in self-regulation supporting PA behavior in adults with T2DM (Olson & McAuley, 
2015). Other studies are limited by not measuring changes in psychosocial variables or 
producing mixed results in behavior change (Glasgow et al., 1992; Kirk, Barnett, Leese, & 
Mutrie, 2009; Norris et al., 2001; Plotnikoff et al., 2010; Tudor-Locke et al., 2004). More 
studies are needed to establish self-regulation as an important construct for PA behavior change (Heiss & Petosa, 2014). The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effect of 
a brief behavioral intervention on the use of self-regulation strategies and moderate-to-vig -
orous physical activity (MVPA) among overweight and obese adults with T2DM. Based 
on the literature demonstrating the ability to improve self-regulation strategies for other 
health behaviors, we hypothesized that the intervention group would increase their use of 
self-regulation strategies and MVPA compared to the control group.
Methods
This study used a pretest-posttest control group design. Participants were recruited using ResearchMatch.org, electronic campus newsletters, and flyers posted in campus buildings 
and local businesses. Eligible volunteers were adults (≥18 years), diagnosed with T2DM, 
with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. Individuals were excluded if they were not physically able to engage 
in exercise, or if they were currently exercising regularly. Individuals were randomized into 
either the experimental or control group. The Institutional Review Board at The Ohio State 
University approved all procedures.
Three researchers received 6 weeks of training prior to the intervention to ensure con-
sistency of implementation across subjects. Researchers were not blinded to participant 
group. Both groups met individually with a researcher four times over five weeks (Figure 
1). The first and second visits were one week apart. Visit three was scheduled two weeks 
after visit two. The third and fourth visits were one week apart. During the first visit, both 
groups completed self-regulation measurements and received a BodyMedia armband to 
wear for seven days.
During the second visit, the intervention group received information regarding their 
measured PA habits, and a behavioral intervention that included goal setting, time man-
agement, and enlisting social support to help participants plan their weekly PA. Participants 
were given weekly PA logs and pedometers to self-monitor their PA for two weeks. The 
control group received information regarding their measured PA habits.
At session three, both groups received the BodyMedia armband to wear for seven days. 
The intervention group reviewed behavioral goals and identified barriers to PA. They set 
PA goals and self-monitored their PA.
The final visit had both groups completing the posttest self-regulation measurement and 
receiving information regarding their PA. The control group received written recommen-
dations for PA for adults with T2DM (Colberg et al., 2010), and a pedometer. Total study 
contact time, including measurement and intervention procedures, was approximately 100 
and 60 min for the intervention and control group, respectively.

Measures
PA was measured with the BodyMedia armband (Internet). Individuals wore the armband 
for seven days between the first and second (pretest) and third and fourth visits (posttest). 
The device measured minutes of MVPA, energy expenditure, sedentary time and number of 
steps, via sensors measuring: movement, heat flux, galvanic skin response, and skin tempera -
ture. Test-retest reliability and criterion validity have been established (Berntsen et al., 2010; 
Brazeau et al., 2011; Internet; Mignault, Onge, Karelis, Allison, & Rabasa-Lhoret, 2005).
On the Self- Regulation for Exercise Scale, participants rated how often they used self-reg-
ulation strategies during the past four weeks on a 5-point scale from ‘Never’ to ‘Very Often’ . 
Subscales ( α = .948) included: self-monitoring ( α = .668), goal setting ( α = .871), social sup -
port ( α = .793), self-reward (α  = .874), time management (α  = .806), and overcoming barriers 
(α = .74). A 3-stage expert panel review established face and content validity. Subscales were 
previously refined using confirmatory factor analysis (Hallam & Petosa, 1998).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics. Inferential statistics were not applied 
because of the small sample size. Upon inspection for normality, an outlier was observed for 
baseline minutes of MVPA per week and minutes of MVPA per day. These data points were 
removed from the analysis of minutes of MVPA per week and minutes of MVPA per day. 
Number of steps per day, caloric expenditure per day, and sedentary time were retained for 
this subject. Three Cohen’s d effect size measures were calculated per dependent variable to 
examine (Internet) the intervention group changes from pre-to post-test, (Bandura, 1991) the control group changes from pre- to post-test, and (Berntsen et al., 2010) the difference

between the intervention and control group at posttest. An effect size of 0.2 was considered 
low, 0.5 was considered medium, and 0.8 was large (Vincent, 2005).
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 23 participants enrolled in this pilot study (Figure 2). Sixteen were recruited from 
ResearchMatch.org. Table 1  displays the baseline characteristics for the intervention (n  = 12) 
and control (n = 11) groups. Both groups were, middle-aged, obese, and a majority female. 
The pretest and posttest self-regulation and MVPA values for both groups are presented in 
Tables 2 and 3. There were no differences between groups on any pretest variables.
Effects of the intervention
All effect sizes for MVPA and self-regulation are summarized in Table 4. There was a large 
effect for the intervention group on total self-regulation (3.15), self-monitoring (4.63), 
goal setting (3.17), social support (1.29), self-reward (1.98), time management (4.41), and 
overcoming barriers (2.25). There were also large differences between groups at posttest for 
total self-regulation (2.43), self-monitoring (3.75), goal setting (1.68), social support (1.33), 
self-reward (1.45), time management (2.35), and overcoming barriers (1.85).
There was a small effect of the intervention on total minutes of MVPA per week (−.22), 
minutes of MVPA per day (−.23), caloric expenditure (−.30), and sedentary time (.39) in the intervention group over time. There was a moderate effect on number of steps per day 
(.57). There were small differences between groups at posttest in caloric expenditure (.26) 
and sedentary time (.35), and moderate differences in number of steps per day (.77), minutes 
of MVPA per week (.64), and minutes of MVPA per day (.64).
Discussion
The brief behavioral intervention increased the use of self-regulatory strategies in a sample 
of overweight and obese adults with T2DM. This is consistent with previous research that 
successfully improved self-regulation for PA (Heiss & Petosa, 2015; Olson & McAuley, 2015). 
This study is novel in that few studies have targeted self-regulation to promote PA in adults with T2DM (Glasgow et al., 1992; Kirk et al., 2009; Plotnikoff et al., 2010; Tudor-Locke et 
al., 2004). This is important because researchers can efficiently target use of self-regulation 
skills to promote PA.
Minutes of MVPA per week, minutes of MVPA per day, and caloric expenditure 
decreased in both groups, and time spent being sedentary per day increased over time. The intervention had a positive impact on number of steps per day. The effect of behavioral 
interventions on MVPA in adults with T2DM has been mixed. Our results were similar 
to the First Step Program and the ADAPT trial, producing positive changes in number of 
steps, but no other dimensions of MVPA (Plotnikoff et al., 2010; Tudor-Locke et al., 2004). 
Other studies that were primarily phone- or Internet-based saw positive changes in PA, but 
changes were lost at follow-up (De Greef, Deforche, Tudor-Locke, & De Bourdeaudhuij, 2011; McKay, King, Eakin, Seeley, & Glasgow, 2001). It is important to note baseline values

for minutes of MVPA per week and minutes of MVPA per day in both groups suggest that 
the individuals were meeting PA guidelines prior to the start of the intervention (Colberg 
et al., 2010). This is inconsistent with national data suggesting only 31% of adults with Assessed for eligibility

T2DM meet PA guidelines (Nelson et al., 2002), and suggests that a ceiling effect may have 
resulted in the inability of MVPA minutes per week or per day to increase beyond base-
line. Although participants reported being inactive prior to the study, they were motivated 
change increase PA. It is possible that research protocol produced reactive effects resulting 
in inflated baseline values of MVPA. The findings of this study suggest that intervention 
increased steps of walking per day, but did little to improve other dimensions of MVPA.Table 1. Baseline characteristics for the intervention and the control group.

A limitation to this study is low power due to a small sample size, limiting the ability to 
perform inferential statistics. These results should be viewed as preliminary, and the effect 
sizes obtained from this pilot study can serve to inform the design of subsequent, optimally 
powered trials using this intervention. Another limitation is that we recruited motivated 
volunteers, not randomly selected from the population. Results from this study should not 
be generalized beyond this sample. Finally, the measures of MVPA should be considered 
within the limitations of the BodyMedia. First, this device cannot differentiate bouts of 
PA. Also, individuals were not meeting the guidelines for the number of steps per day at 
baseline despite adequate minutes of MVPA. The discrepancy between minutes per day 
and steps per day requires further examination. Given that the BodyMedia is worn on the 
arm, it may have overestimated MVPA by recording upper body movements independent 
of full body activity or steps.
This pilot study provided preliminary evidence that a brief behavioral intervention can 
have a meaningful effect on the use of self-regulation strategies among a sample of over -
weight and obese adults with T2DM. However, this study did not have a meaningful impact 
on dimensions of MVPA. Given the importance of regular PA for adults with T2DM, it is Table 3.  Pretest and posttest values for dimensions of P a for the intervention group and the control
