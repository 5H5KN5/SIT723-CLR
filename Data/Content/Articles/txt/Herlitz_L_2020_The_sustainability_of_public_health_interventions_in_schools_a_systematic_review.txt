SYSTEMATIC REVIEW Open Access
The sustainability of public health
interventions in schools: a systematic
review
Lauren Herlitz1,2*, Helen MacIntyre3, Tom Osborn1and Chris Bonell1
Abstract
Background: The sustainability of school-based health interventions after external funds and/or other resources
end has been relatively unexplored in comparison to health care. If effective interventions discontinue, new
practices cannot reach wider student populations and investment in implementation is wasted. This review asked:
What evidence exists about the sustainability of school-based public health interventions? Do schools sustain public
health interventions once start-up funds end? What are the barriers and facilitators affecting the sustainability of
public health interventions in schools in high-income countries?
Methods: Seven bibliographic databases and 15 websites were searched. References and citations of included
studies were searched, and experts and authors were contacted to identify relevant studies. We included reports
published from 1996 onwards. References were screened on title/abstract, and those included were screened on
full report. We conducted data extraction and appraisal using an existing tool. Extracted data were qualitatively
synthesised for common themes, using May ’s General Theory of Implementation (2013) as a conceptual framework.
Results: Of the 9677 unique references identified through database searching and other search strategies, 24
studies of 18 interventions were included in the review. No interventions were sustained in their entirety; all had
some components that were sustained by some schools or staff, bar one that was completely discontinued. No
discernible relationship was found between evidence of effectiveness and sustainability. Key facilitators included
commitment/support from senior leaders, staff observing a positive impact on students ’engagement and
wellbeing, and staff confidence in delivering health promotion and belief in its value. Important contextual barriers
emerged: the norm of prioritising educational outcomes under time and resource constraints, insufficient funding/
resources, staff turnover and a lack of ongoing training. Adaptation of the intervention to existing routines and
changing contexts appeared to be part of the sustainability process.
Conclusions: Existing evidence suggests that sustainability depends upon schools developing and retaining senior
leaders and staff that are knowledgeable, skilled and motivated to continue delivering health promotion through
ever-changing circumstances. Evidence of effectiveness did not appear to be an influential factor. However,
methodologically stronger primary research, informed by theory, is needed.
Trial registration: The review was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42017076320 , Sep. 2017.

Background
Since the late 1980s, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has emphasised schools ’role in promoting
health [ 1,2]. Increasingly, randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) are used to determine the effectiveness of
school-based interventions addressing various health
outcomes [ 3–8]. While there has been progress in asses-
sing the effectiveness of such interventions [ 9–11], and
factors affecting implementation [ 12–14], there is less
evidence about sustaining health interventions in schools
beyond initial pilots. If effective interventions discon-
tinue, new practices cannot reach wider populations and
investments in time, people and resources to initiate and
implement them may be wasted [ 15–18].
Sustainability is a relatively new area of study [ 19], and
most studies come from health care [ 19,20]. Conceptual
frameworks for sustainability emphasise complexity,
whereby practitioners and other actors individually and
collectively engage with intervention components and
organisational systems to embed, adapt or discard inter-
ventions [ 21–23]. Factors suggested as promoting sustain-
ability include intervention effectiveness, attributes and
cost [ 15,17,24]; practitioners ’attributes and activities [ 21,
24]; the work of intervention champions and organisa-
tional leaders [ 25,26]; organisational climate and culture;
monitoring and evaluation; staff turnover [ 25,27]; and
the external political and financial climate [ 26].
While health and education settings may share barriers
and facilitators to sustaining new interventions, somefactors may differentially affect schools. There may be
less political incentive to sustain health interventions;
academic education is likely to be prioritised [ 28–30].
Teachers may need more support and preparation time
to deliver curriculums that include health [ 31] and vary
in their commitment to teaching health promotion [ 13,
31]. Limited interaction between schools and the health
sector might impede the identification of funding, re-
sources and training for sustainability [ 30]. Monitoring
ongoing effectiveness might be difficult without routine
collection of health data [ 30].
There has been no systematic review of the sustain-
ability of school-based health interventions. Stirman
et al.’s systematic review of research on the sustainability
of health interventions found 125 empirical studies
published 1980 to 2012 but did not focus on particular
settings; only 14 studies assessed school-based interven-
tions [ 20]. Believing a review of school interventions
could prove fruitful, we aimed to examine empirical re-
search on the sustainability of health interventions in
schools after start-up funding and/or other resources
ceased. As the resources available to schools will likely
impact on sustainability, we focus on high-income coun-
tries only. The review asks: what evidence exists about
the sustainability of school-based health interventions?
Do schools sustain public health interventions once
start-up funds end? What are the barriers and facilitators
affecting the sustainability of public-health interventions
in schools in high-income countries?
Method
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
A study was included if it:
/C15Focused on the (dis)continuation of a school-based
public-health intervention within the set of schools
originally involved in delivering it, and fieldwork was
carried out after external funding and/or other re-
sources to implement the intervention had ended
/C15Used qualitative or quantitative empirical methods
/C15Was published since 1996 (as these were judged
most relevant to current policy contexts) and
conducted in an Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) country
/C15The intervention:
i. Had defined components to be delivered
ii. Targeted children aged 5 –18 years
iii. Included health outcomes among its primary
outcomes
iv. Focused on obesity/overweight/body size; physical
activity/sedentary behaviours; nutrition; tobacco,Contributions to the literature
/C15Studies in health care settings have shown that multiple
facilitators and barriers affect the sustainability of health
interventions beyond effectiveness evaluations and the
cessation of funding and/or other resources. This review is
the first to apply this evidence-based intervention sustain-
ability in school settings.
/C15Although we found many commonalities in sustainability
factors between education and health care —for example,
funding, the work of organisational leaders and staff
turnover —we found staff lacked confidence in delivering
health promotion without ongoing support and prioritised
academic education over health. Perceived effectiveness
through witnessing students ’engagement and wellbeing
was influential; scientific evidence of effectiveness did not
appear to affect sustainability.
/C15These findings contribute to our understanding of whether,
how and why health interventions are sustained, adapted, or
discontinued in schools and their ability to have a lasting
impact on health outcomes.Herlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 2 of 28
alcohol/drug use; sexual health; mental health/
emotional well-being; violence; bullying; infectious
diseases; safety/accident prevention; body-image/
eating disorders; skin/sun safety; and oral health
[10]
v. Was implemented partly/wholly within school
during school hours by teachers, pastoral,
managerial or administrative staff, health or
wellbeing professionals employed by the school or
students
vi. Encompassed one or more elements of the Health
Promoting Schools (HPS) model [ 10]:a formal
curriculum —health education with allocated class
time to help students develop the knowledge,
attitudes and skills needed for healthy choices;
school ethos or environment —policies or activities
outside the curriculum that promote healthy values
and attitudes within school; and/or family and/or
community engagement —activities engaging
families, outside agencies and/or the community
Interventions were excluded if they provided health-in-
formation materials only, created new schools or were pri-
marily family/community-based interventions with a
minor school component. Interventions which co-located
a health service within schools, with services delivered ex-
clusively by clinical providers, were also excluded. The
sustainability of such interventions is likely to differ from
those delivered partly/wholly by educators or school em-
ployees, for example, greater reliance on schools continu-
ing to commission services or the option of service
provision at no cost to the school (i.e. through other fund-
ing mechanisms), and differences in clinicians and educa-
tors’commitment to sustainability due to differing
professional knowledge/roles, peer support and priorities.
Search strategy
We searched electronic databases for English-language
publications between January 1996 and September 2017
(PsycINFO, Social Sciences Citation Index –Social Sci-
ence & Humanities [Web of Science], British Education
Index, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and ERIC). A
mixture of free-text and controlled terms was searched
in titles/abstracts, and MESH headings where relevant.
Synonyms for four concepts were combined: sustainability,
school, intervention and public health (see Additional file 1
for full terms used). A comprehensive website search was
also carried out (see Additional file 2). School-based studies
in Stirman et al. ’s review were also screened [ 20]. The refer-
ences of included studies we re checked, and a citation
search was conducted on Google Scholar. Subject-matter
experts were contacted to iden tify unpublished/current
research, including authors of included studies (see
Additional file 3).Screening
All identified studies were imported into the data-
management software EPPI-Reviewer 4 [ 32]. Fifty arti-
cles were initially double-screened by two reviewers (LH,
HM) on title/abstract: 94% agreement was achieved and
discrepancies were discussed to reach a consensus. Re-
viewers then worked independently, single-screening on
title/abstract. Studies were retained if they met the inclu-
sion criteria or if there was insufficient information in
the title/abstract to judge. Full-text copies of potentially
relevant papers were retrieved and screened independ-
ently by the two reviewers to decide on inclusion. If
there was uncertainty, studies were discussed by both re-
viewers (LH, HM) until a consensus was reached, involv-
ing a third reviewer (CB) when necessary.
Data extraction and quality appraisal
We extracted data from each included report on study
sample/population; description of the intervention
(adapted criteria [ 33]); key dates, study design/method-
ology and results for the evaluation of effectiveness (or
implementation period for non-evaluated initiatives) and
sustainability phase; and information needed for quality
appraisal (see Additional file 4). Two reviewers (LH,
HM) extracted data from two study reports, comparing
their results. Pairs of reviewers (LH, HM or LH, TO) in-
dependently completed data extraction for each included
report. Differences between reviewers were discussed, in-
cluding a third reviewer (CB) where necessary.
Two reviewers assessed study reliability using an exist-
ing checklist [ 34]: justification for study focus and
methods used; clear aims/objectives; clear description of
context, sample and methodology; demonstrated at-
tempts to establishing data reliability and validity; and
inclusion of original data. Studies were assigned two
‘weight-of-evidence ’ratings [ 35], one for reliability and
one for relevance to answer the review question, rated
‘low’,‘medium ’or‘high’. To achieve ‘high’reliability, at
least five criteria had to be met, for ‘medium ’at least
four criteria had to be fully or partially met, and all other
studies were rated ‘low’. We also downgraded the reli-
ability of retrospective, cross-sectional studies using self-
report data for interventions implemented more than
2 years ago. For a judgement of ‘high’relevance, studies
had to describe, with breadth and depth, factors influen-
cing sustainability and privilege participants ’perspectives
(Additional file 5describes quality criteria and ratings).
Studies were not excluded from the synthesis based on
their reliability, but greater qualitative weight was given
to those assessed as ‘medium ’or‘high’. The quality-
assessment tool was piloted on two studies by each pair
of reviewers (LH, HM and LH, TO) with results dis-
cussed to ensure consistency. Each included study was
then independently quality-assessed by each reviewerHerlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 3 of 28
with discrepancies discussed, where necessary resolved
with a third reviewer (CB).
Synthesis of results
We originally intended to use a meta-ethnographic ap-
proach as submitted in the protocol [ 36]. We anticipated
finding qualitative studies that were rich in concepts,
metaphors and description. However, only one study
went beyond description to interpret participants ’views
and experiences, and it was not possible to ‘translate ’
and synthesise concepts from one study into another. In-
stead, we conducted thematic synthesis [ 37] to develop
concepts from the mixture of qualitative, quantitative
and mixed studies identified. One reviewer (LH) read
and re-read studies and carried out line-by-line coding
using NVivo 11 software. Inductive codes were devel-
oped from the qualitative data (participants ’verbatim
quotes and authors ’interpretations) and from authors ’
textual reports of quantitative findings. Each code ’s data
were checked for consistency of interpretation and re-
coded as necessary. We used the General Theory of Im-
plementation (GTI [ 38]) as a sensitising lens; it explains
how implementation proceeds over time, building on
normalization process theory [ 21,39] (Fig. 1summarises
the theory ’s constructs). Memos were used to explain
codes, their relationships and their alignment with the
GTI. GTI informed the overarching structure of themesand sub-themes that was developed. The reliability of
each study was checked and referred to as the overall
themes were incorporated into a narrative synthesis. The
three other reviewers (HM, TO, CB) commented on and
discussed a draft of the themes and sub-themes, and a
final version was agreed.
This review was registered on PROSPERO (6.9.17,
CRD42017076320, [ 36]) and follows PRISMA reporting
standards (Additional File 6).
Results
Of the 9670 unique title/abstracts generated through
database-searching (see Fig. 2), we included 20 reports
of 19 studies. Other search strategies yielded seven add-
itional reports from five studies. Data extraction was
completed for these 24 studies; extraction was not con-
ducted on three doctoral theses [ 40–42] because each
had a corresponding published paper of the same study
included in the review [ 43–45]. In total, the review in-
cluded 24 studies of 18 different interventions.
Study characteristics
Study origin
Seventeen of the 24 studies were based in the United
States (US), of which seven were studies of the Child
and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATC
H) intervention [ 44–60] and the remainder were from

Norway [ 43,61], the Netherlands [ 62,63], Canada [ 64],
England [ 65] and Germany [ 66].
Intervention characteristics and effectiveness
The largest group of interventions focused on healthy
eating and/or physical activity ( n= 10); the remainder
targeted anti-social behaviour ( n= 2), mental health ( n=
2), alcohol/drug use ( n= 2), peer and dating violence
(n= 1) and workplace health-and-safety ( n= 1) (see
Table 1). Nine were based in elementary/primary
schools, eight in middle/high/secondary schools and one
in both settings. Intervention length, as initially funded/
implemented, ranged from 8 weeks to 3 years (mode = 1
year); three interventions were of unspecified length.During initial implementation in schools prior to
assessing sustainability, effectiveness evaluations were
conducted of 15 interventions; three were not evaluated
[53,62,63], though one [ 63] had been assessed by RCT
in other schools [ 75] (see Table 1). Of the effectiveness
evaluations, six interventions (relating to 12 studies)
were assessed by RCTs [ 47–49,51,52,55,56,58,60,61,
64,66], two by using non-randomised controlled studies
[59,65] and seven by uncontrolled evaluations [ 43–46,
50,54,57]; evaluation reports were inaccessible for three
interventions). Of the 12 interventions for which evalu-
ation reports were available, five interventions were ef-
fective for all primary outcomes, six interventions were
effective for some but not all primary outcomes and oneFig. 2 PRISMA flow diagram of study selection processHerlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 5 of 28

Study design/methods
Ten studies of sustainability used quantitative cross-
sectional designs (42%) [ 50–54,56,59,60,64,66], and
one study employed a quantitative longitudinal design
[61] (see Table 2). All except one of these used question-
naires to examine sustainability. Six studies employed
qualitative designs [ 43–46,48,58]. Seven studies used
mixed-methods [ 47,49,55,57,62,63,65]. Ten studies
(42%) used a comparison group of schools [ 47–49,51–53,
55,56,61,65].
Timeframe examined
Timeframes between the effectiv eness evaluation (or imple-
mentation period in non-evaluat ed initiatives) and the study
of sustainability varied (Table 1). Five studies examined sus-
tainability less than a year after t he effectiveness evaluation
[44,45,50,58,66]. Four were conducted 1 to 2 years later
[47,61,63,65]; ten took place 2 to 5 years after the evalu-
ation [ 47,49,50,52,53,56–58,61,65] and five examined
sustainability more than 5 years later [ 43,53,54,59,62].
Study participants
Six studies sampled several classroom teachers per
school [ 44,45,50,52,64,65], and six of the CATCH
studies sampled multiple staff members and/or school-
district level personnel per school [ 48,49,51,55,56,60]
(see Additional file 7). Three studies sampled school
principals only [ 43,62,66], four sampled one teacher or
staff-member per school [ 47,54,59,63]a n do n es a m p l e d
clinicians delivering the intervention plus school-district
level personnel [ 46]. Three collected data from students
[45,61,65], and one interviewed the research team imple-
menting the intervention [ 45]. Three studies provided no
details on staff-level participants [ 53,57,58].
Study quality
Study reliability and relevance varied. On reliability,
seven studies were rated high, nine medium and eight
low. On relevance for answering the review question,
four studies were rated high, ten medium and ten
low. Only one study was rated high on relevance and
reliability [ 46]( s e eT a b l e 2).
Explicit use of conceptual framework
Most studies did not use a conceptual theory/frame-
work. Of those that did ( n= 9), a variety of sustainability
[17,76–79] and implementation frameworks [ 80–82]
were used. Only one study [ 43] drew on conceptual
frameworks specific to educational settings [ 83].Reporting of sustainability
Eleven studies reported on intervention sustainability at
school-level [ 43,45,47,53,57,58,60–63,66], ten at
staff-level [ 44,46,48–52,54,64,65], two at the school-
and staff-level [ 55,56] and one at school-district and
school-level [ 59] (Table 2). Seventy-six percent of studies
with a curriculum component [ 45,47–53,56–58,64,
65], 67% of studies with a school-environment compo-
nent [ 43–47,53,55,57,61,66] and one third of studies
containing a family/community component reported on
its sustainability [ 45,46,48,53] (see Table 3). Around
half of studies (46%) of multi-component interventions
reported sustainability of some but not all components.
Sustainability of the interventions
No interventions were entirely sustained; Table 3sum-
marises the percentage of staff or schools sustaining
each component. Studies were heterogeneous: all inter-
ventions had some components that were continued by
some schools or staff, except for one intervention that
was completely discontinued two years after the effect-
iveness evaluation [ 46]. There were no noticeable pat-
terns between evidence of effectiveness during
implementation and sustainability, unaided by inconsist-
ency and gaps in the reporting of sustainability and evi-
dence of effectiveness (see Table 4).
Thematic synthesis of barriers and facilitators of
sustainability
Four overarching themes emerged: three themes broadly
aligned with three of the four main constructs of the
GTI framework (see Fig. 1) and the fourth described the
wider policy context (see Table 5). Themes were schools ’
capacity to sustain health interventions (GTI construct
‘capacity ’), staff ’s motivation and commitment (GTI con-
struct ‘potential ’), intervention adaptation and integra-
tion (GTI construct ‘capability ’) and wider policy context
for health promotion. We found that the fourth GTI
construct of ‘contribution ’was implicated within the
other themes (we highlight where this occurs) and com-
ment on this further in the discussion. Themes and sub-
themes are described below.
Theme 1: Schools ’capacity to sustain health interventions
Schools ’social norms, staff roles, resources and systems
were reported to influence sustainability. Five sub-
themes developed from 20 studies of 14 interventions
[43–49,51–59,63–66].
1. Educational outcomes took precedence over health
promotion

teaching the academic curriculum, meeting educationalHerlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 10 of 28

23% of teachers in FI schools used CATCH
health education materials, compared to
11% in CG1 schools and 0% in CG2 schools.
69% of teachers in FI schools taught zero
hours of CATCH in the current school year,

8 CATCH –school climate ; Parcel et al. 2003 [ 60] Schools in which principals and teachers
were more open were sig. more likely to
be teaching more hours of CATCH. ‘Open ’
principals were supportive, low on rigid
monitoring/control and low on
restrictiveness. ‘Open ’teachers were highly
collegial, had a network of social support
and were engaged with school.
Schools in which principals and teacher
were more open, and schools higher in
organisational health, were sig. more likely
to have a greater percentage of calories
from saturated fat in school lunches.

vigorous physical activity. All study groups
exceeded the CATCH goal of 90 min of
PE/week. Teachers reported teaching only
about two CATCH lessons during the
previous school year, a much lower dosage
than the original intervention.
Over 88% of PE teachers and 60% of
classroom teachers reported using the
CATCH PE activity box in the previous
school year.30% of FI schools achieved the total fat
goal of < 30%, compared to 10% of CG1
schools and 17% CG2 schools. 45% of FI
schools achieved the saturated fat goal
of < 10%, compared to 30% of CG1

standards and regulations. Under time constraints,
health promotion was considered dispensable, a theme
that arose from nine studies (high and medium reliabil-
ity) of six interventions focused on physical activity,
healthy eating and mental health [ 43,44,46,48,49,52,
56,65]. A district-level informant from the CATCH
study commented:
…if you ’re going to prioritize, you ’re going to
prioritize on academics. ...You always concentrate on
academics but there was more room for PE and
health and those kinds of things before the state
kicked in the really extremely rigorous academic
standards. ([ 48], p. 515)
There were some exceptions where principals or admin-
istrators encouraged staff to focus on health [ 43,46,48],
but the prevailing norm was to focus on academic
attainment.
2. Staff members ’roles in sustainability
Staff members ’roles and autonomy were reported to
affect whether interventions were sustained at school-level
or solely by individual practitioners. Two deeper sub-
themes emerged: the importance of the principal and
administration, and teachers ’autonomy in the classroom.
i)The importance of the principal and school
administration
Commitment and support from the principal and ad-
ministration (including the school district in US studies)
were considered crucial to ‘pave the way ’for sustainabil-
ity [46], a sub-theme identified in 12 studies of 11 inter-
ventions [ 43,45–48,52–54,59,63–65]. Senior staff had
the power to stop or continue an intervention at school-
level through authorisation [ 46,48], re-distributing
school funds to or away from interventions [ 45,47], allo-
cating time for delivery [ 43,46,47] and providing train-
ing for new staff [ 43,47,63] (see sub-theme 4 (i) ‘Staff
turnover ’in the ‘Theme 1: Schools ’capacity to sustain
health interventions ’section).
Beyond resources, principals/administrators could
demonstrate their commitment through integrating the
intervention into school policies [ 43], recruiting new
staff who were well-disposed to it [ 63], giving staff
positive recognition [ 43,53,64] and managing staff to
ensure that they continued [ 43]. The principal had a key
role in continuing to enrol staff in a community of prac-
tice and persuading staff that it was right for them to
address health [ 43]. This sub-theme overlaps with the
GTI domain ‘cognitive participation ’under the construct
‘contribution ’.ii)Teachers ’autonomy in the classroom
Four studies of four interventions (high and medium
reliability) indicated that teachers had autonomy to de-
cide whether to sustain interventions in their classroom,
within the bounds of the curriculum and principals ’
leadership [ 43,44,48,65]. Other studies revealed that if
teachers sustained interventions, they could adapt them
as they deemed appropriate (see sub-theme 1 ‘The work-
ability of the intervention ’in the ‘Theme 3: Intervention
adaptation and integration ’section). One teacher from a
US study of CATCH reported [ 48]:
It is an individual decision. The state has a framework
of what we are supposed to teach. We are asked to
teach the things that the district recommends, but if
you have more time, you can teach other things as
well. No one has asked us to use the CATCH
curriculum since the program ended in our school so
it was up to us. ([ 48], p. 509)
There were some examples of collective action among
teachers (reflecting GTI domain ‘collective action ’under
‘contribution ’). Two US studies (medium and high reli-
ability) of physical-activity interventions showed teachers
working together to plan and develop ideas [ 44] and to
encourage the principal to raise funds for sustainability
[45]. There was an example of staff receiving logistical
support [ 46] and providing internal training to other
staff [ 48]. The piecemeal evidence for collective action
may reflect the lack of attention given to this factor in
the studies or a norm that teachers ’work with an inter-
vention beyond the evaluation of effectiveness is typically
independent.
3. Funding and material resources
Insufficient funding, equipment, materials and/or
physical space could lead to discontinuation, cause logis-
tical challenges [ 43,47,64] or become a reason for adap-
tation (see sub-theme 1 ‘The workability of the
intervention ’in the ‘Theme 3: Intervention adaptation
and integration ’section), a sub-theme developed from
16 studies of 11 interventions [ 45–49,51,52,54–59,63,
64,66]. A lack of resources could motivate schools to
seek out external funds via fundraising, grants or assist-
ance from school-related associations [ 48,57,58,66], re-
distribute school budgets [ 45] or find alternative means
such as volunteers or parental payments [ 47,57,66]. As
one study (medium reliability) of an all-girls physical-
activity intervention reported:
Lack of finances was mentioned as a reason that
teachers did not offer guest instructors or hold weeklyHerlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 21 of 28
lunch bunches. Whereas some teachers asked for
volunteers to teach yoga or dance, others used videos
or asked students to pay a $5 activities fee at the
beginning of the class to use for guest instructors ’
fees. ([ 47], p. 5)
4. Cognitive resources
Schools needed to retain the knowledge, skills and ex-
perience to sustain the intervention. Two deeper sub-
themes emerged related to staff turnover and the im-
portance of training.
i)Staff turnover
Fifteen studies of ten interventions described the ad-
verse impact of staff turnover. As staff left, organisa-
tional knowledge, enthusiasm and the co-ordination of
the intervention could dissipate [ 43,46–49,51–53,55,
56,58,59,63–65]. A change in principal [ 43,48,63]o r
loss of a champion (a senior staff member who advo-
cated and assumed responsibility for intervention coord-
ination and integrity) could jeopardise sustainability [ 46,
58,62]. New decision-makers did not always share en-
thusiasm for the intervention or had other priorities, as
a clinician from one highly reliable US study of a
mental-health intervention explained:
We’ve lost a major senior administrator that is
proactive and advocated for the kids ’needs, across the
board, regular education and special education.
Things have changed. Within the last year, they ’re just
looking at all the academics right now. ([ 46], p. 138)
ii)The importance of training
A lack of training for new teachers or booster training
was a barrier to sustainability, a sub-theme emerging
from 12 studies of nine interventions [ 43,46–49,51–53,
56,59,64,65]. One Dutch study (medium reliability) of
an intervention to reduce aggressive behaviour found a
designated school co-ordinator to train and coach
teachers facilitated sustainability [ 63]. As well as giving
staff the skills and knowledge for delivery, training could
generate enthusiasm and communicate the interven-
tion’s philosophy [ 47,48], as described by a teacher from
a US study (medium reliability) of CATCH:
The staff development was interesting and motivated
teachers. They learned about nutrition and fitness.
They got excited about it and therefore implemented
it. And that made it difficult to implement in schoolsthat had not had the training. They missed a real
motivational surge and missed looking at the
importance and hearing from experts. ([ 48], p. 515)
5. Social resources
Schools ’networks with other schools, community or-
ganisations and funding agencies appeared to influence
sustainability, a sub-theme emerging from four studies
(high, medium and low reliability) of four interventions
[43,45,48,58]. Strong social links could give schools ac-
cess to funding [ 58] and training [ 48], and collaborations
with community organisations and other schools could mo-
tivate schools to maintain a nd develop interventions [ 43].
Theme 2: Staff motivation and commitment
Five sub-themes emerged on staff motivation and com-
mitment to sustain health interventions from 18 studies
of 15 interventions [ 43–50,52,53,55,59,60,62–66].
1. Observing and evaluating effectiveness
Directly observing the benefits for students ’engage-
ment, wellbeing and behaviour was a strong motivator to
continue [ 43–50,52,63,65,66]. No staff referred to the
findings of the effectiveness evaluation when discussing
the intervention ’s value, though a clinician in one study
commented seeing a change in students based on a ‘pre
and post test ’[46]. Conversely, negative responses from
students could be a barrier [ 48,55,64]. For example, a
teacher from a Dutch study (medium reliability) of an
intervention to reduce aggressive behaviour reported:
It gives the team power. And, especially now, with
more children with behavioral problems in the
classroom. When you stay on the positive side, almost
all children will get along. ([ 63], p. 85)
Two studies (high reliability) asked students about their
experiences of physical activity interventions [ 45,65]a n d
found they had little decision-making power over what ac-
tivities were sustained; they were willing participants, but
opportunities were largely dictated by their families or the
school. For example, a student commented on a compo-
nent discontinued due to time constraints (as reported by
teachers):
Taylor said, ‘We started these warmups, and then they
stopped. I don ’t know why, but I wish we had them. It is
hard to run the CV day with no warmup. ’([65], p. 114)
Only four studies (one high, two medium and one low
reliability) of four interventions referred to more formalHerlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 22 of 28
processes to appraise effectiveness [ 43,46,59,63], over-
lapping with the GTI domain of ‘reflexive monitoring ’
under ‘contribution ’. Two studies found no differences
in sustainability between schools with procedures for
reviewing the intervention and those without [ 59,63].
One study (medium reliability) reported principals who
sustained the intervention regularly evaluated health-
promotion activities.
2. Staff confidence in delivering health promotion
Staff who had been trained in the intervention felt
more confident and better prepared to deliver it [ 47–49,
52,64] (see sub-theme 4 (ii) ‘The importance of training ’
in the ‘Theme 1: Schools ’capacity to sustain health in-
terventions ’section). Teachers delivering an intervention
outside of their usual expertise were less likely to sustain
it [43,47–50,64,65], for example, PE teachers delivering
nutrition education [ 47] or classroom teachers delivering
PE [43,48–50,65]:
Among classroom teachers, feeling inadequately
prepared to implement PE was frequently reported;
and in many cases, teachers had little interest in
gaining the skill. ([ 49], p. 471)
3. Parent support
Five studies noted parent support in a general sense
was helpful [ 43,45,52,59,64]. Four studies covered
parent support in more depth; staff indicated how lack
of parent support could reduce their motivation to sus-
tain an intervention [ 46,48,62,65]. This sub-theme
overlaps with the GTI domain ‘coherence ’under ‘contri-
bution ’. A teacher from an English study (high reliability)
of a physical-activity intervention explained:
I think a lot of it is home life, if the parents don ’t
push them towards sporting activities then you ’re
fighting a battle straight away in school. ([ 65], p. 8)
4. Believing in the importance of the intervention
Belief in the importance of the intervention motivated
staff to sustain it, a sub-theme arising from seven studies
of six interventions [ 43,44,46–49,52,63] and was re-
lated to the importance of training (sub-theme 4 (ii)
‘The importance of training ’in the ‘Theme 1: Schools ’
capacity to sustain health interventions ’section) and ob-
serving intervention effectiveness (sub-theme 1 ‘Observ-
ing and evaluating effectiveness ’in the ‘Theme 2: Staff
motivation and commitment ’section). Principals whoreported sustaining a 3-year HPS intervention in
Norway, which aimed to create a positive school envir-
onment for health, were keen to communicate its
importance:
School satisfaction and safety are at the bottom of this
school. It is under the teachers ’skin and in our walls.
We work with this no matter what is on our agenda.
([43], p. 59)
5. The impact of school climate
There was limited evidence on the impact of staff percep-
tion of the school climate. One highly reliable US study of
CATCH suggested climate mig ht differentially impact on
different interventions: a po sitive climate was associated
with more teaching hours of the CATCH curriculum but
higher levels of saturated fat in school meals [ 60]. Respon-
dents in two other studies (medium and high reliability) re-
ported that a negative climate meant that sustainability
processes were superseded by m ore critical organisational
priorities [ 46,63]. One US study (low reliability) of a work-
place health-and-safety inter vention found no relationship
between climate and sustainability.
Theme 3: Intervention adaptation and integration
Schools ’ability to sustain an intervention was affected
by its ‘workability ’—the degree to which it could be
shaped into existing school practices and routines, and
its integration into school policies and plans. These two
sub-themes emerged from 18 studies of 13 interventions
[43–49,52–56,58,60,63–66].
1. The workability of the intervention
Three deeper sub-themes transpired: fitting the inter-
vention into the time available, matching the interven-
tion to students ’needs and the need for up-to-date
equipment and materials.
i)Fitting the intervention into the time available
Frequently, staff identified that interventions required
too much time, time which was primarily devoted to de-
livering the curriculum (see sub-theme 1 ‘Educational
outcomes took precedence over health promotion ’in the
‘Theme 1: Schools ’capacity to sustain health interven-
tions’section) [ 44–46,48,49,52–56,63–65]. Staff dealt
with time constraints by reducing or dropping com-
ponents [ 45,47,64,65], or making time for the inter-
vention by adapting it to classroom routines [ 44,50]
or incorporating elements of it into the existing cur-
riculum [ 48,52,53,56,58,65].Herlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 23 of 28
ii)Matching the intervention to students ’needs
Adaptation was also important to match the needs of
different cohorts of students, to offer the intervention to
different grades [ 53,63], better fit students ’learning
abilities or make lessons more contextually relevant
[43,54], devote more time to particular activities to
ensure students understood a subject or better engage
students [ 46,64].
iii)The need for up-to-date materials
Over time, new equipment and materials were needed
as equipment grew worn or was lost [ 49], materials be-
came dated [ 48,53,64], new technological advances
emerged [ 50,64] or adaptations were needed to meet
students ’needs [ 53,54,64].
2. Integration of the intervention with school policies
and plans
One Dutch study of an intervention to reduce aggres-
sive behaviour and one Norwegian study of an HPS
intervention (medium reliability) reported that schools
with greater sustainability more often made reference to
it in school policies or plans [ 43,63]. Studies suggested
formal documentation signalled principals ’and adminis-
trators ’commitment to the intervention [ 63], legitimised
it [48,63], made staff accountable [ 43] or made the
intervention resilient to staff turnover [ 43] (see sub-
theme 4 (i) ‘Staff turnover ’in the ‘Theme 1: Schools ’
capacity to sustain health interventions ’).
Theme 4: Wider policy context for health promotion
The wider policy context could also affect sustainability,
a thematic area positioned outside of the GTI frame-
work, emerging from seven studies of five interventions.
Regional or national health policies could support sus-
tainability by legitimising health promotion in schools ’
policies [ 43,48] (see sub-theme 1 ‘Educational outcomes
took precedence over health promotion ’in the ‘Theme
1: Schools ’capacity to sustain health interventions ’sec-
tion). Over time, health policies could shape social
norms: for example, increasing tobacco-control regula-
tions could enhance the sustainability of outdoor-
smoking bans in schools [ 62]. Policy could also provide
funding and resources [ 55,57], though additional re-
sources could also lead to competing interventions, po-
tentially displacing existing ones [ 55,56].
Discussion
Summary of key findings
The sustainability of public health interventions after
start-up funding and/or other resources end has beenrelatively uncharted in schools compared to health care.
We identified 24 studies assessing the sustainability of
school-based health interventions delivered partly/wholly
by educators or school-employed health professionals,
but quality was not consistently high. None of the inter-
ventions assessed were fully sustained; all had compo-
nents sustained by some schools or staff, bar one that
was completely discontinued. Identifying common facili-
tators and barriers could help researchers and providers
optimise the sustainability of school interventions, and
consider whether/how the intervention is likely to have a
lasting impact on student and staff health. Two key facil-
itators emerged. First is the central importance of a
committed principal and administration that could au-
thorise continuation, allocate resources, integrate the
intervention into school policies and enrol new staff into
a community of practice. Second is the importance of
supporting staff who are confident in delivering health
promotion and believe in its value. These facilitators are
consistent with studies of the implementation of school
health interventions [ 13,31,67], suggesting factors are
crucial to both phases.
Many of the facilitators and barriers to sustainability
identified for school settings were similar to those in
health care: for example, dedicated leaders, the need for
continued resources and training, staff turnover and inter-
vention workability [ 21,24–27]. Several factors were more
salient for schools. Health encompasses multiple out-
comes, some of which may be more obviously relevant to
school settings. We identified the sub-theme of educa-
tional outcomes taking precedence over physical activity,
nutrition and mental health interventions, but not for
those focused on anti-social or violent behaviour. This
suggests that throughout adoption and implementation,
change agents need to convince schools that health inter-
ventions can bring education benefits [ 30,68–70].
Student engagement was key to implementation and
sustainability at teacher-level. A central role of educators
is to engage students [ 29,71], and staff were unlikely to
sustain interventions that did not draw students in [ 48].
Sometimes sustainability was prompted by students ’re-
quests for the intervention [ 44,45]. Knowing parents en-
couraged the healthy activities of the intervention
outside of school also motivated staff to continue, fur-
ther supporting the view that schools are complex adap-
tive systems, where multiple networks of agents act and
react to one another [ 30]. In contrast, only 16% of the
62 sustainability approaches in Lennox et al. ’s review
[23] included patient involvement, suggesting that most
existing tools and frameworks for health care settings do
not consider patient support for the intervention critical
for sustainability.
Also of particular significance for schools was the need to
adapt intervention materials and activities to accommodateHerlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 24 of 28
other curriculum requirements and the diversity of
children ’s backgrounds and development [ 29,72].
This dynamic context suggests that intervention de-
velopers should anticipate the need for adaptation,
even for effective, well-implemented and funded
school health interventions [ 21,30,73].
Contrary to other studies of sustainability in health
care settings [ 20], we found little evidence that cham-
pions helped sustain interventions: like other staff,
champions moved to new institutions leaving interven-
tions at risk. We found no discernible relationship be-
tween evidence of effectiveness and sustainability, and
no school staff mentioned outcome evaluation as an in-
fluential factor in sustainability.
Strengths and limitations
Our review was comprehensive and rigorously con-
ducted. It is the first to apply the GTI to the study of
sustainability. We found the framework helpful in creat-
ing a balance between listing the common enablers and
barriers and representing the complexity and context-
dependent nature of sustainability in schools. The data
aligned well with the constructs of capacity (theme 1),
potential (theme 2) and capability (theme 3), while the
construct of contribution was implicated within the
other themes. It made sense to consider ‘cognitive par-
ticipation ’and‘collective action ’under the construct of
‘capacity ’as the ongoing enrolment of staff, the legitim-
isation of health activities, and whether staff worked in-
dependent or collectively appeared significantly affected
by schools ’social norms and roles. Under capacity, we
included an additional domain of ‘social resources ’
which suggested that contact between schools and other
organisations could facilitate sustainability through cre-
ating opportunities for resource- and knowledge-sharing,
while stimulating ongoing interest in the intervention.
Regarding limitations, we did not double-screen full
reports and we may have missed reports due to the array
of terms used to describe sustainability, despite our sen-
sitive search strategy. We deviated from our original
protocol in using thematic synthesis rather than meta-
ethnography due to the nature of studies found. We ex-
cluded interventions delivered by clinical services co-
located in schools, and consequently, our findings may
be less representative of the sustainability of targeted or
tiered services which typically require a high level of
clinical expertise (only 3 of the 24 interventions in the
review were targeted). The sustainability of health inter-
ventions provided solely by external clinicians is un-
known; for example, they could be more sustainable
because they do not require educators to expend time
gaining additional knowledge and skills, or they may be
less because they require sustained funding. There was
substantial heterogeneity in study designs, methods andreporting of included studies; many studies were meth-
odologically weak and did not report on the sustainabil-
ity of all components, in particular reporting for family/
community components was poor. Most studies were lo-
cated in the US, and consequently, our review findings
may be most relevant to this setting. Around half of in-
terventions focused on healthy eating/physical activity,
with a lack of evidence for the sustainability of other
public-health interventions.
Implications for research and policy
Informed by our synthesis, we propose three questions
to consider when optimising school health interventions.
First, is it important that each component is sustained?
Some components, such as needs assessment, may be
time-limited stepping-stones. Second (if a component is
to be sustained), how would you expect the intervention
to be sustained: if there were high staff turnover or the
loss of the champion, during time-pressured periods
such as exams, with different classes of students with
varying needs or if there were no opportunities for regu-
lar training updates? Third, do staff understand the key
theoretical principles that should underpin any adapta-
tions to intervention activities and resources? Creating
forums during the period of the evaluation of effective-
ness when these ‘stress-testing ’questions can be dis-
cussed with staff could help researchers to understand
the likely sustainability of interventions.
Stronger study designs/methodology are needed for fu-
ture research; there were few longitudinal studies pro-
spectively following intervention sustainability from
initial implementation. Increased use of conceptual the-
ory would enhance studies ’richness and breadth and
improve the analytic generalisability of findings. Student
engagement in the intervention should be considered a
key factor affecting both implementation and sustain-
ability processes. The inclusion of views from a range of
school participants, including students, would strengthen
the validity of findings. Improved reporting on sustain-
ability of allintervention components is key, with justifi-
cation provided for excluding specific components.
Research on the sustainability of interventions outside
health eating/physical activity is needed, for example,
there were no studies of sexual-health interventions, as
are studies of the sustainability of interventions delivered
by external providers co-located in schools.
Sustainability strategies contributed to our analysis
where authors commented on them in papers ’results
and discussions [ 43–45,52,64]. However, several papers
referred to specific sustainability strategies in their back-
ground sections but did not consider their impact in
their analysis of sustainability, including ‘train-the-
trainer ’models to spread the intervention across and be-
tween schools [ 58,63], external consultants exploringHerlitz et al. Implementation Science            (2020) 15:4 Page 25 of 28
adaptations with staff [ 53] and a staged-approach to im-
plementation [ 50]. Primary research on the impact of
implementation and sustainability strategies and plan-
ning would be valuable [ 74,84].
Our review suggests regional and/or national school
policies and educational standards that promote health
and wellbeing and its connection to students ’learning
and school enjoyment could enhance sustainability by
legitimising staff spending time, effort and resources on
continuation, as well as bringing funding and resources
to sustain health goals.
Conclusion
Multiple factors facilitating and prohibiting schools ’ability
to sustain health interventions emerged from the review,
and existing evidence suggests sustainability depends upon
schools developing and retaining senior leaders and staff
that are knowledgeable, skilled and motivated to continue
delivering health promotion through ever-changing cir-
cumstances. Evidence of intervention effectiveness did not
appear to be an influential factor. However, there is a sig-
nificant gap in our understanding of how to sustain inter-
ventions and methodologically stronger primary research,
informed by theory, is needed.
