Abstract
Background: Even under optimal internal organizational conditions, implementation can be undermined by
changes in organizations ’external environments, such as fluctuations in funding, adjustments in contracting
practices, new technology, new legislation, changes in clinical practice guidelines and recommendations, or other
environmental shifts. Internal organizational conditions are increasingly reflected in implementation frameworks, but
nuanced explanations of how organizations ’external environments influence implementation success are lacking in
implementation research. Organizational theories offer implementation researchers a host of existing, highly
relevant, and heretofore largely untapped explanations of the complex interaction between organizations and their
environment. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of organizational theories for implementation research.
Discussion: We applied four well-known organizational theories (institutional theory, transaction cost economics,
contingency theories, and resource dependency theory) to published descriptions of efforts to implement SafeCare,
an evidence-based practice for preventing child abuse and neglect. Transaction cost economics theory explained
how frequent, uncertain processes for contracting for SafeCare may have generated inefficiencies and thus
compromised implementation among private child welfare organizations. Institutional theory explained how child
welfare systems may have been motivated to implement SafeCare because doing so aligned with expectations of
key stakeholders within child welfare systems ’professional communities. Contingency theories explained how efforts
such as interagency collaborative teams promoted SafeCare implementation by facilitating adaptation to child
welfare agencies ’internal and external contexts. Resource dependency theory (RDT) explained how interagency
relationships, supported by contracts, memoranda of understanding, and negotiations, facilitated SafeCare
implementation by balancing autonomy and dependence on funding agencies and SafeCare developers.
Summary: In addition to the retrospective application of organizational theories demonstrated above, we advocate
for the proactive use of organizational theories to design implementation research. For example, implementation
strategies should be selected to minimize transaction costs, promote and maintain congruence between
organizations ’dynamic internal and external contexts over time, and simultaneously attend to organizations ’
financial needs while preserving their autonomy. We describe implications of applying organizational theory in
implementation research for implementation strategies, the evaluation of implementation efforts, measurement,
research design, theory, and practice. We also offer guidance to implementation researchers for applying
organizational theory.

Background
Over the past decade, the field of implementation science
has grown rapidly, with a devoted international journal,
new funding mechanisms, and other implementation-
related initiatives around the world. These investments
highlight the complexities of making change in real-world
care settings. We have learned, for example, how strong
leadership [1, 2], supportive organizational culture and cli-
mate [3], clinician buy-in and receptivity to change [4],
and robust consultation and supervision [5, 6] are all crit-
ical for implementation success.
Yet, even with optimal internal organizational condi-
tions, implementation can be undermined by changes in
organizations ’external environments, such as fluctuations
in funding, adjustments in contracting practices, new
technology, new legislation (e.g., requirements set forth in
the Affordable Care Act), changes in clinical practice
guidelines and recommendations, or other environmental
shifts [7 –11]. Internal organizational conditions are in-
creasingly reflected in implementation frameworks, focus-
ing on intra-organizational or inner context constructs
like structure, leadership, and social context. However, nu-
anced explanations of how organizations ’external envi-
ronments influence implementation success are generally
lacking in implementation research [12 –15].
Organizational theories offe r implementation researchers
a host of existing, highly relevant, and heretofore largely
untapped explanations of the complex interaction between
organizations and their environment. Organizational theor-
ies describe, explain, and pre dict the complex interaction
between organizations and their external environments.
Thus, these theories have potential to explain and ground
investigations focused on the role of policies, institutions,
funding fluctuations, contr act design, procurement pro-
cesses, and workforce dynamics in implementation.
With roots in management and sociology [16],
organizational theories have been used to explain phe-
nomena in the fields of education, human services, public
management, and health services research [17 –20].
Organizational sociologists have called for the use of
organizational theory in research on healthcare organiza-
tions [21] and for a greater focus on organizations in im-
plementation science [22]. Yano [22] suggested that
implementation researchers could leverage organizational
theory to identify organization-level implementation deter-
minants; however, Yano ’s primary objective was to advo-
cate for the use of organization-level implementation
determinants —not organizational theory —in implementa-
tion research. With a few notable exceptions [23 –27], the
application of organizational theory in implementation re-
search remains limited. To date, organizational theory re-
mains unfamiliar to many implementation researchers,
and guidance for applying organizational theory in imple-
mentation research is lacking. To advance rigorous andtheoretically grounded studies of the influence of outer
context on implementation, in this paper, we discuss how
four organizational theories apply to implementation
research.
In the “Discussion ”section, we illustrate the use of four
organizational theories (transaction cost economics, re-
source dependency theory, institutional theory, and con-
tingency theories) that we found to be particularly apt for
retrospectively explaining how and why interactions be-
tween organizations and their external environments in-
fluenced the implementation of SafeCare, a program for
preventing child maltreatment. In the “Summary ”section,
we describe how organizational theories can be used pro-
spectively, to inform development and empirical tests of,
for example, policy and financing strategies.
Discussion
SafeCare®
SafeCare® is an evidence-based behavioral parent training
model that targets the proximal parenting behaviors that
lead to the abuse and neglect of children with at-risk (typ-
ically involved in child welfare or intensive prevention set-
tings) parents of children 0 to 5 years old [28]. Using a
structured, behavioral approach, trained SafeCare pro-
viders deliver in-home parent training in three core con-
tent areas: home safety, child health, and parent-child
interactions. The program originated in 1979 in a child
welfare system in rural southern Illinois as Project 12-
Ways, which trained parents in up to 12 skill-sets [29]. Be-
cause of its many components, Project 12-Ways was not
easily disseminated, and thus, it was not feasible to take
the program to scale. Accordingly, the program was con-
densed to three skill-sets and renamed SafeCare. SafeCare
is typically delivered in 18 weekly sessions (6 sessions per
module), with sessions averaging 1 hour.
SafeCare in its current form has been implemented in
23 US states —6 of which executed statewide or large re-
gional rollouts —and 6 other countries (Belarus, Spain,
Israel, England, Australia, and Canada). SafeCare has been
implemented in a variety of service settings, including
child welfare, prevention, judicial, and early childhood
education. Within US child welfare settings, interventions
may be implemented by public child welfare agencies
(state- or county-level authorities responsible for child
safety, permanency, and well-being), by private child wel-
fare organizations (local private community-based organi-
zations (CBOs) contracted by public child welfare
agencies to deliver an array of services to children and
families), or throughout the entire state or county child
welfare system (which includes the public agency and its
network of private organizations) [30, 31]. The complex
organizational relationships inherent to this public-private
child welfare system provide an ideal context for applying
organizational theories to understand the influence of theBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 2 of 15
external environment in the implementation of SafeCare.
The model has been evaluated with various research de-
signs, including single-case studies, quasi-experimental
studies, and randomized trials [32]. The largest random-
ized trial was a statewide trial in the Oklahoma child wel-
fare system that compared SafeCare to home-based
services that did not include SafeCare [33]. The findings
indicated that SafeCare significantly reduced child welfare
recidivism [33], findings which were consistent across ra-
cial and ethnic groups, including a subsample ( N=3 5 4 )o f
American Indians [34]. Finally, other research has demon-
strated that SafeCare positively impacts parent engage-
ment and retention in voluntary prevention services [35],
parent satisfaction, perceived cultural competency of the
program [33], and caseworker retention [36] compared to
service as usual in child welfare and prevention systems.
The National SafeCare Training and Research Center
(NSTRC) provides a variety of supports to implementing
agencies to train providers to deliver SafeCare with fidel-
ity. Providers are typically either bachelor ’s- or master ’s-
degreed professionals and are employed by an agency that
contracts with state or county government to deliver child
welfare or prevention services. In some cases, the pro-
viders of SafeCare are county or state employees, as states
have different models for providing services to families, al-
though the trend is largely toward private CBOs. All agen-
cies that contract with the NSTRC for SafeCare training
and implementation support begin the partnership with
implementation planning discussions about resources, eli-
gible client populations, and general readiness. Once a
contract is established for training, NSTRC faculty and
staff conduct a general readiness process, which includes
an on-site orientation for trainees, leadership, and relevant
community partners (e.g., referring agencies, funders) to
finalize the implementation and training plan. Subse-
quently, SafeCare providers attend a 4-day training on de-
livering the SafeCare model to families. Once they begin
to implement SafeCare, providers receive coaching by
NSTRC trainers. Coaching consists of fidelity observations
(primarily through audio recordings), followed by coach-
ing sessions to discuss positive and corrective feedback
from a SafeCare coach. The frequency of coaching is
front-loaded with sessions occurring weekly until the pro-
vider is certified (i.e., has demonstrated fidelity in three
sessions in each of the three modules) and then is con-
ducted monthly [37]. Implementation support also in-
cludes ongoing team and administrative meetings to
ensure fidelity, address implementation challenges, and
optimize sustainment.
Despite demonstrated effectiveness and available imple-
mentation supports, challenges have been documented re-
lated to SafeCare adoption [10] (the decision to use
SafeCare), implementation [38] (the complex process
whereby SafeCare use becomes increasingly proficient andconsistent among organizational members), and sustain-
ment [39–41] (a state in which SafeCare use persists over
several years without SafeCare developers ’assistance). In
the sections that follow, we describe challenges associated
with these three stages of SafeCare life cycle (adoption,
implementation, and sustainment). The SafeCare studies
that we cite in this paper were conducted by established
implementation and intervention scholars, including those
who have expertise in organizational theory and behavior.
However, their studies were designed to focus on features
and processes within internal organizational environments
(e.g., community development teams, leadership). Thus,
organizational theories fell outside the scope of the stud-
ies. In collaboration with SafeCare experts (DJW, SRS,
WLR, JRSC), we propose in this paper that organizational
theories can be leveraged to retrospectively explain how
relationships between organizations and their external en-
vironments contributed to their success adopting, imple-
menting, and sustaining SafeCare. Table 1 summarizes the
main propositions of the four organizational theories that
we feature in the paper and their application to SafeCare.
(Note that the organizational theories featured in this
paper are significantly more complex than we are able to
include in the table or the descriptions that follow.) In the
“Summary ”section, we argue that these organizational
theories offer unique insights into adoption, implementa-
tion, and sustainment that could advance implementation
research prospectively .
Adoption
Adoption refers to an individual or organizational decision
to begin using an innovation. In the USA, child welfare
systems encounter pressure from policymakers and fun-
ders to address problems with child abuse and neglect. In-
creasingly, child welfare systems are encouraged to adopt
and implement evidence-based interventions (EBIs), such
as SafeCare, to improve child safety, permanency, and
well-being. Recent trends are for state and county public
welfare agencies to privatize services by contracting with
private CBOs to deliver EBIs, including SafeCare, rather
than adopting the models for use “in-house ”[31]. Trans-
action cost economics theory and institutional theory, two
widely used organizational theories, are particularly apt
for explaining (1) why public child welfare agencies in-
creasingly contract with CBOs to administer EBIs to pre-
vent child abuse and neglect, and (2) why the EBI of
choice was often SafeCare.
Why did public child welfare agencies contract with CBOs
to administer EBIs to prevent child abuse and neglect? A
transaction cost economics explanation
Ostensibly, public child welfare agencies had the option of
acting as direct service providers, hiring staff to administer
SafeCare. Instead, many public child welfare agenciesBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 3 of 15
contract with CBOs to administer SafeCare [31]. To im-
prove efficiency, responsiveness, and flexibility in the ser-
vices provided, many child welfare agencies in the USA
have become increasingly privatized by increasing con-
tracting with private CBOs to deliver core child welfare
services, such as maltreatment prevention [31, 42, 43].
Transaction cost economics (TCE) theory explains how
public child welfare agencies ’decisions to adopt SafeCare
may be influenced by their ability to “buy”SafeCare by
contracting with CBOs instead of “making ”SafeCare (i.e.,
administering it in-house), diminishing the cost of admin-
istering SafeCare. TCE suggests that costs are driven by
the transactions required to accomplish tasks. TCE states
that three factors influence the cost of a transaction and,
in turn, the “make ”vs.“buy”decision: (1) frequency of the
transaction, (2) uncertainty of the transaction, and (3)
asset specificity required for the transaction [44].Transaction frequency refers to how often parties engage
in a transaction; increased transaction frequency increases
transaction costs. For example, as described in detail
below, changes in the procurement process used by public
child welfare agencies increased the frequency with which
they had to communicate with CBOs to contract for Safe-
Care, thus increasing the cost of contracting with CBOs
for SafeCare. Uncertainty refers to information regarding
the transaction that is unclear or unknown, thus increas-
ing transaction costs. This would be the case if child wel-
fare agencies had little information regarding SafeCare,
increasing the cost of adoption. Asset specificity refers to
how specialized resources must be for the transaction to
transpire; increased asset specificity increases transaction
costs. For example, staff who are specially trained in Safe-
Care represent a highly specialized and potentially non-
transferrable asset, thus increasing the cost associatedTable 1 Organizational theory descriptions and applications to SafeCare
Theory Main propositions Applications to SafeCare
Transaction cost economics Transaction costs influence whether an organization
decides to contract with another organization to
implement an EBI.
Decreases in transaction frequency will increase the
likelihood that organizations will contract with other
organizations to implement an EBI.
Past relationships between organizations reduce the
uncertainty and costs associated with contracting.Adoption:
Child welfare systems ’decision to contract with CBOs to
administer EBIs rather than acting as direct EBI providers
internally was likely influenced by costs.
The cost of EBI administration is driven by the frequency
of collaboration between CBOs and child welfare systems
and the familiarity of child welfare systems with CBOs.
Institutional theory Organizations implement EBIs that are viewed as
legitimate by institutions within their environment.
Organizations adopt certain EBIs in response to coercion
or strong pressures to comply with rules, mandates, and
regulations.
Organizations mimic the behaviors and structures of
other successful organizations such as adoption of certain
EBIs.
Organizations will adopt EBIs that align with professional
norms.Adoption:
Child welfare systems ’decision to adopt SafeCare was
likely influenced by pressure from policymakers to provide
EBIs, perceptions that SafeCare was viewed as a norm, and
advocacy from child welfare professional communities for
use of SafeCare.
Sustainment:
Efforts to maintain SafeCare contracts may have coerced
CBOs to sustain SafeCare by establishing rules, regulations,
and mandates set forth in contracts.
The contracts garnered support for SafeCare, creating
normative pressure on CBOs to sustain SafeCare.
Contingency theories Organizations ’design decisions are contingent upon the
organization ’s internal and external contexts.
Successful EBI implementation is influenced by whether
the EBI fits with an organization ’s internal context.
Organizations ’ability to adapt to their external context
influences successful EBI implementation.Implementation:
The use of ICTs allowed child welfare systems to respond
to external contexts such as local client needs.
Internal context influenced implementation as larger,
governmental organizations had less flexibility in how
SafeCare could be implemented.
Resource dependency
theoryOrganizations ’design decisions are informed by their
dependence on other organizations, ability to maintain
autonomy, and relationships with other organizations.
Organizations form relationships with other
organizations to acquire and maintain resources and
autonomy.Implementation:
CBOs depended on the organizations that funded them
and SafeCare developers (for expertise), which lessened
their autonomy and power.
CBOs often negotiated the balance of autonomy and
dependence on other organizations by establishing
relationships via ICTs, which minimized the resources
individual CBOs needed to implement SafeCare.
Sustainment:
Policymakers could have earmarked funds for contracts
that would have supported SafeCare to obtain sufficient
resources for SafeCare sustainment.
Train-the-trainer models decreased CBOs ’dependence on
SafeCare developers so that their staff could autonomously
sustain the practice without.

with adopting SafeCare. Public agencies might be more
likely to contract with CBOs to deliver SafeCare when that
partnership is expected to yield fewer costs than “making ”
the service in-house. For instance, in the case of SafeCare,
adopting agencies would need to invest in specialized
training, materials, and fidelity monitoring to administer
SafeCare in-house. In addition, an agency might need to
hire new staff or divert existing staff away from other du-
ties for SafeCare training and service delivery. The cost of
investing in these assets that are highly specific to Safe-
Care and might not transfer to other areas of agency func-
tioning may make agencies more likely to contract with
CBOs to deliver SafeCare than “making ”the service in-
house. Although contracting for services can also be costly
(e.g., in terms of costs associated with the search for a
CBO to contract with for SafeCare implementation and
contract management), contracting could be less expen-
sive and offer more flexibility to agencies than administer-
ing SafeCare in-house, facilitating SafeCare adoption.
Thus, many child welfare agencies contract with CBOs to
deliver services.
TCE may explain the stagnation in EBI adoption [45]:
if the costs of administering SafeCare in-house and con-
tracting with CBOs to do so are both too high, public
child welfare agencies may have opted out of adopting
SafeCare altogether. Indeed, as Willging et al. [10] docu-
mented, changes in the procurement process used by
public child welfare agencies increased the transaction
costs associated with contracting with CBOs for Safe-
Care, potentially deterring them from adopting SafeCare
altogether. In the traditional contract bidding system,
public child welfare agencies were not blinded to bidding
CBOs. In fact, public child welfare agencies had estab-
lished relationships with CBOs characterized by rela-
tively infrequent negotiations and certainty around the
feasibility of the CBO administering a high-quality EBI.
Specifically, some CBOs with which public child welfare
agencies had historically contracted engaged in inter-
agency collaborations to support the administration of
SafeCare, an EBI with which CBOs had substantial and
increasing familiarity. These collaborations decreased
CBOs ’costs of administering the EBI. Taken together,
the traditional contract bidding system minimized the
frequency of transactions between public child welfare
agencies and CBOs, and it minimized the uncertainty of
the transactions for EBI contracts. In contrast, a new
procurement system, Best Value-Performance Informa-
tion Procurement System (BV-PIPS), introduced a blind
bidding process that produced substantial uncertainty
around contracting. This process increased the fre-
quency of transactions between child welfare systems
and CBOs due to lack of familiarity, making the cost of
contracting with CBOs to administer an EBI greater
than the traditional contract bidding system.Institutional theory explains why SafeCare was often the EBI
selected to prevent child abuse and neglect among CBOs
Institutional theory suggests that organizations, including
the public and private agencies that constitute child wel-
fare systems, are motivated to align their structures and
behaviors with the values, norms, and expectations es-
poused by institutions in their environments (e.g., govern-
ment, client groups, accrediting bodies), as opposed to
being primarily motivated by demonstrating superior out-
comes or performance, to maintain legitimacy [46, 47]. In-
stitutional theory posits that organizational changes, such
as the adoption of SafeCare, are a consequence of three
types of institutional pressures: coercive, mimetic, and
normative isomorphism. Organizations change as an
adaptive response to coercion, or strong pressures to com-
ply with rules, regulations, and mandates. For example, or-
ganizations adopt new forms, technologies, or behaviors
to adhere to mandates from government agencies [48, 49].
This was likely the case for child welfare systems. Policy-
makers, including state and county administrators in child
welfare agencies, demand solutions to problems with child
abuse and neglect; in Oklahoma, for example, policy-
makers specifically advocated for the use of SafeCare,
making it the most politically viable mechanism for child
welfare systems to prevent child abuse and neglect [50].
Further, federal and state legislators increasingly require
public child welfare agencies or their contractors to use
EBIs. In the USA, Washington state legislature passed sev-
eral bills encouraging the use of EBIs [51, 52], and at the
federal level, the 2016 Families First Prevention Services
Act (HR5456; not enacted) [53] would have restricted
funding to evidence-based child welfare interventions
only. These efforts represent coercion to adopt SafeCare
and the handful of other evidence-based child welfare
interventions.
It is also likely that SafeCare was often the EBI of choice
to prevent child abuse and neglect because implementing
EBIs is increasingly viewed as a norm among child welfare
systems [53], despite persistent confusion regarding EBIs
and how to effectively implement them. Institutional the-
ory posits that, to gain legitimacy and resources, organiza-
tions mimic the behaviors or structures of other
successful organizations [54], especially under conditions
of uncertainty or goal ambiguity. Policymakers in
Oklahoma reported that they supported SafeCare imple-
mentation because they viewed its designation as an
EBI—a designation that was upheld by peer organizations
as legitimate —as assurance that it might produce favor-
able outcomes [50]. Further, among the contracted CBOs,
some engaged in interagency collaborative teams (ICTs)
to administer SafeCare [55]; among these ICTs, SafeCare
may have been viewed as the normative EBI for preventing
child abuse and neglect, representing additional normative
pressure from CBOs.Birken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 5 of 15
Institutional theory also posits that organizations adapt
and align with strong professional norms, values, and ex-
pectations conveyed via formal education, training, licens-
ing, and accrediting bodies. Few child welfare professionals
likely undergo formal training i n child welfare interventions
prior to entering the workforce because they tend to come
from disciplines outside of social work [56]; however, nor-
mative pressures are likely salient for the child welfare sys-
tems targeted for SafeCare given that they rely on workers
who are professionalized and therefore subject to influence
from professional organizations and normative pressures of
the field. Hurlburt et al. found that leadership within child
welfare systems ’professional communities, including direc-
tors of community-based provider organizations and local
foundations, advocated for the use of SafeCare [57].
Organizational theories ’contribution to understanding
SafeCare ’s adoption
The conclusions that authors have drawn regarding
SafeCare ’s adoption may be enhanced by drawing on
TCE and institutional theory. For example, Willging et
al. concluded that a substantial barrier to SafeCare adop-
tion was the costs of training, materials, fidelity monitor-
ing, and clinicians ’time away from their clinical duties
[50]. Viewed through the lens of TCE, these discrete var-
iables are examples of a host of potential determinants
of adoption. Training, materials, etc. represent costs as-
sociated with a broader transaction required to adminis-
ter SafeCare. Public child welfare agencies minimize and
address such cost-related barriers to adoption by con-
tracting with private CBOs to deliver EBIs like SafeCare.
These barriers are minimized insofar as the transaction
costs associated with contracting are also minimal. Espe-
cially within human services, these contracting relation-
ships are based on familiarity and trust, which serves as
a safeguard for both the public child welfare agency and
the private CBOs, reducing the risk (and costs) associ-
ated with the contract, thus promoting adoption of the
EBI. BV-PIPS, a blind process, exacerbated uncertainty
and risks for both the public agency and private CBOs,
heightening transaction costs, thus disrupting SafeCare ’s
adoption. In this sense, TCE explains how BV-PIPS dis-
rupted SafeCare ’s adoption by increasing the contracting
costs.
Institutional theory offers another explanation for why
BV-PIPS had the capacity to disrupt SafeCare ’s adoption
among the private CBOs. Traditionally, the default EBI
for public child welfare agencies and CBOs was Safe-
Care, due to support in the form of coercive pressure
from policymakers, mimetic pressure in the form of per-
vasive ICTs around SafeCare, and normative pressure in
the form of general professional acceptance of SafeCare
as a viable approach to preventing child abuse and neg-
lect. In contrast, BV-PIPS allowed bidders greater choiceof EBIs. In fact, Willging et al. found that many CBOs
bidding under BV-PIPS did not propose to use SafeCare
[10], and many proposed using interventions that were
not evidence-based; this may speak to the limits of insti-
tutional pressure to adopt EBIs in the face of the more
substantial transaction costs associated with contracting
under BV-PIPS.
Implementation
Implementation refers to the complex process whereby
targeted organizational members ’use of an innovation
such as SafeCare becomes increasingly proficient and con-
sistent. Child welfare systems that adopted SafeCare faced
conditions that may have limited the proficiency and
consistency of SafeCare use. Specifically, the CBOs
contracted to administer SafeCare exhibited unique local
needs including varying cultures and client demographics.
CBOs also had limited time, staff, funding, and other re-
sources available to implement SafeCare. To address these
potential barriers to implementation, some CBOs engaged
in ICTs. ICTs were formed with an explicit goal of devel-
oping locally based SafeCare trainers. The SafeCare devel-
opers (NSTRC) trained an initial group of 12 staff from
several different local organizations; those staff members
were trained to a high degree of expertise, and eventually,
the best performers were trained as SafeCare trainers.
Subsequently, the local SafeCare trainers trained other
members of other organizations and conducted coaching
and implementation support [55]. The following sections
will apply two additional organizational theories —contin-
gency theories and resource dependency theory
(RDT) —to explain how ICTs addressed local CBO needs
and minimized CBOs ’resource constraints, thereby facili-
tating SafeCare implementation.
How did ICTs address local CBO needs, thereby facilitating
SafeCare implementation? A contingency theories
perspective
ICTs ’ability to address local CBO needs, thereby facilitating
SafeCare implementation, may be explained using contin-
gency theories. Contingency theories are a class of behav-
ioral theories that state, in essence, that optimal structure
and leadership is contingent upon an organization ’si n t e r n a l
and external contexts: An organization that is effective and
efficient under some conditions may not be successful in
others [58, 59]. One of implementation science ’sp r e m i s e s
is analogous to the premise of contingency theories: context
has critical implications for implementation. As such, con-
tingency theories offer a well- established framework for
conceptualizing the centrality of context, which implemen-
tation science deems of utmost importance.
Contingency theories suggest that best practices are con-
tingent upon an organization ’s internal and external con-
texts. Internal context is defined by factors that influenceBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 6 of 15
work activities from within an organization. Organizations
that implemented SafeCare represented a diverse array of
internal contexts, ranging from those found in government
bureaucracies to foundations to small non-profits. Internal
context affected stakeholders ’ability to make the changes
necessary to implement SafeCare. For example, one CBO
attempting to implement SafeCare was part of a large
county health and human services agency. The agency ’s
multiple layers of bureaucracy limited the organization ’s
flexibility to take advantage of o pportunities that might have
facilitated SafeCare implementation. As described above, in-
ternal context also factored into the fit between SafeCare
and CBOs ’existing processes; implementation was facili-
tated to the extent that SafeCare fit with an organization ’s
internal context [2] (e.g., was able to be integrated into a
CBO ’s electronic referral system; did not compete with
existing programs). Contingency theories suggest that ICTs
may have decreased uncertainty associated with resource
constraints, thereby facilitating SafeCare implementation.
External context is defined by factors that exist outside
and are not under the control of the organization, but
which influence the organization ’s structure and develop-
ment. In some settings, ICTs allowed for tailoring SafeCare
to the external context in which implementing organiza-
tions existed. For instance, among Latino populations in
Southern California, ICTs implementing SafeCare were
flexible enough to ensure fidelity to core SafeCare modules
while translating SafeCare into Spanish and addressing
other fundamental cultural diff erences (e.g., addition of in-
formation regarding home remedies that are common
among Latino subcultures). In socially disadvantaged set-
tings, ICTs also facilitated the tailoring of SafeCare to CBOs
serving clients whose basic need s (e.g., food, shelter) super-
seded the needs that SafeCare addresses; in these settings,
ICTs allowed the CBOs ’providers to prioritize meeting cli-
ents’basic needs before initiating SafeCare [60].
Drawing on RDT to understand how CBOs ’external
relationships facilitated SafeCare implementation
CBOs that implemented SafeCare depend on critical fi-
nancial and human resources to support full implementa-
tion of the model. In particular, CBOs depended on the
public child welfare agencies (and, in turn, counties and
states) for the majority of financing to implement and de-
liver SafeCare. However, financing might have been low
due, in part, to CBOs ’incentive to submit bids that are
low enough to compete with the many other bids submit-
ted. Also, not every CBO that bid on the contract was go-
ing to receive an award, heightening competition, and
financial uncertainty for the CBOs that depended on these
contracts. To buffer against the limited resources, and im-
prove the chances that they would secure and maintain
the contract, a small group of CBOs that were competing
for the same bid collaborated with one another. Throughthis collaboration, the CBOs agreed that whichever orga-
nizations won the bid would pool the financial and other
resources with the rest of the small group. Thus, the risk
and rewards were shared among collaborative group
members, and by doing so, additional CBOs implemented
SafeCare beyond those that were contracted to do so.
Thus, this collaborative agreement among CBOs helped
to minimize resource constraints, and facilitated SafeCare
implementation. However, although these CBOs imple-
mented SafeCare, this collaborative arrangement came at
the expense of the autonomy CBOs required to maintain
relevance to local needs [2].
The emergence of this collaborative arrangement,
which facilitated SafeCare implementation can be ex-
plained by RDT. Given the criticality of resources
for organizational functioning, RDT suggests that the
availability and access to resources (located in the
external organizational environment) influences
organizational behavior. Thus, organizational leaders
make decisions to balance three competing needs:
(1) dependence on others for resources, (2) mainten-
ance of autonomy, and (3) the establishment of rela-
tionships [61]. Specifically, organizations develop
partnerships, alliances, and other types of relation-
ships to secure needed resources [62, 63]. However,
these relationships create dependence —for instance,
heavy fiscal dependence among private CBOs on the
public child welfare agency —which can lead to a
lack of certainty, predict ability, and power among
the local organizations especially amidst fluctuations
in funding and procurement/allocation processes.
To counteract the consequences of dependence, or-
ganizations seek autonomy by attempting to control
resources and environments [64]. Organizations exert
control of their environment by placing their mem-
bers on a board of directors, forming joint ventures
or merging with or acquiring another organization,
joining action sets of groups of organizations who
m a k eac o l l e c t i v er e s p o n s et oe x t e r n a lc o n s t r a i n t s ,o r
engaging in other types of collaborative relationships.
In the case of SafeCare, the interdependence associ-
ated with collaborative partnerships among CBOs
(ICTs) may have been offset by the control that they
gained over the financial resources available, their de-
creased dependence on the public child welfare
agency, and reduced risks associated with the finan-
cial insecurity imposed by the new contracting proce-
dures. Organizations that maintain autonomy are well
positioned to influence their environments and main-
tain control over resources [61]. In fact, these admin-
istrative collaborations among competing CBOs,
especially among those with a long history of trust
and working together, are a strategy for adapting to
or pushing back against competition [65, 66].Birken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 7 of 15
Organizational theories ’contribution to understanding
SafeCare ’s implementation
Viewed through the lens of contingency theories and
RDT, the conclusions about SafeCare ’s implementation
may be enhanced and synthesized across studies. Safe-
Care researchers noted how their implementation study
findings may have had limited generalizability to diverse
contexts because some CBOs prioritized interventions
that addressed client crises over using SafeCare [1] or
used ICTs [57] to address local needs shaped by unique
client demographics (i.e., American Indians in Oklahoma
vs. Latinos in Southern California) [34], and competing
child welfare programs [67]. Instead of conceptualizing
these unique characteristics of diverse study contexts as
limiting generalizability, contingency theories and RDT
reframe these study “limitations ”as strategic responses
that align organizations with the external context. In the
case of SafeCare, the use and effectiveness of ICTs for
addressing barriers to implementation is explained by
contingency theories, which suggest that active efforts
are needed to address potential barriers to implementa-
tion due to idiosyncrasies associated with organizations ’
internal and external contexts. The importance of inter-
agency relationships for securing stable resources for im-
plementation is explained by RDT, which suggests that
interagency relationships, facilitated by trust, memo-
randa of understanding, and negotiations, were critical
for CBOs attempting to balance dependence on funding
agencies and SafeCare developers [57] with the auton-
omy they need to best implement SafeCare.
Linking SafeCare study results to organizational theory
would allow authors to more explicitly contribute to
generalizable knowledge regarding SafeCare implementa-
tion and, more broadly, to other EBIs. In essence, ICT was
one approach to tailoring SafeCare to the local context
and maintaining the autonomy needed to implement Safe-
Care in a way that was locally relevant in the face of de-
pendence on funding agencies and SafeCare developers.
In this way, findings regarding SafeCare ’s implementation
can be extrapolated to the implementation of any number
of EBIs in any number of organizational contexts.
Sustainment
Sustainment refers to the continuous use of an
innovation, as intended, over time [40, 41]. In a study of
11 sites that implemented SafeCare, Willging et al. [50]
found three levels of sustainment: (1) full sustainment (7
sites), with certified providers maintaining active Safe-
Care caseloads and regularly convened SafeCare teams
(range of years sustained: 2 –10); (2) partial sustainment
(1 site), where certified providers used SafeCare in their
active caseloads but did not regularly meet in SafeCare
teams (years sustained: 4); and (3) not sustained (3 sites),
where certified providers did not use SafeCare at thetime of the study (range of years sustained: 1.5 –2.3). In-
stitutional theory and resource dependency theory help
to explain variation in SafeCare sustainment across sites.
Willging et al. found that SafeCare sustainment was lim-
ited, in part, by policymakers who invested insufficient ef-
fort to develop the contracts necessary to sustain SafeCare
[50]. Efforts to develop and maintain contracts have two
functions. The first function can be explained with institu-
tional theory : Efforts to maintain SafeCare contracts may
have coerced CBOs to sustain SafeCare by establishing
rules, regulations, and mandates set forth in contracts.
The contracts also garnered support for SafeCare, creating
normative pressure on CBOs to sustain SafeCare; in sites
where SafeCare was not the assumed approach to prevent-
ing child abuse and neglect among child welfare social
workers responsible for submitting referrals, SafeCare was
not sustained. The second function can be explained with
RDT: In essence, contracts confer the resources, including
organizational relationships, needed for SafeCare sustain-
ment. Indeed, policymakers could earmark funds for con-
tracts that would support SafeCare and partner with
collaborators to obtain sufficient resources for SafeCare
sustainment [50].
Outside of contracts, Willging et al. also identified the
train-the-trainer model associated with SafeCare as influ-
ential in its sustainment [50]. The benefits of the train-
the-trainer model to SafeCare ’ss u s t a i n m e n tc a nb e
explained with RDT: The train-the-trainer model de-
creased CBOs ’dependence on SafeCare developers so that
their staff could more autonomously sustain the practice,
relying on and paying NSTRC less to sustain SafeCare.
Organizational theories ’contribution to understanding
SafeCare ’s sustainment
The conclusions that authors have drawn regarding Safe-
Care ’s sustainment may be enhanced using the lens of the
organizational theories described above. Authors have iden-
tified several specific determinants of SafeCare sustainment
including the presence of champions, advocacy from pol-
icymakers, and relationships forged by policymakers. The
mechanisms underlying these determinants can be ex-
plained with organizational the ories, promoting their rele-
vance for other EBIs; inst ead of encouraging future
research to identify “strategies to promote congruence of
leadership, mission and vision ”[50], organizational theories
suggest constructs that under lie the variables that authors
have proposed as determinants of sustainment. Specifically,
institutional theory suggests that organizations can harness
coercive pressure (e.g., Oklahoma policymakers ’advocacy
for SafeCare), mimetic pressure (e.g., champions for Safe-
Care), and normative pressure to sustain EBI use. RDT sug-
gests that the relationships forged by policymakers that
promoted SafeCare sustainment were a manifestation of or-
ganizations ’balance of dependence and autonomy toBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 8 of 15
control the resources necessary for SafeCare use. In this
sense, organizational theories are able to generalize deter-
minants specific to a particular intervention (e.g., SafeCare)
in a particular setting (e.g., Oklahoma), promoting the
ability to predict determinants of sustainment in other
contexts.
Summary
This paper has demonstrated the application of four
well-known organizational theories to retrospectively ex-
plain the implementation of SafeCare. More generally,
this paper demonstrates the utility of organizational the-
ory for explaining the influence of the complex inter-
action between organizations and their environment on
implementation. Such explanations are largely lacking in
extant implementation studies. There are a few notable
exceptions. For example, studies have found institutional
theory useful for explaining how an organization ’s exter-
nal environment influences the integration of evidence
into practice [23] and which intervention components
are most likely to be sustained [24]. TCE has been used
to explain how organizational networks form [25] and
why organizations engaged in pay-for-performance may
“game ”the system, inflating performance scores to
maximize payment [26]. Shortell used institutional the-
ory and TCE theory to understand the development and
evaluation of accountable care organizations [27]. Invok-
ing organizational theory more frequently to explain the
influence of organizations ’interactions with their envir-
onment on implementation has the potential to advance
knowledge in the field. For example, if transaction costs
are found to influence organizations ’approaches to im-
plementation, then implementation research and strat-
egies can be designed to account for transaction costs.
Prospective application of organizational theory to
implementation research
Although most of this paper has addressed retrospective
applications of organizational theory, organizational theor-
ies may also be used prospectively in implementation re-
search. Table 2 displays applications of TCE, institutional
theory, contingency theories, and RDT, as well as examples
of hypothetical applications of these theories to SafeCare.
Broadly, TCE helps to anticipate whether innovations
will be implemented in-house or if implementation will
be outsourced, which is especially applicable for studying
implementation of EBIs within the public sector, since
public agencies are encouraged to outsource services to
private contractors. TCE suggests that implementation
strategies should seek to minimize transaction costs. For
example, TCE suggests that electronic handoffs of pa-
tient information among providers, such as the trans-
mission of survivorship care plans among providers via
electronic health records, will promote implementation[68]. TCE may also be helpful for informing how public
agencies and other service funders design their procure-
ment processes and contracts for EBIs.
Institutional theory suggests that an organization will
implement an innovation when it is in congruence with
the values, norms, and expectations espoused by institu-
tions in an organization ’s environment. Implementation
strategies should either seek to influence the values,
norms, and expectations of institutions within an organi-
zation ’s environment or adapt the innovation to con-
verge with institutional values, norms, and expectations
to the extent possible with minimal compromise of fidel-
ity to the intent of the innovation. This may involve, for
example, framing an innovation using language that is
likely to be perceived as aligned with institutions ’values,
norms, and expectations.
Contingency theories suggest that implementation opti-
mally involves adaptation to organizations ’internal con-
texts (e.g., organizational capacity, mission and values,
culture) and external contexts (e.g., patient needs, political
environment, geographic locations) and to changes in
those contexts over time. This suggests that innovations
should be developed with a dynamic approach to imple-
mentation in mind. A common elements approach to im-
plementation would potentially be most successful:
implementing common techniques across EBI models
would allow clinicians greater flexibility to meet diverse
client needs and organizations more flexibility in training
their workers [69, 70]. To optimize intervention delivery,
scholars have advocated for efforts to systematically adapt
interventions to the varied and unique contexts in which
they are disseminated [71]. Evidence regarding successful
adaptation of promising interventions to a variety of set-
tings continues to accumulate. For example, a diabetes
care quality improvement initiative was originally success-
fully launched in an insured (health maintenance
organization) setting and later adapted to meet the needs
of federally qualified health centers [72].
RDT suggests that organizations will weigh the re-
sources to be gained against the autonomy to be lost from
innovation implementation. To the extent that organiza-
tions can use strategies to tip the balance in their favor,
implementation may be more successful. This is the con-
tention of the “systems ”thinking/change perspective [73],
which asserts that successful implementation is a function
of the control key stakeholders have over resources. Em-
pirical evidence supports this hypothesis. For example, au-
tonomy was found to be a key determinant of the
implementation of an intervention to promote effective
pain management in older people [74].
Our paper has several limitations. First, the organizational
theories that we have described in this paper themselves
have limitations. Perrow critiqued TCE ’s neglect of power
relations. Indeed, in some cases, organizational theories ’Birken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 9 of 15
propositions sometimes contradict each other [75]. For ex-
ample, TCE may predict that an organization will fail to
adopt an EBI due to excessive transaction costs, whereas in-
stitutional theory may predict that the organization will
adopt the EBI to gain legitimacy, despite high transaction
costs. Underlying these differences is divergence in the the-
ories ’paradigms. TCE, contingency theories, and RDT ’sp a r -
adigms are rooted in economics, which values rationality to
explain organizational outcomes. In contrast, institutional
theory takes a more sociological view and emphasizes the
role of social forces, relationships, and norms in explaining
organizational outcomes. Also, in contrast to frameworks,
which are often intended to be comprehensive of determi-
nants of implementation, theories tend to focus on a limited
group of constructs about which specific causal relation-
ships are proposed [76]. Further, in this paper, we have
applied organizational theories to understanding macro-
organizational relationships (i.e., relationships between orga-
nizations and their external environments). These theories
may also be useful for understanding micro-organizational
relationships, i.e., how factors within organizations (e.g., cul-
ture, climate, leadership) influ ence implementation. Theor-
ies in the field of organizational behavior may also be useful
for understanding micro-organizational relationships. As an
example, researchers have extended theories about
organizational citizenship behavior to implementation sci-
ence by developing an implemen tation citizenship behaviorscale, which assesses employee behaviors that go beyond
what is required to implement EBIs. Additionally, Aarons
and colleagues have used leadership and strategic climate
theories to derive an implementation leadership scale,
allowing researchers to examine the impact of strategic
leadership on organizational context for implementation.
Health psychologists have increasingly applied behavior
change theories to explain the behavior of individuals in-
cluding providers and patients. For example, Karvinen et al.
used the theory of planned behavior to understand exercise
among endometrial cancer survivors [77]. Research that at-
tempts to demonstrate causal relationships between deter-
minants at multiple levels of the ecological framework and
implementation may benefit from applying theories in sev-
eral of these fields.
Second, in this paper, we have presented four
organizational theories that may be useful in implementa-
t i o nr e s e a r c hb e c a u s et h e yw e r ep a r t i c u l a r l ya p tf o re x p l a i n -
ing SafeCare ’s adoption, implementation, and sustainment.
Other organizational theories that may be useful in imple-
mentation research include pop ulation ecology of organiza-
tions, agency theory, and exchange theory. For example,
population ecology suggests that an organization ’s adaptive
need for reliability and accountability to survive predisposes
it to inertia and resistance to the change required to imple-
ment innovations [78]. Principal-agent and stewardship
theories might be useful for investigating the influence ofTable 2 Prospective application of organizational theory to SafeCare©
Organizational theories Prospective application Hypothetical prospective application to SafeCare
Transaction cost economics —explains how
organizations decide whether to “make ”a good
or service internally or “buy”(i.e., acquire
externally) a needed good or service.Implementation may be outsourced if doing so
is more efficient than implementing in-house.
Implementation strategies should be selected to
minimize transaction costs, which are positively
associated with transaction frequency and un-
certainty and asset specificity and likely nega-
tively associated with implementation.Bidding processes that minimize the frequency
and uncertainty of the transactions required for
SafeCare contracting will promote
implementation by allowing organizations to
commit resources to implementation instead of
transaction costs.
Institutional theory —explains how organizations
are motivated to align their structures and
behaviors with the values, norms, and
expectations espoused by institutions in their
environments (e.g., government, client groups,
accrediting bodies), as opposed to being
primarily motivated by demonstrating superior
outcomes or performance, to maintain
legitimacy.Implementation is likely to be influenced by
coercive, normative, mimetic pressures from
institutions within an organization ’s
environment. Implementation strategies should
seek congruence with the values, norms, and
expectations of relevant institutions in the
implementing organization ’s environment.Staying attuned to the priorities of institutions in
organizations ’environments will promote
SafeCare implementation directly (e.g.,
institutions advocating for SafeCare
implementation) and indirectly (e.g.,
organizations perceive institutions as approving
of SafeCare implementation).
Contingency theories —explain how
organizations ’actions are contingent upon an
organization ’s internal and external contexts,
which influence the organizations ’structure and
development.Organizations ’structure is a critical determinant
of implementation, and organizations ’structure
continuously changes in response to dynamic
internal and external contexts. Implementation
strategies should be regularly revisited to
address organizations ’dynamic internal and
external contexts.Designing SafeCare explicitly for adaptation will
promote implementation by allowing
organizations to accommodate their unique and
dynamic internal and external contexts.
Resource dependency theory —explains how
organizations structure themselves and
associate with each other in order to acquire
and maintain autonomy and the resources
necessary to survive.Implementation will be impeded to the extent
that it limits organizations ’ability to acquire
resources or maintain autonomy.
Implementation strategies should address
potential constraints of implementation on
resource acquisition or autonomy.Organizations will forge relationships to
implement SafeCare insofar as doing so will
yield resources that are worth more than the
related decrease in autonomy.Birken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 10 of 15
approaches for managing contractual relationship for im-
plementation given the trend toward privatization and con-
tracting in health and human services [79].
Third, in this paper, we apply organizational theory in a
qualitative fashion; this diver ges from the largely quantita-
tive application of organizational theory in other areas of
health services research (e.g., [80]). Our retrospective, quali-
tative application of organizational theory provides an ex-
planation for SafeCare implementation; however, we do not
test hypotheses derived from TCE, RDT, institutional the-
ory, or contingency theories. In contrast, quantitative ap-
proaches or deliberately design ed qualitative studies might
be more conducive to testing hypotheses derived from the
application of these four theories to implementation.
Despite these limitations, our paper has important im-
plications for implementation strategies, the evaluation
of implementation efforts, measurement, research de-
sign, theory, and practice.
Implementation strategies consist of practical ap-
proaches to promote EBI adoption, implementation, and
sustainability [81]. Domains of implementation strategies
include planning, education, financing, restructuring,
quality management, and attending to the policy context
[82]. Applying organizational theory to implementation
strategies helps to explain why these strategies promote
implementation and may promote more effective strategy
selection. For example, TCE suggests that quality manage-
ment may promote implementation by decreasing trans-
action costs associated with desired behaviors. TCE also
encourages implementation practitioners to account for
the transaction costs associated with a given strategy; the
transaction costs associated with resource-intensive re-
structuring, for example, may outweigh its potential bene-
fits to implementation. Institutional theory suggests that
some strategies may have objective benefits to implemen-
tation as well as conferring legitimacy on the organization
implementing the EBI. For example, the legitimacy associ-
ated with engaging in quality management, regardless of
its objective benefits, may be sufficient to use such a strat-
egy. Contingency theories suggest that strategies are not
one-size-fits-all —organizations must select and tailor
strategies to their internal and external contexts —ap e r -
spective that has been advocated to promote implementa-
tion strategies ’effectiveness [83]. RDT suggests that some
strategies may be successful in promoting implementation
by maintaining a balance between autonomy and depend-
ence on others. For example, education of staff may act as
a mechanism for gaining autonomy from EBI experts.
Organizational leaders may benefitting from select imple-
mentation strategies with a desired balance between au-
tonomy and dependence on other organizations in mind.
Organizational theory also has implications for imple-
mentation evaluation. Increasingly, theory-driven evalu-
ation (e.g., [84]), such as process analyses and N-of-1trials, complement traditional randomized controlled tri-
als of implementation outcomes by suggesting mecha-
nisms underlying the relationship between an EBI and its
outcomes [85]. Organizational theory suggests that trans-
action costs; needs for autonomy, resources, and legitim-
acy; and internal or external contexts may drive EBI
outcomes. Drawing on organizational theories in imple-
mentation research will require development of measures
such as institutional pressures (coercive, normative, and
mimetic) [46, 47]; resource complexity, availability, and
stability that influence organizational dependence/auton-
omy (e.g., [86]); and the uncertainty, asset specificity, and
transaction costs (e.g., [87]) associated with organizational
“make vs. buy ”decisions. These and other constructs
characterizing the external organizational environment
have been somewhat absent in prior implementation stud-
ies [88] and limited in the larger organizational literature
as well [87] due to definitional ambiguity and imprecision
[89]. Clear definitions to guide measurement development
will be critical, as well as examination of the merits of
using objective versus perceived measures of the context
[90]. Although objective measures are generally preferred,
organizational leaders make decisions based on how they
perceive the context, and therefore, perceptual or self-
report measures might also be valid [91]. Finally, scholars
will need to carefully consider the unit of analysis, for in-
stance, whether the institutional or resource environments
can be captured via aggregated organizational reports.
Implementation researchers who use the lens of
organizational theory will likely need to adjust their ap-
proach to design. Applying organizational theory often
(but not exclusively, in the case of RDT, for example)
implies analysis at the organizational level. Particularly
for quantitative studies, such as experiments or quasi-
experiments, recruiting a number of organizations to
achieve sufficient power may be challenging. In contrast
to studies at the provider or individual level, in which
participants may be difficult to recruit but are plentiful,
organizations both are often difficult to recruit and are
scarce, relative to individuals. For observational, qualita-
tive studies, relatively small numbers of organizations
may be sufficient to achieve study objectives. However,
organizational policies and the process of consenting an
organization can make study recruitment challenging.
For example, recruiting organizations requires an agent
of the organization —typically a top leader —to consent
on behalf of the organization; in many cases,
organizational research requires the participation of em-
ployees whose responses are aggregated to the
organizational level, and organizational consent does not
imply employees ’consent [92]. Research at the
organizational level may also require longer study pe-
riods since organizational change, including success or
failure outcomes, is often slow [78]. We recommend thatBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:62 Page 11 of 15
implementation researchers who wish to incorporate
organizational theory into their work collaborate with
researchers who have expertise in organizational theory
and research (often found in the fields of sociology, pub-
lic administration, political science, and management).
Implementation researchers who would like to apply
organizational theory may find useful introductory texts
on organizational theory [16, 93] and conferences that
feature studies that incorporate organizational theory,
such as the Association for Research on Nonprofit Orga-
nizations and Voluntary Action [94], the Health Care
Division of the Academy of Management [95], and the
Organizational Theory in Health Care Association [96].
We also recommend that implementation research
training programs, including doctoral programs and
postdoctoral training programs such as the Training In-
stitute on Dissemination and Implementation Research
in Health and the Implementation Research Institute, in-
corporate formal training in organizational theory. Other
fields ’(e.g., public administration [97 –99]) success in-
corporating organizational theory suggests that doing so
is feasible. Indeed, establishing common ground in
organizational theory may serve to promote collabora-
tions with these fields, which are currently lacking [100].
Our paper also suggests implications for theory. Broadly
speaking, organizational theories propose specific mani-
festations of organizations ’efforts to survive [78]: To sur-
vive, organizations minimize costs; adhere to values,
norms, and expectations of institutions within their envir-
onment; develop characteristics that differentiate them to
compete with others; and acquire resources and auton-
omy. Organizations implement innovations to survive —to
comply with accrediting bodies [101], to respond to
changing patient needs [102], to offer appealing services
in-house [103]. In this sense, implementation may be a de-
terminant of organizational survival; to the extent that
implementing an innovation does not promote survival,
implementation is unlikely to occur. Additionally, examin-
ing the barriers to implementation offers an opportunity
to investigate overlap across theories and to advance the-
ories that specify and explain cross-level influences (e.g.,
influences that span across organizational environment,
organizational behavior, and provider behavior).
Our paper also suggests that key organizational theor-
ies should be incorporated into implementation frame-
works. Developers of the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR) did not draw upon the
kinds of classic organizational theories that we advocate
for implementation research, but the CFIR includes con-
structs that relate to some key organizational theory
constructs [12]. For example, the CFIR ’s cosmopolitan-
ism domain (i.e., the extent to which an organization is
networked with others) suggests the importance of inter-
agency relationships. RDT provides a rationale forincluding this construct: Organizations with stronger
networks may facilitate implementation by increasing ac-
cess to resources including information, influence, and
funding [62]. Drawing on organizational theory, we can
further specify and expand upon constructs included in
implementation frameworks.
Finally, the application of organizational theories to im-
plementation has practical implications. Organizational
theories suggest that managers should be aware of influ-
ences from the external environment that may influence
adoption, implementation, and sustainment. TCE, for ex-
ample, suggests that having established relationships with
external organizations that influence implementation may
promote implementation success. Institutional theory sug-
gests that gaining legitimacy —regardless of whether it im-
proves performance —may drive adoption decisions. In
some cases, the drive to gain legitimacy may undermine
the objectives of an implementation effort; organizational
leaders may superficially implement an EBI, without
effecting change, to conform to institutional pressures.
Contingency theories suggest that successful implementa-
tion will likely require adaptation of an intervention to the
manager ’s unique organizational context. RDT suggests
that threats to maintaining autonomy or resources
represent threats to implementation and sustainment.
Organizational theory also encourages a skepticism of
practice trends. In response to practice trends, researchers
often assess strategies for accommodating these trends. In
contrast, organization theory can help to alert practi-
tioners and researchers to potential negative consequences
of practice trends. For example, institutional theory sug-
gests that following practice trends may confer legitimacy
but not necessarily performance improvement.
Conclusions
Organizational theories offer implementation researchers
a host of existing, highly relevant, and heretofore largely
untapped explanations of the complex interaction be-
tween organizations and their environment. Researchers
and practitioners may benefit from the insights into im-
plementation that organization theories offer.
