Abstract 
Background: Many individuals with intellectual disability (ID) have not learnt basic reading skills by the time that 
they reach adulthood, potentially limiting their access to critical information. READ-IT is an online reading programme 
developed from the Headsprout® Early Reading (HER®) intervention and supplemented by support strategies tailored 
for adults with ID. HER® has been successfully used to teach adults with ID to read in a forensic setting by trained staff. 
The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering READ-IT to adults with ID by family carers/support work -
ers and will assess whether it would be feasible to conduct a later definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the 
effectiveness of the programme. The study will aim to contribute to the evidence base on improving outcomes for 
adults with ID and their caregivers.
Methods: This study is a feasibility RCT, with embedded process evaluation. Forty-eight adults with ID will be 
recruited and allocated to intervention: control on a 1:1 basis. Intervention families will be offered the READ-IT pro -
gramme immediately, continuing to receive usual practice and control participants will be offered the opportunity 
to receive READ-IT at the end of the trial follow-up period and will continue to receive usual practice. Data will be 
collected at baseline and 6 months post-randomisation.
Discussion: The results of this study will inform a potential future definitive trial, to evaluate the effectiveness of 
READ-IT to improve reading skills. Such a trial would have significant scientific impact internationally in the intellectual 
disability field.

Background
Reading is an essential skill for daily life and a pre-requi -
site for independent living [1, 2]. Many individuals with 
ID (known as learning disability in UK health and social 
care services) have not learnt basic reading skills by the 
time that they are adults [3] and, as a cohort, have poor 
literacy skills [2]. An inability to read potentially limits 
a person’s access to critical information relevant to their 
daily lives and has been cited as a secondary impact of ID 
and the cause of significant additional limitations [4].
One of the ways of addressing a lack of reading skills 
is to make information more accessible using, for exam -
ple, Easy Read formats. Whilst this may be effective for 
some, recent research suggests that this is not always 
the case [5]. Easy Read may be presented in a way that 
cannot be tailored to meet individual needs [6, 7], and, 
critically it does not teach a person to read—a skill which 
may significantly improve that person’s independence, 
quality of life and overall participation in society [2] with 
implications both for the person and for those who sup -
port them. It should also be noted that what is meant by 
‘Easy Read’ is not standardised, including the inclusion or 
exclusion of text accompanying pictures. Research evi -
dence indicates that young people with ID want the same 
things as anyone else—to be able to live independently if 
they so choose, to have friends, a family and to have a job 
[8]. However, the gap between aspirations and outcomes 
is much greater amongst people with ID than the wider 
population and, as they move into adulthood, that gap 
gets wider [8]. The ability to read is a key to achieving 
many of these aspirations.
The relationship between levels of proficiency in liter -
acy and employment outcomes for example is well estab -
lished for the population as a whole [9], and poor literacy 
skills have been identified as a barrier to employment for 
people with ID [10]. Even if the ability to read is not a 
job requirement, it is needed to read job advertisements, 
complete application forms and to be able to follow pro -
cedures and instructions at work.
Making healthy lifestyle decisions is another exam -
ple. A recently conducted study analysing primary 
health-care data on 1,424,378 adults found, even when 
accounting for factors such as neighbourhood depriva -
tion, increased co-morbidity with other healthcare issues 
and lower mortality rates in the cohort of adults with ID 
compared to the general population [11]. Reducing this 
inequality requires initiatives tailored for adults with ID. 
One of the problems, however, is access to information that might directly empower adults with ID themselves 
which in turn depends upon health literacy [12]. Many 
policy initiatives directed at providing that information 
to the general population are unlikely to benefit people 
with ID and, as noted above, attempts to increase the 
accessibility of information are not always effective. This 
often places a responsibility on carers to mediate access 
to information.
There is also an emerging body of research that sug -
gests that being able to read can increase the quality of 
life of individuals with ID helping with additional skills 
development such as problem-solving, making informed 
choices and increasing access to the community [2, 13].
There is relatively little research into the reading skills 
of adults with ID and even less on effective interventions. 
In part, this has been because of a non-evidence-based 
perception that it is not possible to teach people with ID 
to read, whatever their age [14] and more generally that 
the ability to learn plateaus in adults with ID [15, 16]. 
Furthermore, the focus of support as children with ID 
gets older and transition to adulthood often moves away 
from an academic to more functional curricula with an 
emphasis on the communication, social and daily living 
skills deemed necessary for adult life [17]. More recently, 
these assumptions have been challenged. Studies have 
shown that it is possible with appropriate teaching and 
learning strategies, to teach people with ID reading 
skills [18–20] and, although learning may progress more 
slowly, that it is possible for adults with ID to continue to 
learn into adulthood, including learning to read [21, 22].
There has been, however, no high-quality research evi -
dence supported by a randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
of the effectiveness of strategies to teach adults with ID to 
read. Much of the research into improved reading skills 
is with typically developing children. In the UK, the edu -
cation endowment foundation (EEF) recommends imple -
menting a systematic phonics programme for children, 
and, because learning to read is not an innate ability, 
Gough and Hillinger [23] recommended teaching strat -
egies include repeated instruction and opportunities to 
practice learning to decode text. A systematic review of 
the literature of teaching strategies to improve reading 
skills in people with ID concluded that intense practice 
and instruction is needed and that it should be provided 
‘explicitly, systematically, and consistently’ and found no 
RCTs of reading interventions for adults with ID [24].

the three early reading skills involved in decoding that 
are part of five critical areas of learning to read: phone -
mic awareness, phonics and fluency (the other two areas 
being vocabulary and text comprehension). The ability to 
decode is an essential component to becoming a profi -
cient reader. HER® [25] involves repeated opportunities 
to practice decoding and sounding out words, work -
ing at the pace of the individual and to suit their needs 
through 80 online episodes/sessions. HER® has been 
shown to be effective with typically developing children 
in large scale implementation studies, including a RCT 
in the USA [26]. A small UK-based RCT also suggests 
positive outcomes for HER® versus the usual teaching 
of reading with children with mild to moderate intellec -
tual disabilities in a mainstream school setting [27]. Our 
pilot research with small numbers of children in special 
schools and special resource units has suggested that, 
with the inclusion of some additional support strategies, 
HER® can also be effective for children with ID [27–29] 
especially (but not limited to) those children with the 
following pre-requisite skills: able to speak clearly, can 
verbally repeat words modelled to them, are capable of 
following simple instructions, and have basic computer/
touch screen skills (i.e. are able to move and click a mouse 
appropriately—mouse skills can also be directly taught to 
increase access). Teaching that is delivered online rather 
than face-to-face may be easier for people of any age with 
ID to access, offers a learning experience tailored to their 
needs and may be more cost effective compared to one-
to-one instruction from trained professionals. Critically, 
it also offers access to more people than can be achieved 
through one-to-one or even small group instruction.
In the first study to explore the use of HER® to teach 
basic reading skills to adults with a mild ID, the feasibil -
ity of running the intervention in a forensic setting was 
demonstrated and showed improved decoding skills criti -
cal to reading and self-concept scores for participants [3]. 
No adaptations were needed for the online programme, 
but trained staff were available to supervise the pro -
gramme and it was easy to schedule it into the working 
day. However, working in a secure setting is not the same 
as typical community and social care settings for people 
with ID.
A manual incorporating additional support strategies 
that can be used alongside the standard HER® online 
programme for anyone helping children with ID to read 
in home or school settings has been developed by the 
research team. It has been specifically developed for 
teachers, teaching assistants and parents mediating their 
pupil/child’s programme, but will be adapted for support 
workers and family carers working with adults with ID.
There is a current gap in the availability of suitable 
reading programmes for adults with ID, in the evidence base around teaching adults with ID new skills and, 
critically, in the potential impact that teaching adults to 
read has on their ability to access information relevant 
to healthy lifestyles, independence, informed choice 
and ultimately quality of life. READ-IT, and the current 
research proposal, directly address that gap.
Methods/design
Objectives/aim
The aim of this feasibility RCT is to assess the feasibil -
ity of delivering a reading intervention to adults with ID 
by family carers/support workers. The study will aim to 
contribute to the evidence base on improving outcomes 
for adults with ID and their caregivers. Importantly, the 
study will inform a potential, definitive RCT of the effec -
tiveness and cost-effectiveness of the programme. The 
study primary objective is to examine whether READ-
IT can be delivered successfully by community support 
workers/family carers. The study secondary objective is 
to assess whether it would be feasible to conduct a later 
definitive RCT of the effectiveness and cost effectiveness 
of READ-IT.
Study design
The study is a 2-arm, randomised controlled trial, with 
1:1 randomisation using randomly permuted blocks, 
stratified by setting type (family home vs. other social 
care setting).
The study will be composed of three stages:
Stage 1: Intervention refinement and development.
A new intervention (READ-IT) will be developed by fur -
ther adapting the HER® support manual specifically for 
use with support workers and family carers of adults and 
detailing a supervision/mentoring process during the 
intervention delivery. The intervention will be capable of 
being delivered in full remotely—a critical factor in study 
development in a COVID-19 environment. Stage 1 will 
also include the development of a protocol for obtain -
ing informed consent and data collection remotely and 
an adaptation for online delivery of all measures used in 
data collection. These and the procedure for obtaining 
informed consent will be developed and piloted using 
public and participant involvement (PPI).
Stage 2: Feasibility study
The intervention arm participants will participate in an 
online reading programme (HER®) supplemented by 
additional support strategies tailored for adults with ID. 
Support workers and carers will receive a half-day train -
ing (delivered remotely) and be given a copy of the sup -
port manual. All support workers and family carers will 
in addition be offered bi-weekly ‘phone-in’ help sessions 
Page 4 of 12 Moody et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:13 
over the duration of the intervention. The control arm 
participants will experience usual practice in relation to 
the support of their reading and will have access to the 
(HER®) programme after 12 months; however, HER® 
training or mentoring will not be available to the control 
arm participants. Baseline measures for all participants 
will be conducted remotely prior to randomisation and 
repeated 6 months post randomisation. Selected partici -
pants will be approached 6 months post randomisation 
to take part in a qualitative study designed to address the 
progression criteria that will not otherwise be clear from 
other data collected.
Stage 3: Logic model/full trial protocol
The findings from the feasibility study will be used to 
review and refine a logic model and, subject to the pro -
gression criteria being met, will lead to the development 
of a protocol for a full trial. This will be achieved through 
additional PPI input and with the advisory group.
Study setting
Individuals will be recruited from family homes, inde -
pendent living and small group settings (e.g. supported 
living and residential homes). Settings for people likely 
to be eligible (those with mild to moderate ID) are most 
likely to be individual (with their family, or in independ -
ent living). This is a single site study.
Site selection
This is a single site study and will be carried out at Uni -
versity of Warwick, under the supervision of the Chief 
Investigator.
Participant selection
Individuals will be recruited from family homes, inde -
pendent living and small group settings (e.g., supported 
living and residential homes). Families will be directed 
to the study team by service provider organisations in 
their local area following a flexible multi-point recruit -
ment method including via targeted service provider 
organisations, practitioner fora, local and national chari -
table support organisations, local parent carer fora and 
self-referral. The strategy is aimed to be flexible and col -
laborative and information will be gathered regarding 
the most effective participant identification processes to 
inform a definitive trial. All potential participants will 
have been provided with a participant information sheet 
and will have confirmed interest in participating in the 
study either directly with the service provider organisa -
tion or by returning a completed reply slip to the study 
team. Potential participants will be contacted by study 
team researchers to arrange a short screening/recruit -
ment interview, via videoconferencing. Participants are eligible for the study if they meet all of the inclusion cri -
teria and none of the exclusion criteria apply.
Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria Adults administratively defined as 
having an ID (i.e. through receipt of/being known to ser -
vices) who:
1. have the capacity to give informed consent
2. have a level of competence in understanding English 
suitable to access Headsprout® Early Reading pro -
gramme. This is assessed via a placement assessment 
that is provided by HER® to assess where within the 
intervention the individual is best advised to start 
and assesses upper-reading ability.
3. can sound out words (although degree of articula -
tion will not be a factor). (Sounding out words is a 
requirement of the HER® component of the inter -
vention).
4. have access to appropriate internet-enabled technol -
ogy
5. either have basic mouse skills, or the capacity to be 
taught basic mouse skills
6. are living in a setting in which they are getting daily 
living skills support supported by a support worker/
family carer
7. have access to a supporter who is themselves able 
to read and willing to support the individual for the 
duration of the study
Exclusion criteria Adults with ID with visual impair -
ments are severe enough to limit their access to com -
puter-based technology even with adaptations. Adults 
with ID whose reading skills are too proficient to bene -
fit from the programme, this is assessed by a placement 
assessment that is provided by HER®.
Intervention
The intervention arm participants will participate in an 
online reading programme (HER®) supplemented by 
additional support strategies tailored for adults with ID: 
READ-IT. HER® has been successfully used to teach 
adults with ID to read. In a pilot study [3], no adaptations 
were needed to the online programme. However, the 
intervention was mediated by trained staff who provided 
additional support when necessary to the participants. 
HER® has also been successfully used to teach children 
with ID, again without any adjustments to the pro -
gramme itself (which is a commercially available prod -
uct) but using other additional supports and adaptations. 
Page 5 of 12
 Moody et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:13 
 
These adaptations have been fully described in a manual, 
developed by our team, for teachers, teaching assistants 
and parents mediating the reading intervention. A new 
intervention (READ-IT) will be developed by further 
developing the adaptations/support manual specifically 
for support workers and family carers so that those sup -
porting adults with ID are able, in turn to assist with 
the reading intervention, and detailing a supervision/
mentoring process during the intervention delivery. 
The intervention will be provided remotely in the par -
ticipant’s home or day care centre. The adaptation of the 
support manual will be achieved through a PPI model 
in collaboration with Mencap who is the social care and 
PPI partner. The research team will also develop a fidelity 
framework to identify both the fidelity factors included 
in the HER® programme itself as well as any additional 
factors associated with adherence to the support manual 
and engagement with the supervision/mentoring process.
The HER® programme consists of 80 online episodes 
delivered in sessions of approximately 20-25 min. HER® 
recommends between 3 and 6 sessions of 20 to 25 min 
per week. READ-IT will therefore be delivered on aver -
age 16-20 weeks. Following recruitment and randomisa -
tion, support workers/family carers in the intervention 
group will be invited to attend a half-day remote training 
workshop. The purpose of training will be to demonstrate 
how the HER® online programme works and how the 
support manual can be used by support workers/family 
carers to help the person that they are supporting. Two 
options for training dates each month will be offered. 
Support workers and carers will be given a copy of the 
support manual and a unique code to access the HER® 
programme. All support workers and family carers will, 
in addition, be offered bi-weekly phone-in help sessions 
over the duration of the intervention. The intervention 
for each participant will begin once their support worker/
family carer has completed the training.
Usual practice/comparator
The comparator intervention will be usual practice (UP) 
with waitlist READ-IT. However, no HER® training or 
support will be available to the control arm participants 
during the study period.
Retention strategy
To maintain engagement, encourage retention and to 
thank participants for their time, £20 per participant will 
be provided per adult during both the initial survey and 
again at the 6-month point. Support workers/family car -
ers will also be offered £10 during both the initial survey 
and again at the 6-month point [30]. Participants taking 
part in qualitative interviews will also be provided with 
a £20 voucher to thank them for their time [30]. Contact details will be collected during recruitment, and partici -
pants will be reminded by email and text message when a 
data collection follow-up is due.
Sample size calculation
A total of 48 individuals will be recruited (randomising 
24 per arm). As this is a feasibility study, and the purpose 
is to provide estimates of key parameters for a future trial 
rather than to power the current study to detect statisti -
cally significant differences, a formal a priori power cal -
culation will not be conducted [31]. However, recruiting 
48 participants will provide a certain level of precision 
around a 95% confidence interval. For example, if 80% of 
participants provide outcome data at follow-up, the 95% 
confidence interval around the percentage can be esti -
mated within +/− 11% (i.e. 69 to 91%).
Outcomes—spirit figure
The study primary objective is to examine whether 
READ-IT can be delivered successfully by community 
support workers/family carers. The feasibility of using a 
range of established outcome measures, proposed to test 
the intervention in a main trial, will be assessed:
1. Dynamic indicators of basic early literacy skills 
(DIBELS) which assesses the decoding skills involved 
in reading
2. A measure of reading self-efficacy (and carer effi -
cacy in supporting the person to read), these will be 
designed as part of the patient and public involve -
ment (PPI) workshops
3. Quality of life measures for the person with ID: 
EQ5D-3L (health-related quality of life), the personal 
well-being index intellectual disability version, com -
pleted by the person with ID and the family member/
support staff member
4. The version of the client service receipt inventory 
(CSRI) used in recent ID trials will be used to exam -
ine the feasibility of collecting these data for a future 
health economics analysis, primarily from carers/
support staff
The following will also be assessed:
5. Adherence to the READ-IT intervention
6. Fidelity of READ-IT intervention delivery and the 
most effective measure to assess fidelity

measures (SPIRIT figure) and Additional file  1 for SPIRIT 
checklist.

Participant flow/ procedure
Figure 1 illustrates the study flowchart.
Data collection methods
Participant identification The main strategy for recruit -
ment is to contact those social care provider organisa -
tions. Social media advertising will be utilised. Local ID 
charity organisations and parent carer fora (through the 
National Parent Carer Forum) will also be contacted. It 
is expected that settings for people likely to be eligible 
(those with mild to moderate ID) are most likely to be 
individual (with their family, or in independent living). 
Thus, a cluster randomised design is unlikely to be rel -
evant. However, as there is a small risk of contamination in group settings using this design, only one adult with 
ID and their support worker per group setting will be 
recruited. During recruitment, a record will be kept of 
the number of instances in which there is more than one 
person eligible and interested in taking part within the 
same setting. This issue will also be explored in the quali -
tative interviews with support staff working in group 
settings. These data will inform the choice of research 
design for a future definitive trial.
Screening, recruitment and consent In order to detect 
any biases from differential recruitment, a log of all par -
ticipants considered/approached, including details of the 
recruitment pathway (via social media or via provider 
agencies) and whether they are ineligible or eligible will 
be completed. Provider agencies will be asked to com -
plete a log of the number of potential participants they 
contact about the study. Both the adult with ID and their 
family carer/support worker will be consented into the 
study. There will be two versions of the participant infor -
mation sheet (PIS), one will be provided to the family 
carer/support worker and one will be a version utilising 
images to assist with understanding will be provided to 
the adult with ID (participant). The participant and fam -
ily carer/support worker will have been sent the partici -
pant information sheet and consent form prior complet -
ing any measures and given sufficient time to discuss the 
information with their support worker/family carer. The 
study will be explained in detail, including randomisation Table 1 Participant timeline (SPIRIT figure): schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments

and consent for long-term follow-up. A placement 
assessment that is provided by HER® to assess where 
within the intervention the individual is best advised to 
start will be used for eligibility screening across all par -
ticipants prior to baseline data collection. Consent will 
be gained for this eligibility assessment. If a participant is happy to take part, informed consent will be obtained. 
Consent will be taken either face-to-face or via videocon -
ferencing. The study research assistant (S-RA) will read 
aloud each statement of the consent form and ask the 
participant to agree to each statement and approve that 
each one is signed individually. The S-RA will then sign Fig. 1 Study flowchart
Page 8 of 12 Moody et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:13 
on the participants’ behalf if this process is completed 
virtually. Once consent is gained, the following will be 
completed:
• A contacts form will be completed for participants 
including multiple methods of contact (address, tel -
ephone, email address) to minimise loss to follow-up.
• Baseline data collection completed (either at time of 
recruitment or at a suitable time for the participant). 
This will either be completed face-to-face or virtually 
via teleconferencing.
The addition of the option of completing consent and 
data collection virtually was included as a result of 
COVID-19 restrictions.
Randomisation
Participants will be randomised following screening and 
completion of baseline assessments. Participants will be 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a block randomisation 
programme developed by the Centre for Trials Research 
(CTR). Allocations will be balanced by setting type (fam -
ily home vs. other social care setting). Participants will 
be randomised to READ-IT in addition to usual prac -
tice or Usual Practice alone (i.e. for their reading from 
those within their care environment). The research assis -
tant providing on-going intervention support (this must 
not be the S-RA collecting baseline and follow-up data 
as they should remain blind to allocation, the interven -
tion research assistant (I-RA)) will inform participants 
and their support workers/family carers of their alloca -
tion by telephone and will provide all details of start -
ing the READ-IT programme to those allocated to the 
intervention arm. Randomisation will be performed by 
the study manager/data manager who will inform the 
I-RA of the allocation prior to their telephone call with 
the participant. Given that no more than one individual 
from a group setting will be recruited to the study, there 
is no danger of participants from the same setting being 
randomised into different trial arms, limiting the risk of 
contamination.
Frequency and duration of follow‑up
Data will be collected at 6 months post-randomisation. 
Participants will be contacted by the S-RA to complete 
this face-to-face or via teleconferencing. To reduce 
the risk of bias, the S-RA will read questions from the 
questionnaire directly, remain blind to the participants’ 
allocation and will ask participants not to reveal their 
allocation. If allocation is revealed, this will be noted.Process evaluation
A process evaluation will be based on the MRC frame -
work [32] and will incorporate data from the interviews, 
recruitment pathways and fidelity/adherence data to 
examine five key aspects of the feasibility of conducting 
a definitive trial of HER® for adults with ID: (1) interven -
tion recruitment, adherence and reach; (2) intervention 
implementation; (3) intervention mechanisms, including 
receipt and acceptability; (4) the impact of COVID-19 on 
service as usual and (5) the feasibility of implementing 
HER® within a definitive RCT.
Data management and security
Study data will be entered on to paper case report forms 
(CRFs) by the S-RA at the time of data collection and sub -
sequently entered on to a MS Access Database directly by 
the S-RA. A sample of CRFs will be scanned and checked 
visually on receipt by the study administrator, data man -
ager or study manager. RAs will be trained in good clini -
cal practice (GCP) and study specific processes. Hard 
copies of personally identifiable and research data will be 
held separately and securely in a locked cupboard, with 
access limited to essential research team members. CRFs 
will be pseudonymised and data entered manually onto 
a secure, password-protected Microsoft SQL database 
by the study administrator (SA) and data queries noted. 
Ten percent of all data will be quality checked and all 
data queries actioned by the data manager (DM). Any 
key data queries will be taken to the study management 
group (SMG) or SSC as appropriate. Wherever possible, 
data will be validated at point of entry, thereby reduc -
ing the opportunity for missing or unexpected data. All 
changes made to the data will be recorded and visible 
via an audit log within the database. Finally, data will be 
checked during data cleaning using SPSS syntax for vali -
dations and missing data. Qualitative interviews will be 
conducted remotely, recorded via the encrypted services 
offered by the platform used and stored on password-
protected computers at site. Recordings will be securely 
transferred to the study team at the CTR by Fastfile or 
courier. All files will be encrypted and transcripts will 
be fully pseudonymised prior to analysis. Data security 
and confidentiality will be ensured, in line with GDPR. 
A data management plan will be completed and adhered 
to. Only the trial team will have access to the final study 
dataset.
Statistical methods/analysis plan
The majority of outcome analysis will be descriptive 
in nature. Continuous data will be reported as means 
and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile 
ranges, as appropriate. Categorical data will be reported 
Page 9 of 12
 Moody et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:13 
 
as frequencies and proportions. All data will be reported 
both overall, per arm and by setting type. Outcomes 
will be estimated with their associated 95% confidence 
intervals. No formal hypothesis testing will take place. 
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written and 
agreed by the study management team prior to any analy -
sis taking place. The estimates obtained from the feasibil -
ity questions will be used to inform the design, sample 
size, randomisation strategy and analytical approach for a 
definitive effectiveness study. The findings from the study 
will be reported in line with the CONSORT extension for 
pilot and feasibility studies [33].
Cost effectiveness methods/analysis plan
Whilst no formal economic analysis will take place, con -
sideration will be given to the practicalities and difficul -
ties associated with collection of quality of life and CSRI 
data that would be needed in a future trial.
Qualitative methods/analysis plan
Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted 
with a selection of adults with ID, support workers and 
family carers delivering READ-IT, after the 6-month 
follow-up assessment. Sufficient interviews will be con -
ducted to achieve ‘information power’ [34] which focuses 
on the quantity and quality of information gathered rel -
evant to the research question rather than sample size, 
but is likely to include 8 to 12 adults with ID with similar 
numbers of support workers and family carers. Thematic 
analysis as outlined by Braun and Clarke [35] will be used 
to analyse the data, with a focus on identifying patterns 
of shared meaning.
Progression criteria for a definitive trial
Criteria will inform the decision to progress to a defini -
tive trial, with consideration to issues that may have 
affected meeting any of these criteria and steps that can 
be taken to overcome these issues within a full trial. 
These will be based on a traffic light system with green 
indicating ‘go without any modification necessary’; amber 
indicating ‘potential proceed to definitive trial, remedy -
ing early issues’; red indicating ‘stop’ .
• Participant recruitment: % of participants 
approached, and who are eligible, consent to the 
study (and thus are willing to be randomised)
 Green ≥50%
 Amber 30≥<50%
 Red <30%• Individual randomisation possible (% of total num -
ber of settings in which more than one participant 
is eligible and willing to take part) (NB. Amber/red 
here may lead to a proposal for a cluster randomised 
design)
 Green ≤20%
 Amber 20>≤40%
 Red >40%
• Rate of recruitment: % of recruitment target (48 par -
ticipants) are recruited within the study recruitment 
period
 Green 100%
 Amber 70≥<100%
 Red <70%
• Participant retention: % of participants retained 6 
month follow-up data collection timepoint
 Green 75<>100%
 Amber 50≥<70%
 Red <50%
• Usual practice: % of participants in the UP arm of 
the study who receive an alternative structured pro -
gramme designed to teach them to read between 
baseline and 6 month follow-up
 Green ≤30%
 Amber 30>≤50%
 Red >50%
• Fidelity: Self-rating forms indicate % of READ-IT 
manual components have been met both across and 
within sessions.
 Green 70<>100%
 Amber 50≥<70%
 Red <50%
• Adherence: % of participants and their support 
workers/family carers who adhere to the READ-IT 
programme (attend training, complete 80 episodes 
within 20 weeks, meet adherence criteria built into 
HER® programme)
 Green >70%
 Amber 50≥<70%
 Red <50%
• SSC consensus—considering all progression crite -
ria, feasibility study findings and evidence of whether 
progression criteria not met can be mitigated, a clear 
majority of the SSC independent members recom -
mend progression to a definitive trial
Adverse event reporting
There are no expected adverse events related to the 
intervention or research procedures; the NHS Health 
Research Authority, London - Camberwell St Giles 
Research Ethics Committee have approved that adverse 
events should not be reported for this study.
Page 10 of 12 Moody et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:13 
Auditing
No independent audits are planned.
Study governance
Ethical approval for this study was given by the NHS 
Health Research Authority, London - Camberwell St 
Giles Research Ethics Committee on 3 December 2019, 
reference number 19/LO/1784. Any protocol amend -
ments will be approved by the NHS Health Research 
Authority, London - Camberwell St Giles Research 
Ethics Committee. A SSC will meet approximately two 
to three times over the course of the study to provide 
oversight. The SSC will consist of an independent chair 
with expertise in ID research and trials research, an 
independent ID expert/clinician, independent statisti -
cian and a family carer representative (family member 
of adult with ID).
Confidentiality
All data will be kept for 15 years in line with Cardiff  
University’s Research Governance Framework Regula -
tions for clinical research. Electronic data will be stored 
confidentially on password-protected servers main -
tained on University networks. All hard copy forms 
will be stored in locked filing cabinets. For participant 
interviews, all audio files will be recorded on encrypted 
audio-recorders and securely held in password-pro -
tected servers maintained on University networks. 
Audio files will be transcribed and pseudonymised 
using University-approved transcription companies. 
No identifiable data will be published.
Dissemination policy
A publication plan and dissemination policy will be 
written. Outputs from the READ-IT feasibility study 
will include open access peer reviewed journal arti -
cles in international academic journals, at national and 
international academic conferences at University pub -
lic engagement events and a lay summary of the results 
will be included on the CTR and University of Warwick 
websites. The results of the study will also be dissemi -
nated to all participants. The READ-IT team will work 
in partnership with Mencap for dissemination to stake -
holders including commissioners and policy makers. Dis -
semination events will be arranged for key stakeholders 
and policy makers. Any data requests should be made to 
the CTR. The CTR is a signatory of AllTrials and aims to 
make its research data available wherever possible.
Public involvement
The adaptation of the support manual will be achieved 
through a PPI model in collaboration with Mencap who is the social care and PPI partner. This will involve two 
workshops with adults with ID and their support work -
ers/family carers. The PPI workshops will be used to 
refine a logic model for the intervention and to develop 
a measure of reading self-efficacy for adults with ID 
which is grounded in everyday life. A mirror version of 
this measure will be provided for support workers/fam -
ily carers. An advisory group with members recruited 
from the PPI workshops will be established to review 
the findings of the study, progression criteria and 
key issues in the protocol for a full trial. The SSC will 
include an independent lay representative who is a fam -
ily member of an adult with ID.
Discussion
The current health/social care context suggests that 
research into skills development in adults with ID is 
timely. For example, the recently published NICE guid -
ance learning disabilities and behaviour that challenges: 
service design and delivery [36] reflects current policy in 
the support of people with ID in England with a focus on 
providing support services in the community. It contin -
ues to build upon the model of care outlined in the Man -
sell Report [18] as well as the transformation programme 
set out in Transforming care: A national response to 
‘Winterbourne View Hospital’ [19]. The policy pro -
gramme’s goal is to drive system-wide change and ena -
ble more people to live in the community, with the right 
support, and close to home with a specific aim to reduce 
the number of beds for people with a learning disabil -
ity in mental health hospitals 35% to 50% by 2019. This 
requires not only a focus on developing enabling com -
munities [20] but also on supporting individuals with ID 
to live in their communities, access services and teaching 
them the necessary skills to be active participants within 
these. The READ-IT logic model directly addresses this 
need by targeting reading—a critical skill. The results of 
this study will contribute to the evidence base on teach -
ing adults with ID to read and will be used to inform a 
potential future definitive trial, to evaluate the effective -
ness of READ-IT to improve reading skills. Such a trial 
would have significant scientific impact internationally in 
the intellectual disability field.
