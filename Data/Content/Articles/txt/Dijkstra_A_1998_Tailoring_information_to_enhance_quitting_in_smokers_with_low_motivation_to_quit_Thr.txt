Tailoring Information to Enhance Quitting in Smokers With Low
Motivation to Quit: Three Basic Efficacy Questions

Maastricht University
Tailoring information to a target individual's features is a promising line of development in
self-help interventions. In this article, 752 smokers with explicit low intention to quit were
randomly assigned to 1 of 5 conditions: (a) multiple tailored letters with self-help guide, (b)
multiple tailored letters only, (c) a single tailored letter with a self-help guide, (d) a single
tailored letter only, or (e) a nontailored intervention. Follow-up assessment took place 4
months after the intervention. Results indicated that the single tailored intervention only had
no surplus value compared with a nontailored look-alike intervention. The addition of a
self-help guide to a tailored intervention was only useful in highly dependent smokers, and
multiple tailoring was more effective than single tailoring. It remains important to elucidate
why and for whom certain tailored interventions are more effective.
Key words: smoking cessation, precontemplators, computer tailoring
In the Netherlands, 70% of smokers are not planning to
quit within the next 6 months (Mudde, Dolders, & De Vries,
1994). Although the percentage of these so-called precontem-
plators in the United States is lower (about 40%; Velicer,
Hughes, Fava, Prochaska, & DiClemente, 1995), they still
compose a significant proportion of the smoking population.
Precontemplating smokers have no interest in standardized
self-help materials, which are mostly designed for smokers
who are preparing to quit. However, by tailoring the content
of a smoking cessation intervention to a person's individual
features, such as their attitudes and motivational stage, even
this group of smokers might be encouraged to quit. Using
individual data, a computerized tailoring system can com-
pose complex intervention messages (De Vries, Willemsen,
Brug, Dijkstra, & Berben, 1995; Strecher et al., 1994;
Velicer et al., 1993). In the literature on computer-generated
tailored interventions, three main issues stand out.
The first and fundamental question is whether tailored
interventions have higher efficacy than nontailored interven-
tions. The ultimate test to assess whether this is the case is to
compare a tailored intervention with a nontailored interven-
tion with the same layout, length, and presentation, and that
addresses the same topics. Only a few studies have ad-
dressed the problem this thoroughly. The results of these
studies can be summarized as follows. Compared with a

leidenuniv.nl.nontailored intervention, a tailored intervention led to more
forward stage movement only in Black and low-income
women (Skinner, Strecher, & Hospers, 1994), to signifi-
cantly more quitters only in a group of lighter smokers
(Strecher et al., 1994), and to a lesser fat intake (especially in
the group of risk consumers) but not to larger changes in
fruit and vegetable consumption (Brug, Steenhuis, Van
Assema, & De Vries, 1995; also see Campbell et al., 1994).
The results show that tailored information can lead to more
changes in behavior than nontailored information, but the
effect may be limited to certain behaviors and subgroups.
The second question regarding tailoring is whether tai-
lored interventions in combination with a self-help guide
have higher efficacy than tailored interventions without this
addition. A literature search shows that two forms of tailored
interventions are used. The first form of tailored interven-
tions consists of only a few pages of information (De Vries et
al., 1995; Kreuter & Strecher, 1996; Owen, Ewins, & Lee,
1989; Strecher et al., 1994). The second form consists of a
tailored intervention in combination with a complementary
and nontailored self-help manual (Burling et al., 1989;
Curry, McBride, Grothaus, Louie, & Wagner, 1995; Curry,
Wagner, & Grothaus, 1991; Prochaska, DiClemente, Velicer,
& Rossi, 1993). The latter, more extensive intervention
could be more powerful. However, as far as we know, no
previous research has investigated the effect of tailored
information combined with a standardized self-help manual,
compared with only tailored information.
The third question is whether multiple tailored interven-
tions have higher efficacy than a single tailored intervention.
Offering multiple tailored interventions may provide addi-
tional strength to change behavior. For example, the tailored
information can be updated each time, and subsequent
tailored messages offer the opportunity to give feedback
about the direction and extent of changes in determinants of
behavior and of behavior itself. Brug, Glanz, Van Assema,

Kok, and Van Breukelen (1998) compared the effects of
giving tailored feedback twice with giving tailored feedback
once, in a randomized field trial. Giving tailored feedback
twice had significantly more effect on fat consumption and
vegetable intake than giving it once, although this was not
the case for fruit consumption.
The goal of the present study was to analyze whether
tailored information had more effect than nontailored infor-
mation, whether the addition of a standardized self-help
guide to a (complementary) tailored intervention had more
effect than a tailored intervention alone, and whether
multiple tailoring was more effective than single tailoring.
The high percentage of smokers with low motivation to quit
in the Netherlands warrants the development and testing of
effective interventions for this group. Hence, in the present
experiment only smokers who were not planning to quit
within the next 6 months participated.
Method
Recruitment
Smokers were recruited by advertisements in local newspapers
throughout the Netherlands, in which they were asked to volunteer
for a research project on smoking and smoking cessation. Specific
measures were taken to recruit a sample of smokers with low
intention to quit. First, in the advertisements the target group was
defined as "Smokers who are not planning to quit within the next 6
months, or may be planning to never quit." Second, to minimize a
selective sampling, it was stated explicitly that smokers did not
have to quit to join in the present study. Third, respondents
completing all of the questionnaires were offered the opportunity to
win 20 bonus prizes amounting to $100.
After smokers had phoned the university in order to register
(N = 925), they were sent the pretest questionnaire that could bereturned in a prepaid envelope. After 2 weeks, 795 pretest
questionnaires (86%) had been returned. Of these questionnaires,
43 were excluded because the respondents smoked only a pipe or
cigars or they did have plans to quit within the next 6 months. This
resulted in 752 respondents at Time 1 (Tl).
Design
Smokers were randomly assigned to one of five conditions
receiving (a) a tailored letter three times (multiple) with serf-help
guide (MTplus condition; n = 140), (b) three times (multiple) a
tailored letter only (MTonly condition; n = 156), (c) a single
tailored letter with a self-help guide (STplus condition; n = 157),
(d) a single tailored letter only (STonly condition; n — 152),or(e)a
single nontailored letter once (NT condition; n = 147). Two weeks
after the pretest questionnaires were returned (Tl), the participants
were sent the intervention material (in the MT conditions the first
tailored letter) by mail; 4 months after the intervention, participants
were sent the posttest questionnaire (T2; see Figure 1).
Questionnaire
Because the present sample had a low motivation to quit at the
start of this study with short follow-up, it was expected that only a
few smokers would quit smoking. Hence, behavioral outcome
measures were regarded as less appropriate. Stage transition and
intention to quit were considered the primary outcome measures
(see Velicer, Prochaska, Rossi, & Snow, 1992; Velicer, Rossi,
Prochaska, & DiClemente, 1996).
Stages of change. Stages of change were assessed by confront-
ing smokers with different time plans with regard to smoking
cessation. The present stage model distinguishes between smokers
in four stages with increasing readiness to quit: immotives,
precontemplators, contemplators, and preparers. Immotives are not
planning to quit within the next 5 years or they may be planning
never to quit, and precontemplators are planning to quit within the

TAILORED SMOKING CESSATION INTERVENTIONS 515
next 5 years but not within the next 6 months (Dijkstra, Bakker, &
De Vries, 1997; Dijkstra, Roijackers, & De Vries, 1998). Contem-
plators are planning to quit within the next 6 months, whereas
preparers are planning to quit within the next 30 days (Dijkstra, De
Vries, & Bakker, 1996; Prochaska, DiClemente, & Norcross,
1992). Smokers who had refrained from smoking for the previous
24 hrs were considered to be in the action stage.
Stage transition. Stage transition was assessed by dichotomiz-
ing changes in stage: Forward transition was scored as 1, versus no
transition or backward transition, which was scored as 0.
Intention to quit. Intention to quit was measured with a
composite of three 10-point scales: "Do you intend to quit
smoking: (a) within the next 6 months, (b) within the next 5 years,
(c) ever?" The items could be scored from not at all (1) to very
much (10). The composite intention score was the average item
score (range 1-10). Cronbach's reliability (a) was .83.
Quitting behavior. Quitting behavior was used as an outcome
measure. Quitting behavior was first measured by asking partici-
pants whether they had engaged in a 24-hr quit attempt since the
first measurement (yes or no). Second, a more conservative
criterion was used to assess smoking cessation: "Have you smoked
in the last 7 days? (even one puff)" (yes or no).
To check whether the randomization procedure was successful
with regard to some relevant determinants of quitting behavior,
smokers in the five groups at Tl were compared on scale scores on
positive and negative outcome expectations, perceived self-
efficacy, smoking behavior, and demographics. The individual data
were also used as the basis for the tailored interventions.
Expected outcomes. A total of 33 items, validated in earlier
studies (Dijkstra, De Vries, & Bakker, 1996; Dijkstra et al., 1997),
assessed the expected outcomes of quitting (Bandura, 1986).
Expected positive outcomes were assessed with a 23-item scale
(a = .90). Expected negative outcomes were assessed with a
10-item scale (ct = .82).
Self-efficacy expectations. In all, 13 items assessed self-
efficacy expectations with regard to the ability to refrain from
smoking in social and emotional situations (a = .94).
Heaviness of smoking. Heaviness of smoking was measured by
the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND; Heatherton,
Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991), which assesses smoking
habits: How much do you smoke? How soon after awaking? Is it
hard not to smoke in public places? Do you smoke when you are
ill? Do you smoke more in the morning? Which cigarette is most
difficult to give up? (range 0-10; a = .71).
Smoking behavior. Smoking behavior was measured by asking
smokers how many years they had been smoking, how many
cigarettes they smoked on average, and whether they had engaged
in a 24-hr quit attempt in the last 12 months.
Demographics. Demographics measured were gender, age,
and education level, which was categorized as low, medium, or
high.
Program evaluation. All of the participants were asked to what
extent they had read and remembered the (first) intervention
message and to what extent they had learned from it. In the
conditions with a self-help guide, participants were asked to what
extent they had read the self-help guide and to what extent it had
been useful. All of these questions could be scored on a 10-point
scale ranging from not at all (I) to to a large extent (10).
No biochemical verification of the self-report quitting behavior
was conducted, because first, it was expected that the announce-
ment of a biochemical verification would increase nonresponse and
dropout, especially in the present sample with low motivation (see
Velicer et al., 1992). Moreover, the present study was characterized
by low demand, that is, at recruitment, smokers were told they didnot have to quit smoking; for this reason the self-report was
considered to be valid (see Velicer et al., 1992).
The Tailored Interventions
General principles. The computerized system to generate the
tailored letters was adapted from previous evaluations of minimal
interventions in smokers who were planning (Dijkstra, De Vries, &
Roijackers, 1998) and who were not planning to quit (Dijkstra, De
Vries, & Roijackers, 1996). The computer program combined
several potential parts of the message into one coherent interven-
tion message and provided an attractive layout. Information in the
tailored letters was adapted to the individual's stage of change,
perceived outcomes, situations! self-efficacy levels, and smoking
behavior. The letters offered feedback on the item level and
included individual information such as the name of the respondent
and the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Furthermore,
normative feedback was offered.
Content of the tailored interventions. Depending on the indi-
vidual item scores, the letters contained information on possible
outcomes of smoking and quitting, such as personal health
consequences and social consequences such as appreciation of
quitting by a nonsmoking partner. Restructuring information was
offered with regard to the expected negative outcomes of quitting,
such as weight gain and withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, the
letters contained information on skills to cope with social, emo-
tional, and habitual situations, depending on the individual confi-
dence scores. The letters in the single tailoring conditions consisted
of five to seven pages of information.
Multiple tailored interventions. The letters in the MT condi-
tions contained roughly the same information as the letters in the
ST conditions, but in the former, the information was distributed
over the three letters, each comprising four or five pages of
information. Each of the three letters contained information on
different outcomes of quitting and self-efficacy enhancing informa-
tion, that is, skills. In the second and third letters in the MT
conditions, participants were offered feedback on the extent and the
direction of their cognitive changes. In the two MT conditions, the
contents of the second and third letters were based on answers to a
10-min telephone questionnaire.
Tailored interventions plus self-help guide. In one of both the
ST and the MT conditions, the letters) referred to the 46-page
self-help manual that was sent with the (first) letter. This self-help
manual, in color, was developed to be used in a community
smoking cessation project (Mudde, De Vries, Willemsen, & Van
Assema, 1994). In the tailored letters, participants were referred to
a stage-matched chapter in the self-help manual.
Participant Characteristics
Of the 752 respondents, 60.2% were women; 23.4% had low,
40.4% medium, and 36.2% high education; and the mean age was
39.3 years. On average, they smoked 21.9 cigarettes a day, they had
smoked for 21.5 years, the mean FIND score was 5.15 (scale
ranging from 0 to 10), and 77.3% were classified as immotive
(22.7% precontemplator). Only 15.2% had engaged in a quit
attempt in the past 12 months. With regard to the cognitive
measures, the mean scores on the pros and cons of quitting (scales
ranging from 0 to 3) were 1.19 and 1.09, respectively. The mean
self-efficacy score (scale ranging from —3 to +3) was — 0.47, and
the mean intention score (scale ranging from 1 to 10) was 3.74.

Randomization and Attrition
To check the randomization, smokers in the five conditions were
compared on the variables mentioned in the participant characteris-
tics section. Chi-square tests for the discrete variables and F tests
for the continuous variables revealed no differences between the
conditions, with one exception. Smokers in the NT condition were
classified more often (p < .05) as immotive.
Attrition from Tl to T2 was 19.6% (n = 147; MTplus 21.4%;
MTonly 12.2%; STplus 17.8%; STonly 25%; NT 21.8%). Logistic
regression analysis, with attrition as the dependent variable and the
same variables as in the randomization check and condition as
independent variables, revealed that dropouts had smoked for
fewer years (p < .05), dropped out more often (p < .05) from the
NT condition than from the MTonly condition, and dropped out
more often (p < .01) from the ST only condition than from the
MTonly condition. Attrition in both MT conditions was 7.7% at the
first telephone contact and, compared with the first telephone
contact, 4.2% at the second telephone contact.
Statistical Analyses
Logistic regression was used for the binary outcome measures
(stage transition, 24-hr quit attempt, and 7 days quit) and linear
regression for the quantitative outcome measure (intention to quit).
All regression analyses were corrected for sex, age, education, and
stage at pretest. Because the intention to quit was not a meaningful
measure for participants who had quit smoking, participants who
reported having refrained from smoking for the last 24 hr were
excluded from the analyses on intention to quit. First, the four
tailored conditions were each compared with the nontailored
condition. The factor Condition was dummy-coded, using the NT
condition as the reference condition with which each other
condition was compared. Second, the factor Times (both MT
conditions vs. both ST conditions) and the factor Self-Help Guide
(SHG; both conditions with SHG vs. both conditions without SHG)
were computed. Times, SHG, the interaction Times X SHG, and
the covariates were entered in the regression equation. The NT
condition was excluded from these analyses. If the Times X SHG
interaction was significant (p < .05), the analyses were stratified
according to Times, otherwise the interaction was removed from
the analysis. If the interaction was not significant, it was removed
from equation and the main effects of Times and SHG were tested.
In order to study to what extent the effectiveness of the conditionsdiffered for subgroups of smokers, several interactions were tested.
That is, the interactions of Condition with stage, sex, age,
education, FTND score, and number of cigarettes were entered in
the equations. Because the latter two measures overlap, they were
entered separately. In the case of a significant interaction (p < .05),
the analyses were stratified.
Results
Program Evaluation
Table 1 shows the mean scores on the evaluation ques-
tions. First, comparing the four tailored conditions to the NT
condition, only smokers in the MTonly condition read
significantly more of the (first) letter and reported remember-
ing significantly more of it. Smokers in both MT conditions
learned significantly more from the letters than did smokers
in the NT condition. Second, comparing both MT condi-
tions, smokers in the MTonly condition read significantly
more of the first and the third letter. Third, comparing the
evaluation of the SHG in both conditions that offered the
SHG, no significant difference was found.
Tailoring Versus Nontailoring
Table 2 depicts the percentages (stage transition, quit
attempt, and 7 days quit) and mean scores (intention) on the
four outcome measures for each condition. None of the
planned interaction tests was significant. Compared with the
NT condition, both MT conditions led to higher percentages
of transitions (35.2% and 34.6% vs. 18.6%) and to a higher
intention to quit (M = 15.4 and 14.5 vs. 12.7). A contrast
analysis revealed no significant difference between both MT
conditions. The STplus condition and the MTonly condition
led to higher percentages of 24-hr quit attempts than did the
NT condition (13.4% and 13.1% vs. 6.1%). A contrast
analysis revealed no significant difference between both
conditions. With regard to the 7-days quit criterion, smokers
in the MTonly condition reported, at borderline significance,

having refrained more often from smoking for the past 7
days (7.4% vs. 3.6%).
Self-Help Guide Versus No Self-Help Guide
In the two-way analyses of all tailored conditions, exclud-
ing the NT condition, there was no significant Times X SHG
interaction with regard to all four outcome measures.
Therefore, the main effects of Times and SHG were tested.
Table 3 shows the percentages and means of the four
outcome measures for the conditions with the SHG and for
conditions without the SHG. There was a significant interac-
tion between Condition and FTND score with regard to
intention to quit and stage transition: In smokers who scored
low on the measure of nicotine dependence (-S, 5), the
addition of the SHG did not lead to a significantly higher
intention or to more stage transition. In smokers with
high FTND score (> 5), the addition of the SHG did lead
to a significantly higher intention to quit (M = 11.7 vs.
14.1) and to significantly more stage transition (20.6% vs.
32.2%).The data showed a borderline significant (p < .1) main
effect with regard to the 7-days quit criterion: The addition
of an SHG led to fewer quitters (4.4% vs. 1.3%).
Multiple Tailoring Versus Single Tailoring
Table 3 depicts the percentages and mean scores for both
MT conditions and both ST conditions. None of the planned
interaction tests was significant. With regard to stage
transition, the effect of both MT conditions exceeded that of
both ST conditions (34.9% vs. 20.7%). The same pattern
was found with regard to the intention to quit (M = 15.1 vs.
13.1) and the 7-days quit criterion (4.9% vs. 0.8%). The MT
conditions did not lead to significantly more 24-hr quit
attempts than did the ST conditions.
Analyses Including Dropouts
Because attrition at T2 could be predicted by the number
of years smoked, as reported at Tl and by Condition, the
present results might be influenced by selective dropout.

One way to address this problem is to use the last known
measurement (Tl) of each smoker who dropped out as a
substitute for the T2 measurement and repeat all analyses.
This intention to treat analysis (Heyting, Tolboom, & Essers,
1992) revealed that none of the results changed qualitatively.
Only minor changes in betas, odds ratios, and p values
emerged.
Discussion
The first question was whether tailored information would
lead to more changes than would nontailored information.
The strictest comparison was between the single tailored
intervention without the SHG and the nontailored look-alike
intervention. The data showed that the tailored intervention
was not more effective than the nontailored intervention.
The results of the program evaluation may shed some light
on the causes of this null finding. The program evaluation
data show that both single tailored interventions were read
and remembered to the same extent as the nontailored
intervention. This contrasts with the findings of Skinner et
al. (1994) and Campbell et al. (1994) and suggests that the
tailoring of the information did not, as expected (Dijkstra,
1996; Skinner et al., 1994), lead to increased curiosity and a
resulting enhanced attention to the message. First, the
tailored intervention might not have been tailored enough.
However, the content was adapted to several individual
cognitions, and the intervention contained personal informa-
tion, such as the name of the respondent, the number of
cigarettes smoked a day, the number of years smoked, and
the amount of money saved in the case of quitting. Second,
the fact that the single tailored intervention was not read and
remembered to a larger extent than the nontailored interven-
tion might be caused by the specific sample of smokers with
low motivation to quit: All smokers stated they were not
planning to quit within the next 6 months, and more than
77% stated they were not planning to quit within the next 5
years. This group can be expected to be highly resistant to
intention- and behavior-changing appeals. This resistance
may have resulted in the finding that the tailored interven-
tion was not read and remembered to a larger extent than the
nontailored intervention.
Both multiple tailored interventions did lead to more stage
transition and a higher intention to quit than did the
nontailored intervention, and the multiple tailored interven-
tion without the SHG led, in addition, to more quitting
behavior than did nontailored information. The power of
multiple tailoring was supported in the analyses in which
multiple tailoring was compared with single tailoring. The
data showed that on three out of four outcome measures, the
effect of multiple tailoring exceeded that of single tailoring,
whereas the letters in the multiple tailoring conditions
contained roughly the same information as the letters in the
single tailoring conditions. However, with the present study
design, the specific intervention elements that are respon-
sible for this effect of multiple tailoring cannot be identified.
For example, the effect of multiple tailoring might be caused
by the fact that the information on the pros and cons of
quitting and on the use of skills to quit was offered more thanonce. However, we do not know to what extent the tailoring
of this information was essential. Three subsequent and
related but nontailored letters might have similar efficacy.
Furthermore, we do not know to what extent the three
assessments—one mailed questionnaire and two additional
telephone interviews—contributed to the efficacy of mul-
tiple tailoring. Future research will have to address this
important issue by comparing the effects of a multiple
tailoring condition with, for example, the effects of a
multiple but nontailored condition and an assessment-only
condition.
The addition of a standardized SHG to a tailored interven-
tion led to a higher intention to quit, but, in contradiction, to
fewer 7 days quitting (borderline significance) in compari-
son with a tailored intervention only. The results were more
consistent when the analyses were stratified according to
nicotine dependence: Only in high nicotine dependent
smokers did the addition lead to a higher intention to quit
and to more stage transition. Strecher et al. (1994) found that
in heavy smokers, tailored messages did not lead to more
quitting than standardized or no information. They con-
cluded that heavy smokers need nicotine replacement in
addition to a psychosocial intervention. The present find-
ings, however, seem to support the notion that a more
extensive psychosocial intervention might be needed to
stimulate heavy smokers to quit. Both studies used different
outcome measures and might be combined: In the present
study, the differential effect for low and highly dependent
smokers was found on measures that, in a sample with low
motivation to quit, are important in early phases of the
process of smoking cessation. Strecher et al. (1994) used the
7-days quit criterion, which is important in later phases of
the smoking cessation process. Hence, in motivating heavy
smokers to quit, a more extensive psychosocial intervention
might be needed, whereas in supporting actual quitting in
heavy smokers, additional nicotine replacement might be
needed.
In sum, in a critical comparison, the single tailored
intervention without the SHG had no surplus value com-
pared with a nontailored look-alike intervention. The addi-
tion of an SHG to a tailored intervention was especially
useful in highly dependent smokers. Multiple tailoring was
clearly more effective than single tailoring.
The present study has its limitations. First, the follow-up
time frame was only 4 months. It cannot be ruled out that, for
example, the addition of an SHG might be effective in the
long run. Second, we do not know how the present sample of
mostly immotives compares with other samples with low
motivation to quit, as reported by Velicer et al. (1995) and
Dijkstra, De Vries, and Roijackers (1996). Consequently, the
generalizability of the present results remains unclear. Third,
smoking cessation outcomes and the program evaluation
were measured at one time point. Hence, the program
evaluation might be influenced by changes in intention and
behavior. Finally, the present study was designed to test
whether certain tailored interventions are more effective
than other interventions. In the development of tailored
interventions, this kind of research has to be supplemented
with studies that try to unravel why some tailored interven-

tions are more effective than others. Furthermore, future
research should further address the question of for whom
certain tailored interventions are more effective.
