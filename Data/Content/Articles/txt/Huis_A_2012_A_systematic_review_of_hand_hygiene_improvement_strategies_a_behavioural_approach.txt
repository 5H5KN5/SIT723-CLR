Abstract
Background: Many strategies have been designed and evaluated to address the problem of low hand hygiene
(HH) compliance. Which of these strategies are most effective and how they work is still unclear. Here we describe
frequently used improvement strategies and related determinants of behaviour change that prompt good HH
behaviour to provide a better overview of the choice and content of such strategies.
Methods: Systematic searches of experimental and quasi-experimental research on HH improvement strategies
were conducted in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases from January 2000 to November 2009. First,
we extracted the study characteristics using the EPOC Data Collection Checklist, including study objectives, setting,
study design, target population, outcome measures, description of the intervention, analysis, and results. Second,
we used the Taxonomy of Behavioural Change Techniques to identify targeted determinants.
Results: We reviewed 41 studies. The most frequently addressed determinants were knowledge, awareness, action
control, and facilitation of behaviour. Fewer studies addressed social influence, attitude, self-efficacy, and intention.
Thirteen studies used a controlled design to measure the effects of HH improvement strategies on HH behaviour.
The effectiveness of the strategies varied substantially, but most controlled studies showed positive results. The
median effect size of these strategies increased from 17.6 (relative difference) addressing one determinant to 49.5
for the studies that addressed five determinants.
Conclusions: By focussing on determinants of behaviour change, we found hidden and valuable components in
HH improvement strategies. Addressing only determinants such as knowledge, awareness, action control, and
facilitation is not enough to change HH behaviour. Addressing combinations of different determinants showed
better results. This indicates that we should be more creative in the application of alternative improvement
activities addressing determinants such as social influence, attitude, self-efficacy, or intention.

Background
Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) burden patients,
complicate treatment, prolong hospital stay, increase
costs and can be life threatening [1]. Recent studies in
Europe have shown that HAIs affect 4.6% to 9.3% of the
hospitalised patients [2-8]. In Europe, the estimated five
million HAIs that occur annually have an assumed at-
tributable mortality of 50,000 to 135,000 at a cost of €13
to€24 billion [9]. In the United States, prevalence rates
were estimated at 4.5% for 99,000 cases of excessmortality and an economic burden of US $6.5 billion in
2004 [10,11].
Adequate hand hygiene (HH) among hospital personnel
could prevent an estimated 15% to 30% of the HAIs
[12,13]. Numerous studies over the last few decades have
shown that HH compliance rates are generally less than
50% of all the opportunities [14-16]. Many strategies have
been designed and evaluated to address the problem of
low compliance, but most of the effects are small to mod-
erate and often short term [12-17]. This stresses the im-
portance of a clear evidence-based strategy to improve
HH routines [18,19].
In 2001, Naikoba and Hayward systematically reviewed
21 studies, all aimed at improving the HH of healthcare* Correspondence: a.huis@iq.umcn.nl

workers (HCWs) [20]. The authors concluded that
multifaceted strategies are generally more effective than
single strategies. Moreover, strategies directed at educat-ing and motivating HCWs, such as written educational
materials, reminders, and continuous feedback about
performance, were found to be more useful than strat-egies aimed at offering more facilities such as automated
sinks or moisturised soaps. Despite the importance of
this review, Naikoba and Hayward ’s concluded that most
of the reviewed studies had multiple design limitations,
which made causal inferences about the effects of strat-
egies problematic. Gould et al. also recognised methodo-
logical weaknesses of HH studies in their systematic
review [21]. However, they conducted a Cochrane review
with such stringent criteria that only four studies wereincluded, and many possibly relevant non-randomised
trials were disregarded. Therefore, the results of their re-
view provide little guidance to policymakers and hospitalstaff for designing effective programmes to improve HH
adherence. Thus, although high methodological quality
is important, reviewers should balance this with the ur-gency of offering guidance/potential solutions to the
field. An update of the literature, balancing methodo-
logical quality and the need for evidence, seems war-ranted. In order to identify effective routes to promoting
HH and thereby reduce HAIs, it is important to search
the content of improvement strategies that is correlatedwith improved HH behaviour across studies. In imple-
mentation research, the most used classification of strat-
egies is captured in the Data Collection Checklist of theEffective Practice Organisation of Care Group (EPOC),
which is based on the form of performed improvement
activities [22]. A disadvantage of ‘just’coding improve-
ment activities as the EPOC describes, is that informa-
tion about the corresponding triggers that prompt HH
behaviour is disregarded. Improving HH compliance im-plies behaviour change; therefore, application of know-
ledge from the behavioural and social sciences appears
valuable [23-25]. An alternative way of classifying strat-egies is on the basis of their determinants of behaviour
change (Table 1). These determinants are derived from
behaviour and behaviour-change theories and describe
the way or trigger to arrive at behaviour change [26-29].
This behavioural approach might shed new light on thenature of improvement strategies and elucidating how
these strategies work. For example, regularly displaying
charts of HH performance on group levels or informa-tion about nosocomial infection rates can be considered
‘feedback. ’Reviewing the individual HH compliance and
promoting a comparison of HH compliance among teammembers can also be categorised as ‘feedback. ’However,
in the first example, the determinant of behaviour
change is ‘raising awareness, ’while the determinant in
the second example is ‘social influence. ’Both examplesthus target different determinants of behaviour change,
but both would be categorised as ‘feedback ’in the EPOC
classification system.
Theoretically, the application of a chosen behaviour
change activity as part of the HH improvement strategy
(e.g., a meeting to educate staff on the World Health
Organization five moments for HH) will alter a specific
behavioural determinant (in this case, their knowledge on
the five moments for HH), which in turn will changebehaviours (in this case, HH behaviour in line with the five
moments for HH) [26]. We hypothesise that a HH im-
provement strategy targeting more different determinantsof behaviour change will be more effective in increasing
HH compliance than a HH improvement strategy target-
ing less different determinants of behaviour change.
The purpose of the present study is to offer sufficient
conceptual clarity on the nature of HH improvement
strategies by classifying their improvement activities onthe basis of their determinants of behaviour change. In
addition, we used the controlled studies of our review to
explore the effectiveness of targeting different determi-nants of behaviour change.
Methods
Search strategy
First, we selected the 21 studies that Naikoba andHayward reviewed [20]. Second, we searched the data-bases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database ofAbstract of Reviews of Effects (DARE) from January 2000
up to November 2009, as well as the Current Controlled
Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, National Health Service Centrefor Reviews and Dissemination (NHS-CRD): National
Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-
EED), and National Health Service Centre for Reviewsand Dissemination Health Technology Assessment (NHS-
CRD: HTA). The search was limited to studies of human
beings, but no language restrictions were imposed. Thesearch terms included the methodological filters of the
EPOC combined with selected MeSH terms (handwash-
ing) and free text terms (hand washing and hand hygiene)
as used by Naikoba and Hayward [20]. The search strat-
egies used are outlined in Additional file 1.
Selection criteria
Studies had to include at least one outcome comparisonwith a randomised or nonrandomised comparison group,
or a comparison with baseline data in the case of a single
group before-and-after test design. Other criteria were:
1. Population: HCWs in hospital settings
2. Intervention: strategies aimed at improving HH
behaviourHuis et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:92 Page 2 of 14
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/92
3. Comparison: HH behaviour before the introduction
of the programme or strategy, or HH behaviour in acomparison group where another programme or no
programme (usual care) was implemented
4. Outcome: all operationalisations of HH behaviour of
HCWs.
Selection of articles
Two reviewers (AH and TvA) independently reviewedthe titles and abstracts of citations generated by the
search to assess their eligibility for further review based
on the selection criteria, and chose relevant articles forpossible inclusion. Differences in selection were resolved
by consensus or consultation with a third reviewer (MH
or LS) in cases of doubt. From potentially eligible stud-ies, the full text papers were subjected to the same
evaluation strategy.
Quality assessment
Rather than exclude studies deemed a priori to be of
poor quality, we chose to include such studies and em-
pirically rate the level of quality. We used a rating sys-tem adapted from Anderson and Sharpe [30], who
evaluated the impact of various types of interventions on
behaviour change directed either at patients or HCWs.(see Table 2).
Two reviewers (AH and TvA) independently deter-
mined whether studies met the criteria set for methodo-logical quality, and disagreements were again resolved by
discussion. Studies with less than three out of seven
points were removed. Studies that rated three points butfailed to have a positive score for ‘instruments used ’
were removed. Studies that rated three (with a positive
score for ‘instruments used ’) to five points were gradedas moderate quality, and those with six or seven points
were graded as high-quality studies.
Data extraction and synthesis
We used a two-step approach to examine the studies.First, we extracted the study characteristics using theTable 1 Explanation of terms

EPOC Data Collection Checklist that includes study
objectives, setting, study design, target population, out-
come measures, description of the intervention, analysis,and results [31]. Second, to determine which improve-
ment activities could be considered as behavioural change
techniques targeting important determinants of adherencebehaviours, we used a pre-structured form including the
taxonomy of behavioural change techniques of De Bruin
et al. [26]. Although the taxonomy has been primarily ap-
plied in health promotion research, we consider this tax-
onomy as a valuable tool for in-depth evaluation of HH
improvement strategies because these strategies are alsoaimed at changing behaviour of HCWs. The taxonomy
used is an adapted version of the 26-item taxonomy devel-
oped by Abraham and Michie [27]. Whereas the originaltaxonomy already provides a list of well-defined techni-
ques for behaviour change, it was further developed and
adapted by De Bruin and colleagues who categorised thebehaviour change techniques according to the determi-
nants of behaviour they address. The taxonomy thus pro-
vides nine categories to distinguish between techniquesaddressing knowledge, awareness, social influence, atti-
tude, self-efficacy, intention, action control, maintenance,
and facilitation. These determinants are derived from anintegration of theoretical constructs from prevailing be-
haviour (change) theories that have been found predictive
of a range of different health behaviours [28]. Together,the nine categories of determinants include a total of 38
behaviour change techniques. See Table 3 for a selection
of the most relevant techniques with this overview.
All reviewers participated in a four-hour training on
identifying and coding behavioural techniques in line
with the taxonomy. A coding manual (Additional file 2)guided the training. This manual contained comprehen-
sive and detailed criteria for assessing the behaviour
change techniques and their related determinants. Thesecriteria and any ambiguities were discussed during the
training. Then, we performed a pilot using three
excluded studies to validate our scoring results. Finally,two pairs of reviewers (AH and TvA or LS and MH)
used the taxonomy to independently code the complete
range of improvement activities in the included studies
into behaviour change techniques. The techniques iden-
tified were grouped under their related determinant. Thesame procedure was also applied to code ‘usual ’or
‘standard ’care provided to control groups The reviewers
who coded the strategy were blinded for the studyresults, and vice versa. Differences in coding ( i.e., <5%)
were resolved through discussion. See Additional file 3
for a worked example of data extraction and coding.
Data analysis
Given the heterogeneity of the studies with regard to tar-get groups, content and delivery of strategies, andopportunities/moments for HH, no formal meta-analysis
was done. We describe frequently used strategies at the
level of the nine categories of determinants within theclassification of the Taxonomy of Behavioural Change
Techniques by reporting the frequency with which the
determinants were addressed across all studies includedin this review.
We analysed the effectiveness at the level of the nine
categories of determinants and compared studies addres-sing one or more determinants. To obtain methodo-
logical soundness, we only make inferences about
effectiveness using data of the controlled studies ( i.e.,
randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after
studies, and studies with a cross-over design).
The overall effect size was determined by calculating
the relative difference between the intervention and con-
trol groups in each controlled study. This relative differ-
ence represents the ratio of difference (in percentages)between the interventional and control groups. We
obtained the value by dividing the difference between
the post-intervention performance scores from the inter-ventional and control groups by the post-performance
test scores of the control group, multiplied by 100 (see
Additional file 4). To combine findings across studies,we computed the median effect size and the range,
representing the results of strategies related to determi-
nants. We decided to report the median because it is lesssensitive to extreme scores and provides a better esti-
mate of what the ‘average ’is. Most of the studies
included in this review evaluated short-term effects, sowe only report results derived from measurements made
directly after the interventions were completed.
Results
Our search of published works from 2000 through 2009
resulted in 1949 hits for all the databases. A total of 119studies met the inclusion criteria, including the 21 stud-
ies that Naikoba and Hayward reviewed. We assessed
the full text of 115 studies (the full text of four studiescould not be retrieved). Twenty-six studies were
excluded, mostly because of the absence of HH compli-
ance outcomes or studies were non-interventional. Inthe initial review, 89 studies appeared potentially eligible
for review and were read in detail. After quality assess-
ment, 41 studies were included for analysis, and 48 stud-ies were excluded due to major quality limitations,
including 10 studies previously reviewed by Naikoba and
Hayward (Figure 1). See Additional file 5 for characteris-tics of excluded studies.
Study characteristics
Additional file 6 provides an overview of study charac-
teristics in the 41 studies reviewed. Naikoba and
Hayward had previously reviewed 11 studies that wereHuis et al. Implementation Science 2012, 7:92 Page 4 of 14
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/7/1/92
published from 1986 through 1999, and the remaining
30 studies were published from 2000 through 2009.
Twenty-eight studies had a before-after test design,seven had a controlled before-after design, three were
randomised controlled trials, and three had a cross-over
design. The study settings were predominantly intensivecare units (n = 25), followed by medical or surgical wards
(n = 10), emergency wards (n = 4), and 2 studies covered
all hospital wards. Multicentre trials were conducted inthree studies (two to four hospitals) and the number of
participating wards varied from one to three per hos-
pital. In 28 studies, the target population was specifiedas nurses, physicians, and other HCWs. Six studies tar-
geted only nurses, while seven studies did not specify
the type of HCW. The unit of analysis was defined asHH opportunities or moments for HH (n = 33), partici-
pants (n = 5), patients (n = 1) and number of dispenser
activations (n = 2). Most studies (n = 39) reported HHcompliance rates as a primary outcome measure. These
data were collected by means of unobtrusive observa-
tions (n = 30) or by obtrusive observations (n = 9) inHCWs. One study measured HH performance by vol-
ume of soap and hand alcohol used, and one study iden-
tified HH episodes by using an electronic countingdevice. Six studies based their strategy on barriers identi-
fied by practice research such as skin irritation, work-
load, staff personal habits, and priorities. Eleven studiesmentioned barriers derived from the literature. The rat-
ing of study quality resulted in six high-quality studies.
Each of these studies scored six points on our ratingTable 3 Selection* of the most relevant techniques and their determinant with this overview

scale. Two of the moderate-quality studies scored three
points, 28 studies scored four points, and five studies
scored five points. Identified quality limitations were:
uncontrolled study design (n = 28), absence of samplesize justification (n = 33), observations without a descrip-
tion of inter-rater reliability agreement (n = 31), and no
description of test statistics (n = 3).
Determinants addressed (n = 41)
We evaluated the HH improvement strategies across thecontrolled and uncontrolled studies Figure 2 shows the
number of studies addressing specific determinants.
The most frequently addressed determinants were know-ledge (n = 29), awareness (n = 26), action control (n = 26),
and facilitation of behaviour (n = 23). Fewer studies
addressed social influence (n = 11), attitude (n = 10), self-efficacy (n = 10), and intention (n = 4). One determinant
directed at behavioural maintenance following behaviour
change was not addressed at all. Five studies used tech-niques focused mainly on gaining senior management
support and commitment, and institutional priority for
HH [32-36]. These activities could not be coded becausethey were primarily directed at gaining support for pro-
gram implementation rather than serving as a technique
to change HH behaviour directly.The 14 studies that addressed one or two determinants
mainly consisted of combinations of knowledge, aware-
ness, action control, and facilitation of behaviour
(Table 4). Only one study in this group added social in-fluence to its strategy [37]. Moongtui combined social
influence with awareness. Colleagues evaluated each
other ’s performance on appropriate hand washing and
glove wearing. The investigators also provided feedback
at group level by posting compliance scores anonym-
ously on a bulletin board every three days.
Fourteen studies addressed three or four determinants
and used combinations as described above, but seven
studies also addressed determinants as social influence,
attitude, self-efficacy, or intention. For example, Huang
focussed on increasing knowledge (educational trainingprogramme and written information) and awareness
(clarifying risks for blood pathogen exposure), but also
enhanced the self-efficacy of nurses with one hour ofpractical demonstration of hand washing and using
gloves [55]. In Marra ’s study, activities were also aimed
at increasing awareness by providing feedback on infec-tion rates. The nurse manager also provided opportun-
ities for social comparison by showing each HCW the
total number of times the dispensers were used in eachpatient room in which the HCW worked compared toRecords identified through

the number of times that other HCWs used dispensers.
In addition, the nurse manager explained the goals and
targets of the HH improvement strategy twice a week,
thus strengthening intention and self-efficacy [63].
All 13 studies addressing five or more determinants
consisted of activities addressing multiple different
determinants. For example, Trick et al. addressed deter-
minants such as knowledge (educational sessions and
distribution of educational materials to professionals),
awareness (displaying HH adherence), action control
(hospital-wide poster campaign), facilities (alcohol-based
hand rub), and attitude (pointing out the benefits of
using alcohol-based hand rubs) [67].
We found no differences in the extent to which deter-
minants were targeted between the controlled studies
and uncontrolled studies (Table 4).
See Additional file 7 for details of improvement activ-
ities and results in the 41 studies reviewed.
Effectiveness
Table 5 presents the effectiveness of the controlled studies
related to their determinants of behaviour change. Con-
trolled studies addressing one determinant focussed on
action control (n = 1), awareness (n = 1) or facilitation of
behaviour (n = 1). The median effect for these strategies
was a relative difference (improvement) of 17.6 in per-
formance. The effect size from one controlled study
addressing two determinants was 25.7. The relative differ-
ence increased from 42.3 in the three studies addressing
three determinants to 43.9 for the two studies addressing
four determinants. The relative difference was 49.5 for the
three studies that addressed five determinants.
No controlled study addressed six determinants. The
only controlled study addressing seven determinantsshowed less impact on short-term effectiveness (relative
difference 9.7). However, baseline HH rates in this study
were higher in the intervention group than in the control
group, probably because administrators were already plan-
ning and discussing the strategy during the baseline
phase [70].
The increase in effectiveness correlated closely with the
number of determinants (one to five) addressed (Pearson ’s
correlation coefficient = 0.961, p = 0.009) See Figure 3.
Discussion
Improved HH behaviours among hospital personnel
could have a considerable impact on HAIs, healthcare
costs, and patients ’health and quality of life. Yet,
reviews with detailed examination of the active content
of strategies to promote HH are missing. In the present
study, the content and effectiveness of a range of strat-
egies to improve the HH adherence of HCWs were stud-
ied. By using a detailed coding taxonomy of behaviour
change techniques targeting major behavioural determi-
nants, we were able to obtain a detailed insight into fre-
quently used HH improvement strategies and how they
work. Analysing the content of the strategies at the level
of determinants that prompt HH behaviour, it was found
that those studies focusing on combinations of different
determinants gave better results, which indicates that we
should be more creative in the application of alternative
improvement activities aimed at altering specific behav-
ioural determinants change, such as social influence, at-
titude, self-efficacy, and intention.
Although the content of the strategies and related deter-
minants varied greatly, most of the studies addressed
more than one determinant (mainly knowledge, aware-
ness, action control, and facilitation of behaviour). This is

consistent with Naikoba and Hayward ’s findings and pre-
vious systematic reviews of changing professional behav-
iour in which education (addressing ‘knowledge ’),
feedback (addressing ‘awareness ’), reminders (addressing
‘action control ’), and facilities (addressing ‘facilitation of
behaviour ’) were the most frequently used improvement
activities [12,20,21]. Twenty strategies addressed add-itional determinants that prompt HH behaviour such as
social influence, attitude, self-efficacy, or intention. These
specific determinants were especially targeted in compre-hensive strategies that addressed at least four determi-
nants. This provides new insight into the content of HH
improvement strategies: half of the studies used a strategytargeting determinants not mentioned in previous reviews
of HH adherence.
Most studies addressed determinants at the individual
and institutional levels; specific team-oriented activities
were hardly identified. Strategies including team-
directed activities could, however, be valuable becauseHCWs (especially nurses) usually work in teams. Evi-
dence for the effectiveness of team-directed strategies in
other settings exists, but these strategies are rarely ap-plied in studies of HH improvement [72,73]. Surpris-
ingly, activities directed at behavioural maintenance
following behaviour change were not identified in thestudies. Nonetheless, activities aimed at persistence
should be part of the strategy for achieving sustainability
of improved HH behaviour.
The effectiveness of the strategies varied substantially,
but most controlled studies showed positive results. This
is in line with previous review findings [74,75]. If deter-minants such as social influence, attitude, self-efficacy,
and intention are targeted within a strategy, the effect is
larger than that of strategies consisting solely of a com-bination of determinants, such as knowledge, awareness,
action control, and facilities. Apparently, these specific
determinants provide an additional contribution to ef-fectiveness. This finding is confirmed by results of previ-
ous studies where social influence, attitude, self-efficacy,
and intention are considered relevant to successfullychanging behaviour [26-29].
The median effect size increased when more determi-
nants were addressed. In other words, there seems to bea dose response effect. This result deviates from
Grimshaw et al. ’s finding that there was no dose response
relation between the number of improvement activitiesTable 4 Content of strategies related to determinants of

and the effects of multifaceted strategies [75]. The lack of
a rationale in the composition of a multifaceted strategy,
such as mentioned by Grimshaw, may be a good explan-
ation for the lack of a relationship between the number of
improvement activities and the effect. An additional ex-
planation for this discrepancy can be found in the frame-
work chosen to classify the strategies for change.
Grimshaw used the EPOC classification of strategies that
is based on the form of performed improvement activities.
We used an alternative approach that classed improve-
ment activities on the basis of their determinants of be-
haviour change. By using the Taxonomy of Behavioural
Change Techniques we collected information about trig-
gers that encourage behaviour change rather than describ-
ing separate improvement activities. Thus, using multiple
activities is not necessarily the same as addressing mul-
tiple determinants or vice versa. For example, the com-
bined distribution of educational materials and provision
of educational sessions constitute two different improve-
ment activities. We would not label this strategy as multi-
faceted because both activities apply the same
determinant ( ‘knowledge ’).
Although we found a maximum effect in addressing
five determinants, we cannot provide a ‘one-size-fits-all ’
recipe for building a successful strategy. Previous recom-
mendations from the literature have pointed out that an
improvement strategy for HH behaviour should address
existing problems and barriers [12,73,75]. Analyses of
barriers and facilitators and linking improvement activ-
ities to these influencing factors are important steps in
the design of a strategy and may be crucial to success. A
multifaceted strategy with many improvement activitiesthat are not precisely tuned to the existing barriers ap-
parently misses the target; part of the components may
be redundant or ineffective. For example, if there is no
knowledge shortage, educational strategy components
probably will not contribute to the effectiveness of the
multifaceted strategy. Barriers also exits at other levels
than the individual HCW. Barriers like negative role
models, a poor social culture, and disinterested manage-
ment can hamper good HH. Overcoming these barriers
requires the use of alternative activities such as social in-
fluence, attitude, self-efficacy, or intention. Of particular
interest is the HELPING HANDS study, currently per-
formed in the Netherlands [76]. In this study, improve-
ment activities are directed at gaining active
commitment and initiative of ward management; model-
ling by informal leaders at the ward; and setting norms
and targets within the team. This team-directed strategy
goes beyond individual and institutional only
approaches, but rather addresses determinants at team
level by focussing on social influence in groups and
strengthening leadership.
In this review, it was not possible to check for this ‘ap-
propriateness ’of determinants addressed within the
studies because context and barrier analysis and the ra-
tionale regarding strategy selection were hardly reported.
Therefore, for most of the studies, it was unclear how
well the strategy fitted the context. In view of the effect-
iveness, but also feasibility and costs, we propose select-
ing appropriate determinants rather than addressing all
determinants.
We concentrated on determinants within strategies —
an alternate view, yet crucial to understanding the

working mechanism of strategies to improve HH adher-
ence. We were able to identify less commonly addressed
determinants, such as social influence, attitude, self-efficacy, and intention, that considerably contribute to
the effectiveness of strategies. Our study findings fit well
within the implementation model of Grol and Wensing[73] for building a successful HH improvement strategy
(see Figure 4).
The Taxonomy of Behavioural Change Techniques was
a valuable tool that led us to convert descriptions of im-
provement activities into well-defined determinants. Weobtained a clear focus on theory-based determinants of
behaviour change that were hidden in the improvement
strategies. We consider this a crucial step in developinga theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of im-
provement strategies.
Methodological discussion
Although we succeeded in achieving substantial insight
into the content and effectiveness of HH improvementstrategies, some aspects should be considered further.
First, the methodological weakness of the studies is still
a major concern. Most of the studies were small scale;they lacked a control group comparable to the test
group, and made no formal attempt to minimise bias.
There is a risk that a positive relationship between thenumber of determinants targeted and the effect on HH
compliance might be partly explained by an unknown
confounder. This holds particularly true for the observa-tional studies where wards were selected to receive an
improvement strategy. In our review, we included stud-
ies that clearly described the content of the strategy andwere at least of moderate quality. With methodological
soundness in mind, we only used results from controlled
studies when we reported effectiveness. However, therisk of confounding should be taken into account when
interpreting our results. Methodologically robust re-
search is still required to evaluate the effectiveness ofinterventions intended to improve HH compliance. Ad-
equately powered cluster randomised trials or well-
designed ITS studies would provide the optimal studydesign.
Second, our search included literature up to November
2009. Therefore, we cannot provide information on re-cently performed HH improvement studies The screen-
ing and analysis of the search results as reported in this
review served as a starting point for the development oftwo HH improvement strategies, which were subse-
quently tested in a randomised controlled trial. The de-
sign of this study was published in 2011 [76].
Third, as in any systematic review of the literature,
there may be publication bias. Most studies showed
positive results; it is possible that studies with negativeresults have not been published. In our review we were
unable to retrieve four articles; it is possible that they
contained relevant data.
Fourth, the criteria used to determine when HH
should be performed varied over the studies and were
not always explicitly stated. This may have implicationsfor the generalisability of the results of the studies.
Fifth, good reliability in coding the improvement activ-
ities was observed (>95%), suggesting that our instruc-tions and definitions can be applied reliably after only
brief training. Within all steps of the review process, val-
idity was increased by using standardised methods andStep 1  Description of good hand hygiëne

forms as well as multiple raters. However, once techni-
ques and targeted determinants are well chosen, examin-
ing the actual exposure to the improvement activitieswas problematic. Studies did not or marginally report on
how well the improvement strategy was implemented.
Designating HH as hospital goal, for example, requiressetting specific, realistic, and measurable targets [77].
However, descriptions of the improvement activities in
the studies provide insufficient detail to check for appro-priate delivery as well as the actual exposure of the
HCWs to this activity. Without sufficient information
about implementation fidelity, it is hard to determinewhether the impact of the HH improvement strategy is
due to the implementation process or to the compos-
ition of the strategy itself, a so-called Type III error [78].
Finally, most studies did not describe, or only margin-
ally described, the activities of the ‘usual ’or‘standard ’
care provided to control groups. Standard care practicesmay vary from site to site. Therefore, describing stand-
ard care is important for the interpretation and compari-
son of intervention effects. Given the combination ofstrengths and considerations, this review provides an
original and valuable overview of various strategies for
improving the HH adherence of HCWs.
Conclusions and future directions
By focussing on determinants of behaviour change, we
found hidden and valuable components in HH improve-
ment strategies. Addressing only determinants such asknowledge, awareness, action control, and facilitation is
not enough to change HH behaviour. Addressing combi-
nations of different determinants provided better results.This indicates that we should be more creative in the ap-
plication of alternative activities addressing determinants
such as social influence, attitude, self-efficacy, orintention.
A systematically designed strategy that targets various
problems and barriers to change, with activities at differ-ent levels (professional, team, and organisation), is
needed to achieve changes in HH behaviour. Currently,
most strategies focus on the individual and the organisa-tion, while group- or team-directed strategies are rarely
used. Including team-directed techniques in a strategy is
a promising development.
