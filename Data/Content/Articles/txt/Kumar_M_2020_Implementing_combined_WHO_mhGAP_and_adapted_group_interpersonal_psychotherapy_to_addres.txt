Abstract
Background: Addressing adolescent pregnancies associated health burden demands new ways of organizing
maternal and child mental health services to meet multiple needs of this group. There is a need to strengthen
integration of sustainable evidence-based mental health interventions in primary health care settings for pregnant
adolescents. The proposed study is guided by implementation science frameworks with key objective of
implementing a pilot trial testing a full IPT-G version along with IPT-G mini version under the mhGAP/IPT-G service
framework and to study feasibility of the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G adolescent peripartum depression care delivery
model and estimate if a low cost and compressed version of IPT-G intervention would result in similar size of effect
on mental health and family functioning as the Full IPT-G. There are two sub- studies embedded which are: 1) To
identify multi-level system implementation barriers and strategies guided by the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR) to enhance perinatal mhGAP-depression care and evidence-based intervention
integration (i.e., group interpersonal psychotherapy; IPT-G) for pregnant adolescents in primary care contexts; 2) To
use findings from aim 1 and observational data from Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinics that run within
primary health care facilities to develop a mental health implementation workflow plan that has buy-in from key

stakeholders, as well as to develop a modified protocol and implementation training manual for building health
facility staff ’s capacity in implementing the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G depression care.
Methods: For the primary objective of studying feasibility of the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G depression care in MCH
service context for adolescent perinatal depression, we will recruit 90 pregnant adolescents to a three-arm pilot
intervention (unmasked) trial study (IPT-G Full, IPT-G Mini, and wait-list control in the context of mhGAP care).
Pregnant adolescents ages 13 –18, in their 1st-2nd trimester with a depression score of 13 and above on EPDS
would be recruited. Proctor ’s implementation evaluation model will be used. Feasibility and acceptability of the
intervention implementation and size of effects on mental health and family functioning will be estimated using
mixed method data collection from caregivers of adolescents, adolescents, and health care providers. In the two
sub-studies, stakeholders representing diverse perspectives will be recruited and focus group discussions data will
be gathered. For aim 2, to build capacity for mhGAP-approach of adolescent depression care and research, the
implementation-capacity training manual will be applied to train 20 providers, 12 IPT-G implementers/health
workers and 16 Kenyan researchers. Acceptability and appropriateness of the training approach will be assessed.
Additional feedback related to co-located service delivery model, task-shifting and task-sharing approach of IPT-G
delivery will be gathered for further manual improvement.
Discussion: This intervention and service design are in line with policy priority of Government of Kenya, Kenya
Vision 2030, World Health Organization, and UN Sustainable Development Goals that focus on improving capacity
of mental health service systems to reduce maternal, child, adolescent health and mental health disparities in
LMICs. Successfully carrying out this study in Kenya will provide an evidence-based intervention service
development and implementation model for adolescents in other Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The study is
funded by FIC/NIH under K43 grant.

Background
Globally depression is the leading cause of disease bur-
den in women of reproductive age. Maternal depression
occurs in women during both antenatal and postnatal
periods. The prevalence of depression is high among
pregnant women, with worldwide estimates of 11% to
18% [ 1,2] and is estimated to be between 15% to 28% in
Lower- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) [ 3].
Studies in Kenya and neighboring countries have found
that younger women (aged 18 –24 years) experience
greater psychological vulnerabilities [ 4] and depression
in this group ranges from 8.3% to 39% [ 5–7] with high
risk populations like adolescent mothers and gender-
based violence impacted women [ 8]. Young women in
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lose around 10.4 disability ad-
justed life years due to depression during pregnancy.
Women who experience antepartum depression often
continue to experience depressive symptoms into the
postpartum period, with more than 54% of those with
postpartum depression reporting depressive episodes be-
fore or during pregnancy [ 9]. Pregnant women between
ages 18 –21 years are at high risk for depression in coun-
tries like Kenya because circumstances that lead to their
pregnancy often include low socioeconomic status and
food insecurity [ 10], with subsequent increases in unpro-
tected sex with older men in an effort to seek financial
support through sexual favors. These economic factorsalso contribute to early motherhood, gender-based vio-
lence, low educational attainment and social stigma, all
of which are associated with higher prevalence of de-
pression [ 8,11–16]. These vulnerable young women
need health care and psychosocial support in building
resilience against challenging barriers and risk factors.
Consistent with the World Health Organization
(WHO) recommendations for LMICs, we propose Inter-
personal Psychotherapy (IPT), an evidence-based depres-
sion treatment with demonstrated clinical efficacy in
East African regions of Kenya and Uganda, for young
women ’s depression during pregnancy [ 17,18]. IPT has
demonstrated high efficacy when delivered by a readily
available workforce of local, non-specialist personnel in
East Africa [ 17,19–22]. Based on recent studies utilizing
IPT-G in Kenya [ 18,23], we believe that IPT ’s focus on
social support, rebuilding interpersonal relationships by
bolstering interpersonal communications skills, and fo-
cusing on life-transitions make it a promising fit with
the mental health care needs of pregnant adolescents.
However, pregnant adolescents in Kenya experience a
particular set of stressors which we believe will require
adaptation of standard IPT in order to match this par-
ticular population ’s needs. For example, pregnant adoles-
cents and adolescent mothers in Kenya are often unable
to complete education as planned with related short-
comings in earning potential and are susceptible toKumar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:136 Page 2 of 18
exploitation and abuse by their biological families and
community in general. While IPT is well-equipped to
address most of these issues, some adaptations are ne-
cessary to address specific role transitions, adverse life
circumstances and losses faced by young pregnant ado-
lescents and women in Kenya.
Adolescent pregnancies and unmet adolescent needs in
Kenya
Adolescents make up nearly 16% of the world ’s popula-
tion, and the proportion is greater in Sub-Saharan Africa
(23% of the regional population) [ 24]. Over 16 million
adolescent girls worldwide give birth between ages 15 –
19, and the vast majority of these births (95%) occur in
LMICs [ 25]. When adolescent girls become mothers,
their opportunities for economic and educational growth
are compromised. A burgeoning number of adolescent
mothers from LMICs are marginalized due to poverty,
gender-based traditions or geographical resource scarcity
which further limit their access to health resources, in-
formation, social protection, and personal development
[1,10,26–29]. Structural inequalities and adverse cir-
cumstances have detrimental impact on adolescent
mothers ’mental health and this sets the stage for ad-
verse medical conditions, risky behaviors, and mental ill-
ness in adulthood [ 27,30]. Estimated prevalence of
depression during perinatal period is 11% to 18% world-
wide and between 30% to 50% in LMICs [ 1,31–33]. The
risk for perinatal depression in adolescents is 2 to 9
times higher than adults [ 2,31,33–35]. Despite the
enormous mental health needs for adolescent mothers
in LMICs, perinatal mental health research has focused
on adults and has not considered the unique challenges
that adolescent mothers are facing. Most research has
also not invested in public health strategies or culturally
relevant strategies to empower adolescents and address
the mental health resource and service gaps for this
population in LMIC settings.
Global mental health service strategies and agenda for
addressing needs in LMIC settings
WHO proposed two comprehensive frameworks for sup-
porting efforts to establish and scale-up mental health
services in LMICs. The Comprehensive Mental Health
Action Plan (MHAP) 2013 –2020 (or the Action Plan)
[34] proposes system strengthening in 4 areas to im-
prove population mental health: i) developing effective
leadership and governance, ii) providing comprehensive,
integrated, and responsive mental health services, iii)
implementing strategies for promoting mental health,
and iv) strengthening evidence and research for mental
health. The Mental Health Gap Action Programme
(mhGAP) [ 35,36] focuses on ii) and iii) of the MHAP
and further provides evidence-based guidelines and toolsto support service system setup, delivery, and provision
of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for common
mental health disorders in health care settings with lim-
ited specialty [ 37]. MHAP is a World Health Assembly
approved policy document while mhGAP Intervention
Guidelines (mhGAP-IG) are evidence-based guidelines
and supportive technical material. mhGAP material
helps member states to achieve the objectives of MHAP.
Specifically, mhGAP recommends applications of collab-
orative, task-shifting, and task-sharing implementation
strategies (i.e., considering collaboration between mental
health specialists and non-specialist health-care pro-
viders and redistribution of clinical tasks from mental
health specialists to non-specialized providers) in
provision of mental health services. The mhGAP-IG also
provides assessment, management clinical decision-
making action flowcharts, and recommended EBIs for
treating 8 priority mental health conditions (including
interventions for depression). Although both MHAP and
mhGAP have been applied successfully to address adult
depression and other mental disorders in several LMICs
[20,38,39], application of these frameworks in child and
adolescent mental health service and in Kenyan contexts
remains in infancy. A handful of depression intervention
studies in LMICs that use EBIs recommended in the
mhGAP (e.g., Group interpersonal psychotherapy/IPT-
G, Thinking Healthy Program, Problem Management
Plus) have exclusively either focused on perinatal depres-
sion for a wide range of reproductive-aged women [ 15,
27,40–44] or interventions for depressed adolescents in
non-medical health service settings [ 17,45]. Most stud-
ies have focused on efficacy of EBIs and have not exam-
ined implementation related questions or tested
feasibility of mhGAP-IG for peripartum adolescent men-
tal health. More pragmatic research that simultaneously
considers effective mental health leadership develop-
ment, workforce development strategies, EBI implemen-
tation strategies, and effectiveness outcomes is sorely
needed.
In considering utilizing WHO recommended models
to adolescent perinatal depression in Kenya, several
other system and service level implementation gaps and
adolescent population characteristics need to be consid-
ered. Like other LMICs, Kenya has weak child and ado-
lescent mental health system with limited mental health
professionals and workers [ 17]. In tandem with the glo-
bal agenda, the Kenya Vision 2030 mental health policy
program (developed in 2012) brings in major health sys-
tem reforms aiming at ensuring equity, people centered-
ness and participatory approach, efficiency, multi-
sectoral approach and social accountability in delivery of
mental health services [ 46]. However, progress in actual-
izing these changes in child mental health policy and
service system development remain slow.Kumar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:136 Page 3 of 18
In addition to the systemic gaps, other intervention-
implementation research gaps exist. First, in the current
mhGAP-IG, evidence-based guidelines and tools for adult
depression (including perinatal depression) and child
and adolescent depression are separated , but interven-
tions that integrate both pregnancy and adolescent needs
for adolescent perinatal depression are lacking. The
adult and child/adolescent versions of mhGAP-
depression packages focus on different contents and ap-
proaches. For example, in adult depression, mhGAP-IG
emphasizes on patient ’s individual needs and interven-
tion (i.e., psychoeducation, stress reduction and
strengthening social support, promoting improved func-
tioning in daily activities, brief psychological treatment
for depression, and pharmacology). For adolescent de-
pression, mhGAP-IG considers critical roles of care-
givers, families, and schools/teachers in depression
intervention given adolescents ’developmental needs;
therefore, it recommends that depression intervention
for adolescents must consider both individual and fam-
ily/community related intervention (i.e., consideration of
psychoeducation for the child/adolescent and family,
guidance on promoting wellbeing, caregiver support,
stressors management, community resources linkage,
and collaboration with teachers/schools in managing de-
pression). Although both adult and child/adolescent de-
pression intervention guidelines/tool packages are
relevant to adolescent perinatal depression, how these
packages should be adapted to effectively address Ken-
yan perinatal adolescent needs is yet to be systematically
studied. Another gap is the demand-resource gap , as ma-
ternal and child health (MCH) clinics usually serve high
volume of pregnant adolescents or young mothers (e.g.,
20–30 pregnant adolescents are seen per week [or 960 –
1440 per year] in each MCH clinic in Nairobi, Kenya).
Considering high prevalence of adolescent pregnancy,
high risk for depression in this population, and low re-
source in MCH clinics, utilizing WHO recommended
depression EBIs (e.g., IPT-G), which usually require
more than 5 intervention sessions, may not be practical
in meeting population service demands and needs. Add-
itional cost-effective strategies (such as considering
lower dose implying fewer intervention sessions, using
group instead of individual approach for intervention,
applying low-cost patient/family/community empower-
ment approaches of service provision) would be needed.
In summary, given varied developmental needs and
living context differences (e.g., parent-child co-living,
connection with educational institutions) between adults
and adolescents, more intervention implementation-
effectiveness research for perinatal depression in adoles-
cent population is needed. In addition, given the utility,
comprehensiveness, and potential impacts of mhGAP,
systematically studying the feasibility of integratingmhGAP in routine MCH care for adolescents with peri-
natal depression merits further inquiry. These areas of
research will provide knowledge for providing integrated
intervention (or co-located MCH and mental health ser-
vices) to reduce burden of perinatal depression for ado-
lescents in Kenya and LMIC in general.
Given this background, the purpose of this study is to
identify strategies to improve integration and fit of the
mhGAP-depression intervention model (including IPT-
G) for pregnant adolescents in Kenya; to develop a
Kenyan-adolescent version of WHO recommended
mhGAP/IPT-G intervention program and training man-
ual for intervention implementation and service system
capacity building; and to pilot test feasibility of this inte-
grated mhGAP/IPT-G service delivery model for adoles-
cent prenatal depression (see Fig. 1and Tables 1,2,3).
The adolescent version of mhGAP/IPT-G is yet to be
developed in Kenya. We are proposing a pilot study to
test feasibility of the trial study design and estimate size
of mhGAP/IPT-G intervention effects (Full and Mini
versions) on pregnant adolescents ’mental health and
family functioning.
As a first step, we will bring a group of leaders/stake-
holders from MCHs and communities together to focus
on:
(1) strategies to enhance the fit of mhGAP/IPT-G into
Kenyan pregnant and parenting adolescents ’needs
as well as MCH clinical structure, resources, and
workflow (in addition to the task-shifting/sharing
and collaborative strategies that have been included
as part of the mhGAP);
(2) strategies for designing adolescent version of
mhGAP/IPT-G training manual and effective
capacity building approach to support the
implementation of the integrated mhGAP/IPT-G
service delivery in MCHs.
Conceptual model and design overview
Conceptual model
The adaptation, implementation, and evaluation of the
mhGAP/IPT-G will be guided by an integrated concep-
tual model that combines two dissemination and imple-
mentation (D&I) frameworks. D&I research is a growing
field that informs how evidence-based interventions and
practices can be successfully adopted, implemented, and
maintained in health care delivery and community set-
tings. Its methods and frameworks provide guidance
around building teams, engagement with stakeholders,
maintaining fidelity and adapting tools and interventions
to varied cultural and organizational settings [ 48]. The
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) [48,49], which accounts for five domains of con-
textual factors that may influence key determinants thatKumar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:136 Page 4 of 18
impact implementation and effectiveness outcomes, will
be used to guide implementation and adaptation strategy
development under aims 1 & 2. The five major domains
of the CFIR include the intervention, individuals in-
volved ,the inner (including political, structural, and cul-
tural contexts) and outer (including social, economic,
and political contexts) settings , and the process by which
implementation is accomplished .T h e Conceptual model
of Implementation Outcomes [56], which provides a
framework for guiding implementation, service feasibil-
ity, and effect size/impact estimation, will be applied to
guide the aim 3 outcome estimation. Applying both
multi-domain/level D&I frameworks will result in: (1)
improved strategies to address knowledge gaps toward
adolescent friendly and family-centered adolescent preg-
nancy and mental health care; (2) identification of low-
cost support strategies from health care workers, family
members and community to support the adolescent; (3)
engaged/motivated strategies for adolescents toward
making proactive behavioral and health changes (i.e., for
promoting their reproductive health and wellbeing); (4)
integrated quality MCH services supported by local pro-
viders and policy stakeholders; and (5) evidence foreffective mhGAP/IPT-G implementation and potential
efficacy outcomes.
Design overview and setting of the study
A rigorous mixed methods study will be used to
study strategies to adapt and improve mhGAP-IG and
IPT-G for Kenyan adolescent population and MCH
implementation contexts. The pilot implementation
study will be based at two Nairobi primary health
care centers —Kariobangi North and Kangemi. Kario-
bangi is a low-income residential estate in north east-
ern part of Nairobi, Kenya. Kariobangi consists of
both lower middle class and slum-type dwellings and
is split into two parts: Kariobangi North and Kario-
bangi South. Kariobangi North is located approxi-
mately 15 kms from Nairobi city center. Kariobangi
north is estimated to have 8000 to 10,000 residents.
Kangemi is a slum in Nairobi County located in a
small valley on the outskirts of the city. It is bordered
on the north by the middle-class neighborhoods of
Loresho and Kibagare and Westlands on its west. Dif-
ferent sources report that Kangemi has more than
100,000 residents. The study will be conducted in

Nairobi at the Nairobi County ’s two primary health
care facilities that offer MCH services. The study is
conducted in collaboration among partners from the
University of Nairobi, Ministry of Health (Community
Health Promotion and Mental Health Departments),
WHO non-communicable diseases unit, and UNFPA ’s
adolescent SRH section. After enrolment, adolescents
will be followed through regular clinic visits in the
two respective centers. The study clinic will have ded-
icated staff including clini cal and nursing officers able
to provide clinical care offered as part of routine
Antenatal Clinic (ANC) care for pregnant adolescents.
The assumption is that the pregnant adolescent will
seek the intervention and ANC at the clinic site from
where she was recruited. Th e delivery options might
vary depending on the personal situation, obstetric
history and medical compli cations associated with
pregnancy. However, the participants will be tracked
on the delivery and birth outcomes wherever child-
birth takes place.Kenyatta National Hospital/University of Nairobi eth-
ics review committee has approved the study and add-
itional approvals were sought from Nairobi county
health directorate and National Commission for Science,
Technology and Innovation which will be renewed an-
nually (as per the respective committee policies).
Methodology

feasibility trial and the two sub-studies.
Methodology for primary pilot trial
Considering high prevalence of adolescent pregnancy,
high risk for depression in this population, and low re-
source in MCH clinics, the WHO recommended Full
version of IPT-G may not be practical in meeting popu-
lation service demands and needs. Therefore, we will test
a Mini version of IPT-G in comparing to the FullTable 1 Summary table the pilot feasibility trial

goal is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the in-
tegrated mhGAP-IG/IPT-G service model in the MCH
contexts as well as feasibility of applying RCT design to
study differential impacts of the IPT-G Full and Miniversion in MCHs. Our secondary goal is to estimate the

Study procedure
Figure 1provides an overview of the pilot trial design.
The two MCH clinics that we build capacity in Aim 2
will be the pilot Implementation sites. During the 1st
implementation cycle (about 2 –3 months), we will work
with only 1 MCH clinic (Cohort 1), and then work with
another MCH clinic in the 2nd implementation (Cohort
2). For each cohort, 45 pregnant adolescents with mod-
erate to severe depression will be recruited. As the inter-
ventions will be using self-reported measures and the
adolescent participants would be directly involved the
intervention arms would be unmasked.
Inclusion criteria (for the implementation feasibility and
impact estimate study)

Intervention implementation
Participants will be randomly assigned to IPT-G Full,
IPT-G Mini, and wait-list control using computer ran-
dom generator by research staff ( n= 15 for each arm, 45
per cohort).
/C15The IPT-G Full and Mini groups will receive the
assigned interventions (8 vs. 4 sessions) developed
from Aims 1 and 2 (including a perinatal depression
educational material/handout). To avoid contamin-
ation, intervention for the IPT-G Full and Mini ver-
sions will be carried out by 2 separate
implementation teams (2 –3 facilitators in each team)
follow the assigned manual/protocol. Figure 2pro-
vides intervention contents for the Mini version, in
comparison to the recommended Full version.

referral) and perinatal depression educational
materials for safety concerns. They will receive IPT-
G Mini after the post implementation assessment is
completed.
Feasibility evaluation measures and procedure
To evaluate feasibility of the mhGAP-IG/IPT-G imple-
mentation model in the MCHs, a mixed methods data col-
lection approach will be applied and data will be collected
from multiple sources (i.e., implementers, MCH leaders,
adolescent mothers and their family members) to
minimize data collection bias. As described above, the
Conceptual model of Implementation Outcomes [56]i sa p -
plied to guide the construct selection for the implementa-
tion feasibility and impact estimation. Feasibility of the
mhGAP/IPT-G mental health service delivery model will
be assessed using three indicators: fidelity (i.e., % of ses-
sions is delivered with > 80% of contents), level of engage-
ment (e.g., % reach targeted population, % participating in
intervention sessions), quality of implementation (e.g., ac-
ceptability, appropriateness, usefulness, satisfaction of the
mhGAP/IPT-G service model), and perceived mental
health service (e.g., mental health service quality, MCH
climate). Feasibility of applying a trial design for mhGAP/
IPT-G impact evaluation in MCHs will be assessed usingtwo indicators: % of adolescent-caregiver pairs that are ex-
posed to intervention contents within the assigned condi-
tion; and % of data collection performed as planned.
Impacts/effect size estimation for the IPT-G Full and Mini
versions (the secondary outcomes) will be assessed for ad-
olescents ’mental health and family functioning outcomes.
Both quantitative data and qualitative data will be col-
lected. Qualitative data will be collected through focus
groups (2 groups for each intervention arm) at the end of
implementation cycle. Tables 1and4lists the feasibility
outcomes measures and sources of data collection (under
implementation feasibility, mental health service out-
comes, and trial design feasibility and effect size estima-
tion). Implementation feasibility outcome data, collected
from the MCH staff/intervention implementers and ado-
lescents who participated in the two intervention arms
(IPT-G Full and Mini), will be gathered after each group
session throughout the two implementation periods. For
effect-size estimation, all study participants will complete
a baseline (Time 1) interview (on mental health and family
functioning outcomes) before randomization and inter-
vention implementation, followed by a 1- or 2-month im-
plementation period (2 months for the IPT-G Full and 1
month for the IPT-G Mini). Only when a participant is
physically unwell, or has to terminate due to a pregnancy
related emergency or any other severe mental health issue
will their participant grouping be unblinded and an appro-
priate referral made. They will receive a post-intervention
interview assessment at the end of implementation cycle
(Time 2, about 3 –4 months after the Time 1). To facilitate
coordination of program implementation activities, par-
ticipating MCH will be provided with two tablets and a
small incentive which could offset implementation costs.
Sample size
A randomly selected sample of 90 adolescent-parent dyads
will be recruited. It has been suggested that a minimum of
30 participants per group/arm is sufficient for individual
IPT and IPT-G pilot studies based on similar intervention
studies in LMICs [ 17,18,23].
Analysis plan for the feasibility outcomes
Data collected through 2 cohorts will be analyzed. Quan-
titative analysis will be focused on examining the follow-
ing questions:
/C15Examine acceptability, appropriateness, usefulness,
engagement, and fidelity for both full and mini
versions of integrated mhGAP/IPT-G intervention
implementation using task-shifting/sharing approach
in MCH contexts.
/C15Examine MCH service quality change patterns
before and after implementation of the mhGAP/
IPT-G model will improve.Kumar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:136 Page 8 of 18
/C15Examine whether pregnant adolescents in the
IPT-G will have better outcomes relative to con-
trol, but high impacts/effect size for the IPT-G
Full version.
The following stop-go criteria will be used to deter-
mine whether to proceed to the main trial: the recruit-
ment proceeds well so that the first IPT-G cohort can
proceed by the end of the first month of the specified re-
cruitment period. The IPT therapists that is the trained
CHVs and nurses demonstrate adequate levels of treat-
ment fidelity to the WHO IPT-G checklist adherence
available in the manual and 70% of participants attend at
least 5 of the available sessions in the course of their
treatment and 80% are successfully followed up at pri-
mary endpoint.
Quantitative analysis for implementation outcomes will
be based on data collected throughout the implementa-
tion period, and analyzed separately for each time point
as well as jointly to create overall summary scores. Ana-
lysis for the MCH service outcomes will be based on pre-
post intervention data using paired-t tests and repeated
measures. We will examine patterns separately and
jointly for two MCH clinics. Analysis for estimating size
of impact on mental health (depression) and family func-
tioning will be based on multi-level modeling, adjusting
for family/group nesting effects. Post-interventioneffects/impacts will be estimated as a function of base-
line levels of the corresponding outcome variables and
intervention status. Effect size (regardless the statistical
testing significant level) will be computed. Quantitative
data for implementation outcomes, MCH service out-
comes, and adolescent mental health effectiveness out-
comes will be examined separately.
Qualitative data will be transcribed and analyzed using
similar techniques described in Aim 1. We will review all
focus group discussion data and use grounded theory ap-
proach to search for emerging themes using open and axial
coding. Analysis will focus on themes related to MCH ser-
vice quality (on providing both MCH and mental health
care), feedback on implementat ion process and intervention
contents, and perspectives on theory of change.
Methodology for sub-study 1
To understand ‘fit’of the mhGAP/IPT-G and study
barriers/strategies (in 5 CFIR domains) to promote
utilization and impacts of mhGAP/IPT-G, we will
carry out a mixed methods study, including qualita-
tive and quantitative data collection. Quantitative data
collection will focus on D&I readiness contexts and
new D&I tools pilot testing (see Table 4and Fig. 3
for data gathering activities for the entire study and
SPIRIT chart).Fig. 2 Schedule of Enrolment, Interventions, and Assessments.**Recommended content can be displayed using various schematic formats. See

Data collection focus and procedures
We will conduct eight focus groups ( n= 40) with repre-
sentative diverse stakeholders (i.e., including two groups
for pregnant adolescents and new adolescent mothers,
two groups for adolescent caregivers and partners, two
groups for MCH staff, 1 group for community advocates
and policy leaders, and 1 group for child and adolescent
mental health professionals). Each focus group discus-
sion (FGD) will have about 5 participants. Each group
will participate in three FGD meetings. One meeting will
focus on barriers/strategies related to mhGAP-IG, and
the other meeting will focus on barriers/strategies re-
lated to IPT-G. The third FGD would be focusing onmental health treatment preferences of pregnant adoles-
cents. Each focus group will last 1½ to 2 h. Participants
will participate in an FGD and complete a survey, and
these will be carried out in English or Kiswahili (as Eng-
lish is the official language in Kenya). Focus group
guides/questions and quantitative survey will be adapted
from existing D&I studies [ 48], or existing D&I measures
(see measures under sub-study 1). Stakeholders ’views
on barriers and strategies in five CFIR domains will be
discussed separately for mhGAP and IPT-G. Informed
by our previous needs ’assessment work, strategies re-
lated to livelihood problem, partner/family engagement,
knowledge gap, and stigma reduction will also beTable 4 Research implementation steps and data gathering activities (Continued)

explored. Key information that we will gather from dif-
ferent groups of stakeholders is summarized below.
/C15For FGDs with adolescents and families/partners
(n= 20, recruited through two MCH clinics that we
have partnership with from previous MCH
epidemiological studies), discussion will focus on
CFIR individual, intervention, and inner setting
domains, and examine their knowledge related to
perinatal depression, and views (including barriers
and potential strategies) related to adolescent
pregnancy, mhGAP/IPT-G (fit, usefulness, perceived
feasibility and usefulness of IPT-G Full and Mini
versions), family member/partner engagement,
support, and empowerment strategies, and
preference for integrated mental health-MCH ser-
vices. Eligibility criteria for adolescent participants
would be: participants of ages 13 –18 years, willing-
ness to sign consent form, being pregnant or a new
mother for female participants, willing to fill the
questionnaires and participate in the interviews,
consent to publish the findings. For other stake-
holders including health facility providers, adult
caregivers, community health workers eligibility in-
cludes: above 18 years of age, willingness to sign in-
formed consent to participate in the study and for
the deliberations to be recorded, willing to engage
with the issues around mental health and adolescent
pregnancy conducted through survey or interviews,
and consent to publish the findings.
/C15For FGDs with MCH providers/staff and mental
health professionals (n= 15, recruited through the
two MCH clinics [same as the sites for family
recruitment] and mental health professional
networks), discussion will focus on the CFIR inner
setting, individual/staff, intervention, and process
domains. We will examine fit, barriers, and
implementation strategies for mhGAP and IPT-G
implementation in MCH settings (e.g., collaborators ’
roles, task-shifting/sharing strategies, workflow logis-
tic/coordination strategies), staff attitude/belief to-
ward EBI practices, perceived effectiveness, and
MCH implementation climate.
/C15For FGDs with the community advocates and policy
stakeholders (n= 5, recruited through Ministry of
Health and NGO networks), discussion will focus on
the CFIR intervention, process and outer setting
domains, and examine barriers and strategies related to
mhGAP and IPT-G. In addition, community aware-
ness/public educational and st igma reduction strategies
(outer setting strategies) w ill be explored to facilitate
community support to addres s adolescent pregnancy
and maternal mental health needs, which also has im-
plications for public health impact promotion [ 49,50].Results from this study will be used to inform the
adaptation of mhGAP and IPT-G contents, adolescents/
family members ’engagement activities, implementation
process, and training of the implementation team. An
adapted manual for mhGAP-IG and IPT-G (Full and
Mini versions) will be developed.
Methodology for sub-study 2
To better identify mhGAP/IPT-G workflow barriers and
strategies in MCH contexts, MCH site visits and work-
flow observation will be arranged for the Community
and Technical Advisory Board members ( n= 22) (see
Table 3). The observation will focus on MCH structure
and perinatal service workflow. For the four adolescent
representatives, we will seek two pregnant adolescents
and two new adolescent mothers. The eligibility criterion
would be as follows: willing to consent to participate,
one pregnant adolescent and one new mother between
ages 13 –16, another pregnant adolescent, and new
mother between ages 16 –18 willing to join the meetings
held at the community center or at the health facility.
For all other stakeholders of the community advisory,
the eligibility would be as follows: to sign informed con-
sent to participate in the study and for the deliberations
to be recorded, willing to engage with the issues around
mental health and adolescent pregnancy, and willing to
commute to the health facility or community center for
meetings three times a year. Additionally, there would
be a technical advisory board. The technical advisory
board comprises of members whose organizations pro-
vided support letters during the grant and formally com-
mitted to providing technical guidance. Their eligibility
includes the following: adults above 18 of years and
technical persons representing mental health and health
policy implementing partners in Kenya, willing to sign
consent form for participation in the study, and willing-
ness for discussion to be recorded. This will allow the
Board and research members to gain better understand-
ing about the clinical set up, implementation barriers
and strategies, which will facilitate better and more sus-
tainable workflow plan/strategy development to support
mhGAP/IPT-G implementation. To ensure confidential-
ity, informed consent for all participants will be obtained
prior to the data collection. Participating provider
personnel and family members will be compensated for
their time. Participating mental health professionals and
officers of NGO/ Ministry of Education/ Ministry of
Health will also be compensated.
Results from sub-studies 1 and 2 will be used to in-
form the adaptation of mhGAP/IPT-G implementation
protocol in MCH context and training manual develop-
ment for mhGAP/IPT-G implementation. Additional
feedback will be sought from Advisory Board before
using these.Kumar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:136 Page 12 of 18
Capacity building
To build implementation research capacity, the lead in-
vestigator along with her co-investigators and mentors
will provide a short/intensive 3-day course on child
mental health implementation methodology for research
team members, relevant stakeholders, and graduate level
students ( n= 20 in year 2). To build service capacity for
adolescent perinatal depression, we will train MCH im-
plementation team ( n= 16 from two MCH clinics) for
task-shifting/sharing collaborative approach of mhGAP-
IG and IPT-G implementation. Members of the imple-
mentation team (to be determined in sub-study 1, which
may include family members/adolescents if peer leader/
empowerment implementation strategy will be used) will
receive a 4-day training (including one-day practice
training) to prepare them for the implementation. Add-
itional 8-group coaching/support from the clinical team
(provided after each IPT-G group session) during the
first intervention implementation period will also be
provided. The coaching support after the first imple-
mentation will be based on the identified needs.Data collection measures and procedures for capacity
building
Quality and impacts of training will be assessed through
attendance tracking, after training satisfaction evalu-
ation, pre- to post-training knowledge/competence as-
sessment with trainees. The measures will be developed
during the study period, and adapted from the research
teams ’previous D&I studies [ 57].
Analysis plan
We anticipate capacity building will significantly im-
prove trainees ’(nurses and community health workers)
knowledge and skills in implementation research and de-
livering of depression intervention. To document feasi-
bility, qualitative training notes and feedback data will
be gathered. Themes related to appropriateness and use-
fulness of the training, partnership and lessons learned
for mhGAP/IPT-G implementation capacity building
will be analyzed and reported for improvement in future
capacity building approach. Quantitative data related to
knowledge and competence will be analyzed using pair-t

tests and repeated measures to explore impact across
different types of MCH personnel.
Ethical and research protection considerations in working
with high risk adolescents
The protection of the rights of research participants is
ensured by several aspects of the study protocol:
/C15First, the principal investigator (PI) and all members
of the study team will complete training in human
subjects ’protection, as required. This training
consists of completion of the formalized training
program sponsored by the Kenyan IRB as well as
ongoing training by the PI in all aspects of human
subjects ’protection through NIH and her mentors ’
institutions where she will undergo training.
/C15Second, all study procedures are reviewed with staff,
mentors, and advisory board members from the
perspective of ensuring the protection of the rights
of study participants. This includes training of study
staff in consent and enrollment procedures to
minimize coercion and ensure the principles of
informed consent, maintaining study material and
information in order to protect study participants ’
privacy and confidentiality, and ensuring that
assessment procedures are conducted in a manner
that protects study participants ’privacy and rights.
In addition, the study advisory board and Kenyan
IRB will inform study participants about protection
of their rights by independent institutional board
that would have approved the study.
/C15Third, both study participants and staff will be made
aware of the limits to confidentiality. Pregnant
adolescents and MCH staff/CHWs will be fully
informed of these limits at the time of consent.
Study staff will be trained in the requirement to
adhere to legal statutes regarding reporting to child
protection agencies information obtained in the
course of the study that leads a staff member to
suspect that an adolescent is at risk for physical
abuse or neglect or is being abused or neglected.
There is a protocol detailing the responsibility of
staff members to share information with the PI
immediately or as soon as possible after the
information has been obtained. The protocol
requires review of the information to determine
whether a report to the protection agency is
required.
/C15Finally, in the event of a clinical emergency or other
crisis, research staff will be trained in basic crisis
management including obstetric and pediatric
emergencies and able to contact the PI and her
Kenyan mentors. Staff will be trained in a
manualized protocol for handling a variety of crisesthat may present to staff at the health facility or the
community venue during interviews. The protocol
for handling these issues addresses the safety of both
study participants and study staff. The protocol also
details the need for supervision in all instances.
Integrity of research data
All information collected from study participants during
the course of the project will be kept confidentially. This in-
cludes information collected and stored in written and elec-
tronic form. As indicated previously, data storage also
ensures integrity of research data and rights of study partic-
ipants. Paper copies of identify ing information, assessment
measures, and other study mate rials will be maintained in
locked research files in locked offices. Electronic data are
secured by server maintenance that includes password pro-
tection, limited access to data by staff, different levels of ac-
cess depending on the person ’s specific level on the staff,
and server securities, all of w hich ensure a high degree of
protection from unauthorized users. Information will be
coded by participant identification number. Linking of
identifying information to research data will be kept to a
minimum and even then, under key and lock and only ac-
cessible to key study staff. Iden tity of study participants will
not be revealed in presentations or publications of study
findings. Participants will be given the opportunity to con-
sent to (or decline) the use of any specific data collected
from them during the intervent ion phase for use in presen-
tations or publications.
Data monitoring
The project staff will continu ously evaluate the experience
of study participants, with particular regard to participant
reactions and risk exposure. Trends in data and findings
will be examined periodically (yearly) in order to identify
any changes in risk/benefit ratios that might necessitate a
modification of the assessment protocol. In the unlikely
event that monitoring of dat a reveals unanticipated or
otherwise negative findings; t h eP Iw o u l dr e p o r tt h e s et o
the field in the form of a presentation or publication. Fur-
thermore, it would be critical to assess, to the degree pos-
sible, what characteristics of the study protocol contributed
to the findings. Given that the study is nested in a career
development grant given to the first author and that it is a
pilot trial, the mentors and technical advisory board would
act as a data monitoring board along with Fogarty/NIMH
annual research reporting. General Purpose of the board:
This is not a formal clinical trial DSMB board however a
mechanism to address any adverse events that might occur
during the study period. Adverse events occurring in any
study participants will be repo rted to the Kenyatta National
hospital and University of Nai robi institutional review
board within 48 h of occurrence and the external review
boards (advisory committee me mbers of the K43 proposalKumar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:136 Page 14 of 18
and key mentors at University of Nairobi, University of
Washington St Louis and New York University) within 72
h. On a monthly basis the study team will review summary
reports of the adverse events. A local Data Safety and Mon-
itoring Board (DSMB) consisting of DW, BA, and OG has
been established and will review interim comparisons of
the trial arms at 3 and 6 monthly intervals. The general
purpose of this board is to maximize the safety and privacy
of all study participants, and en sure the integrity, validity,
and confidentiality of the data c ollection and analysis proce-
dures. The protocol described herein details the integration
of the goals of the DSMB into all aspects of study design,
implementation, and review. The study team will report
any serious and unexpected adverse events, or any prob-
lems that involve risk to the pa rticipants or others, to the
Nairobi city council operational research review board and
the Kenyan IRB. The study team will report any serious ad-
verse events, along with the Kenyan IRB review response/
outcome, to the NIH.
Discussion
Pregnant adolescents in SSA are burdened by significant
unmet health needs including lack of access to mental
health services. This study seeks to enrich WHO ’sm e n t a l
health depression intervention by carefully studying poten-
tial implementation challenges and identifying and integrat-
ing culturally and developmentally sensitive
implementation strategies that fit primary care settings in
Kenya. This study addresses in tervention, service imple-
mentation, and public health research gaps for perinatal de-
pression in adolescents in LMICs by utilizing mhGAP-IG,
and WHO recommended IPT-G. Considering system, lead-
ership, research strengthenin g needs (see the description of
the Action Plan in Background section) and needs for cost-
effective and culturally sensit ive depression interventions
for pregnant adolescent in Kenya, we will apply a multi-
disciplinary/stakeholder partnership approach to adapt and
test mhGAP-IG depression intervention guideline/tools
and IPT-G to be implemented in MCH clinics. Three key
implementation research ques tions will be studied: (i) how
to improve fit of the mhGAP-depression intervention
model (including IPT-G) for pregnant adolescents in
Kenya, (ii) how to effectively int egrate task-shifting/sharing
and collaborative strategies with MCH clinical workflow to
implement mhGAP depression intervention for pregnant
adolescents in MCH settings, an d (iii) whether the adapted
mhGAP and IPT-G are feasible, appropriate, acceptable,
and useful in addressing perinatal depression in adoles-
cents. Considering the deman d-resource challenge, this
study will also explore related strategies, such as study feasi-
bility of applying Long and Mini version of IPT-G (i.e., 8 vs.
4 sessions) and other potential cost-effective task shifting/
sharing strategies ( e.g., family/adolescent peer co-lead im-
plementation approach). The IPT-G Full version includes 3phases of interven tion: defining “interpersonal inventory
(through examining the interp ersonal context of depression
and exploring the links between the depression and their
environment), making chang es (through communication
analysis, role play and effective strategies to improve social
support and relationships), a nd identify successes and plan
for independent application of IPT principles [ 41]. It has
been found to be highly acceptable and efficacious to peri-
natal women in LMIC populations [ 42]. Considering the
demand-resource gap, it is critical to consider offering IPT-
G Mini version. The development of the shorter (Mini)
version will be based on recent work [ 43,44]t h a th a sd e v e l -
oped a three-sessions versi on. We will adapt and study the
fit of the Full and Mini version in MCH contexts (under
sub-study 1). After sub-studies 1 and 2 there may be possi-
bilities of reviewing and am ending the study protocol to
bolster the implementation m odel and research design for
the pilot feasibility trial. In such a scenario, the PI after ap-
provals from the mentors and technical advisory group
would make amendments to the IRB.
The proposed research offers following innovative
approaches: (1) There is almost no literature on imple-
mentation research for adolescent perinatal depression in
MCH context using mhGAP evidence-based guidelines.
This study tests an innovative collaborative approach that
integrates task-shifting/sharing strategies to implement
mhGAP guidelines and IPT-G depression intervention in
low resource MCH cares in Kenya. (2) Considering Ken-
yan MCH health service contexts, social cultural contexts,
and multiple challenges faced by adolescents, the pro-
posed project explores strategies to address multi-level
barriers (especially at the provider, family, and individual
levels). Our approach to integrate and test bundled strat-
egies is innovative in addressing multiple challenges that
are commonly encountered in Kenya and other LMICs.
Thus, the impact of this work may be greater than the
traditional EBI efficacy research approach that tends to
focus on intervention contents and ignore intervention/
service implementation challenges. (3) Our plan to explore
Full and Mini versions of IPT-G and other low-cost sus-
tainable strategies (i.e., family empowerment strategies) of-
fers a highly novel alternative solution to address the
demand-resource challenge faced in LMICs and many
other developed countries. If successful, our study has po-
tential not only to serve more adolescents with lower
costs, but also empower communities to contribute to
public health solutions. Knowledge gained will be relevant
to both LMICs and developed countries.
Study dissemination plans
Study results would be shared with local communities
and agencies through publication channels. Throughout
the five-year study period, we will hold several informa-
tion sharing and dissemination meetings and invite localKumar et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:136 Page 15 of 18
and international stakeholders (e.g., leaders from Minis-
try of Health, Nairobi County Health Directorate, other
stakeholders such as WHO, UNFPA who have provided
support) to discuss adolescent perinatal depression de-
liberations and trial findings. We will also create brief re-
ports to share findings with relevant local and
international health and policy agencies, through mul-
tiple publication channels (e.g., University websites, so-
cial media, and Fogarty International Centre/NIH,
University and interregional and national partnership as-
sociated networks). Presenting findings of the work to
adolescent groups and MCH young clients in the two in-
formal health centers where the study will be carried
out. With the support of the technical and community
advisory board we will organize health fair dissemination
activities for adolescent groups within the community
and MCH centers where peripartum adolescents and
other young mothers seek services. Presenting our re-
search study in local and international research and
service-related conferences. All final peer-reviewed man-
uscripts from this study will also be submitted to the
digital archive PubMed Central. We will present key
findings in the University of Nairobi medical research
forums and in the key University research meetings. In-
formation would also be spread through Community
Health Unit of Ministry of health and the Nairobi county
directorate outreach channels to generate awareness of
adolescent pregnancy and mental health burden includ-
ing available resources to address depression. Progress
reports would be submitted to Kenyan partnering agen-
cies and Fogarty Foundation and NIMH Research Office.
Each year, the study will prepare a report that summa-
rizes the study ’s progress toward recruitment goals,
quality of data (e.g., appropriate completion of forms),
participation rates, and key findings. Several publications
have been planned with the in-country collaborators as
well as research mentors.
