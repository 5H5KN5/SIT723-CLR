for people with long-term conditions. A
qualitative study

Abstract
Background: For people with long-term conditions, social networks provide a potentially central means of mobilising,
mediating and accessing support for health and well-being. Few interventions address the implementation of improving
engagement with and through social networks. This pap er describes the development and implementation of a
web-based tool which comprises: netw ork mapping, user-centred preferenc e elicitation and need assessment and
facilitated engagement with resources. The study aimed to determine whether the int ervention was acceptable,
implementable and acted to enhance support and to add to theory concerning social networks and engagement
with resources and activities.
Methods: A longitudinal design with 15 case studies used ethnographic methods comprising video, non-participant
observation of intervention delivery and qualitative interviews (baseline, 6 and 12 months). Participants were people
with type 2 diabetes living in a marginalis ed island community. Facilitators were local health trainers and care navigators.
Analysis applied concepts concerning implementation of technology for self-management support to explain how newpractices of work were operationalised and how the technology impacted on relationships fit with everyday life andallowed for visual feedback.
Results: Most participants reported identifying and taking up new activities as a result of using the tool. Thematic
analysis suggested that workability of the tool was predicated on disruption and reconstruction of networks, challenging/
supportive facilitation and change and reflection over time concerning network support. Visualisation of the network
enabled people to mobilise support and engage in new activities. The tool aligned synergistically with the facilitators ’role
of linking people to local resources.
Conclusions: The social network tool works through a process of initiating positive disruption of established self-
management practice through mapping and reflection on personal network membership and support. This opens up
possibilities for reconstructing self-management differently from current practice. Key facets of successful implementationwere: the visual maps of networks and support options; facilita tion characterised by a perceived lack of status difference
which assisted engagement and constructive discussion of support and preferences for activities; and background work(a reliable database, tailored preferences, option reduction) for facilitator and user ease of use.

Background
Policy and practice in relation to long-term conditions
management are increasingly directed to a greater focus onthe delivery of healthcare in public health spaces. Interven-
tions are being developed that extend to include imple-
mentation across a range of settings. Evaluation of theimplementation of evidence-based practices pertaining to
long-term condition management is increasingly common-
place with more attention being paid to complexitiessuch as multi-morbidity. There has been less focus on
evaluation using implementation science methods of
co-produced (where design and delivery of services isshared with users) and patient focussed interventions
in open and informal healthcare settings [1].
Social interaction and the impact of significant others has
been associated with whether or not a self-care regime isfollowed, and autonomy and control has been identified as
having relevance to designing acceptable self-care strategies
[ 2 ] .E v i d e n c eo ft h ep o s i t i v er o l es o c i a ln e t w o r k sh a v ei n
managing a long-term condition suggests that current self-
management initiatives emphasising individual motivationand behaviour change are likely to be enhanced by the de-
velopment and implementation of strategies for linking
people to wider resources thro ugh engaging social networks
and local support [3– 5]. Implementation in patient, domes-
tic and community settings is multi-layered requiring a
focus on co-production and the implementation of strat-egies which cross informal and formal healthcare boundar-
ies. In this paper, we focus on e valuating the acceptability,
appropriateness and implementa tion of a collectively orien-
tated long-term condition self-management strategy. Ratherthan an exclusive focus on individual self-management, a
social network approach aims to enhance the take-up ofavailable and underused collective support. The approach
and web-based tool have been designed to improve people ’s
ability to navigate and negotiate support available from
within personal social networks and extend this to engage-
ment with local groups and organisations [6]. This builds
on an existing body of knowledge concerning implementa-tion of self-management interventions. Previous research
has shown that self-management support is not routinely
adopted and implemented in primary care because of the
perceived lack of relevance and fit to feasible and recognis-
able sources of support. Addition ally, facilitating sources of
self-management support is not viewed as a priority by
healthcare professionals [7]. Thus, the tool has been devel-
oped to orientate delivery in community and domesticsettings where people with long- term conditions are elicited
as partners in making health and well-being choices withsupport from a semi-professionalised workforce.
The practice of self-management for participants is for
the most part orientated to the immediacy of presentday requirements and the availability of a set of enablingconnections, links and activities for managing and livingdaily life with a condition [7, 8]. Network members located
in the personal community of a person with a long-term
condition are sources of emotional, practical and illness-related ‘work ’[6]. Where such support is substantive, it can
make a major contribution to an individual in maintainingand sustaining a functioning and meaningful life. Con-versely, where support is limited, people often report poorer
health-related outcomes and a lack of access to resources
to help them deal with day-to-day problems, or to under-stand and manage their condition. Strategies of support
which take health literacy into consideration have been
called for because of the former ’s relationship to improved
health status and participation in healthcare [9, 10].
Diverse social networks that extend beyond health
professionals and close fam ily to incorporate casual ac-
quaintances, friends and groups seem to provide greater
protective health and wellness benefits than those with
smaller or family centred networks [11]. A recent reviewpaper suggests three mechanisms are implicated in mobilis-
ing network support. Network navigation (identifying who
should be contacted to make decisions or provide help to
access previously unused resources and prioritising access
to some ties whilst abandoning others), negotiation within
networks (reshaping relationships, roles, expectations and
terms of engagement and communication between and by
network members) and building collective efficacy (develop-
ing shared perceptions and capacity aimed at successful
management through shared efforts and objectives) [4, 12].
Access to resources to enable self-management can be
built through new connections or reconfiguring the useof existing networks to engage with wider resources em-
bedded in voluntary and community groups and organi-
sations [13, 14]. The intervention discussed here buildson an approach, tested in an RCT, which used tailored
information and telephone-guided access to community
resources. The RCT demonstrated effectiveness in im-proving health-related outcomes [15]. Participation in
community organisations is consistently related to better
health status and improved efforts to self-management[3, 16]. Engagement with such support is likely to be
improved by user awareness of existing local groups and
reflexion about their suitability. To this end, we devel-
oped a web-based tool which takes a multi-level, net-worked approach to person-centred self-managementsupport which takes these mechanisms into account.
The tool (GENIE —Generating Engagement in Network
Involvement) maps social networks, allows for user-
centred preference and need assessment and facilitates
engagement with local support resources.
The aim of this paper is to determine firstly whether the
intervention is acceptable and implementable in practice(in a UK setting) and works to enhance support for people
with long-term conditions and secondly to add to theoryand understanding of how and why knowledge concerningKennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 2 of 15
social networks can improve engagement with resources
and activities [17].
The intervention
GENIE has a number of elements which are theoretically
and evidence-based (see Table 1 and Additional file 1).GENIE has been developed to be an intervention which
is co-produced as the person with the long-term condi-
tion has ownership of the network map and links tofavoured activities. The facilitator is there to guide them
through the process. Facilitators could be from a lay or
professional background. The process was designed totake between 30 to 40 min to deliver and consisted of
the following stages:
Filter questions: To tailor results to the individual.
Stage 1: Mapping of the individual ’s current social sup-
port network using a concentric circles method.
Stage 2: Eliciting values and preferences for activities
and support resources.
Stage 3: Linking individuals to prioritised and valued
activities and resources (links are to a pre-created data-base where local organisations and resources have been
categorised —see Table 2).
Stage 4: Present options in a user-friendly way with
clear details about access.
The concentric circles technique is initially used to
gain insight into the user ’s current situation regarding
self-management support and who they view as import-ant in the management of their condition [18, 19] and
then to further map the people and groups who couldpotentially provide extended support. An overview of
the completed network is provided to check with the
user that the network represents their situation eitherfor personal use or to provide a summary to share with
health professionals. This included the number of net-
work members and a description of the type of network:diverse, family-focussed, friend-focussed or isolated [20].
In order to simplify navigation and links to activities
and support, the preference stage of the tool was de-signed to closely align to the articulation of the user ’s
values and interests. Suggestions for health-related activ-ities included exercise or weight-loss groups and thingslike hobby groups, support for independent living,
volunteering opportunities and educational courses.
GENIE has been designed to fit and integrate with
everyday life, to be easy to use and to engage peoplevisually providing immediate feedback on their social
network via a co-created visible map and a Google-generated map of the local activities and groups they
have indicated an interest in.
Methods
Table 3 outlines the strategy used to implement GENIE.
Theories concerning implementation of technology forself-management support have been used to assist the
explanation of how new or modified practices associated
with GENIE are operationalised by users and how thetechnology impacts on relationships, fits with everyday
life and allows visual feedback [21, 22].
A longitudinal case study design was used to identify
the processes and dynamics of delivering the interventionand to capture individual outcomes of the use of the tool
over time. Methods included the use of video (to recordthe baseline facilitated delivery of the intervention), non-
participant observation and semi-structured qualitative
interviews. The longitudinal design captured changes insocial network support over time as establishing new
activities may require or result in different support from
different people. Following individual case trajectoriesover a 12-month period with interviews at baseline (T1),
6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) generated sufficient
data to compare, contrast and examine cohort commonal-ties and differences (see Table 4). Network maps were revis-
ited at T2 and T3 to add or delete network members and
to allow participants to move people or groups betweencircles to reflect changes in their perceived importance.
We focussed on identifying a deprived and margina-
lised setting as an area where people were most likely tobenefit from network support strategies [3]. Deprivation
is associated with: isolation; poor health literacy; poor
access to health resources, information and sources ofinfluences; insufficient social capital; low confidence and
higher differentials in power with professionals [23 –25].
The Isle of Wight (IoW) was identified as a site for im-
plementation because of unequally distributed resources
and limited access to further support. Connections were
made with those organising the My Life a Full Life
(MLAFL) programme (see Table 3) which seeks to de-
liver integrated care and support on the island for olderpeople with long-term conditions and those with mentalhealth needs to increase independence and inclusion in
communities. Thus, the intervention aligned with
MLAFL ’s programme of delivery and community
approach (http://www.mylifeafulllife.com/Vanguard/Van-
guard.htm). Meetings were held to decide on ways to de-
liver GENIE and identify appropriate local organisations
(the charity age UK) and potential facilitators (health
trainers and care navigators). The latter are relativelynew additions to the healthcare workforce [26] and are
charged with providing ‘information and support to
people about healthy living and how to make healthier
lifestyle choices ’and ensuring ‘individuals are engaged
and connected with their local community and otherorganisations to make best use of resources. ’
Two training sessions were held for the ‘facilitators ’,
local managers and commissioners (see Additional file 2Outline of Training) who were given access and trainingin how to use the tools needed to deliver GENIE.Kennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 3 of 15

support (SMS)As starting point for a discussion
about how to extend existing
support, access support from new
sources, or change existing practice.Support work can be: illness-related(taking medications and measurements,understanding symptoms, makingappointments); everyday (housekeeping,
child rearing, support for diet and
exercise, shopping, personal care); oremotional (comforting when worriedor anxious, well-being, companionship).

approaches which often fail because
they do not deal with existingrelationships to negotiate time andspace for new activities

or needing help with transportThe user is made a capable and
willing to reciprocate participant
To reduce choice and complexities
arising from information overload
counterproductive for learning, socialengagement and social support
particularly where there is
poor health literacy.Choices are tailored using a series of
questions and based on preference
and enjoyment rather than on health-based need. For example, the facilitatorprompts by asking:
“Are there things you used to do
that you don ’t do anymore? What
stopped you from continuing to
do these things? ”
This gives clues about how to identify
the most relevant type of support,
the likely barriers they may encounter,and how to encourage them torestart these activities.
Network members are selected as
potential buddies to accompany
them to new activities.
Asked to select the three activities
or resources they are most interestedin and agree to try them out. The
locations of the activities are

The intervention and approach were designed to be
generic and thus of use to people with long-term phys-
ical and mental health problems as well as those who
are isolated and lonely. Here, Type 2 diabetes was se-lected as an exemplar condition because of its preva-
lence and impact of self-management requirements on
daily life including the nature of relationships (supportfrom a range of sources has been shown to generate col-
lective efficacy for people with diabetes) [12, 27] and
likely impact on reducing risks associated with diabetes(for example in relation to food and diet) [28].
Sample and delivery
T h eU Ks a m p l ew a so n ec a s es t u d yi naw i d e rE u r o p e a nproject involving five other countries with similar samples(giving a total of 90 participants). The UK implementation
has been used in this paper as the fullest exemplar of all the
elements of GENIE. Case study participants were selectedto represent a range of ages and gender. Inclusion criteria
were adults over 18 years living in the community with type
2 diabetes; exclusion criteria were those receiving palliativec a r ea n dt h o s ew h ow e r eu n able to communicate in
English. Participants were recruited from existing clients offacilitators ( n= 3), from course attendees on the local
diabetes education programme ( n=6 ) , t h r o u g h a l o c a l
diabetes support group ( n= 4) and through researcher con-
tact ( n= 2). Delivery of the intervention was at the conveni-
ence of the participant and took place in individual homes,
the public library, places of work and medical centres.
Data collection
Data was collected from 15 videos and observations of the
facilitator-participant interaction at the point of interven-tion delivery and from in-depth i nterviews with participants
at baseline, 6- and 12-month post-intervention. Observa-tional notes (by EJ) recorded time points of sense-makingand engagement with the intervention [21] and non-verbal
interactions between the facilitator and the participant so
these could be revisited for video-elicitation purposes in thebaseline interview and during t he analysis. Observational
notes were used as a means of engaging participants tothink aloud about how they made sense of or engaged withthe intervention at certain points.
The baseline T1 interview explored the participant ’s
experience of being guided through the intervention interms of acceptability and acces sibility. The researcher used
a combination of a semi-structured interview schedule andindividualised questions relat ing to specific observations
made during the interventio n process. The interview was
guided by the following key questions:
/C15Was the intervention of relevance?
/C15How acceptable was the mode of delivery and howeasy was it to use?
/C15What new insights were gained?
/C15How much use is this type of information?
/C15Who might benefit most from this type ofintervention?
Two weeks following the delivery of the intervention,
participants received a follow-up phone call from the re-
searcher to obtain initial feedback. Changes to participants ’
personal support network and engagement with commu-
nity activities/groups were ascertained and recorded at T2
by means of face-to-face interviews and again at T3 by
means of telephone interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded, fully transcribed and anonymised.
Analysis
Interview transcripts were coded and categorised the
participant ’s experience of being facilitated through
GENIE and to gain a better understanding of the mecha-
nisms of engagement with the process (T1) as a precur-
sor to thematic analysis.
Video recordings of the intervention delivery were
viewed independently by three members of the researchteam (EJ, IV, AK), coded and discussed in light of the
observational notes highlighting engagement and sense-making taken at the time of the intervention delivery.
Normalisation process theory was used as a set of sensi-
tising concepts for video analysis [21]. A worked ex-ample of how this was used can be found in Additional
file 3. This ensured a structured examination of the
intervention process and the interaction between theTable 1 GENIE elements (Continued)

Actors Partner organisations: My Life a Full Life and Age UK Isle of Wight (see text)
Facilitators: health trainers and care navigatorsUsers: People with type 2 diabetes living in the community
Actions Facilitators use the social network tool GENIE with their clients to map out social support
networks and link people to local resources
Action targets The organisations: support facilitators; facilitate training process; find key local stakeholders
for working group to develop sustainability strategy.
Facilitators: attend training; use GENIE tool with clients and recruit 15 case study subjects
(n≤2 per facilitator); share and discuss learning with researchers
Users: provided with personal GENIE web account; work through GENIE with facilitator;prioritise up to three new activities or resources to try.
Temporality Assumption that the user will access the chosen activities or resources soon after the
delivery of the intervention.
Dose Facilitated use of GENIE happens once. This includes:
1. Creating a social network map using a web-based concentric circle tool.
2. Discussion around the type of support shown in the map and activities they used toenjoy but have dropped.3. Questions concerning preferences.
4. Prioritisation of up to three activities or forms of support.
5. Generation of a map of the chosen activities in relation to the user ’s address.The user can
access the website through their password-protected personal account at any time to redrawtheir network map and find new activities or resources.
Implementation outcome affected 1. Users have a more diverse support network.
2. Adoption of the tool by the facilitators as part of their routine assessment of clients.3. Sustained maintenance and updating of the database of local organisations with input fromfacilitators and local people.4. Partner organisations and commissioners can extract data to see
where there are gaps in resource provision.Kennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 7 of 15
themes drawn from the interview and observational
data in the GENIE study. These concepts were taken
into account in order to focus on the relationshipsan individual had with the social network members
who provided support.
Ethical considerations
Informed written consent was obtained from participantsand facilitators in advance of data collection. The study wasapproved by the Faculty of Health Sciences Ethics Commit-
tee, University of Southampton, Reference number 9380.
Results
Fifteen case study participants were recruited representing
a range of ages (43 to 73) and domestic situations. The ma-jority were male, retired, had below average income and
most had a college or university education (see Table 5).
Acceptability and implementation
GENIE achieved the primary aim of getting participants to
take up new activities and illuminated the presence ofadditional forms of cognitive engagement. In terms of
understanding and engagement, both participants and
facilitators understood what they had to do. Networkmaps were created, showed change over time and activ-
ities and new resources identified. This method enabled
the following of how network members were involved andbecame engaged in the process, providing new insights
and understanding of the work of navigating and negotiat-
ing relationships.New activities
Nearly all participants in the case study increased en-gagement with an activity, resource or service duringthe 12-month period following the intervention. Most
activities were new, but some represented the rekind-
ling and uptake of former interests. The most signifi-cant activities were some form of walking and healthy
eating advice (Table 2). GENIE was not relevant in
one instance (a participant who had a very active life-style, a diverse network and believed that the onset of
her diabetes was not related to lifestyle choices). In
terms of relevance and acceptability, participants andfacilitators engaged readily with the practicalities and
potential of the intervention. Analysis has helped to
provide a greater theoreti cal understanding of what
activities were taken up and why.
Whilst technological factors (internet connectivity and
competence with using a computer interface) had someinitial impact on acceptability, it was other aspects of the
intervention that had more lasting effects. The website it-
self was rarely accessed following the initial interventio-n—it had served a purpose and was seemingly discarded
appropriately. Alongside the concepts of relationships, fitand visibility; themes that emerged in analysis related topositive disruption and reconstruction; temporal change
and reflection; and non-threatening but gently challenging
facilitation.
‘A shock that that ’sm e ’: disruption and reconstruction
The concentric circle diagram had a powerful impact on
how a person saw and understood their support net-
work. Participants reacted positively to the network

mapping exercise and were quick to engage with and
understand the implications of a picture they had helped
create showing their central position, surrounded bymembers of their social network. Most participants had
not previously visualised themselves in this way. Some
were surprised by the size of their network or by theirposition in relation to other network members. This
sudden, visual feedback could be described as a ‘light
bulb ’moment.
“What it [circle diagram] identified were things that I
hadn ’t really thought about ……I’ve never asked myself
the question who am I? Where do I fit in the bigcircle?.....I was just surprised. I thought is that really me?
Is that really what I do? Is that where it all fits? Does itfit? …..I just never joined it all up, never thought about
joining it all up. ….. Yes it was a bit of a shock overall
that that ’s me, because I ’ve never looked at me. I don ’t
know if it ’s the right expression to say I ’m not interested
in me …..I tend to almost be an observer ….. I almost look
at that circle with me on the very outside ”(ID13)
P: Well I suppose I was surprised because I ’ve never
written them down like that, you don ’t do you? Your
friends and your family, they ’re there ….. but it ’s just a
bit of an eye opener when you do write them downand then you think it ’s a bit short really.
I: Is that what you thought?
P: Look like Billy no mates according to that! (ID12)
Combining this visual represe ntation with a conversation
with the facilitator about what the network members did to
help them manage their condition led to a re-alignment in
thinking about relationships .P e o p l ew e r ea b l et oe x p l o r e
the underlying dynamics within close family ties and what
this represented in terms of importance to them through
distinguishing between network members who either pro-moted or inhibited self-management support. The inter-
activity with the web tool allowed movement of network
members around the circles and from the outset this en-
couraged thinking about the possible reconstruction of
networks.
“…this [intervention] takes it to the next level ……
having this chat today got me thinking about, yes, nowwho among my friends and relatives might be able to
be a buddy? ”(ID4)
The mapping and discussio n about healthcare support
raised awareness of how frequently participants had contact
with a healthcare professional and in relative terms howseemingly unimportant they were in terms of self-management support in everyday life. As awareness grew of
social network support, the focus on medical-based solu-
tions for long-term condition management was revised.
“I think you are sort of left on your own, you get an
annual check and that ’s it. I think there should be
more ”(ID1)
Accounts also emphasised the relevance of ‘weaker ties ’
[11] such as occasionally seen social acquaintances who
did not immediately spring to mind as important network
members and were re-evaluated through collaborativediscussion. ID5 remembered an acquaintance with skills
who provided valued practical assistance and being able to
provide reciprocal emotional support was important.
“There ’s one I forgot to put, there ’s [friend 1], a master
plumber, pipe fitter and god knows what but if Iwanted the wash basin taps changed in the bathroom
he would be offended if I didn ’t ask him and he
wouldn ’t charge a penny for doing it. He ’s the bloke I
would turn to …and there ’s a reciprocal thing when his
marriage went on the rocks which absolutely stunned
him it was going that way and he came round andover a coffee he mulled it over ”(ID5)
Reconstruction of social support
The intervention focussed attention on possible alter-
natives for support through rehearsing different options
to the current situation and seeking new and enjoyableactivities. Local opportunities were tailored to prefer-
ences and displayed on a map. Often this knowledge
was new and unexpected. The network mapping exer-cise enabled people to readily consider who in their
network could help them take up or resume activities
or healthy behaviours. This consideration of ‘collective
efficacy ’ranged from practical notions —such as ID12
deciding to obtain dietary advice and measuring spoonsfrom her sister who had health expertise —to taking up
enjoyable activities with close family members.
“I suppose what [my wife] and I have talked about
is perhaps to try and maybe find somebody to do
ballroom dancing or something. It might be fun but
I mean the poor girl works her socks off and by thetime we ’ve finished in the evening she ’s
knackered. ….. if we can find the time then perhaps
try and do it, give it a go and see if we like it ornot”(ID15)
What this last quote highlights, is the element of nego-
tiation and time required before new activities can be
embarked on. This is considered in the following theme.Kennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 9 of 15
Change and reflections over time
Considerations of how relationships might be negotiated
to allow people to take up activities were evident in find-ings in the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Some people
only required the facilitation of an informational link to
identify and access appropriate community resources,but for most, there was a period of inner reflection and
a need to renegotiate relationships and develop differing
tactics for unforeseen problems (such as timetables atleisure centres not fitting with peoples ’lives and respon-
sibilities). Case study 1 illustrates this.
Case Study 1
Foregrounding and backgrounding as a means of
mobilising the network
The longitudinal approach to this study captured changes
in the perceived importance of support from individualnetwork members. Whilst some member positions
remained static between T1 and T2, others moved be-
tween concentric circles of the network diagram reflectingan increase or a decrease in importance at different time
points. Four cases indicated outward movement of health-
care professionals (two GP , one diabetic nurse, onephysiotherapist) demonstrating a shift in focus away from
healthcare based self-management support as engagement
in new activities and community resources increased.
Movement between concentric circles of friends
and family was dependent on the fluctuating needsof participants; extension of support as needs in-creased and contraction as needs decreased. Network
mapping over time captured the repositioning of net-
work members as they moved inwards, outwards andsometimes beyond the circle diagram completely.
Case study 2 provides an illustration of foreground-
ing and backgrounding of network members.
Case Study 2
Follow-up allowed the identification of how network
members saw themselves becoming more engaged in in-
tegrating activities into their everyday lives as well as
how making activities fit the responsibilities of existingrelationships could open up new horizons and oppor-
tunities. ID13 was partially sighted and dependent on his
partner driving him to activities, whilst important tohim, this dependency was stifling and other network
members recognised his need for a personal space. It
was a connection to his gym instructor (a weak tie) [11]which enabled this as he recognised that coming to the
gym session not only increased the participant ’s fitness
but also provided an opportunity for him to ‘be him-
self’and enjoy a time and space away from a partner
he felt dependent on. The gym instructor gave theJulie a 66-year-old married woman retired with her husband 5 years ago
to the Island where her father and her sister were living. She sees them
in a caring capacity on a regular basis. Her grown up children andgrandchildren live on the mainland. Since retirement Julie has takenup part-time voluntary work in a charity shop.Julie ’si d e n t i t yi sc l o s e l y
linked to helping and supporting other people. Constructive andreflexive engagement occurred over time rather than immediately.Preference elicitation and linkin g those preferences to relevant
network members formed an aspect of the process of reconstructing
new alternatives.
At T2, Julie demonstrated the navigation of her network and negoti-ated relationships within it in order to access preferred activities identi-fying collective activities with acquaintances which she attributed to
sustaining her motivation. Some activities were incorporated into
maintaining a supportive role towards her father and sister. Her fa-ther ’s nursing home was opposite a hotel with a swimming pool open
to the public all day with more flexible availability than the local leis-
ure centre. This provided Julie with an opportunity to combine visiting
her father with her preferred form of regular exercise. Similarly, Julieused to go line-dancing with a friend, but had to give it up when thefriend stopped going, as she relied on her friend ’sh u s b a n df o rt r a n s -
port. Julie identified a new line-dancing class located near to whereher sister lives with weekly visits to support her sister. In addition, Julienegotiated a way to continue attending Slimming World classes whenthe friend she usually went with stopped attending. When Julie heard
that her neighbour’ s sister attended a class closer to home, she asked
w h e t h e rs h ec o u l dg ow i t hh e ro nt h eb u s .
The passage of time allows Julie to review the value of her role in thelocal Diabetes Support Group, which was onerous and no longer ful-
filled her needs. Having an administrative role has kept Julie engaged
in the support group for longer than average, as the role of healthcondition support groups are often only important for a limited length
and a specific point in time. Julie decided it was time to step down
from her position on the committee which in turn freed up time to in-
crease her weekly voluntary hours in the charity shop.Susan a 51-year-old woman whose diagnosis with type 2 diabetes9 months ago, left her feeling shocked, anxious and alone. Susan placedher daughter in the inner circle at T1, as her main source of support.She helped with weight loss and fitness through collaborating with
healthy eating and accompanying her to the gym. As Susan lost weight
she says she grew in confidence and decided to change to anothergym when her favourite class was dropped so was no longer reliant onher daughter for the same level of support. At T2 interview, Susan
moved her daughter from the inner to the middle circle (background-
ing). Other examples of network members becoming less importantover time included the diabetes nurse and a Facebook group. Althoughthe diabetic nurse played an important role in the initial period follow-
ing diagnosis, the drop off of frequency of appointments left Susan feel-
ing disappointed and abandoned. Susan decided to move the diabetesnurse from the inner circle (T1) to the middle circle (T2). Likewise, Susantalked about being a member of a Facebook based diabetes support
group (T1), but then got annoyed by the group which she described as
American-centric and not very ‘uplifting ’. This group was backgrounded
from the middle to the outer circle.In contrast, Susan placed her partner in the middle circle (T1). She felt
that he did not really understand the impact of her recent diagnosis
and wanted him to show more interest in her condition and get moreinvolved in her support. At T2, Susan moved her partner from themiddle circle to the inner circle to reflect an increase in support
(foregrounding). Susan felt that she was able to talk more openly
with her partner as her confidence grew, resulting in him becomingmore aware, involved and supportive. They are working towardsdoing exercise together and attending a ‘Sugar Buddies ’social
evening as a couple.Kennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 10 of 15
participant confidence to increase his sessions to
twice a week. At T3, his time at the gym was still
valued highly —“it’s brilliant ”.In this interview, he
opened up explaining that the gym is ‘me time ’away
from his partner. He compared going to the gym to asocial club with everyone chatting and joking in a re-laxed way. He commented: “it is ME having the con-
versation. She (partner) can ’tj o i ni n ”.
An illustration of fitting change with relationship
responsibility is provided by ID07, a carer for a dis-
abled partner. ID07 had started doing table tennis on
a weekly basis at T2, a sport she used to do 45 yearsago. It worked particularly well because the sports
centre was so close to home allowing her to leave her
p a r t n e ro nh i so w nf o ra nh o u r . “It h i n kt h a ti fi t
was too far away I ’d probably think ‘Oh, I can ’tb e
bothered. But because it ’so nt h ed o o r s t e pi t ’sa l l
there. ”Two further activities stemmed from this —a
Pilates session advertised at the sports centre and set-
ting up a team with other table tennis players to take
part in a local quiz night.
“It’s useful to see that one thing leads to another.
The intervention led to talking to (health trainer),a n dt h e nt a l k i n gt o( h e a l t ht r a i n e r )l e dt os e e i n gt h e
poster and that led to the table tennis and now
that ’s going to lead on to Pilates. So there is a
general progression. So yes, I have benefitted quite a
bit……..That has happened and you can quite easily
track it from one to the other to the other. And here
I am talking to you, looking at charts and things ……
I think overall the whole thing has been a benefit ”
ID07
The next theme explores how the role of the facilitator
was a key part of the process.
It has opened doors: importance of a challenging,
temporary friend
The intervention made ‘a lot of sense ’to the facilitators
because it fitted so well with their role in providing a
bridge between healthcare professionals and take-up of so-
cial and health-related activities and made their work eas-
ier. Feedback from the health trainers included theobservation that the intervention ‘felt like part of the ser-
vice ’. The care navigators went on to use the GENIE
circles tool with the majority of their clients as they wereparticularly interested in identifying people who were iso-
lated and lonely. Comments from their report included:
The scoring tool originally did not take into accounttelephone and skype calls which can be very important
to people. We have now decided to add telephone callsto the network typology.It does not capture that there are some people who
come out on the tool as being diverse as they attend
many social groups but when they come home theystill feel lonely.
It does not recognise professionals who come to be
important for them, for example carers who they

O rt h ep o s t m a nw h ow i l la l s oc o l l e c tt h em i l kf r o mthe local shop.
The facilitators were recruited from local populations
to represent ‘the person next-door ’. The perceived lack
of status difference present ed an opportunity for the
facilitator and participant to work together and collab-orate at each stage in order to find the most appropri-
ate way forward. Although the facilitator often took the
lead, participants played an active role in helping tonavigate the intervention ’s unfamiliar territory. Personal
dynamics and the level of confidence in certain tasksimpacted on how the balance of control shifted be-tween facilitator and participant, since the equalising
effect also opened up freedom to challenge and be chal-
lenged. For example, one participant felt very confidentwhen tackling IT-related issues due to his professional
training and wanted to help the facilitator whenever
technical difficulties arose.
“You ’ve gone too high …..no just close that ……that ’s the
problem with it going to full screen, with the wayyou ’ve got it set up ……when you clicked finish it didn ’t
either close down the questions or take you to the nextpage ….it didn ’t take you to step three …”(ID04).
Findings indicated that the human presence of a facili-
tator increased focus, motivation and persistence andelicited a more honest response.
“I think for me personally, having somebody else
there …It h o u g h t ,I ’ve got to think about the
answers. Whereas, I think if I was doing it on myown I ’d have just put that down and that ’si t ,t h a t ’s
done and put it away now and forget about it. ……
with [facilitator] being there I had to think about the
answers and make sure I was ….. I feel I was giving her
an honest answer ”(ID14)
Facilitators had ongoing working relationships be-
yond the point of intervention with nine participantswho became or were existing clients. These facilita-
tors were often included as network members in the
circle diagram at T2 and considered personal friends
or‘buddies ’. However, facilitators were expected to
have between six and eight visits with each clientKennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 11 of 15
resulting in potential blurred professional/personal
boundaries when associations continued beyond those
sessions.
“[Facilitator] she’s a good friend and it ’s nice to have
that support ….. I never get to see [her] much because
she’s such a busy lady, isn ’t she? I do tell her to come
round and she has been round a couple of times butlately she ’s gone off the boil. Well, I think with
Christmas and New Year and that she ’s such a busy
lady. It ’s trying to fit it all in ”(ID10)
By T3 the ‘removal of the training wheels ’was more
apparent. Whilst some like ID10 mourned the loss of atemporary friend, others such as ID04 recognised theneed to become less reliant on the facilitator and to
begin to mentally move her out of the inner circle thus
enacting ways to deal with the loss of network member.Visualising and using the circles became important to
him as a way to plan:
“I’m thinking about other groups, I ’m thinking about
how to take it forward from where I am. How I can
progress into the future. Getting back to work at themoment is in the outer circle but I need to bring it into
the middle circle or into the inner circle. …..these ideas
are in the outer circle but it ’s how they progress
towards the inner circle …..I’ve got these networks and
I’ve got to sort of start moving them around, making
some more important than others and not making
myself reliant on somebody. Making myself reliant on
myself or looking at going out to parties, this sort of
thing, getting myself back into a social environment ”
Lessons learnt about GENIE delivery
One intention of the study was to record frequency offace-to-face contact with network members. However,
the importance of Skype, FaceTime and telephone con-
versations as valued means of regular contact with closefriends and family was not fully anticipated and will
need to be considered in the future. An unanticipated
finding was the value attached to ‘things ’in the network
mapping exercise. Participants placed objects such as
walking sticks, mobility scooters, phablets, monoculars,
measuring spoons and Wii-fit games as important net-work ‘members ’in terms of self-management support.
Health-related objects such as these become built in sus-tainable ways into people ’s everyday life. In addition,
everyday workable objects represent a means of en-
gaging people without involving written information,
which has important implications in terms of healthliteracy.
Lessons learnt about facilitator training suggested a
need to place more emphasis on discussing preferenceoptions in the final stage of the intervention, since facili-
tators spent most time on the first stage (network map-
ping). As the network mapping exercise was so readilyincorporated into people ’s life and work, it may be worth
considering the different elements of the tool as stand-alone interventions.
From the data analysis presented the following process
seemingly underpins and characterises how GENIE be-comes implementable:
1.Positive disruption of established self-managementpractice through engaging with network map.
2.Reflection on existing network membership opens up
possibilities for evaluating the present andanticipating, rehearsing and reconstructing self-management differently.
3.Preference construction and elicitation are an aspect
of the process of reconstructing self-management(establishing preferences of things they would like to
do and asking about activities they like that they
have stopped doing).
4.Reversing the focus on the self to focus on others in a
network assists with reflexion and option appraisalthat moves beyond individual motivation andexisting personal option appraisal.
5. This is enabled through constructive interpersonal
engagement provided from facilitation where there is
perceived lack of status difference (less likely if the
facilitators are medics) and the possibility of
reciprocity within the discussion (e.g., helping thefacilitators to deal with the technology, telling them
about groups that are not in the database).
6.Access to definitive resources which can be
approached via a reliable database of local resourcesis a precondition for elicitation and moving to
connecting to and mobilising broader social capitaland self-management options.
Discussion
This study illuminates the likely mechanisms underpin-
ning the workability of a resource to improve awareness
of the nature and potential role of social networks forpeople with long-term conditions. Key factors relating to
health literacy (visualisation in network mapping and
findings phase) and ‘fit’with lay health worker roles
differentiate GENIE ’s approach from similar interven-
tions. There is a known gap between development ofideas and products and implementation in real-worldsettings which has been termed the second translational
‘gap’[29] (the first gap being that between basic research
and products). The GENIE approach goes some way to
effectively addressing this as the network mapping phase
of the intervention is immediately translated intoKennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 12 of 15
practice by the trained facilitators and utilised with each
new client.
Our findings suggest that GENIE works through
increasing links to and uptake of social activities. Im-plemented across a health community, it was found
acceptable and appropriate for people living with type 2diabetes when delivered by trained facilitators in a com-
munity setting. Implementation led to an increase in
diversity of participants ’networks, greater engagement
with community activities and adoption of GENIE by
facilitators as part of their routine client assessment.
In contrast to delivery in primary and secondary care
settings, health trainers and care navigators embody anethos that fits and complements GENIE ’s composition in
terms of collaborative work, user-centred approach and
forging links to community resources [13]. Using face-
to-face facilitation provided the means for a stronger
interpersonal element to develop within the collectivework carried out. The equal relationship with lack of sta-
tus difference was instrumental in allowing this, and fa-
cilitation has been shown to be an important aspect ofGENIE to support the navigation of options [30].
For people with long-term conditions, the social network
approach is a different way of considering the support theyhave. The building of individual and network capacity is
needed to navigate and negotiate relationships and health-
related environments to gain self-management support andfindings in this study parallel the elements of navigation,
negotiation and collective efficacy identified in an earlier re-
view [4]. Findings from this st udy illustrate the cyclic and
temporal nature of network relationship negotiation which
requires persistent cognitive and emotional effort to gener-
ate collective efficacy. We have shown that engagementwith the circle diagrams provides a means of mobilising
resources that people can intuiti vely transpose into real-life
relationships in order to help them prioritise and make best
use of available support. This new way of thinking —that
illness management is more about network relationships
and support than personal responsibility —disrupts existing
patterns of coping in a non-t hreatening but powerful way,
enhanced by having a visual network image which peoplecan control and alter to help them reflect and take actions
to form a more desirable support network. Externalisation
which does not focus on the self exclusively enables reflec-
tions that are missed or inhibited through introspections.
The longitudinal aspect of this study allowed us to capture
this change for example, health professionals had less of acentral role and weak ties and enjoyed activities came more
to the fore.
Being able to see a support network mapped out helps
to open up discussions about support and facilitatorsfound this a shortcut to forming a working relationship.
It is recognised that people are sometimes overwhelmedwith choice which is often only apparent and notactionable, or they do not know where or how to look
for support. The multiplicity of databases produced by
governmental and health-related organisations is testa-ment to ongoing attempts to provide information about
resources and groups —alongside which, there is a growth
in new roles for lay people in health-related jobs such as
health trainers, care navigators, health coaches, link
workers, pathway planners who work to provide a bridge
between primary care professionals and social activities[26]. GENIE provides a way of assisting those in this role
to help make sense of the choices and availability of sup-
port and work with people ’s preferences and interests to
get them to engage with their local community.
Earlier studies have demonstrated that networks are
built and evolve through a process of selection of similarties (homophily) which are likely to be preferred and
sustained over time [31]. Existing contacts are likely to
influence and reinforce choices in a process described ascontagion operating through replicating practices, mod-
elling on others, upward and downward comparisons
[32, 33]. The GENIE intervention builds on these net-work mechanisms facilitating the process of selection
through the identification of new ties. Engagement with
community resources can have an indirect effect on self-management and opportunity to reciprocate making
further engagement more likely. However, with GENIE,
there is recognition that key network ties need to bemade visible and reflected upon, so both users and their
network members can negotiate what is valuable and ac-
ceptable [4].
Limitations
Results are not generalisable on the basis of health con-dition or location. The exemplar long-term condition
used for the study is type 2 diabetes; therefore, validity
of findings in relation to other chronic illness manage-ment outcomes is limited. The study is located in an
island community comprising a number of distinct in-
herent features such as geographical marginalisation(families separated by the sea), above national average
elderly population living alone and at risk of isolation
and a predominantly white British population [34].Video-elicitation did not work well as a method due to
technical complexities, the method was adapted success-
fully through use of researcher observation notes toelicit ‘thinking aloud ’associated insight.
Conclusions
GENIE is an evidence-based health intervention which
can help to change people ’s established way of thinking
about self-management support and offers a route to
change practice and behaviour patterns in everyday life.
The intervention achieves this by raising awareness of so-
cial networks, using social networks to engage people inKennedy et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:27 Page 13 of 15
reflection of their support and access to further resources
and by improving patient engagement through strength-
ening existing individual and community networks. Theintervention ‘fit’with real-world environments and the
working remit of community-based lay health workerspoints to potential for adoption and integration intohealthcare policy and practice.
