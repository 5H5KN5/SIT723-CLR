Abstract
Background: Few implementation strategies have been empirically tested for their effectiveness in improving
uptake of evidence-based treatments or programs. This study compared the effectiveness of an immediate versus
delayed enhanced implementation strategy (Enhanced Replicating Effective Programs (REP)) for providers at Veterans
Health Administration (VA) outpatient facilities (sites) on improved uptake of an outreach program (Re-Engage) among
sites not initially responding to a standard implementation strategy.
Methods: One mental health provider from each U.S. VA site ( N= 158) was initially given a REP-based package and
training program in Re-Engage. The Re-Engage program involved giving each site provider a list of patients with
serious mental illness who had not been seen at their facilit y for at least a year, requesting that providers contact
these patients, assessing patient clinical status, and wh ere appropriate, facilitating appointments to VA health
services. At month 6, sites considered non-responsive ( N= 89, total of 3,075 patients), defined as providers updating
documentation for less than <80% of pa tients on their list, were randomized to two adaptive implementation
interventions: Enhanced REP (provider coaching; N= 40 sites) for 6 months followed by Standard REP for
6 months; versus continued Standard REP ( N= 49 sites) for 6 months followed by 6 months of Enhanced REP for
sites still not responding. Outcomes included patient-level Re-Engage implementation and utilization.
Results: Patients from sites that were randomized to recei ve Enhanced REP immediately compared to Standard
REP were more likely to have a completed contact (adjusted OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.09 –4.19, P= 0.02). There were
no differences in patient-level utilizatio n between Enhanced and Standard REP sites.
Conclusions: Enhanced REP was associated with greater Re-Engage program uptake (completed contacts)
among sites not responding to a standard implementatio n strategy. Further research is needed to determine
whether national implementation of Facilitation res ults in tangible changes in patient-level outcomes.

Background
There are substantial delays between the time that treat-
ments are proven effective and when they are routinelyimplemented in practice. This research-to-practice gap
is especially pertinent to the delivery of treatments for
persons with serious mental illness (e.g., schizophreniaor related disorders, bipolar disorder), which are associated
with substantial functiona l impairment, medical burden
[1-3], health costs [4,5], and premature mortality [6-11].
There has been growing interest in developing and
testing implementation strategies that more rapidly and
effectively translate programs into routine care settings[12]. Implementation strategies are operationalized tech-
niques based on an underlying framework or theory that
are designed to enhance the uptake of effective programsacross different health-care settings [13]. A variety of im-
plementation strategies and supporting frameworks exist
[14-18], with relative advantage conferred on those thatare (a) theory-based, (b) described in highly specified op-
erational terms, and (c) applicable across different care
settings.
Replicating Effective Programs (REP) is a previously
operationalized implementation strategy based on the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’sR e s e a r c h - t o -
Practice Framework [16,17, 19]. Derived from Social
Learning Theory [20] and Rogers ’diffusion model [21],
REP consists of three central operational components:program “packaging ”(i.e., translation and dissemination of
treatment materials into user-friendly language), struc-
tured training for providers, and brief technical assistancefor providers focused on the technical aspects of program
implementation. These three components in combination
compared to package dissemination alone resulted in im-proved uptake of HIV prevention intervention programs
in AIDS service organizations [19,22].
Although REP employs key tactical strategies that can
promote treatment adoption [19,23], it is likely inadequate
for more complex programs that involve more than a
single behavioral intervention or provider. Notably, carefor persons with serious mental illness is often managed
across different provider and o rganizational boundaries
that can make implementation challenging [24]. More-
over, competing demands on providers and the need to
garner support from multiple levels of providers andleaders require implementation strategies beyond train-
ing, such as coaching in strategic thinking to enable
leadership support and adap tation across sites [25-27].
Hence, REP was recently enhanced to address provider
and system-level barriers to adoption [16] by including
additional strategies that engage both service leaders andfrontline providers [28,29]. Enhanced REP includes on-
going Facilitation based on the Promoting Action on
Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS)framework [23,30-32]. Faci litation is a systematic anditerative process in which t echnical experts promote
p r o g r a mu p t a k eb yb u i l d i n g relationships with pro-
viders and working with them to identify and mitigatebarriers to program adoption, often using one-on-one
consultation by phone [28,33]. Facilitation was chosen
as additional implementation strategy to REP becauseof its relative feasibility in application across a national
network of sites, as well as similarity in theoretical
underpinning to other imple mentation strategies that
focus on improving the uptake of psychosocial inter-
ventions [34,35].
In a previous study, Enhanced REP with added Facili-
tation compared to Standard REP was associated with
improved fidelity to an effective mental health collabora-
tive care program in community-based practices [36].However, this study did not address key questions that
would inform a larger rollout of Enhanced REP, notably,
whether adding Facilitation to sites that are initially non-responsive to Standard REP and whether more immedi-
ate versus delayed implementation of Facilitation lead to
improved program uptake.
This current study reports 12-month findings from a
national cluster randomized intervention study comparing
two adaptive implementation strategies among sites thatare initially non-responsive to Standard REP: one provid-
ing Enhanced REP immediately versus another delaying
the provision of Enhanced REP only for sites that remainnon-responsive 6 months later. The primary outcome was
uptake of an outreach program for patients with serious
mental illness (SMI). The program, Re-Engage, involvedmental health providers identifying Veterans with SMI
who had dropped out of care (i.e., not seen by a provider
for at least 1 year), documenting their current status, andproviding outreach to assess clinical need and to schedule
health-care appointments if needed. Developed by the
Veterans Health Administration (VA), Re-Engage was as-sociated with improved access to care and reduced mor-
tality in a previous effectiveness trial [37]. Re-Engage
became a nationally mandated program in the VA in Janu-ary 2012 [38] and hence, provided an ideal opportunity in
which to compare the effectiveness of Enhanced and
Standard REP on its uptake and patient outcomes.
The study ’s primary hypothesis is that among patients
from non-responsive sites, those from sites randomizedto the adaptive intervention Enhanced REP for 6 months
followed by Standard REP would be more likely to re-
ceive Re-Engage program components within 12 monthscompared to those from non-responsive sites random-
ized to continue Standard REP for 6 months and then
receiving Enhanced REP after 6 months (for sites thatremain non-responsive). Implementation of Re-Engage
program components was defined as updated documen-
tation of patients ’current status in a web-based registry,
attempts to contact the patient (i.e., attempted contact),Kilbourne et al. Implementation Science  (2014) 9:163 Page 2 of 12
and successfully contacting the patient (i.e., completed
contact). Secondary aims of the study included assessing
differences in patient utilization occurred between theadaptive interventions.
Methods
The rationale and protocol for this two-arm cluster ran-
domized controlled implementation trial has been de-
scribed elsewhere [39]. This study was reviewed andapproved by the local Institutional Review Board and was
registered as a clinical trial (Current Controlled Trials
ISRCTN21059161).
Setting
The study included all U.S. VA facilities (sites) that wererequired by the VA National Policy Directive [38] to assign
a designated VA mental health provider to implement Re-
Engage, with the adaptive implementation trial focusingon sites that did not initially implement Re-Engage in re-
sponse to receiving 6 months Standard REP alone.
Re-Engage treatment program
Described elsewhere [37,40], Re-Engage is a national
VA outreach program that consists of risk assessment(i.e., identifying the patients ’current status including
clinical care needs and current disposition) and outreach
services (i.e., attempting to contact patients and invitethem back to receive health services). Re-Engage was
developed by VA Office of Medical Inspector to assist
patients with a diagnosis of serious mental illness (SMI;schizophrenia or related disorders, or bipolar disorder)
who had dropped out of care to re-connect to health
services if needed. In a previous national quality im-provement study, 72% of Veterans with SMI who had
not been seen in care for at least 1 year returned for VA
care. The mortality rate of returning patients was sig-nificantly lower than that for patients not returning to
care (0.5% versus 3.9%; adjusted odds ratio = 5.8; P
< .001), after demographic and clinical factors were con-trolled for in the analyses [37,40]. As a result, VA leader-
ship desired to have the Re-Engage program rolled out
via a National Directive as part of standard care, and thegoal of testing implementation strategies (i.e., Facilitation)
was to ensure that the program was implemented as
intended in this national rollout [38].
Re-Engage target population and site eligibility
For this study, the unit of the implementation strategyintervention was the site. Initially, the responsibility for
implementing Re-Engage was the designated mental health
provider at each eligible VA site (Local Recovery Coordin-ator) [41]. Local Recovery Coordinators are social workers,
psychologists, nurses, physicians, or marriage and family
therapists, but at the time of this study, the vast majority(96%) of them were licensed social workers or psycholo-
gists, and less than 4% were other health professionals
(two were Physician Assistants and three were Physicians).
A VA facility (site) was eligible for the current trial if it
was included in the national VA Re-Engage program.
VA sites were included in the national Re-Engage pro-gram if they were 1) within the 50 United States or
Puerto Rico, 2) were required, per VA policy [41], to
have a Local Recovery Coordinator to implement the na-tional Re-Engage Directive, and 3) had at least one VA
patient diagnosed with an ICD-9 diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia or related disorder or bipolar disorder who waslost to care. Lost to care was defined as whether the pa-
tient had been seen at the facility between fiscal year
(FY) 2008 –2009 but had no subsequent outpatient visits
or an inpatient stay of less than 2 days as of January 2012.
There were a total of 158 sites eligible for Re-Engage, of
which 139 were medical centers (i.e., with hospital beds)and 19 were community-based outpatient clinics.
Cluster randomized implementation intervention trial
procedures
Re-Engage was implemented based on the following steps.
First, all eligible sites received Standard REP for 6 monthsto support the implementation of Re-Engage starting
March 1, 2012, when VA disseminated the National Dir-
ective [38]. Standard REP included disseminating the listof veterans identified as having dropped out of care along
with a package that included a web-based clinical registry
in order to document patients ’current status and their
attempts to contact the patient, and instructions for
providing Re-Engage outreach services. The Local Re-
covery Coordinator at each eligible VA site received alist of names and last known contact information of eli-
gible veterans from the VA national mental health pro-
gram office who had dropped out of care and were lastseen at their site. Veterans who were eligible for Re-
Engage [37,42] and who were on the providers ’list 1
had at least one diagnosis of schizophrenia or relateddisorder (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes
295.0 –295.4; 295.6 –295.9), or bipolar disorder (ICD-9-
CM codes 296.0 –296.8) recorded in an inpatient or out-
patient visit in FY 2008 or FY 2009, 2) had not been
seen in VA care for at least 1 year (i.e., dropped out ofcare: defined as no recorded outpatient visits in the past
year), 3) had at least one inpatient visit prior to drop
out, 4) were less than 65 years of age (i.e., less likely tobe in a nursing home or covered by Medicare services),
and 5) were still alive as of March 2012 based on currently
available mortality information from the VA BeneficiaryIdentification and Records Locater Subsystem, the Social
Security Administration Death Master File, and the
National Death Index [43].Kilbourne et al. Implementation Science  (2014) 9:163 Page 3 of 12
In addition to the list- and web-based registry, Local
Recovery Coordinators at each site also received a guide
describing the Re-Engage program and were providedtraining via conference calls and offered brief technical
assistance for 6 months [39]. During this period, Local
Recovery Coordinators were asked to identify and docu-ment their patients ’current disposition based on the
pre-generated list of those who had dropped out of care.
Specifically, providers attempted to contact patientsfrom the outreach list and if successfully contacted, as-
sess their clinical need and schedule a VA appointment
if the Veteran desired health care.
Sites with inadequate implementation of Re-Engage
(i.e., non-responding si tes) as of September 1, 2012were then identified based on a previously established
eligibility criterion for inadequate implementation of
Re-Engage and randomized to receive Enhanced REPor continue Standard REP from September 1, 2012
through February 28, 2013 (see Figure 1). Inadequate
implementation of Re-Engage was defined as having<80% of patients who were previously identified as lost
to care and were assigned to the given facility with an
updated documentation of current clinical status in theweb-based registry. This previously established meas-
ure is considered a core component of the Re-Engage
program because it is an indicator of whether the LocalRecovery Coordinator at each site reviewed the list to
assess clinical status and attempted to locate the patient.

This measure is also most likely impacted by individual
providers and could be directly addressed through imple-
mentation interventions. A cut-point of 80% was selectedbecause it is a standard definition used to determine
adequate adherence to practice guidelines [44]. No dif-
ferences in site characteristics were observed among theresponding and non-respondin g sites (Table 1). In addition,
a total of 3,075 patients were identified from the 89 sites
(mean number of patients per site = 36; SD = 25; range 4to 145 patients). Patients from non-responding sites were
slightly more likely to be older and have a diagnosis of
schizophrenia or related disorder (Table 1).
Randomization procedures
Sites having successfully implemented Re-Engage byAugust 31, 2012 continued to receive Standard REP(these sites are not part of the present study). Sites that
had not adequately implemented Re-Engage (i.e., non-
responding sites) were included in the present studyand were randomized at the regional level by integrated
service networks. In the VA health-care system, sites res-
ide within 21 regional VA integrated service networks(VISNs) representing the 50 United States and territories.
A total of 89 sites (56.3%) from 20 of the 21 VISNs were
non-responders to Standard REP support to implementRe-Engage (<80% of patients with updated documentation
of current status). The VISNs of these sites were stratified
by geographic region and randomized with equal prob-ability to two implementation interventions (Enhanced
REP or continued Standard REP described below). Among
the 20 regional networks (VISNs), 9 VISNs that included40 sites were randomized to begin with Enhanced REP

and 11 VISNs that included 49 sites were randomized to
continue with Standard REP.
We chose to randomize at the regional network level
(VISN) and not the site level because VISNs are typically
authorized to set policies including allocation of clinical
resources across VA facilities based on their own budget.Moreover, each regional network has a designated men-
tal health leader who is responsible for monitoring men-
tal health program activities among the network ’s
individual sites and who would likely be contacted as
part of the Facilitation implementation strategy (Table 2).
Hence, randomization was conducted at the regional net-work level in the event that individual providers interacted
with VISN-level leadership to garner support for the im-
plementation of Re-Engage at their site, thereby minimiz-ing potential for contamination across sites.
After an additional 6 months, sites in VISNs initially
randomized to receive Standard REP and who were stillnon-responsive (<80% documentation of patients ’currentstatus) received Enhanced REP Facilitation from March 1,
2013 through August 31, 2013, described below and in
Figure 1. Sites in VISNs that were initially randomized toreceive Standard REP and metthe implementation bench-
mark continued to receive Standard REP from March 1,
2013 through August 31, 2013. Sites in VISNs randomizedto receive Enhanced REP in the first 6 months received
Standard REP in the latter 6 months regardless of respon-
siveness. Note that while the two interventions beingcompared are adaptive (Enhanced versus Standard REP),
the experimental study design is not an adaptive design,
nor a cross-over design.
Adaptive implementation strategies
Adaptive implementation strategy 1: Standard REP ,d e -
scribed previously [37,42], consists of dissemination of
a Re-Engage package describing the program ’sc o r ec o m -
ponents, training the mental health providers implement-ing Re-Engage, and brief technical assistance offered to

program. Program materials made available on mental health provider website.
Technical assistance : Ongoing assistance via 1-h biweekly conference calls led by study staff for mental health providers
to answer technical questions on Re-Engage program implementation, and study staff were available on an ad hoc basis to
answer questions from individual providers. Monthly reports were generated to track Re-Engage uptake (% patients withupdated current status documented).

Garner local and regional support : Facilitators initiate contact with regional mental health leadership
affiliated with local sites, providing information regarding Re-Engage program implementation and added
value. Maintain ongoing contact and request support from regional leadership as indicated.
Identify barriers/facilitators to Re-Engage implementation : Facilitators and mental health providers
hold monthly calls for 6 months and collaboratively identify each facility ’s specific challenges (e.g., time,
resources) to program implementation as well as potential assets (e.g., consistency with other initiatives,
support from regional leadership).
Collectively develop action plans : Facilitators assist mental health providers in identifying what specific
actions they can take to implement program.
Feedback/link to available resources : Facilitators provide feedback to mental health providers regarding
implementation and action plan progress. Facilitators refer mental health providers to existing resources,including the Technical Assistance available through Standard REP, existing documents regarding the
program intervention, facility-level, regional, or national leadership.

mental health providers that was designed to answer ques-
tions about specific Re-Engage components (Table 2).
Training and technical assistance was provided throughregularly scheduled national phone calls between March
2012 and August 2012 by staff members from the investi-
gator team.
Adaptive implementation strategy 2: Enhanced REP in-
cluded the addition of Facilitation, which has been de-
fined as “a process of interactive problem-solving and
support that occurs in the context of a recognized need
for improvement and a supportive interpersonal rela-
tionship ”[45]. Since Re-Engage was to be implemented
nationally and is a relatively straightforward treatment
delivered primarily by one provider at each facility, an
External Facilitation role was based out of a central co-ordinating center [46]. Facilitation was delivered via tele-
phone contacts for 6 months by three doctoral-level
staff members with backgrounds in clinical psychologyor counseling and were trained in the VA ’sB l e n d e dF a c i l i -
tation Model [47]. Individual semi-structured calls were
made to the mental health providers at each facility, aswell as to leaders in the facility ’s regional network. Calls
lasted on average about 30 min and occurred approxi-
mately one to three times per month for each facility.
The primary goal of Facilitation was to support the
implementation of Re-Engage and included the following
specific components [48] described in Table 2. Facilita-tors first gathered information using various sources to
better understand the context of individual sites and
reviewed internal reports generated from the web-basedregistry on Re-Engage implementation. Facilitators then
scheduled individual calls with site providers to coach
them on the implementation of Re-Engage. In addition,Facilitators contacted and built relationships with mental
health leaders from the facility ’s regional VA network to
promote the Re-Engage program, support implementa-tion, identify potential barriers, and if the site mental
health provider desired, help resolve barriers to program
adoption. Finally, Facilitators worked with the site pro-viders on plans to overcome barriers to Re-Engage im-
plementation and continued to provide feedback.
Outcomes
Twelve-month outcomes assessed at the patient level in-
cluded Re-Engage implementation and utilization of VAhealth-care services. Re-Engage program implementation
was assessed using the three measures ascertained from
the web-based registry: updated documentation of pa-tients ’current status, attempted contact of the patient,
and completed contact. Updated documentation was
captured by determining whether the providers added incurrent information on the veteran ’s clinical and social
disposition based on the most recent VA medical record
entries as well as available information regarding theveteran ’s location and contact information via the inter-
net. Attempted contacts were also recorded by the pro-
viders in the registry if they tried calling the veteran,calling his or her next of kin if their contact information
was available, and if needed, sending a letter to the last
known address of the veteran. Completed contacts weredefined as documentation in the registry that the veteran
was successfully reached to determine preference and need
for services. All three measures involve clinical decision-making because the providers had to review clinical re-
cords in detail to understand the current disposition of the
veteran and their relative need for care based on currentsymptoms and health status. As part of these contacts,
providers were expected to make an immediate assess-
ment over the phone pertaining to safety, acute symptom-atology, or other clinical issue experienced by the veterans.
These processes are akin to primary care clinicians review-
ing medical records prior to a patient ’s visit, and using
available clinical data on diagnoses and past treatment
history, determine who needs to be seen sooner rather
than later.
Utilization outcomes post-randomization included any
inpatient or outpatient visit within 12 months of initial
randomization to Enhanced or Standard REP. Patientutilization data were ascertained from VA inpatient and
outpatient administrative data available at the national
level [49] using previously established methods [50,51].These methods allowed the research team to summarize
the total number of outpatient mental health and general
medical visits (based on 300 or 500 series VA stop codes,respectively) and any inpatient visit in the VA system. All
six patient-level outcomes —updated status, attempted
contact, completed contact, any outpatient, any inpatient,and any outpatient or inpatient visit —are dichotomous,
i.e.,“yes”versus “no”.
Analysis of primary and secondary aims
Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were con-
ducted to compare sites starting on Enhanced versus sitesstarting on Standard REP based on patient- and site-level
pre-randomization measures. For each outcome, we com-
pared Enhanced REP versus Standard REP overall and in6-month intervals (to account for immediate versus de-
layed effect of Enhanced REP) using a three-level mixed
effects logistic regression model that accounted for theclustering of patients within sites within VISNs [50]. All
regressions included an intercept, dichotomous indicator
for Enhanced REP versus Standard REP , and independentrandom intercepts for site and VISN (assumed to follow a
normal distribution). We further adjusted for the follow-
inga priori selected list of patient-level pre-randomization
covariates: patient age, gender, race, VA service connec-
tion, married, homelessness, schizophrenia or related
disorders diagnosis, number of medical comorbidityKilbourne et al. Implementation Science  (2014) 9:163 Page 7 of 12
diagnoses, and whether last encounter was inpatient, as
well as site-level factors including facility size (measured

The rationale for adjusting for these covariates is based
on prior data suggesting these factors are associatedwith responsiveness to the Re-Engage program based on
the original study [37]. For each outcome, we report
both the crude and covariate-adjusted odds ratios of a“yes”value.
Power calculations have been described previously [37]
and were originally based on a two-sample comparisonof facilities within VISNs randomized to Enhanced ver-
sus Standard REP. Assuming a between-VISN variation
(ICC = 0.177), and a two-sided, two-sample ttest based
on a type-I error rate of 5%, we had 80% power to detect
an effect size of 0.72 (Cohen ’s D). However, the current
study is a secondary analysis designed to identify poten-tial benefits of Enhanced REP based on multilevel
models. Notably, sample size calculations were not per-
formed for patient-level outcomes.
Results
By August 2012, 89 sites were identified as having <80%uptake (updated documentation of patients ’current status),
and these sites were randomized to Enhanced or Standard
REP. The average percentage of updated documentationacross the initially non-responsive sites ( N= 89) was 24.0%
(SD = 27.4%), and among the sites initially randomized
to Standard REP ( N= 49) was 22.6%; (SD: 28.1%) and
for sites randomized to continuation of Standard REP
was 25.1% (SD = 27.0%).
Among sites randomized to Enhanced versus Standard
REP, there were no significant differences in patient-level
characteristics with the exception that patients from En-
hanced REP sites were less likely Black and less likely tohave a diagnosis of schizophrenia or related disorder
(Table 1).
Multivariable results after adjusting for additional pa-
tient and site factors showed that there was a statistically
significant difference in Re-Engage program uptake when
Enhanced REP was applied immediately (Table 3). Inparticular, patients from non -responsive sites receiving
Enhanced REP in the first 6 months of randomization
compared to Standard REP sites were more likely tohave a completed contact (adjusted OR = 2.13; 95% CI:
1.09–4.19, P= 0.02). Delayed Enhanced REP was also
significantly associated with program uptake, where pa-tients from sites that were no longer receiving REP after
6 months were less likely to have their clinical status up-
dated compared to sites receiving Enhanced REP overthe 6 –12-month study period (Table 3). Enhanced REP
was not associated with statistically significant probability
of Re-Engage program uptake over the 12-month period,although the overall trend was increased program uptake
(Figure 2).
Overall, Enhanced REP was not associated with cumula-
tive differences in utilization after adjustment over the
12-month period.
Discussion
This paper describes to our knowledge one of the first
trials comparing two adaptive implementation interven-tions. The study tested the effectiveness of immediate
versus delayed deployment of Facilitation as an adjunct
to Standard REP on the implementation of a nationalVA program, Re-Engage, which is designed to assist pa-
tients with serious mental illness who have been lost to
care return to VA services. We found that among sitesinitially not responding to REP in 6 months, those that
were randomized at the regional network level to receive
Enhanced REP immediately (added Facilitation) or 6 monthslater were more likely to adopt Re-Engage. However, the
cumulative effects of Enhanced REP over the 12-month
period were not statistically significant.
To date, this was one of the first studies to employ an
adaptive implementation intervention. In doing so, we
were able to use a study design that took advantage ofthe national rollout of a clinical mandate. Although na-
tional mandates alone are limited in their ability to im-
plement programs due to their top-down nature [52-54]conducting the present trial in the context of a clinical
mandate provided additional support for the implementa-
tion of Re-Engage across sites [42]. Moreover, Re-Engageis one of the first brief interventions to be implemented
for people with serious mental illness at a national level,
using national data and web-based reporting registries todocument program uptake and patient status. Ultimately,
Standard REP and Enhanced REP were well-matched to
the implementation of Re-Engage because the compo-nents were designed to be employed across multiple sites
via internet and phone, which enhances the potential for
scalability. This approach also allowed for the rollout ofimplementation strategies on a national level, thus poten-
tially saving travel and personnel costs [55-58].
Nonetheless, we found that Enhanced compared to REP
did not result in an increased proportion of patients
returning to care or increased utilization of services
among those who had dropped out of care. There areseveral reasons for these findings. First, not all patients
were able to be contacted, and even fewer had a com-
pleted contact that would have routed them to services. Incontrast, over two thirds of patients in the original study
[37] were successfully contacted and re-engaged into ser-
vices. The length of time patients were lost to care wasKilbourne et al. Implementation Science  (2014) 9:163 Page 8 of 12
longer than in the present study (maximum of 4 years and
5 months) than the length of time lost to care in the ori-
ginal assessment (maximum of 3 years). In addition, thetime period for measuring return to care was longer in the
original study (2 years), while this study only examined 1-
year utilization outcomes. Perhaps patients who haddropped out of care longer ago were less likely to have
been found by providers. In addition, historical trends in
preference for VA care might have changed since the initi-ation of the original effectiveness study (2007 versus
2012). Perhaps patients who were reached may not have
desired care at the time of contact or had access to careexternal to the VA.Another reason for the null findings regarding utilization
may have been due to the randomization at the regional
network level as opposed to site level. The study was de-signed with the assumption that Facilitation involved con-
tacts with regional network leadership levels, which would
have made randomization at the site level vulnerable topotential contamination. Nonetheless, a key component of
Enhanced REP was the ability to coach individual pro-
viders in a relatively efficient manner (via phone calls) ra-ther than involving multiple levels of leadership and
frontline staff to implement quality improvement initia-
tives, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and oftenrequire buy-in from multiple stakeholders. The centralTable 3 Patient-level response to implementation of Re-Engage program comparing non-responsive sites randomized

aAdjusted odds ratios (OR) were obtained from multilevel hierarchical logistic regression models after adjusting for the effects of the following co variates: patient
characteristics (age, gender, race, marital status, VA service connection, homelessness, schizophrenia diagnosis, whether last encounter was in patient, number of
medical comorbidity diagnoses) and site characteristics (outpatient clinic status, facility size, and total number of patients on the original lis t). These models

underpinning of Facilitation is the ability to empower the
clinicians ultimately responsible for implementing a new
initiative. Hence, while Facilitation included contacts with
regional leadership in order to promote Re-Engage, in
reality, they were primarily focused on addressing con-
cerns brought up by the individual providers at each site,
especially regarding lack of time to contact patients and
difficulty in locating them [58]. Hence, the three-level
cluster analysis (VISN, site, patient) represented a more
conservative estimate of effects given more limited power
with 20 networks. Moreover, while it is possible that effect
of Facilitation might have been because of increased ad-
ministrative attention through leadership contacts, much
of this attention may have occurred prior to when Facilita-
tion was implemented because the national directive was
mandated and rolled out to VA regional mental health
leaders in March 2012, approximately 6 months prior to
initiation of added Facilitation (August 2012).
There are limitations to this st udy that warrant consider-
ation. We were unable to assess utilization of services out-
side the VA, as VA administrative data do not capture
other types of services such as state-run, not-for-profit, or
private community-based clinics or mental health pro-
grams. Although it would have been scientifically inform-
ative to have continued Enhanced REP for greater than
6 months, the rapid implementation of Re-Engage was a
high priority of VA leaders. Hence, the study was designed
so that all sites could have access to the potential benefits
of Enhanced REP in a relatively short period of time. Trans-
portation costs and the national cohort of VA sites pre-
cluded our ability to provide in-person REP components(e.g., training) or Enhanced REP Facilitation, which could
potentially have increased the potential impact of the im-
plementation strategies [33,59]. The national rollout of the
Re-Engage clinical program via a VA Directive precluded
our ability to measure provider behavior or other clinical
processes of care (e.g., qualitative assessments or taping
contacts with veterans). Fina lly, the Enhanced REP Facilita-
tion strategy was mainly focused the adoption of a relatively
straightforward clinical protocol, whereas a more compre-
hensive improvement strategy (e.g., systems engineering)
might be warranted for more complex health services inter-
ventions involving the adoption of care processes across
multiple interdisciplinary teams of providers [60,61].
Conclusions
Overall, Enhanced REP was associated with greater uptake
of an outreach program designed for patients with serious
mental illness among sites initially not responding to a
standard implementation strategy. Enhanced REP was
most effective when applied immediately among sites not
responding to a standard implementation strategy. Further
research is needed to determine whether national imple-
mentation of Facilitation results in tangible changes in
patient-level outcomes including utilization and quality of
care. Additional analyses regarding relative costs of en-
hanced implementation strategies are also warranted. Fi-
nally, adaptive implementation intervention designs may
hold promise in the more efficient allocation of imple-
mentation support notably for sites that are not responsive
to less intensive implementation approaches to facilitate
the uptake of evidence-based practices.
