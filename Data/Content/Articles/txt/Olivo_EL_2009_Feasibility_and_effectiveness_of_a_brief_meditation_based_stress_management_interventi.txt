Extensive research has led to the development of a psychobiological model of
cardiovascular disease. This model suggests that psychological factors such asdepression, anxiety, hostility, and stress may aﬀect the development and
progression of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent studies have also
demonstrated that meditation-based stress reduction programs are usefulinterventions for patients with various medical and psychological symptoms.
The objective of this pilot study was to gather preliminary information regarding
the feasibility of implementing a brief meditation-based stress management(MBSM) program for patients with CHD, and those at high risk for CHD, at amajor metropolitan hospital that serves a predominately non-local patient
population. The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that
such an intervention might reduce depression, as well as perceived stress, anxiety,and hostility, while improving general health scores. The overall feasibility resultsindicate that this MBSM intervention was highly feasible with regard to both
recruitment and retention of participants. In fact, 40% of patients requested
further training. In addition, after completion of the 4-week intervention,participants reported signiﬁcant reductions in depression and perceived stress. In
conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brief meditation-based stress
management program was well-received by patients and can successfully be usedas a supportive program for patients at risk or diagnosed with CHD.

Introduction
Heart disease is the number one cause of mortality in both men and women in the
US (American Heart Association, 2008). An increasing number of programs arebeing developed for disease prevention and early detection. Despite these newprimary and secondary prevention programs, there will be an increasing numbers ofpatients diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD) as the population ages.
A strong body of research has led to the development of a psychobiological
model of cardiovascular disease. This model suggests that psychological factors such

as depression, anxiety, hostility/anger, and stress may aﬀect the development of and
ultimately the progression of CHD. There have been several reviews of the literaturethat support this model in a more thorough way than is possible here (Rafanelli,Roncuzzi, Ottolini, & Rigatelli, 2007; Rozanski, Blumenthal, & Kaplan, 1999;
Rozanski, Blumenthal, Davidson, Saab, & Kubzansky, 2005).
Psychological factors, CHD, and cardiac events
DepressionNumerous studies have shown that depression is extremely prevalent in patients with
CHD. Prevalence estimates range from 14% to as high as 47% in patients with CHD
(Lett et al., 2004), with higher prevalence rates typically found in patients with
unstable angina or in patients awaiting CABG surgery. This high prevalence ofdepression in patients with CHD suggests that depression may contribute to thedevelopment of CHD. Several prospective studies’ ﬁndings have conﬁrmed thatdepressed individuals are more likely to develop CHD than non-depressedindividuals (Lett et al., 2004). In addition, depression has been shown to bepredictive of outcomes in patients with CHD. Patients with CHD with depressionhave a signiﬁcantly increased risk of cardiac death and adverse cardiac events (Lett
et al., 2004). Carney et al. (1995), identiﬁed depression as the best predictor of any
cardiac event (myocardial infarction, death, CABG surgery, or angioplasty)independent of the extent of CHD, smoking status, and left ventricular ejectionfraction. Patients with depression were found to be 2.2 times more likely toexperience a cardiac event than non-depressed patients (Carney et al., 1995).
Anxiety
Although there have been fewer studies investigating the relationship between
anxiety and CHD, there is evidence that suggests that anxiety may also impact thedevelopment of CHD in healthy individuals (Booth-Kewley & Friedman, 1987;Pignay-Demaria, Lesperance, Demaria, Frasure-Smith, & Perrault, 2003;Weissman, Markowitz, Ouellette, Greenwald, & Kahn, 1990). Likewise, there issome evidence that supports the hypothesis that anxiety may inﬂuence outcomes inpatients with CHD (Gullette et al., 1997; Pignay-Demaria et al., 2003). Speciﬁcally,phobic anxiety has been found to be a risk factor for sudden cardiac death
(Rozanski et al., 2005).
Hostility/anger
Numerous studies have explored the link between hostility and chronic anger and
CHD. Positive studies have shown an association between chronic anger/hostilityand cardiac events, speciﬁcally in regards to the progression of atherosclerosisduring serial coronary angiography/carotid ultrasonography (Rozanski et al., 1999,
2005). Other studies have demonstrated that type A behavior (characterized by
hostility) may double the risk of CAD and increase the risk of myocardialinfarction (MI) ﬁvefold over an 8.5-year follow-up (Rozanski et al., 1999). Angerlevels have also been linked to the frequency of recurrent cardiac events (Rozanskiet al., 1999).514 E.L. Olivo et al.
Chronic stress
Research has shown that chronic stress plays a signiﬁcant role in the development of
heart disease. Exposure to chronic stress may negatively aﬀect cardiac health directly
through neuroendocrine mechanisms or as a result of its link to unhealthy behavior
and other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, smoking, and physical inactivity(Macleod et al., 2002). Additional research is needed in order to clarify themechanism by which chronic stress acts as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
Various life stressors can lead to chronic states of stress, such as work stress,
socioeconomic status (SES) marital stress, and caregiver stress. Work-related stresshas been extensively researched due to its frequent causal relationship to CAD.Studies have shown that this type of stress is related to an increased frequency of
adverse cardiac events (Rozanski et al., 1999, 2005).
Behavioral and integrative interventions in heart disease
In a meta-analysis of cardiac related psycho-educational programs, 37 studies were
reviewed that utilized interventions such as health education and stress management(Dusseldorp, van Elderen, Maes, Meulman, & Kraaij, 1999). The programs revieweddemonstrated a 34% reduction in cardiac mortality and a 29% reduction in recur-
rence of myocardial infarctions. In addition, a number of clinical trials have inves-
tigated the impact of interventions speciﬁcally targeting depression in cardiac patients.The results of the well-known SADHART (Glassman et al., 2002) and ENRICHD(Jaﬀe et al., 2006) trials have demonstrated the beneﬁts of using selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating depression in patients with cardiac disease.
Research investigating the use of integrative therapies in cardiac patients is
dominated by the studies of Ornish et al. (1998). Ornish investigated the eﬀectivenessof a lifestyle program which includes meditation training, a low-fat vegetarian diet
and exercise, and has demonstrated beneﬁcial outcomes for participants (Gould
et al., 1995; Ornish et al., 1998). Further research is needed to isolate the eﬀectivenessof meditation alone in addressing the psychological risk factors associated withcardiac disease.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the
Stress Reduction Clinic of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (Kabat-
Zinn, 1990), is one of the most well studied meditation and stress managementprograms. MBSR is a clinical behavioral medicine program that provides systematicmindfulness meditation training to a population with a wide range of chronic medicaland stress related disorders (Bowen et al., 2006; Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, &Walach, 2004; Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, & Burney, 1985; Kristeller,1999; Miller, Fletcher, & Kabat-Zinn, 1995). The standard program is comprised ofeight weekly group sessions that meet for two and a half hours. These sessions consist
of mindfulness meditation and gentle Hatha yoga training, as well as psycho-
educational discussions about stress and coping. Homework assignments are giveneach week to incorporate mindfulness practice into everyday life (Kabat-Zinn, 1990).
Research suggests that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programs are useful
interventions for patients with various medical and psychological symptomsPsychology, Health & Medicine 515
(Grossman et al., 2004). Various institutions have adapted the MBSR model to
create eﬀective population-speciﬁc interventions for the treatment of depression,anxiety, chronic pain, substance abuse, and eating disorders (Bowen et al., 2006;Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992; Kristeller, 1999; Miller et al., 1995).
Numerous controlled and uncontrolled studies have demonstrated the eﬃcacy of
MBSR-based interventions for a broad range of chronic disorders and conditions(review articles: Baer, 2003; Bishop, 2002).
Although there have been numerous studies that have investigated the cardiac
speciﬁc physiological impact of various forms of meditation, to date there has onlybeen one randomized trial that has investigated the eﬀectiveness of MBSR inimproving psychological outcomes in a cardiac population. Tacon, McComb,Caldera, & Randolph (2003) conducted a very small trial of a full 8 week MBSR
program with female cardiac patients and found a signiﬁcant post-intervention
reduction in anxiety. No improvements were found in health locus of control or ameasure of coping.
Method
ObjectivesThe objective of this pilot study was to gather preliminary information regarding the
feasibility of implementing an abbreviated Mindfulness-Based Stress Management
program for patients with CHD, and those at high risk for CHD, with regard topatients’ level of interest, and availability. A secondary aim was to investigate thepossibility that such an intervention might reduce depression, as well as perceivedstress, anxiety, and hostility, which may themselves be risk factors for other adversecardiac events. Kabat-Zinn’s MBSR protocol was used as a model for ourMeditation-Based Stress Management (MBSM) program, but for the purposes ofthis study (a non-local patient population), we have shortened and adapted it to a
4-week course. The abbreviated intervention covered all of the same material of the
longer course but in less detail, allowing for shorter time spent on each skill taught.
Participants
The study population was drawn from patients at Columbia University Medical
Center. All patients were adults who had been diagnosed with CHD or who were athigh risk for CHD. Diagnosis of CHD included such diagnoses as coronary artery
disease, chronic heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery
bypass graft surgery (CABG), valve repair or replacement, heart transplant, and/oraneurysm. Patients at high risk for CHD were deﬁned as having any two of thefollowing empirically established risk factors: male 445, female 455, family
history of CHD, current cigarette smoker, hypertension, elevated total cholesterolwith low HDL and/or high LDL, and diabetes. Other eligibility criteria included:ability to give informed consent, English speaker, and no active psychosis ordementia.
Procedure
Participants were recruited through advertisements posted in the cardiology suites at
the Columbia University Medical Center. Cardiologists were also asked to inform516 E.L. Olivo et al.
their patients about the study. Patients who contacted the study coordinator were
evaluated for eligibility and given a detailed description of the study obligations.Patients who were interested and eligible gave informed consent in accordance withInstitutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines. Baseline demographic information was
collected prior to the beginning of the intervention. Study measures of depression,
anxiety, stress, hostility, medical symptoms, and overall quality of life were alsocompleted. Participants completed this battery of measures again at the completionof the intervention (4 weeks). Because of the pilot nature of this study nophysiological data were collected.
Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression
Scale (CES-D) (Radloﬀ, 1977). This self report scale has been found to haveexcellent internal consistency in patient samples ( a¼0.85). In the current sample, a
Cronbach aof 0.72 was found.
State anxiety was assessed by using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
(Spielberger, 1983). The state anxiety version of the STAI assesses situationalfeelings of anxiety. The STAI has demonstrated good convergent validity andinternal consistency. In the current sample, a Cronbach aof 0.76 was found.
Perceived stress was assessed by using the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen,
Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). This is a 10 item, psychometrically sound, globalmeasure of perceived stress. The PSS has adequate internal consistency and is highly
correlated (0.52– 0.076) with symptomological measures. A Cronbach aof 0.62 was
found in the current sample.
Hostility was assessed by using the MMPI based, Cook-Medley Ho Scale (Cook
& Medley, 1954). This scale has been widely used in research investigating the healthconsequences of hostility and has been shown to have good internal consistency(a¼0.8) and construct validity (Smith & Frohm, 1985). A Cronbach aof 0.87 was
found in the current sample.
Medical symptoms were assessed by using the Medical Symptom Checklist
(MSCL-90), a list of 115 possible medical symptoms a respondent might have
experienced as bothersome. The score is the total number of symptoms checked.While the reliability and validity of the MSCL have not been evaluated, it has beenwidely used in studies of MBSR and signiﬁcant reductions on the MSCL have beenfound (Kabat-Zinn, 1985; Kabat-Zinn et al., 1985). A Cronbach aof 0.8 was found
in the current sample.
Overall health was assessed by using the SF-36, a self report general health
measure (Ware, Snow, Kosinski, & Gandek, 1993). It yields an overall health index
score as well as psychometrically based physical and mental health summary scores.
This widely used measure has reported reliability estimates from 0.7 to 0.9. ACronbach aof 0.7 was found in the current sample.
In addition to these outcomes, information concerning the amount of time spent
on meditation practice was also collected. Participants ﬁlled out weekly diariesindicating the time spent on various meditation practices.
Intervention
All participants attended the 4-week long Meditation-Based Stress Management
Program at the Columbia University Medical Center. The program was taught byan MBSR instructor trained by the Kabat-Zinn team at the University ofMassachusetts, Center for Mindfulness. The intervention involves intensive trainingPsychology, Health & Medicine 517
in mindfulness meditation and its application in daily living. During the program
itself, participants were introduced to three formal meditation techniques: (1) aguided sitting meditation; (2) a guided body scan meditation; and (3) mindful Hathayoga, which involves a range of body postures.
In addition to the formal mindfulness practices, informal mindfulness practices
were also introduced. Informal practices include awareness of diﬀerent aspects ofdaily life experience such as breathing, walking, driving, cooking, eating, cleaning,showering, talking, listening, working, parenting, and playing. Informal mindfulnesspractices also include awareness of emotional states, thoughts, and perceptionsduring daily activities, as well as bringing awareness to particularly stressfulsituations, to options for responding to them mindfully, and to the tendency to reactautomatically and unconsciously, especially when under stress. Group discussion
focused on the meditation practices and their potential relevance to situations or
stressors in daily life. For homework, all patients were required to practicemeditation daily for at least 20 min per session. Guided meditation audiotapes and acardiac yoga video were provided during the course and were optional toolsprovided to assist participants with their home practice. The time, date, and durationof each meditation session was recorded in the meditation diary, along with anycomments regarding the practice. The meditation instructor was available by phoneto answer patients’ questions or concerns regarding any of the practices throughout
the duration of the intervention. During the ﬁnal class, the meditation instructor
worked with patients to develop strategies for continuing their meditation practicesat home. Patients completed post-intervention measures after the ﬁnal class.
Results
The primary aim of this exploratory study was not to test hypotheses about the
intervention’s eﬃcacy, but rather, to determine the feasibility and promise of utilizing
a brief Meditation-Based Stress Management program within this population.
Accordingly, data analysis regarding the primary aim was essentially descriptive.
Feasibility
The overall feasibility results indicate that this intervention was highly feasible. Fifty
patients were evaluated for eligibility and 35 consented for participation. Only 4participants dropped out of the intervention before its completion. Three of these
four participants dropped out after the ﬁrst class and cited scheduling conﬂicts as
their reason for dropping out. Of the 35 who consented to participate in the study,29% were male and 71% were female. The age of participants ranged from 34 to 76years with a mean age of 55.89 years. Forty percent (40%) of the participants werediagnosed with CHD and 60% of the participants were at high risk for developingCHD, as deﬁned above in the eligibility criteria. See Table 1 for the details of thesample demographics.
Adherence
Overall, participants were very adherent to the intervention and to the home
practice. Eighty-six percent (86%) of the participants attended all 4 of the MBSMclasses and reported that they practiced at least one of the meditation practices518 E.L. Olivo et al.
throughout the course. The amount of home meditation practice ranged from 20 to
487 min per week. On average, participants practiced meditation at home a total of147 min per week. Forty-three percent (43%) of the participants took part in anoptional full day retreat which occurred after the study period.Table 1. Demographics.

The secondary aim of this study was to assess the capacity of the meditation
intervention to positively aﬀect psychological and physical outcomes in patients with
CHD and those at high risk for CHD. The following outcomes were assessed using amixed model repeated measures analysis: perceived stress, anxiety, hostility,depression, and general health scores as measured by the PSS, STAI, Cook-Medley,CES-D, SF-36, and MSCL respectively. Age, gender, history of depression, andaverage weekly meditation practice were entered into the model as covariates. ThePROC MIXED procedure for SAS, was utilized for these analyses. PROC MIXEDis considered to be a better procedure than MANOVA as it does not delete cases
with missing observations; mixed models uses all available data whereas traditional
models can exclude a substantial proportion of data. Also, mixed models estimatethe variance as well as the mean. Estimates of the regression parameters achievehigher precision when the best-ﬁtting variance is used. Lastly, mixed models tend tobe more parsimonious than traditional models as they estimate only the essentialnumber of parameters and therefore make better use of the available degrees offreedom. See Table 2 for the descriptive statistics of these measures.
Of the above mentioned outcomes, depression ( t¼72.12, p¼0.04) and
perceived stress ( t¼72.22, p¼0.03) were signiﬁcantly reduced after the
intervention. Eﬀect sizes were calculated for these ﬁndings. There was a moderateeﬀect size for both depression (Cohen’s d¼0.54) and perceived stress (Cohen’s
d¼0.68), suggesting that a future randomized controlled trial with 80% power
would be highly feasible, requiring approximately 80–100 subjects. There were nosigniﬁcant diﬀerences found between baseline and post-intervention on the measuresof anxiety, hostility, medical symptoms, or overall health.
Discussion
The primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility of implementing a brief
Meditation-Based Stress Management program for patients with and at risk forCHD in an acute care setting. Many of the patients receiving medical treatment at520 E.L. Olivo et al.
the University Medical Center have to travel signiﬁcant distances due to the fact that
they live in the greater Metropolitan area and beyond. Thus, it is imperative toaddress feasibility issues when attempting to create an on-site intervention at apredominantly commuter hospital. At the conclusion of the pilot, it was evident that
the MBSM program was well-received by patients and was highly feasible. The four
classes were attended by both local NYC residents and by those who resided outsideof the NYC area and received primary care at other hospitals. Several of the non-local patients were willing to travel up to 2 h per day to attend this program. Patientsenrolled in this MBSM study demonstrated higher rates of attendance than had beenseen in other interventions oﬀered at the Columbia University Integrative MedicineProgram.
This pilot study shortened and adapted the standard 8-week Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction intervention to a 4-week program to encourage commuter patients
to attend. When participants were asked their opinion about the length of theprogram, they initially stated that a longer commitment would have been a deterrent.However, after completing the 4-week series, a great majority of the patientsexpressed that they would have been interested in continuing. These reportsindicated that in acute care settings, clinicians may attract more patients with shorterintroductory programs (i.e. 4-week interventions) that lead into more comprehen-sive, in-depth clinical programs.
Although the current study demonstrates good feasibility with regard to enrolling
and retaining participants, longer programs may be found to be more eﬀective inreducing stress and other psychological variables, as mindfulness practice is a way ofliving which is cultivated through consistent long-term practice.
The secondary aim of this study was to investigate whether a Meditation-Based
Stress Management intervention could reduce depression, as well as perceived stress,anxiety, and hostility, which may themselves be risk factors for adverse cardiacevents. As this pilot was not an RCT, there are limitations to the conclusions one can
make about the eﬀectiveness of the intervention; however, the results did
demonstrate signiﬁcant pre–post intervention reductions in stress and depression.Both perceived stress and depression were signiﬁcantly reduced after the interven-tion. These ﬁndings therefore suggest that this intervention has the potential topositively impact psychological well-being and could perhaps subsequently aﬀect theprogression of CHD. As stress and depression are largely ignored in acute cardiachospital settings, these ﬁndings are extremely important in regards to future researchand standard of care.
The ﬁndings of the current study did not show any statistically signiﬁcant
reductions in state anxiety scores. These results were unexpected as depression,stress, and state anxiety scores are often highly correlated. With additionalmeditation practice, and longer term follow-up, it is expected that anxiety mightultimately be reduced as were depression and stress levels.
The results of this study did not demonstrate any signiﬁcant changes in hostility
scores. These data were also unforeseen as meditation practice is often seen withinthe traditional Indo-Tibetan Buddhist context to be an intervention utilized to
regulate destructive emotions such as anger and frustration. One explanation of this
ﬁnding may be that only 4-weeks of MBSM training is insuﬃcient in inducingattitudinal changes suﬃcient to ameliorate hostility scores. The initial goal of anMBSM intervention is to teach individuals to attain mental stability and clarityfostered through attentional training which can be applied in both their meditationPsychology, Health & Medicine 521
practice and their daily lives. The next goal of an MBSM intervention is to help
individuals gain perspective and implement distance between themselves and theirpsychological experiences, such as thoughts and emotions. This type of perspectivetaking oﬀers the distance necessary to experience emotions, including hostility
producing triggers, without overreacting or exacerbating feelings of anger. Over
time, as individuals improve this ability to gain perspective and distance, it isexpected that hostility levels would be reduced. As mentioned, however, it is likelythat these ﬁndings/eﬀects were limited by the time and practice constraints of ourstudy. It is possible therefore that in a longer-term MBSM program, or in a laterfollow-up assessment, hostility may be found to be a CHD risk factor amenableto change.
There are limitations regarding whether the ﬁndings can be attributed to the
intervention itself as this pilot study was not an RCT. However, the results of this
study do show that meditation-based interventions could successfully be used aspreventative and supportive programs for patients dealing with various psycholo-gical and medical conditions, particularly CHD. While comprehensive, longer-termMBSM programs might lead to more signiﬁcant lifestyle and behavioral changes, theabbreviated intervention highlighted in this paper is an appropriate program for anacute medical population, such as a cardiac-surgery care center. The 4-weekintervention we have developed could serve as a model for inpatient care centers
nationwide.
