Abstract 
Background: Bedtime routines are highly recurrent family activities with implications for children’s wellbeing, devel-
opment and health.
Aims: The objective of this study is to co-develop and test in a feasibility, proof-of-concept study a bedtime routines 
intervention using text messages aimed at first-time parents with young children.
Methods: Fifty first-time parents with children aged 1–3 years were recruited for this study. Parents received a text 
message-based intervention for 7-consecutive nights which provided support and information on achieving optimal 
bedtime routines. Parents completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires focusing on children’s sleep, bedtime 
routines and parental mood disturbance. Feedback was provided at the end of the study.
Results: Recruitment target and high retention with 98%, or 49 out of 50 participants completing the study were 
achieved. Pre- and post-intervention, there were improvements in total children’s sleep with children sleeping longer 
and having less disrupted sleep overall (MD = − 7.77 (SD = 17.91), t(48) = − 3.03, p = .004, CI (− 12.91, − 2.63) and 
in overall quality of bedtime routines (MD = − 5.00, SD = 7.01, t(48) = − 4.98, p < .001, CI (− 7.01, − 2.98). Parental 
mood disturbance decreased pre- to post-intervention (MD = 5.87, SD = 15.43, t(48) = 2.66), p = .010, CI (1.44, 10.30). 
Parents provided positive feedback about the intervention and valued the support that was provided to them.
Conclusions: Bedtime routines were successfully altered with short-term benefits for children’s sleep and parental 
mood. Future research will need to utilize a more robust, longitudinal approach for a definite exploration of sustained 
changes in bedtime routines and their long-term implications for children and parents.

– Preliminary, changes were found pre- and post-
intervention on children’s sleep quality, bedtime 
routines quality and parental mood disturbance.
– Parents provided positive feedback regarding the 
intervention.
• What are the implications of the feasibility findings 
for the design of the main study?
– Minor changes to the intervention following feed -
back should take place before progressing to a 
larger study.
– A longitudinal study will be necessary to assess 
long-term changes in bedtime routines sustained 
over-time.
– Randomisation and inclusion of more metrics will 
be vital to showcase robust changes in children’s 
wellbeing and development as well as parental 
mental health and family functioning.
Background
Family life revolves around behavioural routines [1]. 
From morning to mealtimes to bedtime each family 
develops and implements their own routines and rituals 
that both complement their schedules and accomplish 
important tasks for the day [1]. Those routines might 
differ among families with some key similarities with 
regards to the behaviours that take place during these 
routines and rituals [2]. All family routines are essentially 
a series of behaviours [3], typically centred around par -
ticular time points or common activities.
From the wide range of routines and rituals within fam -
ily life, bedtime routines have particular importance for 
children, parent(s) and/or caregivers alike. Bedtime rou -
tines can be described as a series of activities that take 
place in the hour prior to bed [2, 4]. Optimal bedtime 
routines require a range of recurrent, adaptive and inter -
active behaviours to be consistently carried out by par -
ents and children [2, 5]; ideally including toothbrushing, 
avoidance of electronic devices including TV, avoidance 
of snacks and drinks other than water or unflavoured 
milk, reading of a book or storytelling between the par -
ent and the child, as well as other activities that promote 
positive interactions between parents and children [2, 
5]. Available research has highlighted the wide-ranging 
importance of bedtime routine behaviours for children’s 
wellbeing, development and health as well as for paren -
tal mood and wellbeing. Children with optimal routines 
tend to sleep better at night [6], have fewer problems at 
school the next day [5], score higher on tests of cogni -
tive functioning and school readiness [5], have less dental 
decay and dental disease [4, 7] and achieve better overall scores on key well-being, development and health meas -
urements [5]. As for parents, those in households with 
optimal bedtime routines for children report less stress, 
higher parental competence and confidence as well as 
more positive family functioning and even higher mar -
riage satisfaction [4, 8, 9]. Bedtime routines are not a 
silver bullet that can address all developmental, health 
and well-being issues for children and families. Never -
theless, there is an ever-increasing body of literature that 
highlights their broad importance and relevance to bet -
ter physical, mental and social outcomes for children and 
parents.
Given the importance of bedtime routines, it is vital 
to identify what methods and forms of support may be 
most effective for parents and/or caregivers to establish 
optimal routines. This is likely to be particularly impor -
tant for first time parents who have never had the need 
to develop and implement a bedtime routine for children 
before [10]. Previous research with first time parents has 
highlighted the importance of focusing resources and 
support on this particular group. Research from the Fam -
ily Nurse Practitioners program in the US and in the UK 
for example, has shown how important it is for first time 
parents in particular, to ‘learn something right’ when they 
first learn it [11]. Previous studies have reported success -
fully improving bedtime routines; however, most of these 
studies focused on time consuming and resource inten -
sive interventions that might be challenging to imple -
ment in routine practice (and within publicly funded 
social care systems), or on designs that informed parents 
what to do without providing support to change and sus -
tain behaviours overtime. Also, many bedtime routine 
interventions failed to engage in co-design with users or 
in-depth exploration of the target behaviours involved 
prior to intervention development and implementation.
With bedtime routines comprising a series of behav -
iours, it is pertinent to undertake a robust, evidence-
based approach to intervention development using 
established behaviour change frameworks like the 
Behavioural Change Wheel (BCW) [12]. Following the 
principles outlined in the BCW framework, it is possi -
ble to ensure that the target behaviour and the barriers 
and facilitators for that behaviour are clearly conceptu -
alised before moving on to intervention development 
and implementation. The same principles highlight the 
criteria likely to influence the feasibility and success of 
a behavioural intervention through the APEASE criteria 
(Affordability, Practicability, Effectiveness, Accessibility, 
Safety and Equity) and the need for feasibility and proof-
of-concept studies prior to larger, more robust and long-
term evaluations [13].
Given the intrinsic role that bedtime routines play 
in family life, it is also important to use co-design 
Page 3 of 12
 Kitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:79 
 
approaches to ensure the developed intervention will 
work for the intended population in real life. Design 
principles, like design thinking, advocate for an agile, 
user-inclusive and collaborative approach for the devel -
opment of interventions providing a basis for building 
more effective and successful interventions [14]. Finally, 
with regards to delivering interventions, cost-effective, 
user-friendly approaches should be considered first. One 
cost-effective, easy to use and empirically supported 
approach is to use text messages [15]. Text messages have 
been used extensively within health behaviour change 
interventions; however, thus far, such interventions have 
never been used to deliver a standalone intervention for 
bedtime. Also, text messages avoid the need for internet 
connectivity and smartphone technology resulting in 
more equitable access with ownership of working mobile 
phones at an all-time high across the UK.
Objectives
The present feasibility, proof-of-concept study aims to 
test a theory-informed text message-based intervention 
for achieving optimal bedtime routines for first-time par -
ents with young children. Specifically, the study (a) exam -
ines recruitment and retention rates during the study 
with an aim to recruit 50 participants within a specified 
recruitment period and retain at least 90% of them by 
the end of the study, (b) explores preliminary changes in 
three key outcomes (children’s quality and duration of 
sleep, bedtime routine quality and parental mood) pre- 
and post-intervention and (c) gathers participant feed -
back on intervention acceptability and suggestions for 
moving forward with additional research projects guided 
by user-involvement and input.
Methods
Overview
A detailed protocol for this study has been published 
previously [10]. This study forms part of a wider Bedtime Routines Intervention for Children (BRIC) project 
involving specific work packages over an 18-month 
period. Despite lack of randomisation, the CONSORT 
statement extension to pilot and feasibility studies [16] 
has been used to present the results of this study omitting 
non-applicable items from the checklist [17]. Additional 
file A presents the completed CONSORT checklist.
Intervention
An iterative approach was used throughout the wider 
BRIC project, guided by behavioural principles for 
designing, developing and implementing interventions. 
Two main work packages were included in the wider, 
BRIC project. Work package 1 focused mainly on getting 
a better understanding of common barriers and facili -
tators establishing and implementing optimal bedtime 
routines [3]. Table  1 summarises the key barriers identi -
fied during this process. Once key barriers and facilita -
tors had been identified, appropriate behaviour change 
techniques (BCTs) were selected and translated into a 
text message-based intervention for first-time parents. 
Table  1 presents an overview of how appropriate BCTs 
were selected to address the key barriers. Barriers were 
mapped into the theoretical domains framework (TDF) 
domains (a framework which summarises 84 possible 
determinants of behaviour into overarching theoretical 
domains allowing for a comprehensive exploration of all 
possible determinants of bedtime routines) [12] which 
were then mapped into the relevant COM-B (Capabil -
ity, Opportunity, Motivation–Behaviour) components 
resulting in the identification of appropriate intervention 
functions and BCTs.
For the identified intervention functions, the following 
behaviour change techniques are applicable to change 
and sustain changes to the target behaviour.
• Education: (a) information about consequences 
(proximal/distal), (b) prompts and (c) cues

behaviour
• Enablement: (a) goal setting, (b) review behaviour/
goals
Once appropriate BCTs were selected, they were used 
to develop the content of the intervention text messages. 
A small group of first-time parents (N = 7), who were 
recruited during work package 1, provided feedback on 
different versions of the intervention text messages. In 
total, 2 development cycles were initiated with parents 
testing each design and providing feedback that was then 
used to make necessary changes. Feedback was provided 
through online sessions with the parents. Engaging par -
ents in the design process was important to ensure that 
the content struck the right tone for parents with young 
children, the content was easy to comprehend and fol -
low, the length of each text message was appropriate and 
finally, sources used in the text messages were perceived 
as reliable from parents. The final intervention was a 
series of text messages that would be sent to parents 
each night for 7 consecutive nights and timed to arrive 
approximately 1 h before their child’s normal bedtime. 
Each text message was unique and included content 
designed around a relevant BCT with the aim of increas -
ing engagement in optimal bedtime routine behaviours.
Through this process and the feedback provided by par -
ents, the decision was made to provide participants on 
the feasibility, proof-of-concept study with two alterna -
tive versions of the intervention to choose between each 
night: a detailed version and a shorter, summary version. 
Regardless of the version chosen, participants received 
text messages for 7 consecutive nights. The detailed ver -
sion included lengthier, more detailed information, prac -
tical support and messages aimed at motivating parents 
in order to achieve an optimal bedtime routine. In the 
detailed version, a total of 10 text messages were sent 
to participants each night. The detailed version lasted a 
total of 5 min each night. The summary version covered 
the same content but more succinctly and acted more as 
a brief reminder of the key behaviours to be performed 
each night. In the summary version, a total of 6 text mes -
sages were sent to participants each night. The summary 
version lasted a total of 3 min each night.
At the start of the intervention week, parents were 
asked (by text message) if they were ready to receive the 
intervention. At that stage and before receiving the inter -
vention, parents were offered the option to delay the text 
messages, defer them to the next day or drop out of the 
study all together. Text messages were personalized with 
the participant’s first name and participants decided the time they wished to receive the text messages. Text 
messages included a series of links to external, evidence-
based and credible resources and information from the 
National Health Service (NHS) and Public Health Eng -
land (PHE) in the UK.
Feasibility, proof- of-concept study
In order to test the feasibility of the developed inter -
vention, n = 50 first time parents with one child aged 
1–3 years were recruited into a 7-day study where they 
received the intervention by text message on a nightly 
basis.
Recruitment
Due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, all recruitment 
was undertaken online. The research team joined a series 
of parent groups on social media where posts informing 
potential participants about the study were shared with 
prior permission from group moderators/administrators. 
Also, a series of nurseries and kindergartens across Eng -
land were invited to share information about the study 
with parents. Exclusion criteria included (a) inability to 
speak English, (b) not having a working mobile phone, 
(c) having more than 1 child and (d) having children 
under the age of 1 or over the age of 3. Parents had to 
make first contact with the research team in response to 
a study advertisement, and on doing so were provided 
with a more detailed participant information sheet and 
an online consent form. Parents were offered up to 48 
h to decide if they wanted to participate in the study. 
Those who agreed to take part in the study were assigned 
unique participant IDs. Recruitment took place between 
September 2020 and January 2021.
Procedure
Each participant completed a brief demographics form 
with questions on age, gender, child’s age and gender, 
ethnicity, employment and level of education. Also, 
each participant completed a contact form where they 
provided their mobile phone number and indicated the 
time and day on which they wish to start receiving the 
intervention. Before receiving the intervention, each 
participant completed three online questionnaires to 
assess the three main outcomes of children’s sleep qual -
ity and duration (Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire), 
parental mood (Profile of Mood States) and bedtime 
routine quality (Bedtime Routines Questionnaire). 
The text message intervention lasted for 7 consecutive 
nights and text messages arrived at the time indicated 
by participants in the contact forms (and in general, 1 
h before the child was due to be in bed). Each night, 
participants had the option to delay, defer or fully opt-
out from the study. At the end of the 7 days, the three

 Kitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:79 
 
questionnaires were completed again online. Feedback 
was requested from each participant at the end of the 
study and was provided by both anonymized text sur -
veys and online-hosted focus groups. Once a partici -
pant completed all steps of the study, they received a 
£10 voucher (to be used online) that was sent via post 
to their home address.
Measures
The Children’s Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) [18] 
contains 22 questions answered on a 5-point Likert 
scale (always, usually, sometimes, rarely and never) and 
produces 4 subscales relating to children’s sleeping hab -
its: bedtime routine activities, sleep-related behaviours, 
night waking and morning wake up behaviours. Higher 
scores indicate better quality sleep. The CSHQ has been 
used extensively within sleep research with high outcome 
validity and reliability.
The original version of the Bedtime Routines Ques -
tionnaire (BRQ) [19] contains 31 questions on a 5-point 
Likert scale (almost never, occasionally, half the time, 
often and nearly always) spread across four target areas: 
weekdays, weekends, how upset the child gets if he or she 
does not perform some activities and a list of 15 bedtime-
related activities). For the purpose of this study, an adap -
tive version of the BRQ was used where the 15 bedtime 
related activities were condensed to 8 overarching activi -
ties that better reflected the activities targeted by the 
intervention, for example, in the original BRQ the sepa -
rate activities of ‘hug/kiss caregiver’ , ‘say goodnight to 
family members’ , ‘get tucked in’ , ‘put on pajamas’ , ‘cuddle’ 
and ‘say prayers’ were grouped together as ‘interactive, 
positive activities between parent/child’ with specific 
examples offered to participants to further explain the 
term. Higher scores indicate more optimal bedtime rou -
tines. The validity and reliability of the BRQ has been 
indicated in work by Henderson and Jordan [19].
Finally, as a longstanding, validated, reliable and easy to 
complete measurement, the Abbreviated version of the 
Profile of Mood States (POMS) [20] has been selected in 
order to assess parental mood disturbance. POMS con -
tains 40 statements that participants need to score using 
a 5-point Likert scale (not at all, a little, moderately, quite 
a lot and extremely). Seven subscales are calculated from 
scores: parental tension, anger, fatigue, depression, self-
esteem, vigor and confusion. Total negative scores (ten -
sion, anger, fatigue, confusion and depression) are added 
together and then the positive scores are subtracted sub -
tracting the total positive scores (self-esteem and vigor) 
to produce the total mood disturbance score where 
higher scores indicate higher parental mood disturbance 
(i.e. greater negative mood).Feedback
At the end of the intervention, parents were sent an 
anonymized feedback text survey where they were asked 
a series of open and close-ended questions regarding 
their participation in the study, the quality, frequency and 
content of the text messages as well as space for offering 
recommendations on what needs to change. Parents were 
also invited to an optional focus group held online to fur -
ther discuss their participation in the study and provide 
more comments, feedback and suggestions on how to 
improve the intervention moving forward.
Analyses
Descriptive data analyses were used for demographic 
information as well as for the feedback provided by par -
ticipants through text surveys. Differences in pre- and 
post-intervention scores were compared using paired 
samples t-tests for each of the three outcomes used in the 
study. Exploratory sub-scale analyses with pre and post 
scores and t-test results were also conducted with cor -
rections (Bonferroni correction) for multiple analyses. 
For feedback provided by participants, thematic analy -
ses were performed on the focus group data at the end 
of the study to identify common themes arising during 
the discussions. Descriptive data and frequency counts 
were analysed for feedback provided via anonymized text 
surveys. Cost was calculated based on the cost of a single 
text message send to a UK-registered number.
Results
Sample characteristics
In total, 50 first-time parents were recruited for the 
study. Table  2 provides an overview of sample charac -
teristics including age and gender of parents taking part 
in the study, their educational and employment status 
and details on ethnicity. Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(IMD), a national instrument for calculating and quanti -
fying deprivation across England, deciles were calculated 
based on participants’ postcodes. Low deciles indicate 
higher deprivation.
Recruitment and retention rates
During the recruitment period, 75 potential participants 
approached the research team with 50 deciding to partic -
ipate in the study and complete necessary forms includ -
ing a consent form resulting in a 67% recruitment rate. 
During the study, there was only one participant who 
dropped out after completing the pre-study question -
naires. All remaining participants (N = 49) completed all 
measurements resulting in a high retention rate of 98%.

Type of intervention
Each night, participants were presented with two ver -
sions of the intervention (detailed and summary). The 
first night, all participants opted in for the detailed ver -
sion. For the second night, most participants (30/50) 
opted for the summary version. Thereafter, for nights 3 
to 7, most participants (40/50) opted for the summary 
version. Only a small number of participants (3/50) inter -
changed between the different versions, with no specific 
pattern, beyond the third night. In the analyses presented 
below, there were no changes depending on the type of 
intervention used by participants in the study.
Effects on children’s sleep, quality of bedtime routines 
and parental mood disturbance
Paired sample t tests were performed to explore changes 
in pre- and post-intervention scores on the three meas -
urements used in the study: children’s sleep, bedtime 
routines and parental mood disturbance. For total scores across all three questionnaires, there were positive 
changes pre- and post-intervention: children’s sleep qual -
ity improved pre-post-intervention (MD = − 7.77 (SD 
= 17.91), t(48) = − 3.03, p = .004, CI (− 12.91, − 2.63)). 
Also, overall bedtime routine quality improved pre-
post (MD = − 5.00, SD = 7.01, t(48) = − 4.98, p < .001, 
CI (− 7.01, − 2.98)). Finally, total parental mood distur -
bance decreased from pre-post-intervention (MD = 5.87, 
SD = 15.43, t(48) = 2.66), p = .010, CI (1.44, 10.30)). 
Figure  1 presents a visualization of total score changes 
pre-post-intervention.
Changes were also observed on specific subscales 
within each of the three outcome measures used in this 
study. More specifically, for children’s sleep, there were 
improvements across three out of its four subscales: (a) 
bedtime routine behaviours were improved pre-post-
intervention (MD = − 3.51, SD = 9.47, t(48) = − 2.59, 
p = .013, CI (− 6.23, − 0.78), (b) night waking episodes 
improved pre-post-intervention (MD = − 1.67, SD = Table 2 Sample characteristics

3.74, t(48) = − 2.61, p = .050, CI = − 2.75, 0.79)) and 
(c) morning wake up behaviours were also improved 
pre-post-intervention (MD = − 1.81, SD = 3.50,t(48) = 
− 3.62, p = .001, CI (− 2.82, − 0.80)). For children’s sleep, 
the only subscale that failed to show changes pre-post-
intervention were the sleep-related behaviours (i.e. naps 
during the day, restlessness during sleep, grinding teeth 
and snoring while asleep) (MD = − 1.46, SD = 5.48, t(48) 
= − 1.87, p = .067, CI (− 3.04, 0.10)).
Six out of the seven subscales in the parental mood 
disturbance measure also showed improvements pre- 
and post-intervention. On reported negative emotions, 
parents reported feeling less tense pre-post-intervention 
(MD = 1.14, SD = 3.54,, t(48) = 2.25, p = .028, CI (.12, 
2.06), less angry pre-post-intervention (MD = 0.75, SD 
= 2.28, t(48) = 2.31, p = .025, CI (0.10, 1.41) and less 
fatigued post-intervention (MD = 1.24, SD = 4.53, t(48) 
= 2.10, p = .050, CI (− .05, 2.54); and less confused post-
intervention (MD = 0.57, SD = 1.99, t(48) = 2.01, p = 
.050, CI (− 0.04, 1,14)). With regards to positive emo -
tions, parents reported both higher self-esteem post-
intervention (MD = − 1.10, SD = 2.83, t(48) = − 2.72, p 
= .009, CI (− 1.91, − 0.28)) and higher vigor post-inter -
vention (MD = − 0.81, SD = 2.86, t(48) = − 2.00, p = .05, 
CI = − 1.64, 0.08).
Finally, for the bedtime routines questionnaire, all 
three of its subscales indicated improvements pre- and 
post-intervention. Bedtime routines improved both at 
weekdays pre-post-intervention (MD = − 0.87, SD = 1.95, t(48) = − 3.21, p = .002, CI (− 7.01, − 2.98)) and 
at weekends pre-post intervention (MD = − 1.32, SD = 
2.22, t(48) = − 4.16, p < .001, CI (− 1.96, − 0.68)). Finally, 
bedtime routine-related activities were improved pre- 
(MD = − 2.97, SD = 4.79, t(48) = − 4.52, p < .001, CI 
(− 4.17, − 1.41)). Bedtime routine activities covered a 
total of eight targeted areas. Within those eight areas, six 
produced important results pre- and post-intervention. 
Parents read more to their children pre-post-intervention 
(MD = − 0.71, SD = 1.24, t(48) = − 4.027, p < .000, CI 
(− 1.00, − 0.35)); parents also interacted more with their 
children pre-post intervention (MD = − 0.63, SD = 1.09, 
t(48) = − 4.05, p < .000, CI (− 0.94, − 0.31)); children 
watched less TV the hour before bed pre-post-inter -
vention (MD = 1.00, SD = 1.44, t(48) = 4.85, p < .001, 
CI (0.58, 1.41)); children also played less with electronic 
devices the hour before bed pre-post-intervention (MD 
= 0.36, SD = 0.88, t(48) = 2.91, p = .005, CI (0.11, 0.62)); 
children were also allowed fewer snacks and drinks other 
than water and unflavoured milk the hour before bed pre-
post-intervention (MD = 0.57, SD = 1.33, t(48) = 2.98, 
p = .004, CI (0.18, 0.95)) and finally, children brushed 
their teeth more pre-post-intervention (MD = 0.61, SD 
= 1.77, t(48) = − 2.41, p = .020, CI (− 1.12, − 0.10)). The 
only two bedtime routine activities that failed to show 
changes pre-post-intervention were children’s play t(48) 
= − .43, p = 668 and having a shower or a bath before 
bed t(48) = − .86, p = .392, but neither of these behav -
iours were explicitly targeted in the current intervention. Fig. 1 Changes in total scores for sleep, bedtime routines and parental mood disturbance pre-post-intervention with confidence intervals. **result

Feedback and cost
Feedback was provided through anonymous text mes -
sage surveys at the end of the project and through 
online focus groups. A total of 47/50 participants pro -
vided anonymized feedback via text surveys while 25 
participants joined an online focus group. Participants overall reported a very positive experience awarding an 
average satisfaction score of 9 out of 10 for the inter -
vention. Participants also commented positively on 
the use of and interaction with the text messages they 
received, scoring a 9.5 out of 10 for ease of use. Par -
ticipants reported high acceptability of the interven -
tion with an average score of 9 out of 10 as well as high 
practicability with an average score of 8.5 out of 10. 
There were no reported safety issues from participants

and only 1 out of 47 participants mentioned cost as a 
factor that might needs to be considered in the future. 
Also, 43 participants (88% of all participants) said 
they will recommend this intervention to family and 
friends if it was more widely available. Finally, partici -
pants expressed no outright preference with regards 
to the two versions of the intervention with both ver -
sions (detailed and summary) receiving equally positive 
reviews and feedback.
The focus group discussed participants’ experiences 
more broadly while also exploring what should change 
in the intervention and what should remain moving for -
ward. In terms of areas that might need to be changed in 
the future, participants wanted to see (a) a more dynamic 
and personalized intervention that allowed participants 
to choose the level of support, the frequency of text mes -
sages and the content of text messages, (b) some partici -
pants expressed a desire for a richer interface through 
the use of multimedia content along the lines of a mobile 
application or electronic resources alongside the text 
messages and finally and (c) parents would have liked to 
see both earlier and later ages included in the interven -
tion (before the age of 1 and past the age of 3). In terms 
of things parents wanted to keep in any future iterations 
of the intervention, they strongly advocated for (a) main -
taining the friendly, fact-based and concise nature of 
advice offered to them and (b) the easiness of the inter -
vention in terms of interacting with it every night.
Each participant received on average 7 text messages 
per night resulting in a total of 49 text messages during 
the 7 nights of the study. Each text message costs on aver -
age £0.04 to send and £0.007 to receive. Therefore, for 
each participant, there was a cost of £0.04 × 49 = £1.96 
for sending text messages over the 7-night period. Also, 
each participant was therefore charged a total of £0.007 
× 49 = £0.34 for receiving the text messages over the 
7-night period. That figure (£0.34) does not account for 
unlimited text messaging that is usually offered to indi -
viduals with a monthly mobile phone contract in the UK.
Discussion
This feasibility, proof-of-concept study implemented and 
tested a theory and user informed, text message-based 
intervention for achieving optimal bedtime routines for 
first-time parents. Sufficient numbers of parents were 
recruited into the study and the retention rate was high. 
Preliminary data indicate beneficial effects across three 
key outcomes: children’s sleep quality, bedtime routine 
quality and parental mood disturbance pre- and post-
intervention. At the end of the study, participants pro -
vided positive feedback and expressed their support and 
desire to see such an intervention more widely available.Recruitment and retention
The first objective of this feasibility, proof-of-concept 
study was to explore if we can successfully recruit N 
= 50 participants during a pre-specified recruitment 
period and retain at least 90% of participants till the 
end of the study including the completion of all study 
measurements. Despite adaptations to our previously 
published protocol [10] due to the COVID-19 pan -
demic which rendered our original recruitment plan 
obsolete, we were able to recruit our target sample 
within our pre-specified period. All recruitment took 
place online with electronic consent forms. An ethics 
amendment was essential however, no delays on the 
completion of the project occurred. Retention rate of 
98% (N  = 49) was achieved surpassing our initial target 
of 90%.
Effects on children’s sleep
Based on the results of the study, there were positive 
changes pre-post-intervention with regards to chil -
dren’s sleep quality as assessed by the Child Sleep Hab -
its Questionnaire. Changes were also suggested across 
three out of the four subscales within the question -
naire. A wide body of available research has indicated 
a strong link between the quality of bedtime routines 
and children’s sleep, so this finding is in line with exist -
ing research in the area [2 ]. Sleep is a salient feature of 
overall health with poor sleep hygiene affecting chil -
dren’s development, school performance, mood and 
cognitive functioning and development [21]. Also, chil -
dren’s sleep is associated with parental sleep with the 
former affecting the latter resulting in poor sleeping 
habits for parents when children’s sleep is poor [2 ].
Bedtime routines
Bedtime routine scores were improved pre-post-inter -
vention indicating the potential improvement in the 
quality of routines experienced by parents and chil -
dren as a result of the intervention. Bedtime routines 
improved not only on weekdays but also on weekends 
suggesting that the beneficial effects of the intervention 
were still apparent during periods where the evidence 
suggests that routines are often relaxed. Most bedtime 
routine activities (i.e. reading before bed, brushing 
teeth etc.) were improved pre- and post-intervention, 
with only two activities that were not improved (i.e. 
having a shower or a bath before bed and children’s play 
before bed). Both were behaviours not specifically tar -
geted by the intervention. The pattern of effects—i.e. 
changes in targeted behaviours but not in associated 
but non-targeted behaviours—suggest that the inter -
vention operated as intended.
Page 10 of 12 Kitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:79 
For the activities where changes were observed, 
brushing is an important one to highlight. A quarter of 
parents reported not consistently brushing their chil -
dren’s teeth at night before the intervention. Post-inter -
vention, there was an increase in the number of parents 
who reported brushing their children’s teeth always or 
nearly always at night. Despite advancements in pre -
venting dental disease, there are still pockets of poor 
dental health in the community and not brushing teeth 
at night, as well as sub optimal oral hygiene practises in 
the morning and throughout the day, can increase the 
likelihood of dental decay [22]. Dental decay, a mainly 
preventable disease, can have subsequent implications 
for children’s well-being and development with unnec -
essary dental pain when the disease progresses, missed 
hours and days at school with pain also affecting chil -
dren’s sleep [4 , 23, 24]. In some cases, children with 
advanced decay will need to undergo dental extractions 
under general anaesthetic resulting in additional nega -
tive consequences [25].
Parental mood disturbance
Parental mood disturbance was assessed by the profile 
of mood states with changes pre- and post-intervention. 
Parents felt less tense, less fatigued, less confused, less 
angry post intervention while also reporting higher vig -
our and self-esteem. Reflecting on the common barri -
ers to enacting an optimal bedtime routine that parents 
reported in a previous piece of work, fatigue as well as 
lack of motivation for change were two of the most com -
mon barriers identified [3]. Therefore, if the present 
intervention offers parents the tools, tips and information 
necessary to achieve optimal routines, the present results 
indicate that parents will feel less tired, less fatigued and 
more motivated to change their routines and may there -
fore be more able to sustain positive changes over time. 
Such effects are likely to be cyclical and self-reinforcing 
and may therefore contribute to the likelihood that posi -
tive changes will be sustained over time.
Reflecting on the APEASE criteria
Considering the APEASE criteria (Affordability, Practi -
cability, Effectiveness, Accessibility, Safety and Equity), 
the study results overall indicate that five criteria were 
satisfied. Affordability and equity were not mentioned as 
an issue from the majority of participants who provided 
feedback, and virtually all participants (from all socio -
economic backgrounds) were able to access and inter -
act with the intervention text messages through existing 
mobile plans. Cost was kept to a minimum with £0.34 
charged to participants’ mobile phones and only when 
they had pay-as-you-go contracts in place. Safety was not 
an issue in the current study as the intervention did not introduce any risk to participants. Participants reported 
the intervention, in its current format, to be both prac -
tical and acceptable with no problems fitting it around 
their bedtime schedules. Our high retention rate (98%) 
in part reflects the non-invasive and practical nature of 
the intervention in its current format. Finally, the pre -
liminary data collected on the effects of the intervention 
on three key metrics of children’s sleep, bedtime routines 
and parental mood disturbance show positive indications 
with regards to its effectiveness.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths
This study, and the BRIC project more widely, show -
cased a series of strengths. An evidence-based, stepped 
approach was taken from the beginning of the project to 
reflect established behavioural principles on designing, 
developing, implementing and evaluating interventions. 
That allowed for the exploration of barriers and facilita -
tors as well as for user-inclusivity across the design and 
development of the intervention. The intervention itself 
was tested within a feasibility and proof of concept study 
with a diverse socioeconomic and sociodemographic 
sample. Standardised measures were used to quantify 
changes in key outcomes pre- and post-intervention. 
Also, there was a wide use of feedback mechanisms 
throughout the study resulting in a wide range of oppor -
tunities for learning and reflecting on what worked and 
what needs to change in the future. Finally, this study first 
devised in 2019, had to quickly adapt to the rapid changes 
created by a global pandemic with all its operations and 
procedures shifted online. Despite the unprecedented 
changes brought by COVID-19, this study managed to 
complete all its tasks and objectives within time and with 
no shortcomings, indicating the likely practicality and 
ease of delivering a similar intervention in practice.
Limitations
The main limitations of this study are the lack of a con -
trol group and the use of a convenience sample. A ran -
domised control trial is required to examine pre- and 
post-intervention changes in outcomes; however, the 
present study was focused on determining whether the 
developed intervention using text messages for bedtime 
routines was feasible for use with first time parents. This 
stepped approach allowed the concept underpinning the 
intervention to be tested without the expense of a RCT 
design behind it. The convenience sampling approach 
may have limited the generalisability of findings, but 
the final sample was relatively diverse in terms of socio -
economic and demographic mix. Also, the requirement 
for participants to speak and understand English as this 
could have hindered the participation of families from 
Page 11 of 12
 Kitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:79 
 
marginalised groups. Moving forward, more language 
options for this type of intervention will be considered. 
The lack of total hours of sleep for children is another 
limitation as is the variation on the level of the interven -
tion parents and children received each night given the 
choice for a detailed or summary version. Monitoring of 
engagement with different versions of the intervention 
will need to be in place in future work to better under -
stand how it might affect results.
Future directions
With a successful feasibility, proof of concept study com -
plete, the immediate focus for the BRIC project will be 
a robust, larger scale randomised controlled trial with 
a longitudinal follow up to determine the effects (both 
short and long-term) of a text message-based interven -
tion for bedtime routines with first-time parents and 
their children. The focus of this longitudinal, controlled 
study should be on a series of important outcomes linked 
to bedtime routines including children’s oral health, 
school readiness, socio-emotional development, cog -
nitive functioning and sleep as well as on parents’ soci -
oemotional wellbeing and family functioning more 
broadly. In addition, some changes may be made to the 
intervention itself on the basis of the detailed and con -
structive feedback provided by participants in the cur -
rent study. Finally, alongside a robust controlled study, 
considerations should be made on how to best integrate 
any such intervention with routine practice for real world 
delivery to first-time parents.
Conclusion
Bedtime routines encompass many behaviours, and opti -
mal routines have clear health, development and wellbe -
ing benefits for children and parents alike. Achieving and 
sustaining optimal bedtime routines has the potential to 
positively impact on a wide range of future outcomes for 
children while simultaneously offering parents some vital 
support and immediate benefits on a day-to-day basis. 
Cost-effective (a few pence per day), user-friendly inter -
ventions, like the present text message intervention for 
bedtime routines are feasible and have the potential to 
help parents achieve optimal routines. Additional work is 
necessary to conclusively establish the long-terms effects 
of such an intervention.
