7 
8 Abstract  
10 
11 The benefits of exclusive breastfeeding are well documented, yet few women adhere  to 
13 
14 recommendations. This systematic review reports the Behaviour Change Te chniques  (BCTs)  
15 
16 within interventions trialled internationally after pregnancy to promote exclusive and  mixed  
17 
18 breastfeeding as well as evidence of effectiveness. PsycINFO, EMBASE and  MEDLINE  
20 
21 databases were screened. Twenty -three ( n = 23) studies met inclusion criteria. Three  authors  
22 
23 independently extracted data, coded interventions using the BCT v.1 taxonomy, and  assessed  
24 
25 study quality. There was a moderate significant effect of the interventions promoting  exclusive  
26 
27 
28 breastfeeding up to four weeks postpartum (OR 1.77, [95% CI: 1.47 -2.13]) but this effect  slightly  
29 
30 declined beyond thirteen weeks (OR 1.63, [95% CI: 1.07 -2.47). Twenty -nine BCTs  were  
31 
32 identified within interventions. ‘Credible source’ and ‘instruct ion on how to perform  the 
33 
34 behaviour’ were the most prevalent and ‘social support (unspecified)’ contributed to  the 
36 
37 effectiveness of exclusive breastfeeding interventions five to eight weeks postpartum. The use  of 
38 
39 BCTs covering cognitive and behavioural aspects may help women develop coping  mechanisms  
40 
41 promoting exclusive breastfeeding. Further trials evaluating interventions are needed in  countries  
43 
44 with low breastfeeding rates such as the U.K. The use of program theory during  intervention  
45 
46 development and clear description of intervention components is recommended. This  meta - 
47 
48 analysis provides guidance for trials evaluating postpartum breastfeeding interventions  and 
49 
50 
51 information on components for developing  interventions.

3 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding fo r the first 
4 
5 six months following birth, with continued breastfeeding in addition to complementary foods  for 
7 
8 up to two years or more (World Health Organization, 2011). To promote this guideline,  UNICEF  
9 
10 has partnered with WHO for the ‘Baby Frie ndly Initiative’ (UNICEF, 2011) which aims  to 
11 
12 empower healthcare staff to initiate conversations with parents about implementing  breastfeeding  
14 
15 best practice standards. In the U.K., the Department of Health recommends the ‘Baby  Friendly  
16 
17 Initiative’ as the minimum standard (The National Institute for Health and Care  Excellence,  
18 
19 2014). Women postpartum receive support from maternity care providers either in hospital  or 
20 
21 
22 primary care who support and encourage breastfeeding in ge neral and exclusive breastfeeding  for 
23 
24 at least 6 months. In the U.S.A., the American Academy of Paediatrics also  recommends  
25 
26 exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with additional breastfeeding and complementary  foods  
27 
28 for at least one ye ar (Eidelman et al., 2012). Despite these recommendations and  support  
30 
31 mechanisms, exclusive breastfeeding continues to be a challenge for many  women.  
32 
33 
34 Health Benefits of  Breastfeeding  
35 
36 Breastfeeding is associated with a multitude of hea lth benefits for both infants  and 
38 
39 mothers (Dyson et al., 2006; Eidelman et al., 2012; Ip, Chung, Raman, Trikalinos, & Lau,  2009).  
40 
41 For the infant, breastfeeding has been associated with reduced risk of respiratory  and 
42 
43 gastrointestinal trac t infections (Chantry, Howard, & Auinger, 2006; Duijts, Jaddoe, Hofman,  & 
44 
45 
46 Moll, 2010; Duijts, Ramadhani, & Moll, 2009), allergies (Greer, Sicherer, & Burks, 2008),  and 
47 
48 sudden infant death syndrome (Hauck, Thompson, Tanabe, Moon, & Vennemann,  2011;  
49 
50 Thompson et al., 2017). In many cases there is a dose -response relationship, with  greater  
51 
52 duration of breastfeeding conferring greater health benefits for the infant (Eidelman et al.,  2012).  
54 
55 Some evidence also suggests that breast feeding protects against being overweight as well  as

3 obesity, and developing type 2 diabetes in childhood and later in life (Horta, Loret de Mola,  & 
4 
5 Victora, 2015; Jwa, Fujiwara, & Kondo, 2014 ; Owen, Martin, Whincup, Smith, & Cook,  2005;  
7 
8 Yan, Liu, Zhu, Huang, & Wang,  2014).  
9 
10 
11 Among mothers, breastfeeding is associated with lower risk of hypertension  (Nguyen,  
12 
13 Jin, & Ding, 2017), cardiovascular disease (Schwarz et al., 2009), and type 2 diabetes  (Aune,  
14 
15 Norat, Romundstad, & Vatten, 2014; Schwarz et al., 2010). A recent systematic review  indicates  
16 
17 that breastfeeding for more than twelve months is associated with reduced risk of breast  cancer  
19 
20 and ovarian cancer (Cho wdhury et al., 2015). Furthermore, for every one month of  breastfeeding  
21 
22 the lower the odds of ovarian cancer (Feng, Chen, & Shen, 2014; Luan et al.,  2013).  
23 
24 Breastfeeding  Rates  
26 
27 Breastfeeding for twelve months or more in high -income countr ies is lower than  20%,  
28 
29 with the U.K. having the lowest rates at less than one percent (Victora et al., 2016). Previous  data 
31 
32 from 2010 indicate that the rate of initial breastfeeding in the U.K. on average was  81%.  
33 
34 However, a survey in 20 12 showed that the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at birth was  even  
35 
36 lower at 69% (McAndrew et al., 2012). Rates of breastfeeding in the U.K. at six to eight  weeks  
38 
39 postpartum drops to 43.7% (Public Health England, 2018), and by six months only  34% of 
40 
41 mothers report breastfeeding and only 1% report exclusive breastfeeding. Based on U.S.A.  2016  
42 
43 data, 81% of American mothers who gave birth to infants in 2013 reported ever  breastfeeding  
44 
45 
46 (Center for Disease Prevention and Contro l, 2016). About half (52%) reported any  breastfeeding  
47 
48 and 22% reported exclusive breastfeeding at six months. Thus, very few mothers adhere to  the 
49 
50 WHO and national  recommendations.  
51 
52 
53 Overall, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in high-income countries (<20%)  is 
54 
55 lower than developing countries in sub -Saharan Africa, south Asia and Latin America  (<37%)

3 (Victora et al., 2016). Despite evidence indicating numerous benefit s of breastfeeding  on 
4 
5 maternal and infant health, and although most infants in developed countries like the U.S.A.  and 
7 
8 U.K. receive at least some breastfeeding, the majority of mothers in these countries do not  adhere  
9 
10 to the recommendation of  exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with important  cultural  
11 
12 variation in  rates.  
14 
15 Barriers to and Facilitators of  Breastfeeding  
16 
17 
18 Evidence points to a range of physical, psychological and social barriers to  breastfeeding  
19 
20 includ ing birth complications and pain, social stigma, the responsibility being solely on  the 
21 
22 
23 mother, and difficulty estimating the quantity of milk the baby is receiving (Dennis, 2002;  Hill, 
24 
25 2000; Khoury, Moazzem, Jarjoura, Carothers, & Hinton, 2 005). Partner disapproval  of 
26 
27 breastfeeding has also been identified as a key barrier (Dennis, 2002; Scott & Binns, 1999),  as 
28 
29 well as uncertainty about what to expect with breastfeeding (Moore & Coty,  2006).  
31 
32 On the other hand, greater soc ial support, more positive attitudes towards  breastfeeding,  
33 
34 
35 and higher levels of breastfeeding self -efficacy are positively associated with  breastfeeding  
36 
37 duration (Moore & Coty, 2006; O’Campo, Faden, Gielen, & Wang, 1992). For example,  partn er 
38 
39 or mother support has been shown to facilitate breastfeeding (Dennis, 2002; Hill,  2000).  
40 
41 Evidence also suggests that mothers with higher levels of educational attainment are more  likely  
43 
44 to breastfeed in both the U.S.A. (Doyle & Kelleh er, 2010; Tarrant, 2003) and U.K. (McMillan  et 
45 
46 al., 2009).  
47 
48 
49 Support from healthcare professionals that includes encouragement combined  with 
50 
51 practical training and demonstration are effective approaches promoting breastfeeding  (Hannula,  
52 
53 Kaunonen, & Tarkka, 2008). The role of midwives is particularly important especially for  multi - 
55 
56 ethnic communities (Loiselle, Semenic, Côté, Lapointe, & Gendron, 2016). On the other  hand,

3 professionals also need education and organisational support to promote breastfeeding so  that 
4 
5 peer support and education is combined with professional support to promote  breastfeeding  
7 
8 benefits (Bibbins -Domingo et al.,  2016).  
9 
10 
11 Parental lack  of knowledge can also prevent new mothers from breastfeeding.  Parents  
12 
13 who have breastfed their children are more knowledgeable about the health benefits  of 
14 
15 breastfeeding compared to parents who fed their children formula (Shaker, Scott, & Reid , 2004).  
16 
17 Evidence suggests that a woman’s decision to breastfeed can be influenced by her  mother’s  
19 
20 choice of feeding method. Indeed, those who were breastfed themselves are likely to hold  more  
21 
22 positive attitudes and intentions to breastf eed compared to individuals who were not  (Earle,  
23 
24 2000). Therefore, it is not surprising that improving parents’ knowledge about the benefits  of 
26 
27 breastfeeding has been found to significantly increase the likelihood of breastfeeding (Susin  et 
28 
29 al., 1999).  
30 
31 
32 Several studies have also explored the types of beliefs that can serve as facilitators  of 
33 
34 breastfeeding. These include beliefs that breastfeeding is more natural than bottle  feeding,  
35 
36 promotes improved infant health, fa cilitates maternal -infant bonding, is low cost, has  benefits  
38 
39 both for the mother and the baby, and is convenient and enjoyable (Dennis, 2002; Khoury et  al., 
40 
41 2005; Moore & Coty,  2006).  
42 
43 
44 Behaviour Change and Techniques in Breastfeeding  Interventions  
45 
46 
47 Interventions that are developed using a recognised theoretical underpinning, such as  the 
48 
49 Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie, van Stralen, & West, 2011) are generally shown to be  more  
50 
51 effective than non -theory -based interventio ns, as they are more likely to target  measurable  
52 
53 determinants of behaviour (Craig et al., 2008). In general, theory -driven interventions have  been  
55 
56 shown to have greater effectiveness for increasing women’s decision to breastfeed, and are  more

3 clearly defined and easier to evaluate relative to interventions not derived from theory  (Dodgson,  
4 
5 Henly, Duckett, & Tarrant, 2003; Giles et al.,  2014).  
7 
8 Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) ref er to those  components of an intervention  that 
9 
10 
11 are designed to change behaviour. They form the smallest and most active parts of  any 
12 
13 intervention and may be used alone or in combination with other BCTs (Michie et al.,  2011;  
14 
15 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2014).  The technique must also meet  specified  
16 
17 criteria so that it can be identified, observed, delivered, and reliably  replicated.  
19 
20 Certain BCTs may be more appropriate and effective for promoting speci fic health  
21 
22 
23 behaviours. For example, self -monitoring is one of the most effective BCTs for physical  activity  
24 
25 behaviour (French, Olander, Chisholm, & Mc Sharry, 2014), but may be less useful  for 
26 
27 breastfeeding. Self -efficacy as a determin ant of breastfeeding attitudes and intentions may be  a 
28 
29 less effective technique for women who have never breastfed than for women who  have  
31 
32 breastfed previously (Giles et al., 2014). To date there is no evidence to describe the BCTs  that 
33 
34 have been delivered within postpartum breastfeeding interventions for women to  inform  
35 
36 research, policy -making, and provide meaningful theoretical comparisons with BCTs used  in 
38 
39 other health behaviour interventions. Thus, a comprehensive review identifying BCTs used  in 
40 
41 promoting breastfeeding would make a substantial contribution to existing literature and  inform  
42 
43 future intervention  development.

46 Aims of the Present  Study

49 The aims of this systematic review are to (a) describe the published evidence  of 
50 
51 interventions aiming to promote mixed and exclusive breastfeeding among postpartum women  in 
52 
53 terms of their characteristics (e.g. country, use of theory etc.), (b) identify and report the  BCTs  
55 
56 used in th ese interventions, and (c) investigate the effectiveness of interventions aiming  to

3 promote exclusive breastfeeding among postpartum women at different time  intervals  
4 
5 postpartum.  
7 
8 There is a w eak association between breastfeeding intentions that constitute that target  of 
9 
10 
11 interventions during pregnancy and breastfeeding outcomes postpartum (Wambach, 1997).  This 
12 
13 calls for efforts to examine breastfeeding interventions after delivery  (Ahluwalia, Morrow  and 
14 
15 Hsia, 2005). Previous efforts to summarise the effectiveness of breastfeeding  interventions  
16 
17 include both those initiated during pregnancy and postpartum (Fairbank et al., 2000). This is  the 
19 
20 first review focusing o n interventions initiated postpartum and using an established  framework  
21 
22 (BCT) to establish intervention components and inform future intervention design and  delivery.  
23 
24 Moreover, reviewing the effectiveness of breastfeeding interventions at diff erent time  intervals  
26 
27 will provide useful information on the sustainability of available interventions as  previous  
28 
29 evidence suggest that the time period the intervention is initiated can be potentially  important  
30 
31 (Hannula, Kaunonen and Tark ka, 2008).

16 
17 
18 The inclusion criteria  were:  
19 
20 
21  Population: Women in the postpartum  period.  
22 
23  Interventions: Any type of intervention that aims to promote breastfeeding  either  
24 
25 exclusively or in combination with other forms of feeding the infant. Interventions  should  
27 
28 be initiated aft er giving birth because we are interested in mechanisms of  interventions  
29 
30 helping women to actually perform and not only consider  breastfeeding.  
31 
32  Comparisons: All types of comparison groups were  included.  
34 
35  Outcomes: The primary outcome was ‘exclusive breastfeeding’ rates as  previously  
36 
37 defined (World Health Organization, 2011). Exclusive breastfeeding was defined  as 
38 
39 feeding the infant with breast milk only. The secondary outcome was  ‘mixed  
41 
42 breastfeeding’ defined as feed ing the infant with breast milk in combination with  bottle - 
43 
44 feeding. The rates were calculated as the number of women in the intervention  and 
45 
46 control groups that were per exclusively and mixed breastfeeding at different time  points  
48 
49 postp artum.  
50 
51  Study design: Studies should have at least one intervention and one control group  with 
52 
53 pre-post intervention data. Both randomized and non -randomized trials were  eligible.

19 Two authors screened all titles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The  abstracts  
20 
21 and full -text were screened by three authors. Each reviewer checked 10% of the other  reviewers’

23 screening to ensure consistency. There was substantial agreement (McHugh 2012)  between  
24 
25

33 Three authors used a proforma to extract data from the included studies to  spreadsheets.  
35 
36 For each study, the study information, participant characteristics, and information about  the 
37 
38 intervention  and main outcomes were extracted. The extracted study information included  the 
39 
40 study authors, title, location, study period, and research design. The extracted  participant  
42 
43 characteristics included the eligibility criteria, sample size, age, p ostpartum week at  recruitment  
44 
45 and at intervention, differences at baseline, and attrition. The extracted information about  the 
46 
47 intervention included intensity, duration, theoretical background, the person delivering  the 
48 
49 
50 intervention an d any associated training, follow -up time from recruitment, control  procedures,  
51 
52 and use of blinding. The extracted information on main outcomes included effectiveness data  per 
53 
54 interval (outcomes were examined separately according to the week th ey were  assessed

11 Following screening, the authors aime d to identify BCTs used in included studies  as 
12 
13 defined in the BCT v.1 taxonomy (Abraham & Michie, 2008; Michie et al., 2013). Three  authors  
15 
16 who had undertaken online training in the BCT taxonomy v1 (Michie et al., 2015) reviewed  all 
17 
18 included studies to identify and code the BCTs according to the original 93 hierarchical  clustered  
19 
20 BCTs (Michie et al., 2013). To distinguish BCTs identified in each intervention, each coder  was 
21 
22 
23 requested to provide a confidence rating for each BCT. As a result, each BCT could be scored  as 
24 
25 ‘++’ when present beyond all reasonable doubt and with clear evidence available, and ‘+’  when  
26 
27 possibly present and with limited evidence available. Only BCTs in interventions that  were  
28 
29 direct ly relevant to breastfeeding as an outcome were coded. Where the publications  provided  
31 
32 information on the control group procedures, the same process was applied to identify any  BCTs  
33 
34 that were used in both the intervention and control groups. Th is information was used  for 
35 
36 sensitivity analyses. Each author coded 10% of the other authors’ codes and any  discrepancies  
38 
39 were discussed in a consensus meeting. There was a moderate inter -rater reliability  (McHugh,  
40 
41 2012) between coders ( IRR = 0.66) and discrepancies were resolved in a consensus  meeting.

48 
49 conducted to estimate effectiveness of interventions at the  four intervals (birth -four weeks,  five– 
50 
51 eight weeks, nine –12 weeks, and ≥ 13 weeks). Sample size, number of cases, and non -cases  of 
52 
53 exclusive breastfeeding were extracted in both the intervention and the control groups. From  the

3 in intervention and control group) the Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals  were  
4 
5 calculated. The first follow -up from one study (Kang, Choi, & Ryu, 2008) was excluded  from  
7 
8 the meta -analysis of the first time interval (birth – four weeks postpartum) because  participants  
9 
10 were assessed just three days after baseline. This post -intervention time period assessment  was 
11 
12 substantially shorter than the other studies entered for meta -analysis of the first time -interval  (see 
14 
15 follow -up time -points in Table 1) and this could significantly increase the risk of bias  in 
16 
17 assessing the interv al’s effect size (Portela et al.,  2015).  
18 
19 
20 The DerSimonian and Laird method was used (DerSimonian & Laird, 1986) to  conduct  
21 
22 the random effects model meta -analysis, where log -odds ratio where calculated and  transformed  
23 
24 back into odds rat io. Heterogeneity was calculated using I2 statistic, considering more than  50% 
26 
27 as substantial heterogeneity (Higgins & Green, 2011). Sources of heterogeneity were  explored  
28 
29 using the Galbraith chart. Publication bias was quantitatively evaluated  through Egger  and 
30 
31 Harbord tests (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997; Harbord, Egger, & Sterne, 2006).  Sub- 
32 
33 
34 group analyses were also conducted to investigate the influence that location may have on  the 
35 
36 effectiveness of the interve ntions. When possible univariate meta -regression were performed  in 
37 
38 order to identify the BCTs that may have an impact on the pooled effect size and  explore  
39 
40 potential sources of heterogeneity. We performed meta -regression analysis to assess the  impact  
42 
43 of number of interventions’ BCTs on each time intervals’ effect size (please see Table 2  for 
44 
45 number of BCTs per study). The meta -analyses were performed with STATA v.15  (StataCorp.,  
46

4 
5 at a cluster level (Higgins et al., 2011). For the non -randomized controlled trial the  ROBINS -I 
7 
8 tool was used (Sterne et al., 2016). Each reviewer assessed 10% of ot her reviewers’  quality

10 assessments and any discrepancies were resolved in a consensus meeting. There was  moderate  
11 
12 agreement between reviewers (IRR =  0.65).

15 In addition, the study quality was used for sensitivity analyses using studies wit h high  or 
16 
17 unclear risk of bias in more than half of the seven sources of bias (i.e. high or unclear risk  in 
19 
20 more than three sources). First, all studies were included in the meta -analysis and then  studies  
21 
22 with high or unclear risk of bia s were removed to assess any differences in effect  sizes.  
23 
24 Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to identify differences in effect sizes in terms  of 
26

4 
5 between 1987 and 2017 and included a total of 13.551 participants and with mean ages  between  
7 
8 17.4 and 36 years old. One of the RCTs had more than two arms (Fu et al., 2014). T hese were  
9 
10 analysed separately. Eighteen studies were conducted in industrialised countries  (U.S.A.,  
11 
12 Denmark, South Korea, Australia, Turkey, Canada, and France) and five in  non-industrialised  
14 
15 countries (Malaysia, Hong Kong, Brazil, China and Jordan). The classification was based on  the

17 Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) categorization  (The  
18 
19 Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD), 2018) and categorized  as

22 OECD and non -OEC D members countries. In the majority of studies ( n = 21, 91%)  mothers  
23

32 The characteristics of the interventions are described in Table 2 and more  detailed  
33 
34 
35 information on included studies are available in detail as Supplemental Material (Table A1).  The 
36 
37 majority of the interventions were delivered either face -to-face ( n = 9, 39%) or using  a 
38 
39 combination of face -to-face and telephone delivery methods by voice ( n = 9, 39%). Only  two 
40 
41 studies were delivered using telephone delivery alone ( n = 2, 9%) or online delivery alone ( n = 2, 
43 
44 9%), and only one intervention used a combina tion of the three delivery methods  (4%).  
45 
46 
47 The interventions lasted from one to 84 weeks with an average of 15 weeks (SD =  10.2).  
48 
49 The majority were delivered by a healthcare professional ( n = 18, 79%). There were four  studies  
50 
51 (17%) in wh ich a peer delivered the interventions, and one that used both professionals and  peer- 
52 
53 supporters (4%). The peer supporters were not always defined (Aksu, Küçük, & Düzgün,  2011;

20 BCTs’ Coding and Evidence  Synthesis  
21 
22 
23 The BCTs in each study are outlined in detail as Supplemental  Material (Table  A2). 
24 
25 There were 29 identified BCTs out of a total possible of 93 available in the taxonomy  (31.2%).  
27 
28 The number of BCTs within a single intervention ranged from two to seventeen with an  average  
29 
30 of approximately five (M = 4.56) per intervention. For studies examining exclusive  breastfeeding  
31 
32 the average BCTs used were also approximately five (M =  4.93).  
33 
34 
35 The most prevalent BCTs were ‘credible source’ ( n = 17, 74%), ‘instructions on how  to 
36 
37 perform the beh aviour’ ( n = 13, 57%), ‘unspecified social support’ ( n = 11, 48%),  ‘problem  
39 
40 solving’ ( n = 9, 39%), ‘demonstration of the behaviour’ ( n = 7, 30%), ‘feedback on behaviour’  (n 
41 
42 = 7, 30%), ‘information on social and environmental consequences’ ( n = 7, 30%)  and 
43 
44 ‘behavioural practice/rehearsal’ ( n = 5, 22%). Out of these most prevalent BCTs, the ones  which  
45 
46 
47 had lower confidence ratings from coders were ‘credible source’ (14 out of 17), ‘social  support  
48 
49 (unspecified)’ (8 out of 11), ‘ problem solving’ (7 out of 9), and ‘information about social  and 
50 
51 environmental consequences’ (5 out of 7). This suggests difficulty in specifying the presence  of 
52 
53 these BCTs in breastfeeding interventions. Among studies that assess exclusive  breastfeeding,

11 Risk of  Bias 
12 
13 
14 Overall the methodological quality of included studies varied between different  sources  
15 
16 of bias. The quality assessment (Higgins et al., 2011) of the twenty -two RCTs included in  the 
17 
18 revie w is outlined in Figure 2. The studies generally performed well on randomization  methods.  
20 
21 The majority had low risk of random sequence bias ( n = 17, 77%) and low risk because  of 
22 
23 allocation concealment ( n = 13, 59%). Moreover, only one study had  high risk on  random  
24 
25 sequence and two studies had high risk on allocation concealment. Also, the majority had  low 
27 
28 risk of attrition bias ( n = 17, 77%). On the other hand, the included studies performed less  well 
29 
30 on reporting and performa nce biases with ten studies having high risk of reporting bias  (45%)  
31 
32 and twelve having high risk of performance bias (55%). Overall eight studies (please see  Figure  
33 
34 
35 2) were considered as high or unclear risk of bias (assessed as having high or unclear bias in  >3 
36 
37 sources of bias). The non -randomised controlled trial (Kang et al., 2008) quality was  assessed  
38 
39 using the ROBIN -I tool and generally performed well expect for confounding and selection  bias 
40 
41 where it performed  moderat ely. 
43 
44 Furthermore, the included studies had several other specific methodological  limitations,  
45 
46 
47 which must be taken into account when interpreting the results of the review. These  include  
48 
49 using small convenience samples (Albert & Heinric hs-Breen, 2011; Porteous, Kaufman, &  Rush,  
50 
51 2000), sequential sampling (Albert & Heinrichs -Breen, 2011), no assessment of reasons  for 
52 
53 attrition (McLachlan et al., 2016; Tahir & Al -Sadat, 2013), the intervention not well described  or

13 Effectiveness of the Interven tions on Exclusive  Breastfeeding  
15 
16 The results of the meta -analysis suggest a significant effect of the interventions  at 
17 
18 different time -points after birth on promoting exclusive breastfeeding (see Figures 3a, 3b, 3c  and 
20 
21 3d for forest plot of effect sizes). The results are presented in the four intervals postpartum. Up  to 
22 
23 thirteen weeks postpartum, women enrolled in intervention conditions were twice as likely  to 
24 
25 continue with exclusive breastfeeding versus women enrolled in con trol conditions: up to  four 
27 
28 weeks (OR 1.94, [95% CI: 1.51 – 2.51]), five to eight weeks (OR 2.22, [95% CI: 1.48 – 3.34])  
29 
30 and nine to 12 weeks even if decreased compared to previous intervals remained high (OR  1.75,  
31 
32 [95% CI: 1.23 – 2.48]).  The effect beyond 13 weeks (OR 1.63, [95% CI =  1.07-2.47])  
33 
34 
35 postpartum slightly decreased. Across the different time points, subgroup  meta -analyses  
36 
37 suggested that interventions conducted in OECD countries might be more effective than  those  
38 
39 conducted in non -OECD countries (see sub -total ORs in Figures  3a-3d).

11 After carrying out univariate meta -regressions at the four time intervals, t esting  the 
12 
13 impact of BCTs on the effect sizes, only ‘social support (unspecified)’ at five to eight  weeks  
14 
15 significantly improved the effectiveness of the interventions ( z=2.23; p=. 025) and reduced  the 
16 
17 heterogeneity to ( I2= 42.05%). Havin g said that, given the small number of studies in  each 
19 
20 analysis (<10) together with diversity of studies, outliers (e.g. Kang et al., 2008; Gu et al.,  2016),  
21 
22 and the fact that the control groups differ across studies, the meta -regression analys es need to  be 
23 
24 interpreted with caution. In addition, the number of BCTs was not statistically significant in  any 
26 
27 interval (birth to four weeks: z = 1.13; p= 0.260, five to eight weeks: z = 0.11; p = 0.911, nine  to 
28 
29 twelve weeks: z = 0.97;  p = 0.333 and 13 weeks and beyond: z = 0.71; p =  0.476).  
30 
31 
32 The sensitivity analysis revealed that there was only a small impact on the  interventions’  
33 
34 effectiveness when excluding studies with high or unclear risk of bias, the non -RCT and  the 
35 
36 studies where we identified that the control group includes a BCT present in the  intervention

49 
50 breastfeeding only, eight assessing mixed breastfeeding only, and five that assessed both.  The

54 combined with telephone support, in co mparison to usual care which varied among studies  but

3 was usually much briefer, without follow up support. In total, 29 BCTs were identified in  the 
4 
5 included interventions. Meta -analyses showed t hat interventions were moderately effective  in 
7 
8 promoting exclusive breastfeeding, especially from birth to week thirteen postpartum.  This 
9 
10 together with recent findings on the importance of improving breastfeeding efficacy  highlights  
11 
12 the nee d of well -designed and theoretically informed breastfeeding interventions  (Brockway,  
14 
15 Benzies and Hayden, 2017). Interventions delivered in OECD countries seem to be  more  
16 
17 effective than those in non -OECD countries, but this preliminary finding r equires  further  
18 
19 investigation. Factors like peer pressure to introduce other liquid or solid foods, emotional  stress  
20 
21 
22 and lack of support in non -industrialised countries may explain this variation (Imdad, Yakoob,  & 
23 
24 Bhutta, 2011). There were also OECD countries with low breastfeeding rates like the UK  (Public  
25 
26 Health England, 2018) with no trial included in the  review.

32 The number of BCTs used in interventions did not impact effectivene ss. The  most  
33 
34 prevalent BCTs identified were ‘credible source’ and ‘instructions on how to perform  the 
35 
36 behaviour’. ‘Social support (unspecified)’ appeared to have an impact on exclusive  breastfeeding

41 component with five BCTs used on average in each intervention. This finding adds to  previous  
42 
43 evidence that increased breastfeeding is related to the emotional, tangible, and educational  social  
44 
45 
46 support from peers, family, friends and professionals (Raj & Plichta,  1998).  
47 
48 On the other hand, for more targeted and one -to-one interventions there are  additional  
50 
51 BCTs that are used in current interventions. Specifically, these additi onal BCTs include  ‘problem  
52 
53 solving’, ‘feedback and self -monitoring of behaviour’, ‘instructions on how to perform  the 
54 
55 behaviour’, ‘information about health, social and environmental consequences’,  ‘demonstrating

3 the behaviour’, ‘behavioural practice/rehearsal’, and ‘credible source’. Moreover, combining  lay 
4 
5 and peer -support with professional support can help disadvantaged women and women in  non- 
7 
8 industrialised countries to breastf eed (Dennis, 2002; Haroon, Das, Salam, Imdad, &  Bhutta,  
9 
10 2013). This suggests that a combined intervention including partners with wider  support  
11 
12 networks may be a novel and effective way to promote  breastfeeding.  
14 
15 There were also promising BCTs, which need to be further investigated, such as  ‘material  
16 
17 incentive’, and ‘material reward’. For example, one study (Washio et al., 2017) demonstrated  the 
19 
20 effectiveness of financial incentives provided within one month after delivery for  promoting  
21 
22 exclusive breastfeeding. Payments were provided at each session and for up to six months  if 
23 
24 breastfeeding was demonstrated in front of an expert. Replicating this BCT in  future  
26 
27 interventions will help establish reliability of t his effect in generalizing among different  groups  
28 
29 of mothers. Another approach that warrants further investigation is one whereby peers  (usually  
30 
31 women with previous breastfeeding experience) visit new mothers at home to  provide  
32 
33 
34 breastf eeding training within 3 days after child’s birth (Aksu et al., 2011), or to deliver  the 
35 
36 intervention during hospital stay (Dennis, Hodnett, Gallop, & Chalmers, 2002), and  facilitate  
37 
38 both links to community support surrounding breastfeeding alo ng with providing  breastfeeding  
39 
40 education (Pugh et al., 2010). Peer -support might be particularly important in low - and middle - 
42 
43 income countries where, unlike industrialised countries, breastfeeding support is not  necessarily  
44 
45 provided as  standard healthcare as evidenced elsewhere (Jolly et al.,  2012).

51 The majority of interventions were lengthy and had a face -to-face component, which  was

53 often combined with telephone support. In some studies that re ported a positive effect  on

3 followed by on -going support via telephone calls or home visits once they were  discharged.  
4 
5 These remote strategies may help sustain the effects of initially intensive  face-to-face 
7 
8 breastfeeding interventions. In addition, more advanced technology (e.g., smartphone  apps,  
9 
10 linkages between apps and electronic med ical records) could be leveraged to provide  sustained  
11 
12 access to medical information and peer support surrounding breastfeeding. Primary  care 
14 
15 educational programs with an online or telephone support component may provide an  optimal  
16 
17 contex t to initiate and to sustain engagement in interventions to promote breastfeeding (Guise  et 
18 
19 al., 2003).  
20 
21 
22 The interventions were mainly centred on individual behaviour and  individually  
23 
24 delivered, lacking a focus on cultural or social co ntext that may impact mothers’ decisions  to 
26 
27 breastfeed. For example, in one study (McLachlan et al., 2016), there were issues with  staff 
28 
29 availability in drop -in centres and thus contextual factors need to be taken into consideration  in 
30 
31 intervention development. It is important to note that the present review could not attest to  the 
32 
33 
34 impact of mode of delivery on interventions’ effectiveness due to the small number of  studies  
35 
36 with different delivery  modes.

41 The lack of reporting a theoretical framework in the majority of studies is problematic  in 
43 
44 terms of providing a systematic approach to the design and implementation of the  interventions,  
45 
46 as well as selecting an appropriate methodology  for evaluating the interventions’ impact  (French  
47 
48 et al., 2012). Moreover, a theoretical framework can also provide empirical support on  the 
50 
51 selection of included BCTs in each intervention. On the other hand, there is a possibility that  a 
52 
53 theoretical framework was used but not reported. Future studies may choose to  outline  
54 
55 specifically what theoretical framework they used and how it informed the intervention  design,

3 as theory -driven interventions are thought to have greater effectiveness for increasing  women’s  
4 
5 decision to breastfeed, and are more clearly defined and easier to evaluate relative  to 
7 
8 interventions not derived from theory (Dodgson et al., 2003; Giles et al. , 2014).  
9 
10 
11 Sustainability of Intervention  Effect  
12 
13 A few studies reported a declining of the intervention effect over time (Ahmed,  Roumani,  
15 
16 Szucs, Zhang, & King, 2016; Aksu et al., 2011; Frank, Wirtz, Sorenson, & Heeren, 1987; Gu  et 
17 
18 al., 2016; Kang et al., 2008; Washio et al., 2017). Similarly, this meta -analysis revealed  weaker  
19 
20 intervention effects on exclusive breastfeeding beyond thirteen weeks postpartum. The decline  of 
21 
22 
23 effect may reflect the fact that significant d ifferences in breastfeeding are seen early on when  the 
24 
25 intervention is most intensive and with regular and frequent social support with a credible  source  
26 
27 (Pugh et al., 2010). Having said this it is important to consider that our meta -analysis d oes not 
28 
29 suggest that the effect of intervention declines but rather that the differences  between  
31 
32 intervention and control over time are minimised. In one study (Fu et al., 2014) there was  some  
33 
34 effect of the intervention (especially telep hone support) at one and two months that did  not 
35 
36 remain significant at three months postpartum. Therefore, future interventions should  devise  
38 
39 strategies to maintain the intensity of intervention for a longer duration by incorporating  for 
40 
41 example more frequent  follow -ups. 
42 
43 
44 The larger effect early on also supports research suggesting that women may be  more  
45 
46 open to breastfeeding in the first weeks postpartum (Cohen, Brown, Rivera, & Dewey,  1999).  
47 
48 This is consistent with a recent review that found breastfeeding interventions effective  only 
50 
51 within one month postpartum (Park and Ryu, 2017). Therefore, future interventions should  be 
52 
53 initiated during the first week postpartum if not earlier, which tends to be a tim e of adjustment  
54 
55 but also where most women are able to focus on breastfeeding. Those initiating the  intervention

3 should also consider that women might be less likely to breastfeed if they miss t he opportunity  
4 
5 after baby’s  birth.  
7 
8 The decline of exclusive breastfeeding might be related to maternity leave, as return  to 
9 
10 
11 work may constitute a barrier to breastfeeding. Previous evidence indicates a positive  association  
12 
13 between du ration of breastfeeding and duration of leave and resumption of employment  within  
14 
15 the first year postpartum (Galtry, 2003). Thus, public health interventions at the workplace  as 
16 
17 well as substantial parental leave entitlement may both benefit b reastfeeding rates (Ruhm,  2000).  
19 
20 Methodological Considerations, Strengths and Limitations of the  Review  
21 
22 
23 Since our focus is ultimately on development of interventions for the promotion  of 
24 
25 healthy behaviours in women postpartum, this re view focused on studies that were  initiated  
27 
28 postpartum and therefore studies with interventions that were initiated during pregnancy  were  
29 
30 excluded. The decision to exclude studies initiated during pregnancy was a pragmatic  choice  
31 
32 taken pr ior the review process, as studies initiated during pregnancy were widely  heterogeneous,  
33 
34 
35 with a lack of postpartum follow up. Therefore, including interventions initiated  during  
36 
37 pregnancy would add to the heterogeneity of included interventi ons. Provided there are  enough  
38 
39 studies, a future complementary review may review interventions initiated during pregnancy  and 
40 
41 include postpartum follow -up. Moreover, breastfeeding was commonly assessed as  self-reported  
43 
44 by women and there  is a potential limitation of  inaccuracies.  
45 
46 
47 The extraction of BCTs was challenging since the content and procedures of  the 
48 
49 interventions were not always clearly described which is also evidenced in the literature  (Michie  
50 
51 et al, 2009). This is reflected in the quality assessment in terms of the high risk of reporting  bias 
52 
53 in almost half of the included studies. Therefore, there is a risk of inconsistency in defining  the 
55 
56 BCTs based on the intervention descriptions in the incl uded studies. For example, it was  difficult

2 
3 to ascertain whether ‘credible source’ BCT was used, as it was not always clear whether  the 
4 
5 provider was deemed credible from the mothers’ point of vi ew. It was also difficult to  specify  
7 
8 whether BCTs like ‘credible source’, ‘social support (unspecified)’, ‘information about  social  
9 
10 and environmental consequences’ and ‘problem solving’ were present since their  confidence  
11 
12 rating were low. O n the other hand, BCTs like ‘feedback on the behaviour’, ‘instructions on  how 
14 
15 to perform the behaviour’, ‘behavioural practice/rehearsal’, and ‘demonstration of the  behaviour’  
16 
17 were more clearly described and thus had higher confidence ratings. There were also a small  and 
18 
19 heterogeneous number of studies per interval to perform meaningful meta -regression or  sub- 
20 
21 
22 group analyses. Moreover, there were insufficient details regarding the BCTs to  assess  
23 
24 intervention efficacy in more  detail.  
25 
26 
27 As evidenced elsewhere (Michie et al, 2009) the published intervention descriptions  did 
28 
29 not always provide the level of detail required for BCT coding. In practice, more BCTs may  have  
30 
31 been used than those reported. We did not contact study authors, but for pragmatic reasons  did 
32 
33 
34 address this by following an inclusive approach in our coding. Thus, we included BCTs coded  as 
35 
36 probably present (+) in addition to those coded as definitely (++) present. In addition, a  second  
37 
38 coder provided 10% of data extraction for each intervention and a third reviewer was  involved  
39 
40 where necessary to resolve discrepancies in consensus meetings to ensure any relevant BCTs  had 
42 
43 been correctly  identified.  
44 
45 
46 There w as high heterogeneity in studies when analysing the intervals beyond four  weeks  
47 
48 postpartum and therefore the results of the meta -analysis at those intervals should be  interpreted  
49 
50 with caution. There were three studies (Ahmed et al., 2016; Aksu et al., 2011; Gu et al.,  2016)  
51 
52 that mainly contributed towards higher heterogeneity in those three intervals. This  heterogeneity  
54 
55 can also be explained by the diverse population, i.e., women from diverse ethnic  backgrounds

3 who hold different beliefs about breastfeeding (Celi, Rich -Edwards, Richardson, Kleinman,  & 
4 
5 Gillman, 2005). Moreover, the methods of outcome assessment, intervention delivery,  intensity  
7 
8 and length were also dive rse (see Supplemental Material for more information). One of  the 
9 
10 methodological issues that needs careful consideration in future research is the variation in  both 
11 
12 the primary outcome and the time -points these are assessed. On the other hand,  heterogeneity  
14 
15 was minimal when analysing studies in the first interval (birth – four weeks) and  thus 
16 
17 conclusions on the intervention effect immediately postpartum are reliable. The range  of 
18 
19 published dates may potentially add to heterogene ity of interventions since the WHO  Baby  
20 
21 
22 Friendly Initiative was introduced in 1991. However only two of the included studies  were  
23 
24 published prior to  1991.  
25 
26 
27 There were no unpublished studies included in this review and therefore we ar e aware  of 
28 
29 possible publication bias (J. P. Higgins & Green, 2011; Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007;  Lau, 
30 
31 Ioannidis, Terrin, Schmid, & Olkin, 2006). It was planned to analyse publication bias  through  
32 
33 
34 Egger and Harbord tests (Egger et al., 1997; Harbord et al., 2006). Nevertheless, as less than  10 
35 
36 studies were included in each interval meta -analysis these tests are not recommended given  their 
37 
38 lack of power. However, the search and screening for this review was rigorous to ensure that no 
39 
40 relevant studies were missed and that we report on the majority of evidence  regarding  
42 
43 interventions for mixed and exclusive breastfeeding. In addition, in order to ensure that  low 
44 
45 quality studies were not having an impact on the effect sizes, a sensitivity analysis  was 
46 
47 conducted by removing those studies with high risk of bias and then comparing the results  with 
49 
50 the initial  results.  
51 
52 Moreover, another limitation of this review is the initial moderate agreement  between  
54 
55 coders when coding the interventions’ BCTs. However, the method used for identifying  the

3 BCTs was empirically developed and similar reviews found similar agreement rates of k =  0.68 
4 
5 (Olander et al., 2013). A series of consensus meetings took place to discuss discrepancies and  in 
7 
8 most cases disagreements were attributable to the unclear intervention descriptions in  the 
9 
10 included studies. We recognize however that a number of B CTs may have been  misinterpreted  
11 
12 and that contacting authors would be an important strategy for future review  updates.  
14 
15 Finally, only three studies (Ahmed et al., 2016; Dennis et al., 2002; Tahir &  Al-Sadat,  
16 
17 2013) reported on the proport ion of women engaged in partial breastfeeding in the control  group  
19 
20 when assessing exclusive breastfeeding. This is problematic as knowledge about  partial  
21 
22 breastfeeding is helpful in interpreting the impact and effectiveness of the intervention.  For 
23 
24 example, when reporting that a number of women did not exclusively breastfeed in the  control  
26 
27 group, it is not clear whether these women were partially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding at  all 
28 
29 and how this compares to those in the i ntervention group. Moreover, the control procedures  were  
30 
31 usually described as ‘standard care,’ ‘routine care,’ or ‘usual care’ and studies varied in  how 
32 
33 
34 much detail was provided regarding procedures associated with the control group (see Tab le A1 
35 
36 in Supplemental Material for more information). Finally, we could not easily extract data  from  
37 
38 all included studies on important information that may impact breastfeeding like ethnicity  and 
39 
40 number of children. Researchers may consi der assessing and reporting this information to  help 
42 
43 with interpreting their findings. If number of studies allows, future reviews may also  provide  
44 
45 evidence on the impact of cultural variation on interventions’  effectiveness.

51 This review aimed to identify BCTs that could constitute components of  effective

3 monitoring, and providing the necessary support for women to continue breastfeeding.  Also,  
4 
5 broader community - and societal -level interventi ons can be used to influence  breastfeeding  
7 
8 behaviour, such as mass media messages (Wakefield, Loken, & Hornik, 2010).  Multifaceted  
9 
10 approaches are needed to promote exclusive breastfeeding that target individuals  and 
11 
12 communities to promote r elevant policies, such as the implementation of the WHO  Baby  
14 
15 Friendly initiative in practice (UNICEF,  2011).  
16 
17 There are a number of implications for research. Future studies should  consider  
19 
20 minimising the variation in both the primary out come and the time points these are  assessed.  
21 
22 Only a few studies assessed exclusive breastfeeding at a time point beyond six  months  
23 
24 postpartum and mixed breastfeeding beyond twelve months postpartum in order to  assess  
26 
27 whether the interven tions have any benefit according to the WHO guidelines (World  Health  
28 
29 Organization, 2011). It is recommended that future studies should include follow -up of at  least 
30 
31 six months for exclusive breastfeeding and twelve months or longer for mixed  breastfeeding.  
32 
33 
34 Future studies need to report on programme theory used during intervention development  and 
35 
36 clearly describe and define the core aspects of the intervention in order that BCTs, as the  active  
37 
38 ingredients of interventions can  be clearly reviewed and replicated. Additionally, future  studies  
39 
40 should focus on the sustainability of the interventions so that these follow -ups are  meaningful.  
42 
43 The low risk of attrition bias in the majority of the included studies is promis ing in this  respect.  
44 
45 
46 In terms of the analysis of the BCTs in breastfeeding promotion, the inclusion of  BCTs  
47 
48 may lead to the development of complex interventions where several components at  different  
49 
50 levels can influence the outcomes of  breastfeeding promotion programmes. More research in  this 
51 
52 area is required to determine the effectiveness of these interventions and identify the partial  value  
54 
55 of BCTs and their impact over the time. In addition, there is a methodological con sideration  from

3 this review in that future BCT meta -analyses can take into consideration the limitations  we 
4 
5 identified when performing meta -regression analyses with BCTs as predictors of pooled  effect  
7 
8 size. These include number of studies, research design and outcome diversity, outliers  with 
9 
10 adequate methodological quality as well as heterogeneity of control group procedures.  When  
11 
12 having enough studies, future reviews or updates m ay consider recommendations in terms  of 
14 
15 coding levels of BCT application (absence, partial application, consistent  application),  
16 
17 acknowledging contextual and co -occurrence factors and coding whether BCTs  occurred  
18 
19 uniquely in the control g roup (de Bruin, Viechtbauer, Hospers, Schaalma, & Kok, 2009;  de 
20 
21 
22 Bruin et al., 2010; Peters, De Bruin, & Crutzen,  2015).  
23 
24 An important analytic consideration from conducting this meta -analysis concerns the  use 
26 
27 of time postpartum as mode rator of the BCTs’ contribution to interventions’ effectiveness.  A 
28 
29 limitation of attempting to use time postpartum and BCTs as moderators in one  meta -regression  
30 
31 model is that some studies may have assessed breastfeeding at different time -points . As a  result,  
32 
33 
34 such a meta -regression would violate the independence of sample since the same  participants  
35 
36 would be used in different time -intervals in the same analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to  isolate  
37 
38 the effect of BCTs from th e effect of time postpartum in a meta -regression. Since this question  is 
39 
40 important we would suggest future researchers to collect primary longitudinal data and perform  a 
42 
43 time-series or survival analysis to examine the duration of time until BC Ts become  ineffective.  
44 
45 
46 Conclusions  
47 
48 Considered together, the studies included in the present review indicate that  interventions  
50 
51 are moderately effective at promoting exclusive breastfeeding immediate postpartum but that  this 
52 
53 effect declines thirteen weeks onwards in comparison to previous intervals. This has  explanatory  
54 
55 value in understanding why adherence to WHO recommendation for exclusive breastfeeding  for

3 six month s after birth is poor. Particularly, we identified no U.K. trials of  breastfeeding  
4 
5 interventions that were eligible for inclusion in our review, and it is noticeable that the U.K.  has 
7 
8 particularly low rates of exclusive or mixed breastfeeding. The re is an urgent need for  similar  
9 
10 trials in the U.K. Overcoming barriers of delivering effective breastfeeding interventions in  non- 
11 
12 industrialised countries is also  needed.  
14 
15 Furthermore, this review suggests that promoting exclusive breast feeding  among  
16 
17 postpartum women might be easier through channels that enable peer and professional  support.  
19 
20 This adds to a recent review which found postnatal education and support effective at  increasing  
21 
22 breastfeeding rates without howev er being able to identify the components of the  interventions  
23 
24 (Meedya, Fernandez and Fahy, 2017). On the other hand, promoting exclusive breastfeeding  may 
26 
27 also require interventions that employ BCTs to target cognitive and behavioural aspects of how 
28 
29 to perform breastfeeding, relevant consequences, and developing coping mechanisms for  dealing  
30 
31 with difficulties.

Risk of bias across studies  15 Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g. , publication bias, selective 
reporting within studies).  13 
Additional analyses  16 Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta -regression), if done, indicating 
which were pre -specified.  13-14 
RESULTS   
Study sele ction  17 Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at 
each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.  14, Figure 1  
Study characteristics  18 For each study, present characteristics for whic h data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow -up period) and 
provide the citations.  14-15 (Table  
1) 
Risk of bias within studies  19 Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item 12).  Figure 2  
Results of individual studies  20 For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each 
intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.  Figures 3a -d 
Synthes is of results  21 Present results of each meta -analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.  15-16 
Risk of bias across studies  22 Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item 15).  17 
Additional an alysis  23 Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta -regression [see Item 16]).  18-19 
DISCUSSION   
Summary of evidence  24 Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome;  consider their relevance to 
key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).  19-24 
Limitations  25 Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review -level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of 
identified researc h, reporting bias).  24 
Conclusions  26 Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.  29

Lactation counsellors 
(nurses with 
midwifery training)  
 
Training: The 12 
lactation counsellors 
had undergone  a 40 
hour lactation 
management and 
counselling course 
based on the WHO 
module and were 
given training 
guidance on how 
lactation counselling 
should be  performed, 
lactation counselling 
guideline booklets, 
standard operation 
procedure booklet, 
and a telephone  call Primary  
- Exclusive  BF rate at 
the first month 
postpartum was 
79.6%.  It dropped  to 
40.5% and 12.3% at 
the fourth and sixth 
months  postpartum  
- At the first month 
postpartum, a  higher 
number of mothers 
in the intervention 
group practiced 
exclusive BF 
compared to 
mothers in the 
control  group  (84.3% 
vs. 74.7%) with a 
small  effect  size (phi 
= 0.12).  At fourth  and 
sixth months 
postpartum there 
was no statistical 
difference  (42.0%  vs. 
39.0%; 12.5% vs.  
12.0%, respectively).  
 
Secondary  
- No difference 
between groups in 
terms  of stopping  BF. Well rec eived by the  
mothers at the 
beginning of the 
study, but the 
positive response to 
the intervention 
declined. The 
average of total 
minutes  for each  call 
per participant  was 
58.4 38.5 min 
(range  = 0–210 min), 
while the average 
number of successful 
calls per participant 
was only 4.33 3.14 
times/participant 
(range  0–12 times).

47 Note. EBF = exclusive breastfeeding; MBF = mixed breastfeeding.  
For Labarere et al (2005) other BCTs apart from credible source were apparent but not coded because they were not consistent as intervention was individualised dependent on  
need.  
For McLachlan (2016), action planning was administered ‘if needed’.
