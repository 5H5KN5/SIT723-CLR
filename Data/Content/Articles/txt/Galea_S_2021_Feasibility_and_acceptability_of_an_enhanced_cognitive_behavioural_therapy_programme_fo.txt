Abstract
Background: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most widely recognised and efficacious psychological
therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adults. However, suboptimal remission rates indicate
room for improvement in treatments, particularly when both children and their parents have anxiety disorders.
Bidirectional transmission and maintenance of anxiety within parent –child dyads could be better targeted by CBT,
to improve treatment outcomes for children and parents with anxiety disorders. This study aimed to develop and
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a concurrent parent –child enhanced CBT intervention that targets the
individual ’s anxiety disorder(s), as well as the bidirectional factors that influence and maintain anxiety in the dyad.
Methods: Feasibility and acceptability of the proposed CBT protocol will be evaluated in an open-label pilot trial of the
intervention utilising qualitative and quantitative data collection. Ten parent –child dyad participants ( n= 20) with
anxiety disorders will be recruited for the proposed intervention. The intervention is based on an empirically supported
10-week CBT programme for anxiety disorders in adults, adapted to be delivered to parent –child dyads concurrently,
and to target anxious modelling and overprotective behaviours through joint observational exposures. Intervention
feasibility will be explored by pre-post symptom change on a range of clinician- and self-report measures to determine
preliminary indications of participants ’intervention response and effect size calculations to estimate sample size for a
future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT). Additional feasibility measures will include recruitment rates,
completion rates, and adherence to programme requirements. To explore participant acceptability of the intervention,
qualitative interviews will be conducted with five parent –child dyads who complete the intervention ( n=1 0 ) ,a l o n g
with five parent –child dyads with anxiety symptoms who express interest in the intervention ( n= 10). Acceptability
measures will include prospective and retrospective quantitative self-report and qualitative interview data.

Background
Anxiety disorders are amongst the most prevalent class
of mental health disorders in adults and children [ 1,2].
They often first occur in childhood and continue into
adulthood if untreated [ 3]. Across the lifespan, the
presence of clinical anxiety is associated with poorer
outcomes in interpersonal, academic, occupational, and
health domains [ 4,5]. Cognitive behavioural therapy
(CBT) is recognised as the most efficacious and cost-
effective psychological treatment for anxiety disorders in
adults and children [ 6–8]. Despite its extensive evidence
base, recent meta-analytic results of CBT for anxiety dis-
orders reported mean remission rates of approximately
50% in adults and children [ 9,10]. These modest re-
sponse rates suggest significant scope for improvement
of treatment outcomes [ 6,11]. Given the prevalence of
anxiety disorders and associated negative impacts for in-
dividuals and society [ 4,12,13], further research refining
and trialling efficacious CBT protocols targeting anxiety
is warranted.
The link between parental anxiety and the develop-
ment and maintenance of anxiety disorders in children
is widely reported. Several clinical trials of CBT for
treating child anxiety disorders have found that having a
parent with clinical levels of anxiety can significantly re-
duce CBT effectiveness, as assessed by pre-post clin-
ician- and self-report measures of anxiety severity [ 14–
18]. In addition to parental psychopathology, various
parenting factors have been proposed to mediate par-
ent –child anxiety transmission, and contribute to poorer
treatment outcomes in children. These parenting factors
include rejection, overprotection, accommodation, par-
ent cognitions of child competence, modelling of anx-
iety, and information transfer [ 19–21]. Of these factors,
parental modelling of anxiogenic responses and overpro-
tective parenting behaviours have been most consistently
associated with child anxiety [ 22,23], with growing evi-
dence emerging for the role of parental accommodation
in maintaining the child ’s anxiety [ 24]. Specifically, par-
ents with anxiety are more likely to model avoidance
and show increased sensitivity to child distress and in-
creased apprehension when their child engages in age-appropriate tasks [ 25]. When repeatedly exposed to par-
ents ’anxious responses, children may vicariously learn to
respond in similarly anxious ways [ 26,27]. Overprotective
parenting increases children ’sr i s ko fd e v e l o p i n ga n x i e t y
disorders [ 22], by reducing opportunities to develop self-
confidence and adaptive coping behaviours in new or
challenging situations [ 28–30]. This in turn maintains the
anxiety, as children form negative cognitions of being un-
able to cope, and increasingly avoid threatening stimuli
[30,31].
While less is known about the impacts of child anxiety
on parent anxiety treatment outcomes, a growing body
of research suggests that the presence of child anxiety
can impact on anxiety in parents. A study investigating
interactions in mother –child dyads indicated that
anxious and non-anxious mothers of anxious children
expressed greater catastrophising cognitions compared
to anxious and non-anxious mothers of children without
anxiety disorders [ 32]. Other studies investigating bidir-
ectional anxiety relationships in parent –child dyads
found that post-treatment reductions of children ’s anx-
iety symptoms were associated with later reductions in
parental anxiety [ 33], and overprotective and controlling
parenting behaviours [ 34]. Similarly, other research has
indicated that higher child anxiety predicted greater par-
ental control [ 35], over involvement [ 36,37], and paren-
tal accommodation [ 38]. Taken together, this body of
research indicates that the presence of anxiety in a child,
irrespective of their parent ’s psychopathology, may
influence behavioural responses and anxiety symptoms
in parents.
Despite evidence for bidirectional influences of anxiety
disorders in parent –child dyads, most prior research has
typically involved parents as co-facilitators in child anx-
iety treatment [ 39–41] but has neglected to adequately
address anxiety in parents [ 42]. However, there have
been three notable exceptions to date which have exam-
ined whether targeting anxiety in parents might improve
child CBT outcomes. In two randomised controlled tri-
als (RCT) of CBT for child anxiety disorders, Cobham
et al. [ 17] and Hudson et al. [ 14] included an adjunct
parental anxiety management (PAM) programme toGalea et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:109 Page 2 of 12
treat co-occurring parental anxiety. While results of the
Cobham study indicated PAM initially improved diag-
nostic outcomes for children with an anxious parent
compared to control, significant differences in treatment
outcome were not maintained at 6- and 12-month
follow-up. Similarly, Hudson reported that the addition
of PAM conferred non-significant differences in remis-
sion rates for child primary anxiety diagnosis compared
to child-CBT alone at post-treatment and 6-month
follow-up. Furthermore, adjunct PAM did not improve
self-reported anxiety symptoms [ 17] or remission rates
for parents with an anxiety disorder [ 14] at post-
treatment or follow-up. These findings suggest that the
brief PAM sessions were insufficient for treating parent
psychopathology. An evidence-based treatment such as
CBT may be required to target parental anxiety, to in
turn improve CBT outcomes for children with anxiety
disorders.
The third study was a comprehensive three-arm RCT
where children received CBT and their mothers were
assigned to either maternal-CBT conducted 8 weeks
prior to their child ’s CBT, a concurrent mother –child
interaction (MCI) intervention, or maternal active con-
trol [ 20]. The MCI intervention was designed to reduce
potentially anxiogenic dynamics within the parent –child
relationship and to increase maternal autonomy-
promoting cognitions and behaviours. The maternal ac-
tive control condition involved sessions which promoted
family physical health behaviours. Results indicated the
addition of maternal-CBT, or MCI intervention did not
significantly improve outcomes for children beyond
child-CBT alone. Additionally, mothers treated with
CBT initially showed greater primary anxiety disorder
remission than mothers in the MCI or active control
conditions; however, this effect was no longer significant
after children received CBT. Maternal-CBT results were
not maintained following child-CBT as reductions in
child anxiety led to reductions in mothers ’anxiety symp-
toms across conditions. While this result supports the
bidirectional influence of child anxiety, the reported pri-
mary anxiety disorder remission rates for mothers across
conditions ranged from 39.4 to 57.8%, consistent with
meta-analytic adult CBT remission rates [ 9]. Therefore,
a further scope for the improvement of parent treatment
outcomes exists. Additionally, while the inclusion of
evidence-based treatment for anxiety in parents takes a
positive direction, the non-significant differences between
treatment arms suggest that treating mothers 8-weeks
prior to children may not have adequately intervened with
bidirectional factors maintaining anxiety disorders within
the dyad. Furthermore, since anxiogenic parent –child in-
teractions are known risk factors for child anxiety [ 22,26,
27] and appear to contribute to the bidirectional nature of
anxiety maintenance within the dyad [ 32–34], targetinganxiogenic interactions concurrently with CBT for child
and parent anxiety may achieve stronger effects for parent
and child anxiety treatment outcomes.
While substantial evidence indicates bidirectional asso-
ciations maintain anxiety in parent –child dyads, the im-
pact of these bidirectional factors has not been
adequately catered for by existing treatment protocols.
Hence, we propose a treatment approach that targets
anxiety symptomatology in both parents and children, as
well as bidirectional factors which maintain and exacer-
bate anxiety disorders within the parent –child dyad via
graded exposure techniques. The proposed protocol is
adapted from an existing transdiagnostic CBT manual
[43], which has demonstrated successful pre-post
treatment outcomes in several previous clinical trials
[44–46]. This manual was chosen to facilitate a concur-
rent treatment format for children and parents regardless
of their specific anxiety diagnoses. To ensure alignment of
treatment approaches and consistent session content for
both members of the dyad, the original adult protocol was
modified for child participants rather than utilising an
existing child CBT protocol for anxiety. The process of
adapting the original protocol for children involved exten-
sive developmentally appropriate translations based on
knowledge of the cognitive and emotional developmental
stages of the target treatment population. Additionally,
feedback on a preliminary version of the adapted protocol
was provided by primary school-aged children to ensure
that content was ‘child-friendly ’and comprehensible. Sub-
sequently, the following major adaptations and additions
to the original protocol were made: (1) the development
of a child-version of the adult protocol, (2) addition of
psychoeducation and cognitive strategies for parents
targeting bidirectional factors which maintain anxiety
within the dyad, and (3) incorporation of joint observa-
tional exposure sessions.
The joint observational exposures are considered the
key component of the proposed intervention and to our
knowledge has not been undertaken as a component of
CBT previously. In the joint observational exposure ac-
tivities, the parent will undertake an individual exposure
while being observed by the child. Following this, the
child will participate in an exposure activity while the
parent observes. Neither dyad member will be directly
involved in the other ’s exposure; however, after acting as
observers, both the parent and child will complete
post-exposure reviews separately with their individual
therapist to reflect on new evidence that emerged
from observing the exposures.
Grounded in Bandura ’s social learning theory [ 47] and
the recognised impacts of parental modelling on anxiety
transmission in their children [ 19,36,48], joint exposures
allow parents to model alternative adaptive coping behav-
iours to their child. Through observation, it is expectedGalea et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:109 Page 3 of 12
that the child will vicariously learn that experiencing anx-
iety is normal and manageable, thus increasing percep-
tions of self-efficacy and coping ability. Additionally, as
parental anxiogenic cognitions are both a known risk
factor for anxiety in children and a maintenance factor for
anxiety in parents [ 32,36], by observing their child, parent
cognitions about the child ’s coping ability and resili-
ence may be modified. It is subsequently anticipated
that modified parent cognitions will lead to reduc-
tions in overprotective and accommodating behav-
iours. Furthermore, as silent observers, parents
practice regulating their own physiological anxiety re-
sponse and behavioural impulses to overprotect. We
anticipate that this adapted exposure approach will
significantly improve treatment outcomes for parents
and children with anxiety disorders.
In line with guidance from the Medical Research
Council on the development and implementation of
complex intervention [ 49], the current study is an ini-
tial step in determining if the proposed enhanced
intervention is feasible and acceptable for parent –
child dyads with anxiety disorders. A mixed-methods
approach was chosen to explore preliminary indica-
tions of participants ’intervention response and to in-
clude the essential contribution of the client voice,
which provides a richer understanding of participants ’
programme acceptability [ 50]. In accordance with the
CONSORT extension for pilot and feasibility trials
[51], trial feasibility asks questions related to whether
a future trial can be done, should be done, and how.
To address feasibility, the present study includes a
calculation of effect size estimates for outcome mea-
sures to estimate the sample size of a future definitive
RCT [ 51]. Further, feasibility will be assessed via
recruitment rate, completion rate, and adherence to
study requirements. Trial acceptability will be exam-
ined within the theoretical framework of acceptability
as outlined by Sekhon et al. [ 52]. This framework de-
fines acceptability as consisting of multiple compo-
nents that reflect clients ’anticipated (prospective) or
experiential (retrospectiv e) responses to an interven-
tion [ 52]. The seven component constructs outlined
in the framework include affective attitude, perceived
effectiveness, burden, self-efficacy, ethicality, interven-
tion coherence, and opportunity costs [ 52]. Outcomes
of the pilot feasibility and acceptability trial will in-
form whether to proceed with a powered randomised
controlled trial to determine treatment efficacy and
intervention validation in the future.
To the best of our knowledge, the proposed protocol
is the first to concurrently treat parents and children
with anxiety disorders, and to utilise a joint observa-
tional exposure format. The overarching aims of this
study are as follows:1) Assess study feasibility through investigation of:
a. Variability in clinician-report and self-report
outcome measures to determine preliminary
indications of participants ’intervention
response;
b. Effect size calculations to estimate the sample
size of a future definitive RCT;
c. Percentages of recruitment rate, completion
rate, and adherence to study requirements.
2) Explore participants ’prospective and retrospective
acceptability of the enhanced programme using
quantitative self-report and qualitative interview
data collection methods.
Method
Study design and setting
Feasibility and acceptability of the protocol will be evalu-
ated utilising a mixed-methods design, encompassing
qualitative and quantitative data collection. The inter-
vention component is an open-label pilot trial (hereafter
referred to as 'the intervention'), utilising a pre-test –
post-test within-groups design to obtain an effect size
estimate for future RCT planning. The intervention will
be conducted in person at the Monash University psych-
ology training clinic. Acceptability of the protocol will
also be investigated with qualitative interviews of parent
and child dyads. All qualitative interviews will be con-
ducted remotely via video conferencing software.
Participants and sample size
The intended intervention sample will be 10 parent –
child dyads ( n= 20). This sample size is recommended
by Birkett and Day [ 53] as sufficient for a pilot feasibility
trial effect size estimate in advance of conducting a pow-
ered RCT. Parent participants will be adults 18 years
and older, while child participants will be aged 6 –12
years. The parent participant is defined as the biological
parent and/or primary caregiver of the child participant.
For the qualitative interviews, approximately 10 parent –
child dyads ( n= 20) will participate; however, a slightly
higher number of dyads may be recruited to achieve data
saturation. Purposive sampling will be utilised to gather
a diverse range of consumer perspectives. Therefore,
participants will include five dyads ( n= 10) that have
completed the intervention to determine retrospective
acceptability, and five dyads ( n= 10) that express inter-
est in participating to evaluate prospective acceptability.
Eligibility criteria
For the intervention
Parent –child dyads (child age range 6 –12 years) must
both meet criteria for a primary diagnosis of an anxiety
disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ,
5thedition (DSM-5) [ 54]. Clinician-admini stered diagnosticGalea et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:109 Page 4 of 12
interviews will be undertaken pr ior to the intervention phase
of the study to assess for current primary anxiety disorder
diagnoses in both dyad members (see ‘Pre-intervention
assessment ’, below). Dyads who present with a principal
DSM-5 diagnosis other than an anxiety disorder, any
other condition of sufficient severity that requires
immediate clinical prioritisation, e.g. suicidality and
neurocognitive impairment, or insufficient English
ability, will be excluded from the study and referred to
appropriate alternative services.
For the qualitative data
As participants who complete the study protocol have
previously met intervention eligibility criteria, the only
additional requirement is the completion of the inter-
vention. For parent –child dyads who express interest in
the intervention, additional eligibility requirements are
that they self-report current anxiety symptoms and have
not previously participated in the intervention. Exclusion
criteria for the qualitative study are the same as those
specified for the intervention.
Recruitment and screening
Potential participants will be recruited via promotional
study flyers sent to local schools for dissemination
amongst school mental health and wellbeing staff, and
publication in school newsletters. Additionally, paid
targeted advertising on social media will be utilised.
Promotional material will contain a link to an electronic
expression-of-interest form. Interested parents will be
contacted by study researchers to complete a brief
phone screening. For the intervention, potentially eli-
gible parent –child dyads will be invited to participate in
a formal diagnostic pre-intervention assessment. Ineligible
families as indicated by the phone screening will be pro-
vided with information to access alternative psychological
support, if required. For the qualitative interviews, dyads
who previously participated in the intervention or who
had expressed interest in being involved will be invited to
participate. Following phone screening, eligible families
will submit online informed consent prior to their
interviews.
Pre-intervention assessment
Prior to conducting the pre-intervention assessment,
parents and children will be provided with detailed age-
appropriate explanatory statements, and informed
consent and assent to participate will be obtained. The
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM (ADIS-5)
[55] for parents and the Anxiety Disorders Interview
Schedule for DSM Child and Parent Versions (ADIS-IV-
CP) [ 56] for children will be administered to determine
presence of a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis. The
adult and child versions of the Columbia-SuicideSeverity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) [ 57] will be administered
to parents and children respectively, to determine risk
status. Following the diagnostic interviews, parent –child
dyads will be invited to attend a feedback session to
discuss assessment results and treatment recommenda-
tions. Ineligible dyads will be presented with options for
referral and/or alternative treatment recommendations.
Eligible dyads will be invited to participate in the
intervention.
Qualitative interview procedure
All interviews will be conducted via video conferencing
software at times convenient to families. The parent
interviews will be conducted in two parts, with part 1
(parent focus) administered by SG and immediately
followed by part 2 (child focus) administered by CS.
Child interviews will be undertaken separately to the
parent interview, by CS. It is anticipated that children
will be interviewed independently of their parent; how-
ever, parents will be permitted to sit in on the interview
if requested. Parents who elect to sit in on child inter-
views will be asked not to provide input to interview
content. Parent interviews are estimated to take 60 –90
min; child interviews will be approximately 30 min. For
dyads who participated in the intervention, interviews
will be conducted following the conclusion of the inter-
vention. Dyads who have not participated in the inter-
vention will be interviewed as they are recruited. All
dyads will receive a $30 gift card as reimbursement for
their time participating in the interviews.
Intervention
The concurrent intervention will consist of ten treat-
ment sessions. Sessions will be conducted individually,
with one therapist, although some intervention activities
will be shared experiences involving the dyad and two
therapists. Sessions will occur weekly and last for 60 min
each. Intervention content follows a typical CBT format
of psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure,
and relapse prevention, with homework assigned and
reviewed weekly (see Table 1for intervention content
outline). The following major adaptations and additions
to the original protocol [ 43] were made to tailor the
intervention for parent –child dyads:
(1) Child-version of the adult protocol: modifications
included extensive changes in language and
simplification of some CBT concepts to
accommodate the developmental stage and
cognitive abilities of the target participant age
group. To increase programme appeal, vignettes
with child-relevant content, diagrams, and
illustrations; a workbook with colourful worksheets
and handouts; and a rewards chart to monitor andGalea et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:109 Page 5 of 12
acknowledge progress were included in the child
treatment manual. Appropriate rewards for com-
pleting treatment components will be individually
negotiated between the parent and child.
(2) Additional psychoeducation for parents on
bidirectional factors: specifically, psychoeducation
on the impact of overprotection, accommodation,
and modelling anxious behaviours on child anxiety.
These modifications are illustrated by vignettes
specific to the parent –child dyad.
(3) Content modifications to address anxiogenic
cognitions related to the parenting role: cognitive
restructuring tasks to identify bidirectional anxiety
maintenance factors and normalise anxiogenic
cognitions in the dyad.
(4) Joint observational exposure sessions: during joint
observational exposures, dyad members act as silent
observers of each other ’s exposure. For example, a
child may observe his parent with social anxiety
disorder initiating a conversation with a stranger,
while a parent may observe her daughter with
selective mutism read a page of a storybook aloud
to the therapist. For parents, cognitive restructuring
is undertaken prior to observing their child. This
includes identifying cognitions about their child ’sexpected performance and coping ability, and the
parent ’s ensuing overprotective response. Following
joint observational exposures, both dyad members ’
complete post-exposure reviews to identify when
the other member successfully modelled adaptive
coping behaviours, and to reflect on new evidence
to challenge prior anxious assumptions.
Data collection
Participants will complete self-report feasibility and
acceptability measures using paper versions of all
questionnaires. Verbal assistance may be provided by
clinicians to enhance child participants ’comprehen-
sion of self-report questionnaires, if required. Admin-
istration time-points for all clinician assessments and
self-report measures are listed in Table 2.
Feasibility measures
In line with the CONSORT definition of a pilot trial
[51], estimates of variability for the following outcome
measures which are planned to be administered in a
future RCT will be utilised in the current study.
These measures will provide preliminary indications
of participants ’intervention response and enableTable 1 Intervention content

effect size calculations to inform the sample size for a
future definitive RCT:
The ADIS Clinician Severity Rating (CSR) [ 55,56] will
be used to quantify anxiety disorder symptom severity
and impairment for both parent and child participants.
A CSR rating of ≥4 (moderate psychopathology) is con-
sidered to meet the threshold for a clinically significant
diagnosis [ 56]. The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)
[58] will be utilised to specify parent and child partici-
pant illness severity (CGI-S) and clinical improvement
or worsening (CGI-I) in comparison to baseline presen-
tation. Participant self-report of pre- and post-treatment
anxiety symptoms will be assessed using the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory child (STAIC-S) [ 59] and adult
(STAI-S) [ 60] versions. Table 2summarises all outcome
measures and assessment time-points.
Fluctuations in self-reported anxiety symptom severity
throughout the course of the intervention will be moni-
tored using the STAIC-S and STAI-S. Parent ratings of
child anxiety symptoms will be captured using the Child
Behaviour Checklist Anxiety Subscale (CBCL/6-18-A)
[61]. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) [ 62] and
Beck Youth Inventories (BYI-2) [ 63] will be used to
determine recent depressive symptoms in adults, and
depression, anxiety, anger, disruptive behaviour, and
self-concept in children. Quality of life across broad life
domains will be evaluated using the World Health
Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version
(WHOQOL-BREF) [ 64] and KIDSCREEN-27 [ 65].
Parenting-related symptoms and behaviours will be
assessed with the Parental Stress Scale (PSS) [ 66], the
Parent Worry Measure (PWM) [ 67], and Parental Over-
protection Measure (POM) [ 68].
Recruitment rates will be determined by the propor-
tion of dyads who meet the intervention eligibility
criteria and consent to enter the trial. We will consider
the success threshold for recruitment rates ≥70%. The
proportion of dyads that consent and remain partici-
pants at the end of the defined study period will be used
to evaluate completion rates, with ≥80% considered
feasible. Adherence to study requirements includes dyad
completion of homework tasks, as well as completion of
clinician and self-report questionnaires at defined
assessment time-points. For all adherence measures,
the success threshold will be ≥80%.
Acceptability measures
Considered within the conceptual framework of health-
care intervention acceptability as defined by Sekhon
et al. [ 52], participants ’acceptability of the intervention
will be explored utilising the following quantitative and
qualitative measures:
The Session Rating Scale child (CSRS) [ 69] and adult
versions (SRS) [ 70] will be utilised to assess participants ’perspectives across key treatment dimensions. Partici-
pants ’perceptions of therapy helpfulness and credibility
related to specific CBT components will be rated with
the Therapy Helpfulness Feedback Questionnaire (THQ)
[71]. Additionally, five open questions to elicit feedback
related to the intervention experience and engaging in
observational exposures are included. Child participants
will complete a modified language version of the adult
THQ. Parents will complete the Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire (CSQ-8) [ 72], which will measure their
satisfaction with the intervention.
Qualitative interviews will be conducted to explore
participants ’prospective and retrospective acceptability.
Topics of interest covered in the interview questions will
be (1) perceptions of the overall enhanced intervention
experience and (2) acceptability of adapted intervention
components, with a focus on the novel exposures.
Additionally, parents will be asked questions pertaining
to (3) the bidirectional influence of anxiety between par-
ent and child, as this relationship is considered a key
conceptual underpinning of the enhanced protocol. Part
1 of the parent interview asks about their experience,
while part 2 enquires about parents ’perspectives of their
child ’s experience. Separate versions of questions were
developed contingent upon participants ’previous in-
volvement in the intervention.
Data collection
The diagnostic assessments, intervention, and qualitative in-
terviews will be conducted by CS and SG, both provisional
psychologists and advanced Doct or of Psychology (Clinical)
post-graduate students. CS and SG have prior clinical ex-
perience in the provision of ge neral and transdiagnostic
CBT techniques. Regular oversight and supervision will be
provided from two registered p sychologists with extensive
experience in clinical practic e and research, KL and MY. In
addition, an external expert in p arenting and qualitative re-
search methods will be regular ly consulted throughout the
iterative processes of the interview schedule development,
qualitative data collection, and analysis.
Prior training will be conducted to achieve inter-rater
reliability greater than 80% for ADIS diagnostic assess-
ments. KL will randomly review 20% of diagnostic inter-
views and intervention videos, to provide supervision,
ensure assessment and treatment fidelity, and to prevent
clinician drift. To preclude the potential for clinician
bias during the collection of pre- to post-intervention
outcome measures, the same clinician will not deliver
the intervention and conduct the diagnostic assess-
ments for an individual client. SG will conduct the child
assessments and deliver parent intervention, while CS will
conduct the parent assessments and deliver child
intervention.Galea et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:109 Page 8 of 12
Data management
Participant data will be de-identified and labelled using
unique alphanumeric codes. All interviews and intervention
sessions will be video/audio recorded. Qualitative interviews
will be transcribed verbatim using an electronic transcrip-
tion programme. QSR International ’sN V i v o[ 73]w i l lb e
used to store and organise qua litative study material to aid
in data analysis. All study elect ronic data including record-
ings and transcriptions will be password protected and
stored on a secure research drive only accessible to the
study researchers. Hard-copy files will be stored in locked
filing cabinets at the study site. Double data entry will be
conducted for 10% of participan t questionnaires to promote
data quality. For the clinical trial, all raw data pertaining to
parents will be stored for 7 years from the last encounter,
as required by law. All raw data pertaining to child partici-
pants will be stored until th e child attains the age of 25
years. For the qualitative study, all digital data collected will
be permanently deleted 5 year s after the last publication
from this research.
Data analysis plan
To assess feasibility related to preliminary indications of
participants ’intervention response and effect size
calculation, repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANO-
VAs) will be conducted between pre- and post-treatment
for outcome measures of the CSR, CGI, STAI-S, and STAI
C-S. Repeated measures ANOVAs will be utilised to
analyse pre-, mid-, and post-treatment scores on outcome
measures of BDI-II, WHOQOL-BREF, PSS, PWM, and
POM, and the BYI-2, KIDSCREEN-27, and CBCL/6-18-A.
Prior to analysis, data will be screened and relevant as-
sumptions checked. For rep eated-measures ANOVAs, par-
tial eta-squared will be calculated as the measure of effect
size. Descriptive statistics and visual inspection of scatter
plots will be reported session-by-session on the STAI-S and
STAIC-S. The feasibility measures of recruitment rates,
completion rates, and adherence to study requirements will
be determined by calculating the percentages of these mea-
sures throughout the study period.
Acceptability will be assessed utilising a mixed-
methods approach. Descriptive statistics of participants ’
ratings on the quantitative measures of CSQ-8, THQ,
and SRS will be reported. Qualitative interviews will be
analysed utilising reflexive thematic analysis [ 74].
Accordingly, full interview transcripts will be repeatedly
reviewed for data familiarisation; initial codes will be
generated, followed by collating codes into themes,
refining themes, and finally defining themes and
sub-themes [ 74]. The qualitative analysis will be
undertaken utilising an iterative review process in
collaboration with super visors MY, KL, and research
collaborators.Possible harms
Potential harms of being involved in the intervention
and qualitative interviews will be explicitly outlined in
the participant explanatory statements. The primary po-
tential risk for participants is experiencing psychological
distress during assessment, intervention, or interview
procedures; however, this is not anticipated to exceed
levels of psychological distress typically experienced in
their daily lives. To minimise risk of harms, participants
will be informed that they may freely withdraw their par-
ticipation from any procedure at any time. Further, a
range of psychological support options, including 24-h
crisis support, will be discussed with participants prior
to their involvement. All study clinicians and inter-
viewers are experienced working with individuals with
anxiety and other emotional problems, and in respond-
ing to distress. Adverse events to participants (e.g. sig-
nificant symptom deterioration, suicidal ideation or
attempt, reported or observed abuse) will be monitored
routinely throughout the study. Any adverse events will
be immediately reported to the principal study investiga-
tor, KL, and specific harm minimisation and prevention
protocols will be enacted.
Ethics approval and dissemination
All study procedures will be conducted in accordance
with the Monash University Human Research Ethics
Committee approval (project ID 9781). Study results will
be disseminated through peer-reviewed scientific jour-
nals. Two publications are expected, one reporting inter-
vention and qualitative outcomes for parents and the
second reporting these outcomes for child participants.
Discussion
This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility and ac-
ceptability of an enhanced parent –child intervention
which augments standard CBT to include treatment
components targeting bidirectional maintenance factors
of anxiety in parent –child dyads. In addition to evaluat-
ing the overall intervention feasibility and acceptability,
this study will specifically explore participant responses
to the novel intervention component of joint observa-
tional exposures. The results of this trial will inform the
development and implementation of a future definitive
RCT to evaluate intervention efficacy.
We anticipate that participating in the intervention
will result in short-term improvements in symptomatol-
ogy from pre- to post-treatment. Additionally, we expect
that feasibility estimates for completion, recruitment,
and adherence will be met, and results of outcome mea-
sures will enable an effect-size estimation for future
RCT planning [ 53]. It is also anticipated that parent and
child participants will prospectively and retrospectively
find the overall intervention and joint observationalGalea et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:109 Page 9 of 12
exposures acceptable. The qualitative component pro-
vides a unique opportunity to gain a rich perspective of
consumers ’experience and acceptability, to inform fu-
ture planning and trialling of the enhanced intervention.
The broader study implications may highlight the im-
portance of targeting bidirectional maintenance factors
in subsequent research exploring treatment of anxiety
disorders in this population.
While recognising the potential implications of this re-
search, the limitations must be acknowledged. A limita-
tion of the proposed open-label design is that it lacks a
control condition. Accordingly, we are unable to draw
definitive conclusions regarding the short-term benefits
of the intervention. Additionally, as a mixed-methods
approach will be utilised to investigate intervention ac-
ceptability, qualitative findings cannot be generalised to
a broader population. Nevertheless, despite the inherent
limitations of the intended methodology, this research
proposes an important initial step prior to conducting a
definitive RCT [ 49] to determine the efficacy of the en-
hanced CBT intervention for anxiety in parent –child
dyads.
Trial status
This research study was prospectively registered with
the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
