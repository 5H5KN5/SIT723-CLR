Abstract
Introduction: An active play is designed to increase children ’s physical activity levels and fundamental movement
skills through outdoor play and is well-suited to the needs of children with intellectual disabilities. However, no
active play interventions have included children with intellectual disabilities. This study aims to investigate the
feasibility of a school-based active play intervention for children with intellectual disabilities.
Method: Children aged 7 –12 years who had intellectual disabilities and were independently ambulatory were
eligible. This single-group 17-week intervention was implemented in two additional support needs schools. It
consisted of a weekly 1-h active play session incorporating 30 min of structured games and 30 min of free play.
Feasibility of recruitment/retention, adherence, and outcome measures were investigated. Outcome measures
included school-based physical activity (ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer), fundamental movement skills (Test of
Gross Motor Development-2), and social interactions (Playground Observation of Peer Engagement). Staff feedback
was collected via open-ended questionnaire. Feasibility was investigated using descriptive statistics and
questionnaire data analyzed using thematic analysis. Potential pre-post changes were investigated for school-based
physical activity, fundamental movement skills, and social interactions using paired samples ttests. The progression
criteria were (1) > 50% of eligible participants recruited, (2) > 50% of recruited participants retained, (3) > 50% of
active play sessions spent in MVPA, and (4) > 50% of participants complete outcome measurements.
Results: All progression criteria were met. Recruitment and retention rates were 100% ( n=21 participants).
Intervention adherence was high, based on data from n=1 school, with 90% of participants attending all sessions.
Measuring physical activity using accelerometry and fundamental movement skills using the Test of Gross Motor
Development-2 were feasible. The Playground Observation of Peer Engagement tool to measure social interactions
was not feasible. The only significant increase post-intervention was for social interactions during structured play
(pre –post mean difference: –1.46, 95% CI −1.99,−0.93). Staff feedback was positive with the intervention well
received by schools and potential benefits post-intervention identified by teachers.

Introduction
Physical activity refers to any bodily movement pro-
duced by the skeletal muscles that increases energy ex-
penditure above a resting level [ 1] and is associated with
numerous physical and mental health benefits in chil-
dren, e.g. reduced levels of obesity, anxiety, and depres-
sion [ 2–4]. It is recommended that children participate
in an average of 60 min moderate to vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) per day and minimise sedentary time
[5]. However, many children with intellectual disabilities,
which refers to limitations with intellectual functioning
(intelligent quotient: IQ < 70) and adaptive behaviours
[6], complete insufficient activity to gain clinically mean-
ingful health benefits and spend a large portion of their
day sedentary [ 7,8].
As childhood physical activity levels are predictive of
activity in adulthood, it is essential to develop methods
to increase childhood activity to promote long-term ac-
tivity and health [ 9]. However, no interventions have
been effective at increasing physical activity levels in
children with intellectual disabilities [ 10]. Previous inter-
ventions have generally focussed on exercise training ra-
ther than being tailored to overcome known barriers to
activity [ 10]. Children with intellectual disabilities can
face various barriers to physical activity, including not
having the physical skills required to be active, reduced
social skills, and a lack of accessible clubs and facilities
[11]. These intrapersonal and environmental barriers
limit the opportunities that children with intellectual
disabilities have for physical activity, which needs to be
addressed.
It is therefore important to develop new methods that
address structural barriers to activity that are not only
focussed on individual behaviour change. Interventions
should focus on long-term physical activity, address
known barriers to activity, and support children with in-
tellectual disabilities to develop the skills and motivation
required to be active throughout their lives [ 10]. One
evolving method warranting further investigation is
‘active play ’, which is ‘a form of gross motor or total
body movement in which young children exert energy in
a freely chosen, fun, and unstructured manner ’(p.164)
[12]. Active play is mostly conducted outdoors andtherefore is not restricted to one location, is suitable for
varying levels of abilities, and requires little or no equip-
ment [ 12]. Outdoor time is associated with increased
physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness and re-
duced sedentary time [ 13]. The evidence based on the
benefits of active play is still limited, but the emerging
findings suggest it has the potential to increase children ’s
MVPA levels and fundamental movement skills [ 14].
Therefore, as active play requires minimal infrastruc-
ture and is designed to develop the fundamental phys-
ical and social skills required to be active, this could
help children with intellectual disabilities to overcome
the barriers to activity that they commonly face.
Recently within the UK, the Go2Play Active Play inter-
vention has been implemented in mainstream primary
schools as part of a pragmatic evaluation and a feasibility
cluster randomised controlled trial [ 15,16]. This inter-
vention was shown to be feasible to implement in
schools, effective at getting children active at a
moderate-vigorous intensity, and provided preliminary
evidence of positive intervention effects, e.g. increased
MVPA and fundamental movement skills. However,
these studies did not include additional support needs
schools, and therefore, no data is available on the feasi-
bility of this intervention for children with intellectual
disabilities. As the ‘key ingredients ’of behaviour chance
within this intervention relate to children developing the
basic physical and social skills that are required to be ac-
tive, it is well suited to the needs of children with intel-
lectual disabilities.
The overall aim of this study is to investigate the feasi-
bility of the Go2Play Active Play intervention for chil-
dren with intellectual disabilities in additional support
needs schools. This will enable data to be gathered on
the feasibility key outcomes that will inform the develop-
ment of a larger trial. This study was designed based on
the Medical Research Council guidelines for developing
and evaluating complex interventions, specifically the
phase of testing trial feasibility/piloting [ 17]. Therefore,
this feasibility study aims to investigate (1) recruitment
and retention, (2) intervention adherence, (3) the feasi-
bility and acceptability of different outcome measures,
and (4) potential intervention effects.McGarty et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:43 Page 2 of 9
Methods
Ethical approval
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the
Medical, Veterinary, and Life Sciences College ethics
committee, University of Glasgow.
Design
A single-group design was employed. The intervention
was delivered in two additional support needs schools in
Greater Glasgow, Scotland, during one school term
(January to June, 2019). Baseline measurements were
conducted in the week prior to the intervention com-
mencing and post-intervention measurements were con-
ducted the week after the intervention ended. This trial
was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRC
TN10277566).
Recruitment and participants
A convenience sample was recruited from two additional
support needs schools. Two classes were selected from
each school to recruit from ( n= 22 children in total),
with the aim of recruiting all of these children. This
sample size was chosen as it is sufficient for the initial
feasibility aims to be assessed. Only recruiting from spe-
cific classes was a feasibility decision as it enabled the
Active Play sessions to be conducted at a class level. A
structured recruitment strategy was utilised, with eligible
children given an information pack with study details to
discuss with their parents. This was followed-up with a
parent information session at each school, at which par-
ents could ask questions and get more information on
the study. All aspects of recruitment were conducted by
one researcher who was not involved in any other as-
pects of data collection. Children were eligible to partici-
pate if they had intellectual disabilities, were aged 7 –12
years, and were independently ambulatory. Intellectual
disability was measured using the Child and Adolescent
Intellectual Disability Screening Scale (CAIDS-Q), which
enables a yes/no assessment on the likelihood of intellec-
tual disabilities based on age-specific criteria. Children
with additional support needs who did not have intellec-
tual disabilities were not eligible. All participants and
parents were required to provide informed consent.
Go2Play Active Play intervention
The Go2Play Active Play intervention was developed in
partnership between Agile CIC social enterprise ( www.
agilecic.com ) and Inspiring Scotland ( www.
inspiringscotland.org.uk ) to encourage children to play
physically active games in an outdoor environment. It is
underpinned by the concept of physical literacy and the
development of the fundamental movement skills,
motivation, and confidence required to be physically
active. In addition to skill development, this interventionprimarily aims to support behaviour change in children
through increased social support and environmental
change [ 18]. Prior to the intervention commencing, one
of the intervention development team observed physical
education classes at the participating schools to assess if
any adaptations were required to the intervention. Due
to the flexibility of the programme, no adaptations to
content of the active play sessions were deemed neces-
sary. However, due to developmental differences
between children with and without intellectual disabil-
ities, it was deemed appropriate to recruit an older sam-
ple of children (7 –12 years) in comparison to the
previous studies in mainstream schools, which recruited
7-year-old children [ 15,16]. Furthermore, in mainstream
schools the intervention was delivered for 10 weeks with
two sessions per week. However, due to the demands of
the curriculum in the participating schools it was not
possible to deliver sessions within this timeframe. In-
stead, the intervention was delivered once per week over
a longer duration. Otherwise, the intervention remained
the same as the version delivered in the mainstream
schools [ 15,16].
The intervention ran for 17 weeks (excluding school
holidays) and consisted of a weekly 60-min active play
session. Sessions were facilitated by the same local play
charities who delivered the Go2Play Active Play inter-
vention in mainstream schools. Training about children
with intellectual disabilities was given to the play
workers who were delivering the intervention, e.g. how
to communicate instructions. The sessions were
designed to develop fundamental movement skills and
increase activity levels, but also to be fun and inclusive
to foster positive experiences and perceptions of physical
activity. Sessions consisted of a 30-min structured play,
with sessions focussed on developing different funda-
mental movement skills, e.g. throwing and catching
games to develop object control. The second half of the
session was free play where children were encouraged to
interact and to create and play their own games, with
the aim of developing social skills.
Demographic and developmental variables
Anthropometric measurements were taken at baseline
and post-intervention, in accordance with the Inter-
national Standards for Anthropometric Assessment [ 19].
Weight and height were measured using digital scales
and a stadiometer, respectively, and body mass index
calculated [BMI: weight/height2(kg/m2)]. Parents of par-
ticipants also reported their child ’s age and gender via
questionnaire. The British Picture Vocabulary Scale
(BPVS) [ 20] was used to assess the language skills of par-
ticipants. Teachers completed the seven-item CAIDS-Q,
which strongly correlates with IQ and adaptive behav-
iour scores, and accurately determines whether childrenMcGarty et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:43 Page 3 of 9
have intellectual disabilities [ 21]. The CAIDS-Q was
used to ensure that all participants had an intellectual
disability.
Feasibility and acceptability (primary outcomes)
Recruitment and retention
Recruitment rates were calculated as a percentage based
on the number of children recruited vs. the number of
children in the four participating classes ( n= 22). Data
relating to recruitment was collected by a member of
the research team not directly involved in delivering the
intervention or conducting any pre-post measurements.
Dropout was defined as any child (at their own or at
their parent ’s request) who chose to no longer partici-
pate in the active play sessions and/or did not to partici-
pate in any of the baseline or post-intervention
measurements; teachers and play workers were asked to
inform the research team if any participants dropped out
of the study. These outcomes are consistent with those
used when this intervention was delivered in mainstream
school, which enables direct comparison.
Intervention adherence
Adherence was operationalised as attendance at the
active play sessions, with all non-attendance recorded as
non-adherence, and session MVPA levels. Teachers were
asked to record participant attendance at the active play
sessions and reasons for non-attendance. The sessions
were designed with the aim of children completing at
least 30 min (50% of each session) in MVPA. Partici-
pants wore an ActiGraph wGT3X+ accelerometer dur-
ing four sessions to assess whether at least 50% of the
session in was spent doing MVPA. The ActiGraph
wGT3X+ is a small, lightweight device that been vali-
dated for children with intellectual disabilities and was
worn around the waist, attached using an elastic belt
[22]. Physical activity was recorded using 5-s epochs,
and due to the active nature of the sessions, 5 min of
continuous zero counts was used to identify non-wear.
MVPA was classified using population-specific cut
points [ 22].
School-based physical activity and sedentary behaviour
School-based physical activity and sedentary behaviour
were measured using the ActiGraph wGT3X+ acceler-
ometer. Participants wore the accelerometer during
school hours for five consecutive days at baseline and
post-intervention. We also asked teachers to complete
an accelerometer wear diary to record when the devices
were put on and taken off for each participant, and to
report reasons for the device being removed during the
day. The required wear time for the device was four out
of the five measurement days for at least 3 h per day
(which represents approximately 50% of the school day),and non-wear was classified as 20 min of continues zero
counts [ 23,24]. We recorded how many participants
met this criteria to assess the feasibility and acceptability
of this measure. Sedentary behaviour and physical activ-
ity levels were estimated from the raw count data using
population-specific cut points [ 22].
Fundamental movement skills
Fundamental movement skills were assessed at baseline
and post-intervention using the Test of Gross Motor
Development-2 (TGMD-2), which is valid and reliable
for children with intellectual disabilities [ 25]. This test
measured locomotor skills (e.g. running and jumping)
and object control (e.g. kick and throw), the results of
which give an overall gross motor quotient. The percent-
age of participants completing this test, as well as rea-
sons for non-compliance, was recorded to assess
feasibility. Participants removed their accelerometers
during these measurements.
Social interactions
Social interactions were measured during the first and
last intervention sessions using the Playground Observa-
tion of Peer Engagement (POPE) tool [ 26]. This time-
interval behavioural coding tool is designed to assess the
social interactions of children with additional support
needs during play. This was conducted using direct ob-
servation, with the sessions video-recorded and analysed
post hoc by one researcher. Behaviours were coded by
observing for 40 s and coding behaviours for 20 s for
each minute of the session. The RESAM component of
this scale was used to give an overall score based on five
types of social behaviours during play: (1) initiated inter-
action with another child, (2) responded to another
child, (3) engaged in a conversation ( ≥4 exchanges with
another child), (4) engaged in a game with another
child/group of children, and (5) observed a game of
another child/group of children. Participants were
scored when they demonstrated one of these behaviours
and the final rating ranged from 0 (demonstrated none
of these behaviours) to 5 (demonstrated all these behav-
iours). Feasibility was assessed on whether this direct
observation methodology and use of the POPE tool
enabled all relevant social interactions to be recorded.
Staff feedback
A questionnaire was developed to collect qualitative data
from teachers ( n= 3), whose students were involved in
the intervention, and the lead facilitator of the interven-
tion ( n= 1). The questionnaire contained seven open-
ended questions relating to perceptions of feasibility,
benefits/limitations, and effectiveness of delivery. Ques-
tionnaires were completed in paper ( n= 3) or electronic
(n=1) format.McGarty et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:43 Page 4 of 9
Potential intervention effects (secondary outcomes)
Potential intervention effects were examined using
baseline and post-intervention data for MVPA, seden-
tary behaviour, social interactions, and fundamental
movement skills.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative primary outcome and demographic vari-
ables were analysed descriptively, with recruitment,
retention, and session adherence rates calculated as per-
centages. Qualitative data were analysed by one
researcher using thematic analysis in accordance with
Braun and Clarke ’s six-phase approach [ 27]. Although
this study was not powered to detect change, potential
pre-post changes were investigated for school-based
MVPA and sedentary behaviour, fundamental movement
skills, and social interactions using a per protocol ana-
lysis with paired samples ttests. All statistical data were
analysed using SPSS 21 statistical package (SPSS IBM,
New York, NY, USA), and results are presented as mean
(M) and standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated.
Statistical significance was set at p<.05. The criteria to
assess whether this study should progress to a larger trial
were (1) > 50% of eligible participants recruited, (2) >
50% of recruited participants retained throughout the
trial, (3) > 50% of active play sessions spent in MVPA,
and (4) > 50% of participants complete outcome
measurements.
Results
Participant summary/demographics
Twenty-two participants took part in this study. How-
ever, one participant ’s CAIDS-Q score was not in the
intellectual disabilities range and their data were
excluded from the analyses, resulting in a final sample of
n=21. Participants were aged from 7 to 12 years, and
most were male and ranged from underweight to obese.
The participants ’demographic data are presented in
Table 1.
Primary outcomes: feasibility and acceptability of
measures
Recruitment and retention
Across the two schools, we had a 100% recruitment rate.
All children ( n=21) who were eligible to take part pro-
vided the required child and parent consent, demon-
strating that the recruitment strategy was feasible and
effective. In relation to acceptability, we had a 100%
retention rate with no participants withdrawing. Results
are summarised in Table 2.
Intervention adherence
Only one school provided data relating to intervention
adherence, which reported 90% of participants attendedall sessions for the full duration. Reasons for non-
attendance were mostly due to participants being absent
from school but behavioural reasons were also reported.
Based on accelerometer data collected during the four
sessions, participants spent M= 57.11 % (SD = 20.78%)
of the sessions in MVPA. Although sessions were
intended to be 60 min, the average session duration ob-
served over the four sample sessions was M= 40.60 min
(range: 39.00 –41.12 min) due to the time required to get
participants ready and to manage any challenging cir-
cumstances. The split between structured and free play
was consistent with the intended 50/50 split, with the
average split across the four sample sessions being M=
21.50 min structured play and M= 18.5 min free play.
Feasibility of outcome measures
For school-based physical activity and sedentary behav-
iour, n=12 (57.14%) met the accelerometer wear criteria
(4 out of 5 days for ≥3 h per day) at baseline and n=13
(61.90%) met the criteria at post-intervention. However,
8 accelerometers malfunctioned at baseline due to an
error that occurred during group initialisation and noTable 1 Demographic data of participants

data was collected. Therefore, assessing wear time for
these participants, who all attended the same school,
was based on data collected from the wear diaries. Rea-
sons for non-compliance with the wear criteria were pri-
marily due to absences from school, with n=2
participants refusing to wear the accelerometer at base-
line and post-intervention.
For fundamental movement skills, n=20 (95.24%)
participants completed the measurements at baseline,
with one participant refusing. Post-intervention, n=19
(90.48%) participants completed the measurements, with
two participants absent. In relation to feasibility, minor
issues were encountered with finding an available space
within the schools that was a suitable sized and quiet
enough to conduct the tests. In addition, for some parts
of the tests, participants were assisted by teachers, e.g.
hand holding.
For the social interactions measurements, baseline and
post-intervention data were collected for n=17 (80.95%)
andn=12 (57.14%) participants, respectively, with all
missing data due to absences from school. However,
during the analysis issues were identified with the feasi-
bility of the POPE tool as it is designed to only measure
children ’s social behaviour, independent of adult assist-
ance. During the sessions, however, it was observed that
adult presence and assistance (e.g. play workers and
teachers) was unavoidable due to the design of the inter-
vention and the additional support needs of the children.
Therefore, the analysis included social interactions that
also involved adults, which limits the validity and applic-
ability of this tool.
Staff feedback
Themes identified from the questionnaires were practi-
calities and scheduling, engagement with the interven-
tion, and behaviour changes over the intervention
duration. In summary, feedback was highly positive from
teachers and the play worker who all noted high levels
of enjoyment and engagement from participants during
the sessions. Teachers reported positive benefits for par-
ticipants as the intervention progressed, such as in-
creased class-time concentration, willingness to
participate, and improved physical and social skills. The
play worker also reported that the original intervention
design that was implemented in mainstream schools was
feasible and did not require significant changes. The
challenges discussed included finding time to schedule
the sessions towards the end of term and the practical
difficulties of conducting baseline and post-interventions
in the weeks close to major school holidays, as the num-
ber of extra-curricular activities increased during these
times. It was also noted that occasionally some partici-
pants could not participate in all activities without extra
staff attention.Secondary outcomes: potential intervention effects
School-based physical activity and sedentary behaviour
Accelerometer data from the 5-day pre- and post-
intervention weeks showed similar time spent in MVPA
and sedentary behaviour. MVPA (percentage of wear
time) was M= 16.87% (SD = 11.84) at baseline and M=
15.45 % (SD = 8.03) post-intervention, which shows no
indication of change (pre –post mean difference: 1.42,
95% CI −3.62, 6.47). Sedentary behaviour (percentage of
wear time) was M= 71.05 % (SD = 13.83) at baseline
andM= 73.00 % (SD = 11.72) post-intervention, which
also shows no indication of change (pre –post mean dif-
ference: –1.95, 95% CI −7.29, 3.39).
Fundamental movement skills
Gross motor quotient scores were M=59.50 (SD =
12.46) at baseline and M= 62.60 (SD = 14.11) post-
intervention, which shows no indication of change (pre –
post mean difference: –3.40, 95% CI −7.46, 0.66).
Social interactions
For the structured part of the sessions, out of a possible
score of 5, scores were M= 2.77 (SD = 1.26) at baseline
andM= 4.23 (SD = 1.42) post-intervention, which rep-
resents a significant increase in social interactions (pre –
post mean difference: –1.46, 95% CI −1.99, −0.93).
During the free-play component of the sessions, there
was an increase in scores from baseline ( M= 3.45, SD =
1.51) to post-intervention ( M= 4.00, SD = 1.27), but this
was not significant (pre –post mean difference: –0.55,
95% CI −1.93, 0.84).
Discussion
This study is the first to examine the feasibility of deliv-
ering a school-based active play intervention to children
with intellectual disabilities. The results of this study
suggest that the Go2Play Active Play intervention is feas-
ible for children with intellectual disabilities.
We had excellent recruitment and retention rates
(100%) for the study. This is equal or higher than the
rates reported when this intervention was implemented
in mainstream schools, which reported recruitment and
retention rates of 66% and 100% [ 15,16]. However, it is
important to note that the participating schools had
existing relationships with the research team, which may
have increased school/teacher engagement. Nonetheless,
this is a positive finding and highlights that it is feasible
to recruit and retain children with intellectual disabilities
to an active play intervention. The difficulties with
recruiting children with intellectual disabilities to
research are well reported [ 28]. Therefore, this demon-
strates that the recruitment strategy is effective.
Adherence with the intervention was also high, with
90% of participants attending all sessions. None of theMcGarty et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:43 Page 6 of 9
reasons for non-attendance were related to the study
and were due to school absences or behavioural issues.
In the context of additional needs schools, it is common
for children to be absent for part of the school day to
attend appointments, e.g. hospital appointments or ther-
apy session, and for children to occasionally display be-
havioural problems [ 29]. Therefore, it may be difficult to
overcome these issues in future studies. Only one school
reported adherence rates, however, due to teacher work-
load and as such this rate may not be fully representative
and therefore should be interpreted with caution. To
address this, in future phas es of this work, adherence
rates should be recorded by members of the research
team or play workers, rather than teachers. Another
important point to note is that the age of participants
in this study ranged from 7 –12 years. As demonstrated
by the high levels of adherence and recruitment, this
highlights that the flexibility of the intervention enables
it to be suitable for a wide range of participants, which
is a promising finding in relation to scaling up this
intervention.
Participants also spent a large portion of the sessions
active, demonstrating the effectiveness of the interven-
tion to get participants active at a moderate to vigorous
intensity. Therefore, the intervention design does not
need to be changed for future phases. This demonstrates
that this intervention could contribute to children with
intellectual disabilities achieving the physical activity
guidelines and address the low levels of school-based
physical activity and, specifically, low levels of MVPA
[30,31]. However, this study did highlight that although
the sessions were designed to last 60 min, the mean ses-
sion time was 40.60 min, which was a consistent session
duration across the two schools (range: 39.00 –41.12
min). This was due to the time taken to get participants
from classes and changed before and after the session.
This is not an issue specific to additional support needs
schools as this was also reported when the Go2Play Ac-
tive Play intervention was implemented in mainstream
schools [ 16]. However, to ensure consistency of delivery
in future phases of this work, it is important to account
for this and work with schools to try and ensure the ses-
sion duration is 60 min.
Based on teacher feedback, future phases of this work
should also consider when baseline and post-intervention
measurements are conducted. The baseline measurements
were conducted the first school week after the Christmas
break and the post-intervention measurements were con-
ducted during the final week before the summer holidays.
Due to these measurements being close to major school
holidays, there were numerous children who missed parts
of these measurements, in particular the post-intervention
measurements, which could impact the statistical power
of a future study. Therefore, when to conduct baselineand post-intervention measurements should be discussed
with the schools to reduce this effect.
In relation to the outcome measures, it is a promis-
ing finding that all measures were feasible, with the
exception of the POPE observation tool. Although it
is important to note that direct observation was feas-
ible, even though the recording categories of the
POPE tool proved to be unsuitable. Compliance with
wearing the accelerometer was high when children
were in school. However, the high level of absences
during the measurement weeks prevented some
participants from achieving the wear criteria. If the
data collection weeks can be arranged in consultation

compliance. If not, the wear criteria may have to be
reduced to accommodate the unique environment of
additional support needs schools. Finally, the role that
adult support had on measurements and how this
impacted the validity of test results needs to be con-
sidered. This was particularly apparent for the
TGMD-2, and therefore, future studies should limit
teacher involvement during the TGMD-2 by including
additional researchers to support the administration
of this test.
Teacher and play worker feedback provided valuable
data on how the intervention was received within the
school and by the participating children. It was
highlighted that the start and end of the school term are
busy and therefore not the most effective times to con-
duct baseline and post-intervention measurements.
These views were consistent with the participant data.
Another interesting outcome from this qualitative elem-
ent was the benefits reported by teachers as the inter-
vention progressed, such as improved social skills during
class time. This is an interesting finding and supports
the pre-post analysis which found significant increases
in social interactions post-intervention. Therefore, it is
important to investigate these outcomes in future phases
of this work with a sample size that is sufficiently pow-
ered to detect change. One of the challenges reported by
the play workers was that some children could not par-
ticipate in all aspects of the session without adult sup-
port. This was to be expected due to the wide-ranging
intellectual disabilities of participants, which was why
adult support was encouraged, where necessary, during
the sessions. As the original Go2Play Active Play inter-
vention was designed for children aged approximately 7
years, this also suggests that this intervention is better
suited to older children with intellectual disabilities due
to differences between their chronological and develop-
mental age. However, the suitability of this intervention
to children with intellectual disabilities of different ages
requires further examination. In addition, it is also im-
portant to conduct a more in-depth process evaluationMcGarty et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:43 Page 7 of 9
to better capture data on the implementation of this
intervention.
Future research needs
In line with the Medical Research Council guidelines for
developing and evaluating complex interventions [ 17],
future research should focus on piloting the Go2Play
Active Play intervention in a larger and representative
sample of children with intellectual disabilities, with a
wider range of ages included. A pilot cluster randomised
controlled trial with a wait-list control group would
enable preliminary assessment of effectiveness, e.g.
increasing physical activity levels, fundamental move-
ment skills, and social skills, estimating sample size for a
full trial, and test the feasibility of randomising schools.
Strengths and limitations
This study addresses a significant gap in the literature
and proposes a novel approach for increasing physical
activity in children with intellectual disabilities. A thor-
ough investigation of feasibility and acceptability was
conducted using both quantitative and qualitative
methods, which has enabled in-depth data to be col-
lected that can inform future phases of this work. Limi-
tations are that the participating schools were selected
based on existing relationships with the research team,
which may have increased buy-in and engagement from
the head teacher and teaching staff. In addition, partici-
pants were recruited from selected classes, and therefore,
the findings from this sample may not be fully represen-
tative of all children attending the schools; this is further
highlighted by 76.2% of the sample being male.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that it is
feasible to implement the Go2Play Active Play interven-
tion in schools for children with additional support
needs. The design and measures are feasible and accept-
able, although some aspects of data collected may need
to be modified for a future trial. The intervention re-
ceived positive feedback from staff, and potentially posi-
tive changes were identified from both the qualitative
and quantitate elements of this study. For the next phase
of this study, it is essential to test the effectiveness of
this intervention in a greater number of schools, with
sufficient statistical power to detect pre-post changes,
and to conduct a more in-depth process evaluation to
further investigate implementation, e.g. and feasibility on
a larger scale.
