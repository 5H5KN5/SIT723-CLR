How Useful are the Stages of Change for Targeting Interventions?  
Randomized Test of a Brief Intervention to Reduce Smoking  
Abstract 
Objectives .  To see whether the stages of change are useful for targeting a brief interve ntion to 
reduce smoking based on implementation intentions.  A second objective was to rule out demand 
characteristics as an alternative explanation for the findings of intervention  studies based on the 
transtheoretical model and implementation intentions.  Design . Participants ( N = 350) were 
randomized to a passive control condition (questionnaire only), active control condition 
(questionnaire-plus-instruction to plan to quit) or experimental condition (questionnaire , plan to 
quit, form an implementation intention).  Their behavior and psychosocial orientation to quit 
were measured at baseline and 2-month follow-up. Main Outcome Measures .  Theory of planned 
behavior variables, nicotine dependence and quitting. Results . Significantly more people quit 
smoking in the experimental condition than in the control conditions, and the planning 
instructions changed intention to quit and perceived control over quitting, but not behavior.  
Stage of change moderated these effects such that implementation intentions worke d best for 
individuals who were in the preparation stage at baseline. Conclusion . Harnessing both 
motivational and volitional processes seems to enhance the effectiveness of smoking cessation 
programs, although further work is required to clarify inconsistencies in the litera ture using the 
stages of change.

How Useful are the Stages of Change for Targeting Interventions?  
Randomized Test of a Brief Intervention to Reduce Smoking  
 Smoking is regarded as the most important source of preventable morbidity and 
mortality.  In the United Kingdom alone, it is estimated that 106,000 people died from smoking-
related causes in each year between 1998 and 2002 (Twigg, Moon, & Walker, 2004).  The 
serious consequences associated with smoking has led to concerted efforts to encourage  people 
to quit, and the prevalence of smoking declined from 45% in 1974 to 26% in 2003 (UK National 
Statistics, 2006).  However, despite this significant decrease in the prevalence  of smoking, the 
rate of decline since the early 1990’s is generally regarded as being too slow to meet  the 
prevalence target set in the UK Department of Health’s Public Service Agre ement, to have 21% 
or fewer adult smokers by 2010 (UK Department of Health, 2004).  The implication is that  
further research into the factors that might enhance smoking cessation programs in the  
population at large is required.  An important means of achieving this goal is through effici ent 
targeting of broad cross-sections of the population with theory-based interventions.  
 The transtheoretical model (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983) has been used extensi vely to 
try and encourage smoking cessation and is arguably the dominant psychological model in this 
field.  The transtheoretical model consists of at least 14 individua l components, including the 
stages of change (precontemplation, contemplation, prepara tion, action and maintenance), 
decisional balance, self-efficacy/temptation, and ten processes of change.  A s a tool for 
promoting smoking cessation, the transtheoretical model has typically been used to develop 
individually tailored communications (see Velicer, Prochaska, & Redding, 2006).  On the basi s 
of participants’ responses to questionnaires, up to 20,000 unique reports tailored by each part of 
the transtheoretical model can be delivered and have thus far produced smoking abstinence  rates 
of 22-26% (Velicer et al., 2006).  However, transtheoretical model-based tailore d 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 4 
communications have only been tested against relatively passive control conditions ( e.g., no 
treatment, self-help manual), which is potentially problematic because it is : (a) unclear which 
parts of the interventions are causing the significant effects; and (b) plausi ble that receiving 
additional materials or increasing the attention paid to participants could partia lly account for the 
positive findings.  There are also several practical constraints associat ed with the transtheoretical 
model-based tailored communications; for example, participants must be screen ed prior to 
receiving the interventions and the materials comprise 3-4 page booklets (Velic er et al., 2006), 
which require commitment on behalf of the participant to read and engage in them.  
One theory-based health behavior change technique that circumvents these practi cal 
difficulties is Gollwitzer’s (1999) concept of implementation intention that was  developed in the 
experimental social psychology literature and has been shown to be effective in changi ng health 
behavior (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).  Work in the laboratory shows that implementati on 
intentions work by making critical situations for action salient and by automatizing a li nked 
behavioral response (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).  In contrast with techniques found in 
cognitive behavioral therapy such as goal-setting (which generally focus on helping a client  
achieve a goal using self-reward), implementation intentions are often self-di rected and are 
focused on identifying responses that will lead to goal attainment and on anticipating suitabl e 
occasions to act.  Thus, participants are asked to specify cues in the environment that  will guide 
their future behavior (e.g., being tempted to smoke), and link them with behaviors they will enac t 
when they encounter those cues (e.g., engaging in physical activity).  The idea is that speci fying 
where and when one will act ensures that the behavior will be triggered at the appropr iate time in 
the future without affecting people’s motivation (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).  Across  94 
independent studies in both laboratory and field settings, Gollwitzer and Sheeran’s (2006) me ta-
analysis showed that implementation intention had an average effect size of d = .65.  Although 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 5 
none of the 94 studies reviewed by Gollwitzer and Sheeran (2006) investigated smoking 
cessation, recent studies suggest that implementation intentions are effecti ve in encouraging 
quitting.  For example, Armitage (2007) showed that an implementation intention intervention 
caused 11.63% (5/43) of smokers to quit as opposed to 2% (1/47) who quit in the control group 
(p < .05, see also Armitage, in press).  
However, implementation intention intervention studies are not without their limitat ions.  
First, consistent with the transtheoretical model-based tailoring studies, mos t implementation 
intention interventions have been tested against a passive control condition: Participa nts in the 
experimental group are typically asked to change their behavior and to form an implement ation 
intention whereas participants in the control group are typically asked to do neither (e .g., 
Armitage, 2007; for exceptions see Armitage, in press; Murgraff, White, & Phill ips, 1996).  This 
is important because the use of passive control groups may have exaggerated the effecti veness of 
implementation intention-based interventions and it would be valuable to tease apa rt the effects 
of asking participants to change their behavior from forming an implementation intenti on. 
Second, a debate has arisen surrounding two studies by Jackson and colleagues (Jackson 
et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2006), which failed to replicate the effects of impl ementation 
intentions in relation to fruit and vegetable consumption and adherence to antibiotics in cl inical 
populations.  In explaining their findings, Jackson et al. (2005, 2006) argue that students may be 
particularly susceptible to implementation intention interventions because they ar e more 
compliant with task demands.  Consistent with Jackson et al.’s (2005, 2006) interpretation of 
their data, Gollwitzer and Sheeran (2006) showed that the effects of implementat ion intentions 
were greater in student samples d = .65 ( N = 6,855) than in the general public ( d = .58, N = 
1,076).  The implication is that further research into implementation intention-based 
interventions needs to be conducted on general population – as opposed to student – samples.  
Stages of change and targeting interventions 6 
Third, there is evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of implementation inte ntion 
interventions might be enhanced if they were targeted.  Of particular relevance to t he present 
research, a study by Armitage (2006) tested whether social cognitive variables  and an 
implementation intention intervention could explain movements between Prochaska and 
DiClemente’s (1983) stages of change in relation to eating a low-fat diet.  Consiste nt with 
Gollwitzer’s (1999) theory of action phases, Armitage’s (2006) findings showed that 
proportionately more people progressed from the preparation (preparing oneself and one’ s social 
world for a change in behavior) stage than the precontemplation (unaware or under-awar e of the 
risks associated a health behavior) or contemplation (considering changing one’s beha vior in the 
next month) stages.  The implication is that targeting implementation intentions at s mokers in the 
preparation stage might enhance the effects of the implementation intention inte rventions.  
However, the results of a recent cross-sectional survey have questioned the  validity of the 
staging algorithm for smoking.  Herzog and Blagg (2007) tested the stage of change algori thm 
against several measures of motivation to quit and concluded that the stage of change  algorithm 
underestimated motivation to quit smoking.  Although Herzog and Blagg’s (2007) study raises 
important questions about the validity of the stage of change measure, it is worth noting a 
number of potentially important differences between Herzog and Blagg’s (2007) study a nd the 
present research.  
First, common among most of the supporting studies they cite, Herzog and Blagg (2007) 
tested the stage of change algorithm against single item measures of motivat ion (see also Etter & 
Sutton, 2002; Kraft, Sutton, & Reynolds, 1999; Sciamanna, Hoch, Duke, Fogle, & Ford, 2000), 
raising questions about the reliability of the motivational measures used to question the va lidity 
of the staging algorithm.  Second, it is plausible that Herzog and Blagg’s (2007) participant s may 
have been more motivated than smokers in the population at large because they recruited 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 7 
smokers through “newspaper advertisements and flyers distributed at community event s” (p. 
224) and paid participants $25 for completing the questionnaire as opposed to proactively 
recruiting participants from the community (cf. Velicer et al., 2006).  In fact, seve ral studies cited 
by Herzog and Blagg (2007) include smokers who may have been more motivated to quit than 
the average: Etter and Sutton (2002) collected their data over the internet using a sa mple that 
consisted mainly of people who had previously taken part in an online smoking cessation 
program; Quinlan and McCaul (2000) used students who were paid $15 or received course credit  
and were entered in a lottery; and Sciamanna et al. (2000) examined hospitalized smoker s.  The 
present study adopts a more proactive approach to recruitment and uses standard reliabl e 
measures (derived from Ajzen’s, 1991, theory of planned behavior) to assess motivat ion.  
Herzog and Blagg’s (2007) study also seems to challenge work showing strong linear 
relationships between motivation and the stages of change (e.g., Armitage, 2006; Arm itage & 
Arden, 2007).  From a conceptual point of view, linear differences in motivation across the  
stages of change are problematic, as they imply a “pseudo-stage model” (e.g., Sutton, 2000).  
However, from a practical perspective, measures of motivation do not lend themselve s to aid in 
the targeting of interventions because they are continuous and therefore not readil y amenable to 
audience segmentation.  In contrast, the staging algorithm provides clear cut-off points  and a 
potentially powerful way of targeting relatively discrete groups.  Given that the sta ges of change 
are linearly related to a variety of social cognitive variables from several  theoretical perspectives 
(e.g., Armitage, 2006; Armitage & Arden, 2007), it seems preferable to target interventi ons on 
the basis of the stages of change as opposed to the demographic variables (e.g., income, age , 
gender) favored by social marketers (e.g., Knott, Muers, & Aldridge, 2007).  
Rationale and Study Aims 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 8 
The research reviewed above provides the following rationale for the present study.  
First, there is a need to develop effective behavior change interventions that can be adm inistered 
efficiently to smokers in the general population.  Second, both transtheoretical model-ba sed and 
implementation intention-based interventions have employed passive control groups, which m ay 
have exaggerated their effectiveness.  Third, several studies seem to question t he validity of the 
stages of change algorithm, but these conclusions have been drawn on the basis of comparisons 
with potentially unreliable measures of motivation and in samples of smokers who might 
reasonably be expected to be highly motivated to quit.  Fourth, there is some evidence to suggest 
that the effects of implementation intentions may be most pronounced when they are targe ted at 
people preparing to change their behavior – and it would be valuable to verify this claim.  
On this basis, it was therefore hypothesized that: (a) implementation intentions w ould 
significantly reduce smoking over and above the effects of both active and passive control  
conditions; (b) consistent with the idea that implementation intentions are volitiona l strategies, 
the effects of the intervention would be independent of motivational variables derived fr om the 
theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991); (c) the stage of change algorithm would show a linea r 
relationship with reliable measures of motivation in a sample recruited proact ively; and (d) the 
stages of change, derived from Prochaska and DiClemente’s (1983) transtheoretic al model would 
moderate the effects of the implementation intention intervention such that more  quitting would 
occur in participants who formed implementation intentions while being in the preparat ion stage.  
Method  
Participants and Procedure   
Workers employed by a company ( N = 1,600) in the south of England were screened to 
see if they currently smoked cigarettes.  Four hundred and thirteen smokers were ident ified and 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 9 
invited (with no incentive) to complete a “Cigarette Smoking Questionnaire”.  Three hundr ed 
and fifty consented to participate (Figure 1).  
The sample consisted of 177 women and 173 men aged 36 years on average ( M = 36.20, 
SD  = 14.30) who were from a range of academic backgrounds and occupations.  Fourteen 
percent ( n = 49) had no formal qualifications and 50.8% ( n = 178) participants finished full time 
education by the age of 18 or younger.  The majority of the sample (70.3%) smoked 11 or more 
cigarettes per day.   
In order to assess the potential generalizability of the findings, the study population was  
compared with the UK population as a whole (Source: UK National statistics w ebsite: 
www.statistics.gov.uk ).  Consistent with the sampling frame, the employed (100% versus 74.9% 
in the UK) and people of typical working age (99% aged 16-74 years versus 72.3% in the UK) 
were overrepresented.  However, the proportion of people holding degrees was roughly 
equivalent (19.0% versus 16.3% in the UK), as was the proportion of women in the sample 
(50.6% versus 51.3% women in the UK).  Crucially, the number of smokers in the worksite 
(25.8% versus 26.0%), and the number of cigarettes smoked (70.3% smoking 11 or more per 
day) were directly comparable with figures for the UK population as a whole (72.2% smoking 10 
or more per day – note that the Fagerstrom tolerance questionnaire specifies 11 ci garettes per day 
as a cut-off whereas the UK government uses 10 cigarettes per day as its cut- off).  
Following screening to ensure the sample consisted solely of smokers, a 3-by-2 
randomized controlled design was implemented.  The independent variables were conditi on 
(experimental versus active control versus passive control) and time (baseline  versus follow-up).  
The manipulations were presented on the last page of a questionnaire designed to meas ure 
behavior and beliefs associated with cigarette smoking, meaning that once the questi onnaires had 
been sorted into random order (on the basis of a web-based randomizer) the individual who 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 10 
distributed the questionnaires to participants was blind to the conditions.  Anonymity was  
ensured through the generation of a personal code.  Participants were informed they could 
withdraw from the study at any time without question.  
All three groups received identical-looking questionnaires (the passive control group 
received the questionnaire alone).  In addition to the questionnaire, participants random ly 
assigned to the active control condition were asked to plan to quit smoking in the next two 
months: “We want you to plan to quit smoking during the next 2 months.  You are free to choose 
how  you will do this, but we want you to formulate your plans in as much detail as possible”.  
Participants randomized to the experimental condition were given the same instruc tions with an 
additional sentence that asked them to: “Please pay particular attention to the s ituations in which 
you will implement these plans”.  Thus, participants in the experimental group receive d standard 
implementation intention instructions (cf. Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) that speci fically asked 
participants to link their plans with critical situations.  
Participants’ subsequent cognition and behavior were measured at follow-up, two months 
post-baseline.  At follow-up, all participants were given identical confidential  questionnaires 
(minus the implementation intention intervention where appropriate), which were mat ched on the 
basis of the self-generated personal code.  Two hundred and eighty-three (80.9%) part icipants 
completed both the baseline and follow-up measures and provided sufficient information to 
match their responses on the basis of their self-generated personal code (Fig ure 1).  The data 
were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, meaning that those lost to follow-up were  treated as 
“no-changers”. 
Measures  
Stage of change.   Stage of change for smoking was assessed using an abridged version of 
DiClemente, Prochaska, Fairhurst, Velicer, Rossi, and Velasquez’s (1991) a lgorithm because 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 11 
nonsmokers (including people in action and maintenance) were screened out prior to the study 
commencing.  Thus, participants were first asked how many times they had quit smoking for at  
least 24 hours (to which they responded in open format) and second whether they were seriously 
thinking of quitting smoking.  The latter item provided participants with a checklist of thr ee 
options.  Participants were categorized as being in the preparation stage if the y were seriously 
thinking of quitting smoking within the next 30 days and if they had made at least one 24-hour 
quit attempt in the past year.  Participants who were seriously thinking of quitting smoki ng 
within the next 30 days but had not made at least one 24-hour quit attempt in the past year were 
deemed contemplators.  Participants were also regarded as being in the contempla tion stage if 
they were seriously thinking of quitting smoking within the next 6 months.  If participants 
indicated that they were not thinking of quitting, they were allocated to the precontemplati on 
stage.   
Motivation .  Variables derived from Ajzen’s (1991) theory of planned behavior - chosen 
because it is a model of human motivation that has been shown to be predictive of health 
behavior in general and smoking cessation in particular (e.g., Armitage, 2007) - were use d to 
measure motivation.  Each variable was measured by averaging responses to three standa rd items 
on 7-point scales.  The perceived control scale included the item: “My quitting smoking in the 
next 2 months is/would be… difficult -easy ”, Cronbach’s α at baseline was .89 and .92 at follow-
up.  The behavioral intention scale (e.g., “I intend to quit smoking in the next 2 months definitely 
do not -definitely do ”) also possessed good internal reliability at baseline ( α = .94) and follow-up 
(α = .95), as did the attitude scale (e.g., “My quitting smoking in the next 2 months is/would 
be… bad -good ”, Cronbach’s αs = .94 and .95 at baseline and follow-up, respectively), and the 
subjective norm scale (e.g., “People who are important to me want me to quit smoking in the  
next 2 months very unlikely -very likely ”, Cronbach’s αs = .73 at baseline and .78 at follow-up. 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 12 
Behavior.   Smoking status was assessed on the basis of whether people reported quitting 
(at follow-up only), and using a biologically-validated measure of nicotine dependence.  Ba sed 
on the Fagerstrom tolerance questionnaire (see Fagerstrom & Schneider, 1989, for a revi ew), the 
revised tolerance questionnaire is a 10-item measure of nicotine dependence that  has been 
validated against expired alveolar carbon monoxide (see Tate & Schmitz, 1993).  It inc ludes 
items such as, “How many cigarettes a day do you smoke?” and “How often do you smoke when 
you are sick with a cold, the flu, or are so ill that you are in bed for most of the day?”, all  of 
which are measured on 5-point Likert scales anchored with 10 or less  to 26 or more  and never  to 
always , respectively.  Cronbach’s α indicated that the revised tolerance questionnaire possessed 
good internal reliability at both baseline ( α = .78) and follow-up ( α = .81).  
These measures were chosen because of their demonstrable reliability an d validity, and 
because biological validation techniques (e.g., continine assessments) are not appropr iate for 
trials with fewer than 15,000 participants (Department of Health and Human Servi ces, 1990; 
Velicer, Prochaska, Rossi, & Snow, 1992).   
Results 
Randomization Check 
The success of the randomization procedure was checked using MANOVA.  The 
independent variable was condition  with three levels (experimental group versus the two control 
groups), and the dependent variables were age, gender, nicotine dependence, age of first 
cigarette, theory of planned behavior variables, and stage of change.  Unfortunatel y, the 
multivariate test was significant, F(18, 678) = 2.19, p < .01, ηp2 = .05.  Decomposition of this 
effect showed that participants in the active control condition were more likel y to be in the 
precontemplation stage at baseline, F(2, 349) = 5.06, p < .01, ηp2 = .03, and were less likely to 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 13 
intend to quit at baseline, F(2, 349) = 3.50, p < .05, ηp2 = .02.  Where appropriate, the following 
analyses statistically control for the possible effects of these differenc es on the findings.  
Relationships Between Stages of Change and Motivation  
 Table 1 presents the descriptive data for theory o f planned behavior variables and nicotine 
dependence across the stages of change.  As predict ed, across each stage of change, theory of 
planned behavior variables increased in value, wher eas nicotine dependence decreased.  
Polynomial-based orthogonal contrasts (linear and q uadratic) with an adjustment for unequal 
sample sizes (Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991, p. 473) wer e used to test for discontinuity patterns across 
the stages of change (see Table 1; Sutton, 2000).  For each variable, the data show a clear 
statistically significant linear pattern across the  stages of change: For example, on average, people in 
the precontemplation stage did not intend to quit s moking ( M = 1.82, SD  = 0.92), whereas people in 
contemplation reported more positive intentions wit h respect to quitting and scored around the 
midpoint of the intention scale ( M = 3.96, SD  = 1.87).  In contrast, people in preparation had v ery 
positive intentions toward quitting, scoring close to the end of the scale on average ( M = 6.12, SD  = 
0.96).  Despite being measured on different scales,  the zero-order correlation between stage and 
intention was .78 ( p < .01).  The one exception to this pattern of find ings is for nicotine dependence, 
but the effect size associated with the significant  quadratic trend is much smaller than that 
associated with the linear trend (Table 1).  In sum , the cross-sectional data support the construct 
validity of the stages of change measure.  
Effects of the Implementation Intention Intervention 
 The effects of the implementation intention intervention on the principal outcome 
measures were tested initially using a series of mixed ANCOVAs, controlling for  the effects of 
baseline stage of change and baseline intention, which had been shown to differ between g roups.  
Condition  (experimental versus active control versus passive control) was the between-
Stages of change and targeting interventions 14 
participants factor, and time  (baseline versus follow-up) the within-persons factor.  Quitting, 
nicotine dependence, and variables from the theory of planned behavior were the dependent 
variables.  The data presented in Table 2 show there were four significant condition x time 
interactions, for quitting, nicotine dependence, intention and perceived control.  These effec ts 
were decomposed in three steps.  First, within-participants differences bet ween baseline and 
follow-up were tested using independent repeated measures ANOVAs.  Second, between-
participants differences in the dependent variables at follow-up were tested using ANCOVAs 
controlling for the dependent variables at baseline.  Third, any differences betwe en the three 
conditions were clarified using simple contrasts.  
 Within-participants analyses demonstrated significant levels of quitting in t he 
experimental condition, F(1, 114) = 15.80, p < .01, ηp2 = .12,  but very little quitting in the 
passive, F(1, 114) = 1.00, p = .32, ηp2 = .01, or active control conditions, F(1, 119) = 2.02, p = 
.16, ηp2 = .02.  Consistent with this, ANCOVA of follow-up quitting showed significant 
differences, F(2, 349) = 10.47, p < .01, ηp2 = .06, with simple contrasts showing that the 
experimental condition differed significantly ( ps < .01) from both control conditions (the two 
control conditions did not differ significantly from one another, p = .77).  Thus, there was 
significantly more quitting in the experimental group (Figure 2).  More specifically, 12 .17% 
(14/115) who received the experimental manipulation quit, as opposed to 1.67% (2/120) in the 
active control and 0.87% (1/115) in the passive control group.  
Consistent with the preceding analyses, nicotine dependence did not change significantly 
across time in the passive control group, F(1, 114) = 1.00, p = .32, ηp2 = .01.  There were, 
however, significant decreases in nicotine dependence in both the active control,  F(1, 119) = 
18.31, p < .01, ηp2 = .13, and experimental conditions,  F(1, 114) = 20.87, p < .01, ηp2 = .15.  
These potential differences between conditions were clarified using ANCOVA , which was 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 15 
significant,  F(2, 349) = 12.32, p < .01, ηp2 = .07, with significant differences between the 
experimental group and both the passive control ( p < .01) and active control ( p < .01) conditions.  
Thus, although there were significant decreases in nicotine dependence across the c ourse of the 
study, the effects were most pronounced in the experimental condition (Figure 2).  
The behavioral intentions of participants in the passive control group actually declined 
over time, albeit not statistically significantly, F(1, 114) = 1.25, p = .27, ηp2 = .01.  In contrast, 
intention to quit increased significantly in the active control,  F(1, 119) = 10.39, p < .01, ηp2 = .08, 
and experimental conditions,  F(1, 114) = 13.58, p < .01, ηp2 = .11.  ANCOVA of potential 
differences between conditions at follow-up was significant,  F(2, 349) = 6.09, p < .01, ηp2 = .07, 
with simple contrasts showing that participants in the experimental group had significa ntly 
greater intentions than participants in the passive control condition ( p < .01) but that the 
experimental and active control conditions did not differ significantly from one another ( p = .73, 
Figure 2).  Thus, intention to quit significantly increased across the course of the study to a  
similar extent in both the active control group and experimental condition, but not in the passi ve 
control condition.  
Perceived control marginally decreased over time in the passive control group, F(1, 114) 
= 2.25, p = .14, ηp2 = .02, and marginally increased in the active control group,  F(1, 119) = 1.69, 
p = .20, ηp2 = .01.  In contrast, the perceived control of participants in the experimental condition 
significantly increased between baseline and follow-up,  F(1, 114) = 6.97, p < .01, ηp2 = .06.  
Consistent with these analyses, ANCOVA of potential differences between condi tions at follow-
up was significant,  F(2, 349) = 5.61, p < .01, ηp2 = .03, with simple contrasts showing that 
participants in the experimental group had significantly greater perceived control at  follow-up 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 16 
than participants in the passive control condition ( p < .01) but only marginally stronger perceived 
control than participants in the active control condition ( p = .08, Figure 2).  
 The preceding analyses show that the experimental manipulation significantly incr eased 
quitting, intention and perceived control, and significantly reduced nicotine dependence 
compared to the passive control condition.  In contrast, the only significant differences  between 
the experimental and active control conditions were with respect to quitting and nicotine  
dependence.  The implication is that asking participants to form a plan significantly i ncreased 
intentions and perceived control, but that only by additionally forming an implementation 
intention was behavior actually changed.  Content analysis of the statements revealed t hat all the 
people who subsequently quit wrote out implementation intentions but these did not differ 
noticeably from those who wrote out implementation intentions but didn’t subsequently quit.  
One difficulty is that the field setting precludes testing the hypothesized automati c operation of 
implementation intentions.    
Effects of the Implementation Intention Intervention: Moderating Effects of Stage of  Change 
 The potential moderating effects of stage of change on the effects of the imple mentation 
intention intervention were tested using a series of mixed ANOVAs.  Condition  (experimental 
versus active control versus passive control) and stage of change (precontemplation, 
contemplation, preparation) were the between-participants factors, and time  (baseline versus 
follow-up) was the within-persons factor.  The dependent variables were quitting, ni cotine 
dependence, behavioral intention and perceived control (cf. Table 2).  The data presented i n 
Table 3 show there was just one significant three-way interaction, where quitting w as the 
dependent variable,  F(4, 341) = 3.27, p < .05, ηp2 = .04.  These data show that, of the people who 
received the implementation intention intervention 35.29% (6/17) quit if they had been in 
preparation at baseline, compared with 7.69% (4/52) who had been in precontemplation at 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 17 
baseline and 8.70% (4/46) who had been in contemplation at baseline. ANCOVA, controlling for 
baseline, showed these differences were significant, F(2, 115) = 5.33, p < .01, ηp2 = .09.  Simple 
contrasts confirmed that the implementation intention intervention was more potent for  people in 
preparation at baseline, compared with either precontemplation or contemplation ( ps < .01).  The 
implication is that although implementation intentions are effective regardle ss of stage of 
change, they are most effective for people who are preparing to change.   
Discussion 
 The present study was designed to examine whether merely planning to change one’s 
behavior could account for the effects of previous implementation intention studies, to e nsure 
that such interventions could work in nonstudent samples, and to see whether the stages of 
change could moderate the effects.  There were three key findings.  First, impleme ntation 
intentions were effective in encouraging people to quit.  Second, the study showed that the 
effects of implementation intentions could not be explained by planning alone: Planning 
increased intention and perceived control but did not increase quitting.  This is consiste nt with 
Gollwitzer’s (1999) theory that motivation and volition are independent.   Third, the effect s of 
the implementation intention intervention were moderated by stage of change: 35% (6/17)  of 
smokers who were initially in the preparation stage subsequently quit, compared to 8% (4/52) i n 
the precontemplation stage and 9% (4/46) in the contemplation stage.  The following discussi on 
considers the conceptual and practical implications of this work. 
Taking the sample as a whole, 12% (14/115) quit smoking in the experimental condition 
compared with 1% (3/235) of smokers who quit in the two control groups and the question arises 
as to how these effects compare with transtheoretical model-based tailored  approaches.  Based 
on Velicer et al.’s (2006) review, it was possible to compute relative benefit r atios for each of the 
studies.  The best relative benefit ratio was 2.27 (.25 ÷ .11) for the expert system over a relevant 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 18 
control condition (Prochaska et al., 1993).  Comparing the present experimental condition with 
the active control condition in the present study produced a relative benefit ratio of 7.30 (r elative 
benefit ratio = 14.00 for experimental over passive control).  Although it is important  to highlight 
the disparity in terms of length of follow-up between the present study and those reviewed by 
Velicer et al. (2006; 18 months versus 2 months in the present study), the present findings are  
encouraging.  Moreover, in contrast with studies reported in Velicer et al.’s (2006)  review, the 
present intervention was tested against an equivalently active control group, meani ng that several 
potential demand characteristics can also be ruled out.  Crucially, participants  in the present 
active control condition were asked to plan to change their behavior, but were not asked 
explicitly to link critical situations with appropriate behavioral responses.  The  implication is that 
the impressive effects obtained in implementation intention intervention studies t o date (see 
Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) cannot be attributed to planning effects, but the specific  linking in 
memory of critical situation with appropriate behavioral response.    
In contrast with the effects on smoking behavior, the present study showed no differences 
in cognition between the active control group and the experimental group.  Thus, compared with 
the passive control condition, asking people to make plans to change their behavior increased 
their intentions and perceived control but these effects did not lead to a change in behavior.  Thi s 
is consistent with the idea that motivation and volition are independent of one another (cf . 
Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006), and implies that motivation may not be sufficient to engender 
health behavior change.    
The present findings also cast doubt on Jackson et al.’s (2005, 2006) claims that 
implementation intention effects are attributable to the use of student sampl es that are more 
compliant with task demands.  The present study showed that implementation intentions were  
effective in a sample that was broadly representative of the smoking population.  The impl ication 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 19 
is that other factors potentially explaining Jackson et al.’s (2005, 2006) null effects mus t be 
explored.  For example, the participants in both Jackson et al. (2005, 2006) studies were highly 
motivated and it is therefore arguable as to whether their participants were  experiencing any 
breakdown in self-regulation that implementation intentions could deal with.  
Consistent with Armitage’s (2006) study into dietary change, the proportion of smokers 
quitting was greater still for those who were in preparation at baseline (35%, 6/17) as  opposed to 
those in precontemplation (8%, 4/52) and contemplation (9%, 4/46).  The implication is that 
implementation intention-based interventions can be administered to large popula tions of 
smokers, but will be most effective if resources first allow for targeting.  The present study 
shows that the stages of change may be important in terms of audience segmentation, in other  
words, in targeting intervention efforts at those who are most likely to change.  Furthe r work that 
uses the stages of change as a tool for segmenting audiences is required.  However, it i s worth 
noting the valid concerns of Herzog and Blagg (2007) regarding the stage of change algorithm.  
Clearly, Herzog and Blagg’s (2007) data show a different pattern to ours and it would be 
valuable to clarify where these differences lie in future research, for exa mple, between: US 
versus UK smokers, passive versus proactive recruitment of participants, single- item versus 
multiple-item measures of motivation, and samples with 68% women versus 51% women (s ee 
also Etter & Sutton, 2002; Kraft et al., 1999; Quinlan & McCaul, 2000; Sciamanna et al., 2000).  
Conceptually, the present study extends laboratory-based research in two important 
respects.  First, by demonstrating that implementation intentions were able to over come a habit-
forming behavior such as smoking in a field setting, the present study adds to a growing body of 
laboratory work showing that implementation intentions possess the key properties of habits  (see 
Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).  Second, by controlling for the effects of the planning instruct ion, 
the implication is that the “active ingredient” within an implementation intention i s the linking of 
Stages of change and targeting interventions 20 
critical situation with appropriate behavioral response.  This means it is possi ble to distinguish 
implementation intentions from other related planning exercises such as goal se tting or action 
planning: The key to an effective intervention seems to be the explicit linking of critical  situation 
with appropriate behavioral response, and it would be valuable to establish whether other  related 
techniques can be augmented using this “active ingredient”.  
More generally, further work might fruitfully look at guided implementation intentions, 
whereby a health professional, in consultation with a client, identifies the appropriat e 
specification for their implementation intention.  Indeed, considering the present fi ndings in 
conjunction with Velicer et al.’s (2006) implies that interactive elem ents (e.g., feedback) in 
conjunction with implementation intentions might further enhance the effectiveness  of both types 
of intervention.  
Potential Limitations 
 A number of potential criticisms of the study should be noted.  First, it would be valuable 
to replicate the present findings over a time period greater than two months because  the 
maintenance of behavior is commonly defined as commencing six months after initial 
performance of the health behavior (e.g., Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983).  However, there a re 
grounds for cautious optimism.  First, although 6 months is used as the norm for establishing 
maintenance of behaviour, this criterion is arbitrary.  In fact, empirical evid ence supports the 
view that maintenance can come sooner, particularly in the case of behaviors that have  high 
frequency of performance in stable contexts (see Armitage, 2005).  Second, there is a  large body 
of evidence demonstrating that greater initial health behavior change is associa ted with large 
improvements in ongoing health behavior change (e.g., Jeffery, Wing, & Mayer, 1998) meaning 
that maximizing early treatment gains is a key area for further research.  Thir d, other studies 
have shown that the effects of implementation intentions on behavior persist over much longer  
Stages of change and targeting interventions 21 
periods of time, and so it seems plausible that the present findings would persist beyond t he two 
months allowed by the employers in the present study (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).   
A second possible limitation concerns the measure of behavior, which was self-reporte d.  
While it would be desirable to have a more objective measure, there are grounds for conf idence 
in the present findings.  First, there was a clear dissociation between self-re ports of behavior and 
self-reports of cognition: Whereas self-reported cognition changed as a resul t of the planning 
instructions, self-reported behavior did not.  If reporting biases did account for the present  
findings, it is unclear why these would affect behavioral outcomes and not psychological 
outcomes.  Second, one of the principal outcome measures (the revised tolerance quest ionnaire) 
has demonstrable reliability and validity when compared with biological measures of  smoking 
(e.g., Fagerstrom & Schneider, 1989; Tate & Schmitz, 1993) and the Surgeon General’s Repor t 
of 1990 (Department of Health and Human Services, 1990) concludes that biological validati on 
techniques (e.g., continine assessments) are unnecessary for most smoking cessat ion trials, 
particularly in studies with fewer than 15,000 participants (see also Velicer e t al., 1992).  Third, 
the effects of implementation intentions have been demonstrated in relation to object ively 
verifiable outcome measures (e.g., Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006), providing further conf idence in 
the present findings.   
Conclusions  
 Although previous research on transtheoretical model-based and implementation 
intention-based interventions can be criticized on grounds of having used passive control groups, 
the present study found little evidence to suggest that active control groups affect ra tes of 
quitting.  In addition, there was further support for the idea that the stages of change ma y prove a 
valuable tool in deciding where to direct resources.  Further research is needed to est ablish ways 
in which to further enhance the effectiveness of implementation intention-based int erventions.

Note .  All analyses control for stage of change and intention at baseline.  aF refers to the condition x 
time interaction. bQuitting is scored 1 = not quit, 2 = quit.  Given that quitting is a binary outcome 
variable with a 90:10 split thereby potentially threatening the robustness  of ANCOVA, these data 
were reanalyzed using a series of nonparametric tests.  The findings of the nonparametric texts are 
identical to those reported here.  The ANCOVAs are preferred because: (a) nonparametric tests 
cannot control for the baseline differences attributable to randomiz ation problems, (b) nonparametric 
tests cannot test for interactions, (c) effect sizes can be compute d for all analyses, and (d) it allows 
comparability across the analyses.

RESULTS     
  Participant flow  13  Flow of participants through each stage (a diagram 
is strongly recommended). Specifically, for each 
group report the numbers of participants randomly 
assigned, receiving intended treatment, completing 
the study protocol, and analyzed for the primary 
outcome. Describe protocol deviations from study 
as planned, together with reasons.

  Baseline data  15  Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics 
of each group.

  Numbers analyzed  16  Number of participants (denominator) in each 
group included in each analysis and whether the 
analysis was by "intention-to-treat". State the 
results in absolute numbers when feasible ( e.g ., 
10/20, not 50%).  
 8, 10 -14  
  Outcomes and 17  For each primary and secondary outcome, a 10 -14

estimated effect size and its precision ( e.g. , 95% 
confidence interval).  
 
  Ancillary analyses  18  Address multiplicity by reporting any other 
analyses performed, including subgroup analyses 
and adjusted analyses, indicating those pre-
specified and those exploratory.  
 10 -14  
  Adverse events  19  All important adverse events or side effects in 
each intervention group.

study hypotheses, sources of potential bias or 
imprecision and the dangers associated with 
multiplicity of analyses and outcomes.
