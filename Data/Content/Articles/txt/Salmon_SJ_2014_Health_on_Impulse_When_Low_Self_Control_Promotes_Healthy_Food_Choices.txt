Objective: Food choices are often made mindlessly, when individuals are not able or willing to exert
self-control. Under low self-control, individuals have difficulties to resist palatable but unhealthy foodproducts. In contrast to previous research aiming to foster healthy choices by promoting high self-control,this study exploits situations of low self-control, by strategically using the tendency under theseconditions to rely on heuristics (simple decision rules) as quick guides to action. More specifically, theauthors associated healthy food products with the social proof heuristic (i.e., normative cues that conveymajority endorsement for those products). Method: One hundred seventy-seven students (119 men), with
an average age of 20.47 years ( SD/H110052.25) participated in the experiment. This study use d a 2 (low vs.
high self-control) /H110032 (social proof vs. no heuristic) /H110032 (trade-off vs. control choice) design, with the
latter as within-subjects factor. The dependent variable was the number of healthy food choices in afood-choice task. Results: In line with previous studies, people made fewer healthy food choices under
low self-control. However, this negative effect of low self-control on food choice was reversed when thehealthy option was associated with the social proof heuristic. In that case, people made more healthychoices under conditions of low self-control. Conclusion: Low self-control may be even more beneficial
for healthy food choices than high self-control in the presence of a heuristic. Exploiting situations of lowself-control is a new and promising method to promote health on impulse.

Most models of health behavior assume that a high level of
self-control is a prerequisite for making healthy food decisions(e.g., Hofmann, Friese, & Wiers, 2008 ;Schwarzer, 2008 ). Never-
theless, food decisions are often made mindlessly in an impulsiveway, when individuals have low self-control and consequently areunable to exert the effort to warrant a well-considered, balanceddecision ( Bargh, 2002 ;Wansink & Sobal, 2007 ). Whereas previ-
ous research and interventions in healthy eating behavior fre-quently attempted to promote the exertion of self-control (e.g.,Herman & Polivy, 2011 ), we contend that this may not be the best
option to increase healthy food choices. Rather, our approachseeks to render the impulsive and automatic choice the healthierone, by exploiting situations of low self-control rather than fight-ing them. Our approach rests on typical characteristics of impul-sive decision making under low self-control conditions that can be
mobilized to foster healthier choice behavior.
Self-Control and Food Choice
Self-control refers to the ability to alter or override impulsive
responses and regulate thoughts and behavior ( Carver & Scheier,
1981 ;Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999 ;Vohs & Baumeister, 2004 ). High
levels of self-control are related to several positive outcomes, suchas more academic success and higher level of overall well-being(de Ridder, Lensvelt-Mulders, Finkenauer, Stok, & Baumeister,
2012 ;Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone, 2004 ). In addition, high
self-control has positive effects on health-related outcomes, suchas increased levels of healthy eating, less binge eating, reducedalcohol consumption, and more physical exercise ( de Ridder et al.,
2012 ;Tangney et al., 2004 ;Wills, Isasi, Mendoza, & Ainette,
2007 ). In contrast, low self-control has been associated with ad-
verse consequences such as decreased task-related performanceand unhealthy behaviors, such as engaging in unprotected sex,indulging in alcohol, and consuming sugary and fatty foods ( de
Ridder et al., 2012 ;Friese & Hofmann, 2009 ;Hernandez, &
Diclemente, 1992 ;Tangney et al., 2004 ).
It is important to note that recent research has shown that
self-control relies on a limited resource, akin to a strength orenergy ( Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998 ;Hagger,
Wood, Stiff, & Chatzisarantis, 2010 ;Muraven & Baumeister,
2000 ). Repeatedly exerting self-control will use up the resource,
impairing subsequent self-regulatory success, a state known asself-regulatory resource depletion (or ego-depletion). In such aThis article was published Online First March 11, 2013.

state of low self-control, effortful and reflective planning becomes
difficult and people typically have to resort to nonreflective, im-pulsive decision-making strategies. It is important that a state ofresource depletion has been found to heighten sensitivity to im-mediate and concrete environmental influences, such as temptingfoods and other situational cues ( Bruyneel, Dewitte, Vohs, &
Warlop, 2006 ;Hofmann, Strack, & Deutsch, 2008 ). Conversely,
high self-control individuals are better able to transcend the lure ofthe here and now and use a more effortful, reflective strategy ofbehavior regulation, in line with longer term goals and values (e.g.,Baumeister, Gailliot, DeWall, & Oaten, 2006 ;Hofmann, Friese, &
Strack, 2009 ).
Because of these properties, more traditional approaches to
health promotion have typically relied on fostering increased levelof self-control, in such guiding frameworks as the theory ofplanned behavior ( Conner, Norman, & Bell, 2002 ), the health
belief model ( Rosenstock, 1990 ), and protection motivation theory
(Bandura, 2004 ). Strikingly, though, these efforts to raise self-
control to face the challenges of overcoming unhealthy consump-tion has seen only limited success ( Herman & Polivy, 2011 ;
Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ). Indeed,
ample research has shown that the bulk of health-related (con-sumption) choices are made under mindless conditions, whenself-control is low rather than high ( Bargh, 2002 ;Wansink
& Sobal, 2007 ). As a result, chances for health promotion might be
substantially improved when this default state of reduced self-control is accepted and exploited rather than challenged andfought. This calls for examining strategies that rely on the prop-erties of decision making under low self-control conditions fortheir effectiveness. This is a key objective of the present research.More specifically, we argue that a low level of self-control doesnot by definition have to result in unhealthy food intake. Rather,we propose that whether food decisions will be healthy or un-healthy under these conditions depends on external cues availablein a situation. Specifically, we argue that low levels of self-controlmake individuals more impulsive and more prone to external,environmental cues. We also argue that when such cues prompt theindividual to make more healthy decisions, low levels of self-control result in an impulsive adoption of healthy choices. Weattempt to make the healthy option the impulsive one by associ-ating it with an external salient cue, in the form of an influenceheuristic.
Heuristic Food Decision Making
Under conditions of low self-control, individuals have the ten-
dency to use impulsive decision-making strategies, such as relyingon salient cues or heuristics ( Fennis, Janssen, & Vohs, 2009 ;
Janssen, Fennis, Pruyn, & Vohs, 2008 ). Heuristics are quick and
simple decision rules that are assumed to save self-control re-sources, by excluding part of the information ( Gigerenzer &
Gaissmaier, 2011 ;Shah & Oppenheimer, 2008 ). Heuristics,
thereby, provide an automatic and “easy way out” for individualswho are low in self-control.
External influence heuristics include the principles of reciproc-
ity(the felt need to return a favor), scarcity (the need to acquire
what is less available), and social proof (the tendency to adopt the
option preferred by others; Cialdini, 2009 ;Lun, Sinclair,
Whitchurch, & Glenn, 2007 ). Each of these principles can betranslated into simple influence tactics. For example, the social
proof heuristic can be translated into a tactic making group normssalient. In a well-known study on towel use in hotels, respondentswere asked to reuse their towels, rather than having them refresheddaily during their stay. Towel reuse almost tripled by simplycommunicating on the door hanger that “a study showed that amajority of people in this room (e.g., room 313) chose to reusetheir towels” ( Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008 ). There
are however also examples in the domain of health behavior.Whereas the food industry often promotes palatable, unhealthyfood choices by means of heuristics, such as heuristics of socialproof or scarcity (e.g., limited edition), we suggest that theseheuristics may also work in a healthy direction. A first piece ofevidence from Fennis et al. (2009) demonstrated that simple tactics
such as paying consumers a compliment or offering them a modestincentive (inducing the reciprocity heuristic) promoted behaviorsrelevant for one’s health (monitoring one’s eating behavior for 2weeks). It is important that this research showed that these behav-iors in response to salient heuristics were especially prevalentunder low self-control, when individuals would otherwise not beinclined to engage in these behaviors.
Taken together, we hypothesize that the negative effect of low
self-control on food choice only occurs when no influence heuris-tic has been presented: when the healthy option is associated withan influence heuristic, we expect individuals under low self-control to make more healthy food decisions, in line with theheuristic. We, thus, expect that in the presence of a heuristic, lowself-control individuals are equally capable of making healthychoices as individuals under high self-control conditions. Further-more, to test more stringently the assumption that low self-controlonly predicts unhealthy food decisions when the food choicerepresents a self-control conflict between a palatable option that isimmediately gratifying and a healthy option that is beneficial in thelong term ( Dhar, 1997 ;Wang, Novemsky, Dhar, & Baumeister,
2010 ), we manipulated whether or not the food choice represents
a self-control dilemma. Half of the decisions are trade-off foodchoices representing a self-control conflict between healthy andtasty food products, whereas the other half represent food choicesbetween healthy versus unhealthy food products that are equallytasty and, thus, do not consume self-control resources. We expectthat the proposed effects would only occur in case of trade-offchoices that represent a self-control dilemma.
Method
Participants and Design
One hundred seventy-seven students (119 men), with an average
age of 20.47 years ( SD/H110052.25) participated in the experiment in
exchange for money ( €3.50) or course credit. The study used a 2
(self-control: low vs. high) /H110032 (social proof heuristic vs. no
heuristic) /H110032 (trade-off choice vs. control choice) mixed design,
with the latter as within-subjects factor.
Procedure
In this study, we investigate whether we can promote healthy
food choices under low self-control conditions in an innovativeway by using an influence heuristic. We will manipulate theThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

influence heuristic of social proof by presenting salient statistical
information about the food choice of a relevant reference group. Inaddition, level of self-control will be manipulated by a frequentlyused ego-depleting task (adopted from Baumeister et al., 1998 ). By
doing so, we can establish the effect of an influence heuristic onfood choice under conditions of low and high self-control. Thedependent variable in our study is the number of healthy foodchoices participants make in a food-choice task.
The experiment was presented as a study about written media
and marketing. Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants com-pleted a demographic questionnaire and rated their current affect.Participants were randomly assigned to the low or the high self-control condition, and performed the “E-crossing task,” an estab-lished regulatory ego-depletion task (adopted from Baumeister et
al., 1998 ; see Manipulations). Next, participants performed a food-
choice task. This task consisted of six food product pairs, in whichparticipants had to choose between healthy versus unhealthy foodproducts (three of these represented a self-control dilemma, basedon a pilot study, see Food-Choice Task). Participants were ran-domly assigned to either the social proof heuristic condition or tothe no heuristic condition. Next, participants’ goal to eat healthywas measured, after which participants were thanked and de-briefed.
Manipulations
Self-control. Following the self-control strength approach de-
lineated earlier, we used an established and validated task to varyself-control, adopted from Baumeister et al. (1998; see also Hagger
et al., 2010 , for an overview of this and other paradigms to induce
differential levels of self-control). To be more specific, in the highself-control condition, participants had to cross out all the letters“e” in a text, whereas in the low self-control condition participantshad to cross out all the letters “e” in the first part of the text, andthereafter, in the second part of the text, only the letters “e” thatapplied to certain complex rules, such as, “the letters E that are twospaces removed from a consonant.” Therefore, participants in thelow self-control condition had to override their first impulse tocross out all the letters “e.” The cover story for this self-controltask implied that the task was about written media. Participantsread an article that could have been published in a popular mag-azine, about a girl that decides to study at the art academy. Afterthe e-erasing task they had to fill out some filler questions aboutthe article, such as in which magazine this article could have beenpublished and what the target group of the article should be.
It is important to note that previous studies have shown that
applying complex rules for crossing out the “e’s” reliably drainsself-regulatory resources and, thus, lowers self-control abilitycompared with the condition where individuals simply crossed outevery “e” and, thus, retained their self-regulatory resources(Baumeister et al., 1998 ;Hagger et al., 2010 ).
Social proof heuristic. In the heuristic condition, the social
proof heuristic was associated with the healthy options in thefood-choice task. A pie chart was presented next to each productpair, which allegedly represented the percentage of choices ofstudents who previously participated in this experiment. Thesepercentages indicated that the majority of these participants (vary-ing from 65% to 85%) had chosen the healthy food product (forinstance the banana), without explicitly stating that the specificproduct was the healthy option. Providing statistical information
about the majority of a reference group is an established way tomanipulate social proof (e.g., Goldstein et al., 2008 ). In the con-
dition without heuristic, no statistical information about partici-pants’ choices in previous studies was provided.
Food-Choice Task
The food-choice task consisted of three trade-off and three
control product pairs. These product pairs were determined in apilot study. Participants indicated which of the two products theywould prefer at that moment. The dependent variables are thenumber of healthy choices for trade-off and for control productpairs, both ranging from zero to three.
Pilot study trade-off versus control food product pairs. In
order to pose a self-control dilemma, the food product pairs in thestudy should represent a trade-off between the goal to eat healthyand the goal to enjoy palatable foods. Therefore, these trade-offproduct pairs have to include one tempting, but unhealthy, palat-able food product, and one healthy food product that is not verypalatable. In order to select trade-off product pairs, we conducteda pilot study in a separate sample of 90 participants (60 men) withan average age of 19.69 years ( SD/H110052.05). Participants evaluated
the healthiness (e.g., “How healthy do you think this product is”)and attractiveness (e.g., “How attractive do you find this prod-uct?”) of 12 food product pairs on 7-point scales ranging from 1(not at all )t o7( very much ).
On the basis of the evaluations, three trade-off product pairs
were selected that differed significantly on the healthiness dimen-sion and on the attractiveness dimension; chocolate bar versuscereal cookie, crisps versus rice crackers with peanuts, and crispsversus mixed nuts and raisins. In these trade-off product pairs, thehealthy option is evaluated to be healthier and less attractive thanthe unhealthy option. In addition, three product pairs that did notrepresent a trade-off (i.e., that differed significantly on healthinessbut not on attractiveness) were selected out of the remainingproduct pairs as control pairs; chocolate cookie versus fruit biscuit,Dutch caramel waffle versus banana, and chocolate versus grapes(see Table 1 and2for all means and standard deviations).
Control variables. Hunger, affect, and goal to eat healthily
were measured to determine whether there were any differencesbetween conditions in these variables that might affect foodchoices.
Hunger. Hunger was measured with one item, “How hungry
do you feel at this moment?” on 7-point scales ranging from 1 ( not
at all )t o7( very much).
Affect. The extent to which participants experienced positive
versus negative affect was measured with one item, “How do youfeel at this moment?” on 7-point scales ranging from 1 ( very
negative )t o7( very positive ).
Healthy eating goal. Healthy eating goal was measured with
one item, “To what extent do you have the goal to eat healthily?”on 7-point scales ranging from 1 ( not at all )t o7( very much).

Participants reported a positive level of affect ( M/H110055.14, SD/H11005

significant differences between the four conditions, which indi-cates that randomization of participants was successful. Moreover,a chi-square test with gender as dependent variable also revealedno significant differences between conditions, /H9273

trade-off product pairs was 0.81 ( SD/H110050.85), and for control
product pairs 1.67 ( SD/H110050.96) on a scale ranging from one to
three healthy choices. The amount of healthy choices made wassignificantly related to hunger ( r/H11005–.159, p/H11005.034) and goal to
eat healthy ( r/H11005.192, p/H11005.011).Effects of Low Self-Control and Heuristic on Food
Choice
To test the effect of self-control, heuristic, and their interaction
on healthy choices for trade-off versus control product pairs, amixed ANOVA was performed, with self-control and heuristic asbetween-subject factors and choice type (trade-off vs. control) aswithin-subjects factor. There were no main effects of self-controland heuristic on the number of healthy choices made, all Fs/H110211.
However, the ANOVA revealed a main effect of choice type on thenumber of healthy choices, F(1, 173) /H11005118.82, p/H11005/H11021 .001,/H9257

.41. Participants made more healthy control choices ( M/H110051.67,
SD/H110050.96) than healthy trade-off choices ( M/H110050.81, SD/H110050.85).
There were no two-way interactions of type of choice and self-control and of type of choice and heuristic on the total amount ofhealthy choices made, all Fs/H110211.
The expected three-way interaction was significant, F(1, 173) /H11005
6.27, p/H11005.013,/H9257
2/H11005.04.1To decompose the interaction, we will
separately describe the findings for control choices and for trade-off choices. As expected, no main effects of self-control andheuristic on healthy choice were revealed for the control productpairs, Fs/H110211. Also, no significant interaction effect of self-control
and heuristic on food choice was found for the control productpairs, F/H110211 (see Figure 1 ).
For the product choices involving a trade-off, there were no
main effects of self-control ( F/H110211,p/H11005.87) and heuristic ( F/H11005
1.55, p/H11005.22) on food choice, which is in line with our expecta-
tions. A separate ANOVA with self-control and heuristic as inde-pendent variables showed an interaction effect of self-control andheuristic on healthy trade-off choices, F(1, 173) /H110059.20, p/H11005.003,
/H9257
2/H11005.05. Simple main effects showed that for participants high in
self-control, there was no difference in number of healthy choices
between the heuristic ( M/H110050.71, SD/H110050.72) and the no heuristic
condition ( M/H110050.93, SD/H110050.80), F(1, 173) /H110051.65, p/H11005.201. For
participants low in self-control, the number of healthy choices washigher in the heuristic ( M/H110051.07, SD/H110051.06), compared with the
no heuristic condition, ( M/H110050.53, SD/H110050.70), F(1, 173) /H110058.90,

Discussion
Although previous studies have assumed that high self-control is
required to engage in healthy decision making about foods, ourfindings show that the negative effect of a low level of self-control
1Because the amount of healthy choices made was significantly related
to hunger and goal to eat healthy, we added these variables as covariates tothe main analyses. Goal to eat healthy ( F/H110055.34, p/H11005.022,/H9257
2/H11005.03) was
significant as covariate and hunger was marginally significant ( F/H110053.40,
p/H11005.067,/H92572/H11005.02). The found effects remained similar; there was a main
effect of choice type, F(1, 171) /H1100512.41, p/H11005.001,/H92572/H11005.07, and the
three-way interaction remained significant, F(1, 171) /H110056.75, p/H11005.010,

on food choice can be eliminated when a choice between foods is
accompanied by an influence heuristic. These results even suggestthat the effect of self-control on food choice can be reversed in thepresence of an influence heuristic. In line with previous researchon food choice and eating behavior, participants made fewerhealthy food choices under conditions of low than under condi-tions of high self-control, when no heuristic pointing toward thehealthy option was available. However, when the healthy foodoption was associated with a social proof heuristic, participantsmade more healthy food choices under these low self-controlconditions. Our findings, thus, demonstrate that conditions of lowself-control may be even more beneficial for healthy eating be-havior than high self-control in the presence of a heuristic.
This is in line with previous research on persuasion and heuris-
tics, showing that individuals are especially prone to the influenceof heuristics when they are low in self-control (e.g., Fennis et al.,
2009 ). Under high self-control conditions, people will react less
impulsive, because their reflective system is more active. There-fore, people high in self-control may be able to override theirimpulsive tendencies toward situational influences like the socialproof heuristic. Because of these reflective capacities under highself-control, people are expected to make more deliberate, oftenhealthy, choices, regardless of whether a heuristic is available.Therefore, decision making of low self-control individuals may bemore amenable to situational influences than that of their highself-control counterparts and consequently, a heuristic pointingtoward the healthy option in case of low self-control is expected tocontribute more to healthy food choices, compared with situationsof high self-control.
Nevertheless, our findings also demonstrate that a relatively
large proportion of the choices in all conditions involved unhealthyones. It is surprising that participants still made a substantialnumber of unhealthy food choices in high self-control conditions.This is a remarkable finding, because it has often been assumedthat a sufficient level of self-control is not so much a necessary but
rather a sufficient condition to make healthy food decisions. Ourfindings suggest that high levels of self-control are not indisput-ably beneficial for healthy eating behavior. This is in line withprevious research, showing that high levels of trait self-control hadrelatively weak effects on healthy eating compared with otherbehaviors that are beneficial in the long run, such as academicperformance ( de Ridder et al., 2012 ).
Together, our findings suggest that we are not doomed to make
unhealthy food decisions under low self-control conditions. This isimportant, because the majority of food choices are made auto-matically, when individuals do not have the capacity or willingnessto exert self-control. Whether food decisions are healthy or un-healthy under these circumstances is dependent on the environ-ment in which individuals make food decisions. When an un-healthy option is suggested, people will probably decide for anunhealthy product—as has been shown in previous research (e.g.,Hofmann, Friese, et al., 2008 ). However, findings from this study
suggest that an external influence heuristic associated with thehealthy option will steer people, in a relatively mindless way thatdoes not require self-control resources, toward choosing thehealthy alternative. These findings are in line with the premises ofdual-systems theories posing that low self-control promotes im-pulsive behavior, regardless of whether these impulses relate tohealthy or unhealthy behavior.
Our findings extend the literature on influence heuristics by
showing that influence heuristics are effective in supporting peopleto make the healthy choice when trade-off decisions that pose aself-control conflict are involved. Up to now, the effectiveness ofseveral influence heuristics has been proven for a diversity ofbehaviors, such as donating money to charities, participating inresearch, or becoming a member of a specific organization (e.g.,Fennis et al., 2009 ;Janssen et al., 2008 ). However, none of these
prior studies examined behaviors in which the conflicting goals areas salient and tempting as trade-off decisions between either or notchoosing a palatable food. This research suggests that also in

situations with a salient and tempting food option that is in conflict
with a long-term goal, the influence heuristic of social proof is aneffective method to increase healthy food decisions under condi-tions of low self-control.
Furthermore, with our findings we present a novel social influ-
ence perspective on health promotion and persuasion. Prior re-search and interventions in healthy eating behavior mainly at-tempted to convince people by cognitive means, such as increasingself-monitoring, perceived self-efficacy, or perceived control(Bandura, 2004 ;Conner et al., 2002 ;Rosenstock, 1990 ). More-
over, the elaboration likelihood model for instance suggests that toeffectively influence behavior, messages should be elaborated on(Chaiken, 1980 ). Because people often do not have the willingness
or capacity to make well-deliberated decisions, health behavior isoften determined by impulsive influences. With these results, weshow that these impulsive tendencies provide a promising oppor-tunity to mindlessly steer people toward healthy food choices.
Our research has some limitations. First, the study involved
participants from a student sample who are relatively young andwell educated, including a large proportion of men. Although wedo not have any indications that our results will be different inother populations, future research should study a broader sample,in order to increase the generalizability and external validity ofthese findings. Second, the food choices participants made in-volved virtual rather than actual food choices. Future researchshould study influence heuristics in actual food choices withreal-life implications for eating behavior. On the one hand onemight argue that the impact of influence heuristics might bereduced, because the palatable qualities of the actual food itemswill become more salient, and previous work has shown that realfood items indeed present a substantial challenge to resourcedepleted consumers ( Bruyneel et al., 2006 ). On the other hand,
there is ample research showing that subtle heuristics are still verywell capable of directly affecting actual overt, behavior, bothwithin and beyond the health domain (e.g., Fennis et al., 2009 ), an
issue that future research might be able to flesh out. A thirdlimitation is that we studied only one heuristic influencing choicesunder conditions of low self-control. Future research should con-sider whether other types of heuristics can turn unhealthy choicesinto healthy ones to the same extent as the social proof heuristic.Finally, the effect sizes of our findings are in the small-to-modestrange. Nevertheless, this range of values is plausible given thesubtlety of our manipulations and the dichotomous nature of thedependent variables used. Moreover, as much research in socialinfluence testifies ( Cialdini, 2009 ), subtle social influences can
ultimately amount to substantial changes in actual behavior.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our findings demonstrate that
a state of low self-control can be used to the advantage of people’shealth when they are presented with information that suggestshealthy choices at the moment that they are most willing torespond to these suggestions. Future research should further in-vestigate how we can take advantage of people’s tendency to actimpulsively under conditions of low self-control and which typesof heuristics are effective in steering people toward the healthyoption when they are open to suggestions due to their low levels ofself-control.
Furthermore, for a fuller understanding of the role of self-
control in heuristic (food) decision making, trait self-controlshould be taken into account. Prior research found some evidencefor the relationship between trait self-control and eating behavior
(e.g., de Ridder et al., 2012 ;Gerrits et al., 2010 ;Tangney et al.,
2004 ;Wills et al., 2007 ). For instance, high trait self-control seems
to be related to more fruit and vegetable intake, and low traitself-control to more saturated fat intake in adolescents ( Wills et al.,
2007 ). Future studies should systematically explore the role of trait
self-control in actual food choices.
Finally, the current findings have implications for promotion of
and interventions on healthy eating behavior. Healthy eating startswith making healthy choices at point-of-purchase settings, such ascafeterias, kiosks, and supermarkets. In such settings, the socialproof heuristic can be relatively easily implemented without re-quiring a radical change in the decision context. An example ofhow the social proof heuristic can be implemented is, for instance,by advertising a certain product with a simple message presentinga healthy sandwich in a kiosk as “sandwich of the month,” therebysuggesting that the majority of the people who buy their lunch atthis kiosk chose the healthy sandwich. Furthermore, because mostfood choices are made without cognitive elaboration, subtlechanges in the food environment based on other influence heuris-tics, such as limited editions of healthy food products (scarcityprinciple) or suggesting that an authority approves a certainhealthy food choice (authority heuristic), may mindlessly steerindividuals toward healthy food choices.
All in all, with this study, we showed that the healthy option can
be the automatic one, by associating healthy food products with aninfluence heuristic. Applying these heuristics to food products ineveryday purchase settings may be a new and promising method toprovoke more health on impulse.
