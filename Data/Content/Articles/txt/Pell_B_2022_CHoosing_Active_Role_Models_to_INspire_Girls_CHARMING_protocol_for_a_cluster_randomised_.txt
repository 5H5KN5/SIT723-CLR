Abstract 
Background: In the UK, there is evidence that girls’ physical activity tends to decline to a greater extent than boys 
as they enter adolescence. ‘Role models’ could play a vital role in inspiring girls to become or remain physically active. 
The CHARMING Programme is a primary school‑based community linked role ‑model programme, co ‑developed in 
2016, with children, parents, schools and wider stakeholders. It involves different types of physical activity delivered 
for 1‑h each week by a community provider and peer role models (e.g. older girls from secondary schools) joining in 
with the sessions. The programme ultimately aims to increase and sustain physical activity levels among 9–10‑ year ‑
old girls. This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the CHARMING Programme and of evaluating it 
using a randomised trial.
Methods: This study is a feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process evaluation and health 
economic evaluation. Approximately 90 Year 5 (i.e. 9–10‑ year ‑old) girls will be recruited across six primary schools in 
Mid‑South Wales. Participating schools will be allocated to the programme: control on a 2:1 basis; four intervention 
schools will run the CHARMING Programme and two will continue with usual practice. A survey and accelerometer 
will be administered at baseline and repeated at 12 months. Interviews and focus groups will be conducted post ‑
intervention delivery. The primary aim is to assess feasibility of a future randomised trial via the recruitment of schools, 
participants and role models; randomisation; retention; reach; data collection completion rates; programme adher ‑
ence; and programme fidelity, views on intervention acceptability and programme barriers and facilitators. Secondary 
aims are to evaluate established physical activity outcome measures for children plus additional health economic 
outcomes for inclusion in a future full‑scale trial.
Discussion: The results of this study will inform decisions on whether and how to proceed to a full‑scale evaluation 
of the effectiveness and cost ‑effectiveness of the CHARMING Programme to improve or sustain physical activity.

Background
Physical activity is important for young people’s health 
and wellbeing, but most young people are not active 
enough to encounter health benefits [1 ]. Young peo -
ple in Wales are among the least active worldwide, 
with fewer than 20% of 11–16-year-olds meeting cur -
rent guidelines of being active 60 min a day [2 ]. Stud -
ies show that girls tend to become less active than boys 
by age 10 and that this trend continues into second -
ary school [3 ]. There is a need for earlier intervention 
at primary school age, in the transition to adolescence, 
to prevent population level declines in girls’ physical 
activity through engaging less active girls in physical 
activity and maintaining activity levels among those 
who are already active [4 ].
Both social and physical environmental factors play 
a key role in increasing physical activity levels and 
understanding physical activity choices at the individ -
ual and contextual levels is a crucial step to informing 
the design of interventions aiming to increase physi -
cal activity [5 ]. As such, interventions grounded in a 
theoretical framework designed to influence such fac -
tors and choices may be more effective than those with 
no specified theory [6 ]. With differing mechanisms 
underlying physical activity levels and extracurricular 
physical activity playing a central part, there is a need 
to devise different types of intervention approaches for 
boys and girls aged 8–12 years [7 ]. Role models are a 
potential strategy to inspire young people to become 
involved, or maintain involvement, in physical activity 
and sport [8 ]. Adolescent girls were recently shown as 
more likely to be active if they had a role model who 
played sport compared to girls with role models who 
did not play sport [9 ]. Role models might positively 
influence behaviour by contributing, along with other 
factors, to the perception of specific behaviours (e.g. 
physical activity and sport participation) as attractive, 
attainable and rewarding experiences [10]. No one indi -
vidual role model will be suitable for all young girls, 
but rather choices are made on the basis of exposure to 
family, peers and sports celebrities [8 ]. Such an inter -
vention strategy has been internationally endorsed by 
the World Health Organization (WHO) with specific 
recommendations for the use of local community role 
models to increase physical activity among females 
[11]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excel -
lence (NICE) also recommends that any practitioner 
leading physical activity initiatives, including teachers 
and volunteers, should provide appropriate role models [12]. Despite limited research and a lack of robust tri -
als, policy recommendations strongly support the 
use of role models for tackling rising inactivity levels 
among girls [12, 13].
Rationale and previous work
A formative study led by the Principal Investigator [14] 
adopted a participative community approach with key 
stakeholders to design and pilot a school-based role 
model intervention over a 12-month period. Framed by 
psychological and sociological theory, the intervention, 
CHARMING (CHoosing Active Role Models to INspire 
Girls), aims to promote key self-determination theory 
constructs and social ecological model constructs.
Main findings from this formative evaluation identified 
that (a) 28% of girls were unable to identify a role model 
for physical activity prior to the study pilot; (b) schools 
were a suitable location for the delivery of a commu -
nity-linked role model programme; (c) role models and 
desired activities could be sourced from local communi -
ties; (d) intervention uptake and attendance was positive 
(46 out of 64 girls attended; of which 76% attended 5/6 
sessions and 39% reported a black and minority ethnic 
background providing an early indicator that the inter -
vention is unlikely to widen inequalities); (e) teachers 
perceived the intervention to be beneficial, highlighting 
increased opportunities for girls to be active, challenging 
gender norms in school and developing long-term com -
munity partnerships; and (f) recommended intervention 
modifications included; role model warm-up activities, a 
longer intervention delivery and the provision of consist -
ent role models across sessions.
These results informed decisions on intervention 
refinement i.e. removing the warm-up activities, increas -
ing the length of the intervention and adding a peer role 
model component. A lack of positive role models has pre -
viously been identified as a barrier to sport participation 
for girls [15] and data show that young girls in Wales are 
insufficiently active both on a national and global scale. 
Our earlier work [14] contributes to our understanding 
of the profile of physical activity role models of preado -
lescent girls (highlighting the importance of gender) and 
suggests potential for delivering a community-linked 
role-model programme in schools. Still, further work is 
required to understand the feasibility and acceptability of 
this on a larger scale with a demographically diverse pop -
ulation. Regarding the logistical considerations of sourc -
ing peer role models, data suggests a greater influence 
when role models are relatable to the target audience Keywords: Physical activity, Children, Primary school

[16]. Hence, prior to a trial of effectiveness, which may 
be undermined by difficulties sourcing role models or 
facilitating their attendance in the programme, or wider 
implementation issues [17], further feasibility testing is 
required to investigate these issues. In order to do this, 
and pilot the methods for a full-scale trial, this study will 
assess feasibility and acceptability of the CHARMING 
programme and its evaluation design.
The aim of the feasibility RCT is to assess the feasibil -
ity and acceptability of the CHARMING programme 
and proposed trial methodology. The study will aim to 
contribute to the evidence base on improving physical 
activity outcomes for 9–10-year-old girls. Importantly, 
the study will inform decisions on whether and how to 
proceed to a full-scale evaluation of the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of CHARMING.
Study objectives
The objectives of this study are as follows:
1. Identify effective means of recruiting schools, partici -
pants and community and peer role models
2. Assess the feasibility of conducting an effectiveness 
trial, economic evaluation and assess the implemen -
tation potential of the intervention
3. Explore the acceptability of the intervention and the 
influence of school context on intervention imple -
mentation
4. Assess the extent to which each of 6 progression cri -
teria for conducting a full-scale trial are met
Methods
Trial design
This trial is a cluster randomised-controlled feasibility 
study, with allocation at the primary school–level and 
with an embedded process evaluation and health eco -
nomic evaluation. Primary schools will be recruited and 
either randomised to run the intervention or continue 
with their usual practice.
This protocol was developed in line with the Standard 
Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Tri -
als (SPIRIT) guidelines; the SPIRIT checklist (Additional 
File 1) and the study schedule displayed in Table 1.
Study setting
Six secondary schools across Mid- and South Wales will 
be recruited into the study, with their adjoining primary 
schools invited to take part. The study flowchart can be 
seen in Fig. 1.Participants
Participants will be all year 5 girls (aged 9–10) who are 
opted-in by a parent (with written informed consent) and 
who provide their own assent.
Eligibility criteria
Inclusion: All year 5 girls (aged 9–10) who are opted-in 
by a parent and who provide their own assent.
Exclusion: Children who cannot engage in physical 
activity due to medical reasons.
Intervention—CHARMING Programme
The intervention is described using the TIDiER check -
list (in Table  2). The intervention is a primary school-
based physical activity programme, which consists of 
five planned components informed by psychological 
and sociological theory, integrating self-determination 
theory (SDT) [18] and the socio-ecological model [19]. 
As such the intervention programme focuses on (i) pro -
moting children’s perceptions of autonomy, relatedness 
and competence in relation to physical activity and (ii) 
intrapersonal and interpersonal change within the school 
organisation and connections to the wider community 
and community opportunities for physical activity par -
ticipation. The intervention has been designed to support 
physical activity engagement via three key psychosocial 
mechanisms: (1) giving girls the choice of which activi -
ties are delivered will support a sense of autonomy, (2) 
providing both community and peer-role models will 
increase the likelihood of relatedness and (3) providing 
a wide-range of activities will support perceived compe -
tence within a safe space among female peers. Along with 
enhanced enjoyment of physical activity, it is anticipated 
that these mechanisms will improve autonomous motiva -
tion, leading to greater maintenance of physical activity. 
Previous research has shown associations between psy -
chological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation 
amongst the UK primary school age children [20].
The intervention logic model (see Additional File 2) 
displays the intervention planned components and how 
they link to the intended outcomes. In order to support 
organisation and delivery of the intervention, interven -
tion manuals and guidelines are provided to the coordi -
nating teacher in each primary and secondary school as 
well as the community and peer role models (see Addi -
tional File 3 for an overview of contents).
Recruitment and consent
School recruitment and retention
State funded schools in South and Mid Wales, UK, will 
be invited to take part in the study. Six secondary schools 
will first be invited via the School Health Research

Network (SHRN) and recruited to the study. These sec -
ondary schools will recruit secondary school students 
as peer role models to support intervention delivery in 
primary schools receiving the intervention. Each school 
will be asked to sign a memorandum of understanding 
to indicate their agreement to study participation. The 
memorandum will outline research processes and time -
lines, as well as roles and responsibilities.
For each secondary school, one feeder primary school 
will be purposively selected to ensure variation in soci -
oeconomic status (percentage of students eligible for free-school meals), geographic location and school 
size and using publically available contact details, and 
invited to take part in the study. In the event that a school 
declines participation, a subsequent feeder school will be 
selected and invited to take part. An invitation to partici -
pate in the study will be sent to each secondary school’s 
feeder primary schools via email. A researcher will then 
contact schools by telephone to discuss the study. Follow -
ing the same process for secondary schools, selected pri -
mary schools will also be asked to sign a memorandum 
of understanding. To maintain engagement, encourage Fig. 1 Study flowchart

retention and to thank schools for their time, they will 
be provided with quarterly newsletters from the time of 
allocation and a £200 donation following successful com -
pletion of the data collection activities. Schools will also 
receive a quarterly study newsletter, summarising study 
progress, in order to maintain school engagement, par -
ticularly for those schools allocated to control.
Child recruitment and parental consent
Two main forms of data collection will be conducted at 
baseline and again at a 12-month follow-up:
1) A survey of self-reported outcome measures2) Collection of 7-day accelerometry data (i.e. GT3X 
ActiGraph accelerometer, which is a non-invasive 
physical activity monitoring device worn on the 
waistband).
Recruited primary schools will be asked to invite all 
girls in year 5 (ages 9–10) to participate in the study at 
least 2 weeks prior to the data collection date. Year 5 girls 
will be provided with an information sheet, fully inform -
ing them of the study. Simultaneously, all the parents/
carers of year 5 girls will be sent an electronic informa -
tion sheet, fully informing them of the study and giving 
them the opportunity to opt their child in to the study. Table 2 Intervention description using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist
1. Brief name CHoosing Active Role Models to INspire Girls (CHARMING)
2. Why Less than a quarter of 11–16‑ year ‑olds meet current guidelines of being active 60 min a day. Girls are less active than boys 
and their physical activity levels drop quicker than male peers from the start of adolescence. The transition to adolescence 
is a crucial time to introduce approaches to support girls to become more active, and help stop the drop in physical activity 
among those who already are. The use of role models to promote physical activity has been recommended in international 
guidelines. Most similar studies have focused on older ages and are US‑based. Better results have been shown among 
approaches that target girls only, are based in schools, include a range of activities, use theory and work with girls to produce 
a programme. A primary school‑based role model programme, CHARMING, has been designed to increase and sustain 
physical activity levels among 9–11‑ year ‑old girls. The intervention is underpinned by psychological and sociological theory, 
integrating self‑ determination theory and the socio ‑ecological model.
3. What materials Participants will have access to materials provided by the community role models following each session. Materials will 
signpost girls and parents to opportunities to continue the activity in their community using leaflets and usual school com‑
munication channels.
4. What procedures Access to the intervention will be provided to schools upon randomisation to the intervention group. Schools receiving the 
intervention will run a 6‑ week programme consisting of five core planned components: 1‑h taster physical activity sessions (1 
per week after ‑school on school premises); community role model delivering the session, peer ‑role model(s) participating in 
each session, question and answer opportunity with role models post ‑session and sign‑posting to community physical activ‑
ity opportunities. All schools will have email access to the trial manager for any further enquiries.
The linked secondary school recruits a group of secondary school students to act as ‘peer role models’ for the intervention [i.e. 
a females aged 11–16 years who young girls might look up to as a role model for physical activity] to participate in the weekly 
sessions in the primary school and support girls’ engagement with the intervention.
5. Who provided The study manager will provide community role models and peer role models with a roles and responsibilities document. A 
recruitment poster will also be provided to the secondary school as a means of advertising the opportunity to be involved 
in the programme. The teacher will be fully responsible for recruiting and selecting peer role models to participate in the 
programme. Schools will be advised that the number of peer role models that can be involved is flexible and that this can 
depend on the level of interest in the opportunity, as well as current COVID ‑19 restrictions and bubbles. If fewer numbers 
are recruited all peer role models may wish to attend all sessions but in the event of several peer role models the school may 
wish to alternate attendance.
6. How Primary schools will be notified by email upon randomisation to the intervention group and will gain access to the interven‑
tion manual along with a programme timetable and list of community contacts via the trial manager. Each school will oversee 
the timetable planning and subsequent delivery by community role models.
Secondary schools will be notified as to whether their primary feeder school has been allocated to receive the intervention or 
control. In the event of intervention assignment, an introductory email will be sent to both the primary‑ and secondary lead 
teachers to formalise and facilitate the link for peer role model provision at each session.
The community role model will be provided with the school’s contact details, address, session timings and approximate 
number of attendees by the study manager.
7. Where Participants will access the intervention on the primary school premises.
8. When and how much The programme will consist of a one ‑hour physical activity after ‑school session delivered each week for 6 weeks. There will be 
no cost to participate.
9. Tailoring All participants will receive the same overarching programme structure; six 1‑h sessions delivered over consecutive weeks on 
the school premises.
In each intervention primary school, the local community physical activity provision is mapped to identify potential role 
models, and through communication with community providers and other physical activity stakeholders a timetable for the 
intervention is developed. This is done in collaboration with the school so that the interests and choices of the target popula‑
tion are taken into consideration when arranging the timetable.

The information sheets will detail all possible aspects 
of their child’s participation in the study, including the 
completion of a short online survey in school and accel -
erometer and options of withdrawal up to the point of 
reporting; stating that children can participate in either 
the survey or accelerometer or both. The information 
sheet will highlight that the study is about evaluating an 
after school programme, but which schools are allocated 
to receive that or act as controls is down to chance. The 
information sheet will clearly state that their child can 
still take part in the after-school programme even if they 
do not participate in the study.
Parents/carers will be encouraged to discuss the infor -
mation with their child prior to data collection. Parental 
written opt-in consent will be required for children to 
take part in the main trial components (survey and accel -
erometer). Parents/carers will be asked to return the opt-
in form if they are happy for their child to participate in 
any aspect of the study. If a parent/carer does not return 
an opt-in form to the school by the 2-week deadline, their 
child will not enter the study. The class teacher will pro -
vide daily oral reminders to the children over this period 
to ensure that they and their parents read the informa -
tion sheet and also utilise one other usual mechanism for 
communication (e.g. texts or emails home).
Child assent
All year 5 girls who have been opted in by parents/guard -
ians and are in attendance on the day of data collection 
will be reminded of the research and their potential role 
in it. This will involve the teacher/online researcher read -
ing a standardised script to the whole class, outlining all 
aspects pertaining to voluntary nature of the study, con -
fidentiality and withdrawal. The script will also empha -
sise that pupils can still take part in the after school 
programme even if they do not take part in the study 
data collection. Teachers will be advised to distribute 
the activity monitors sensitively, being mindful of issues 
relating to body image and physicality. The research team 
will also provide the option for a researcher to virtually 
join (due to COVID-19) their data collection session 
through the use of an online video call.
To reiterate the study aims and assent process, the first 
page of the survey (whether electronic or paper-based) 
will include a simple information and assent section for 
year 5 girls. This will also outline all aspects pertaining 
to voluntary nature of the study, confidentiality and with -
drawal. Information on how to complete the survey and 
skipping questions will be included. The child will be 
required to complete the assent statements for both the 
survey and activity monitor.
Pupils who have not been opted into the study by their 
parents, or who choose not to take part, will be provided with alternative activities by their teacher. This will also 
be the case for any boys within the year 5 classroom 
in the event that teachers need to keep the whole class 
together during data collection.
Sample size
As this study is focused on feasibility, the purpose is to 
provide estimates of key parameters for a future full-scale 
trial, rather than to power the current study to detect 
statistically significant differences. A total of 90 children 
within 6 recruited primary schools (allowing for an aver -
age of 15 girls in year 5) will allow an estimation of feasi -
bility criteria with reasonable precision across a diverse 
range of context (e.g. intervention fidelity, completion of 
assessments, and valid primary outcome data). For girls 
within the intervention schools only (n=60), we will esti -
mate that 50% will attend the intervention (i.e. minimum 
of one session) within ±12.7 percentage points using 
a 95% confidence interval. Similarly, for girls from all 
schools (n=90), the parameter of 70% returning valid pri -
mary outcome data can be estimated within ±9.5%, and 
80% will complete baseline/follow-up to within ±8.3%.
Randomisation
Randomisation will be completed at primary school-
level and will be randomised to the intervention or con -
trol group with a fixed ratio of 2:1 schools, respectively. 
We will stratify by Local Authority (LA), depending on 
how primary feeder schools are recruited with each LA. 
If within one LA not enough schools are recruited to 
achieve a 2:1 ratio, we will ensure balance by reverting to 
a 1:1 ratio ensuring that at least one schools is allocated 
to each arm within an LA. An independent statistician at 
Cardiff University Centre for Trials Research (CTR) will 
randomise the schools after all six schools are recruited 
to the study to minimise drop out after randomisation. If 
a school withdraws before baseline data collection, they 
will be replaced with another randomly selected school 
from the same strata and retain the allocation of the 
school that withdrew. If a school withdraws after base -
line data collection and the school has been informed 
of intervention allocation but none of the intervention 
has been delivered, the school’s baseline data collection 
will be reported and included in the ITT analysis. If a 
school withdraws after baseline data collection and they 
have started the intervention, then they are not replaced. 
The school will be followed-up as normal unless the 
school withdraws fully from the trial and follow-up at 12 
months. Allocations will be blinded from the trial statisti -
cian and health economist. The schools will be informed 
of the allocation after baseline data is collected from the 
students. All study staff and participants will be blinded 
at baseline data collection.

Outcome measures
The outcomes that will be reported in this feasibility 
study are as follows:
Primary outcomes 
• Average daily minutes spent in moderate-to-vigor -
ous physical activity (MVPA) measured using 7-day 
accelerometer data.
Secondary outcomes 
• Number of schools and children recruited, randomly 
allocated and retained at 12-month follow-up meas -
ured using recruitment data, attendance registers and 
interviews.
• Assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of the 
evaluation design and methods for a future full-scale 
trial measured using interviews and focus groups.
• Assessment of intervention fidelity (delivery) meas -
ured using teacher logbooks, attendance registers 
and session observations.
• Assessment of intervention acceptability to children 
(girls and boys), parents, school staff and role models 
measured through interviews and focus groups
• Assessment of the feasibility of conducting an eco -
nomic evaluation in a future full-scale trial using a 
pilot cost consequence analysis, testing pupil self-
reported outcomes measures (Child Health Utility-
9D (CHU-9D) [21] and EQ-5D-Y [22]).
• Assessment of sedentary time and time spent at dif -
ferent physical activity intensities within specific seg -
ments (e.g. during the club, after school or at week -
ends) measured using 7-day accelerometer data at 
baseline and 12-month follow-up.
Progression criteria for a potential future trial
Criteria for progression to a full-scale trial will be used to 
inform a decision on whether and how to proceed. Each 
progression criterion (PC) is outlined below.
1. The intervention is implemented with fidelity (in a 
manner in line with intervention theory) in at least 3 
of 4 intervention schools.
2. At least 50% of assenting children in the intervention 
schools attend 50% of the scheduled sessions.
3. The process evaluation indicates the intervention is 
acceptable to children, parents, school staff and role 
models.Progression criteria relating to obtaining data regard -
ing completion of outcome measures will be assessed 
using the following progression criteria:
4. At least 3 of 4 intervention schools and 1 of 2 control 
schools are retained throughout the study. At least 
80% of children approached complete the baseline 
and follow-up accelerometer measures. Proceed: 80% 
of children complete baseline and follow-up accel -
erometer measure; Stop: < 50%; Review: 50–79% of 
children complete.
5. At least 70% of recruited children who receive an 
accelerometer return valid data (>3 days of 600 min -
utes including 1 weekend day) at baseline and follow-
up for the primary outcome measure. Proceed: 70% 
or more; Stop: <40%; Review: 40–69%
These criteria have been agreed in advance of data 
collection with the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). 
The TSC will consider the quantitative and qualitative 
data [ 23] to review and make an overall judgement on 
whether the intervention can be delivered with fidel -
ity. Potential impacts of COVID-19 will be consid -
ered as well as risk of generalisability bias [24]. In line 
with development guidance for feasibility studies [25], 
the study does not aim to provide an indication of the 
effectiveness of the intervention; given the small, pur -
posively selected sample, such an estimate would not be 
meaningful.
Data collection
In the current climate, many (if not all) schools will not 
allow non-staff members access to their premises. There -
fore, minimal face-to-face data collection methods have 
been included within the current project. Data collec -
tions will be mainly teacher-led (with virtual attendance 
by an online researcher where requested) and an elec -
tronic survey method offered. Where data collection 
materials need to be provided to the school (e.g. activity 
monitors and paper surveys), we have developed a safe 
contactless delivery approach.
Data collection will be overseen by the class teacher in 
normal class time. Teachers will be provided with a study 
introduction sheet which contains a script that they will 
read out to their pupils, along with some ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ .
Classroom report
Using a standardised template, the teacher will be asked 
to provide count information on the number of parental 
opt-ins, number of absentees and the number of pupil 
opt-outs (via hard copy or electronic).

Survey
The survey will be made available in English and Welsh 
and will be self-completed by pupils within the classroom 
under teacher supervision during school hours. Data col -
lection will be facilitated by electronic data capture using 
a bespoke Qualtrics database, and paper copies of the 
survey will also be made available. Schools will be asked 
when signing up to the study if they would prefer elec -
tronic or pen and paper format. Each child opted into the 
study by their parents/carers will be allocated a unique 
Participant ID ahead of data collection, ensuring all par -
ticipant data are pseudonymised.
The survey will collect data on demographics (age, gen -
der and ethnicity), self-reported physical activity (Physi -
cal Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C 
scale)) [26], psychosocial outcomes (activity-based per -
ceptions of autonomy, relatedness, competence and 
enjoyment), current after-school sport or physical activ -
ity club attendance (school and community) and health-
related quality of life ((CHU-9D [21] and the EQ-5D-Y) 
[22]). Three schools will complete the EQ-5D-Y, and 
three schools the CHU-9D to reduce burden on pupils 
completing the questionnaires, whilst retaining the abil -
ity to answer feasibility questions. All questions will be 
closed response, with an ‘I do not want to answer’ option 
provided throughout. For electronic survey collections, 
the software will enable partial survey completions to be 
captured.
Activity monitor
Participants will also be asked to wear a GT3X Acti -
Graph accelerometer on the right hip for seven consecu -
tive days (during waking hours) and complete a monitor 
wear diary. Activity monitors will be clearly numbered, 
charged and initialised for assessment. Each child opted 
in by their parents/carers will receive an activity moni -
tor, an activity monitor diary and parental instructions. 
The activity monitor diary will ask participants to keep 
a record of the time they removed the belt, reason for 
removal and time they placed the belt back on. This will 
allow any water-based activities such as swimming to be 
captured. Participants will return their monitor and diary 
to school after 7 days following which study items will be 
collected by the research team before the data is down -
loaded and securely saved for processing.
Follow‑up
Twelve months after baseline data collection, both sets 
of data collection modes outlined above will be repeated 
as a follow-up assessment. Three weeks prior to this, 
schools will send a reminder to parents/guardians to 
make them aware of the remaining data collection in school. Processes described above for electronic survey 
and accelerometry data collection will be repeated in the 
following week.
Withdrawal and loss to follow‑up
Participants will be able to withdraw from the study up 
until publication of the results. Our default position if 
a participant withdraws from the study but does not 
request destruction of their data will be to retain data 
already collected; however, the participant will have the 
option to withdraw their data as outlined in the par -
ticipant information sheets. The main trial information 
sheets will advise pupils, parents and carers on with -
drawal procedures in relation to both the survey and 
accelerometer data; namely that the survey records data 
entered throughout and therefore pupils will need to 
specify to their teacher or parents/carers that they wish 
to withdraw their survey data, who will then inform the 
research team. Pupils will be advised to also tell their 
teacher or parents/carers if they wish to withdraw their 
activity monitor data, so that they can again inform the 
research team to organise withdrawal. Once a participant 
has withdrawn no further data will be collected from 
them.
Process evaluation
In accordance with the Medical Research Council frame -
work [27], the embedded process evaluation will explore 
intervention acceptability and the feasibility of imple -
menting the intervention (including the extent to which 
the intervention was delivered as planned) and aim to 
understand mechanisms from the perspectives of par -
ticipants and others and explore the context in which the 
intervention was conducted. Exploration of context will 
include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to sepa -
rate out what is happening due to the context of COVID 
and what might be transferable to non-COVID times. 
The process evaluation will use both quantitative and 
qualitative measures as outlined below.
Quantitative methods
At each intervention school the teacher overseeing 
intervention delivery will complete a weekly attendance 
register to record pupil attendance across sessions. The 
teacher will also complete a delivery logbook, using a 
standardised template, to assess whether community role 
models delivered the planned components (see Addi -
tional File 2) of each session fully, partially or not at all 
(i.e. fidelity scores). The focus on delivery of the compo -
nents will be with regards the function of the compo -
nents in line with the intervention theory, rather than 
specific form of delivery. A project team member will 
observe two randomly selected sessions in each school 
Page 10 of 14 Pell et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2022) 8:2 
also completing the logbook template as a form of verifi -
cation of teacher-assessed fidelity scores.
Qualitative methods
At each intervention school, one-to-one interviews with 
teachers overseeing intervention delivery (1 per school), 
head teachers or member of the senior leadership team 
(1 per school), parents of participating girls (2 per school) 
and community role models (4 per school) will be con -
ducted. Interviews will explore acceptability and feasibil -
ity of implementation of the intervention.
Three focus groups (involving 6 pupils in each) will 
be conducted at each intervention school with a sample 
of girls who have participated in the intervention and a 
separate group of year 5 boys. The focus group will be 
conducted at two-time points with the sample of girls, 
immediately post-intervention and 3 months later to 
explore experiences of the intervention, acceptability 
and barriers and facilitators to participation and longer 
term experiences of physical activity beyond interven -
tion receipt. The focus group with boys aims to explore 
acceptability and potential unintended consequences of a 
targeted intervention for girls.
All peer role models will be invited to participate in a 
focus group at the end of intervention delivery to explore 
feasibility and acceptability of the peer role model com -
ponent of the intervention and barriers and facilitators 
to involvement. We will also explore perceptions of ‘how’ 
the intervention is perceived to have worked or not and 
gather contextual considerations (e.g. COVID context 
and what’s specific to that, transferable beyond it).
Adverse events
A risk assessment has found this trial to be low risk. All 
schools will be asked to notify the research team of any 
serious instance which is perceived to be study-related by 
submitting an anonymised version incidence report form. 
Any safeguarding issues arising during data collection 
will be reported immediately (and within 24 h of knowl -
edge of the event) to the main school contact. The PI 
will continue to monitor reports and determine whether 
they are adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events 
(SAEs). There are no expected adverse events related to 
the CHARMING Programme or research procedures.
Data analysis
Statistical analysis
The main outcomes in this feasibility trial are the rates 
of consent and recruitment (schools, peer-role mod -
els, year 5 girls), and retention at 12-month follow-
up. Analysis of these data will be mainly descriptive 
(means and SD, median and 25th to 75th centiles for 
non-normal distributions, or N and %) as appropriate. Descriptive comparisons of these data will be made 
between intervention and control arms. Loss to follow-
up in intervention and control groups will be reported. 
Demographic characteristics will be summarised 
descriptively as appropriate. We will characterise indi -
viduals that are lost to follow up at 12 months (with 
respect to demographics and intervention engagement.
For schools receiving the intervention, summary 
statistics will be presented for intervention reach and 
fidelity measures overall and by school/LA. This will 
include the proportion of recruited girls attending the 
first session, a minimum of one session and the num -
ber of session attendances per individual (max of 6). 
Mean (SD) or median (25th to 75th centiles) attendance 
per session will be calculated and summary statistics 
will be calculated on peer-role model engagement (e.g. 
attendance rates). Session attendance and presence or 
absence of the intervention components (role model 
delivering and participating in each session, question 
and answer opportunity with role models post-session, 
sign-posting) will be presented over time, overall and 
by school.
Accelerometry data will be analysed using a batch 
processing protocol; continuous periods of 60 min 
of zero counts will be considered as ‘non-wear time’ 
and removed. All data between 23:00 and 06:00 will be 
removed to ensure focus on awake time. Participants will 
be included in the analysis if they provide a minimum 
inclusion of 3 valid days. The percentage of original par -
ticipants retained to 12-month follow-up who provide 
valid useable accelerometry data will be reported. Aver -
age counts per minute (CPM) will be used as a measure 
of total physical activity. Using the Evenson cut-points 
[28], the average daily minutes spent sedentary (cut-point 
of < 100 CPM), in MVPA (≥ 2296 CPM) and time-seg -
ment-specific time spent in each activity intensity (e.g. 
during club, after school or at weekends will be esti -
mated using 7-day accelerometer data and summarised 
overall and by trial arm. Mixed-effects linear regres -
sion will be used to estimate direction of intervention 
effects on accelerometer-measured physical activity on 
the adjusted mean difference between intervention and 
control groups, alongside a 95% confidence interval (CI). 
School-level variance will be accounted for by inclusion 
of school as a random effect, and any remaining differ -
ences in the baseline assessment of the outcome measure, 
and local authority area (by which the randomisation was 
stratified), as fixed factors. The school-level intra-class 
correlation (ICC) coefficient for average daily minutes of 
MVPA over the 7 days will be estimated alongside a 95% 
CI. Whilst likely non-significant due to limited power, 
this should be in the direction of a favourable interven -
tion effect.

 Pell et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2022) 8:2 
 
Response rates and level of completion of the survey 
measures such as (self-reported physical activity (PAQ-C 
scale), psychosocial outcomes (activity-based percep -
tions of autonomy, relatedness, competence and enjoy -
ment) and current after-school sport or physical activity 
club attendance (school and community), at baseline and 
12-month follow-up will be reported using descriptive 
statistics. Regression models will also be used to estimate 
direction of intervention effects on 12-month survey 
outcomes. Mixed-effect models will take the clustering 
of individuals in schools into account using a random 
model and adjust for baseline outcomes.
All analyses will be intention to treat (i.e. students will 
be analysed in the groups in which their school was ran -
domised to, regardless of adherence to the intervention) 
and missing outcome data will not be replaced. The anal -
ysis and reporting of this cluster randomised controlled 
trial will be in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines {Eldridge, 2016 
#354}.
Economic analysis
A Health Economics Analysis Plan (HEAP) in accord -
ance with the main statistical analysis plan will set out 
the objectives and methods for data collection and analy -
sis of the health economics findings. A pilot cost conse -
quence analysis will test the feasibility of conducting an 
economic evaluation in a future full-scale trial. Response 
rates and level of completion of the economic measures 
of EQ-5D-Y, CHU-9D at baseline and 12-month follow-
up will be reported using descriptive statistics taking 
account of clustering. Ceiling effects in the health-related 
quality of life measures EQ-5D-Y and CHU-9D will be 
assessed.
During teacher interviews at intervention schools, 
questions will be added to explore if it is feasible to iden -
tify and measure the resources required to deliver the 
intervention to estimate a cost per programme and per 
participant, using micro-costing methodology used suc -
cessfully in previous studies [29, 30].
Topic Guide questions will inquire about time taken 
to set up and delivery the intervention, such as time to 
recruit role models, session planning, and liaising with 
local organisations to deliver sessions. We will liaise with 
teachers responsible for intervention delivery to gather 
this information, including information on teacher salary 
band.
Teacher costs will be sourced from the National Union 
of Teachers (NUT) [31] pay structure for qualified class -
room teachers in Wales. School based costs will be col -
lected from a Local Education Authority perspective, 
accounting for on-costs (e.g. national insurance and pen -
sion costs), and using the cost year 2020–2021.Parents taking part in the one-to-one interviews will 
be asked about their willingness to answer questions 
regarding their child’s use of primary care such as the 
GP , nurse, and hospital services, and whether there 
are other services they feel are important to include. 
Whether parents would be willing to complete a ques -
tionnaire at study time points (e.g. at baseline and 
follow up) and what format they would prefer the ques -
tionnaire to be in (e.g. paper or online). These questions 
would help inform the development of a Client Service 
Receipt Inventory (CSRI) as part of a cost-effectiveness 
analysis in a subsequent definitive randomised con -
trolled trial.
All analyses will be conducted using intention to treat 
analysis (i.e. students will be analysed in the groups in 
which their school was randomised to, regardless of 
adherence to the intervention) and missing outcome data 
will not be replaced. The health economics component of 
the study will be written up in accordance with the Con -
solidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Stand -
ards (CHEERS) statement [32].
Qualitative analysis plan
Interviews and focus groups will be recorded using an 
encrypted audio recorder and stored on password-pro -
tected computers. All recordings will be transcribed ver -
batim and fully anonymised prior to analysis. Computer 
software NVivo v12 will be used to manage and analyse 
qualitative data and transcripts. Thematic analysis will 
be used to analyse all focus groups and interviews. The -
matic analysis of focus groups and interviews will exam -
ine acceptability, feasibility, fidelity and engagement. 
Triangulation of the process evaluation data will be used 
to combine qualitative and quantitative data analysis. For 
questions specific to the health economic analysis, the 
anonymised transcribed sections of these responses will 
be sent securely to the health economist, who will man -
age the analysis of the responses to explore the accept -
ability and feasibility of a CSRI and intervention costing 
survey. If there is consensus in the data as to what ques -
tions/items that should be included in these question -
naires, this will be reported to help inform a future 
cost-effectiveness analysis.
Trial management
The sponsor is Cardiff University. The study will be sup -
ported by the Cardiff University CTR, which is a fully 
registered Clinical Trials Unit. The Sponsor had no role 
in the design of this trial and will not have any role during 
its execution, analyses, data interpretation or decision to 
submit results.
Page 12 of 14 Pell et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2022) 8:2 
Study management committee
The Study Management Group (SMG) will meet 
monthly throughout the course of the study and will 
include the chief investigators, co-applicants, collabo -
rators and study manager. The SMG will be responsi -
ble for overall trial management and ensuring the study 
adheres to the protocol.
Trial steering committee
A TSC will meet approximately every quarter to pro -
vide study oversight. The TSC comprises eight mem -
bers in total. These include two independent academics 
(one of whom is the Chair), an independent statistician, 
two policy leads, a deputy head teacher and the study 
principal investigator (PI) and study co-PI. The TSC 
will provide independent oversight for the study.
Data management
Quality control
Data from the paper surveys will be entered into the 
Qualtrics database by the Trial Manager (TM) and/or 
Data Manager (DM) retrospectively. Quality checks 
will take place every 5 participants entries, 50% of 
which will be quality checked and for which error rates 
will be calculated. The acceptable rate of error will be 
<1% and should the calculated percentage exceed this, 
and the trial team will be trained again.
Data protection and participant confidentiality
Access to the Qualtrics database will only be given to 
the TM or DM. Should paper surveys be used, these will 
be held separately and securely in a locked cupboard, 
with access limited to essential research team members. 
All study data will be anonymised, stored securely and 
password protected. All data will be securely stored on 
Cardiff University’s internal server with secure transfer 
between team members. All procedures for data col -
lection, handling, storage and management will com -
ply with GDPR. Anonymised quotations will be used in 
reporting results. Only the trial team will have access to 
the final dataset. All research staff involved will have up 
to date GCP training.
Auditing
No independent audits are planned.
Confidentiality
All data will be kept for 15 years in line with Cardiff  
University’s Research Governance Framework Regula -
tions for clinical research. Electronic data will be stored 
confidentially on password-protected servers main -
tained on University networks. All hard copy forms will be stored in locked filing cabinets. Audio files for quali -
tative interviews and focus groups will be recorded on 
encrypted audio-recorders and securely held in pass -
word-protected servers maintained on university net -
works. They will be transcribed and pseudonymised 
using university-approved transcription companies. No 
identifiable data will be published.
Dissemination policy
A publication plan and dissemination policy will be 
written. Study results will be disseminated through 
peer-reviewed scientific journals. Two publications are 
expected, one reporting quantitative and health eco -
nomic outcomes and the second reporting process evalu -
ation outcomes. On completion of the study a final report 
will be prepared for Health and Care Research Wales. 
The study results will be disseminated in full and with a 
lay summary on the DECIPHer websites, and a summary 
of the results will be disseminated to all schools. Any data 
requests should be made to DECIPHer.
Public involvement
During the development of this study, we consulted with 
a young people’s advisory group (ALPHA) to inform the 
refinement of the intervention and identification of peer 
role models. The Youth Sports Trust Young Ambassa -
dors are providing ongoing insights into the recruitment 
of peer role models and community provision through a 
series of consolation events. A primary school has been 
identified as a Public Involvement school to inform the 
development of process evaluation tools.
Discussion
Despite the need for a physical activity intervention tar -
geting girls within the primary school setting there is 
currently a significant gap in the evidence base and avail -
ability of suitable programmes. The CHARMING Study 
directly addresses this gap. The results of this feasibility 
study will contribute to the evidence base on improving 
outcomes for young girls physically activity, including 
potential unintended consequences of targeting interven -
tion at girls only. In addition, the findings from this feasi -
bility study will determine the progression to a full-scale 
trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
the CHARMING Programme and will inform parameters 
of study design specifically recruitment processes, meth -
ods of data collection and choice of outcome measures.
