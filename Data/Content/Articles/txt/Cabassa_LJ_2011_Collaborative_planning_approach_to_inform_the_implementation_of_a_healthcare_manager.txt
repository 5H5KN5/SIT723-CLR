Abstract
Background: This study describes a collaborative planning approach that blends principles of community-based
participatory research (CBPR) and intervention mapping to modify a healthcare manager intervention to a new
patient population and provider group and to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this modified interventionto improve the physical health of Hispanics with serious mental illness (SMI) and at risk for cardiovascular disease(CVD).
Methods: The proposed study uses a multiphase approach that applies CBPR principles and intervention-mapping
steps –an intervention-planning approach –to move from intervention planning to pilot testing. In phase I, a
community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders will be assembled to learn and review the
intervention and make initial modifications. Phase II uses a combination of qualitative methods– patient focus
groups and stakeholder interviews –to ensure that the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. Phase III
uses results from phase II to further modify the intervention, develop an implementation plan, and train two care
managers on the modified intervention. Phase IV consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30) to assess the
feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention and explore its initial effects. Lastly, phase V consists ofanalysis of pilot study data and preparation for future funding to develop a more rigorous evaluation of themodified intervention.
Discussion: The proposed study is one of the few projects to date to focus on improving the physical health of
Hispanics with SMI and at risk for CVD by using a collaborative planning approach to enhance the transportability
and use of a promising healthcare manager intervention. This study illustrates how blending health-disparities
research and implementation science can help reduce the disproportionate burden of medical illness in avulnerable population.
Introduction
This manuscript describes an innovative, collaborative
intervention-planning approach that capitalizes on bothresearchers ’and stakeholders ’knowledge and skills to
inform pre-implementation work to transport a promis-ing healthcare manager intervention to a new patientpopulation and provider g roup. Our approach builds
upon the growing interest in using community-basedparticipatory research (CBPR) as a translational strategyto bridge the gap between research and practice inunderserved diverse communities in the United Statesin order to reduce health inequities [1]. We combined
principles from CBPR ( e.g., capacity building, ownership)
and an intervention mapping (IM)– a step-by-step sys-
tematic framework for intervention planning, implemen-
tation, and evaluation [2] –to modify and assess the
feasibility and acceptability of an existing care manager(CM) intervention to improve the physical health ofHispanics with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g.,s c h i z o -
phrenia) and at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Background
Compared to non-Hispanic whites with SMI, Hispanics
with SMI have higher rates of obesity [3], diabetes [4,5],and other metabolic risk factors[6,7], placing them at
elevated risk for CVD. The se health needs are exacer-
bated by the fact that Hispanics with SMI and at risk
for CVD are less likely to engage and receive high-qual-ity medical care, even against the backdrop of the poor-quality care received by people with SMI [8]. Despitehigher risk and disparities in care, limited attention hasbeen paid to the process of making interventions shownto improve the physical healthcare of people with SMI,
such as CM interventions, culturally relevant to Hispa-
nics with SMI. Cultural modi fications are important
because unique sociocultural factors ( e.g.,c u l t u r a l
norms) influence access and quality of care, and theprovision of culturally sensi tive care increases engage-
ment and treatment retention [9]. Provider-level modifi-cations are also needed because many public mentalhealth systems –the main source of healthcare for Hispa-
nics with SMI [10] –lack sufficient numbers of registered
nurses (RNs) [11,12], the provider group for whomthese interventions have been designed. The absence ofan established approach for systematically conductingintervention modifications and pre-implementationwork in order to expand the intervention ’su s ew i t ha
new patient population and provider group withoutcompromising its effectiveness constitutes an implemen-
tation research gap. This study uses a collaborative plan-
ning approach that blends principles of CBPR and IM tomodify and assess the feasibility and acceptability of anexisting CM intervention to improve the physical healthof Hispanics with SMI and at risk for CVD.
Study aims
The specific aims of this study are as follows:
1. Use a collaborative interv ention-planning frame-
work to conduct intervention modifications.
2. Pretest intervention methods and materials with
Hispanics with SMI and at risk for CVD.
3. Identify stakeholders ’views of factors impacting the
acceptability and sustainability of the modifiedintervention.
4. Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the
modified intervention and initially explore its effect.
Care manager interventions
CM interventions are a cornerstone of initiatives toimprove the health of people with multiple and complexphysical and mental health conditions [13-15]. CMinterventions improve receipt of primary care services,social functioning, independent living skills, and the
quality of life of people with SMI and medicalconditions linked to CVD ( e.g., hypertension) [16,17].
The Primary Care, Access Referral and Evaluation
(PCARE)[18], a CM intervention developed by one ofthe authors (BGD), focuses on improving patient activa-tion and the coordination of medical care between out-patient mental health clinics and primary care. In a
recent randomized controlled trial, the intervention was
found to double the rate of receipt of preventive medicalcare and to improve the quality of cardiometabolic careand mental-health-related quality of life among adultswith SMI [18]. CMs do not provide direct medical ser-vices; instead, they work individually with patients in themental health clinic to provide education and activationand to connect patients to primary care, as well as coor-
dinate their medical care between mental health and
primary care providers.
Adapting the intervention to a new patient population
and provider group
Adapting any healthcare intervention to a new popula-
tion requires consideration of both sociocultural andsystem-level factors that can affect its uptake. Adapting
PCARE to Hispanics provides an example of attention
to both patient and system-level considerations.
First, unique sociocultural factors that impact patient
activation and care coordination– core elements of CM
interventions –need to be examined and incorporated
into the intervention to ensure its acceptability, feasibil-ity, and effectiveness in the new population. Sociocul-tural adaptations involve surface- and deep-level
modifications [19]. Surface mo difications entail match-
ing intervention materials, messages, and content to the
observable characteristics of the new patient populationin order to enhance the intervention ’s“face validity. ”
Examples of surface elements include delivering the pro-gram in the patient ’s dominant language ( e.g.,S p a n i s h )
to reduce language barriers and drafting all patient edu-cational materials at the appropriate reading level ( e.g.,
fourth grade) to enhance health literacy. Surface adapta-tions are a prerequisite, but they may not be sufficientto attain cultural sensitivity; thus, deep-level modifica-tions are required.
Deep-level modifications entail identifying and incor-
porating into the intervention patients ’cultural values,
understandings, and preferences that impact core inter-vention elements [19]. The qualitative research con-
ducted by our team with six behavioral health
organizations in the Northern Manhattan communitiesof New York City serving Hispanics and African Ameri-cans with SMI illustrates ho w sociocultural factors
impact patient activation and care coordination [20].The medical encounter itself, for example, is shaped bycultural factors. We found that many Hispanics withCabassa et al .Implementation Science 2011, 6:80
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/80Page 2 of 12
SMI, who are disenfranchised due to their mental illness
and minority status, feel that it is inappropriate and dis-respectful to directly question their doctors’ advice. CMs
need to recognize this deference to authority and adapttheir patient-activation techniques accordingly, such asby modeling appropriate interactions with providers and
helping patients formulate a list of questions before
their medical visit [21]. Similarly, we found that bodyimage varies across cultures, with some Hispanicpatients favoring a fuller body ideal [22,23]. Unad-dressed, this can lead to the perception among Hispa-nics that medical recommendations that focus onthinness may be culturally insensitive. CMs can deal
with this by assessing patients ’explanatory models of ill-
ness and using this information to present medical goalscongruent with patients ’views ( e.g., focusing on health
rather than thinness). Also, in contrast with many whiteconsumers, most Hispanics with SMI live with theirfamilies [24-26], who are involved in their medical care.This suggests that family members should be includedin medical care decisions, as appropriate, to enhancethis source of support. The se examples illustrate the
kind of deep modifications needed to ensure that theintervention is congruent with patients ’culture, without
diluting its effectiveness [19,27].
Second, whereas PCARE was developed for use with
RNs, these practitioners were in short supply both inour study site and in other sites where Hispanics withSMI receive their care [11]. In our study site, for exam-ple, social workers (SWs) outnumber RNs 2.5:1. Since
CMs provide no direct medical care, our plan to modify
the intervention to SWs is appropriate and essential toincrease applicability to the target population. SWs are anatural fit for the CM role because they [1] deliverapproximately 60% of the mental healthcare in the Uni-ted States [28], particularly in the public system; [2] canbill for care management functions at our study site;and [3] work closely with minority communities. Their
expertise in counseling and systems navigation match
the skills required for effective care management. Multi-ple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of SWsas CMs across a range of mental and physical illnesses[29-32]. To modify PCARE f o rS W sr e q u i r e st h a tt h e y
receive extra training on how to use existing guidelinesto monitor and coordinate the management of the phy-sical health needs of people with SMI [33], deliver
appropriate physical health information to patients, and
coordinate medical care between mental health and pri-mary care providers. SWs will also require more intenseclinical training on how to manage the medical needs ofpatients with complex medical problems. Due to medi-cal and legal regulations, SWs will need more structuredand regular supervision and involvement from existing
RNs and/or primary care providers.Lastly, the addition of this intervention to the study
site requires attention to providers ’attitudes and expec-
tations about the interven tion and identifying what
resources are needed to accommodate the interventioninto routine practice. More generally, adapting interven-tions to vulnerable ethnic subpopulations calls for close
attention to not only cultural factors but also to these
provider and system-level considerations.
Collaborative planning approach
Figure 1 presents the collaborative framework for thisstudy, which blends CBPR principles and IM proceduresto plan and implement these cu ltural and system-level
modifications. CBPR in intervention research can be
conceptualized as a translational strategy that focuses on
co- learning, engendering ownership, and two-way capa-city building among all partners to address a sharedhealth concern and develop sustainable solutions [1].CBPR differs from other knowledge translationalapproaches for its emphasis on community members ’
participation as equal contributors in creating knowl-edge and skills that inform the implementation process
[34-36]. According to Wallerstein and Duran [1], CBPR
enhances the potential of implementation sciences indiverse communities through the use of strategies that“redress power imbalances, facilitate mutual benefits
among community and academic partners, and promotereciprocal knowledge translation incorporating commu-nity theories into the research ”(p. S1). CBPR principles
in our framework include a focus on a shared health
concern identified by our community partners, forma-
tion of a community advisory board (CAB) of commu-nity and academic partners to maximize the relevance ofthe intervention and incorporate community knowledgeand wisdom into the implementation process, and invol-ving partners in all modification steps to enhance theircapacity for adopting and using the intervention.
Although CBPR approaches have been used to modify
interventions to address heal th disparities [37,38], the
procedures for how to carry this out remain unspecifiedand difficult to replicate. Clear guidelines and proce-dures are needed to help community members andresearchers move through a collaborative process toplan, implement, and evaluate health interventions (seeBelansky and colleagues [39] for a recent example). Ourcollaborative framework ad dresses this limitation by
using IM in a CBPR partnership (see Additional file 1)[40]. IM “road maps” planners ’moves from theory to
practice. It uses core processes ( e.g., brainstorming, lit-
erature reviews, data collection) and visual tools, such aslogic models and matrices of performance objectives, toclarify intervention goals and how to attain intendedoutcomes [40]. Similar to CBPR, IM relies on bringingtogether a planning team or linkage system that includesCabassa et al .Implementation Science 2011, 6:80

researchers, program participants, potential program
users, and other stakeholders to inform intervention
planning, implementation, and evaluation. Most IM pro-
jects to date have tended to be driven by researchers
and/or public health interventionists [40]. More recently,
several teams have begun t o incorporate community
members ’participation and leadership into the process
[39,41]. Our approach will build upon these recent
examples.
The six steps of IM that inform intervention modifica-
tions are [1] problem analysis, [2] review of intervention
objectives and theoretical fou ndations, [3] modification
of intervention methods and strategies, [4] development
of a revised intervention, [5] development of an imple-
mentation plan, and [6] evaluation [42]. Each step
includes specific tasks leading to a product ( e.g.,l o g i c
model) that is the basis for the next step. The result is
an“intervention map ”consisting of tables, logic models,
and written plans that guide the modification, imple-
mentation, and evaluation of the intervention [2]. Wechose IM over other adaptation models [43-45] because
[1] it relies on group members ’input throughout the
entire process; [2] at each step the goals of the interven-
tion are emphasized, engendering participation of CAB
members with divergent backgrounds; and [3] it devel-
ops an implementation plan, composed of objectives
and strategies, that supports the adoption and use of the
intervention in a new context. In sum, this collaborative
framework provides a structured and participatory plat-
form for directing interven tion modifications and pre-
implementation work.

generation Dominican. About one-third of residents live
in poverty, 31% lack health insurance, and 25% lack aregular medical home [46]. WHCS serves those mem-bers of the community that are most disenfranchised asa result of SMI. In 2008, WHCS had 1,030 patients, ofwhom 75% were Hispanics, 40% were male, and 90%
had schizophrenia-spectrum or bipolar disorder. A study
of 69 WHCS patients (78% Hispanic) revealed theirpoor health status [3]. Although 67% had had a physicalexam over the past year, 89% of women and 59% ofmen were overweight/obese (body mass index > 25 kg/m
2). Many had elevated rates of CVD risk factors:
hypertension (29%), hyperlip idemia (22%), and diabetes
(17%). The proposed modified CM program aims to
help address these needs.
Study design overview
The project will use a multiphase approach (see Table 1)
that applies IM steps to move from intervention plan-ning to pilot testing. Study phases are described below.
Phase I
During phase I, we will assemble the CAB composed ofone primary care physician, one WHCS social worker,two consumer advocates ( e.g., former consumers), one
clinic administrator, and the research team to inform allphases of the project. Use of a CAB is an establishedCBPR strategy for modifying interventions as it helpsframe and monitor the progress of the project and pro-vides guidance on cultural values and practices as well
as community assets that deepen the contextualization
of the intervention [47]. The CAB will meet monthlyduring phase I and every three months through phasesII-V. IM steps 1-3 will be completed in this phase. IMstep 1 (problem analysis) entails deepening CAB mem-bers ’understanding of the physical health needs of His-
panics with SMI by reviewing existing literature,discussing results of a pilot qualitative study on the phy-
sical health needs of minorities with SMI [20], and dis-
cussing the capacity of the study site and othercommunity agencies to address these needs. We willalso discuss how to address possible provider-level bar-riers, such as primary care doctors ’stigma andreluctance to work with patients with SMIs and the lackof communication between primary care and mentalhealth providers. IM step 2 (review of interventionobjectives and theoretical foundations) involves learningand reviewing intervention components. Intervention
objective tables will be constructed to specify the links
between each intervention objective and the methods
used to achieve it. The CAB will determine whetherobjectives and determinants of these objectives need tobe added or deleted without compromising interventioneffectiveness and whether the intervention methods arepractical and appropriate for the new patient populationand provider group to achieve desired outcomes. In IMstep 3 (modification of intervention methods and strate-
gies), we will use results from patient focus groups
(FGs) and stakeholder interviews (see below) to guideinitial modifications. We expect to make several modifi-cations at this stage, such as translating PCARE materi-als into Spanish, developing a community resourceguide to the Washington Heights neighborhood, addingexplanatory model questions about consumers ’physical
health problems to the assessment tool, and developing
strategies to involve family members in CM sessions.
Another likely modification is to supplement the inter-
vention with culturally and linguistically appropriate
patient education tools, such as health-related fotonove-
las[48,49]. Fotonovelas use posed photographs, text
bubbles with simple text, and soap opera narratives to
engage patients and raise their knowledge about specificmedical conditions ( e.g., diabetes) and lifestyle changes.
At the end of phase 1, we will have an initial modifiedversion of PCARE.
Phase II
D u r i n gt h i sp h a s ew ew i l lc o n t i n u eI Ms t e p3a n du s equalitative methods (patient FGs and stakeholder inter-views) to pretest our initial modifications and ensuretheir feasibility and acceptability.
Patient focus groups
Four patient FGs conducted at the WHCS will be usedto pretest the intervention methods and materials. EachFG will last 90 minutes and will consist of 8-10 patients

who meet inclusion criteria for participation in the
intervention. We will recruit up to 40 adult Hispanicpatients with SMI and at risk for CVD at WHCSthrough flyers, word of mouth, and provider/peer refer-rals. Eligible patients are active patients at WHCS who
are 18 years of age or older; self-identify as Hispanic;
speak English or Spanish; and have chart diagnoses of
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disor-der and have at least one CVD risk factor (body massindent > 25 kg/m
2], diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or
hyperlipidemia). CVD risk factors are mandated by theNew York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) to bepart of patient medical records. We will exclude patientswho are in need of detoxification; are at acute risk of
suicide or homicide; fail a capacity-to-consent question-
naire [50]; or are cognitively impaired, as detected onthe Mini-Cog Examination, which does not require Eng-lish fluency or formal education [51]. To accommodatepatients ’language preferences, FGs will be conducted in
Spanish or English. LJC will facilitate all FGs. FGs willbe audiotaped and transcribed. A FG guide of six toeight open-ended questions developed with input from
the CAB and implementation research consultants will
be used to elicit patients ’views about intervention mate-
rials and methods. Questions will explore patients ’views
about the acceptability, feasibility, and cultural appropri-ateness –particularly among the main Hispanic sub-
groups in our study site (Dominicans and Mexicans) –of
the intervention, including suggestions for improvement.
Stakeholder interviews
Twenty stakeholder semi-structured qualitative inter-views will be conducted to examine the acceptabilityand sustainability of the modified intervention in a pub-lic mental health system. A purposive sample of stake-holders will be obtained, including five mental healthclinicians, five primary care physicians, five consumer
advocates, and five administrators. The aims of these
interviews are to identify factors that facilitate or impede
the acceptability and sustainability of the interventionand identify strategies to maximize its acceptability andsustainability ( e.g., adding a CM training curriculum for
SWs). Interviews will last 60 minutes and will beconducted by LJC or a trained research assistant (RA) inperson or via telephone to accommodate participants ’
availability. The option of telephone interviews enablesus to reach stakeholders across New York state. Inter-views will be audiotaped and transcribed. Participantswill be stakeholders who are at least part-time employ-
ees at their organizations and consumer advocates who
are involved in the OMH advisory committees. Recruit-ment strategies include presentations at OMH meetingsfocusing on physical/mental health integration andreferrals from the Director of Research at the OMH. Aninterview guide will be developed with input from theCAB and the implementation and qualitative consul-tants. Questions will explore factors and barriers that
influence an intervention ’s acceptability and sustainabil-
ity, such as characteristics of the intervention ( e.g.,c o m -
plexity, cost), the organization ’s financial resources and
openness to change, staff ’s capacity, knowledge, self-effi-
cacy, and competing demands [52].
Phase III
IM steps 4 and 5 will be completed in this phase inorder to further modify the intervention, develop an
implementation plan, and train two SWs from the studysite on the modified intervention. IM step 4 (develop-ment of revised intervention) will entail using phase IIfindings to reexamine, and if necessary reconstruct, pro-gram objective tables developed in phase 1. This processwill include CAB review of salient themes that emergedfrom phase II FGs and interviews, refinement of the
program ’s logic model of change, and discussions about
revising objectives, methods, and/or strategies. To
ensure that modifications do not compromise interven-tion core elements, revisions will be presented and dis-cussed with the second au thor (BD), the PCARE
developer. The goal of this step is for the CAB to deter-mine if intervention objectives and methods should beunchanged, deleted, revised, or added. Table 2 presents
examples of possible modifications.
During IM step 5 (development of implementation
plan), the CAB will formulat e specific implementation
objective tables and methods. In this step, the CAB will
(a) discuss themes that emerged from phase II

interviews and FGs regarding intervention acceptability,
feasibility, and sustainability; (b) identify existingresources ( e.g., connections with primary care clinics)
that facilitate intervention implementation; and (c)develop a performance objective table that links eachimplementation objective to the methods used to
accomplish it. The goal is to write a detailed plan of
what needs to be done to ensure the intervention isdelivered at acceptable leve ls of fidelity and complete-
ness. The plan will include CM tracking forms to logfrequency, number, and types of patients ’contacts and
clinical services. T hese will serve as fidelity indicators
for structural and clinical elements of the intervention[53].
Once the revised intervention is finalized, two SWs
will be trained. Training will consist of four 90-minuteeducation sessions that combi ne didactic presentations
and interactive hands-on activities, such as role-playing,teach-back, and practice exercises. The training will betaught by intervention developers and other project con-sultants who are experts in primary care and cardiovas-cular care. The sessions will be based on the
intervention materials, the American Heart Association
guidelines for managing CVD risk factors [54], and theNew York City Department of Health and MentalHygiene continuing education modules that reviewexisting guidelines for monitoring the physical health ofadults with SMI [33]. Training topics include ascertain-ment of CVD risk factors; monitoring these risk factorsin an SMI population; learning how to correctly obtain
simple body composition measures ( e.g., weight, height),
blood pressure assessment, an d a basic medical history;
developing patient education skills to boost patient
recall and comprehension using teach-back techniques[55]; basics of motivational interviewing techniques; useof action plans [56]; and coordination with local medicalcare services. We will also develop and train SWs onhow to follow specific clinical protocols to manage pos-
sible medical emergencies ( e.g., myocardial infarction,
diabetic ketoacidosis) that require immediate attention
by a medical provider (e.g. ,c l i n i c ’sn u r s e ,e m e r g e n c y
department). Lastly, during the pilot trial (see below)the two SWs will receive supervision every two weeksfrom the project primary care consultant, an experi-enced family physician, wh o will also provide clinical
backup in case of medical emergencies. During these
meetings, SWs will review patients ’initial assessment
and stated health goals and identify additional health
needs, potential barriers to care, and strategies forensuring receipt of services. An individualized patientreport will be generated tha t identifies key medical
issues, providers, and contacts, as well as short- andlong-term goals. A copy of this report will be given tothe patient, and if the patient consents, added to his/hermedical records and given to his/her primary careprovider.
Phase IV
This phase will complete IM step 6 (evaluation) with asingle group, pre-post, 12-month open pilot study (N =
30) carried out at WHCS. Two SW CMs will deliver the
modified intervention, eac h carrying a caseload of 15
patients. Thirty adult Hispanic patients with SMI will berecruited. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are identicalto those in phase IV. Based on the PCARE studyrecruitment rate of 69%, we will screen at least 45patients to achieve our recruitment goal. A bilingual RAwill recruit patients at WHCS through flyers, canvassing
of waiting rooms, word of mouth, and provider referrals.
We have allocated 18 months to this phase, which pro-vides a six-month cushion fo r unanticipated problems
with recruitment and attrit ion. Descriptions of the pro-
posed measures for this study are presented in Table 3.As part of the planning process for this phase, the CABwill assess the appropriateness of these outcome mea-sures for the intended patient population and, if neces-
sary, identify other culturally relevant measures for key
constructs (e.g., acculturation, health literacy, illness
perceptions).
The primary outcomes of the pilot study are feasibility
and acceptability. Two post-intervention FGs will beconducted with study participants to explore their reac-tions to the intervention. Each FG will be composed of8-10 patients and follow the FG methods described in
phase II. Although this is not an efficacy trial, we would
be remiss in not taking this opportunity to initiallyexplore the intervention ’s effect, as measured by patient
activation, receipt of preventive primary care, and physi-cal- and mental-health-related quality of life. Covariatesinclude demographics, accult uration, barriers to care,
and comorbid medical conditions. The RA will assesspatients at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Self-
report measures and medical chart abstractions will be
obtained. Patients will be as ked for consent to access
medical records at WHCS and their primary care clinic.The RA will conduct these abstractions under LJC ’s
supervision.
Phase V
This final phase will consist of analysis of pilot study
data, incorporation of pilot findings into the refinement
of the modified intervention, and preparation for futurefunding to develop a more rigorous evaluation of theintervention. A concurrent tr iangulation approach [57]
will be used to integrate qualitative and quantitativedata generated from this pilot. A set of questions willguide this data integration process to identify themes,patterns, and conflicts: What patterns emerge from eachCabassa et al .Implementation Science 2011, 6:80
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/80Page 7 of 12
set of findings? Do they converge? If not, what are their
discrepancies and what additional data and analysis areneeded to understand these discrepancies? All studyresults will be presented and discussed with the CAB toinform next steps and future plans.
Data analysis
Quantitative data entry and analysis will utilize SAS ver-sion 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). ATLAS.ti (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmBH,Berlin, Germany), a qualita tive data management soft-
ware [58], will be used to manage and analyze all quali-tative data.
Quantitative analysis
All tests will be two-sided and performed at significancelevela= 0.05.
Preliminary analyses
Preliminary analyses will consist of examining distribu-tions of all baseline variables, identifying outliers, and
calculating descriptive stati stics. For longitudinal data,
we will examine the distributions and calculate descrip-
tive statistics for variables relevant to study aims at eachtime point. Proper transformation will be considered tomeet assumptions of parametric models. Graphics willbe used to explore bivariate associations, especially pat-terns over time for variables of interest.
Accounting for missing data in the analysis
If a patient drops out of the study, we will record thestated reasons for dropout and make all efforts to obtaina final assessment. Failing this, the end-of-treatmentassessment will be the patient ’s last scheduled assess-
ment. The analysis of acceptability as measured by theClient Satisfactio n Questionnaire (CSQ) will be based
on a multilevel model with subject-specific random
intercepts. For analyses that include missing outcomes,
PROC MIXED in SAS allows for continuous data thatmay be missing for some patients due to lack of com-pletion of assessments. Measurement at each time pointon each patient contributes to the analysis. Thus, com-plete outcome information for all patients at all sessionsis not needed. For analyses that include missing covari-ates, we will use multiple i mputation to account for
missing data. The inferences from incomplete data arevalid, provided the missing data are missing at random[59]. Unfortunately, this assumption is untestable inmost medical research. When we suspect this assump-tion does not hold, we will assume a model for themissing mechanism that depends on the unobservedoutcome value and do the analysis incorporating theassumed model and conduct sensitivity analysis [60-62].
Primary analysis
To evaluate feasibility, we will estimate recruitment rate,assessment completion rate, and treatment attendancerate by sample proportions and provide their standarderrors based on binomial dis tribution. We will evaluate
acceptability by assessing patient satisfaction (CSQscores) repeatedly over time (baseline, 6 months, and 12
months). We will analyze improvement in patient satis-
faction by a linear mixed-effects model with randomsubject-specific intercepts to handle correlation betweenTable 3 Description of measures
Construct Measure description
Feasibility Study recruitment, assessment completion, and treatment attendance rates
Acceptability CSQ and postintervention focus groups. The CSQ is an eight-item questionnaire scored on a four-point Likert-
type scale. Scores range from 8 to 32, with higher score indicating higher satisfaction [68]. The CSQ is available
in English and Spanish [69] and has excellent internal consistency in Hispanics [70].
Patient activation PAM-13, [71] a 13-item scale that assesses patients ’knowledge, skills, and confidence about self-management.
Scores range from 0 (no activation) to 100 (high activation). PAM-13 has strong psychometric properties,including content and construct validity [71], has been tested across a range of chronic illnesses [72,73], and isavailable in English and Spanish.
Receipt of preventive primary care PCARE study measure drawn from the USPSTF guidelines [74]. A total of 23 indicators are examined across four
domains: (1) physical examinations, (2) screening tests, (3) vaccinations, and (4) education. Scored based onpatients ’medical records and self-report at baseline, three months, and six months. An aggregate preventive
services score calculates the proportion of appropriate services obtained [18].
Health and mental health-relatedquality of lifeSF-12 [75], a self-report measure available in English and Spanish and validated among adults with SMI thatgenerates two summary scores for physical and mental health-related quality of life [76]. Summary scores range
from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better health.
Covariates
Demographics: e.g., race/ethnicity, age, gender, education, and marital status Acculturation: nativity, language
dominance, time in the United States, age of migration; the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale [77], a 24-item
self-report measure that uses separate four-point scales to tap acculturation-related changes in two languages.
Barriers to medical care: a list of 11 common factors that may prevent patients from seeking medical care[78,79].
Comorbid medical conditions: a list of 17 common medical conditions by patient self-report.
CSQ = Client Satisfaction Questionnaire; PAM-13 = Patient Activation Measure; PCARE = primary care, access and referral; USPSTF = U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force; SF-12 = Short Form Health Survey; SMI = serious mental illness.Cabassa et al .Implementation Science 2011, 6:80

repeated measurements of the outcomes. We will
include time as predictor of interest. Significance ofimprovement in satisfaction over time will be assessedby testing whether the slope of time is zero.
Exploratory analysis
To explore the initial effect of the CM intervention, wewill assess average level of patient activation, rates ofguideline-concordant preventive primary care use, andphysical- and mental-health-related quality of life. Wewill provide confidence intervals for these estimates.
Precision analysis
Since this is a pilot study for a future large randomized
trial, we did not conduct a power analysis in accordance
with recommendations in the new National Institutes ofHealth guidelines http://grant s.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-
files/PAR-09-173.html and Kraemer and Kupfer [63].Instead, we conducted precision analysis for the mainstudy outcomes –feasibility and acceptability –by comput-
ing margin of error of an estimated rate to assess theprecision that can be achieved by the proposed sample
size. Margin of error is half the width of a confidence
interval of an estimator. The smaller the margin ofe r r o r ,t h et i g h t e rt h ec o n f i d e n c ei n t e r v a la n dt h em o r eprecision we achieve for an estimator. We used the ori-ginal PCARE [18] study treatment and completionassessment rates to estimate standard errors and mar-gins of errors. PCARE ’s observed treatment completion
rate was 0.68, with a sample size of 30, the standard
error was 0.085 and the margin of error was 0.167.
PCARE ’s observed assessment completion was 0.78 at 6
months and 0.69 at 12 months, the corresponding stan-dard error is 0.076 and 0.084, respectively, and the mar-gin of error is 0.15 and 0.17, respectively. For the CSQscores (acceptability measure), when the standard devia-tion of the improvement of CSQ is 1, 2, or 4 points, thecorresponding margin of error for estimating mean
improvement is 0.18, 0.36, and 0.72, respectively. In all,
our precision analysis indicates we have small margin oferrors for each of our main study outcomes.
Qualitative analysis
All FGs and stakeholder interviews will be transcribed.The RA will review all transcripts while listening to therecordings to fix errors. Clean transcripts will be entered
into ATLAS.ti. A grounded theory approach will inform
the analysis [64-66]. LJC and the RA will independentlyread all transcripts and develop an open coding schemabased on a priori and emergent themes. Each code con-
denses the data into analyzable units, ranging from aphrase to paragraphs. They will then meet with the pro-ject qualitative consultant to present their codingschemes, discuss emergent themes, refine codes, anddevelop a final codebook that consists of a list of cate-gories and topics. We will use ATLAS.ti to markinstances where each code occurs in the data. To estab-lish coding reliability, both LJC and the RA will inde-p e n d e n t l yc o d eu pt o1 0 %o ft h et r a n s c r i p t s .T h e yw i l lmeet weekly during this process to review definitions
and assignment of codes and resolve differences through
consensus by checking the segment of transcript inquestion. Successive coding sessions will continue untilan agreement of 85% or greater in codes applied isreached. Once this rate is maintained, a single rater willcode the rest of the data. Additional analyses willinclude identification of subthemes and descriptions ofthe range and salience of themes. Established procedures
to enhance the trustworthiness of our analysis will be
used, including analyses of negative cases that do not fitour coding scheme, development of an audit trail docu-menting analytical decisions, and member-checking pre-sentations to the CAB [67]. Qualitative results will beused to inform both surface- and deep-level modifica-tions to enhance the cultural relevance of the interven-tion. Moreover, results from stakeholder interviews will
enable us to identify implementation barriers as well as
implementation strategies that need to be taken intoconsideration as we develop the implementation plan inphase III. In sum, the qualitative analysis is intended toprovide insights into contextual factors that can informintervention planning and implementation.
Discussion
This study will contribute to the advancement of imple-mentation science by developing a collaborative approachthat blends CBPR principles and IM procedures for over-coming barriers to the modification, pre-implementation,and use of evidence-based approaches in real-world set-tings. This study ’s strengths and innovations include [1]
the testing of an innovative strategy for modifying inter-ventions to vulnerable ethnic subgroups; [2] the prepara-
tion of an intervention for Hispanics with SMI that is
urgently needed to address physical health disparitiesthat have received limited attention; [3] the modificationof a promising intervention to a different provider groupthat can improve access to preventive primary care,reduce risk for CVD, and reduce premature mortalityamong Hispanics with SMI; and [4] the engagement ofstakeholders in a collaborative effort to enhance the
transportation of evidence-based interventions to under-
served racial and ethnic minorities with SMI.
Several study limitation must be noted. This study will
be conducted in one public outpatient mental healthclinic located in northern Manhattan in New York City,thus limiting its generalizability to other urban areas inthe United States. Cultural modifications to the inter-vention will focus on Hispanic adults with SMI,Cabassa et al .Implementation Science 2011, 6:80
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/80Page 9 of 12
predominantly of Dominican or Mexican descent.
Future studies are needed to examine whether thesemodifications are appropriate with other Hispanicgroups. The open trial design of our pilot study will notpermit us to test the efficacy of the modified healthcaremanager intervention or to identify mechanisms of
change. We plan to use the results of the pilot study to
inform the design of a more rigorous effectiveness trialof the modified intervention with a larger sample of His-panic patients.
The collaborative planning framework that guides the
proposed study could be used to modify and prepareother health interventions for vulnerable populationsand advance implementation science by developing a
systematic approach for helping to close the gap
between research and practice in order to reduce healthinequities in underserved communities. The adaptedintervention will be one of the few to date to focus on acritical public health issue, improving the physical healthof Hispanics with SMI and at risk for CVD. In sum, thisstudy blends health-disparities research and implemen-tation science to help reduce the disproportionate bur-
den of medical illness and poor quality of medical care
experienced by Hispanics with SMI.
