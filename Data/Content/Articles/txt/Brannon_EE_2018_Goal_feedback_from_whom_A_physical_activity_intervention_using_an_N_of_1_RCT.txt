Objective: Adolescents are not meeting the recommended guidelines for phys-
ical activity. Social support and self-regulatory skills are two factors known toimpact physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The study sought to exam-ine how targeting feedback as part of a self-regulatory process could increase
physical activity, and the individual who should be providing the feedback.
Design: The study utilised an aggregated N-of-1 RCT which allows for an
iterative process of intervention development, and examines variability withinparticipants to answer the question for whom did the intervention work. Ten
adolescents (ages 13 –18) set a daily physical activity goal. Adolescents
received a SMS text message providing feedback on goal attainment dailyfrom a parent, peer, behavioural health specialist; or no text message (con-
trol).
Main Outcome Measures: A bioharness heart rate monitor assessed heart rate
as proxy for goal attainment. Adolescents also self-monitored their physicalactivity in the Calorie Counter and Diet Tracker by MyFitnessPal
TMapp
(commercially available).
Results: Intervention demonstrated a signi ﬁcant effect for 30% of the sample
in increasing MVPA ( Mincrease = 52 min), with no signi ﬁcant effect on seden-
tary behaviour.
Conclusion: A single occasion of text messaging from the right person can
produce changes, however, careful consideration should be given to who pro-vides the feedback.

Engagement in regular physical activity is associated with desirable health outcomes
such as aerobic ﬁtness, healthy blood pressure, decreased prevalence of obesity, overall
better psychological health (Janssen & LeBlanc, 2010 ; Sallis & Patrick, 1994 ). Given
the bene ﬁts of regular physical activity, it is recommended that children between the ages
of 6 and 17 years participate in at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity

(MVPA) daily (Department of Health & Human Services, 2008 ; UK Department of
Health, 2011 ; World Health Organization, 2010 ). However, research on physical activity
patterns indicate that MVPA signi ﬁcantly declines between the ages of 9 and 15 years
(Nader, Bradley, Houts, McRitchie, & O ’Brien, 2008 ). In fact, adolescents spend a large
amount of their time in sedentary activity with average values of nine hours per day for
total sedentary time (Cliff et al., 2016 ; Matthews et al., 2008 ). Thus, increasing adoption
of health promoting behaviours and decreasing sedentary activity, is a signi ﬁcant public
health concern (Schwarzer, 2008 ).
Two factors that are known to modify health behaviours are the use of self-regula-
tory skills and social support (Patrick et al., 2001 ; Van der Horst, Paw, Twisk, & Van
Mechelen, 2007 ). Self-regulatory skills from cybernetic control theory (Carver &
Scheier, 1982 ) such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, goal review have demonstrated ef ﬁ-
cacy in changing physical activity levels in adults (Michie, Abraham, Whittington,
McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ; Sniehotta, Presseau, Hobbs, & Araujo-Soares, 2012 ) and ado-
lescents (Aittasalo, Miilunpalo, Kukkonen-Harjula, & Pasanen, 2006 ; Cushing & Steele,
2010 ). Social support is a modi ﬁable correlate of physical activity that can be targeted
directly by interventions. Social support for physical activity refers to individuals whofacilitate engagement in physical activity, and has been shown to impact physical activ-ity and sedentary behaviour in children and adolescents (Biddle, Petrolini, & Pearson,
2014 ; Taylor, Baranowski, & Sallis, 1994 ). There are a number of meaningful individu-
als in an adolescent ’s life that could potentially provide this social support (Cushing,
Brannon, Suorsa, & Wilson, 2014 ). For example, parental support, including verbal
encouragement and instrumental support (e.g. transportation), shows a strong positivecorrelation with children and adolescents ’level of physical activity (Gustafson &
Rhodes,
2006 ; Van der Horst et al., 2007 ). Parents can also provide social support for
reducing sedentary activity by setting goals, creating a plan for turning off screens andencouraging active behaviours (Biddle et al.,
2014 ).
Although parents are important agents for encouraging youth physical activity at
younger ages, adolescents spend more time with peers who then exert more in ﬂuence
on health behaviours (Voorhees et al., 2005 ). Thus, peers can have a signi ﬁcant effect
on physical activity in adolescence in the context of mentorship (Black et al., 2010 ;
Smith, 2011 ), through the use of peer support (Beets, Vogel, Forlaw, Pitetti, & Cardinal,
2006 ), encouragement (Duncan, Duncan, & Strycker, 2005 ) and within common moti-
vations of peer acceptance and increased friendship quality (Fitzgerald, Fitzgerald, &Aherne,
2012 ). Receiving targeted feedback on health behaviours by a healthcare pro-
fessional has also demonstrated signi ﬁcant changes in improving adolescent health
behaviours (Patrick et al., 2001 ,2006 ).
Although research to date has examined parent, peer and healthcare provider inter-
ventions at the group level, static interventions do not account for or adapt to thewithin-person variability that exists in lifestyle behaviours; nor does the research exam-ine feedback singularly as a form of intervention. This in ﬂexibility likely limits the
knowledge that can be derived from any given intervention trial or the active ingredi-ents of intervention trials (Adams et al.,
2013 ). Calls in the literature underscore identi-
ﬁcation of the active ingredients and their exerting effects on behaviour change (Craig
et al., 2008 ). To date, questions regarding the theoretical underpinnings of individual
behaviour change, and the speci ﬁc components of interventions for increasing physical
activity in adults has been well-studied (Hobbs, Dixon, Johnston, & Howie, 2013 ;702 E.E. Brannon et al.
Sniehotta et al., 2012 ). There is developing research on the clinical utility of N-of-1
RCT as a novel methodology to answer these important questions at an idiographiclevel (e.g. Nyman, Goodwin, Kwasnicka, & Callaway,
2016 ). The applicability of this
type of methodology or examination of feedback providers on physical activity has yet
to be examined in a child or adolescent population.
Examining the effectiveness of an intervention at the level of the individual is vital
for articulating pro ﬁles of which individuals will respond to which treatment condition.
Parsing out the active ingredients in intervention packages, such as those based onCarver and Scheier ’s control theory, is in line with the Medical Research Council ’s rec-
ommendations for the evaluation of complex interventions (UK Medical Researh Coun-cil,
2008 ; Carver & Scheier, 1982 ). Therefore, the next step for developing tailored
interventions is to examine whether feedback from varying sources of social support
impacts the effectiveness of interventions. Armed with this information, behavioural sci-
entists can then use the dosage or type of feedback to create decision rules linking char-acteristics of the individuals with speci ﬁc levels and types of programme components.
Thus, the aims of the current study are to examine: (1) for whom the feedback on goalattainment works and (2) which of several variants of the feedback provider increasesphysical activity participation and decreases time spent in sedentary behaviour.
Methods
Participants
Thirteen adolescents were recruited for the current study (15 approached) via conve-
nience sampling through the use of ﬂyers. Flyers were placed in public places (e.g. cof-
fee shops, recreational facilities), as well as throughout the university of the ﬁrst author,
and an email was sent to university faculty. However, three participants withdrew prior
to beginning any study procedures. The inclusion criteria required that an adolescent
between 13 and 18 years of age, and report less than 60 min of physical activity perday. In the ﬁnal sample, participants included three boys and seven girls identi ﬁed using
community-based recruitment. Nine participants self-identi ﬁed as Caucasian with one
self-identifying as Hispanic, and participants had a mean age of 16.7 years (SD = .95).Regarding socio-economic status, eight had a family income greater than $60,000, onebetween $50,000 and $60,000 and one between $40,000 and $50,000. Participants werecompensated up to $40 for their participation in the study based on their compliance to
the protocol (e.g. $1 each day for wearing equipment and $15 for completing at least
75% of study surveys). At the initial visit, participants were equipped with a ZephyrBioharness 3.0 heart rate monitor to be worn 12 h each day and an Actigraphaccelerometer (Actigraph wActi Sleep-BT) to be worn on their non-dominant hand 24 hper day.
Measures
Moderate to vigorous physical activity and sedentary behaviour
Total movement was measured using the Actigraph wActi Sleep-BT accelerometer
(Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) and was the primary outcome variable. Actigraph is avalidated wireless activity monitor that provides an objective measure of physicalPsychology & Health 703
activity, sedentary activity and sleep/wake measurements. Actigraph assessments have
been shown to be highly correlated with direct observation assessment in children(McClain, Abraham, Brusseau, & Tudor-Locke,
2008 ). The device was worn on the
non-dominant hand of each adolescent for 24-h a day and is in accordance with the cur-
rent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) protocol (Troiano
et al., 2008 ). Data were ﬁltered such that a valid day was de ﬁned as having 10 or more
hours of wear time while awake, which is consistent with large epidemiological studies(Troiano et al.,
2008 ). Cut points were derived from a recent article providing MVPA
for wrist-placement accelerometry in children ages 8 –12 (Chandler, Brazendale, Beets,
& Mealing, 2015 ).
Real-time physical activity assessment
The Zephyr BioHarness 3.0 (Zephyr Technology, Auckland, New Zealand) is a wireless
physiological monitoring device. The Bioharness was worn around the chest directlyacross the rib cage just below the sternum. The device stores and transmits vital signdata including heart rate, respiration rate, body orientation and activity.
The Bioharness physiological monitoring device was utilised for real-time physical
activity data capture to inform the type of feedback participants received. The Biohar-ness was synced to the ZephyrLife mobile application via Bluetooth that allowed partic-
ipants to view their heart rate and breathing rate in real time. Participant data were also
transmitted to a web portal that graphically displayed physiological data for each partic-ipant allowing study staff to assess the participant ’s goal attainment daily. Goal attain-
ment was derived from the physiological heart rate data, to determine if participantswere in the Max heart rate or aerobic heart rate (i.e. (220 –age) * .60) for the speci ﬁed
goal each day. In circumstances where heart rate data could not be transmitted to theweb portal due to limited connectivity ( ≈62% of all observations), goal attainment was
determined from the participant ’s self-reported physical activity, as described below.
Poor connectivity was related to dif ﬁculty of data transmission via wi ﬁ, such that, when
the bioharness did not have ready access to wi ﬁthe connection was poor. The data
from the bioharness was used solely to provide information that informed feedback anddid not affect outcome data.
Self-reported physical activity
Participants provided self-reported physical activity using the Calorie Counter and Diet
Tracker within the MyFitnessPal
TMmobile application, which has been shown to incor-
porate several evidence-based strategies for health behaviour change including goal set-ting, self-monitoring, goal review and social support (Brannon & Cushing,
2015 ).
Participants were instructed to record their daily physical activity after which it was vis-ible to the study staff.
Procedure
Consistent with cybernetic control theory (Carver & Scheier,
1982 ), the intervention
included self-regulation strategies de ﬁned by goal-setting, self-monitoring, goal review
and feedback. To standardise the goal-setting process, participants were provided704 E.E. Brannon et al.
instruction on the Centre for Disease Control recommendations for adolescents between
the ages of 13 and 18 that recommend 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity(MVPA) daily (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention,
2015 ). Adolescents then set
a personal goal for minutes of daily physical activity. Participants were instructed to
perform any activity of choice as long as it met the de ﬁnition of MVPA (e.g. requires a
moderate amount of effort that increases heart rate and makes it dif ﬁcult to carry a con-
versation).
Self-monitoring occurred at the end of each day using the Calorie Counter and Diet
Tracker within the MyFitnessPalTMmobile application ( https://www.my ﬁtnesspal.com ),
in which participants selected their physical activity from an auto-populated list of com-mon activities (e.g. jogging, swimming) and recorded the total minutes a given activitywas performed. There was no standardisation process for goal-review as this aspect of
self-regulation was completed by the study staff, such that, the staff would review real-
time heart rate data via the Zephyr portal or the self-reported physical activity withinthe MyFitnessPal
TMapp. In circumstances where heart rate data could not be transmit-
ted to the web portal due to limited connectivity ( ≈62% of all observations), goal
attainment was determined from the participant ’s self-reported physical activity, as
described below.
Participants were provided daily feedback using four randomly-assigned conditions.
On intervention days, each participant received feedback via one standardised text mes-
sage from either a behavioural health specialist (study staff), a parent (family), or a
peer. On control days, no feedback text message was received, but the participantretained access to the MyFitnessPal
TMmobile application (i.e. active control). Randomi-
sation of conditions occurred across study days within each participant receiving a Latinsquare design to diminish order effects (Brooks,
2012 ). The number of intervention
days was held constant across participants to ensure an equal ‘dose’of each level of the
intervention (6 days of each intervention level). The power analysis ( G* power pro-
gramme) indicated that four groups with six observations each would result in a signi ﬁ-
cant ﬁnding 91% of the time if a small effect (i.e. f= .25) was present in the
population. Therefore, adolescents participated in the study for a total of 24 days. Thestandardised text message was delivered to the participant based on their goal attain-ment for that day. Each night between 7 and 8 pm, the feedback message was sent bystudy staff to the designated feedback provider for that day. Speci ﬁcally, if the partici-
pant met their physical activity goal for the day, the feedback provider was instructedto send the following message: ‘Hey [Insert name]. Great job meeting your physical
activity goal for the day. Keep up the great work. ’However, if the participant did not
meet their physical activity goal, the feedback provider was instructed to send: ‘It looks
like you didn ’t meet your goal for the day. Try going for a short walk to get that heart
rate up. ’It was expected that the feedback provided would modify physical activity on
the following day. On average, participants met their physical activity goal 25% of thetime.
Statistical analysis
Treatment days were lagged by one day to account for expected carryover effects. To
determine for whom the feedback conditions worked, one-day lagged mean MVPA andminutes engaged in sedentary activity were compared between the no-feedback controlPsychology & Health 705
condition and each feedback condition. This allowed for understanding of whether feed-
back from any one individual was greater than not receiving feedback on goal attain-ment. The multi-level structure of the data resulting from the nesting of repeatedoccasions within participants was collapsed using ﬁxed effects to account for all indi-
vidual differences in the average amount of MVPA and sedentary time, as well as indi-
vidual differences in average MVPA and sedentary time between each treatmentcondition and control condition (Hoffman,
2015 ). That is, we estimated an individual
ﬁxed effect for each participant via indicator coding (aka, dummy coding) as well as a
treatment-by-participant ﬁxed interaction effect. All models were estimated using SAS
v. 9.4 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC) using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation;denominator degrees of freedom were estimated using the Satterthwaite method. Thesigniﬁcance of additional variance components were evaluated using likelihood ratio
tests (i.e. −2ΔLL), with degrees of freedom equal to the number of new variance com-
ponents, whereas the signi ﬁcance of ﬁxed effects were evaluated with individual Wald
tests (i.e. estimate/SE). Given the novelty of these feedback conditions, no adjustmentwas employed for multiple comparisons; therefore, p< .05 indicated statistical signi ﬁ-
cance.
Results
For both MVPA and sedentary behaviour, estimating heterogeneous residual variances,
signiﬁcantly improved model ﬁt,−2ΔLL(9) = 20.93, p= .013 and −2ΔLL(9) = 22.85,
p= .007, respectively. As such, for both outcomes, each participant was allowed to
have his or her own residual error variance estimate. The ﬁnal models for MVPA and
sedentary behaviour were based on 157 and 158 observations, respectively.
Idiographic ﬁndings: MVPA
A statistically signi ﬁcant participant-by-feedback condition interaction effect was
observed for MVPA, F(27,5.17) = 18.07, p= .002, indicating the effect of a given feed-
back condition on MVPA varied between participants. Model estimated means and stan-dard errors for MVPA for each participant by feedback condition are presented inTable
1.
Three participants demonstrated signi ﬁcant increases in MVPA when receiving feed-
back compared to not receiving feedback on goal attainment. Speci ﬁcally, participant 1
increased their MVPA relative to the control condition following feedback from the
behavioural health specialist by an average of 26.0 min (95% CI = 7.7 to 44.3). Partici-
pant 5 increased their MVPA relative to the control condition following feedback froma parent and behavioural health specialist, by an average of 83.5 min (95% CI = 70.1 to96.9) and 73.5 min (95% CI = 60.1 to 86.9), respectively. Lastly, relative to the controlcondition, participant 8 averaged a 52.5 min increase in MVPA following parental feed-back (95% CI = 18.5 to 86.5) and a 42.0 min increase following peer feedback (95%CI = .3 to 83.7). The results suggest that some adolescents respond to feedback on goalattainment to increase physical activity, however, a single intervention approach is not
likely to be effectively for helping adolescents increase physical activity.706 E.E. Brannon et al.
Idiographic ﬁndings: minutes engaged in sedentary behaviour
For sedentary behaviour, the participant-by-treatment condition interaction was not sta-
tistically signi ﬁcant, F(27, 10.8) = 2.05, p= .107, indicating that the feedback condi-
tions had a similar effect across participants. After removing this non-signi ﬁcant two-
way interaction effect, the main effect of feedback condition was not statistically signi ﬁ-
cant, F(3, 74.7) = 1.28, p= .288, indicating that no feedback condition signi ﬁcantly
decreased sedentary time relative to the control condition. The average minutes engaged
in sedentary behaviour across the conditions was 609.4 (17.8), 646.4 (18.3) and 651.0
(17.6) for the parent, peer and behavioural health conditions, respectively. Similarly,participants engaged in 642.2 (18.2) minutes of sedentary time during the controlconditions. Relative to control, the parental feedback condition was associated withapproximately 32.8 fewer minutes of sedentary behaviour (95% CI = −80.9–15.4),
whereas the peer and behavioural health specialist feedback conditions averaged slightincreases in sedentary time by 4.3 min (95% CI = −44.9–53.4) and 8.8 min (95%
CI =−39.1–56.7), respectively. Overall, receiving feedback on goal attainment does not
appear to signi ﬁcantly decrease engagement in sedentary behaviour.
Discussion
The purpose of the study was to test the importance of tailored feedback on physical
activity goal attainment from three varying sources. Secondly, this was a preliminarystudy to demonstrate the potential utility and value of N-of-1 RCT designs to identifyactive ingredients in intervention packages. Three participants in the study demonstrated
an increase in physical activity when receiving feedback on goal attainment. Of note,
each participant also responded differently to the feedback providers, with one partici-pant responding favourably to only one feedback provider (i.e. behavioural health spe-cialist) and two participants responding to multiple feedback providers (i.e. parent,behavioural health specialist, peer). Given the within-person variability that exist in life-style behaviours, there is no surprise that the variant of feedback would differ acrossTable 1. Estimated mean MVPA (SE) in minutes for each feedback condition between and within
participants.

participants. As the literature highlights, feedback from all three providers has been
effective in modifying health behaviours (e.g. Fitzgerald et al., 2012 ; Patrick et al.,
2006 ; Van der Horst et al., 2007 ). The idiographic ﬁndings across participants high-
lights the differences in relationships with each feedback provider, in that, some partici-
pants may have responded to the authority of an unknown behavioural health specialist,
while other participants may have operated on more social desirability to impress apeer. At the same time, parents spend a great deal of time with their children and mayhave provided more prompting or encouragement to complete their physical activitywithin the context of the home. Unfortunately, there was no individual treatment effecton decreasing engagement in sedentary behaviour across participants.
As the ﬁeld of health psychology moves towards more adaptive interventions, waste
can be reduced by tailoring the intervention to the needs of the individual to optimise
the treatment effect. In fact, behavioural scientists are often challenged with the task to
answer important questions that often have insuf ﬁcient empirical evidence to guide the
intervention. Our study answers a call in the literature to identify treatment variablesthat may impact intervention effectiveness such as who should be providing feedback ,
and could act as a tailoring variable to indicate how to further individualise treatment.Theﬁeld is only beginning to capitalise on the use of N-of-1 studies to elucidate the
within person variability that affects intervention effectiveness, but also informs theintensity, modality and method of interventions for personalisation treatment (Hobbs
et al.,
2013 ; Nyman et al., 2016 ; Sniehotta et al., 2012 ). The focus on empirically test-
ing individual treatment components may produce more uniform treatment. Therefore,patients ’response to treatment from feedback provider at the initial stage could be used
to assist in randomisation of patients at the second stage of an adaptive intervention.Feedback on goal attainment from a parent, peer or healthcare provider could be con-sidered as a tailoring variable as is demonstrated in the current study. Findings from thisstudy mirror that of the adult literature in identifying the effectiveness of self-regulationcomponents in changing physical activity behaviour (Nyman et al.,
2016 ). Our ﬁndings
are also consistent with literature highlighting the improvements in physical activity
when tailored feedback is provided (Bauer, de Niet, Timman, & Kordy, 2010 ; Fjeldsoe,
Marshall, & Miller, 2009 ; Suggs, 2006 ). Unfortunately there is a paucity of research
utilising N-of-1 designs in child and adolescent samples, which could strengthen theeffectiveness of interventions.
Future studies should involve larger samples, which would provide statistical power to
allow examination of the question of why the intervention works for some participants
and not others (Cushing, Walters, & Hoffman,
2014 ), and by incorporating additional
moderators or mediators of intervention effectiveness. Further examination of psychologi-
cal and cognitive constructs such as self-ef ﬁcacy, readiness and motivation for physical
activity, in addition to perception of social support is warranted (Brown, Hume, Pearson,& Salmon,
2013 ). Understanding those factors that in ﬂuence intervention effectiveness
and elucidate what makes intervention components favourable to each individual is vitalin understanding tailoring variables that can be incorporated into adaptive interventions.Future iterations should also examine the bene ﬁt of an automated text message system
designed to provide appropriate goal-setting and feedback on goal attainment, or a text
message intervention that incorporates social support from family and peers.
Theﬁndings should be interpreted in light of several limitations. Due to the nature
of N-of-1 RCTs and dependence on participant engagement, there was a large amount708 E.E. Brannon et al.
of missing data for some participants. Despite the missing data, the results of this pre-
liminary study are suggestive of an effect for tailored feedback on goal attainment andwarrant replication. A manipulation check was put in place to assess whether the partic-ipants were receiving the text messages from parents and peers as indicated in the pro-
tocol. Due to the logistics of data collection, the manipulation check was completed
prior to the participant receiving the feedback. Future studies should incorporate amanipulation check that not only assesses whether text messages were sent, but alsowhether the content of the message was standardised. The socio-economic status of thefamilies was primarily middle class which may decrease the generalisability to lowersocio-economic status families.
While every effort was made to hold extraneous variables constant, we do not have
knowledge about changes that may have occurred as a result of participating in the
study. For example, it may be that participants had a global shift in their social ecologi-
cal ecosystem in that individuals (e.g. parents, peers) provided general social supportfor physical activity even when they were not instructed to do so. Or, it may be that theapp, which was designed to be an attention control, may have created a change due tothe inclusion of evidence-based strategies. Comparing the data from the current studywith a control group receiving no intervention could provide additional clarity on thesequestions. Mobile health technologies that incorporate the use of text messages stand tobe a viable option for health promotion interventions (Fjeldsoe et al.,
2009 ), speci ﬁcally
physical activity interventions (Bauer et al., 2010 ; Stephens & Allen, 2013 ).
The strengths of this study are two-fold: utilising a novel research methodology to
capitalise on individual variability, and the reliance on an evidence-based behaviourchange model (Carver & Scheier,
1982 ) that lends itself to mobile application. Addi-
tionally, this study highlights the need to take individual preference into account whendesigning interventions and demonstrates the heterogeneity that exist in patient prefer-ence and subsequent impact on intervention effectiveness. Finally, the study addressescalls in the literature to examine individual and temporal factors, tested separately from
a complex intervention, to identify the features that lead to long-term success of beha-
viour change (McDonald, Araújo-Soares, & Sniehotta,
2016 ).
