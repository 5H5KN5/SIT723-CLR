Abstract
Background: Over 60 implementation frameworks exist. Using multiple frameworks may help researchers to
address multiple study purposes, levels, and degrees of theoretical heritage and operationalizability; however, using
multiple frameworks may result in unnecessary complexity and redundancy if doing so does not address study
needs. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Theoretical Domains Framework
(TDF) are both well-operationalized, multi-level implementation determinant frameworks derived from theory. As
such, the rationale for using the frameworks in combination (i.e., CFIR + TDF) is unclear. The objective of this
systematic review was to elucidate the rationale for using CFIR + TDF by (1) describing studies that have used CFIR
+ TDF, (2) how they used CFIR + TDF, and (2) their stated rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
Methods: We undertook a systematic review to identify studies that mentioned both the CFIR and the TDF, were
written in English, were peer-reviewed, and reported either a protocol or results of an empirical study in MEDLINE/
PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, or Google Scholar. We then abstracted data into a matrix and analyzed it
qualitatively, identifying salient themes.
Findings: We identified five protocols and seven completed studies that used CFIR + TDF. CFIR + TDF was applied
to studies in several countries, to a range of healthcare interventions, and at multiple intervention phases; used
many designs, methods, and units of analysis; and assessed a variety of outcomes. Three studies indicated that
using CFIR + TDF addressed multiple study purposes. Six studies indicated that using CFIR + TDF addressed multiple
conceptual levels. Four studies did not explicitly state their rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
Conclusions: Differences in the purposes that authors of the CFIR (e.g., comprehensive set of implementation
determinants) and the TDF (e.g., intervention development) propose help to justify the use of CFIR + TDF. Given
that the CFIR and the TDF are both multi-level frameworks, the rationale that using CFIR + TDF is needed to address
multiple conceptual levels may reflect potentially misleading conventional wisdom. On the other hand, using
CFIR + TDF may more fully define the multi-level nature of implementation. To avoid concerns about unnecessary
complexity and redundancy, scholars who use CFIR + TDF and combinations of other frameworks should specify
how the frameworks contribute to their study.

Background
Scholars seeking to study innovation implementation in
healthcare have over 60 conceptual frameworks to guide
their work [1]. Frameworks can guide implementation,
facilitate the identification of determinants of implemen-
tation, guide the selection of implementation strategies,
and inform all phases of research by helping to frame
study questions and hypotheses, anchor background
literature, clarify constructs to be measured, depict rela-
tionships to be tested, and contextualize results [2, 3].
Frameworks provide a common language, allowing for
cumulative evidence to develop.
Implementation frameworks may differ from one an-
other in a number of ways. First, they may serve differ-
ent purposes : to describe/guide the implementation
process as a whole (e.g., the Knowledge to Action frame-
work [4]), to identify determinants of implementation
(e.g., the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research (CFIR [5]), the Theoretical Domains Frame-
work (TDF [6])), or to evaluate implementation (e.g.,
Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Mainten-
ance [7]). Second, implementation frameworks differ in
the conceptual level at which they focus, with some
focused on a single level (e.g., organizational, team, indi-
vidual) and others being multi-level [1, 8]. Third, they
differ in their degree of theoretical heritage , ranging from
emergent, context-specific conceptual frameworks to
theoretical frameworks that describe and/or combine ex-
planations derived from multiple evidence-based theor-
ies (e.g., the exploration, adoption decision/preparation,
active implementation, sustainment framework). Fourth,
they may differ in their degree of operationalizability ,
with some including definitions, tools, and suggested
methodological approaches to facilitate use and promote
consistent application [1]. For example, the CFIR has an
online technical assistance website (www.cfirguide.org)
with sample interview questions that tap included specific
constructs, and Michie et al. (2005), which introduces the
TDF, contains sample interview questions for each TDF
domain as well as a recently developed quantitative ques-
tionnaire [6, 9]. Atkins et al. have a manual for TDF appli-
cation currently under review for publication (personal
communication, Lou Atkins, November 15, 2016).
A key challenge for researchers and practitioners is
how to select from among the growing number of
frameworks [10]. In many cases, a single framework can
be used to address study needs. In some cases, scholarsmay use multiple frameworks because a single frame-
work cannot comprehensively address study needs.
Scholars may need to use multiple frameworks to ad-
dress multiple study purposes (e.g., to identify determi-
nants and inform evaluation) or conceptual levels (i.e.,
multi-level studies), to account for multiple theoretical
perspectives , or to adequately operationalize key con-
cepts. In contrast, if a single framework is sufficient for
addressing study needs, using multiple frameworks may
threaten the scientific principle of parsimony, potentially
resulting in unnecessary complexity and redundancy,
particularly if each included framework does not con-
tribute some unique content (e.g., purpose, conceptual
level, theoretical perspective, operationalization).
To avoid concerns that using multiple frameworks
introduces unnecessary complexity and redundancy,
scholars should provide a clear rationale for using mul-
tiple frameworks. Analyzing studies that use both the
CFIR and the TDF (hereafter, CFIR + TDF ) may be
instructive for understanding scholars ’rationales for
using multiple frameworks because of these frameworks ’
apparent similarities: The CFIR and the TDF are both
well-operationalized, multi-level implementation deter-
minant frameworks derived from theory. The CFIR
includes 39 constructs (i.e., discrete theoretical concepts)
arranged across five domains (i.e., groups of conceptually
related constructs), emphasizing determinants of imple-
mentation that may be active primarily, though not
exclusively, at the collective (e.g., organization) level.
Domains include intervention characteristics (e.g., adapt-
ability), outer setting (e.g., patient needs and resources),
inner setting (e.g., culture), and process (e.g., planning).
One domain, characteristics of individuals, focuses on
individual-level constructs (e.g., self-efficacy). The CFIR
has been applied to a diverse array of studies that have
investigated mental health workers ’views of a health
self-management program, identified determinants of
successful implementation of evidence-based practices
in public health agencies, designed a tailored interven-
tion strategy to improve hospital services for children,
and evaluated success of an implementation trial to
improve uptake of a re-engagement program for patients
with mental illness in Veterans Affairs medical centers,
among others [11].
The TDF is another commonly used implementation
determinant framework that includes 128 constructs
in 12 domains derived from 33 theories of behaviorBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:2 Page 2 of 14
change [6]. The TDF provides a high level of elaboration
for constructs related to individual level change though it
also includes collective (e.g., o rganization) level constructs
[12]. TDF domains include knowledge (e.g., of scientific
rationale for implementation); skills (e.g., ability); social/
professional role and identity (e.g., group norms); beliefs
about capabilities (e.g., self-efficacy); beliefs about conse-
quences (e.g., outcome expecta ncies); motivation and goals
(e.g., intention); memory, attention, and decision processes
(e.g., attention control); environmental context and re-
sources (e.g., resources); social influences (e.g., leadership);
emotion (e.g., burnout); behavi oral regulation (e.g., feed-
back); and nature of the behavior (e.g., routine). The TDF
has also been applied in numerous studies, including
process evaluation of a Canadian CT head rule trial, a
qualitative study of factors inf luencing mild traumatic brain
injury in the emergency department, barriers and faci-
litators of interventions to engage pregnant women in
smoking cessation, and investigation of perceptions about
pre-operative testing in low-risk patients [13 –16].
We are aware of (and, in the case of BP , FL, NG, and JF,
have authored) studies that have used CFIR + TDF; how-
ever, given the apparent similarities between the CFIR and
the TDF in terms of purpose, level, degree of theoretical
heritage, and operationalizability, the rationale for using
CFIR + TDF is not readily apparent. The objective of this
study is to elucidate the rationale for using CFIR + TDF.
To achieve this objective, we describe (1) published
studies that have used CFIR + TDF, (2) how they used
CFIR + TDF (e.g., to address multiple study purposes or
conceptual levels), and (3) their stated rationale for using
CFIR + TDF. In fulfilling this objective, we aim to inform
the judicious use of CFIR + TDF and combinations of
other frameworks in future implementation studies. When
necessary, using multiple frameworks to address study
needs may help to limit the proliferation of frameworks
and the related fragmentation of knowledge by ensuring
that existing frameworks continue to be used, evaluated,
and refined and by avoiding segmentation of the field
through the use of a single preferred framework over an-
other [1, 17, 18]. Using multiple frameworks may curtail
“pseudoinnovation, ”wherein perceived advances in fra-
mework development are more aptly characterized as
reinvention rather than true innovation [18]. In addition,
studies that use multiple frameworks may yield more prac-
tically relevant results, part icularly if the frameworks se-
lected can help to conceptualize implementation at multiple
levels [8, 19]. Perhaps equally important, the use of multiple
frameworks may represent an opportunity to move imple-
mentation science toward greater interdisciplinarity.
Methods
Our systematic review was conducted in accordance with
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and checklist (Add-
itional file 1), using the accompanying explanation and elab-
oration document. The review protocol was registered with
the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO) on November 3, 2015 and updated on De-
cember 12, 2016 (registration number CRD42015027615).
Search strategy
To identify studies that used CFIR + TDF, we searched
for published articles that referred to both the “Consoli-
dated Framework for Implementation Research ”(or
“CFIR ”) and the “Theoretical Domains Framework ”(or
“TDF ”) in the full text in the following databases: MED-
LINE/PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Google
Scholar. The TDF was published in the 2005 article
“Making psychological theory useful for implementing
evidence based practice: a consensus approach ”(Michie
et al. 2005 [6]), but it was not named as the Theoretical
Domains Framework until 2012 [12]. To capture records
that used the CFIR and referenced Michie et al. (2005)
[6], possibly representing the use of both the CFIR and
the TDF before it was named as such, we also searched
PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for re-
cords that referred to both the “Consolidated Framework
for Implementation Research ”(or “CFIR ”) and “Making
psychological theory useful for implementing evidence
based practice: a consensus approach [6]. ”(We did not
search PubMed because it does not search references.)
We conducted these searches first in December 2015
and again in October 2016.
Inclusion criteria
To be included in the study, records were required to
mention both the CFIR and the TDF, be written in the
English language and peer-reviewed, and report either a
protocol for or results of an empirical study.
Study selection process
SB, AK, and YY selected records for inclusion in the
study. These authors conducted title, abstract, and full-
text review, searching for evidence of CFIR + TDF use.
Discrepancies were resolved through discussions be-
tween the three authors and, when necessary, BP until
consensus was reached. During this process, 65 records
were excluded because they did not report empirical
research, were not published in English, or did not use
both frameworks. SB and either AK or YY then reviewed
full text of the remaining 12 records, confirming evi-
dence of CFIR + TDF use in each record.
Data extraction and analysis
Given our a priori interest in understanding why and how
CFIR + TDF has been used, we used a framework analysis
approach [20]. In general, the framework analysis approachBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:2 Page 3 of 14
allows researchers to analyze qualitative data in a matrix
format (i.e., Excel workbook) consisting of rows (cases),
columns (codes), and cells (summarized data [21]). We
adopted a framework analysis approach that included five
key phases: familiarization, identifying a thematic frame-
work, indexing, charting, and mapping and interpretation.
First, in the familiarization phase, we reviewed included
studies and familiarized ourselves with the literature base.
Second, we identified a thematic framework based on our
specific research objectives. This thematic framework
served as the columns (codes) for data abstraction. To
describe studies to which researchers have applied CFIR +
TDF, our thematic framework included study objective,
design, setting, unit of analysis, and outcomes assessed.
Consistent with our study objectives, our thematic frame-
work also included authors ’stated rationale for using CFIR
+ TDF and how CFIR + TDF was used (i.e., explicit ration-
ale for using CFIR + TDF, specifically, related to one or
more of the dimensions listed in Table 2 or another di-
mension that authors identified as a rationale for using
CFIR + TDF). Next, in the indexing and charting phases,
we abstracted text selections from included articles and
placed them into the appropriate cells within our frame-
work. Indexing and charting of all included articles was
completed by two authors (SB, AK). All discrepancies in
the indexing and charting ph ase were discussed until
consensus was reached. Finally, in the mapping and in-
terpretation phase, summarized data from each cell wereanalyzed to address each research question ((1) what stud-
ies have used CFIR + TDF, (2) how they used CFIR + TDF
(e.g., framing, data collection, analysis), and (3) their stated
rationale for using CFIR + TDF). Themes related to each
research question were discussed among SB, BP , and AK
until consensus was reached.
Results
Our search yielded 95 publications. We removed 18 dupli-
cates, leaving 77 for screening; of these, we excluded 65
publications because they did not mention both the CFIR
and the TDF, were not written in English, or did not
report a protocol or results of empirical studies (see Fig. 1).
We identified 12 CFIR + TDF articles; the final list of
included studies comprised five protocols for empirical
studies (Gould [22], Prior [23], Manca [24], Graham-Rowe
[25], Sales [26]) and seven completed empirical studies
(Murphy [27], English [28], Bunger [29], Moullin [30],
Newlands [31], Templeton [32], Elouafkaoui [33]).

Objective
All studies ’objectives were related to interventions to im-
prove health care. Two completed studies and two proto-
cols described intervention d esign and/or implementation
plans (Gould [22], Sales [26], Murphy [27], English [28]);
one protocol described a comparison of the effectiveness of
an intervention relative to standard care (Prior [23]), and
two protocols and five completed studies evaluated inter-
ventions (Manca [24], Sales [ 26], Bunger [29], Moullin [30],
Newlands [31], Templeton [32], Elouafkaoui [33]).
Several of the included studies had multiple objectives
(e.g., effectiveness study and concurrent qualitative
process evaluation [23, 33]).
Setting
All study settings were healthcare organizations. Two
were hospitals (Gould [22], English [28]). Other settings
included pharmacy, dentistry, primary care, and behavioral
health agencies. Studies were conducted in Australia (1),
Canada (2), England (1), Kenya (1), Scotland (4), and
the USA (2).
Intervention phase
In the included studies, CFIR + TDF was applied
across all phases of an intervention (i.e., design, feasi-
bility/piloting, implementation, and evaluation; see
Table 1). Two completed studies and two protocols
(Gould [22], Sales [26], Murphy [27], English [28])
used the frameworks in the intervention design phase.
One of these protocols (Gould [22]) also planned to
apply CFIR + TDF in the feasibility/piloting phase to
identify current practice of healthcare professionals
within the intervention target healthcare setting and
identify barriers and facilitators to performing the
target behavior. The other protocol (Sales [26]) also
planned to apply CFIR + TDF in the implementation
phase. Another protocol (Prior [23]) was focused only
on the implementation phase, proposing to use CFIR
+ TDF to assess acceptability of the intervention and
identify barriers and facilitators to the intervention
target behavior. Ostensibly, protocols may yield future
intervention development papers and results papers
that apply CFIR + TDF to additional intervention
phases. Five completed studies and two protocols
applied CFIR + TDF to the intervention evaluation
phase (Manca [24], Graham-Rowe [25], Bunger [29],
Moullin [30], Newlands [31], Templeton [32]).
Design
Nine of the 12 completed studies and protocols had obser-
vational designs; one protocol and one completed study
were randomized controlled trials that incorporated a
process evaluation (Prior [23], Elouafkaoui [33]). One
protocol was a systematic review (Graham-Rowe [25]).Methods
Two studies ’(Murphy [27], English [28]) sole objective
was intervention design, using environmental scans, a
priori knowledge about context, and a theory-informed
approach. One study was quantitative (Bunger [29]), and
two completed studies and four protocols were mixed-
method (Gould [22], Prior [23], Manca [24], Sales [26],
Templeton [32], Elouafkaoui [33]) including interviews,
questionnaires, observation, comparative effectiveness,
framework analysis, and network analysis. (Note that
Gould et al. used CFIR + TDF in only one of their
three sub-studies in which only qualitative (interview
and observation) methods were used [22].) Two stud-
ies were qualitative (Moullin [30], Newlands [31]),
and one protocol was a systematic literature review
(Graham-Rowe [25]).
Data collection
Two completed studies (Murphy [27], English [28])
designed interventions; their data sources included
results from authors ’previous and ongoing research
(Murphy [27], English [28]), the published literature
(Murphy [27], English [28]), authors ’cumulative tacit
knowledge and experience (Murphy [27], English [28]),
and informal discussions with stakeholders (English
[28]); notably, both intervention development studies ’
authors described CFIR + TDF as data sources. A third
completed study (Bunger [29]) applied neither the CFIR
nor the TDF during data collection. One protocol
(Manca [24]) and one completed study (Moullin [30])
planned to collect qualitative interview data but did not
state how CFIR + TDF would be used during data collec-
tion. Three protocols and two completed studies (Gould
[22], Prior [23], Sales [26], Newlands [31], Elouafkaoui
[33]) developed or planned to develop (Sales [26])
interview topic guides using CFIR + TDF, and one com-
pleted study developed a provider questionnaire using
CFIR + TDF (Templeton [32]); however, none fully spe-
cified which constructs or domains would be used or
how constructs or domains would be selected. One
protocol, the systematic review (Graham-Rowe [25])
indicated that the authors would include some terms
related to TDF domains in their search strategy, but they
did not specify TDF domains.
Data analysis
Two completed intervention studies (Murphy [27],
English [28]) indicated that they used CFIR + TDF not
explicitly for data analysis but rather to promote their
intervention ’s implementation. English et al. indicated
that they primarily used CFIR ’s intervention domain,
considering its constructs in the design and packaging of
their intervention; they identified the TDF ’s skills, social/
professional role identity, reinforcement, goal, and socialBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:2 Page 8 of 14
influence constructs as particularly relevant for inform-
ing the design of their intervention [28]. Murphy et al.
used CFIR + TDF to “consciously give priority to the
process of implementation within the design of the
intervention ”[ 2 7 ] .S p e c i f i c a l l y ,t h eC F I Ro f f e r e dt h e m
a“meta-view ”of constructs to consider that were
relevant to the implementation of their intervention.
How Murphy et al. used the TDF in data analysis was
less clear, although the authors indicated that they
considered the TDF during their assessment of phar-
macists ’capability, opportunity, motivation, and be-
havior (COM-B) related to the intervention [27].
Two protocols (Gould [22], Prior [23]) and one com-
pleted study (Elouafkaoui [33]) were explicit in stating
that CFIR + TDF would be (Gould [22])/was (Prior [23],
Elouafkaoui [33]) used to code interview data, but none
of these identified specific constructs or domains from
each framework that would be used for analysis. Two
studies used the TDF (not CFIR) to code interview data
(Newlands [31], Templeton [32]). Moullin et al. used an
adapted version of the CFIR, augmented with elements of
the TDF, in a secondary analysis of interview data [30].
Graham-Rowe et al. planned to use all domains of CFIR +
TDF to code data abstracted from their systematic review
of existing literature [25]. Bunger et al. stated that CFIR +
TDF provided theoretical just ification for components of
the learning collaborative inte rvention that they described,
identifying specific constructs and domains from each
framework that related to intervention components [29].
As with their explanation of how CFIR + TDF would in-

data analysis (Manca [24], Sales [26]).
Unit of analysis
One protocol ’s and one completed study ’s units of analysis
were the individual (Manca [24], Newlands [31]), and two
protocols ’and one completed study ’s units of analysis
were the organization (Gould [22], Prior [23], Elouafkaoui
[33]). Three completed studies and two protocols ana-
lyzed data at both individual and organizational levels
(Graham-Rowe [25], Sales [26], Bunger [29], Moullin
[30], Templeton [32]). As noted above, two completed
studies ’sole objective was intervention design; although
the intervention was targeted at healthcare professionals,
environmental scan efforts were conducted in both stud-
ies, focusing on the societal, organizational, and individual
levels (Murphy [27], English [28]). Five studies (Gould
[22], Prior [23], Murphy [27], Templeton [32], Elouafkaoui
[33]) and two protocols (Graham-Rowe [25], Sales [26])
referred to CFIR + TDF ’s ability to tap the multiple levels
at which implementation determinants lie, generally
suggesting that the TDF tapped individual levels and the
CFIR tapped collective levels.Outcomes assessed. In contrast to other study charac-
teristics, we only report outcomes assessed for study
objectives that used CFIR + TDF. One completed study
assessed healthcare professionals ’behavior (i.e., engage-
ment in professional networks (Bunger [29]); two proto-
cols assessed specific beliefs relating to a behavior (e.g.,
response to feedback from blood transfusion audit and
feedback; Gould [22], Prior [23]); two protocols assessed
intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementa-
tion, and maintenance (Manca [24], Sales [26]); and
three protocols and three studies assessed determinants
of implementation (e.g., acceptability of the intervention;
Gould [22], Prior [23], Moullin [30], Newlands [31],
Templeton [32]). One study assessed the role and
importance of CFIR + TDF domains (Graham-Rowe
[25]). Two completed studies did not assess outcomes,
as their sole objective was intervention design (Murphy
[27], English [28]).
Stated rationale for using CFIR + TDF
Table 2 excerpts studies ’descriptions of their use of
CFIR + TDF and, in most cases, their stated rationale for
using CFIR + TDF; four studies did not explicitly state
their rationale for using CFIR + TDF (English [28],
Bunger [29], Newlands [31], Elouafkaoui [33]).
Of the eight studies that explicitly stated their ration-
ale for using CFIR + TDF, three indicated that the CFIR
and the TDF addressed different purposes (Prior [23],
Manca [24], Murphy [27]). In each of the three studies,
the authors described one framework as offering an
overarching perspective on implementation determi-
nants and the other as more conducive to translating
findings into practical approaches to implementation.
Interestingly, two of these studies (Prior [23] and Mur-
phy [27]) described the CFIR as offering an overarching
perspective on implementation determinants and the
TDF as offering specific determinants of healthcare pro-
viders ’behavior, whereas the third study (Manca [24])
offered the opposite rationale, citing the TDF as includ-
ing “all of the important constructs of implementation ”
and the CFIR as a framework that would assist in “iden-
tifying key elements in the program implementation in a
systematic way. ”
Six of the included studies that explicitly stated their
rationale for using CFIR + TDF indicated that the CFIR
and the TDF addressed different conceptual levels
(Gould [22], Prior [23], Graham-Rowe [25], Sales [26],
Moullin [30], Templeton [32]). In each of the studies
that cited multiple conceptual levels as their rationale
for using CFIR + TDF, authors suggested that the CFIR
addressed the collective level and the TDF addressed
the individual level. For example, Sales et al. wrote
“Our primary rationale for using both frameworks is
that one (TDF) specializes in individual-level behaviorBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:2 Page 9 of 14

Discussion
The objective of this study was to elucidate scholars ’
rationale for using CFIR + TDF by describing (1) studies
that have used CFIR + TDF; (2) how they used CFIR +
TDF (e.g., framing, data collection, analysis); and (3)
their stated rationale for using CFIR + TDF. CFIR + TDF
was applied to studies in several countries, of a range of
healthcare interventions and at multiple intervention
phases. In particular, several of the included studies used
CFIR + TDF to describe context by assessing characteris-
tics of individuals and of the organization within which
they were embedded. They then used this information to
design tailored strategies for implementing an evidence-
based practice. This reflects the generally held belief that
tailoring strategies to context will lead to more effective
implementation [34 –36]. CFIR + TDF was also appliedto studies with a variety of designs and methods, with
multiple units of analysis and outcomes assessed.
Eight of the 12 studies included in our analysis expli-
citly stated a rationale for using CFIR + TDF. Three
studies (Prior [23], Manca [24], Murphy [27]) suggested
that the CFIR and the TDF addressed multiple study
purposes . Authors of both the CFIR and the TDF
describe the respective frameworks as a set of determi-
nants to facilitate understanding implementation. In
addition, Damschroder et al. suggested that the CFIR
was intended to promote theory development and facili-
tate synthesis of research findings across studies and
contexts [5], and Michie et al. suggested that the TDF
may be used to promote the development of interven-
tions to enhance implementation [6].
Differences in the purposes that authors of the CFIR
and the TDF propose help to justify the rationale that
these frameworks address multiple study purposes .
Murphy et al. suggested that as a comprehensive frame-
work, the CFIR provided a “meta-view ”of implementa-
tion, whereas the TDF helped to conceptualize behavior
change interventions [27]. Prior et al. similarly conceivedTable 2 Studies ’rationale for using CFIR + TDF (Continued)

Newlands et al. [ 31] “Section 1 of the interview related to participants ’
experiences and responses to the RAPiD trial audit
and feedback intervention and were based on
the…[CFIR]. Section 2 of the interview used a topic
guide based on the TDF to explore the factors
influencing GDPs ’management of patients with
bacterial infections. ”(p. 2)No stated rationale
Prior et al. [ 23] “[U]sing the [CFIR] to explore the acceptability of
theinterventions and the [TDF] to identify barriers
and enablers to evidence-based antibiotic prescribing
behaviour by GDPs …[The TDF] allows for consideration
of a comprehensive range of potential influences on
health professional behavior …The CFIR consists of
common constructs from published implementation
theories and offers an over-arching typology to
promote implementation theory development and
verification to understand the mechanism about
what works, where, and why across various
contexts. ”(p. 1; p. 7)XX
Sales et al. [ 26] “Our primary rationale for using both frameworks
is that one (TDF) specializes in individual-level
behavior change, while the other (CFIR) focuses
more on the organizational level, above the
individual. ”(p. 3)X
Templeton et al. [ 32] “The [TDF] was used to identify and describe
patient-, organization-, and system-level barriers
and facilitators to care …[Practice characteristics]
were selected using the [CFIR] as a complement
to the TDF to increase specificity of organizational
assessment. ”(p. 1)X

of the CFIR as an “over-arching typology ”for under-
standing implementation and the TDF as a lens for
understanding provider behavior [23]. Manca et al. viewed
the TDF as a comprehensive framework for understanding
implementation but used the CFIR to inform the imple-
mentation process (a CFIR domain) [24].
Six studies (Gould [22], Prior [23], Graham-Rowe [25],
Sales [26], Moullin [30], Templeton [32]) suggested that
the TDF and the CFIR addressed different conceptual
levels of implementation determinants. Damschroder et
al. characterized the CFIR as a “comprehensive tax-
onomy of specific constructs related to the intervention,
inner and outer setting, individuals, and implementation
process ”[5]. The TDF also includes constructs at mul-
tiple levels, including the individual and collective [6].
Given that the CFIR and the TDF both include determi-
nants at both the individual and collective levels, the
dichotomy that these six studies suggest may reflect
potentially misleading conventional wisdom. To the
extent that the CFIR and the TDF each sufficiently
address constructs at the individual and collective levels,
studies that use CFIR + TDF to address multiple concep-
tual levels may introduce unnecessary complexity and
redundancy. On the other hand, it is possible that the
CFIR and the TDF, when combined, help to more fully
define the multi-level nature of behavior change in
healthcare organizations than either of these frameworks
alone. Formal efforts to map the CFIR and the TDF onto
one another may help to explicate the extent to which
using CFIR + TDF in fact helps to address multiple
conceptual levels, or if using CFIR + TDF introduces
unnecessary complexity and redundancy.
Four of the studies included in our analyses did not
explicitly state a rationale for using CFIR + TDF; how-
ever, in some cases, how these studies used CFIR +
T D Fo f f e r e di n s i g h ti n t ot h e i ra u t h o r s ’rationales for
doing so. English et al. indicated that they primarily
used the CFIR ’s intervention domain and the TDF ’ss k i l l s ,
social/professional role and identity, reinforcement,
goals, and social influences constructs. The selection
of these domains and constructs may suggest that
English et al., like six other included studies, viewed
the CFIR as a representative of the collective level and
the TDF as a representative of the individual level: The
CFIR ’s intervention domain lies at the collective level,
whereas the TDF constructs that English et al. in-
cluded, such social/professional role and identity lie at
the individual level. Similarly, Newlands et al. used the
CFIR to collect data regarding the intervention (col-
lective level) and the TDF to collect data regarding
provider behavior (individual level), and in Elouafkaoui
et al. ’s [33] description of their unit of analysis, they
suggested that TDF tapped individual levels and the
CFIR tapped collective levels.Our finding that several included studies did not expli-
citly state a rationale for using CFIR + TDF is consistent
with other studies that have found inadequate descrip-
tions and justifications for included frameworks in
empirical studies [11, 37 –39]. This underscores the need
for guidance on how to apply frameworks and report
their use, perhaps signaling the need for specific report-
ing standards such as those developed for implementa-
tion strategies [38, 40].
Implications
In fulfilling our objective of elucidating scholars ’ration-
ale for using CFIR + TDF, we aimed to inform the judi-
cious use of CFIR + TDF and combinations of other
frameworks in future implementation studies. Doing so
may help to limit the proliferation of frameworks and
the related fragmentation of knowledge by ensuring that
existing frameworks continue to be used, evaluated, and
refined and by avoiding segmentation of the field
through use of a single preferred framework over an-
other [1, 17, 18]; curtail “pseudoinnovation, ”wherein
perceived advances in framework development are more
aptly characterized as reinvention rather than true
innovation [18]; yield more practically relevant study re-
sults; and move implementation science toward greater
interdisciplinarity.
We found that eight of the 12 included studies indi-
cated that they used CFIR + TDF to address multiple
study purposes and conceptual levels . Specifically, au-
thors of six included studies suggested that either the
CFIR or the TDF offered an overarching perspective on
implementation determinants, whereas the other was
described as more conducive to translating findings into
practical approaches to implementation. And authors of
six included studies suggested that the CFIR and the
TDF addressed distinct conceptual levels; generally
speaking, these studies argued that the TDF addressed
multiple conceptual levels but did not sufficiently
elaborate on determinants of implementation at the col-
lective level. To avoid concerns regarding unnecessary
complexity or redundancy, scholars who use CFIR +
TDF and combinations of other frameworks as useful
for addressing multiple study needs should explicitly
specify the benefits of each included framework; doing
so will help to justify the use of multiple frameworks,
and it will contribute to our understanding of each
framework, its scope, and its limitations.
Our finding that some included studies did not explicitly
state a rationale for using CFIR + TDF suggests that, at a
minimum, future studies that apply multiple frameworks
should clearly describe the ways in the frameworks, when
combined, contribute to their study; the ways in which
each framework alone is limited in contributing to their
study; how the frameworks ’contributions converge and/orBirken et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:2 Page 12 of 14
diverge; and recommendations for the refinement of
o n eo rm o r ef r a m e w o r k .D o i n gs ow i l ls t r e n g t h e nt h e
studies and contribute generalizable knowledge regarding
the frameworks.
Limitations
A few limitations of this systematic review should be
noted. Although we searched many databases with wide
coverage using clear, specific, and appropriate terms, we
included only peer-reviewed published research in English.
It is possible that the search did not yield all published
studies that used CFIR + TDF. For example, additional
applications may be found in “grey literature ”or in dif-
ferent languages. In addition, our ability to understand
scholars ’rationale for CFIR + TDF was limited to the
extent that they did not explicitly state their rationale;
however, how scholars used CFIR + TDF offered insight
into their rationale. A future study that interviews scholars
regarding their rationale for using CFIR + TDF may
provide additional insight.
Conclusions
T h ef i n d i n g sf r o mt h i sr e v i e wi n d i c a t et h a ti ti sn o t
uncommon for implementation researchers to use
CFIR + TDF to inform their work. As future studies
use CFIR + TDF and combine other frameworks, there is
a need to answer fundamental questions about whether
and how the use of multiple frameworks yields substantial
benefits beyond that of a single framework applied to its
full potential. This review also echoes findings from across
the field of implementation science that the explicit use of
theories and frameworks needs improvement [39]. Given
the lack of guidance in the field, we call for the develop-
ment of practical tools to guide the application of theories
and frameworks as well as corresponding reporting
guidelines. These efforts will help to clarify the applica-
tion and contribution of theories and frameworks in
implementation research and will facilitate richer theor-
etical understanding of implementation determinants,
processes, and outcomes.
