Abstract
Background: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in old age, but they remain mostly untreated. Several
clinical trials have shown promising results in preventing or reducing depressive symptoms. However, it is not clear
how robust these effects are in the real world of day-to-day care. Therefore, we have implemented the ‘Lust for Life ’
programme, which significantly reduced depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults in the first three
months after implementation. This mixed-methods study was conducted alongside the trial to develop a contextualised
understanding of factors affecting the implementation.
Methods: A total of 263 persons of 65 years and older with depr essive symptoms were recruited from 18 general
practices and home care organizations in the Netherlands. We used qualitative data (in-depth interviews and focus group
discussions with participants with dep ressive symptoms and healthcare professionals) as well as quantitative data
(longitudinal data on the severity of depressive symptoms) to explore hindering and facilitating factors to the
implementation of the ‘Lust for Life ’programme.
Results: The uptake of the routine screening was poor and imposed significant burdens on participants and healthcare
professionals, and drop-out r ates were high. Participants ’perceived mental problems and need for care played a key role
in their decision to participate in the p rogramme and to step up to consequent interventions. Older people preferred
interventions that focused on interpersonal contact. The programme was only effective when delivered by mental
healthcare nurses, compared to home care nurses with limited experience in providing mental healthcare.
Conclusions: The intervention programme was effective in reducin g depressive symptoms, and valuable lessons can be
learned from this implementation trial. Given the low uptake and high investment, we advise against routine screening
for depressive symptoms in general healt hcare. Further, agreement between the p articipant and healthcare professional
on perceived need for care and intervention is vital. Rather than providing a stepped care i ntervention programme, we
showed that offering only one single preference-led interventi on is effective. Lastly, since the provision of the interventions
seems to ask for specific skills and experiences, it might re quire mental healthcare nurses to offer the programme.

Background
Depressive disorders are the second leading cause of
disability worldwide [1]. Although many efficaciousinterventions are available, most depressive disorders
remain untreated, particularly in older adults [2,3].
Therefore, several strategies have been proposed to improvedepression management, aimed at treating as well as
preventing onset and recurrence [4].
First, one of those strategies concerns mass screening
in general practice to improve case findings. Screening
aims to detect persons with depressive symptoms at risk
for major depression, or tho se with a depressive disorder
that has remained unrecognised by healthcare professionals.
Second, to improve the provision of effective (preventive)
interventions, stepped care models, and preference-ledcare have been developed. Stepped care aims at making the
best use of available resources by initially offering effective
interventions at the lowest possible intensity ( e.g., guided
self-help), which are advanced to a higher intensity when
needed ( e.g., counselling, medication). Stepped care is
guideline-concordant and is effective in preventing andtreating depressive disorders [5-11]. Treatment initiation
and adherence could further be improved by applying
preference-led care [12], i.e. tailoring treatment to partici-
pants ’needs by providing them in each step with multiple
treatment options to choose from [7,13-15]. Yet, current
randomised clinical trials have compared stepped caremodels to stratified care, and thereby missed participants ’
needs for care.
It is unknown how a preference-led model –integrated
with the provision of stepped care –would impact clinical
effectiveness, or be effective when implemented in routine
primary care. Therefore, we implemented an interventionprogramme (the ‘Lust for Life-programme ’)c o n s i s t i n go f
evidence-based interventions to reduce depressive
symptoms in older adults in primary care and homecare facilities in the Netherlands. This programme
consisted of two key aspects: first, it was outreaching,
i.e., we applied a pro-active case-finding procedure,
and second, both stepped and preference-led care was
provided by offering multiple treatment options in
steps (see Figure 1). The current mixed-method study
was conducted alongside, to develop a contextualised
understanding of factors affecting implementation.
Methods
Study design
The ‘Lust for Life ’programme was implemented in 18
general practices on three different sites (Amsterdam,
West-Friesland and Leiden) in the Netherlands and one
home-care facility located in Amsterdam. These facilitieswere randomised into four clusters following a stepped-
wedge randomised-cluster design [16], see Additional file 1.
A stepped-wedge design is a type of crossover design inwhich the intervention is rolled out sequentially to
participants over a number of time periods. All participants
are recruited at the start of the study and assigned toseveral clusters. Starting moments are determined by
(cluster-) randomisation and by the end of the study,
all participants will have received the intervention.That is, clusters cross over from control to intervention
condition. During the control condition, usual care is
provided. This design was chosen since the offered clinicalinterventions were evidence-based, and it might, therefore,
be unethical to withhold them from a considerable group
of subjects as would occur in a randomised clinicaltrial. Second, staged implementation allowed for the
evaluation, refinement and application of the (renewed)
implementation strategy along the way. The VU UniversityMedical Centre Ethical Review Board approved of the study
(No. 2010/084).
The ‘Lust for Life ’programme
Participants were recruited by proactive case finding to
lower barriers to care utilisation. All enlisted persons of65 years and older (N = 9,661) from participating general
practices and a home care organisation were informed
about the programme and invited to fill out the self-reportPatient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; [17]), which
is a dual-purpose instrument to diagnose a depressive
disorder, as well as monitor depression severity.
Eligible subjects who gave informed consent were
offered three months of watchful waiting, and consequently
invited for an intake session when depressive symptomspersisted (Figure 1). The stepped care programme con-
sisted of preference-led, evidence-based interventions
administered in three steps, if necessary: step 1: choice of1a) a guided self-help course based on Lewinsohn ’s
‘Coping with Depression Course ’[18] or 1b) an exercise
programme [19] delivered in groups of four to six partici-pants three times a week; step 2: choice of 2a) life review (a
structured reminiscence intervention aimed at reducing
late life depressive symptoms) [20] or 2b) Problem SolvingTreatment (PST; structured skills enhancing behavioural
intervention based on the assumption that problems in
daily life cause and maintain depressive symptoms [21]);and step 3: referral to a GP to discuss further treatment
options. Nurses were provided with instructions on how
to refer older people with feelings of loneliness to socialservices, if desirable.
The clinical interventions were offered to participants
with continuous depressive symptoms according tothe cut-off score of six or higher [22] on the PHQ-9.
Patients with a PHQ ≥20 (severe depression) and vital
depression on diagnostic interview (MINI [23]) wereadvised to consult their GP immediately.
The intake session and most of the clinical interventions
were provided by mental health care nurses (to participantsvan Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 2 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/107
recruited in general practices) or by home care nurses
(to participants recruited in general practices or home care).
Geriatric physiotherapists offered the training programme.A psychologist specifically trained nurses on how to
deliver the clinical interventio ns. They attended two-monthly
group supervision meetings and received individualfeedback on at least two tape-recorded sessions of the
step two clinical interventions. Personal supervision
by telephone was provided upon request. A qualifiedpsychologist supervised. Except for the exercise programme
that took place in a gym, interventions were administered
individually at the participants ’homes or in the practice of
the participating GP.
Clinical effectiveness of the programme
Intention-to-treat-analyses showed that the ‘Lust for
Life ’programme had a favourable impact on depression
severity: depressive symptoms s ignificantly declined in the
first three months after impleme ntation of the clinical inter-
ventions compared to their cou rse before implementation
(Wald = 19.636, df = 8, p = 0.012) . Estimated means decre-
mented with 1.5 points on the PHQ-9 from an average of
9.34 (95% CI 8.13 to 10.54) to an average of 7.83 (95% CI
6.83-8.82) [24]. This effect can be compared to a standardmean difference of 0.25 (SD 6.0) or a small effect as used
by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Data collection
Qualitative data collection
The main sources for identifying, facilitating and
hindering factors to the implementation of the ‘Lust
for Life ’programme were qualitative interviews with
different stakeholders at several moments during theimplementation of the intervention programme (see
Figure 2 for more detailed information). Individual inter-
views were conducted with respondents with depressivesymptoms. All cluster-two respondents were invited to
participate in the interviews and were followed up on,
irrespective of their decision to accept or refuse the inter-vention offer and possible drop-out of the interventions,
GPs, physiotherapists and the trainer of the interventions.
Focus group discussions were held with teams of mentalhealthcare and home care nurses.
Since it was impossible to interview non-respondents
or older adults who declined participation, we collecteddata in other ways to capture their views. Information
was used from returned screening forms and telephone
conversations that research staff conducted with elderlyFigure 1 Treatment algorithm.van Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 3 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/107
people. We also used ‘proxies ’by gathering information
from healthcare providers on behalf of the elderly people
about non-participation.
One of two interviewers (MH or IvB) held individ-
ual interviews face-to-face at respondents ’homes
(participants) or by telephone (GPs, physiotherapists,
and trainer). MH led focus group discussions at subjects ’
working places. They lasted between 5 and 87 minutes(participants), 39 and 96 minutes (team of nurses), 6
and 22 minutes (individual GPs), 32 and 51 minutes
(physiotherapists), and 43 minutes (trainer). All interviewsand focus group discussions were digitally recorded with
the consent of the participants, and field notes were
made. Data were collected between September 2011and June 2012.Quantitative data collection
The process evaluation used qualitative and quantitativedata to triangulate significa nt findings [25]. Data from
participants with depressive symptoms were collected at
baseline (telephone interviews and self-report question-naires) and every three months (s elf-report questionnaires).
Additionally, nurses were req uested to fill out evaluation
forms for each client about the course of the treatment.
Measurements
Qualitative measurements
Semi-structured interview guides were created for each
stakeholder that consisted of open-ended questions and
were parallel in content as much as possible. To enquire
about all relevant factors enabling or hindering theFigure 2 Overview of qualitative data collection: interviews and focus group discussions with different stakeholders.van Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 4 of 13

implementation process, Grol and Wensing ’s framework
was used to build the interview guides [26]. This
framework was derived from various theories andmodels on determinants of implementation practice
and included the following levels: factors related to the
innovation; individual professional; patient; and context(social, organisational, economic and political context). As
we believe that factors may differ across the different
phases of the implementation process, these levelswere studied pre- and post-implementation by inter-
viewing respondents at different moments during the
implementation process.
Stakeholders were asked about their expectations for the
‘Lust for Life ’programme, motivation for participation,
experiences with various components of the programmeand strategy ( e.g., case finding, [transition to] interventions,
prerequisites for optimal implementation). The main focus
was on factors that facilitate or hinder implementation.Interview guides also contained stakeholder-specific
questions. In the interviews/focus group discussions
with nurses and physiotherapists, certain importantthemes emerging in interviews in one group of stakeholders
were verified with participants in another member
group in subsequent interviews when they did notcome up spontaneously.
Quantitative measurements
Severity of depression, the primary outcome measure
for the quantitative analyses, was measured with the
PHQ-9, which consists of nine items with total scoresranging from 0 to 27. Subjective need for care was
addressed at baseline by the Perceived Need for Care
Questionnaire (PNCQ; [27]). The PNCQ is a fully struc-tured interview that assesses the subject ’sp e r c e p t i o no f
the presence of a mental problem, the perceived need for
treatment, and the use of healthcare services in the pastthree months. Subjects who received care for a mental
problem were asked if their needs were (fully) met.
Confounders included educational level, age, dwellingplace, and physical functioning (Modified Katz Activities
of Daily Living) (KATZ ADL; [28]), at baseline.
Data analysis
Initially, qualitative and quantitative data were analysed
separately. Results on the same topic were integratedlater to verify and corroborate findings from different
approaches about the same phenomenon (triangulation;
[29]) and to elaborate or clarify the results from onemethod by the other (complementarity; [30]).
Qualitative data analysis
All interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed
verbatim. Transcripts were read, and reread, and coding
trees consisting of key themes and subthemes that emergedf r o mt h ed a t aw e r eb u i l ti nA t l a s5 . 2f o re a c hs t a k e h o l d e r .
For instance, the coding tree for the focus group
discussions with nurses consisted of several keythemes such as ‘guided self-help: experiences from
nurses ’. Within the key themes, different levels of
codes were constructed and ordered within ‘facilitating
factors ’or‘hindering factors ’to the implementation of the
intervention programme ( e.g.,‘hindering factor - the level
of guided self-help course ’). Each code further con-
sisted of several subcodes ( e.g.,‘guided self-help course
is too difficult for self-study, ’‘guided self-help course
is too confronting, ’etc.).
MH and IvB coded transcripts independently, and
discussed until they reached consensus. To ensure that data
were understood from different perspectives, an experi-enced researcher in implementation research (ML) was
closely involved in data codin g and interpretation. Coded
interviews were scrutinized for underlying themes andassociations between themes by applying a grounded theory
approach [31]. Data were furth er examined for convergent
or divergent perspectives from different stakeholders.Summaries of (sub)codes were written and exemplified by
adding quotations from the original transcripts.
Data on reasons for declining the intervention
offer provided by non-respondents on the screening
questionnaire or during the telephone conversation with
research staff were coded separately and consequentlycompared to data derived from the interviews and focus
group discussions.
Peer debriefing took place by regular team meetings in
which original data, summaries of (sub)codes and results
were presented and discussed [32]. Finally, all findings and
codes were additionally clu stered according to the two
fundamental aspects of the programme: case finding, and
the stepped care preference-led interventions (see Table 1).
Quantitative data analysis
Data were analysed according to the intention to treat
principle using Generalized Estimating Equations with anautoregressive correlation structure to take into account
repeated measurements within patients. Time trend was
corrected for by including the time since the start of thefirst implementation (in units of three-month intervals) as
a categorical variable in all models. The start of implemen-
tation was individually defined for each subject as the dateof their intake session with the nurse. In the subgroup
analyses, nurses ’backgrounds, and intervention decisions
made were separately added to the model as interactionterms, corrected for confounders (age, educational level,
the dwelling place, and daily functioning).

‘Lust for Life ’programme. Quotes are from participants,
home care (HC) or mental healthcare (MHC) nurses,
GP and the trainer.
Theme I: proactive case finding
The first essential aspect of the ‘Lust for Life ’programme
examined was pro-active case finding. All enlisted
persons of 65 years and older (N = 9,661) from 18general practices and one home care facility were
screened for depressive symptoms using the self-report
PHQ-9. Figure 3 shows that 263 persons wanted toparticipate and met inclusion criteria, and 138 enrolled
(52.5%).
Since the prevalence of depressive symptoms in
community-dwelling older adults is estimated at 13.5%, thecase-finding procedure was aimed at the approximately
1,300 persons with depressive symptoms among all those
9,661 invited. Eventually, we only included 2.7% of allscreened individuals in the study and 1.5% took part. The
semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions
with all stakeholders provide an understanding of thislimited reach. Notably, perspectives from respondentsTable 1 Overview of determinants that facilitated or hindered the implementation of the ‘Lust for Life ’programme

Provision of the
interventionsMuch guidance was required in the provision of the self-help course.
Physiotherapists missed opportunities to discuss depressive symptoms
with participants; the exercise programme could not be provided
according to the protocol ’s demanded intensity.
Nurses questioned whether participants adopted the intervention
methods in Life Review and PST.
Referrals to specialised mental healthcare when depressive symptoms
remained were not always considered appropriate.
Context Embedment in
different
organisationsLimited embedment caused high work pressure on the home care
nurses. Embedment of the programme in specialised mental healthcare
facilitated additional treatment by this organisation when depressivesymptoms remained.van Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014,

with depressive symptoms were presented by those who
were included, and consequently decided to accept or
refuse our intervention offer, unless specified otherwise.
Factors related to participants with depressive symptoms
Two factors emerged at the level of older people with
depressive symptoms: participants ’illness perceptions, and
their perceived needs for the ‘Lust for Life ’programme.
Illness perceptions
The way older people with depressive symptoms ( i.e.,
PHQ ≥6) perceived their distress appeared to have great
influence on their willingness to participate. Quantitativematerial showed that among all participants who screened
positive for depressive symptoms (N = 758), many stated
not feeling ‘down, depressed or hopeless ’(PHQ, N = 172[28.1%]). Many declined participation for this reason: 69
persons (21.5% of those who provided reasons for refusal
on the screening questionnaire) indicated that they
did not perceive depressive symptoms. Also, several
participants who were included in the study did not
perceive ‘any mental or emotional problems ’(PNCQ,
N = 74 [28.1%]).
Qualitative results confirmed this finding: Approximately
half of all subjects did not feel that (medical) termssuch as having a depressed mood or being depressed
were applicable to their sit uation, especially those
who declined the intervention offer. Moreover, emotionaldistress was often not experienced as burdensome but
as part of normal ageing, in particular among those
who declined the interventions (see Additional file 2:Box 1, quote 1).Figure 3 Case finding results.van Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 7 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/107
Next, the qualitative interviews shed light on self-
perceived causes of emotional distress. For most par-
ticipants, their perceptions differed significantly fromthe biomedical model that presents depressive symp-
toms as a medical illness. Rather, ageing-related losses
such as declining health and loneliness were perceivedas the most prominent problems that caused mood
disturbances.
Perceived need for the ‘Lust for Life ’programme
Older people ’s attitudes toward the programme were a
second important factor that contributed to low use ofcare. In our quantitative data, we found that almost half
of all participants with depressive symptoms stated
that they did not perceive a need for care for a mentalproblem on the PNCQ (39.5%, N = 104) or that their need
for care was already met (8.0%, N = 21). Among those with
an unmet need for care (49.8%, N = 131), preferring tohandle emotional problems themselves was the most fre-
quently mentioned reason for this need to be unmet
(31.5%, N = 134 [reasons could be provided for mul-tiple needs to be unmet]). Most persons not included to
the study with depressive symptoms (PHQ ≥6) who
provided reasons for their refusal on the screeninginstrument stated that they perceived no need for care
(27.4%, N = 88).
T h es a m ef i n d i n g se m e r g e df r o mt h eq u a l i t a t i v e
data. Among those who perceived depressive symptoms
as hindering, many questioned whether they would
deserve to receive the intervention. For instance, becausethey preferred to manage problems themselves, or they
perceived their problems as a status-quo, that cannot or
does not have to be changed (see Additional file 2: Box 1,quote 2). This appropriateness issue was also recognised
by the healthcare professionals, as stated by a mental
healthcare nurse (see Additional file 2: Box 1, quote 3).During the focus group interviews, nurses also mentioned
that many participants already had sufficient coping skills
to handle their problems themselves.
Factors related to healthcare professionals
(and their interactions)
Case finding was the main aim for GPs to participate in
the study. They wished to get more insight into the
mental wellbeing of their patient population. Nurses alsovalued the aim of lowering barriers to care for people who
are reluctant to ask for help. However, their attitudes
toward screening were more critical, in particular of thenurses of a mental healthcare organisation that had
previously participated in a research project using
proactive case finding to include participants [8]. Nursesfelt that proactive case finding failed to include the target
group of people with depressive symptoms, who would
benefit from the interventions for several reasons. First,persons with a depressed mood who had little insight into
their emotional problems would be less inclined to fill in
the screening questionnaire compared to people who aremore self-reflexive (see Additional file 2: Box 2, quote 4).
Second, they were concerned that the procedure might
have a ‘honeypot effect ’on persons with particular
personality-related problems who would not benefit from
the interventions. Third, a screening procedure was
considered to be too insensitive to the fluctuation ofpeople ’s moods and would, therefore, lead to the unwanted
exclusion of many eligible persons.
Factors related to the innovation
Two factors emerged within the level of the innovation
(i.e., the case finding method): experiences with the case
finding procedure, and their perceived results.
Experiences with the case finding procedure
Most members had no problems with being screened
for depressive symptoms or even appreciated their
GP’s consideration. However, GPs found that the system
caused considerable disturbance among their entire more
elderly patient population. They suggested that several
elderly people were upset when they received the screeningq u e s t i o n n a i r e( s e eA d d i t i o n a lf i l e2 :B o x3 ,q u o t e5 ) .G P s
also noticed that the screening procedure was stressful to
their patients since many older adults did not know how torespond to the invitation. Perhaps this was caused by our
finding that many older people did not have any idea what
the programme entailed, despite our effort to carefullyprovide information about the programme by mail and
telephone. The research team also noticed this during
conversations with respondents who declined participa-tion in the study. Subsequently, it was cited by nurses and
most of the elderly people who took part in the interviews.
However, many participants did not express the need formore information (see Additional file 2: Box 3, quote 6).
Perceived results of the case finding procedure
Although GPs and nurses agreed with the inclusion of most
people, they mentioned that the outcomes in numbers of
persons taking part in the clinical interventions were disap-pointing. They stated furthermore that the system also
attracted persons from non-target groups such as individ-
uals with personality disorders. Screening did not provideinformation on whether participants perceived a need for
care, or whether a considerable part of the target group was
not reached (see Additional file 2: Box 3, quote 7). On theother hand, nurses and GPs appreciated that the case
finding system facilitated th e inclusion of respondents who
had not yet expressed a need for care to their physician.van Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 8 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/107
Context-related factors
Few context-related factors were mentioned of influence
on the low uptake of the case-finding procedure.Only GPs stated that various treatments were already
available for this group of older people with depressive
symptoms and, therefore, the programme did not offeranything new.
Theme II: the preference-led, stepped care interventions
To facilitate understanding of the factors related to the
clinical interventions that were of influence on the
implementation of the ‘Lust for Life ’program, Figure 4
shows the older adults ’treatment courses throughout
the programme.
Treatment courses could vary for individuals in clusters
one and two, where people could only begin with step one
intervention. In clusters three and four, people were
given the opportunity immediately to start with steptwo interventions if desirable, and drop-out rates aregiven for the differing clusters (data not shown in Figure 4).
In clusters one and two (N = 137), 47 persons (34%) fell out
of the programme after the intake session (N = 20, 14%), orquit the guided self-help course or the exercise programme
untimely (and dropped-out of the program; N = 27, 20%).
In clusters three and four (N = 126), participants could startimmediately with step two interventions: 22 persons (17%)
dropped out during the first period of the implementation
process: 9 persons (7%) dropped out after the intakesession, and 13 individuals (10%) quit the intervention of
their choice untimely (and dropped out of the program).
In clusters three and four, only 5 persons (4%) decidedimmediately to start with step two interventions.
Factors related to the participants with depressive
symptoms
Two factors emerged at this level: participants ’preferences
for the clinical interventions and the transition to subse-quent steps in the programme.
Figure 4 Participants ’course during the intervention programme.van Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 9 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/107
Participants ’preferences for the clinical interventions
Of all persons who took part in the interventions (N = 137),
most chose to participate in the guided self-helpcourse (N = 86, 63%; Figure 4). A total of 38 persons
( 2 8 % )s i g n e du pf o rt h ee x e r c i s ep r o g r a m m e ,a n d9
individuals participated in both (7%). Among elderlypeople who followed a step two intervention, life review
was more frequently chosen (N = 23, 56%) than PST
(N = 16, 39%); two individuals participated in bothinterventions (5%).
It became clear that older adults ’illness perceptions
played a crucial role in the treatment decisions theymade. Interestingly, we noticed that persons ’choices for
the training programme and life review were more natural
and more convincingly made than for other interventions(see Additional file 2: Box 4, quote 8). Perhaps their
content was easier to capture, which facilitated decision
making, or these interventions were considered lessstigmatising since they less stressed their aim of alleviating
mental problems. When motivating their choice for
the training programme or life review, more agedpeople mentioned reasons that were hardly related to
reducing mental distress, such as enjoying sports or
loving to talk about the past (see Additional file 2:Box 4, quote 9).
Reasons for participants to participate in the guided
self-help course were that they preferred to work on theintervention in their own time or because they wanted
to give the self-help book the benefit of the doubt. For
several elderly people in clusters one and two, it was thesecond best option since they already exercised, were
too limited in their mobility to reach the gym, or did not
like to join a group activity. None of the older peoplewho participated in PST could provide an explanation
for why they had chosen this intervention.
Transitions to subsequent steps
Older adults with persistent depressive symptoms
(PHQ ≥6) were offered participation in a subsequent
step after having finished their first intervention. Of
those eligible (N = 60), 38 (57%) persons took part in the
second intervention, and 4 out of 12 eligible (33%) in athird (referral to the GP). A total of 19 persons (7%)
were offered an early switch to the second intervention to
prevent drop-out.
Again, illness perceptions were essential to persons ’
decisions to take part in additional interventions. Few
elderly people mentioned that they perceived persistentdepressive symptoms that motivated them to accept
further treatment (see Additional file 2: Box 4, quote
10). For many other persons, however, their lack ofself-perceived depressive symptoms or need for help
were decisive to refuse further treatment in step two
(see Additional file 2: Box 4, quote 11).Factors related to the healthcare professionals
(and their interactions)
Relationship with the effectiveness of the ‘Lust for Life ’
programme
Quantitative analyses revealed that the effectiveness of
the clinical interventions varied with the kind of nurseswho provided the interventions (Wald = 26.659, df = 8,
p = 0.001). Stratified analyses showed that depressive
symptoms of participants who were treated by mentalhealthcare nurses in Amsterdam (Wald = 31.360, df = 8,
p = 0.000) or West-Friesland (Wald = 16.333, df = 8,
p = 0.038) declined, while participants treated by the homecare nurses showed no improvement of their depressive
symptoms (Wald = 9.887, df = 8, p = 0.273).
Data from the qualitative interviews could shed light
on this finding. Factors related to healthcare professions
that emerged from the data included: their backgrounds,
and interactions between different healthcare professionals.
Healthcare professionals ’backgrounds
Nurses ’differing backgrounds and skills appeared to be of
great influence on their attitudes toward the programme,
confidence in their capacities, and presumably the way
they provided the interventions.
Home care nurses were used to working with clients
with mainly physical disabilities, in a solution-based
manner that led to quick, visible results, and felt that the‘Lust for Life ’education did not provide them with sufficient
equipment to provide the interventions. Perhaps as a
consequence, they perceived the ‘Lust for Life ’work
as burdening and doubted the suitability and efficacy
of the clinical interventions since they perceived little
change in people ’s moods (see Additional file 2: Box 5,
quote 12). They further questi oned the eligibility of partici-
pants for the programme because it took much effort to
motivate them to accept and work with the interventions(see Additional file 2: Box 5, quote 13).
On the other hand, nurses of the mental healthcare
organisations were (very) experienced in working witholder people with depressive symptoms. They perceived
the training as not challenging enough, were confident
about their own skills to provide the interventions, weresupportive of the interventions, and perceived the limited
motivation of elderly people as a significant challenge in
their jobs instead of as a characteristic of their clients(see Additional file 2: Box 5, quote 14).
Healthcare professionals ’interactions
The nurses and physiotherapists did not experience
working together as a team, and they missed out on
information and involvement from one another. Moreprecisely, physiotherapists would have liked to receive
more information about the intake from the nurses
while the nurses regretted the very limited involvementvan Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 10 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/107
of the GPs since they all saw the advantages of more
contact with them. Most GPs however did not mention
concerns about not knowing the “Lust for Life ”nurses.
Perhaps this is related to the fact that GPs were mostly
motivated for the programme because of the case finding
procedure, and not necessarily because of the interventionsthat followed. An important factor that facilitated
professional ’s interactions in West-Friesland (compared to
the other locations) was that nurses and physiotherapistswere able to work in the same electronic medical file,
which enhanced the exchange of information.
Factors related to the innovation ( i.e., the clinical
interventions)
About the relationship between intervention choice and
effectiveness, the most important facilitating factor that
emerged from interviews with almost all participants
was the interaction and personal contact with the nursesand/or physiotherapists. About the suitability of the
interventions and self-perceived effects, participants and
nurses were most critical about the guided self-helpcourse, and nurses had doubts about the effects of Life
Review and PST. About the provision of the clinical
interventions, the limited embedding of the programmein different organisations and healthcare professions
was seen as the most important limiting factor. See
Additional file 3 for the detailed results.
Context-related factors
The limited embedding of the programme in different orga-nisations and healthcare professions put pressure on espe-
cially the home care nurses. Their high workload often kept
them from spending sufficient time on training and provid-ing the interventions (see Additional file 2: Box 7, quote 22).
It also had consequences for the way participants
with persistent depressive symptoms were referred toadditional treatments after having finished step two.
Referrals to a general practitioner were scarcely made
for participants treated by home care nurses andnurses of a mental healthcare organisation aimed at
short-term treatment. However, for nurses of specialised
mental healthcare organisations, transfers to step threewere more easily made. They frequently transferred the
participants they treated in the ‘Lust for Life ’program
to their regular caseloads when symptoms persisted(see Additional file 2: Box 7, quote 23).
Discussion
The aim of this study was to provide a contextua-
lised understanding of fact ors facilitating and hinder-
ing implementation of the ‘Lust for Life ’programme.
The programme consisted of two essential elements: first,
we performed proactive case-finding, and second, pro-
vided stepped care preference-led interventions byoffering multiple treatment options in every step. Our
study showed a) that large-scale proactive case finding
through screening to recruit participants was ineffective.Yet, the clinical interventions themselves b) reduced
depressive symptoms. Our less ons were that the agreement
between participant and healthcare professional onperceived need for care and type of intervention were
crucial. Our data suggest that one single preference-led
intervention is perhaps as effective as a whole programme.
Stepped care preference-led interventions
To optimize treatment of late life depressive symptoms, weoffered evidence-based interventions at the lowest possible
intensity (stepped care) and provided interventions
according to respondents ’preferences (preference-led care).
Drop-out rates were still cons iderable (see Figure 4) [33].
We advise to take into account perceived needs for
help. Interventions aimed at personal contact withothers or with the nurses suited people ’s needs better than
the (more individually) guided self-help course. Participants
were most enthusiastic about the exercise programme orlife review. Several interviewees considered PST to be too
difficult. The higher drop-out for the PST users compared
to the life review group confirmed this limitation.Remarkably, the program was only effective in the first
three months, and many people decided against second or
third steps when indicated.
To explore implementation potential for other healthcare
workers less used to working with older people with
emotional distress, both (experienced) mental healthcarenurses and home care nurses offered the clinical
interventions to explore implementation potential for
other healthcare workers less used to working with olderpeople with emotional distress. Older people treated by a
mental healthcare nurse had fewer depressive symptoms,
whereas persons treated by home care nurses showed noimprovement. These results should be interpreted with
care since allocation to mental healthcare or home care
nurses was not randomised.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths are the use of both quantitative and qualitativemethods that enabled us to gain a comprehensive
and contextualised understanding of the implementa-
tion process. Data triangulation further strengthensour conclusions since findings obtained by qualitative
and quantitative data point into the same direction.
Another strength concerns ou r extensive qualitative
research with all stakeholders involved in the implementa-
tion process, and our thorough analyses of the data by
having two researchers double-code and discuss allthe data collected. Lastly, the chosen stepped-wedge
randomised-cluster design gave us a unique opportunity
to study the implementation process and consequentlyvan Beljouw et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:107 Page 11 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/107
change and study the (adjusted) implementation strategy
in following clusters according to significant findings.
Our study also has limitations. A stepped wedge
design is attractive for implementation research as it
allows both an estimate of effect and a flexible, hybrid
design, making it possible to improve implementation.However, this type of design has more threats to the
validity of the comparisons of the different interventions
than, for instance, cluster randomised trials, includingthe non-randomised allocation and power issues.
Second, during interviews and focus groups, we could have
focused more on facilitating factors. Context-related factorswere also slightly underrepre sented in our data. Third, to
prevent drop-out and adjust the programme to participants ’
preferences, we provided an opportunity to choose.Fortunately, the impact of this protocol deviation was
limited since only five persons (4%) chose. Yet, since data
from quantitative and qualitative findings and perspectivesfrom multiple stakeholders all point to the same relevant
factors, we feel that we have captured the most important
perspectives on implementation.
Conclusions
Although the ‘Lust for Life ’programme reduced depressive
symptoms, several factors on all implementation levels
hindered implementation. Our findings add to the notion
that universal prevention by depression programmes, witha screening component addressing an entire population, is
not effective and should not be rolled out in daily practice.
This is an important findi ng in the Dutch context of
insurers gradually making scr eening procedures mandatory
in primary care [34]. Before treatment modalities are to be
provided, we also plead for sig nificant attention to illness
perceptions and perceived need for care. Perhaps it suffices
to offer all available interventions at once instead of
providing them according to stepped care principles.Adequate provision also requires that nurses have signifi-
cant skills. Implementation is more suitable in (generic)
mental healthcare settings or primary care than in homecare organizations. The ‘Lust for Life ’program provides a
good starting point for improving late life depression
management in the community.
