Abstract 
Background Impairment of arm movement occurs in up to 85% of people post-stroke, affecting daily living activi-
ties, and quality of life. Mental imagery effectively enhances hand and daily function in people with stroke. Imagery 
can be performed when people imagine themselves completing the movement or imagine another person doing it. 
However, there is no report on the specific use of first-person and third-person imagery in stroke rehabilitation.
Aims To develop and assess the feasibility of the First-Person Mental Imagery (FPMI) and the Third-Person Mental 
Imagery (TPMI) programs to address the hand function of people with stroke living in the community.
Methods This study comprises phase 1—development of the FPMI and TPMI programs, and phase 2—pilot-testing 
of the intervention programs. The two programs were developed from existing literature and reviewed by an expert 
panel. Six participants with stroke, living in the community, participated in the pilot-testing of the FPMI and TPMI 
programs for 2 weeks. Feedback collected included the suitability of the eligibility criteria, therapist’s and participant’s 
adherence to intervention and instructions, appropriateness of the outcome measures, and completion of the inter -
vention sessions within the specified time.
Results The FPMI and TPMI programs were developed based on previously established programs and included 
12 hand tasks. The participants completed four 45-min sessions in 2 weeks. The treating therapist adhered to the 
program protocol and completed all the steps within the specified time frame. All hand tasks were suitable for adults 
with stroke. Participants followed the instructions given and engaged in imagery. The outcome measures selected 
were appropriate for the participants. Both programs showed a positive trend towards improvement in participants’ 
upper extremity and hand function and self-perceived performance in activities of daily living.
Conclusions The study provides preliminary evidence that these programs and outcome measures are feasible for 
implementation with adults with stroke living in the community. This study outlines a realistic plan for future trials 
in relation to participant recruitment, training of therapists on the intervention delivery, and the use of outcome 
measures.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• This study tested the viability of the First-Person 
Mental Imagery and the Third-Person Mental 
Imagery program programs before implementation 
in a randomized controlled trial.
• The findings showed that the participants’ eligibility 
criteria and outcome measures were suitable. Par -
ticipants and therapists could adhere to the program, 
follow the instructions and complete the sessions 
within the specified time. Participants also showed 
an improving trend in the outcome measures used.
• The literature revealed the unique benefits of the two 
perspectives of imagery. This feasibility study pro -
vided experts’ opinions on the development of the 
two programs. The two programs are deemed feasi -
ble concerning the recruitment and assessment pro -
cedures for conducting a randomized controlled trial 
to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention.
Background
Stroke is reported as the second or third most common 
cause of death [1]. It was reported that impairment of 
arm movement occurs in up to 85% of people post-stroke 
[2]. Impairment in arm and hand function may lead to a 
significant long-term impact on activities of daily living, 
work and leisure, and a corresponding decreased percep -
tion of quality of life [3]. Gradual improvement in arm 
and hand movement in people post-stroke is seen until 
at least 1 year post-hospital discharge [4]. Therefore, it is 
essential to address the arm and hand impairment of peo -
ple with stroke living in the community. Motor imagery 
(MI) refers to mentally practising a task without physi -
cally performing it [5]. Evidence exists that MI, combined 
with actual task practice, can improve hand function in 
people with stroke [6]. Neuroimaging studies have shown 
that MI activates similar brain regions as occurs when 
people execute the actual movement [7]. Kho, Liu [6] 
reported that the benefits of MI, with activations of simi -
lar brain regions similar to actual movement, might allow 
people with stroke who could not physically move their 
limbs to have those brain regions stimulated.
There are two methods of practicing MI: First-Person 
Motor Imagery (FPMI) and Third-Person Motor Imagery 
(TPMI) [8–10]. In FPMI, the persons imagine performing 
the movement from inside their body [11]. In TPMI, the 
persons imagine performing the movement from the out -
side of their body or imagines someone else performing 
the movement [8, 9, 11, 12]. Individuals might feel more 
motivated to succeed on a future task when they visualize 
its successful completion from a third-person perspective [13]. Neuroimaging studies have identified that FPMI 
and TPMI share activations in both common and differ -
ent cortical areas of the brain [14]. FPMI and TPMI were 
found to associate with activation in the motor areas 
such as the supplementary motor area and the precen -
tral gyrus, the visual area such as the middle temporal/V5 
complex, and the precuneus for memory tasks. In addi -
tion, FPMI might require more interpretation of sensory 
information and involved the right inferior parietal, pre -
cuneus, and somatosensory cortex.
In summary, the literature suggests that the FPMI may 
better resemble the actual motor performance while 
the TPMI may enhance motivation and self-perception 
in addition to motor functions. However, this proposi -
tion has not been adequately investigated in people with 
stroke. Depending on the needs of people with stroke 
and the purpose of rehabilitation, this research may pro -
vide information to assist clinicians in using the specific 
imagery perspective, which can further promote the 
rehabilitation outcome.
Aims and objectives
This study aimed to test the viability of the FPMI and 
TPMI programs before implementation in a randomized 
controlled trial. The study developed two novel mental 
imagery intervention programs by reviewing the litera -
ture, collecting feedback, and obtaining consensus from 
an expert panel on critical parameters for people with 
stroke living in the community. The developed programs 
were pilot-tested for 2  weeks on six people with stroke 
living in the community.
Methods
The study was conducted in two phases. Wight, Wim -
bush [15]’s steps in quality intervention development 
were adopted. Phase 1 included [1] defining and under -
standing the problem and existing interventions by a 
review of literature and [2] identifying parameters to 
modify, and adapting the intervention by collecting feed -
back from the experts who are the therapists delivering 
the intervention. Phase 2 involved testing the interven -
tion protocols on people with stroke living in the com -
munity. The study combined published research evidence 
with the views and actions of people who would use the 
intervention programs [16].
Ethics approval was obtained from the Human 
Research Ethics Committee at the Western Sydney 
University (reference number H12057), Ethics Review

Phase 1
Aim
The aim of the study is to develop the FPMI and TPMI 
intervention programs and collect feedback from an 
expert panel to review the viability of the intervention 
programs.
Methods
The first step in this stage involved the development of 
the intervention programs. We completed a systematic 
review to identify the mental imagery strategies previ -
ously used and applicable to people post-stroke [17]. 
This revealed the use of the first-person and the third-
person imagery and 12 daily hand tasks. A draft pro -
gram outline was developed.
The second step involved feedback from four experts 
in stroke rehabilitation in Sri Lanka on the viability of the 
intervention programs in Sri Lanka [16]. The experts were 
occupational therapists with 6 to 17 years of experience in 
stroke rehabilitation. The therapists were provided with 
the two intervention manuals, including the materials 
used such as the cue cards and video recordings, and were 
asked to rate and comment on (1) suitability of the inter -
vention programs for adults with stroke living in the com -
munity, (2) appropriateness of the daily hand tasks used 
in the programs for adults with stroke, (3) appropriateness 
of the frequency and duration of the programs, and (5) 
clarity of instructions in the intervention programs. Panel 
members were asked to rate these five questions using a 
5-point Likert scale where 1 = poor, 2 =  fair, 3 =  good, 
4 = very good, and 5 = excellent. The expert panel review 
was conducted online. Panel members were requested to 
comment further if they provided 1 (poor) or 2 (fair) rat -
ings. Based on the feedback received, the research team 
discussed and revised the programs. 
Results
All four panel members were Sri Lankan occupational 
therapists who have had over five years of experience in 
the field of neurological rehabilitation and possessed a 
Bachelor’s degree in occupational therapy (Table 1 ).
Expert panel’s opinion
All questions received a median rating of 3 and above 
(good to excellent) for both the FPMI and TPMI pro -
grams. The lowest median rating of 3 (good) was found 
in frequency and duration of both programs. One ther -
apist suggested allowing more time for the whole pro -
gram. After reviewing findings from previous studies 
that showed positive effects after 6 weeks of MI train -
ing in patients with sub-acute stroke [10, 18], the pro -
gram was adjusted to be delivered over 6 weeks.The FPMI and TPMI programs
The FPMI and TPMI intervention programs developed 
were based on previous programs designed for peo -
ple with stroke [10, 19] and incorporated 12 daily hand 
tasks. In the FPMI program, the therapist would guide 
the participants to perform the task first, which would 
allow the participants to self-generate images of the task 
steps involved. In the TPMI program, video recordings 
of someone else performing the task would be shown 
to participants using a computer laptop, providing the 
prompt to generate and imagine the steps involved. The 
video recordings of the tasks lasted for less than 1 min. 
The frequency and duration of the FPMI and TPMI inter -
vention programs were set following the standard occu -
pational therapy practice in Sri Lanka and also similar 
to the schedule of two MI studies which demonstrated 
a significant improvement in the treatment groups [10, 
20]. Both programs were to be conducted in a quiet clinic 
room free from distraction. The full programs included 
two intervention sessions a week for 6 weeks, with each 
session lasting 45  min in duration. Sessions of 45  min 
also matched with the duration of an occupational ther -
apy session in public hospitals in Sri Lanka. Additional 
file 1: Appendix I provides further details about the inter -
vention programs.
Phase 2
Aim
To pilot-test the FPMI and TPMI programs and study 
protocols by reviewing (1) suitability of the eligibility cri -
teria, (2) therapist’s and participant’s adherence to inter -
vention, (3) participant’s ability to follow the instructions, 
and (4) participant’s completion of the intervention ses -
sions within the specified time.
Methods
The feasibility and program outcomes of both inter -
vention protocols were pilot-tested for 2  weeks (four 
sessions) using a pre- and post-program design. Six 
participants from the neurology clinics at two teach -
ing hospitals in Colombo, Sri Lanka, were recruited by Table 1 Expert panel

convenience sampling. Previous studies indicate that 
six participants is adequate to assess the feasibility of 
intervention programs [21]. Medical staff in the neurol -
ogy clinics identified potential participants. Participants 
were invited to take part in this study via flyers. Writ -
ten informed consent was obtained from all participants 
before involvement in the study. The assessment used 
in screening the potential participants are standardised 
with good reliability and validity.
Eligible participants
1. Were aged between 18 and 80 years
2. Had a diagnosis of hemiplegia due to stroke (infarct 
or haemorrhage)
3. Experienced a stroke more than 3  months prior to 
study enrolment (Bernhardt et al., 2017)
4. Resided in the community
5. Were able to complete advanced hand activities 1, 2, 
and 3 of Motor Assessment Scale (Carr et al., 1985)
6. Had a score of ≥ 24 points on the Mini-Mental State 
Exam [22]
7. Provided voluntary consent to participate in the 
study
People were excluded from the study if they had the 
following:
1. Visual and perceptual problems including hemiano -
pia and unilateral neglect
2. Excessive pain in the affected arm as measured by a 
score of ≥ 4 on a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale [23]
3. Spasticity of ≥ 3 on the Modified Ashworth Scale [24]
4. Pre-existing musculoskeletal, neurological (apart 
from a stroke), or other conditions that may affect 
upper limb function
Feasibility of the FPMI and TPMI programs
Feasibility criteria of the intervention programs exam -
ined the (1) suitability of the eligibility criteria, (2) partic -
ipant and therapist adherence to intervention, (3) ability 
of participants to follow the instructions, and (4) whether 
participants were able to complete the intervention ses -
sions within the specified time. 
A research assistant, who was an occupational thera -
pist with over 5  years of experience in the field of neu -
rological rehabilitation and possessed a bachelor’s degree 
in occupational therapy, delivering the interventions and 
collected information regarding the feasibility criteria. 
This research assistant was a different person from the 
Phase 1 expert panel. The training was provided by the 
primary researcher in delivering the intervention.Pilot‑testing
Eight outcome measures were identified for the pilot 
study and were tested on the participants before and after 
the intervention. The primary researcher was the asses -
sor and conducted all assessments. These outcome meas -
ures represented four domains of functions:
(1) Performance-based upper extremity and hand func -
tion (Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) 
[25], Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recov -
ery after Stroke (FMA) [26], Nine Hole Peg Test 
(NHPT) [27], In-Hand Manipulation Assessment 
(IHMA) [28]).
(2) Self-perceived upper extremity and hand func -
tion [Motor Activity Log (MAL) [29], with both 
Amount of Use (AOU) and Quality of Movement 
(QOM)].
(3) Self-perceived daily functions (Lawton Instrumen -
tal Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL) [30], 
Canadian Occupational Performance Measure 
(COPM) including performance (COPM-P) and 
satisfaction (COPM-S) [31]).
(4) Quality of life (Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale 
(SSQOL) [32]).
Information on the outcome measures is provided 
in Additional file  2: Appendix II. Data was collected 
before and after implementation of the intervention. The 
description of the participant’s responses to the study 
processes and outcomes are reported to support the clin -
ical application.
Results and discussion
Six participants (aged between 46 and 67  years) were 
recruited and completed the pilot-testing (three in the 
FPMI program and three in the TPMI programs). They 
ranged in. pseudonyms were assigned to the participants 
(Table 2).
Feasibility of the FPMI and TPMI programs
The treating therapist was able to adhere to the programs 
and completed all the steps in the FPMI and TPMI pro -
grams for each hand task within 15 min and three daily 
hand tasks in 45 min. It was identified that all hand tasks 
were suitable for adults with stroke. 
All participants were able to engage in the intervention 
program. They were also able to follow the instructions 
given by the treating therapist and engage in imagery 
from the first-person perspective for 8 min for each hand 
task without distraction. All participants reported that 
they were able to imagine the task “clearly and reason -
ably vividly” during the task practice. Two participants 
reported dryness of mouth during the thinking aloud

component. Providing a glass of water for participants 
was used to address this problem. During the feedback, 
when viewing the video recording, a participant com -
mented that keeping the video footage about 2 ft. away 
would be suitable.
The above information showed that the selection crite -
ria were appropriate. Participants had the required hand 
function to practise the hand tasks for the time neces -
sary, they had the cognitive ability to follow instructions, 
perform imagery and complete all the tasks.
Pilot testing
While the clinical significance of the change of scores 
could not be established with only the pilot testing of 
four intervention sessions, individual results of the three 
cases showed a positive trend towards improvement in 
the performance-based and self-perceived upper extrem -
ity and hand function. All participants, except Partici -
pant #3 (TPMI), showed improvement in self-perceived 
daily functions. This 60-year-old male with a right-sided 
stroke did not show improvement in IADLS. However, 
COPM-P and COPM-S, which measured self-perceived 
daily functions, showed a slight improvement in all three 
participants.
Participant #6, the oldest participant in the TPMI 
group (60  years) who experienced his stroke 9  months 
ago, might be functioning at a stable level. Therefore, 
instrumental activities such as shopping, laundry, trans -
port, and food preparation would not show a remarkable 
improvement with only 2 weeks of MI practice.
The results of the six participants are overviewed 
below.
Participant #1 (completed the FPMI program)
Participant #1 was a 62-year-old male with right-sided 
weakness following an intracranial hemorrhage 6 months 
ago. He is right-hand dominant. He attended regular 
occupational therapy and physiotherapy twice a week. 
After attending four treatment sessions in the pilot 
study, all outcome measures of the upper extremity and hand function showed a positive trend towards improve -
ment. The time for completing JTHFT and NHPT was 
slightly reduced (Fig.  1). There was a slight improvement 
in FMA, IHMA, MAL-AOU, and MAL-QOM (Figs.  1 
and 2). After attending four sessions of FPMI interven -
tion, there was an improvement of IADLS, COPM-P , and 
COPM-S (Fig.  3). A positive trend of improvement was 
observed in SSQOL (Fig. 4).
Participant #2 (completed the FPMI program)
Participant #2 was a 52-year-old female with right-
sided weakness resulting from left cortical infarction 
28 months ago. She is right-hand dominant. She attended 
occupational therapy twice a week. After attending four 
treatment sessions of FPMI, all the upper extremity and 
hand function measures showed a positive trend towards 
improvement. The time for completing JTHFT and 
NHPT were slightly reduced (Fig.  1). There was a slight 
improvement in FMA, IHMA, MAL-AOU, and MAL-
QOM (Figs.  1 and 2). IADLS and COPM-P were the 
same after the four sessions of FPMI program (Fig.  3). 
However, a slight improvement in COPM-S indicated a 
positive trend towards improvement in daily functions 
(Fig.  3). There was also a positive trend towards improve -
ment from baseline to post-program assessment in 
SSQOL (Fig. 4).
Participant #3 (completed the FPMI program)
Participant #3 was a 67-year-old female with right-sided 
weakness resulting from a left ischemic stroke 11 months 
ago. She is right-hand dominant. She attended occu -
pational therapy twice a week. At the end of four treat -
ment sessions in 2  weeks, all the upper extremity and 
hand function measures showed a positive trend towards 
improvement. The time for completing JTHFT and 
NHPT was slightly reduced (Fig.  1). There was a slight 
improvement in FMA, IHMA MAL-AOU, and MAL-
QOM (Figs.  1 and 2). There was also a slight improve -
ment in IADLS, COPM-P , and COPM-S, which indicated 
a slight improvement in self-perceived daily functions Table 2 Participants’ demographic data

(Fig.  3). A positive trend towards improvement was noted 
in SSQOL (Fig. 4).
The individual results of all three participants in 
the FPMI program showed a positive trend towards 
improvement in the performance-based and self-per -
ceived upper extremity and hand function. Two par -
ticipants in the FPMI group demonstrated a slight 
improvement in self-perceived activities of daily func -
tions as measured by IADLS and perceived performance 
and satisfaction of daily tasks measured by COPM-P 
and COPM-S, respectively. However, Participant #2, a 
46-year female with right side weakness, did not show 
progress in IADLS and COPM-P assessments but slight 
progress in COPM-S. This result can be interpreted as 
either these assessments were too simple and therefore 
had a ceiling effect, or a more extended period of train -
ing may be necessary for a positive outcome. Another 
possibility may be a disparity of the results between the 
performance-based and perceived outcome measures. 
A case study conducted to identify the effectiveness of 
CIMT also reported that irrespective of the remark -
able progress of functional tasks, the participants did 
not show improvement in perceived performance [33]. 
Gillot, Holder-Walls [34] also reported that decreased 
progress of perceived outcome measures reflected an 
increased expectation of functional ability.
While two participants in the FPMI group demon -
strated improved quality of life, Participant #2 showed a 
slight decrease. A possible explanation for this finding is 
that the perceived measurements were subjective to indi -
vidual cognitive and emotional status [35]. Participant #2 
was the youngest (46 years) in this cohort, and she may 
have set high expectations for her quality of life with the 
new intervention and may not have achieved the level 
expected in two weeks of practice.
Particpant #4 (completed the TPMI program)
Participant #4 was a 46-year-old female with left-sided 
weakness resulting from right frontoparietal infarction 
6 months ago. She is right-hand dominant. After attend -
ing four treatment sessions in 2  weeks, all the upper 
extremity and hand function measures showed a posi -
tive trend towards improvement. Compared to before 
and after the intervention, the time for completing 
JTHFT and NHPT was slightly reduced (Fig.  1). There 
was a slight improvement in FMA, IHMA, MAL-AOU, 
and MAL-QOM (Figs.  1 and 2). There was an improve -
ment in IADLS, COPM-P , and COPM-S after 2 weeks of 
the TPMI program (Fig.  3). However, there was a slight 
decrease in the SSQOL score after the intervention 
(Fig. 4).Participant #5 (completed the TPMI program)
Participant #5 was a 53-year-old female with right-sided 
weakness resulting from right frontoparietal infarction 
12 months ago. She is right-hand dominant. She attended 
occupational therapy and physiotherapy twice a week. 
After attending four treatment sessions in 2 weeks, all the 
upper extremity and hand function measures showed a 
positive trend of improvement. The time for completing 
JTHFT and NHPT was slightly reduced (Fig.  1). There 
was a slight improvement in FMA, IHMA, MAL-AOU, 
and MAL-QOM (Figs.  1 and 2). IADLS, COPM-P , and 
COPM-S demonstrated a slight improvement (Fig.  3). 
There was a positive trend towards improvement in 
SSQOL (Fig. 4).
Participant #6 (completed the TPMI program)
Participant #6 was a 60-year-old male with right-sided 
weakness resulting from left cortical infarction nine 
months ago. He is right-hand dominant. He attended 
occupational therapy and physiotherapy twice a week. 
After attending four treatment sessions, all performance-
based and self-perceived upper extremity and hand func -
tion measures showed a positive trend of improvement. 
The time for completing JTHFT and NHPT was slightly 
reduced (Fig.  1). There was a slight improvement in 
FMA, IHMA, MAL-AOU, and MAL-QOM (Figs.  1 and 
2). IADLS was the same after four sessions of the TPMI 
program (Fig.  3). However, there was a slight improve -
ment in COPM-S and COPM-P (Fig.  3). A positive trend 
of improvement in SSQOL was observed (Fig. 4).
General discussion
Mental imagery has demonstrated a beneficial role in 
improving daily function [19, 36, 37] and hand function 
[20, 38] in people with stroke. The benefits of first-person 
imagery from a self-generated image on the conscious -
ness of motor function [11, 39] and third-person imagery 
from an observed action in enhancing the subjective 
sense of body ownership [39–41] from the neuroscience 
perspective have also been demonstrated. Our study 
demonstrated the potential benefits of the FPMI and 
TPMI programs in promoting hand function for people 
with stroke living in the community. Currently, no study 
has reported the use of first-person and third-person 
imagery in rehabilitation. Only one study looked at the 
use of internal and external perspectives rather than first-
person and third-person imagery in stroke [10]. There are 
few studies reporting the use of first-person and third-
person imagery in other practice, for example, on sports 
skills [12]. As there appears to be unique benefits in these 
two perspectives of imagery, it is essential to research 
their use in people with stroke.

This study described the development of the FPMI and 
TPMI programs specifically targeting hand function for 
people with stroke living in the community and pilot-
testing the intervention protocols. The study found that 
both programs appeared viable for people with stroke 
living in the community. The selection criteria adopted 
in the pilot-testing were appropriate. Participants were 
able to follow the instructions and completed the inter -
vention sessions within the specified time. Participants 
were able to complete all outcome measures used with -
out significant issues. Suggestions had been provided 
regarding offering short breaks for taking water during 
the thinking aloud component and keeping the video 
footage about 2 ft. away during the TPMI program. Our 
results were in alignment with previous studies [19, 20, 
36–38] and showed a positive trend towards improve -
ment in hand and daily function after 2  weeks (four 
sessions) of the programs. The therapist delivering the 
intervention was able to adhere to the intervention pro -
tocols. Therapists were able to conduct the interven -
tion protocol of both the FPMI and TPMI programs as 
planned. As suggested by Nilsen, Gillen [10] and Page, 
Dunning [20], the results of this study also showed that 
a 45-min duration for the intervention session was suf -
ficient for adults with stroke living in the community. 
Our study was limited by the recruitment methods and 
the small number of participants in pilot testing. Full 
programs were not administered. Therefore, conduct -
ing a full randomized controlled trial is recommended to 
verify the effectiveness of the FPMI and TMPI programs. 
Futher research may consider exploring the benefits of 
FPMI and TPMI on people with different areas of brain 
lesions.
Conclusion
This study examined the development of the FPMI and 
TPMI intervention programs and their viability by trial -
ling the two programs with six adults with stroke living 
in the community. It provided preliminary evidence that 
these MI programs and outcome measures can be feasi -
bly implemented for adults with stroke living in the com -
munity. Both the FPMI and TPMI programs positively 
impacted performance-based upper extremity and hand 
function, self-perceived upper extremity and hand func -
tion, self-perceived daily functions and quality of life. 
Based on the findings, the study protocol for the FPMI 
and TPMI intervention programs for the future ran -
domised controlled trial was developed. Experience gath -
ered in this pilot-test enables development of a realistic 
plan for future trials in relation to participant recruit -
ment, training of therapists on the intervention delivery, 
and outcome measures.Abbreviations
