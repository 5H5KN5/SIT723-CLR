Abstract
Background: Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is common and destructive to health. Post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) is a major mental health consequence of DVA. People who have experienced DVA have specific
needs, arising from the repeated and complex nature of the trauma. The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence recommends more research on the effectiveness of psychological interventions for people who have
experienced DVA. There is growing evidence that mindfulness-based interventions may help trauma symptoms.
Methods: Intervention refinement and randomized controlled feasibility trial. A prototype trauma-informed
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (TI-MBCT) intervention will be co-produced following qualitative interviews
and consensus exercise with stakeholders. Participants in the feasibility trial will be recruited from DVA agencies in
two geographical regions and randomized to receive either TI-MBCT or usual care (self-referral to the Improving
Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service). TI-MBCT will be delivered as a group-based eight-week program. It
will not be possible to blind the participants or the assessors to the study allocation. The following factors will
inform the feasibility of progressing to a fully powered trial: recruitment, retention, intervention fidelity, and the
acceptability of the intervention and trial design to participants. We will also test the feasibility of measuring the
following participant outcomes before and 6 months post-randomization: PTSD, dissociative symptoms, depression,
anxiety, DVA re-victimization, self-compassion, and mother-reported child health. Process evaluation and economic
analysis will be embedded within the feasibility trial.
Discussion: This study will lead to the development of a TI-MBCT intervention for DVA survivors with PTSD and
inform the feasibility and design of a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). The full trial will aim to
determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a TI-MBCT intervention in improving the clinically important
symptoms of PTSD in DVA survivors.

Background
Mental health consequences of domestic violence and
abuse
Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a major public
health and clinical problem which is experienced by 1 in
4 women and 1 in 7 men in England and Wales [ 1]. Al-
though DVA is experienced by both women and men,
the impact on health is greater among women [ 2]. Be-
tween 6% and 17% of women attending primary care re-
port having been abused by a partner in the past year
[3]. The single biggest cost associated with DVA is to
the NHS: £1.7 billion per year, with the major cost borne
by acute trusts and primary care. Mental health service
costs are estimated to be an additional £176 million [ 4].
A major mental health consequence of DVA experienced
by women is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with a
7.3 odds ratio for the experience of intimate partner violence
in women with PTSD [ 5]. Another study found a two-fold
increase in the prevalence of PTSD among women with
higher levels of exposure to DVA [ 6]. A psychiatric morbid-
ity survey in England found that 12.6% of women aged 16 to
24 screened positive for PTSD [ 7]. Symptoms of PTSD in-
clude reliving the traumatic experience, hypervigilance,
avoidance, and cognitive distortions often related to beliefs
about safety, power, and self-wo rth that impair the ability to
break the cycle of abuse [ 8,9]. Although research findings
suggest a spontaneous recovery of PTSD in some people
who have experienced DVA, a s ignificant number (46.8%) of
women exhibit chronic PTSD [ 10].
In contrast to single-event trauma, DVA occurs repeat-
edly and often increases in severity over time [ 11].
Women who have experienced DVA represent a distinct
patient group due to the complexity of their trauma and
its specific impact on affect regulation, changes in con-
sciousness, sense of self, relationships, and belief systems
[12]. Survivors of DVA often have numerous and cumula-
tive psychosocial stressors, including poverty, lack of social
support, parenting stress, and ongoing contact with the
perpetrator through child contact [ 9,13]. For these
women, accessing standard trauma-focused treatments
can be practically difficult and emotionally problematic
[14–16]. There is also the need to address safety and the
risk of re-traumatization if there is ongoing contact with
the perpetrator [ 17]. The stigma associated with mental
health symptoms also leads to decreased use of mental
health services; women who have experienced DVA mayfear that a mental health diagnosis will result in their chil-
dren being removed from their care [ 13,18].
Impact on children
Children in families affected by DVA are at higher risk
of developmental and behavioral problems, compromis-
ing their lifelong wellbeing and functioning [ 19]. Chil-
dren whose mothers have experienced DVA and have
PTSD and depression are at higher risk of behavior
problems [ 20].
Evidence-based interventions for PTSD
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) guidance on PTSD advocates individual trauma-
focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) and eye
movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) as
evidence-based treatment options [ 21]. A Cochrane re-
view [ 22] showed that both therapies performed better
than usual care for reducing symptoms of PTSD. Both
therapies use exposure work, requiring participants to
directly confront their traumatic stories. In addition,
many of the study populations identified in the review
had experienced single event traumas. A significant pro-
portion of PTSD sufferers either do not seek help, drop
out of or decline these treatments, or continue to meet
diagnostic criteria for PTSD after trauma-focused inter-
ventions [ 23]. The NICE guidance recommends more
research on the effectiveness of psychological interven-
tions modified for DVA [ 24].
In contrast to trauma-focused approaches,
mindfulness-based interventions do not include
exposure work and therefore could be more accept-
able to survivors of DVA. Mindfulness-based interven-
tions have recently received increased attention for
helping patients who have experienced trauma [ 25,
26]. A recent systematic review [ 25] which included
four studies with people who have experienced
childhood abuse and DVA found some evidence that
mindfulness-oriented interventions may decrease
PTSD symptoms, although most studies were under-
p o w e r e da n dh a dm e t h o d o l o gical weaknesses. The re-
view identified the need for further modification of
mindfulness interventions for PTSD and further ad-
e q u a t e l yp o w e r e dr a n d o m i z e dc o n t r o l l e dt r i a l s( R C T s )
of the modified interventions.Pitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:33 Page 2 of 14
Pre-protocol development of a mindfulness intervention
for DVA trauma
This study is built on pre-protocol development work
carried out in 2014 –2015: (i) a synthesis of prior lit-
erature on mindfulness-oriented interventions for
DVA and PTSD, (ii) consultations with a group of
DVA survivors on potential adaptations to standard
mindfulness treatment, (iii ) consultation with mental
health professionals on the rationale behind mindful-
ness approaches for PTSD in the DVA population,
(iv) consultation with DVA advocates on the safety of
mindfulness approaches for women who have experi-
enced DVA, and the feasibility of recruitment through
third sector DVA agencies. Informed by this work, a
mindfulness teacher with expertise and experience in
trauma developed a trauma-informed intervention by
modifying the standard manual for preventing depres-
sion relapse (mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT)) (Millband S.: How can an adapted MBCT
course meet the specific vulnerabilities of women sur-
vivors of domestic violence and abuse? Unpublished
thesis: Bangor University; 2015). This adaptation
process was overseen by a mindfulness-based super-
visor with expertise in trauma. We call this modifica-
tion a trauma-informed mindfulness-based cognitive
therapy (TI-MBCT) prototype 1. This prototype inter-
vention was pre-piloted with a group of women who
had experienced DVA and their feedback was ob-
tained through a group interview. The feedback from
the pre-pilot testing suggested that the prototype TI-
MBCT program may be acceptable to a DVA popula-
tion and might be effective but required robust evalu-
ation with a randomized controlled design. Our pre-
protocol development work identified several areas of
uncertainty about the future trial associated with:
1. Choice of the control intervention. In a definitive
trial, the control intervention will be an evidence-
based manualized psychological intervention for
PTSD currently available within NHS Improving
Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services.
Our primary intention was to use trauma-informed
cognitive behavioral therapy (TI-CBT). However,
consultations with service user and professional
stakeholders revealed that in DVA agencies women
with mental health problems are signposted to their
GPs and IAPT services. The latter offers varied
treatments (e.g., trauma counseling, TF-CBT,
EMDR) depending on an individual ’s symptoms and
needs and practitioners ’availability.
2. Recruitment of DVA survivors with PTSD through
third sector DVA service
3. The randomization of DVA survivors with PTSD
4. Retention of DVA survivors with PTSD in the trial5. Uptake, retention, and acceptability of the modified
MBCT intervention to DVA survivors with PTSD
6. Data collection methods.
The coMforT (Mindfulness for Trauma) study ad-
dresses these areas of uncertainty through further inter-
vention development work with stakeholders followed
by feasibility testing of the refined intervention.
Methods/design
Study aim/objectives
The coMforT study aims to (i) produce a TI-MBCT pro-
gram that is acceptable to DVA survivors with PTSD
and feasible to deliver and (ii) establish the feasibility of
a definitive trial of a TI-MBCT intervention vs control
intervention for this population.
The objectives of the intervention development work
are to
1. Elicit service users ’and professional stakeholders ’
suggestions for recruitment and retention of DVA
survivors with PTSD and their uptake and
engagement with the prototype TI-MBCT
2. Elicit service users ’and professional stakeholders ’
suggestions for additional refinements of the
prototype TI-MBCT that will increase uptake and
engagement with the intervention.
3. Produce TI-MBCT manual for feasibility testing.
The objectives of the subsequent feasibility trial are to
1. Determine which psychological intervention
currently offered within the NHS IAPT service can
be used as control intervention in a definitive trial,
and explore the practicality of referring study
participants to this control intervention
2. Assess the feasibility of recruiting participants
through third sector organizations providing health
and social care to DVA victims and survivors
3. Evaluate the acceptability of randomization to
participants
4. Determine if it is possible to retain DVA survivors
with PTSD to follow-up
5. Refine the orientation process for the TI-MBCT
intervention
6. Examine if it is possible to enroll and retain DVA
survivors with PTSD in TI-MBCT groups
7. Evaluate the acceptability of the TI-MBCT inter-
vention to DVA survivors with PTSD
8. Determine the practicalities of delivering TI-MBCT
in the community setting
9. Produce TI-MBCT manual for the full-size trial
10. Examine the acceptability and completeness of the
data collection methods for a definitive trialPitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:33 Page 3 of 14
11. Estimate variance and distribution of quantitative
outcomes in the feasibility trial data to inform the
design and sample size calculation in the future
definitive trial.
A traffic light system will be used to review pro-
gression criteria to a full trial, whereby “green ”indi-
cates that it is feasible to conduct a definitive trial
with the current trial design and procedures, “amber ”
indicates that improvements are required before
conducting a definitive trial, and ‘red’indicates that it
is not feasible to progress to a definitive trial (see
Table 1). The independent study steering group will
be consulted about whether progressing to a definitive
trial is justified.
Study design
The study consists of two components: (1) refining the
prototype TI-MBCT and (2) conducting a feasibility trial
for an RCT for TI-MBCT for DVA survivors with
PTSD.Intervention refinement
The intervention refinement work is informed by the
Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the de-
velopment and evaluation of complex interventions [ 31,
32] and prior research in the field of developing psycho-
logical interventions [ 33–35]. This study component will
involve
1. An update of the 2014 literature review on adapting
mindfulness programs for PTSD and DVA
populations.
2. A qualitative study with women who have
experienced DVA and professionals about using
psychological interventions (including mindfulness-
based approaches) for the treatment of PTSD in this
population.
3. A consensus exercise with mindfulness experts on
areas of uncertainty regarding the proposed
adaptations to a standard MBCT program.
Findings from these three sources will be synthesized to
produce the TI-MBCT prototype 2 intervention which

will be tested and refined further in the subsequent feasi-
bility trial.
Feasibility trial
This study component comprises of a cycle of further
refinement of the prototype TI-MBCT intervention
through piloting and concurrent formativeprocess evaluation. The direct experience of delivering
and receiving the adapted TI-MBCT curriculum will
feed into further intervention refinement in an iterative
and systematic way. We will carry out a parallel-group,
individually randomized, 2-arm feasibility trial with an
embedded mixed-method process evaluation and eco-
nomic evaluation (see Fig. 1).

From the pool of service users in third sector DVA
agencies, women with PTSD will be recruited and ran-
domized (2:1 —intervention:control). The participants in
the intervention arm will take part in a group-based TI-
MBCT course and participants in the control arm will
be asked to self-refer through the IAPT service.
Participants will be followed up at 6 months post-
randomization. In the intervention arm, we will run two
consecutive TI-MBCT groups. The first group will re-
ceive the TI-MBCT prototype 2 produced through the
intervention development phase. At the end of the first
group, we will interview the participants to inform fur-
ther intervention refinement and produce the TI-MBCT
prototype 3 for the second intervention group. After the
second group, we will invite participants to take part in
further qualitative interviews, as part of a process evalu-
ation. Results of the feasibility trial and process evalu-
ation will inform a decision on progression to a full-size
trial. If we find that it is feasible and acceptable to pro-
gress (see Table 1), we will produce a final version of the
TI-MBCT manual for the full-size trial.
Study setting
The study will be based at the University of Bristol.
Intervention refinement
Women who have experienced DVA and professionals
will be recruited from non-NHS and NHS organizations,
not limited by location. Interviews will take place at a lo-
cation that is safe and convenient for both participant
and researcher. The consensus exercise will be held on
university premises.
Feasibility trial
Participants will be recruited from third sector DVA
agencies in two local authorities in the southwest of
England.
Study assessments and the TI-MBCT intervention
will be delivered at locations that are safe and conveni-
ent for both participants an d researchers, e.g., commu-
nity centers. The control intervention will be delivered
at NHS sites or non-NHS sites providing IAPT services
for PTSD. Importantly, the i ntervention sites will be in
geographical areas served by the participating third
sector organizations from which the participants were
recruited.
A safety protocol will be in place to protect the welfare
of women who have experienced DVA participating in
the trial. A safe method of contact will be agreed with
the researchers, interviews will take place in a place safe
for the researcher and participant, and under no circum-
stances will the researcher discuss any information with
another person known to the participant.Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria for the intervention refinement
process will be
Target population:
–Female
–18 years or older
–Self-identified as victims or survivors of any forms of
DVA
–Self-identified experience of mental health
problem(s) including PTSD.
NHS-employed and non-NHS employed professionals:
–Mental health care practitioners: mindfulness
practitioners and therapists with experience of
treating PTSD.
–DVA advocates from third sector organizations with
experience of working with people who have
experienced DVA and PTSD.
–Managers of NHS-based and non-NHS based ser-
vices for women who have experienced DVA.
The eligibility criteria for the feasibility trial will be
–Female
–18 years or older
–Accessed collaborating third sector organizations
providing health and social care to DVA victims and
survivors
–Clinically important symptoms of PTSD [ 21]
indicated by the baseline score above the clinical
threshold on the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-
PTSD-5). “Yes ”to any exposure to traumatic events
and “yes”to any three out of five items [ 36]
Women with and without children will be recruited to
explore the feasibility of measuring mother-reported
outcomes for children. If a woman has more than one
child aged 8-18, the study investigator will use random
number generation to select one child for the study to
reduce the response burden on the woman.
The exclusion criteria for the feasibility trial are cur-
rently based on the standard MBCT guidance [ 37]; mea-
sures are summarized in Table 2:
–Unable to provide written informed consent
–Unable to speak and understand English (because
interventions will be delivered in English)
–Current drug or alcohol dependency (the full
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
score ≥20, the Drug Use Disorders Identification
Test (DUDIT) score ≥25)
–Organic brain damagePitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:33 Page 6 of 14
–Current or past psychosis
–Current persistent self-harm or suicide risk
–Already receiving psychological therapy
The inclusion/exclusion criteria for the feasibility trial
will be revised and amended as necessary through the
intervention refinement work.
Sample size
Intervention refinement
The number of qualitative interviews conducted with
women who have experienced DVA and professionals
will be determined by the point at which thematic satur-
ation is achieved, where further interviews are notexpected to add additional information to the themes
generated during the concurrent analysis. This is likely
to include between 20 and 30 participants.
Feasibility trial
The required sample size is based on the precision for
estimating the proportion (30%) of eligible participants
consenting to participate in the study. If 120 eligible
women are screened, then a true recruitment rate of
30% (= 36 recruits) will be estimated as between 21.8
and 38.2%, with 95% probability. This estimate is based
on a previous trial that successfully recruited women
from one of the collaborating DVA services [ 27,52].

for women who have experienced DVA [ 27,28]u pt o
33% of the consented and randomized participants are
expected to drop out before the start of the mindfulness
group/control intervention. Therefore, 54 will be ran-
domized in order to be left with 36 who will be allocated
to the intervention or control arm. We will compare the
rate of drop out before starting mindfulness/control in-
terventions between the two arms of the trial.
Retention will be optimized using established methods
for trials involving women who have experienced DVA,
[53–55] further modified through previous research in
the UK context [ 56,51], which resulted in 70 –81% re-
tention rates. The methods include maintaining a safe
contact list, reimbursement for travel, childcare and £20
shopping voucher for each treatment session attended.
Recruitment and consent
Intervention refinement
Women who have experienced DVA and professional
stakeholders will be recruited through existing profes-
sional networks, previous study databases, and snowbal-
ling techniques. Participants will be sent the participant
information sheet and consent form in advance, and
written, or verbal, informed consent will be recorded.
Feasibility trial
Participants will be recruited through convenience sam-
pling from a pool of service users in collaborating third
sector organizations providing health and social care to
DVA victims and survivors. The participants will be re-
cruited in cohorts during a 2-month time-frames prior
pre-scheduled TI-MBCT group dates:
–Near the time of exit from the service, support
workers will approach women at individual sessions
with study information and invitations
–Group work facilitators will approach women at the
end of the group with study information and
invitations
–After women exit the service, support workers will
approach them during a 6-month follow-up phone
call with study information and invitations
–Invitations will be sent to women from the waiting
list of the agency services.
All service users undergo risk assessment within the
service by their support workers. Support workers will
carry out initial screening (Table 2). Those meeting the cri-
teria and willing to be contacted by the study researcher
will be referred to the study for final screening (Table 2).
Participants will receive the participant information
sheet and consent form in advance, and the study re-
searcher will obtain informed written consent.Randomization will be independent of the study re-
searcher. Once informed consent has been secured
and baseline data has been collected, the researcher
will telephone a remote randomization service at the
Bristol Randomised Trial Collaboration (BRTC) to as-
certain the participant allocation: either to the inter-
vention arm (mindfulness) or control arm (IAPT) in a
2:1 ratio, so that each participant has a 2/3rd ’s
probability of receiving the mindfulness intervention.
The participant will be informed which arm she is
assigned to by the researcher. Randomization will
happen in blocks of 6. For every 18 participants that
are randomized, we anticipate that six will drop out
before the start of the intervention, four will continue
in the study as controls and e ight will continue in the
study in the intervention arm —this will be sufficient
to run a mindfulness group.
Allocation concealment will be achieved using the
remote randomization service acting as a “third
party ”to assign the participant to either intervention
or control arms. This ensures that the study re-
searcher, enrolling and consenting participants, can-
not be influenced by knowledge of their expected
allocation at this stage. Once the participant has
been allocated to either the intervention or the con-
trol arm, this assignment will be made available to
the researcher. This is to enable the participant ’sd e -
tails to be passed onto the mindfulness teacher if
they are in the intervention arm. The mindfulness
teacher will invite the prosp ective intervention par-
ticipants to an orientation meeting followed by an
individual telephone assessment. Those participants
randomized to the control arm will be advised by
the study investigator how to self-refer to the IAPT
service and helped with the self-referral if needed
and wanted.
Due to the psychological nature of the intervention in
both trial arms, it will not be possible to blind partici-
pants to details of which arm they have been allocated.
Due to funding limitations, the same study researcher
will carry out recruitment, baseline, and follow-up as-
sessments, and monthly check-up calls; therefore, it will
not be possible to blind the study investigator to the
treatment groups. All process evaluation and analysis
will be conducted by a different researcher blind to the
participation group.
Interventions
Intervention arm: TI-MBCT
The intervention will be group-based TI-MBCT de-
veloped through the intervention refinement phase
of the study (see Table 3). The focus of this inter-
vention is creating a new relationship with trauma-Pitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:33 Page 8 of 14
related phenomena and learning how to respond
when the trauma of the past shows up in the
present. TI-MBCT addresses the re-experiencing and
reactivity characteristic of people who have experi-
enced DVA with PTSD through the gradual develop-
ment of skills for “de-centering ”from distress.
Instead of avoiding or becoming overwhelmed by
distressing thoughts, powerful impulses, intense feel-
ings, and disturbing body sensations, participants
gradually learn to approach such experiences without
judgment and with more acceptance and to gently
ask “given that this experience is happening right
now, how can I best take care of myself? ”The culti-
vation of a non-judgemental attitude to what is
arising in the present moment enables a way of
responding, rather than reacting, to the self whentrauma-related distress is experienced. In addition,
being part of a group allows for a recognition that
distress arising from past abuse is a shared experi-
ence, which reduces the sense of identification with
being “damaged ”that many people who have experi-
enced DVA feel (Millband S.: How can an adapted
MBCT course meet the speci fic vulnerabilities of
women survivors of domestic violence and abuse?
Unpublished thesis: Bangor University; 2015).
Control arm
Participants in the control group will be self-referred to
the local IAPT service. Participants accessing the IAPT
service receive an initial telephone assessment, after
which they are offered different forms of therapy, based
on the nature and severity of their symptoms and theTable 3 TI-MBCT intervention overview

What The manual, mindfulness practices and exercises for TI-MBCT will be developed through the intervention refinement process.
Who provided An experienced mindfulness teacher with expertise in trauma, who is in supervision with a mindfulness-based supervisor with
expertise in trauma.
How TI-MBCT delivered in face-to-face groups of up to nine participants
Where A site will be selected which is safe and convenient for both participants and the therapist (e.g., community centre).
When and how
muchOnce a week for eight weeks participants will attend a 2-h session and conduct 45 min of guided home practice.
Tailoring The intervention will be refined to meet the needs of women with DVA trauma with a particular emphasis on establishing a
sense of safety from which to turn towards challenging experiences.
Modifications TI-MBCT will be refined during the study based on evidence synthesis from
1. A literature review on trauma-sensitive adaptations of mindfulness-based interventions
2. Qualitative interviews with women who have experienced DVA (including feasibility trial participants) and professional
stakeholders
3. Consensus exercise with “experts by experience ”of delivering mindfulness-based interventions to participants who have
experienced trauma.
How well
Planned
ActualTherapists ’records will be analysed to measure intervention uptake, retention and dose received.
Home practice records completed by participants will be analysed to measure dose received.
A standard tool for assessing fidelity of a mindfulness-based intervention [ 60] will be adapted to the TI-MBCT course and tested
in the feasibility trial.

Table 4 Feasibility outcomes
Outcome Description; measure
Recruitment/
randomization rateProportion of participants randomized into two arms; the denominator will be the number of participants eligible for
recruitment/randomization
Intervention uptake Proportion of participants who took up the TI-MBCT or self-referred to the IAPT service; the denominator will be the
number of participants randomized in the arm, respectively.
Intervention retention Proportion of participants in the intervention arm who received the “minimum dose ”of the intervention, four sessions of
mindfulness intervention [ 29].
Follow-up rate Proportion of participants followed up and providing outcome data at six months post-randomization out of those en
rolled in the trial. The proportion who have been lost to follow-up will also be calculated by the trial arms.

availability of practitioners. At 6-month follow-up, we
will collect IAPT data regarding each control partici-
pant ’s individual care pathway to understand what
psychological intervention(s) are provided as usual care.
Outcomes and measures
The outcome of the intervention refinement component
will be stakeholder views on the content and format for
the TI-MBCT refinement obtained through semi-
structured qualitative interviews.
Feasibility outcomes
Table 4summarizes feasibility outcomes that will be
used in the feasibility trial to evaluate the feasibility of a
future full-size trial.
Intervention impact outcomes
Trial participants will complete standardized vali-
dated and bespoke questionnaires at baseline and 6-
month face-to-face meetings with study researcher
(Table 2). If we find that it is feasible and acceptable
to collect the intervention impact data, these out-
comes will be used in a full-size trial. The primary
outcome will be clinically important symptoms of
PTSD [ 21] captured by self-administered PTSD
Checklist for DSM-V (PCL-5) [ 44] and International
Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) [ 45]. Secondary out-
comes will include the severity of dissociative symp-
t o m s ,d e p r e s s i o n ,a n x i e t y ,D V Ar e - v i c t i m i z a t i o n ,s e l f -
compassion, and woman reported child health and
wellbeing.
Economic measures
A resource use data collection form will be developed
for the trial, informed by that used in the Psychological
Advocacy Towards Healing trial [ 56]. EQ-5D-5L will be
used to collect data on participant health-related quality
of life [ 50]. Responses will be converted to utility scores
using the standard UK tariff values and this used to esti-
mate quality-adjusted life years.
Data collection methods
Intervention refinement
Qualitative data will be collected during semi-structured
interviews with stakeholder professionals and women
who have experienced DVA. Researchers will collect
brief sociodemographic data (professional role/employ-
ment status, age, gender, ethnicity) at the outset, then
use flexible topic guides to ensure primary issues are
covered during each interview. Topic guides will be
modified as necessary to address emerging findings and
new lines of enquiry. A participant distress protocol will
guide researchers during interviews about how to re-
spond if participants become distressed during or afterthe interviews. Researchers will be supervised and have
access to debriefing following participant interviews.
Feasibility trial
Data regarding feasibility will be obtained from study
logs of recruitment and follow-up, therapists ’records
about intervention uptake/sessions attended, retention
and dose received, and interviews with participants
about the acceptability of the intervention and trial de-
sign. Clinical data will be collected at face-to-face meet-
ings with the researcher using the standardized validated
questionnaires listed above. Economic data will be
collated from the study logs detailing the cost of
intervention delivery. Self-reported economic measures
will be collected from participants 6 months post-
randomization using paper-based, self-completed, and
interviewer-assisted questionnaires.
Data analysis
Qualitative analysis
Interview audio-recordings will be professionally tran-
scribed and imported into NVivo software for line-by-
line coding. The framework method [ 62] will be used to
analyze the data in order to identify themes across the
dataset, using constant comparison techniques. A second
researcher will be involved in coding and reviewing
themes. Data from the feasibility trial will first be ana-
lyzed as two separate data sets (intervention and control
arms) to look at common themes within each arm, be-
fore making analytic comparisons across the data sets.
Data will be explored for disconfirming cases within and
across the arms of the study.
Data will be analyzed at two time points; initially after
the first intervention group, in order to inform any fur-
ther refinements of the prototype and subsequently, after
the second intervention group to make comparisons
across the two groups and time points, in terms of deliv-
ery and content of the intervention and the control
group experience.
Quantitative analysis
Since this is a feasibility trial, the statistical analyses are
mainly descriptive. We will calculate rates with 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs). Medians (ranges) will be calcu-
lated for ordinal data, means with standard deviations
(SD) for continuous data, and raw counts (number, %)
for nominal data. Differences in means (and 95% confi-
dence intervals) between the two study arms will be pre-
sented for the various outcome scales, but no pvalues
will be displayed. The SD of the outcome measures will
be used to help inform a sample size calculation for a
full trial.Pitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:33 Page 10 of 14
Economic evaluation
The aim of the economic analysis is to inform the design
of economic evaluation in the full-scale trial. The feasi-
bility trial will be used to determine the optimal perspec-
tive, type of economic evaluation, scope, and data
collection methods. The research team will design data
collection tools, aiming to minimize missing data and
identify relevant unit costs and the main cost drivers.
The costs of the intervention and the control treatment
will be crucial. An aim will be to establish how best to
collect the data and how to value it.
Descriptive statistics will be reported for all quantita-
tive and economic data collected. Missing data will be
examined between baseline and follow-up interviews
and prior to a full trial, with a view to establishing causes
of missing data and how these might be addressed.
Withdrawal criteria
Participants may withdraw because they no longer wish
to attend the intervention or control therapy or assess-
ment meetings or because a change in their health status
or personal circumstances warrants their withdrawal.
Researchers will attempt to contact participants up to
three times using different modalities (e.g., text, email,
and phone), before deeming them to be lost to follow-
up. Data obtained up to the point of withdrawal will be
anonymized and retained for analysis. Participants who
have withdrawn or dropped out of the study will be con-
tacted once by telephone and asked if they would agree
to answer some questions to explore the reasons for
their non-participation. This will be explained in the
participant information sheet and consent form.
It is hoped that participants withdrawing from the
intervention or control arm would remain willing to par-
ticipate in follow-up measurements at 6 months; all par-
ticipants withdrawing from the intervention/control
phase will be approached once at the 6-month point, but
contact will not be pursued if participants either (i) indi-
cate that they do not wish to complete the follow-up
stage or (ii) do not respond.
In the circumstance that a participant wishes to with-
draw from the trial and therapy completely, they will no
longer receive contact from the mindfulness teacher (if
in the intervention arm), or from the IAPT therapist (if
in the control arm) and will not be contacted about
follow-up research appointments.
Data management
Quantitative data will be entered in REDCap software.
STATA will be used to conduct statistical analyses and
produce graphs. Qualitative interviews will be audio-
recorded on a University of Bristol approved encrypted
digital recorder, transcribed, and analyzed in NVivo soft-
ware. Information collected by the mindfulness teacher/IAPT therapist about the progression of the intervention
will be recorded separately in the teacher/therapist log-
book, and in pre-specified tables and worksheets.
We will follow the University of Bristol Data Protec-
tion Policy built on the General Data Protection Regula-
tion. Personal data will be kept in a secure place —
electronically in the study folder on the departmental file
store with password-protected access and hard copies in
a locked cabinet in a locked room on secure university
premises. Personal data and an anonymization log will
be kept separately from research data, and participants
will be identifiable by study ID.
After the study has concluded, we will deposit the
anonymized data in the University of Bristol Data Re-
pository. Analyzed data will be retained for a minimum
of 10 years.
Study organization and management
The sponsor (University of Bristol) and funders (see
below) had no role in the design of this study and will
play no role in its conduct, data analysis, and interpret-
ation, manuscript writing, or dissemination of results.
The sponsor and funder will not control the final deci-
sion regarding any of these aspects of the study. The
study management group (SMG) will assist the principal
investigator in the day-to-day management of the project
and meet monthly. A joint study steering committee and
data monitoring and ethics committee (SSC/DMEC) of
independent experts in DVA, PTSD, mindfulness, and
statistics will act as an advisory group. The study is con-
ducted in collaboration with a patient and public in-
volvement (PPI) group consisting of women who have
experienced DVA, who will advise on study materials
and processes.
The study is conducted in accordance with the Re-
search Governance Framework for Health and Social
Care and Good Clinical Practice. The study will be mon-
itored and audited in accordance with sponsor policies.
All feasibility trial-related documents will be made avail-
able on request for monitoring and audit. Amendments
to the protocol will be submitted to the Research Ethics
Committee for approval.
Adverse event reporting
All adverse events will be reported from the time the
participant is enrolled in the feasibility trial until com-
pletion of the last study-related procedure. The research
team will collect data on adverse events from study par-
ticipants, researchers, and interventionists. Participants
will be asked about adverse events at least every 30 days.
If an adverse event were to occur, the study investigator
or a delegated member of the study team would assess
whether the event is serious or unexpected, and whether
it is likely to be related to the study procedures orPitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:33 Page 11 of 14
interventions. All adverse events will be recorded in the
study file with a note that will identify when the event
occurred, what happened, any potential study relation,
action taken and resolution/closure of the adverse event.
All serious adverse events will be reported to the Univer-
sity of Bristol research governance and ethics officer,
who will notify the relevant Research Ethics Committee,
the Insurance Office and the Research Governance
Team as appropriate.

Discussion
DVA is common and destructive to health. PTSD is a
major mental health consequence. Existing treatments
for PTSD are often limited by high levels of discontinu-
ation [ 23]. Women who have experienced DVA have
specific needs because the trauma they have experienced
is often recurrent and complex. NICE have called for re-
search into psychological interventions for people who
have experienced DVA [ 24]. Evidence is emerging that
mindfulness-based therapies may benefit trauma symp-
toms [ 26]. However, research is needed to indicate
whether TI-MBCT can be adapted to meet the needs of
people who have experienced DVA with PTSD.An evidence-based approach to intervention develop-
ment and feasibility testing, based on co-production with
stakeholders and iterative cycles of intervention refine-
ment informed by process evaluation, may help to im-
prove the acceptability of the intervention. Feasibility
testing is important to this study, to address areas of un-
certainty highlighted during intervention development.
This includes the feasibility of recruiting DVA survivors
to a group based psychological intervention and ways to
optimize retention of this vulnerable population. The
feasibility trial will allow researchers to assess the ac-
ceptability of randomizing participants and to clarify
what treatment DVA survivors with PTSD are offered
through the IAPT service.
DVA survivors with PTSD remain a group with unmet
needs. The development of the TI-MBCT intervention
and progression of the feasibility trial to full trial will
contribute to the therapy evidence base for this
population.
