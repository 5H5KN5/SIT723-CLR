Behaviour Centred Design: towards an applied science of
behaviour change

ABSTRACT
Behaviour change has become a hot topic. We describe a new approach,
Behaviour Centred Design (BCD), which encompasses a theory of change,
a suite of behavioural determinants and a programme design process. The
theory of change is generic, assuming that successful interventions mustcreate a cascade of effects via environments, through brains, to
behaviour and hence to the desired impact, such as improved health.
Changes in behaviour are viewed as the consequence of a
reinforcement learning process involving the targeting of evolved
motives and changes to behaviour settings, and are produced by threetypes of behavioural control mechanism (automatic, motivated and
executive). The implications are that interventions must create surprise,
revalue behaviour and disrupt performance in target behaviour settings.
We then describe a sequence of five steps required to design an
intervention to change specific behaviours: Assess, Build, Create, Deliverand Evaluate. The BCD approach has been shown to change hygiene,
nutrition and exercise-related behaviours and has the advantages of
being applicable to product, service or institutional design, as well as
being able to incorporate future developments in behaviour science. We
therefore argue that BCD can become the foundation for an appliedscience of behaviour change.ARTICLE HISTORY

Behaviour change is currently a hot topic. Professionals including policy-makers, marketers, edu-
cationalists, environmentalists, international development practitioners, governance and justice cam-
paigners, health promoters, city planners, sports psychologists and web designers, as well asindividuals seeking to improve their own lives, are all looking for advice on how to change behaviour.
However, there are myriad ideas about how to go about it. Health promotion, for example, has a long
tradition of theorising the problem, based mainly in cognitive psychology (e.g., Ajzen, 1991 ; Bandura,
1986 ; Becker, 1974 ; Michie, Stralen, & West, 2011 ; Mosler, 2012 ; Schwarzer, 2008 ). More recently,
behavioural economists have demonstrated a variety of ways of changing behaviour using specificaspects of human decision-making (Anand & Lea, 2011 ; Ariely, 2009 ; Sunstein & Thaler, 2008 ).
Marketing and design professionals also have practical techniques for creating sales, advertising
and new products (Brown, 2009 ). Each of these distinct fields has its own theoretical foundations
and standards of practice. But despite calls for more cross-disciplinary learning and greater
integration (e.g., http://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange/index (Rowson, 2011 )), and the
initiation of new journals, university departments and centres devoted to behaviour change

(e.g., http://www.mdrc.org/project/center-applied-behavioral-science-cabs#overview ), a fully-fledged
applied science of behaviour change has yet to emerge.
An applied science needs both science and application . First, it has to be able to stay current with,
and incorporate, the latest thinking in relevant scientific disciplines, and, second, it needs access to
the latest and best tools for applying this knowledge to real-world problems. In the case of behaviourchange, the relevant scientific disciplines include the burgeoning field of the brain and behavioural
sciences, as well as the social and ecological sciences. Practical tools for applying this science to
behavioural problems are to be found in many places including in industry (in creative and PRagencies, with professional designers and marketers), in public sector organisations and, to a
lesser extent, in academia. Unifying such diverse material requires a generic framework.
In this paper, we introduce a generic approach to behaviour change called Behaviour Centred
Design (BCD). The BCD framework offers both a theory of change for behaviour (De Silva et al.,2014 ; Retolaza, 2011 ; Vogel, 2012 ), and a practical process for designing and evaluating interventions.
Theories of change are increasingly used to facilitate programme design because they force program-
mers to make explicit claims about the cause –effect relationships that follow from an intervention,
together with the assumptions underlying such claims. Analysis then allows programme stakeholdersto attribute results to programme activities, even in complex contexts. The BCD theory of changeincorporates some of the latest developments in behavioural science, including reinforcement learn-
ing (RL) theory (Sutton & Barto, 1998 ), the evolution of behavioural control (Aunger & Curtis, 2015 ), the
evolved structure of human motivation (Aunger & Curtis, 2013 ) and a revised version of behaviour set-
tings theory (Barker, 1968 ). It also sets out a practical five-step process for designing and evaluating
interventions. This process incorporates a novel approach to formative research (FR), applies design
thinking and professional creativity to intervention production, and relies on academic best practicefor process and impact evaluation. A fundamental tenet of BCD is its single-minded focus on behav-
iour in its physical, social, biological and temporal context. We suggest that following the five-step
BCD process should lead to novel, creative and sustainable solutions, as well as to the accumulationof learning about what works, thus contributing to a progressive applied science of behaviour change.
BCD has been applied successfully to behaviours ranging from handwashing, to oral rehydration,
food hygiene, child and maternal nutrition, and post-operative exercise (Biran et al., 2014 ; Doyle,
2015 ; Gautam & Curtis, 2016 ; Greenland, 2015 ). It has been used in the design and marketing of bath-
room, soap and food products and is currently being applied to new challenges such as creatingdemand for sanitation and HIV prophylaxis. Below, we first set out the components of the BCDtheory of change, then the practical steps in its application, using the context of a large-scale
public health behaviour change programme. We finish with a discussion of its limitations and
possibilities.
Behaviour Centred Design
The BCD framework is set out in Figure 1 . The theory of change is depicted across the middle, with the
ABCDE steps of the design process wrapped around the outside (in blue).
Theory of change
The BCD theory of change sets out the minimum chain of causes and effects that must occur forbehaviour to change, so as to produce the desired impact. Reading from the left, the task is to
design an intervention that can produce changes to the environment, which causes changes in
the brains of the target audience, which, in turn, cause them to behave differently. The consequencesof behaviour are changes in some state-of-the-world, such as better health, community solidarity or
company profits. This causal sequence is shared by a variety of prominent approaches including
expectancy value theory (which underlies approaches such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour(Ajzen, 1991 )), learning theories such as the Antecedent-Behaviour-Consequence Model426 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
(Miltenberger, 2011 ), and communication-based behaviour change approaches (Figueroa, Kincaid,
Rani, & Lewis, 2002 ; Finnegan Jr & Viswanath, 2002 ; Graeff, Elder, & Mills Booth, 1993 ).1Indeed, it
is possible to replace the brain box in the BCD theory of change with the more specific theoretical
claims of many of the prominent health psychological approaches, as most consist of structural
models of the relationships between particular psychological constructs such as subjective norms,intention, self-efficacy and coping planning.
Design process
The second component of BCD, the five-step intervention design process, is shown around theoutside of the theory of change. First is the Assess step, where what is known about the target behav-
iour and its likely determinants in specific contexts is gathered together and a theory of change is
drafted. In the Build step, FR fills in knowledge gaps and builds the hypothetical theory of change.The C step concerns a Creative process where insights derived from the A and B steps are used to
develop the intervention, preferably with the help of creative professionals. In the Deliver step, the
intervention is set up and rolled out to the target population, and in the final, E step, the interventionis Evaluated both for its outcomes and for its process, again following the expected theory of change.
Our five steps are based on the design thinking process, particularly as proposed by Herbert Simon
inThe Science of the Artificial (Simon, 1969 ).
2This model has been taken up by engineers (Plattner,
2009 ), design firms (Brown, 2009 ), academics (Andreasen & Hein, 1987 ; Booz, Allen, & Hamilton
Inc., 1982 ) and more recently in business service, web-page, architectural and organisational
design (Van Wulfen, 2013 ). It is also similar, but not equivalent, to the processes used in personnel
training (e.g., the U.S Army ADDIE model (Branson et al., 1975 )), humanitarian responses (e.g., the
UN OCHA model (Anonymous, 2014)), social marketing (Andreason, 2006 ), organisational capacity-
building (e.g., the UNDP model (Anonymous, 2008 )), software design (Gremba & Myers, 1997 ), and
in public health programmes (e.g., the PRECEDE-PROCEED model (Green & Kreuter, 1991 ), the MRC
complex interventions framework (Anderson, 2008 ) and Intervention Mapping (Bartholomew
Eldredge et al., 2016 )). Each of these approaches has some steps in common, but are not always
clear about the minimum steps needed. Behavioural economists focus more on evaluation than
Figure 1. Behaviour Centred Design.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 427
on the design of interventions, whilst marketing efforts often omit evaluation. Public health program-
mers, in particular, often do not include a Create step; the MRC framework, for example, does notspecify the need for FR or creative intervention design. What makes all of the BCD steps necessary
is that each has a unique function, and requires a specific expertise –A: research, B: field-based
data collection, C: creativity, D: implementation logistics and E: evaluative analysis. The steps are
also sufficient, in that a project which does not include all of them is likely to be less effective.
The BCD theory of change
The BCD theory of change requires that a specific sequence of causes and effects occur as a result of aprogramme intervention. This cascade is underpinned by a single, fundamental theory of thedynamics of behaviour change: RL. RL is now the dominant paradigm in neuroscience, psychology,
robotics and organisational management for explaining how feedback from interactions with the
environment shapes brains and hence behaviour (Alija, 2010 ; Botvinick, Niv, & Barto, 2009 ; DeWitt,
2014 ; Doll, Simon, & Daw, 2012 ; Niv, Edlund, Dayan, & O ’Doherty, 2012 ; Sutton & Barto, 1998 ).
In the basic RL model, an agent (animal or robot) interacts with its environment through two chan-
nels: perception and action. At each step of interaction, the agent receives a perceptual input as anindication of the current state of the environment. The agent then chooses (perhaps subconsciously)
an action to generate as its behavioural response to that situation. This action changes the state of
the environment, which is again perceived, and the value of this change is returned to the agentthrough a reinforcement signal, or reward. The classic example is a mouse in a laboratory maze.
The mouse can smell a piece of cheese, but needs to choose one of two paths to reach it. If the
mouse chooses the correct path, moving along that path produces a positive cheese smell gradient,with the value of each forward motion being returned to the mouse as a positive reinforcement
signal or reward. The mouse therefore continues to the cheese, which it begins to eat, triggering a
further dopaminergic signal of reward.
Our agent thus learns to repeat action-sequences that tend to increase the sum of values associated
with the environmental changes it creates through action (Kaebling, Littman, & Moore, 1996 ) (techni-
cally, learning –or brain changes –are caused by a signal that indicates an unexpected level of reward
from the behaviour, or a revised assessment of the value of its response (O ’Doherty, Dayan, Friston,
Critchley, & Dolan, 2003 ; Schultz, 2013 )). If successful, our agent will find a policy that maps environ-
mental states to the actions that maximise long-term total reward. RL thus links how environmentalchanges (for example, placing cheese in a supermarket aisle) produce new brain-states (via reward-
based learning), which in turn, lead to changes in behaviour (choice of pathway), in a well-validated
dynamic model. BCD uses RL as the natural foundation for its theory of change.
Behaviour –state-of-the-world link
We now describe the individual links in the BCD theory of change and their scientific underpinnings.
We start from the right, the desired final impact, and work backwards to the inputs that are required
to drive the cascade of change. First, we look at behaviour and how it affects health (the state-of-the-world on which we concentrate here).
The BCD approach, as its name suggests, focuses squarely on behaviour. From an evolutionary
perspective, behaviour is the quintessential adaptation of animals, representing their main distinctionfrom plants (Aunger & Curtis, 2015 ). Behaviour is a functional interaction between a body and its
environment, designed to help an organism to get what it needs to survive and reproduce(Aunger & Curtis, 2008 ). In public health practice, the aim is typically to change specific behaviours
that are risk factors for ill-health. However, if it is true that behaviour has been designed by evolution
to maximise biological fitness, as we argue, why is it that some behaviours are apparently maladap-
tive –that is, they cause ill-health at a population level? Surely such behaviours should have been
removed from the human repertoire by natural selection.428 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
There are many reasons why current human behaviour does not always optimise health. First, the
choice of one behavioural strategy always comes at a cost to another, due to trade-offs (Henderson,
2008 ). For example, behaviours that maximise reproductive success, but jeopardise health, may have
been positively selected, such as when adolescent males indulge in risky behaviours to impresspotential mates (Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999 ). Another important reason for contemporary
unhealthy behaviour is ‘ecological mismatch ’: human behaviour evolved to maximise survival and
reproduction in our ancestral environments, but most of us now live in a highly techno-enhancedworld (Curtis & Aunger, 2011 ; Eaton et al., 2002 ; Nesse & Williams, 1998 ). In contemporary life, indi-
viduals can meet basic needs with minimal effort: calories are cheap, work and entertainment are
sedentary, novel technologies such as cigarettes, refined sugars, cars and winter sports are highly
reinforced through reward, but have negative side-effects. Recent technological advance offersattractive, but unhealthy, new products and lifestyles. Further, beneficial novel behaviours using tech-
nologies such as vaccines, soap or medication are not learnt because their use is not sufficiently
rewarding (Hall & Fong, 2007 ). Thus, although most human activity is ‘naturally ’healthy, certain beha-
viours are sub-optimal from a health point of view, and require programmatic assistance.
For a programme to be effective, it is essential that the behaviours most responsible for causing
some undesirable state-of-the-world (e.g., a prevalent health problem) be identified with precision.Whilst the definition of the responsible behaviour may be obvious (e.g., due to a long history of epi-
demiological investigation), identifying the exact behaviour to target can sometimes be problematic.
For example, it can be hard to pinpoint which specific child feeding practices are responsible for highlevels of stunting or obesity. Judgments often have to be made as to the precise behavioural target
based on best available –but incomplete –evidence (Curtis et al., 2011 ).
Brain –behaviour link
The next link in the theory of change is that between behaviour and brains. The two are intimately
linked because the brain is an organ designed by evolution to produce adaptive behaviour (Aunger &
Curtis, 2015 ; Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992 ; Freeman, 1999 ; Hebb, 1949 ; Llinas, 2002 ; Swanson, 2003 ).
Figure 1 indicates how the brain resides within a body, which actually executes behaviour. Feedback
from the body in the form of sensation or perception is the brain ’s sole form of input, and the body
has its own physiological and metabolic needs with which the brain must be concerned, so bodies
have important influences on behaviour as well (Cisek & Pastor-Bernier, 2014 ; Glenberg, 2010 ; Lakoff
& Johnson, 1999 ; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991 ).
Over their long evolutionary history, human brains have acquired three distinct mechanisms for
controlling behaviour, each of which can be isolated neuroscientifically (Daw, Gershman, Seymour,Dayan, & Dolan, 2011 ; Daw, Niv, & Dayan, 2005 ; Dayan, Niv, Seymour, & D Daw, 2006 ; Rolls, 1999 ; Wun-
derlich, Dayan, & Dolan, 2012 ). These are the reactive, motivated and executive behaviour control
systems (Aunger & Curtis, 2015 ). Behaviour change research has largely concentrated on executive
(or cognitive) control of behaviour. For example, studies show that intentions have some limited
effects on behaviour (Webb & Sheeran, 2006 ), and that goal monitoring promotes goal attainment
(Harkin et al., 2016 ). Executive control is undoubtedly important in some types of behaviour
change, however, its importance may be overstated because of a failure to distinguish other formsof mental control over behaviour production. Health psychologists now acknowledge that there is
a second type of control, ‘non-conscious decision-making processes ’(Sheeran, Gollwitzer, & Bargh,
2013 ). We maintain that subconscious, short-term motivated goal-achievement is a third, important,
but often ignored, form of behavioural control.
Reactive behaviour
The most basic and the oldest control system, evolutionarily speaking, is reactive, having arisen ininvertebrates, but persisting in all animals ancestral to, and including, humans. When environmentalstimuli representing opportunities or threats are perceived, reactive mechanisms produce almostHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 429
instantaneous behavioural responses –often without conscious awareness. Examples include a flinch
in response to contact with a flame or a learned automatism, such as changing gear while driving up
a hill. Automatisms learned through repeated experience are called habits (Neal, Wood, & Quinn,
2006 ). Many health-related behaviours, such as hygiene routines or taking medicines, are produced
reactively in this way (Ouellette & Wood, 1998 ). Habits are created through repeated episodes of RL in
which learning gradually stops because the level of reward becomes predictable; indeed, perform-ance continues even in the face of temporary loss of rewards (Everitt & Robbins, 2005 ). A behaviour
change programmer may thus seek to create a habit by engendering the repetition of rewarding
behaviour within regularly occurring routines in constant settings.
Motivated behaviour
The second type of behaviour to evolve (first in bony fish) was motivated behaviour (Aunger & Curtis,2015 ). Motivation directs behaviour towards the achievement of evolutionarily beneficial goals. A
species ’way of life involves having to solve specific kinds of evolutionary problems, which are set
by its niche. For example, humans have tasks such as finding food, a long-term mate, and ensuringthat we are treated fairly in social dealings. Psychological mechanisms, called motives, evolved tohelp us to choose the appropriate behavioural response to achieve such goals reliably –that is,
the response that has been most likely over evolutionary time-scales to lead to a satisfactoryoutcome, as measured in terms of survival and reproduction (Aunger & Curtis, 2008 ,2013 ,2015 ;
Kenrick, Griskevicius, Neuberg, & Schaller, 2010 ). As we have discussed, the reward system provides
real-time indicators of progress towards, and achievement of goals and RL teaches us to repeatrewarding behaviour (and to avoid the opposite) (Arias-Carrión & Pöppel, 2007 ; Glimcher & Fehr,
2013 ; Schultz, 2006 ). Motives are the mental mechanisms that evolved to produce this goal-directed
behaviour.
In particular, the human way of life requires us to solve 15 different kinds of evolutionary puzzles
(Aunger & Curtis, 2013 ). For example, we are motivated to give a present to our mate because it may
help to keep them around to help rear dependent children (pair-bond Love), to take free offers, evenfor things that we do not need (the Hoard motive), to work to advance our acceptance by the group(Affiliation), or our social standing (Status), or to avoid threats of predation and accidents (Fear).
Figure 2 shows the point in human evolution at which each motive appeared (as new evolutionary
Figure 2. The human motives.430 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
tasks became part of the life-way), and the kind of function each motive performs (i.e., to improve the
brain ’s knowledge of the world, to improve the state of the external world itself, or to ensure that the
body can keep producing adaptive behaviours).
Each of these motives helped our ancestors to survive and compete in our evolutionary past. The
behaviour change task is thus to identify the motives that can be associated with the target behav-iour so as to make it more rewarding, hence causing RL, and so making its repeat more likely.
Planning and executive control
Finally, mammals, and particularly higher primates, evolved a third means of producing behaviour:
they use executive control to plan beyond the time horizon of immediate reactivity and short-to-
medium term goals. Mammals can consciously imagine alternative futures, evaluate which arelikely to be most beneficial over even very long-term horizons (still valued in terms of reward) and
hence plan to do something even more beneficial. For example, they can save grains to use for
seed, rather than eating them immediately, or sacrifice the opportunity of an extra-pair mating byimagining the consequences for their family –both of which may have greater payoffs in the long
run. Most efforts at behaviour change have focused on addressing this deliberative brain, on theassumption that it is primarily responsible for our behaviour. However, evidence now suggeststhat this part of the brain is reserved only for particular and unusual types of situations (Wilson,
2004 ). Most behavioural production is, in fact, carried out elsewhere, in the reflexive and motivated
behaviour control systems. BCD therefore focuses effort at uncovering reactive and motivated pro-
cesses, most of which are likely to be beyond the reach of conscious reflection.
The three different levels of control of behaviour in brains thus offer three distinct routes to encou-
rage behaviour to change. Examples can be provided from programmes targeting increases in hand-washing with soap. Target individuals can be helped to form a habit (reactive control) by placing
painted cues to handwashing outside school toilets (Dreibelbis, Kroeger, Hossain, Venkatesh, &
Ram, 2016 ); making hospital rooms smell of lemon can stimulate motivated efforts by caretakers
to keep themselves clean (Birnbach, King, Vlaev, Rosen, & Harvey, 2013 ), or individuals can be encour-
aged to form plans (executive control) by being reminded of the health benefits of handwashing(Curtis, Danquah, & Aunger, 2009 ). All three levels of behavioural control may also be required
sequentially as part of an overall strategy. For example, an intervention may seek to inspire conscious
decisions to become a non-smoker, to motivate individuals to reorganise their daily activities such
that they avoid situations where social demands to smoke will be placed on them, and suggest modi-fications to their domestic environment such that they force themselves into new habits to replace
practices when smoking would otherwise occur. The strategy that is chosen will need to be specified
in the programme ’s theory of change.
Environment –brain link
Having specified the ways in which brains (via bodies) cause behaviour, the next link in the theory of
change to specify is how the environment can be changed in ways that cause the desired changes in
behaviour. By ‘environment ’we mean physical, biological or social factors external to the actor, which
may include infrastructure, products, norms and explicit interventions such as text messages or
advice from health personnel.
Behaviour settings provide a powerful tool for conceptualising how behaviour is situated in a
particular environmental context –i nt i m e ,i ns p a c ea n di ns o c i e t y( B a r k e r , 1968 ; Goffman, 1959;
Shove, Pantzar, & Watson, 2012; Tharp & Gallimore, 1988). A behaviour setting is a specific and
bounded type of situation in which objects, places and people interact to achieve a common
purpose (shown as a dotted box in Figure 1 ). A behaviour setting –such as a music class, a meal-
time, a business meeting or a car journey –is a far more powerful predictor of individual behaviour
than psychological variables such as intention, be lief or motivation. Indeed, a huge dataset of real-
world observations collected by Roger Barker, one developer of the behaviour setting concept, andHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 431
his team showed that if one knows the setting and the role being played by an individual in it, one
can predict observed behaviour with 90% accuracy (Barker & Schoggen, 1973). The situation versus
personality literature in social psychology simila rly finds significant associations between behav-
iour and setting-related factors (Meyer, Dalal, & Hermida, 2010; Rauthmann & Sherman, 2015;Z i m -
bardo, 2007). For participating individuals, behaviou r settings are an excellent means of avoiding
the need to calculate how to behave from scratch e ach time a situation occurs, and allow everyone
to benefit from cooperating in an activity. Hence, for much of our lives, we allow our behaviour toconform to its setting.
Each behaviour setting is performed as a set of interlocking, regularly occurring actions, called a
‘standing pattern ’(Barker, 1968 ), which is dictated by the design relationships between the environ-
ment, the objects within it, the typically unwritten rules of social engagement and the goals of theindividuals cooperating within the setting (Shove et al., 2012 ). Settings can have a long history of cul-
tural evolution. Take the music class example. Classrooms have, over generations, come to take ashape that fits them to the task of shared learning. Focal objects such as chairs, music scores andinstruments have (been) evolved to fit the need to practice music making. Everyone has learnt
their respective roles by gaining new competencies, and they adhere to these roles using the
scripts that they carry in their heads (and/or a written lesson plan). Each setting also employsdeviance control mechanisms to ensure routines are followed, so when pupils misbehave, for
example, they are reprimanded or ejected, and when an instrument breaks it is mended or replaced.
The standing pattern is normative –it is enforced by those participating, and often by the physical
environment as well, which channels behaviour in appropriate directions. RL ensures that individuals
quickly correct their behaviour, as to behave inappropriately in a setting is embarrassing, shaming
and injurious to the individual ’s social standing. Behaviour settings have evolved through long his-
tories of cultural experimentation and RL until they have stabilised with standing patterns of behav-
iour that efficiently meet the participant ’s needs (Barker, 1968 ; Shove et al., 2012 ; Tharp & Gallimore,
1988 ).
The task of the programmer is thus to map the setting factors that choreograph current behaviour
and then to disrupt the setting in a way that causes behaviour to settle into a new standing pattern.
Although this may be hard to engineer, once established, new patterns of behaviour may be sus-tained for the long term, often a desirable outcome for public health (Kwasnicka, Dombrowski,
White, & Sniehotta, 2016 ).
Intervention –environment link
The last link in the theory of change is that between the intervention and the environment. Program-
mers must design an intervention which causes the entire cascade of cause –effect linkages in the
theory of change to occur, as if they were a line of dominos.
But how, practically, can a behaviour change programmer intervene to make this chain reaction
occur? Choice of the means to initiate the sequence is crucial. Marketers call the context where the
target population come into contact with the intervention a ‘touchpoint ’(Lockwood, 2009 ). Examples
include a billboard at a bus stop, an announcement at a community meeting, a posting to a Facebook
page, a health advice session in a clinic or a TV commercial viewed in a living room.
The behaviour setting within which people are ‘touched ’by an intervention (i.e., the Touch-
point Setting) can be distinct in time and place f rom the setting within which the target behav-
iour is meant to be performed (i.e., the Targe t Setting). For example, people can learn a new
association about a product th rough RL caused by a TV commercial while sitting in their living
room, but must remember to buy the product in the shop and then to use it after that. This intro-duces a last task for the theory of change: the RL it creates has to survive the temporal and spatial
gaps between these settings. In effect, a new valu ation of a product or behaviour has to be suffi-
ciently strong at the initial touchpoint to persist until the moment when the target behaviourshould occur.432 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
The behaviour change challenge
BCD provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how an intervention at one end of the
theory of change, when implemented, can have the desired impact at the other end of the causal
chain. This requires the careful building of a cause –effect cascade. Seen through the lens of RL,
this creates a specific set of challenges to tackle: perception must be linked to action through
reward in specific settings. We identify these challenges as creating surprise, causing revaluation
and enabling performance (in red in Figure 1 ).
Surprise
The first job of the programmer is to modify the environment in a way that causes the perception ofsomething that is capable of producing the desired behaviour. However, in a busy world, sensorychannels are crowded with many perceptions and new stimuli must be made to stand out.
Luckily, we can derive theoretical expectations about how to achieve this. Perceptual systems
have been designed by evolution to attend to aspects of the environment that are salient –that
is, those that represent something unexpected; signalling an opportunity for a reward (or a threat
of a punishment) (Mnih et al., 2015 ; Niv et al., 2015 ). For example, a pebble when it is flying
towards one is a salient stimulus that will occasion action, but this is not true when the same
pebble forms part of a rock-pile beside the road. An intervention must thus change something
about the environment that is both perceptible in a busy environment and unexpected in a salient
way in order to gain the agent ’s attention. We label this first challenge the need to create ‘surprise’
(shown in red in Figure 1 ).
Revaluation
Second, the target agent must act on the stimulus in the environment and so experience a level of
reward that is different from that expected. The intervention needs to ensure that the desired behav-
iour is the best option in the new situation. In effect, the target behaviour must be Revalued so that it
is more likely to be selected as a response.
Understanding the evolved structure of motive s provides programmers with a range of options
to cause revaluation. One way is by emphasising the rewards from performing the behaviour. This
can be done by heightening the sensory salience, temporal proximity or statistical likelihood of
these rewards being experienced. For example, the effects of a perfume on the opposite sex can
be demonstrated graphically in an advertisemen t. Decreasing the wait-time before a reward is
experienced can also increase expected value (as it reduces temporal discounting) (Green &
Myerson, 2004 ). The perceived likelihood of a reward can a lso be influenced using marketing strat-
egies such as offering guarantees and warranties, which increase the expected utility of a purchasedecision.
All behaviours have a ‘proper domain’ motive (i.e., that for which they evolved). For example,
eating food will assuage the Hunger motive, while hygienic behaviours, serving primarily to avoidinfectious disease, reduce Disgust (Curtis, 2014 ). However, other motives can also be recruited to
help instigate behaviour change. For example, food can also be designed to be stored in a cupboard
for a rainy day, satisfying the Hoard motive (as well Hunger later). Hygienic behaviour can be posi-
tioned as good manners, highlighting how mannerly behaviour will lead to social acceptance (theAffiliation motive) (Biran et al., 2014 ). Obviously, the opposite also applies: anti-smoking campaigns
try to make smoking lessvaluable by suggesting that the practice will lower social acceptance. By
varying the number of motives and kinds of rewards attached to the performance of the targetbehaviour, RL takes place, the new behaviour is revalued, and hence it will become more (or less)
likely.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 433
Performance
In addition to getting attention, being processed and causing revaluation, an environmental modifi-
cation must also ensure that the target behaviour becomes part of the standing pattern of its setting.
This is the third, and final, challenge a programmer must meet: performance. Using the metaphor of
theatre (Goffman, 1959 ), the stage on which the target behaviour occurs, or the roles played by the
actors, or the script, or the props have to change, or a combination. The basic rule is: disrupt the
behaviour setting such that the target behaviour becomes part of the standing pattern, whilst allow-ing the setting ’s objectives still to be realised (possibly more efficiently). There are multiple ways in
which this can be achieved.
One kind of disruption is role change. Members of target audiences can be made leaders; for
example, children can be elected class prefects and then be expected to demonstrate exemplary
behaviour as role models (Paluck & Shepherd, 2012 ). Another way of facilitating performance is to
have people modify their own environments by increasing technological support for the target
behaviour. For example, a pedometer is a prop that can disrupt exercise routines (Doyle, 2015 ).
Another kind of disruption is rule change; for example declaring workplaces as smoke-free zones(Fichtenberg & Glantz, 2002 ). Changing behaviour settings represents a powerful and sustainable
way of changing the performance of behaviour, by modifying the social norms, physical objects
and infrastructure that regulate and support behaviour. In effect, settings combine the kinds of
factors that appear to lead to sustainability –motivation, psychological and environmental resources,
habitual performance, and self-regulation (Kwasnicka et al., 2016 ).
Behaviour change is thus a three-part challenge: to create surprise, cause revaluation and facilitate
performance (see Figure 1 again). Note that these three challenges –associated with the three fea-
tures of RL (perception to action via reward) –map directly onto the elements of the BCD theory of
change: the intervention must create surprise in the environment (through implementation), causerevaluation in the brain (via RL) and then facilitate performance of the behaviour itself (in its behav-iour setting).
Designing behaviour change interventions
Having described the BCD theory of change and the science that underlies it, we now address thequestion of how to go about applying science to the design of behaviour changing interventions.Like most design processes, BCD has a number of steps: Assess, Build, Create, Deliver and Evaluate.
Figure 1 depicts the programme development steps wrapped around the theory of change. The A
and B steps are shown as arrows moving from right to left following the sequence by which the
causal links in the theory of change are typically elucidated through investigation, and the D and
E steps as arrows from left to right, as the intervention is delivered and the activation of the
causal links in the theory of change is evaluated. We describe each step in turn.
Assess
In the Assess step, programme designers start by gathering together what is known about the target
behaviours, the target audience, the context for the intervention and its parameters. Attention is paid
to defining precisely which behaviour(s) need to change, and to what is known about the determi-nants of that behaviour, both globally and in the particular programme context. Literature and
experts are consulted and a literature review may be carried out, if one is not already available.
Table 1 shows the BCD checklist (formerly called the ‘Evo-Eco ’checklist (Aunger & Curtis, 2014 )),
which is a comprehensive list of the factors that determine behaviour including habits, motives, plansand the components of behaviour settings. It is used throughout the design process as a template for
organising what is known and unknown about the target behaviour. Its components begin asunknowns, but gradually become ‘knowns ’through the design process.434 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
The ‘A’step culminates in a ‘framing workshop ’of programme stakeholders to review the current
state of knowledge and to draft a theory of change, with specific hypotheses about change mechan-
isms for further exploration. The workshop also sets out the unknowns: questions that still need to be
answered in order to develop the theory of change. In the example in Table 1 , which is taken from an
infant nutrition project in Indonesia, project stakeholders and nutrition experts agreed to the overall
aims, objectives and targets of the BC programme in a framing workshop, and agreed that one (of
three) key behaviours that needed to change was ‘unhealthy snacking ’. It was hypothesised that
mothers did not know ( brain-executive) that snacking was unhealthy for their children (a hypothesis
which was later discounted in the FR). Unknowns included the exact behaviour to target, the feedingsettings and the potential touchpoints.
Build
The next, Build step, has two purposes: first, to fi ll in gaps in knowledge about the determinants of
behaviour and second, to identify the strongest possible theory of change for the target behaviour.FR is generally required because programmers s eldom understand enough about the context and
drivers of the current behavioural patterns with out some immersion in the reality of the target
audience. The findings provide the foundation for the next step, which is to Create theintervention.
In BCD, FR follows consumer research practice, which seeks ‘insights ’, or illuminating, deep truths
about behaviour and its causes (Mariampolski, 2006 ). Insights may be psychological; such as a newTable 1. BCD checklist (with a completed example).

angle on a fundamental motive, or about how the behaviour setting can be disrupted, for example, to
make performance easier.
Data collection and analytic procedures are designed to produce as much material from which to
draw potential insights as possible in a limited time. Tools derive from ethnography, consumerresearch, and design thinking and include: script elicitation, forced choice experiments, videoingof daily routines, inventories of physical objects, motive mapping, product attribute ranking, proto-
typing, story-telling and touchpoint identification. Because BCD is concerned with understanding
motivation and performance, FR prioritises methods that engage with actual behaviour in context,and surface the hidden drivers of behaviour, rather than talk-based methods, such as focus group
discussions and key informant interviews, which tend to bias investigation towards cognitions as
drivers of behaviour.
Tools are chosen to answer specific questions. Once the use of a particular tool stops generating
new information, it is dropped and a new one adopted, as new questions arise. The result is a flexible,iterative process of mainly qualitative investigation. This has the advantage of allowing a small groupof researchers to rapidly cover a lot of conceptual ground (over one to three weeks of fieldwork). The
BCD checklist is used throughout this process to organise incoming findings, and to ensure that all
determinants of the target behaviour are investigated. Updating the checklist can serve as the culmi-nation of each day’s activities.
Returning to the example in Table 1 , the information in the table was generated using a variety of
tools. For example, food attribute ranking –in which mothers were given a basket of food samples
and asked to lay them out along axes such as healthy/unhealthy, natural/unnatural, good/bad for
growth, etc. –showed that mothers knew snacks were less healthy than home-produced meals.
However, ethnographic videoing revealed that mothers were often seen chasing children down
the street, trying to feed them nutritious food that they had prepared whilst the child fled away
The video also made it clear that children had often been fed a snack some half an hour before,
and that this was usually to quiet whining or crying. Hence, despite high levels of knowledge inmothers ’executive brains about good nutrition, they were motivated by the need to keep a child
happy (Nurture) and the need to be seen as a good mother (Affiliation and Status) to feed snacks.As a result, the standing pattern of behaviour was that children were refusing healthy foodbecause they had been fed snacks prior to meal times.
Apart from providing insights, FR can also be used to test hypotheses about the drivers of behav-
iour and to provide background for the creative process. In Indonesia we hypothesised that the figureof a gossiping woman could highlight and challenge local norms about feeding. Tests of the proto-
type idea revealed that this would be acceptable as long as the gossiper was young, foolish and
funny.
After fieldwork, the findings are organised so that they can be used in the second step: identifying
insights that can be used to leverage behaviour change in an intervention. One means of doing this isan insight generation workshop (Plattner, 2010 ). Participants martial all facts, observations and con-
clusions that strike them as salient to the behaviour change problem, writing them on strips of paper.
These are then clustered and recombined, iteratively, to generate a small set of nascent, but rich areas
of ideas, or conceptual frameworks. From this set, the one which those assembled believe can beassociated with the strongest theory of change –and which satisfies other criteria such as feasibility,
acceptability, likely cost and sustainability –is selected to go forward into the Create step. This
process canvases a broad range of information and distills it quickly and efficiently into a singleoutput.
Returning to the example of child snacking in Indonesia, the key insight that emerged from this
process was that mothers were responding to peer pressure to keep their child quiet by offering asnack at the point at which it began to demand food. The theory of change that we constructed
was therefore to disrupt the setting with a surprising action by a respected local figure, and to
revalue feeding healthy snacks as a socially admirable thing to do (Affiliation).436 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
The insights and theory of change then form the heart of the creative brief: the instructions to the
creative team for the Creation of the intervention. The brief includes background to the problem,
what is known about current behaviour, target audience and target behaviour, the theory of
change, intervention design principles, potential touchpoints, as well as the budget, timeline and
deliverables for the programme.
Create
The purpose of the Create step is to design a set of surprising and disrupting intervention strategies
and materials that have maximum effect on the target behaviour. The work is carried out by a creative
team, who may be from an established agency, or be locally constituted, depending on availablefunding. The task is to create concepts that respond to the brief. The management team then
winnows these ideas and the concepts are developed further through a series of proposals from
the agency which are considered and reverted upon by the management team, until the finalconcept is agreed upon. The management team can use criteria such as consistency with the
theory of change (ability to surprise, to revalue or to disrupt performance), programme values, aes-
thetics, prior history, uniqueness, and likely value-for-money, to select among the proposed concepts.
With the creative concept agreed, prototypes of intervention materials and touchpoint plans can
be developed, then tested, preferably in realistic circumstances with representatives of the targetpopulation. Iterations of development with critique again take place during this phase, as prototypesget more and more fully developed. When fully ‘matured’, the intervention package is presented to
the programme team and other stakeholders for final agreement.
In Indonesia, a local creative agency developed the concept of ‘Healthy Gossip ’which, through
many reverts, produced a series of short advertisements which were shown on local and national
TV, as well as an activation programme delivered in women ’s groups. In the case of snacking behav-
iour, the TV ad shows the gossip character offering a snack to a neighbour ’s child, but she is corrected
by the child ’s grandmother pushing her hand away (a somewhat rude and surprising action in this
context) who explains the importance of only offering healthy snacks like fruit. The gossip character
then slaps her head saying how stupid she has been, and then gossips about the correct behaviour toanyone who will listen (see the related ads at http://ehg.lshtm.ac.uk/behavior-centred-design/ ).
We also developed an activation programme delivered in arisans (local women ’s savings groups).
The intervention included ‘emo-demos ’, which are surprising and motivating live demonstrations. For
example, an emo-demo concerning inappropriate infant feeding involved a health agent standing in
front of an audience of mothers. The agent asks if anyone would like to drink some milk. A volunteer,
who has her infant with her, is given a clear plastic bag of milk to drink. The mother is then askedwhether she ever feeds her child crackers ( kropoek)? If so, a broken-up cracker is added to the
mix. Questioning continues with respect to fizzy drinks, sweets, rice, sauce, etc. being added tothe bag. This continues until the bag contains a disgusting lumpy discoloured mixture. Themother is again asked if she will drink it. She typically refuses, and all mothers respond with
disgust exclamations and face pulling. The emo-demo revaluates non-exclusive breastfeeding behav-
iour, associating it with disgust via RL. This deviation from normal health educational messaging issurprising and engaging, causing much hilarity.
3A simplified version of the theory of change for
this part of the campaign is shown in Figure 3 .
Deliver
In the Deliver phase, the intervention is implemented. A large range of channels may be used to reachthe target audience, from one-on-one contact by health agents or peers, to community events, to
outdoor or indoor advertising, to mass and social media. The choice of touchpoints should reflect
the cost and effectiveness of different sorts of contacts. For example, there is often controversy asto whether spending on mass media is worth-while: mass media may have a low impact perHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 437
contact, when compared to direct contact; however, the cost-per-contact for mass media may be so
much lower than for direct contact that it becomes the most cost-effective choice (Scott, Curtis, Rabie,
& Garbrah-Aidoo, 2007 ). Implementation plans that achieve sufficient coverage more cheaply, with
lower skill and equipment requirements, management overheads and over a shorter period
should be preferred. The BCD theory of change can be used to identify critical points that could
affect programme delivery –for example training of facilitators, production of materials, and
methods to get people to attend meetings.
Actual Delivery is monitored to ensure exposure, d ose, coverage, fidelity, acceptability, simpli-
city, brand recognition, evaluability, sustainabi lity and security (from competing campaigns, risk
of misinterpretation and uncontrollable factors) (Carroll et al., 2007;H o f f m a n ne ta l . , 2014 ). In
the Indonesian Healthy Gossip programme, issue s with fidelity, late delivery of production
materials and low attendance at arisan meetings adversely affected the ability of the programme
to deliver behaviour change.
Evaluation
Evaluation is an important step in BCD, gathering evidence of outcomes and impact and determiningwhat has worked, or not worked, and why and providing learning for future programme cycles. As the
specific focus of BCD is behaviour, evaluation primarily focuses on whether behaviour has changed,ideally employing a counterfactual to rule out secular trends. Measuring impacts (such as on health)
can be complex and expensive and may not be necessary if the relationship between behaviour and
health is already well established. However, the choice of measure for behavioural outcomes requirescareful attention as there may be many reasons why self-report is not a valid measure of actual
behaviour (Aunger, 2003 ; Baumeister, Vohs, & Funder, 2007 ; Contzen, De Pasquale, & Mosler, 2015 ;
Klesges et al., 2004 ). Ideally, funding should also be set aside to measure the sustainability of the
behaviour change over the longer term.
Data should also be collected that allows careful appraisal of whether the expected cause– effect
linkages in the theory of change process ( Figure 1 ) actually occurred (i.e., for a ‘process evaluation ’)
(Saunders, Evans, & Joshi, 2005 ). It is also desirable to record facets of the implementation itself:
Figure 3. The Indonesian ‘Healthy Gossip ’campaign ’s breastfeeding theory of change.438 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
coverage and dosage of exposure, acceptability of the programme offerings to the target population,
and its cost-effectiveness (with respect to behaviour change or impact). Since many public healthinterventions are complex, it is important to try and identify which components are proving effective
(van Achterberg et al., 2011 ; French, Olander, Chisholm, & Mc Sharry, 2014 ; Michie, Fixsen, Grimshaw,
& Eccles, 2009 ) However, it is not enough to show correlations between implementation of a tech-
nique and outcome measures. Rather, the specific psycho-social mechanisms claimed by thetheory of change must be shown to have been responsible empirically for the outcome (Peters, de
Bruin, & Crutzen, 2015 ). Process evaluations must therefore test for active psychological, social and
physical environmental changes associated with the programme and the desired outcomes. For
example, we have shown that changes in targeted motives for handwashing were associated with
exposure to a campaign in rural India (Rajaraman et al., 2014 ). The learnings from both types of evalu-
ation (outcome and process) should then provide the starting point for a new cycle of learning by
engaging in the BCD process again to develop new programmes.
In our continuing empirical example, the final evaluation of the Healthy Gossip programme
showed that two of the target behaviours were significantly higher in the intervention than thecontrol groups, that TV and community activations had independent and additive effects on behav-
iour, and that there was an improvement in healthy snacking frequency (White et al., 2015 ). The
process evaluation showed that the theory of change failed to be fulfilled in a number of respects,
mostly having to do with delivery problems such as the fact that the arisan attendance was lower
than expected, although the emo-demos were highly memorable (White et al., in preparation).
Discussion
BCD draws on learnings from many disciplines, including evolutionary, ecological and cognitivepsychology, neuroscience, robotics, behavioura l economics, social and commercial marketing
and design thinking. It is a generic approach which can organise such diverse perspectives on
behaviour. For example, many of the ‘nudges ’that behavioural economists have made famous
(Thaler & Sunstein, 2008 ) qualify as executive control-based decision-making rules. For example,
framing choices in terms of gains rather than lo sses can make desired options more likely to be
adopted.
4Similarly, reducing the number or range of options available can influence decision-
making in ways that lead to desired choices (by reducing cognitive load). Other nudges qualifyas motivational revaluations. For example, providing a financial incentive (i.e., paying people todo the target behaviour) is an overt (but extrinsic ) reward. Yet, other nudges constitute interven-
tions that manipulate the physical environment of the target behaviour setting itself to facilitateperformance (e.g., placing healthier options firs t in a school cafeteria buf fet line (Just & Wansink,
2009)).
Similarly, the results of a recent pro ject to catalogue all the different ‘behaviour change tech-
niques ’(BCTs) in the literature (Michie et al., 2013) can be placed within the BCD theory of
change, providing an ontologically clearer means of organising and selecting amongst them. For
example, the BCTs of ‘classical conditioning’ ,‘negative reinforcement ’,‘habit formation ’and
‘behavioural rehearsal/practice ’are processes covering the entire theory of change (as forms of
RL). On the other hand, ‘social support ’,‘modelling of the behaviour ’,‘instruction on how to
perform a behaviour ’,‘pharmacological support ’or‘restructuring the physical/social environment ’
should be classed as interventions, while ‘identification of self as role model ’,‘goal setting ’and
‘cognitive dissonance ’constitute examples of brain changes expected from exposure to an inter-
vention (i.e., the consequences of surprise). Th u sa n yg i v e nn u d g eo rB C Tc a nb eg i v e nas p e c i f i c
place within the BCD framework.
Design thinking, which originated in engineering practice but has recently infiltrated many crea-
tive fields, suggests that behaviour can be designed through an iterative, collaborative effort between
target populations and designers. BCD uses evolutionary design, seeking an adaptive ‘fit’between
people, their roles, and their actions in particular behaviour settings. It should thus be able toHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 439
accommodate future developments from this movement. BCD thus provides a flexible framework
that can accommodate future insights from efforts to better understand behaviour and its determi-nants in a variety of fields.
As we have emphasised, the object of BCD is to change behaviour through surprise, revaluation
and disruption of performance rather than to carry out ‘messaging ’. Doing so has reliably led to sig-
nificant behaviour change. For example, in the SuperAmma programme in rural India, handwashing
with soap was revalued as an activity associated with being a nurturing mother and performance was
disrupted via eye-spots placed in washing areas (Biran et al., 2014 ). In urban Zambia, four diarrhoea
prevention behaviours were revalued as being socially desirable through live and filmed perform-
ances by a group of well-meaning, but nosey neighbours called the ‘Komboni Housewives ’(Green-
land, Chipungu, Chilengi, & Curtis, 2016 ). In Nepal, safe food hygiene behaviours were revalued via
mothers being awarded ‘ideal mother’ status, whilst food preparation performance was disrupted
in behaviour settings through kitchen makeover parties (Gautam, 2015 ). In Indonesia, child
feeding practices were again revalued and performance was disrupted via a series of ads featuring
a gossiping woman and a surprising, disruptive action –for example, flicking a bottle of formula
milk into a rubbish bin to promote breastfeeding (White et al., 2015 ). Each of these programmes
also employed surprise in that they were eye-catching and non-standard, and they provided newopportunities for RL of positive associations with the target behaviours.
Throughout this paper, we have couched use of BCD in the context of public health programme
development. However, BCD could also work in othe r contexts, such as product design, marketing,
governance, education and self-help, and it ca n be applied to behaviour change problems at popu-
lation, institutional or individual level by adapt ing the focus of the theory of change. For example,
an equivalent causal chain can be created at the level of an organisation (rather than an individual)by substituting organisational processes for psyc hological ones in the middle step. So just as learn-
ing at the level of individual brains requires forming new synaptic connections, so too can changesto organisational procedures be seen as new way s of communicating betw een groups within the
organisation. BCD can also be applied to the case of new product development or rebranding by
recognising that the Create phase must engineer an object or service that w orks as an intervention
i nm u c ht h es a m ew a ya st h ec o m m u n i c a t i o n sp a c k a g e sw eh a v eb e e nd i s c u s s i n g– that is, the
product must generate surprise, revaluation and performance, such that it gets purchased andused. Improving governance, on the other h and, can involve changing the behaviour of a
special target population: bureaucrats and politicians, but the same principles apply –for
example, after various invest igations, a lobbying or pressure group may produce a campaign
(the intervention) designed to convince government officials (the output) to be more transparent
in reporting their job-related expenses (the beh avioural outcome), thus reducing corruption (the
impact). What BCD adds to these problems –besides a unified conception of the steps to be
gone through –is a set of theory-based tools to generate new knowledge at each step, and analytic
procedures that can facilitate an effective theo ry of change being developed and implemented.
Significant efforts are underway to categorise the kinds of intervention components that pro-
grammes use (Kok et al., 2015 ; Michie et al., 2016 ), and to build evidence more systematically
from programme experience (Peters et al., 2015). We believe that BCD provides an additional
resource for behaviour change, as a theoretical framework within which the results of theseefforts can be framed.
Conclusion
The BCD approach is founded in both behavioural science and design thinking practice, underpinned
by a number of fundamental theories:
.RL, which explains how behaviour –environment interactions change future behaviour via reward.
.Behaviour settings theory, which illuminates how context can be manipulated to facilitate change.440 R. AUNGER AND V. CURTIS
.Evolutionary psychology, which explains how three levels of behavioural control have evolved in
the human lineage.
.A five-step design thinking process to construct and evaluate an intervention.
BCD also has features that make it different from most current approaches to behaviour change. It has:
.A single-minded focus on behaviour as the key outcome (not psychological constructs, knowledge,
health or social indicators).
.A theory of behaviour change , rather than of behaviour determination (the type of theory used by
many practitioners currently –although BCD includes a list of behavioural determinants as well).
.A foundation in the ultimate evolutionary purposes of behaviour.
.A focus on the situatedness of behaviour in social and physical setting and the context of other
behaviours.
.A means of distinguishing three levels of psychological control over behaviour.
.An anchoring of the process steps in design thinking.
Despite its roots in theory and behavioural science, BCD was not conceived as an academic exercise,
but to meet the need for a better process for designing interventions. As interest grows in behaviour
change as a route to curing the world ’s ills, much work still needs to be done to develop this applied
science, both in the science and in its application. BCD can be employed to tackle many of the small-
and large-scale behaviour change challenges that we face across the globe. It is also generic enough
to encompass many current approaches to behaviour change, and flexible enough to allow the inte-
gration of new scientific findings about behaviour. As an evolving approach, it provides a platform forthe future development of behaviour change into a fully-fledged applied science.
Notes
1. The elements of the BCD theory of change are similar to those of a standard theory of change in that they link
input, implementation, output, outcome and impact through ‘pathways ’of change (Taplin, Clark, Collins, & Colby,
2013 ). However, it is more prescriptive than standard theories of change about the nature of what can be con-
sidered an output or outcome, because of its focus on behaviour. In particular, an intervention is the input , its
implementation is characterised as the resultant change in the environment, the output is a change in brain
states, a behavioural change is the outcome and the impact is better health (or some other change in a state-
of-the-world). (Note that the actual contents of the theory of change in a given case will include details of specific
causal mechanisms for each of these links, with theoretical justifications, as well as assumptions and conditions
for each link, not just the basic sequence shown in Figure 1.)
2. Simon includes the steps Define, Research, Ideate, Prototype, Choose, Implement and Learn. We collapse the
Ideate, Prototype and Choose steps into our Create step as they share the common purpose of producing inter-
vention materials. Other steps are simply renamed to allow the mnemonic ABCDE.
3. Note that in each of the first three steps (ABC), the intellectual dynamic is the same: one starts with a small set of
elements –knowledge in the Assess step, empirical findings in Build or insights in Create –but then broadens this
set through research (Assess), fieldwork (Build) or ideation (Create), and then narrows the range of items down
again to single hypotheses, for application to the developing theory of change (Mootee, 2013 ). The first half of the
BCD process is therefore one iteratively building a more fully conceptualized theory of change through three
different kinds of knowledge generation processes.
4. Many behavioural economists see their techniques as manipulating aspects of behavioural control that are ‘pre-
dictably irrational ’(Ariely, 2009 ), when many of these ‘biases ’make adaptive sense from an evolutionary perspec-
tive. Loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky, 1984 ) for example (when people are less willing to lose than to gain
something of the same value) can be seen as an adaptive consequence of reinforcement learning in which analready owned object provides more tangible and secure rewards than an imagined one.
