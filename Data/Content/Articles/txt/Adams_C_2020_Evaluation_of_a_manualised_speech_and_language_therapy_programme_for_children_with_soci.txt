Abstract
Background: Children with Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SPCD) have long-term needs in using and
processing social language and have a high risk of later mental health difficulties. A manualised speech and
language therapy programme, the Social Communication Intervention Programme (SCIP) provides therapy content
for SPCD. A feasibility study is required to derive more precise estimates of key parameters for a future trial of SCIP.
Aims: To assess the feasibility of conducting a substantive randomized controlled trial of SCIP for children with
SPCD.
Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to paediatric speech and language therapists in England. Survey
questions addressed number of eligible children, routine intervention provision and trial recruitment factors. In the
second phase, a single-arm intervention feasibility study was completed. Fifteen speech and language practitioners
identified 24 children aged 5 –11 years with SPCD. Practitioners received training/supervision to deliver 20 SCIP
therapy sessions to each child. At time 1, parents of participating children provided three communication goals;
expected steps in each goal were defined. After intervention, parents and practitioners independently rated each
goal compared to baseline ability. Two research practitioners compared parent post-intervention commentaries
with outcome scores to derive guidance about clinical significance. All practitioners recorded audio commentaries
on therapy experiences. Post-intervention interviews were conducted with 6 practitioners and 6 parents. An expert
panel completed a Delphi consultation on trial design.

Results: Routine practice for SPCD varies widely. Children tend to be embedded in autism provision. Participation
in a future trial was well supported provided resources are available to services. Outcomes analysis indicated all
children except one made some progress on parent ratings; all children made progress on practitioner ratings. A
power analysis for a future trial was carried out using current outcome measure as putative primary endpoint.
Practitioners ’audio-diaries provided suggestions for training and adaption in a future trial. Outcomes and therapy
methods were acceptable to practitioners and parents.
Conclusions: The feasibility study evaluated a novel outcome measure of social communication skills in SPCD. A
power calculation indicated a feasible framework for a trial within a realistic period of time. Recommendations for
recruitment methods, adaptation of manual and training were supported by practitioners and an expert panel.

Background
The presence of significant and persistent social commu-
nication difficulties in middle childhood is associated
with adverse outcomes such as behavioural difficulties in
adolescence [ 1], in sustaining peer relations [ 2], success-
ful employment [ 3] and with later mental health condi-
tions [ 4]. This type of communication impairment
comprises disproportionate difficulty with pragmatics
(the social use of language) [ 5] and some structural lan-
guage impairments [ 6,7]. Speech and language thera-
pists (SLT) therefore have a key role in identifying and
managing the social communication needs of these chil-
dren as a contribution to prevention of negative out-
comes. However, despite a call for more research on
pragmatic language intervention in the relevant system-
atic review [ 8], there are no clinical trials available [ 9].
In order to progress to a better state of evidence, it is
necessary to gauge feasibility and identify real and po-
tential barriers to a substantive trial. Known potential is-
sues are the identification of children with social
communication difficulties, consensus on what treat-
ment as usual (TAU) is, whether a novel complex social
communication intervention is acceptable and can be
implemented by SLT practitioners in schools and clinics,
and how changes in social communication and pragmat-
ics can be measured.
The literature describes two groups of children who
have significant and persistent social communication dif-
ficulties with a specific focus on pragmatic impairment.
Children with high-functioning autism spectrum dis-
order (HFASD) have heterogeneous pragmatic deficits
[10] and long-term language processing difficulties [ 11].
A related group of children, termed Social (Pragmatic)
Communication Disorder (SPCD), have similar prag-
matic and language impairments [ 12] but may lie just
below the threshold for ASD diagnosis [ 13]. It is possible
that both these groups might benefit from social com-
munication therapy but at present, we do not knowprecisely what routine SLT therapy services are provided
for either of them. This knowledge is required to con-
struct an alternative treatment condition to any novel
programme in a clinical trial.
Practitioner guidance on intervention approaches for
children with SPCD is provided by professional bodies,
and there is a substantial descriptive therapy literature
[14]. The American Speech and Hearing Association
(ASHA) lists a number of intervention programmes ap-
propriate for school-age children with SPCD, which fall
under the broad heading of social skills interventions.
Gerber et al. [ 9] examined the evidence regarding con-
versation/pragmatics intervention for children who have
SPCD and found small-scale studies only, with variation
in content and goals of treatment, reflecting the diverse
nature of communication needs within the group. Ger-
ber et al. ’s review lamented the absence of theoretical
underpinning of intervention methods and the difficul-
ties of generating clinical guidance in the context of lim-
ited evidence.
In our previous work, we have developed a theoretic-
ally driven, manualised intervention, the Social Commu-
nication Intervention Programme (SCIP), [ 15]
specifically for children with social communication diffi-
culties. The manual includes a method for individualisa-
tion of therapy for heterogeneous pragmatic and
language needs as well as therapy activities/resources. In
a small-scale school-based trial [ 16], Adams and col-
leagues found an advantage of SCIP intervention over
routine treatment on outcomes shown to be of value to
parents/carers: carer-rated pragmatic competence and
changes in social communication and language skills,
teacher-rated learning skills and an observational meas-
ure of conversation skills [ 17]. However, no changes in
language functioning using standardised language tests
were shown.
A traditional approach to outcome measures using im-
pairment measures may therefore not capture changesAdams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 2 of 15
in communication which are of importance to service
users for this group of children [ 18]. In addition, evaluat-
ing outcomes of pragmatic interventions has proved to
be problematic due to the lack of valid and reliable mea-
sures of pragmatics and conversational skills [ 19]. Given
language/pragmatics heterogeneity at baseline, a way for-
ward in a clinical trial of social communication interven-
tion may be to adopt an individualised approach to
therapy planning and a preference-based outcome meas-
ure. We propose to evaluate the feasibility of using a
modified goal attainment scaling (GAS) [ 20] as a pri-
mary endpoint in a clinical trial of SCIP. There is evi-
dence in favour of the use of GAS, over standardised
measures, for sensitivity to clinically significant change
[21] but it has not previously been explored as an out-
come in social communication intervention studies. In
addition, we will address the notion of how clinical sig-
nificance, as observed by service users, relates to such a
scale. Kazdin defines clinical significance as “the prac-
tical or applied value or importance of the effect of an
intervention ”[22]. In the current study, we were inter-
ested in which observed changes in communication be-
haviour coincided with service users ’views on progress.
This may be an important factor in implementing GAS
in a larger project.
The drive for evidence-based preventative actions, ser-
vice user feedback and preliminary findings imply that a
full-scale clinical trial of SCIP may be indicated. A feasi-
bility study is required to derive more precise estimates
of the proposed primary endpoint, level of adherence to
the SCIP treatment protocol, service providers ’and prac-
titioners ’views on acceptable models of delivery, as well
as estimates of recruitment, retention and response
rates.
Aims and objectives
To assess the viability of conducting a substantive ran-
domized controlled trial of SCIP for children aged 5 –11
years who have significant social communication needs,
to survey current service SLT provision and intervention
methods used in England for these children, to refine a
novel intervention for delivery in routine clinical prac-
tice, to estimate parameters for a randomised controlled
trial of the new social communication intervention, to
estimate sample size by studying variability of a modified
goal attainment scaling (GAS) as primary endpoint, to
explore training and acceptability of the intervention
and to obtain expert consensus on key parameters for a
trial.
Methods
The study was carried out in three phases in sequential
order.Phase 1
Aims
To acquire information on the nature of current routine
SLT practice for children with social communication
needs, to identify views on training and support needs of
practitioners to implement SCIP in a clinical trial, to ex-
plore practitioner willingness to participate/be random-
ized in a trial, to estimate the number of eligible child
participants for a clinical trial and to obtain opinions on
key recruitment and participant factors for a substantive
trial.
Method
An online open invitation questionnaire was distributed
to UK National Health Service (NHS) SLTs, and NHS
SLT service leads in England and two independent SLT
practitioners working in private clinics or local authority
maintained schools (non-NHS). 103 SLTs consented to
participate. Of these, 76 complete survey responses were
obtained (51 NHS only, 23 non-NHS only, 2 both NHS
and non-NHS). The sample contained eight NHS and
three non-NHS service managers, all of whom held a
clinical caseload. Response rates were similar to other e-
surveys of specialist SLT. Survey questions addressed
views on issues identified in the phase 1 “Aims ”section
above.
Phase 2
Aims
To estimate the recruitment/retention rates needed to
collect completed data in a main trial, to estimate re-
sponse to questionnaire rates needed to collect com-
pleted data in a main trial, to estimate rates of
practitioner adherence to the intervention, to refine the
characteristics of a modified goal attainment scale
(SCIP-GAS) primary outcome measure for effective use
with the target population and to estimate variability of
the primary endpoint to inform sample size calculations
for a substantive randomised trial.
Phase 2 method
This was a small-scale, single-arm feasibility study. Prac-
titioner recruitment: SLT practitioners, who routinely
treat children with SPCD, were recruited via the re-
search team ’s established links across the northwest of
England, the NIHR Greater Manchester Clinical Re-
search Network and the research team ’s national net-
work. All practitioners worked within the North West of
England, except two independent practitioners from the
south of England. Practitioners were required to have at
least 2 years ’experience of intervention for children with
communication disorders and to be willing to participate
in SCIP training and intervention delivery. Each practi-
tioner contacted at least one family of an eligible child inAdams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 3 of 15
order to recruit and gain consent for participation. All
practitioners were experienced SLTs except one, who
was a special needs teacher with a specialism in language
support. A sample of 15 practitioners and children was
considered sufficient to assess the feasibility criteria and
is large enough to estimate the variance of the primary
outcome measure to inform a sample size calculation for
a substantive trial design [ 23]. Practitioner and child/
family participants were recruited into the study between
September 2016 and October 2017. Baseline assessments
took place during this period. The final follow-up assess-
ment took place in April 2018.
Child participant inclusion criteria were as follows: aged
between 5 years and 0 months and 10 years 11 months; par-
ents/carers able to participate in minimum of five interven-
tion sessions; non-verbal per formance on Ravens Coloured
Progressive Matrices [ 24] centile ≥5; score in the communi-
cation impaired range (< 55) on the Children ’sC o m m u n i c a -
tion Checklist-2 General Communication Composite (CCC-
2) [25]—a parent report measure of language and social
communication skills; social communication problems as ob-
served by the practitioner, de fined as a minimum of two out
of five social communication difficulties on the SCIP social
communication checklist (SCIP-SCCheck), based on charac-
teristics listed in previous c linical descriptive accounts [ 26]
(seeAppendix 1 for checklist). Exclusion criteria were as fol-
lows: severe speech unintelligib ility/deafness, severe conduct/
hyperactivity disorder which precludes engagement with the
intervention and cases where child has no knowledge of Eng-
lish as a spoken language.
For practitioner training, in order to refine SCIP for
practitioner implementation, a programme of training for
practitioners was devised and implemented by a research
speech and language therapist (RSLT) who was also re-
sponsible for all intervention supervision. Training con-
tent was delivered via a 1-day workshop and comprised
pre-course reading on the theoretical rationale, the overall
structure and principles of SCIP delivery; rationale for
assessing language, social cognition and pragmatics; plan-
ning therapy using Assessment-to-Intervention Mapping
method in manual; setting goals from parent priorities
and involving others in therapy delivery.
For phase 2 intervention, practitioners received a
copy of the manual, some therapy resources and 6 h
of supervision from the RSLT across the intervention
period. Initial goals of intervention were refined
jointly with the RSLT. Practitioners delivered inter-
vention with the child in school or at home up to a
maximum of 20 direct therapy sessions. Therapy
commenced within 1 month after baseline assessment.
Liaison with school and family was conducted at the
practitioner ’s discretion and availability of others,
using written means or meetings to share
information.For baseline and outcome measures, a researcher inde-
pendent of the intervention completed other language
assessments for the purpose of intervention planning:
Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4)
[27] and Assessment of Comprehension and Expression
(ACE) [ 28]. The ADOS-2 Module 3 [ 29] was completed
for indicative assessment of ASD. The primary endpoint
was the SCIP Goal Attainment Scale (SCIP-GAS). Par-
ents provided three priority areas for intervention at
baseline assessment (time 1). In discussion with the
RSLT and practitioner, three goals for the SCIP inter-
vention period were set to reflect these priorities. The
SCIP-GAS form set out the parent priority, the baseline
level of ability and the goal (desired ability) after an
intervention (see Appendix 2 for a sample SCIP-GAS
form). After intervention (time 2), parents used the
SCIP-GAS form to rate their child ’s progress. After de-
fining GAS goals at mapping and at outcome (T2), the
parent rated each goal compared to T1 as follows: −1=
got worse, 0 = no change, + 1/+ 2 = partial achievement,
+ 3 = fully achieved, + 4 = slightly exceeded and + 5
greatly exceeded. Practitioners completed a SCIP-GAS
outcome form at Time 2 for each child independently of
the parent.
The analysis consisted of simple descriptive statistics
presented as means (SD) for continuous variables or
count and percent for categorical variables.
For refinement of SCIP-GAS procedure, our explor-
ation of SCIP-GAS as a potential endpoint included an
analysis of what scores would constitute clinical signifi-
cance. In order to do this, two of the investigators (both
senior research SLTs) examined the range of SCIP-GAS
numeric outcomes and linked these with parent narra-
tive comments from the post intervention SCIP-GAS
form to derive guidance about clinical significance. This
was important to allow for confirmation of which GAS
values were associated with notable functional change.
For adherence to intervention manual, adherence dur-
ing intervention was by (a) RSLT ’s analysis of therapy
sessions of practice against the model therapy activity
and (b) analysis of practitioners ’reflective audio-diary of
what content was delivered, how the delivered content
adhered to the manualised version and a short commen-
tary on any difficulties or successes in delivering the
intervention in routine practice. Planned versus deliv-
ered was completed on 30% of the sample of child par-
ticipants, and observation was completed with 5
practitioners (33%).
Phase 3
Aims
To explore factors associated with training and accept-
ability of the intervention to all stakeholders and to ob-
tain consensus on key parameters for a full trial.Adams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 4 of 15
Method
For reflections of participating SLTs, practitioners were
provided with an audio recording device at the start of
intervention. They were asked to make short oral notes
regarding the content and progress in each therapy ses-
sion. Additional notes about changes to plans, changes
or adaptations to the intervention procedure or therapy
activity or regarding the child ’s response to intervention
were requested. Practitioners ’diary entries comprised a
combination of audio recordings plus written contribu-
tions. These were analysed using a Framework Analysis
[30] by one member of the research team. Codes were
defined and recorded incrementally for each participant,
which allowed comparison of the descriptive content
themes across all participants.
For interviews with practitioner and parents, inter-
views were conducted either at the mid-point or im-
mediately after intervention with six SLTs and six
parents of children involved in the study, to ask about
their experience of participating in the study and of
SCIP intervention. A topic guide was developed and
used in all interviews. Practitioner interviews topic
guide covered SCIP training, supervision, GAS goal
setting process, overall content and purpose of ther-
apy; putting SCIP therapy into practice. Parent inter-
views topic guide covered expectations from the
intervention, experience of setting goals for therapy,
experience of therapy and any changes noticed in the
c h i l d ,t h ef a m i l ya n d / o ra ts c h o o l .
For Delphi consensus procedure, towards the end of
the study, a two-round Delphi method consultation
was conducted in which an expert panel of SLT prac-
titioners and managers were surveyed for their views
on a series of statements relating to potential design
and implementation of a clinical trial. For each state-
ment, a paragraph explaining the rationale for the
statement, based on information that had been com-
piled from research activities and/or theoretical sup-
port was provided. Round 1 responses and comments
were analysed, and statements amended where neces-
sary (where consensus was not reached) and resub-
mitted to the panel in round 2. Consensus was
defined as 80% of respondents selecting either ‘Par-
tially Agree ’or‘Strongly Agree ’.
Results
Recruitment and retention for future trial
Routine practice for this population (the potential TAU
condition in a future trial) was found to vary widely in
our survey of SLT practitioners in England. The majority
of practitioners (75%) delegate therapy delivery to school
teaching assistants; 30% of therapy across NHS and non-
NHS provision is delivered by SLT assistants. Weekly in-
dividual and group sessions of 30 –60 min duration arethe most common therapy delivery option. Some ser-
vices did not deliver any therapy at all or provided a
fixed number of sessions in an episode of care model.
The number of intervention resources or approaches
used in current practice was very large; 56 intervention
approaches were described in a sample of 54 practi-
tioners. A large majority of respondents to the survey
would be willing to be randomised in a future trial but
time available would be a major barrier to participation.
Twenty-three percent of SLTs would be willing but un-
able to participate. Fifty-five percent of respondents
agreed that a trial was an important method to show ef-
fectiveness of a new intervention. Other points relevant
to recruitment are made in the Delphi study findings
below.
Training and support needs for a future clinical trial
were identified in the survey and later confirmed in
practitioner diary analysis and the Delphi study.
Forty-three percent of phase 1 survey respondents
stated that they would require support and training in
recruitment of child partic ipants in a future trial.
D e d i c a t e df u n d i n ga n dt i m ea w a yf r o mr o u t i n ed u t i e s
was specified as a support need by 26% of respon-
dents. Other requirements were listed as provision of
information for parents and support from service
leads. The majority of survey respondents would re-
quire support for involving others in intervention,
permission from service lead to participate, opportun-
ity to deliver the intervention flexibly and ability/time
to share information with teachers and education sup-
port workers. Some respondents recommended being
able to integrate a new intervention into an existing
package of care.
In the feasibility intervention study (phase 2), SLT ser-
vices and individual practitioners generally gave a posi-
tive response to recruitment requests. Of the NHS
Research and Development (R&D) services approached,
50% were able to proceed into the study; R&D approval
ranged from 10 days to 4 months. Reasons for not pro-
ceeding were varied but mainly based on cost and staff
time. There was a highly variable approach to treatment
costs across services. Recruitment progression, with-
drawal and refusal reasons for NHS services only are
shown in Fig. 1.
Four phase 2 practitioners were solo non-NHS SLTs;
one was a specialist advisory teacher. The potential
length of recruitment period per service, practitioner
and child ranged from 5 weeks (non-NHS independent
practitioner) to 9.5 months (NHS). Of 41 practitioners
contacted, 15 practitioners were recruited, trained and
started intervention; twelve completed intervention com-
prising 7 NHS SLT, 4 non-NHS SLTs and one specialist
teacher. Dropout in NHS practitioners was 40% (illness
and workload were reported as reasons); there was noAdams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 5 of 15
dropout in non-NHS practitioners. Child participant re-
tention and exclusions are shown in the Consort dia-
gram in Fig. 2. Forty-six children were referred to the
study; 22 children started intervention but only 20 com-
pleted. Reasons for non-progression are shown in the
diagram.
Overall, the survey responses (phase 1) indicated that
SPCD is not a rare condition in the population of children
requiring SLT, but that these children were often included
in ASD services whether diagnosed with autism or
not. Therefore, SPCD may be difficult to isolate as a
population. Individual responses regarding the propor-
tion of caseload diagnosed as SPCD were too variable
to be informative. An analysis of potential eligible
participants was attempted from the literature and
National Statistics [ 31]. We proceeded with caution
since epidemiological studies in language disorders
tend to refer to Developmental Language Disorder
(DLD) or the broader Speech Language and Commu-
nication Needs (SLCN). Approaching from the SLCN
angle, the population preva l e n c eo fl a n g u a g ed i s o r d e r
as measured by teaching screening is 7.58% with clin-
ically significant DLD [ 32]. This is equivalent to 2
children in every class of 30 pupils. However, only aproportion of these children will have SPCD. Taking
7.58% of the population of current 6 year olds in Eng-
land ( n= 729,674) provides an estimate of 55,509
children with SLCN currently. We used prevalence of
a similar condition to SPCD (receptive language dis-
order), 4.5% [ 33] to conservatively estimate the pro-
portion of children with SLCN as having SPCD. This
estimates the SPCD population to be 2498 children at
age six (14,987 across 6 age bands in England). Ap-
proaching from the HFASD angle where there are
more robust epidemiological studies and taking 1.16%
of population as diagnosed with autism [ 34] yields a
total of 8464 with ASD, from which 32% are esti-
mated to be high-functioning [ 35]w h i c hi n d i c a t e s
2708 children at age 6 with HFA (16,248 across 6 –11
age bands).
Outcomes of feasibility intervention study, questionnaire
response rates and treatment adherence
The characteristics of children recruited into the feasibil-
ity intervention study are shown in Table 1. All children
met criteria for communication impairment on the Gen-
eral Communication Composite of the CCC-2 and dem-
onstrated a high number of social communicationFig. 1 Recruitment approaches in SCIP feasibility study: NHS service level only. * CCG, Clinical Commissioning GroupAdams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 6 of 15
difficulties on the SCIP SCCheck. On ADOS module 3,
11 child participants met criteria for ASD; nine were de-
fined as SPCD as they had pragmatic impairments but
did not meet the autism diagnostic criteria. A wide range
of scores on subtests of ACE and CELF-4 tests was ob-
served with all mean scores in the impaired range,indicating the presence of language impairments in most
children.
Parent SCIP-GAS forms were completed at home and
posted back to the research team at time 2. Parents rated
their children ’s progress at time 2 against three goals set at
baseline. Most parents completed the form independently;Fig. 2 Consort diagram for SCIP feasibility intervention studyAdams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 7 of 15
only one asked for a home visit to assist completion of the
form. Some parents discussed the SCIP-GAS with the
RSLT after they had completed it. This was largely con-
firmatory in nature. Practitioners rated progress compared
to goals using the same scale and pre-defined steps. They
completed this independently from parent and RSLT and
posted their ratings directly to the researcher who was in-
dependent of the intervention.
In the intervention planning process, we stipulated
that for each SCIP-GAS goal ‘expected achievement ’
would score 3. Mean SCIP-GAS scores by rater are
s h o w ni nT a b l e 2. Descriptive analysis indicates all
children except one made some progress on parent
ratings; all children made progress on practitioner rat-
ings. Practitioner ratings tended to be higher than
parent ratings with the mean total score nearing ex-
pected achievement on all three goals. Using the sumof the achieved SCIP-GAS scores ( n=2 0 ) ,w i t h o u t
weighing for difficulty or importance, mean parent
SCIP-GAS score = 6.8 (SD 3.1) and mean SLT SCIP-
GAS score = 8.6 (SD 2.2).
One of the study ’s aims was to refine the GAS proced-
ure in order to establish a meaningful outcome. Analysis
of parent narrative post-intervention and the range of
SCIP-GAS scores for all child participants indicated that
clinical significance was associated with scores in the 6 –
9 point range; highly significant was associated with
scores above 9 (see Table 3). These findings were used
in a power calculation for a clinical trial. Further discus-
sion and analysis of clinical significance and outcomes of
pragmatics intervention are presented elsewhere [ 36].
Response rates to questionnaires (parents) were uni-
formly high. Both SCIP-GAS and CCC-2 questionnaires
were returned at 100% for time 1 and time 2 assess-
ments. This reflects the close interaction between the re-
search team and the parents and practitioners
throughout the study.
Adherence to the intervention was high for both audit
of the planned intervention content versus delivered
content (adherence 92%) and adherence to therapy pro-
cedures in the SCIP manual (100%). The majority of
practitioners except one (non-NHS) were compliant
with supervision.
Acceptability and consensus: audio diary analysis,
interview analysis and Delphi consensus findings
Two hundred and thirty-eight audio diary sessions were
submitted by 14 practitioners, covering 20 cases. Key
themes are presented below with illustrative quotes.
Participant SLTs viewed training and supervision as
essential for implementation, as did respondents to the
SCIP survey.
Training was essential, really important to under-
stand the mapping processes, would be difficult for
the integrity of the programme to be maintained
without that. (J131end of therapy reflection)
Access to expert supervision was a key theme related
to the optimal implementation of the intervention. Some
individuals felt that more time on the initial training
would have been helpful, whilst others reported that
they needed the experiential learning through starting to
use the programme, with regular and timely access to
the supervisor. Practitioners wanted a longer training
course or access to information online. As practitioners
engaged in delivery, they reported becoming more
confident in using the manual.Table 1 Child participants: characteristics including language

Challenges to intervention delivery were also identi-
fied: Some practitioners did not feel equipped to
complete the intervention mapping and SCIP-GAS goal
setting independently and wanted more time to become
familiar with the intervention content. Most participants
reported that they had felt very challenged and
“stretched ”by the very detailed manual, and felt that
they were still not sufficiently familiar or confident to
use SCIP without reliance on the supervisor.
I completely see the need to have all the activities,
but I think it will take a considerable amount of
time to become familiar with what I am looking for,
and to be able to move around the resource easily.
(J16 end of therapy reflection)
Some practitioners reflected on meeting the demands
of participating in research over and above therapy
delivery:
[it’s been a ] …challenge finding time to deliver and
prepare sessions as well as recordings and supervi-
sion. (K19)
A strong theme from practitioners was that SCIP is
different to current therapy provision, and that pro-
tected time to learn the new approach and get to
know it were essential. Se veral practitioners com-
mented that the overall length of intervention was
not sufficient. Frequent concerns were reported re-
garding the time taken to prepare, deliver and write
up sessions. Weekly delivery was the maximum that
could be provided due to the time required. Partici-
pants wanted to adapt SCIP to suit their case or their
context, for example, to deliver therapy sessions of
less than 1 h duration, extend the duration of inter-
vention, request meetings with school staff for infor-
mation sharing or to support generalisation.
The SCIP-GAS outcome measure was acceptable
to practitioners. SCIP-GAS goals were set by the
RSLT, not the practitioners. Practitioners wanted to
know the child and the intervention content more
thoroughly before setting goals. Some wanted to
complete phase 1 therapy before setting GAS goals.
They also wanted to carry out the baseline
assessments:Would feel more confident and insightful if I had
more involvement in the early stages of assessment
and planning ….would have felt clearer about
delivering intervention if I ’d worked jointly with the
research team from the start. (K19)
Practitioners wanted to discriminate between GAS
scores to report whether a skill was viewed as estab-
lished or emerging. Participants ’views of the GAS goals
had largely changed at time 2, in that having seen pro-
gress, they now viewed the goals as appropriate, which
caused some to reflect on their own practice.
It’s a shame that it ’s only 20 sessions. He has moved
up across the board and so many avenues have
opened up for further improvement with him, and
there is no way he would have had anything like 20
sessions in our usual service. (G05)
Practitioners also reported a range of adaptations and
deviations in their implementation of SCIP. These adap-
tations were predominantly related to time, including
shortening sessions and splitting sessions. Most partici-
pants reported that they anticipated they would become
faster and more confident about personalising resources
and activities per child and were positive about continu-
ing to use SCIP with other children. Participants pro-
posed that they would ideally wish to involve the
families more directly in the intervention delivery.
Parents valued discussing goals with the RSLT and
strongly valued the individualised approach of the
intervention:
What I really like about it is having those persona-
lised goals ”(A30)
“I love the idea of setting goals rather than just fol-
lowing a format and it being flexible dependent on
the child ’s needs. (E29)
The SCIP-GAS outcome method was acceptable to
parents: all but one completed the form independently:
I really liked the form and the descriptions of
changes in skills were really helpful to see and think
about. (E27)Table 3 Analysis of association of SCIP-GAS scores with clinical significance judgements

Most parents also reported other changes in their
child not listed as GAS goals.
He is more motivated and less impulsive. (E27)
He is thinking more about sharing and he said ‘I
need to try and think about this ’.H e ’s aware of
strategies but he ’s not always when he ’s in the situ-
ation to put them in place. (C16)
Some refinement of the SCIP-GAS rating scale was
proposed. Being able to report changes not listed on the
SCIP-GAS form as goals is important. One family re-
ported no change on the GAS goals, but listed other im-
portant changes for their child as having occurred
during the intervention period. Parent priorities were
often focused on social “fitting in ”and secondary transi-
tions. Parents reflected on the nature of SCIP therapy in
bringing about these changes.
It specifically hones in on areas your child needs
help with. Rather than previous therapy, which is all
a bit generalized. (D18)
Parents preferred delivery of intervention in school
time and at school. They perceived the involvement of
school in intervention as variable. Additional SCIP work
at home was sometimes difficult to incorporate into the
family routine.
Power calculation and Delphi consensus findings
A power calculation for a future trial was carried out
using Clsampsi in Stata and SCIP-GAS as the primary
endpoint. A 10-point score in SCIP-GAS was clinically
meaningful as derived from conservative estimates in
this feasibility work; based on a standard deviation of 15,
this is a 0.66 effect size. We account for clustering in the
SCIP arm with an ICC = 0.01 with 4 SLTs and assume
there is no clustering in the treatment as usual (TAU)
arm. With 1:1 allocation and 0.05 significance level, a
simple two-tailed ttest with 100 people per group gives
85% power to detect an effect size of 0.5 and 96% power
for an effect size of 0.66. In practice, power will be in-
creased by using multiple regression. To allow for 20%
attrition in the primary outcome at primary endpoint,
we will recruit 250 participants into a trial at baseline
split equally across sites.
From the Delphi consensus study, there was 100%
agreement that, in a future trial, TAU will be defined
by the offer made to children within each service;
children should be recruited from NHS and non-NHS
services (including schools and independent practices);
SLTs will be eligible to participate in a randomised
controlled trial if they have protected time to deliver
the intervention; training in identifying and managingthe needs of children with SCD should be offered to
teachers and teaching assista nts; training in identify-
ing and managing the needs of children should be
provided to parents/carers; the views of children will
be sought from those children who are considered
capable of engaging with the procedure; the views of
parents/carers of children should be sought as part of
the trial; and the range and scope of acceptable adap-
tations to the manualised intervention process and
procedures will be clearly defined in the research
protocol and controlled in implementation.
There was more than 80% agreement that, in a fu-
ture trial, SCIP will be delivered in weekly 1:1 ses-
sions by an SLT (with or without assistant); SCIP
should be compared to both TAU and/or an alterna-
tive controlled programme; engagement by parents
and TAs should be defined as an inclusion criterion;
an individualised functional measure of the child ’sr e -
sponse to therapy should be the primary endpoint;
SLTs will be eligible to participate in a randomised
controlled trial if they undertake supervision and pro-
vide supervision to assistant practitioners; and that
SLTs will be eligible to participate in a randomised
controlled trial if they und ertake training and engage
in independent study.
Discussion
What we found
SCIP intervention was associated with progress on social
communication ratings for all but one of 15 children
with SPCD. SLT practitioners valued SCIP therapy and
were universal in choosing to continue providing SCIP
in their routine practice. They found the intervention
complex and needed more preparation and learning time
than anticipated to implement it. Parents of children
with SPCD valued the intervention highly, and the ma-
jority were able to participate in making judgements
about outcome independently.
Current provision of speech and language therapy for
children with SPCD is highly variable in England, and
this will have significant implications for development of
a comparison condition in a future trial. There is no
current recommended standard of delivery in terms of
frequency, method of intervention or mode of delivery.
However, SLTs indicated that they were aware of the
need for more evidence and showed substantive support
for engagement in a clinical trial. The majority of survey
respondents were willing to be randomised in a future
trial. Time and resources are significant barriers to
participation.
Challenges existed in terms of practical aspects of re-
search engagement. SLT services are no longer uniquely
commissioned by or provided by the NHS, but are part
of a mixed economy of education and health models,Adams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 10 of 15
with rapid growth of the independent SLT sector also
evident. There was a difference in retention and research
engagement between NHS and non-NHS services. Non-
NHS practitioners had more flexibility to make research-
involvement decisions.
SPCD is often included in autism services (with or
without diagnosis), making it difficult to isolate as a
population. Analysis of national statistics and research
literature indicates a potential pool of over 30,000 eli-
gible children with either SPCD or HFA in the 6 –11-
year age range who could benefit from SCIP. Our power
analysis recommends recruitment of 250 (to allow two
groups of 100); therefore, sufficient children should be
available and eligible to support a larger scale trial.
SPCD and HFA-diagnosed children were equally repre-
sented in our intervention sample, indicating eligibility
for SCIP should be based on need rather than solely on
diagnosis.
The SCIP-GAS outcome measure was acceptable to
practitioners and parents. Practitioners were able to use
descriptions of change to identify progress against tar-
gets. Practitioners wanted to know the child and inter-
vention content better before setting goals. Parents
valued discussing goals with the Research SLT and
strongly valued the individualised approach of the inter-
vention. Parents preferred delivery of intervention in
school time and at school. Response rates to parent ques-
tionnaires were very high (nearing 100%). Treatment ad-
herence was also very high amongst practitioners.
Analysis of practitioner diaries helped to identify spe-
cific areas of support for a future trial.
Practitioners were clear that learning SCIP and imple-
menting it for the first time presented challenges. They
indicated that in a future trial, there was a need for add-
itional time to learn a complex intervention based on
multiple components, and that additional time would be
needed for preparation and recording of intervention
sessions. Supervision was essential after initial training;
even experienced practitioners were not familiar with
therapy methods and planning procedures used in SCIP.
However, all practitioners valued the intervention highly
and were planning to carry on delivering SCIP in their
routine practice in future. SLTs wanted to adapt SCIP to
suit their case or their context. Practical suggestions
were made for adaptation and revisions to the SCIP
manual and resources.
Limitations
As a single-arm feasibility study, focused on measures
and acceptability, there was no comparison group, so it
is possible that any appropriate intervention over and
above what was currently being offered could be effect-
ive. It was not possible to define TAU in this study, since
there is considerable variability in practice. TAU willneed to be broadly defined and monitored in a future
trial to provide a true comparison for SCIP. We under-
estimated the time practitioners would need to learn and
engage with the new intervention, despite their experi-
ence, and this resulted in more close supervision being
required than anticipated. In future work, practitioners
will require more training to support careful and more
independent planning as well as time to familiarise
themselves with the new complex intervention. A poten-
tial source of bias in outcomes is the involvement of par-
ents in the SCIP-GAS procedure. With interventions
such as SCIP, it is neither possible nor desirable to have
minimum contact between the therapist and the service
user, so bias towards reporting of positive effects is pos-
sible. In a future trial, it would be essential to distance
the reporting of outcomes away from the practitioner
and intervention supervisor in the first instance. How-
ever, the value of capturing functional outcomes re-
mains. Suggestions for amendments to the GAS
procedure are made below.
Implications for a future trial
Experience of recruitment and feedback from the Delphi
study indicated that trial recruitment should be broadly
based on social communication need and include all
SLT service provision across all sectors. We will identify
child participants as having “significant social communi-
cation difficulties who will benefit from SCIP interven-
tion”as recommended by the advisory and Delphi
panels. This increases the number of eligible participants
available to the trial and reflects the sample in the feasi-
bility study. Calculations from recruitment effort in the
feasibility study indicate that 250 children can be re-
cruited to the study in two calendar years across the
north of England. The inclusion of children with high
functioning autism who have pragmatic language im-
pairment will improve the size of the potential sample.
There is no counter-indication to this from the out-
comes of the feasibility study primary endpoint or from
the description of the language needs of children in the
current study.
Recruitment would be via NHS SLT services, local
education authorities and i ndependent SLT providers.
Two gathered cohorts will be recruited in consecutive
years. A refined recruitment description will be used
based on feasibility feedback. Sufficient time should
be included to allow for permissions to be in place
across a range of providers for appropriate informa-
tion, consent and pre-screening to take place. NHS
SLT departments tend to be small and have multiple
populations to serve other than SPCD. Our experi-
ence of recruiting NHS practitioners indicates that
direct employment or secondment of SLT practi-
tioners into a trial will provide a more reliable sourceAdams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:137 Page 11 of 15
of basic evidence of effect in a trial whilst English
SLT commissioning procedures settle.
The substantive trial would be a two-armed, rando-
mised, controlled, assessor-blinded superiority trial of
SCIP versus treatment as usual (TAU) for children, aged
6 to11 years2, who have social communication difficul-
ties. This population will include children who have high
functioning autism (HFA) and who are able to commu-
nicate through spoken language and able to cooperate
with intervention. The primary objective would be to
compare the effects of SCIP intervention versus TAU on
parent completed SCIP-GAS primary endpoint. Since
routine practice is highly variable, treatment as usual in
a future trial would need to be defined and monitored.
In the current study, the Delphi consensus findings rec-
ommended that TAU would be defined by the offer
made to children with SPCD/HFA within each service.
Children in the SCIP condition would be offered a fixed
amount of intervention (20 direct sessions) guided by
the intervention manual and delivered in weekly 1:1 ses-
sions by SLTs who will undergo a training programme
and receive supervision from a RSLT.
The primary endpoint will be the refined SCIP-GAS
measure. All participants will be assessed by a research as-
sistant blind to condition. SCIP-GAS goals will be set for
all children by research SLTs using parent priorities for
intervention. SCIP-GAS change scales would be set but
not provided to parents until the end of the intervention
period, regardless of randomised group. Time 2 GAS out-
comes would be carried out by a researcher independent
of the main research team using a scripted procedure and
T1-set scale for that individual. GAS goals would be pro-
vided at time 1 to the TAU practitioner; any adaptation of
TAU aims post GAS sharing would be monitored. A mini-
mum of 2 out of 3 GAS goals scoring at least 2 or more
will indicate a clinically significant change from the child ’s
baseline presentation. If the total score for a child was 3 or
below, this would be judged as not clinically significant.
These changes should be confirmed by a positive narrative
comment from the parent using the following question for
each goal: “You gave this goal a score of x. Tell me some-
thing you have noticed in your child that makes you think
that? ”
Parent participation in a future trial is supported by
excellent engagement with research questionnaires. In a
trial, parent engagement should be supported by training
in research participation and SCIP prior to intervention
or TAU. Preference for location of intervention was inschool, and this was supported by the Delphi panel. In a
trial, training and support should be offered to relevant
school staff to allow support for research participation.
Brief training in SCIP methods for school staff should
not exceed similar training provided in TAU. To plan
forwards for potential implementation, information
should be acquired during a trial regarding the practical
arrangements for training and delivering SCIP as part of
routine practice. Other recommendations from the Del-
phi study and from SLT practitioners regarding adapta-
tion of SCIP intervention manual and procedures should
be implemented at the start of the trial.
Conclusions
This feasibility study has provided a crucial step prior to
providing definitive data in a follow-up trial. The dis-
tinctive nature of the SCIP intervention approach was
affirmed by all the participants, with the recognition that
this approach may provide an impact for children who
have complex needs and who have not benefitted from
standard therapy. A trial has a clear potential trajectory
into patient benefit with a change in services towards
evidence-based practice for children with social commu-
nication difficulties called for by service users. A future
trial needs to take into account recent changes in speech
and language therapy provision and the time pressures
associated with research engagement in a small profes-
sion. It may be efficient to build a training model to cas-
cade the intervention to SLT practitioners as part of
ongoing learning after robust evidence has been devel-
oped. There is scope in further work to extend the inter-
vention to other related groups such as children with
HFA who use alternative communication devices or chil-
dren who have secondary pragmatic difficulties associ-
ated with learning disabilities.
An innovative primary outcome (SCIP-GAS), based on
parent preference, has been refined that meets with re-
quirements of practitioner and service users and has en-
abled a power calculation for a trial. Initial analysis of
associations between narrative outcomes and SCIP-GAS
ratings has allowed us to explore the functional impact
of the outcome measure. In addition, we now have an
appreciation that goal attainment scaling may have wider
application for groups with heterogeneous communica-
tion needs. Additional service-user secondary outcomes
that may be used in a future trial are currently being
evaluated and will include a child-perspective interview
task and appropriate standardised measures, including
parent reported measures.
Qualitative findings underlined the value and ac-
ceptability of SCIP intervention to families. We have
gained insight into the preferred context and timing
of intervention for services. Experience of recruitment,
intervention planning, training and supervision has2This age range varies slightly from our previous chosen range (lower
limit of 5 years) since we found younger children struggled with some
of the SCIP therapy content and its reliance on the written word. The
