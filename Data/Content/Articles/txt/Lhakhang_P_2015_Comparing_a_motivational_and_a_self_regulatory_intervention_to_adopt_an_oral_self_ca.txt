A sequential intervention to facilitate the adoption and maintenance of dental ﬂossing
was conducted among 205 students in India, aged 18 –26 years. Two experimental
groups received different treatment sequences and were observed at three assessment
points, 34 days apart. One group received ﬁrst a motivational intervention (intention,
outcome expectancies, and risk perception, followed by a self-regulatory intervention(planning, self-ef ﬁcacy, and action control). The second group received the same
intervention in the opposite order. Both intervention sequences yielded gains in terms
ofﬂossing, planning, self-ef ﬁcacy, and action control. However, at Time 2, those
who had received the self-regulatory intervention ﬁrst, were superior to their counter-
parts who had received the motivational intervention ﬁrst. At Time 3, differences
vanished as everyone had then received both interventions. Thus, ﬁndings highlight
the bene ﬁts of a self-regulatory compared to a mere motivational intervention.

Introduction
Periodontal diseases and dental caries are among the most prevalent dental diseases
affecting people worldwide (Agarwal et al., 2010 ). Dental ﬂossing is the most com-
monly recommended adjunctive oral self-care method to prevent such diseases
(Sambunjak et al., 2011 ). However, a large proportion of people ﬂoss their teeth less
than recommended or not at all (Petersen, 2008 ). In India, there is lack of appropriate
oral health education even among literates, and ﬂossing is not a well-known behavior
(Kumar, 2012 ).
Motivation or self-regulation?
Informing individuals about the bene ﬁts of ﬂossing and the risks of poor oral self-care
is not enough. They need to develop a motivation to act and self-regulatory skills to
translate their intentions into action. Research has provided compelling evidence on thebeneﬁcial effects of motivation and self-regulation processes on dental ﬂossing

(e.g. Schüz, Sniehotta, & Schwarzer, 2007 ; Schüz, Sniehotta, Wiedemann, & Seemann,
2006 ; Suresh, Jones, Newton, & Asimakopoulou, 2012 ). Moreover, a great deal of
research has documented the pivotal role of planning as a self-regulatory strategy inhealth behavior change (for a review, see Hagger & Luszczynska,
2014 ). However,
research has not addressed the question whether the order by which intervention compo-
nents (motivation and self-regulation) are delivered, is relevant for the effectiveness ofdental ﬂossing promotion.
Perceived self-ef ﬁcacy
Perceived self-ef ﬁcacy is the con ﬁdence in one ’s ability to execute a dif ﬁcult or
resource-demanding behavior. The barrier here is not the technical dif ﬁculty of oral self-
care behavior but rather the regular performance as an integral part of daily life which
is not easy for some people. Self-ef ﬁcacy predicts a range of health behaviors including
oral self-care (Anagnostopoulos, Buchanan, Frousiounioti, Niakas, & Potamianos,
2011 ;
Buglar, White, & Robinson, 2010 ; Jönsson, Baker, Lindberg, Oscarson, & Öhrn, 2012 ;
Mizutani et al., 2012 ; Stewart, Wolfe, Maeder, & Hartz, 1996 ).
Beneﬁcial effects of self-regulatory skills on dental ﬂossing have been reported
(Münster Halvari, Halvari, Bjørnebekk, & Deci, 2012 ; Schüz et al., 2007 ; Sniehotta,
Araujo Soares, & Dombrowski, 2007 ). A combination of self-ef ﬁcacy and planning is
associated with higher frequency in dental self-care (Pakpour, Hidarnia, Hajizadeh, &
Plotnikoff, 2012 ; Pakpour & Sniehotta, 2012 ).
Action control and planning
Self-regulatory skills such as action control facilitate adherence to dental ﬂossing with
self-monitoring being the most effective component of action control (e.g. Schüz et al.,
2007 ; Schwarzer, Antoniuk, & Gholami, 2014 ; Suresh et al., 2012 ). Action control com-
prises monitoring one ’s progress, comparing performance with goals, and investing
more effort if needed.
Action planning refers to the when, where, and how of an intended behavior
whereas coping planning pertains to the anticipation of barriers and ways to overcomethem. A great deal of research has documented the pivotal role of planning interventionsfor a variety of health behaviors (Hagger & Luszczynska,
2014 ; Kwasnicka, Presseau,
White, & Sniehotta, 2013 ).
Aims and hypotheses
It is examined whether one intervention sequence is superior to the other. According to
the health action process approach (Schwarzer, 2008 ), a motivational intervention should
precede a self-regulatory intervention because, in unmotivated individuals, ﬁrst a behav-
ioral intention needs to be formed before they can adopt and maintain the actuallyintended behavior. Thus, an intervention sequence starting with motivation and followedby self-regulation is the most intuitive one. However, it may be that some participantsdo not bene ﬁt from such a sequence because they feel patronized by the motivational
messages or they perceive them as redundant, as they are already beyond that stage. In
such cases, a mere self-regulatory intervention without a motivational precursor wouldbe the better and more parsimonious option. Moreover, the intervention bene ﬁts should
not only be documented by changes in dental self-care but also by changes in mindsets382 P. Lhakhang et al.
as reﬂected by higher levels of self-ef ﬁcacy, planning, and action control. Thus, the fol-
lowing hypotheses are put forward:
(1) Participants will improve their oral self-care as re ﬂected by attaining higher lev-
els of dental ﬂossing than before the intervention, independent of group assign-
ment.
(2) Participants receiving a motivational intervention prior to receiving a self-regula-
tory intervention (Sequence 1) will show a superior pattern of gains over time interms of ﬂossing, self-ef ﬁcacy, planning, and action control, as compared with
participants receiving a self-regulatory intervention prior to a motivational one(Sequence 2).
(3) While participants are in the self-regulation condition, they will gain more than
while being in the motivation condition, no matter at which point in time.
Method
Participants
University students ( N= 231) were recruited from a student residence in New Delhi,
India, through a notice by the student council board of the host institute with an author-
ity permission (Table
1). Individuals who had dental treatment or made travel plans dur-
ing the study time were excluded. After 7 of them did not agree to participate, the ﬁnal
sample consisted of 106 women and 99 men, (mean age = 20.7 years with SD = 1.59and range of 18 –26 years).
Research design and procedure
By cluster randomization, participants were allocated to two intervention groups using a
crossover design. One group (Sequence 1) received a written motivational package after
the baseline measurement (Time 1; T1) and a written self-regulatory package after thepost-test (Time 2; T2). The other group (Sequence 2) was treated with a self-regulatorypackage after baseline measurement and after T2 with a motivational package (seeFigure
1). Each intervention session lasted 20 min, and the measurement intervals were
17 days from T1 to T2, and another 17 days from T2 to Time 3 (T3). The study wasconducted by the ﬁrst author together with four student research assistants, who were
blinded completely and, therefore, were not aware of the aims, intervention content, and
any other information that could bias the results.
Measures
Dental ﬂossing was assessed with an open answer format: “During the last week, I have
ﬂossed my teeth …times per day ”.

Self-efﬁcacy was assessed with six items ( αT1= .88), ( αT2= .84), and ( αT3= .75),
including three items for task self-ef ﬁcacy (e.g. “I am con ﬁdent that I can start ﬂossing
immediately on a regular basis even if it is time consuming ”); and three items for cop-
ing self-ef ﬁcacy (e.g. “I am con ﬁdent that I can regularly ﬂoss my teeth on a long-term
basis even when I cannot see any immediate effects ”).
Planning was assessed with six items ( αT1= .80), ( αT2= .87), and ( αT3= .76), three
items measuring action planning (e.g. “I have made a concrete and detailed plan regard-
ing when and where to ﬂoss my teeth ”) and three items measuring coping planning
(e.g. “To keep my ﬂossing habit in dif ﬁcult situations, I have made a concrete plan
regarding what to do if something interferes with my ﬂossing goal ”).
Action control was assessed with two items ( αT1= .70), ( αT2= .75), and ( αT3= .52)
(e.g. “I often had my ﬂossing intentions on my mind ”).
All variables were assessed using four-point scales ranging from 1 ( not at all true)
to 4 ( exactly true ).
Interventions: self-regulatory and motivational intervention conditions
Both sequence groups received the motivational as well as the self-regulatory treatment.
Intervention content is described in terms of the Behavior Change Techniques (BCT;
Michie et al., 2013 ). In the motivational condition , participants received a package with
Figure 1. CONSORT ﬂow chart.384 P. Lhakhang et al.
detailed instructions on why and how to perform the behavior (BCT 8). Risk perception:
General information about the behavioral risk, and were asked to anticipate three risksof not ﬂossing the teeth, with the example “A risk of not ﬂossing is getting periodontal
diseases ”(BCTs 1 and 2). Outcome expectancies: the information about the bene ﬁts and
costs of action or inaction, and were asked to speci ﬁcally visualize four bene ﬁts of
ﬂossing such as “If Iﬂoss my teeth daily, then I will have healthier teeth for most of
my life ”. Behavioral intention: ﬁnally, they received a prompt to intention formation,
encouraging the person to decide to act or set a general goal, for example, to make abehavioral resolution such as “I will ﬂoss two times every day ”(BCT 4).
In the self-regulatory condition , participants received an intervention package that
focused on self-ef ﬁcacy, planning, and action control, following BCT 10, a prompt for
speciﬁc goal setting, i.e. participants were asked speci ﬁcally to generate plans for three
occasions with specifying the frequency, time, how often, and how self-ef ﬁcacious they
are to ﬂoss their teeth. Moreover, they were asked to generate three critical situations
which may impede the planned behavior, and coping strategies to overcome the barriersin line with BCT 5 (e.g. “if I forget to ﬂoss, then I put the dental ﬂoss next to my
toothbrush ”). Also, in accordance with BCT 11, they were prompted to review their
goals, by considering previously set intentions. To enhance self-ef ﬁcacy, they responded
to questions such as “How certain are you that you can follow these plans? ”Further-
more, a calendar was provided to ﬁll in their daily ﬂossing records (action control).
The present study provides both conditions to all participants, either in the hypothe-
sized or in the reversed order (AB vs. BA¸ see Figure
2).
Analytical procedure
Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA, type III tests of ﬁxed effects) were
performed with SPSS 22. The two-arm intervention (Sequence 1 vs. Sequence 2) waschosen as a between-subjects factor, whereas ﬂossing, self-ef ﬁcacy, planning, and action
control served as dependent variables, measured at three points in time. Moreover,
ANCOVAs were computed with sequence groups as between-subjects factor and respec-
tive outcomes of ﬂossing, self-ef ﬁcacy, planning, and action control at T2 and T3 as
dependent variables with their corresponding T1 measures as covariates. All assump-tions were tested beforehand such as Levine ’s test of equality of error variances and
Mauchley ’s test of sphericity.

Results
Attrition analyses and missing values
Participants ( n= 19) who discontinued after T2 did not differ signi ﬁcantly on T1 vari-
ables. They were excluded from longitudinal data analyses. Missings were below 1%for dental ﬂossing at T1 and later (T2, T3), self-ef ﬁcacy, planning, and action control at
T3 had about 1% missings, and none at T1 and T2.
Randomization check
Results revealed no baseline differences (see Table
2) between the two experimental
conditions regarding dental ﬂossing, self-ef ﬁcacy, and gender (all p> .05). At T1 a group
difference was found for planning between Sequence 1 ( M= 11.06, SD = 3.40) and
Sequence 2 ( M= 12.28, SD = 3.56), t(203) = −2.49, p= .014 and for action control with
Sequence 1 ( M= 4.14, SD = 2.04) and Sequence 2 ( M= 4.68, SD = 1.87), t(203) = −2.00,
p= .047. Analyses involving group differences following the ﬁrst intervention session
has used T1 measures as covariates.
Descriptive statistics
At baseline, only 6.5% of participants in both conditions reported using dental ﬂoss which
indicates that there is a lack of oral hygiene even among this highly educated sample.
Intervention effects
To describe changes in the two intervention sequences across three points in time,
repeated measures ANOVAs were computed for ﬂossing and the three social-cognitive

(two-tailed) was performed comparing the two intervention groups. Means, standarddeviations, and group comparison statistics are summarized in Table

Figures 3–6.
Changes in dental ﬂossing
A repeated measures ANOVA was applied with ﬂossing as the dependent variable at
three points in time, and group as between-subjects factor. An effect of time emerged,F(2, 396) = 160.73, p<.001, η
2= .45 and a treatment effect as well, F(1, 198) = 6.02,
p< .05, η2= .03. Moreover, there was an interaction between treatment and time,
F(2, 396) = 76.62, p< .001, η2= .28, (see Figure 3), participants ﬂossed more often
when treated with the self-regulatory intervention than when treated with the
motivational condition.
In Intervention Sequence 1, ﬂossing increased (.33 times ﬂossing/day at T2 com-
pared to 1.78 times ﬂossing/day at T3). However, in Sequence 2, ﬂossing showed a
slight downward trend (1.53 times ﬂossing/day at T2 compared to 1.18 times ﬂossing/
day at T3). Group differences in ﬂossing at T2 were also tested with ANCOVA, control-
ling for the baseline. Sequence 2 with the self-regulation intervention had obtained ahigher level of behavior change ( M= 1.53, SE = .06) than Sequence 1 with motivation
intervention ( M= .33, SE = .07) with F(1, 199) = 181.32, p< .001, η
2= .48. At T3,
ANCOVA yielded F(1, 198) = 17.84, p< .001, η2= .08. Sequence 1 had higher ﬂossing
levels ( M= 1.79, SE = .11) after the self-regulatory intervention than Sequence 2
(M= 1.18, SD = .10) after completing the motivational intervention.
Changes in self-ef ﬁcacy
For self-ef ﬁcacy, there was an overall treatment effect, F(1, 201) = 4.18, p< .05,
η2= .02 and an effect of time, F(2, 402) = 97.45, p< .001, η2= .33. An interaction

between treatment and time emerged, F(2, 402) = 15.97, p< .001, η2= .07. Figure 4
displays the patterns of differences in self-ef ﬁcacy changes. Group differences in self-
efﬁcacy at T2 were also tested with ANCOVA, controlling for the baseline. Sequence 2
with the self-regulation intervention had obtained a higher level of self-ef ﬁcacy
(M= 17.08, SE = .27) than Sequence 1 with the motivation intervention ( M= 14.56,
SE = .29) with F(1, 202) = 41.06, p< .001, η2= .17. At T3, ANCOVA yielded F(1,
200) = 16.29, p< .001, η2= .08. Sequence 1 had higher self-ef ﬁcacy levels ( M= 19.24,
SE = .31) after the self-regulatory intervention than Sequence 2 ( M= 18.07, SE = .29)
after the motivational intervention.
Changes in planning
In planning, an effect of time appeared with F(2, 402) = 247.15, p< .001, η2= .55
and a treatment effect, F(1, 201) = 56.88, p< .001. η2= .22. Moreover, a signi ﬁcant
interaction effect between the treatment and time was found, F(2, 402) = 88.10,
p< .001, η2= .31 (see Figure 5). Group differences in planning at T2 were also
tested with ANCOVA, controlling for the baseline. Sequence 2 with the self-regula-tion intervention had obtained a higher level of planning ( M= 17.00, SE = .26)
than Sequence 1 with the motivation intervention ( M= 11.05, SE = .28) with F(1,
202) = 234.50, p< .001, η
2= .54. At T3, ANCOVA yielded F(1, 200) = 10.48,
p< .01, η2= .05. Although Sequence 1 had higher planning levels ( M= 18.22,
SE = .30) after the self-regulatory intervention than Sequence 2 ( M= 17.26,
SE = .28) after the motivation intervention, however this difference yielded only a
signiﬁcance level of p=. 0 6 .

tion).388 P. Lhakhang et al.
Changes in action control
For action control, an effect of time emerged F(2, 402) = 61.60, p< .001, η2= .24 and
a treatment effect F(1, 201) = 20.73, p< .001, η2= .09. Furthermore, an interaction
between treatment and time was found, F(2, 402) = 11.59, p< .001, η2= .06 (see
Figure 6). Group differences in action control at T2 were also tested with ANCOVA,
controlling for the baseline, and Sequence 2 with the self-regulation intervention hadobtained a higher level of action control ( M= 5.85, SE = .15) than Sequence 1 with the
motivation intervention ( M= 4.46, SE = .17) with F(1 ,202) = 38.29, p< .001, η
2= .16.
At T3, ANCOVA yielded F(1, 200) = .48, p= .49. Sequence 1 had the same level of
action control ( M= 5.97, SE = .14) after the self-regulatory intervention as Sequence 2
(M= 6.05, SE = .13) after the motivational intervention.
Discussion
This study has examined the effects of an oral self-care intervention in different
sequences. In Sequence 1, participants received ﬁrst the motivation, then the self-regula-
tion intervention. In Sequence 2, they received ﬁrst the self-regulation, then the motiva-
tion intervention. Pre-post comparisons have shown that both groups of participantshave improved their oral self-care as re ﬂected by attaining higher levels of dental ﬂoss-
ing (Hypothesis 1 supported). They also showed a general increase in self-ef ﬁcacy, plan-
ning, and action control. However, participants in Sequence 1 did not demonstrate asuperior pattern of gains over the entire time period in terms of ﬂossing, self-ef ﬁcacy,
planning, and action control, as compared with participants in Sequence 2 (Hypothesis
2 rejected). While participants were in the self-regulation condition, they gained more in
terms of the four outcome variables than while being in the motivation condition(Hypothesis 3 supported).

tion).Psychology, Health & Medicine 389
The main differences emerged at T2 which was the point in time when both groups
were exposed either to the motivational or the self-regulatory one. At T2, there was aclear superiority of the self-regulatory intervention in terms of all four outcomes. Thissubstantial group difference vanished at T3, after all participants had been exposed toboth kinds of interventions.
This research demonstrates that a motivational intervention in itself is not suf ﬁcient
for behavior change. The more successful approach lies in the acquisition of self-regula-
tory skills and the development of con ﬁdence in one ’s agency. In the present context,
this could be done even without any motivational preludes. Combining self-ef ﬁcacy,
planning, and action control allowed to build up a self-regulatory process that was docu-mented in terms of ﬂossing frequency and also in terms of the indicators of the three
intervention ingredients.
Although the health promotion program as a whole has turned out to be effective
which justi ﬁes its use, it does not allow to identify active ingredients. Another limitation
was the lack of objective measures to assess progress in ﬂossing. Assessments were
self-reported, and dental ﬂossing was measured retrospectively. One could use ongoing
behavioral assessments such as a dental calendar that allow for constant record keeping(Schüz et al.,
2007 ), but here the calendars were used as one of the intervention compo-
nents under the self-regulatory condition but not as a daily assessment tool.
As the baseline weekly ﬂossing rate was almost zero, it was assumed that almost
all participants were initially unmotivated to adopt ﬂossing. Therefore, no distinction
was made among participants in terms of intenders, non-intenders, and actors ofﬂossing. Future work should consider a segmentation of the audience in terms of
non-intenders, intenders, and actors (Schwarzer,
2008 ) and matched versus mis-
matched interventions.

Theory-based intervention packages were found to work in one sequence as well as
in the other although only the self-regulatory intervention made the difference. However,the motivational intervention may have not been strong enough to show its potential,and future research may want to build more powerful packages along with more mea-
surement points in time to better monitor the effects at each stage. Overall, this study
used a theory-based intervention design and has explored in a unique way the sequenc-ing of different health behavior change techniques in the context of oral self-care, usingdental ﬂossing as an example. Thus, the present data may contribute to research on the
sequencing of health behavior intervention components in general.
