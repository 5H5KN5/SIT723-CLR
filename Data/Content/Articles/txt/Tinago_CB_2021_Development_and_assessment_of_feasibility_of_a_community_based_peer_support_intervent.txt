Abstract
Background: Adolescent mothers in Zimbabwe often experience stigma, isolation, and lack coping skills and
resources to successfully navigate motherhood. Social isolation and stigma are linked to poor mental health
outcomes. No interventions currently address mental health of adolescent mothers in Zimbabwe. Peer support
groups in other contexts have been effective at increasing social connectedness, self-esteem, and self-efficacy,
providing coping mechanisms to manage stigma experiences, in addition to empowering and improving mental
health of adolescents and adolescent mothers. To develop a community-based peer support intervention, we
aimed to understand the unique needs of adolescent mothers, how peer support groups could address those
needs, and the feasibility of implementing the intervention.
Methods: Focus group discussions were conducted with 86 adolescent mothers aged 14 –18 years, 24 community
health workers, and 25 key community stakeholders in a low-income high-density community in Harare. Data were
analyzed thematically using NVivo 12 software.
Results: Participants described adolescent mother experiences with stigma and social isolation, in addition to challenges
including gossip, lack of employment and educational opportunities, and gaps in services and programming. Peer support
groups for adolescent mothers were welcomed to improve men tal health, social support, kn owledge sharing, and skills
building. Participants identified varying preferred frequen cy and duration of group session s addressing topics including
income generation, mental health, and g ossip, facilitated by community health workers at health and community centers.
The use of WhatsApp Messenger to support intervention effor ts was welcomed as an affordable and user-friendly platform
to share information. Implementation (i.e. , training, supervision, frequency, location, and co-facilitation) was feasible.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15Adolescent mothers in Zimbabwe experience
challenges that stem from social isolation and stigma
and negatively influence health. Adolescent mothers
and community members endorse a peer support
intervention for improving the mental health of
adolescent mothers.
/C15This study solicited perspectives from adolescent
mothers, health workers, and key community
members to inform the development of a
peer support intervention that was subsequently
piloted by the study team.
/C15Implementation of the intervention regarding
training and supervision of facilitators and
frequency, location, and co-facilitation of the
peer support groups was feasible.
Background
Almost a quarter of adolescent girls aged 15 –19 years in
Zimbabwe have begun childbearing [ 1]. These pregnan-
cies are often unintended, due to early marriage, sexual
abuse, or risky sexual behavior [ 2]. There is stigma re-
lated to adolescent pregnancy and motherhood in
Zimbabwe with adolescent mothers often feeling isolated
due to lack of social support with a loss of social net-
works and educational opportunities. Adolescent preg-
nancy in Zimbabwe leads to dropping out of school
(19.4%), being abandoned by friends (4.9%) and the per-
son responsible for the pregnancy (9.1%), and/or being
forced to leave home (57.7%) and marry at a young age
(24.5%) [ 1,2]. In Zimbabwe, adolescent mothers dis-
missed from school have difficulty returning to the edu-
cational system. The stigma of adolescent pregnancy and
motherhood is well documented in both developing and
developed countries with stigma experienced from both
within the family, from peers, institutions such as
schools and health facilities and by the community at
large [ 3–6].
Social isolation and stigma are linked to poorer mental
health outcomes such as increased depressive and anxiety
symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts [ 3,4,7].
Adolescent mothers may also lack coping skills and re-
sources to successfully navigate motherhood [ 3,5,6]. Un-
less addressed, these circumstances may have negative
consequences for the mental health of the adolescent
mother and downstream consequences for her child.Zimbabwe has a prevalence above 20% for common
mental disorders. Depression and anxiety are reported in
over 25% of those attending primary health and maternal
services and in up to 30% of females in the community
[8–10]. The peak onset of depression occurs between
adolescence and young adulthood [ 11,12]. Early-onset
depression has a 60 –70% risk of continuing into adult-
hood [ 13]. Adolescents suffering from depression are at
greater risk for self-harm, conduct disorders, delin-
quency, and high-risk behaviors such as substance use
and early sexual debut [ 14–16]. The national prevalence
of depression among Zimbabwean adolescents is un-
known [ 17]. The prevalence of suicide ideation among
school-going adolescents in Zimbabwe is 21.6% [ 18].
Zimbabwe faces human-resource shortages for mental
neurological and substance use disorders and care with
only 12 psychiatrists and 16 psychologists [ 19]. The num-
ber of programs and interventions that address adolescent
mental health in Zimbabwe is limited, and these target
children and adolescents with HIV [ 20]. No interventions
target adolescent mothers. Programs and interventions are
needed to prevent early pregnancies, meet the needs of
adolescent mothers, and improve their health.
Globally, peer support group interventions have been ef-
fective at increasing social connectedness, self-esteem, and
self-efficacy, providing coping mechanisms to manage stigma
experiences, in addition to emp owering and improving ado-
lescent and adolescent mother mental health and emotional
well-being [ 21–27]. Peer support groups provide a platform
for knowledge and experience sharing to provide emotional,
social and practical support [ 21–27]. Peer support groups
implemented virtually via mobile messaging apps or online
platforms have also documented increased social connected-
ness, stigma coping mechanisms , and positive mental health
and social support outcomes for adolescents and adolescent
mothers [ 27,28]. In a peer support intervention based on
mobile phones where adolescent mothers in Canada received
support from a trained peer mentor by voice calling or text
messaging during their last trimester of pregnancy
and 12 weeks postpartum, participants in the inter-
vention group demonstrated lower mean depression
scores at 12 weeks postpartum compared to partici-
pants in the control group [ 28].
Participatory program development leads to better up-
take and alignment with local institutional capacities and
resources [ 29]. Interventions such as the Paying Attention
to Self-intervention in Australia that involved adolescentsTinago et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:110 Page 2 of 12
in the development and implementation of these groups,
in addition to involving other key social networks such as
family members, were also successful at improving adoles-
cent mental health and emotional well-being [ 23].
Because most interventions for adolescent mothers
have been conducted in high-income countries, little is
known about whether such interventions will similarly
improve mental health in low- and middle-income coun-
tries. A limitation of completed programs in high-
income countries has been not having feedback from
participants who leave the interventions [ 29].
To develop a community-based peer support interven-
tion to mitigate social isolation and stigma of adolescent
motherhood and improve mental health of adolescent
mothers in Harare, Zimbabwe, we conducted participa-
tory formative research with adolescent mothers, com-
munity health workers and community members, aiming
to understand 1) the unique needs of adolescent
mothers, 2) how, from participant perspectives, peer
support groups could address those needs, and 3) the
feasibility of implementing the developed intervention.
Methodology
Setting
Zimbabwe is in south-east Africa and has a population
of 12,973,808 (51.9% females) [ 30]. The study was con-
ducted in a high-density, low-income, peri-urban com-
munity in Harare. English is the official language of
Zimbabwe, and Shona is the main local language in
Harare.
Design
A qualitative descriptive research design with an emic
orientation was used with focus group discussions
(FGDs) to learn about participants ’perspectives con-
cerning specific topics that could be addressed through a
peer support group for adolescent mothers (14 –18 years)
and the preferred structure and methods for conducting
the groups [ 31,32]. The reporting of qualitative research
follows the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualita-
tive Research [ 33].
Sample
The sample was 86 adolescent mothers (pregnant and/
or have a child or children) aged 14 –18 years living in
the study community (10 FGDs), 24 community health
workers (CHWs) who worked in the study community
(3 FGDs), and 25 key community stakeholders in the
study community consisting of teachers, family mem-
bers of adolescent mothers, health officials, and reli-
gious leaders (2 FGDs). Thematic saturation was
expected based on previous qualitative studies in simi-
lar populations with a sample size of at least 24 partici-
pants [ 34,35].Recruitment
The purposive sample was recruited in locations such as
community centers, pre- and postnatal clinics, and
churches. Participants were recruited by CHWs and
through fliers and snowball sampling. Participants were
screened for eligibility to participate in the FGDs, with
the criteria being (a) adolescent mothers (pregnant and/
or have a child or children) aged 14 –18 years living in
the study community, (b) CHWs who worked in the
study community, and (c) key community stakeholders
in the study community consisting of teachers, family
members of adolescent mothers, healthcare workers,
health officials, and religious leaders. Participants were
provided with a consent form that disclosed the creden-
tials and positions of the study team and explained what
the data would be used for and the intended outcome of
the study. Participants provided written consent; add-
itional parental or guardian consent was provided for
participants aged 14 –17 years.
Data collection
FGDs with 135 adolescent mothers, CHWs, and key
community stakeholders were conducted between Octo-
ber–December 2018 to determine the peer support
group structure, topics for discussion, meeting times,
and frequency. A FGD guide (with open-ended ques-
tions and subsequent probes), socio-demographic survey,
and consent and assent forms were developed in English
and professionally translated to Shona. The study team
identified WhatsApp as a feasible platform through
which to deliver intervention components in a previous
study with adolescent females in the same study com-
munity, so a portion of the FGDs focused on local usage
of WhatsApp to confirm its feasibility. The FGD guide
was pretested in October 2018 and revised to ensure
comprehension of questions. FGD questions included
1) when you think about the health of adolescent
mothers, what comes to mind? 2) what can be done to
improve the health of adolescent mothers in your com-
m u n i t y ?3 )i ft h e r ew a sap e e rs u p p o r tg r o u pf o ra d o l e s -
cent mothers, what would this group look like? Further
questions asked who should be involved; what informa-
tion and resources would be helpful; who should be tar-
geted; who should deliver information and resources; by
whom, where, and when should they be delivered; length
and frequency of sessions; and what the groups should be
called. Feasibility, i.e., how well technical complexity and
capacity matched, was assessed through the FGD with
CHWs by asking about sufficiency of purpose of training
and supervisory support pro vided and challenges they
encountered regarding the frequency, location, or co-
facilitation of the groups [ 36].
FGDs were conducted at the community clinic and
community hall. After providing consent or assent,Tinago et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:110 Page 3 of 12
participants completed a brief interviewer-administered
socio-demographic survey immediately prior to the
FGD. FGDs were 60 min each with 6 –12 participants in
each group. Only the study team and participants were
present during the FGDs. Field notes were taken during
and immediately following the FGDs. FGD data were
collected by the project coordinator, principal investiga-
tor, and a trained research assistant who are female and
fluent in Shona and English. Study team members have
undergraduate and/or post-graduate training in qualita-
tive methods and have experience conducting qualitative
research. FGDs were audio-recorded, professionally tran-
scribed verbatim, and translated to English.
Data analysis
Socio-demographic data were analyzed with Stata 13.
Transcripts were analyzed thematically between Novem-
ber 2018 and May 2019 using NVivo 12 software [ 37].
The coding process was both inductive and deductive
[37]. The principal investigator and two trained research
assistants developed an initial codebook with deductive
codes based on questions asked in the FGD guide related
to the format of the peer support groups. The data ana-
lysts then coded 4 transcripts with the initial codebook
and open coded these transcripts with any new codes
that emerged. Data analysis meetings were conducted to
discuss and revise the preliminary code book with the
inductive and deductive codes. The data analysts then
recoded the initial 4 transcripts and an additional 7 tran-
scripts with the revised code book. Weekly data analysis
meetings continued, and the codebook was revised based
on the additional coding until saturation was reached.
Interviewer and data analyst triangulation was used to
prevent threats to validity inherent in using a single
interviewer and data analyst [ 38]. Participant quotes are
identified by FGD number and participant type, and ab-
breviations are used to identify adolescent mother (AM),
community health worker (CHW), and key community
stakeholder (KCS).
Results
Sample characteristics
Adolescent mothers (n=86)
The mean age was 17.6 years (range 15 –18), and most
were of Shona ethnicity (96.5%) (Table 1). Most were in
married monogamous relationships (54.7%) and received
high school education between Form 1 and 4 (82.6%);
41.2% were Pentecostal, 50% were dependent on their
partner/family for income, and 88.4% had a previous
pregnancy. Most had other children (74.4%), and the
average number of other children was 1.1 (range 0 –4),
and 40.7% gave birth to their recent child in the hospital.
Fewer were pregnant at the time of screening (17.4%),
and most families knew of the pregnancy (86.7%). Themean months pregnant was 5.8, and 53.3% had attended
an antenatal care visit with the first visit occurring on
average at 4.6 months. Mean number of visits was 2.4
(range 1 –4) and 50% attended a monthly visit. Most had
a cell phone (73.3%) and used WhatsApp (58.7%).
Community health workers (n=24)
Mean age was 60.3 years (range 37 –77) and 37.5% were
Protestant. Most were widowed (58.3%), females (95.8%),
of Shona ethnicity (100.0%) that resided in the study
community (83.3%). Most had other education (62.5%),
followed by high school form 1 –4 education (16.7%).
They had an average of 27.9 years of experience as a
community health worker (range 15 –32) who worked
with young women (96.0%).
Key community stakeholders (n=25)
The mean age was 45.7 years (range 18 –61), most were
women (76.0%), of Shona ethnicity (92.0%), and resided
in the study community (92.0%); 28.0% were Pentecostal,
and 28.0% were monogamously married. Most had a
high school form 1 –4 education (80.0%) and were not
currently employed (76.0%); 44.0% worked with young
women, and 60.0% had a female child of their own.
The challenges of adolescent motherhood
Most participants described adolescent motherhood in
terms of the challenges of adolescent motherhood that
stemmed from experiences with social isolation and
stigma and led to feelings of social disconnectedness,
disempowerment, lack of control, abuse, risky behaviors,
and poor health. Participants described challenges that
centered on poverty and lack of employment opportun-
ities with negative influences on health. An adolescent
mother stated, “Most of the time we won ’th a v ea n y
money ”(AM, Group 5). The lack of money was often a re-
sult of most adolescent mothers not finishing their educa-
tion due to expulsion from school for their adolescent
pregnancy or lack of family financial support to continue
their education which then limited their employment
prospects. A key community stakeholder explained:
Another issue is that these adolescents have not
completed their education. So their brains, if they
had gone maybe up to form 4, O Level (high school
grade 11) they would have been mature and by go-
ing to school we meet teachers and learn different
things. So being uneducated is also a problem again
because they won ’t really know what the future
holds …If they could be taken back to school it
would be nice. (KCS, Group 2)

behaviors and poor health with a community healthTinago et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:110 Page 4 of 12

worker stating, “I think the main issue is on poverty, this
will lead them to do everything and anything. They see
what others would be having and start saying how can I
get that. They end up getting into difficult positions
which she was not supposed to due to poverty ”(CHW,
Group 1). These difficult positions included substance
abuse and risky behaviors for financial compensation. A
community health worker described:Health with regards to adolescent mothers what we
see is that they don ’t do good to themselves, if they
see that they have been given a child, let ’s say they
are a single mother, they no longer take care of
themselves. They start smoking and drinking beer,
they may actually go to beer halls thinking that they
may get something, the beer hall is not good for
health. They may find a lot of things that willTable 1 Socio-demographic characteristics of focus group study participants ( N=135) (Continued)

trouble them, smoking will cause her to be sick and
having so many boyfriends will cause her to be in-
fected (with HIV). (CHW, Group1)
An adolescent mother added, “Our health can be af-
fected through worrying on how we can take care of our
children, money is a problem. Others don ’t have any-
thing to do that can give us money so our health can be
affected through thinking about getting something to
do”(AM, Group 10). Another adolescent mother added,
“I think if adolescent mothers can work for themselves
their health would be improved ”(AM, Group 7) while a
key community stakeholder described, “Something
should be done for women for them to be able to earn a
living and to empower them. We need to be taken to an-
other level, out of the mud that we are currently in ”
(KCS, Group 2).
Participants also described challenges with adolescent
motherhood due to marriages with a participant stat-
ing, “If you have your own money that would be bet-
ter, a lot are not getting into marriages by choice, it is
driven by that idea that maybe my life will be changed
but you end up seeing that your life is actually getting
worse ”(AM, Group 4). The participant was referring
to the cultural practice of brides price or “lobola ”paid
by the groom to the bride ’s family. Another adolescent
mother added:
It’s so difficult to be a mother while you are still
young because what you face in the marriage, its
different from someone who is married at 25 years,
that person will be mature and knowledgeable. You
might come across a situation let ’s say the husband
does not go to work, it becomes difficult for you as
you have to provide for yourself. So it is so difficult
being a mother while you are still young …life is just
difficult if you are the mother of the house. (AM,
Group 8)
Experiences with stigma and social isolation from fam-
ily, peers, partners, and community members and their
influence on health were also provided by participants as
they described being chased away from home by rela-
tives, being left by the person who impregnated them,
and abuse as negatively affecting adolescent mother ’s
mental health. An adolescent mother stated, “To be im-
pregnated and someone leaves you is such a painful
thing so you won ’t have mental stability ”(AM, Group
7). Another adolescent mother described, “Being abused
by a husband can cause you to have bad mental health,
you will always think about what your tomorrow will be
like if I spend of my days being abused and beaten, it
causes you to be always thinking ”(AM, Group 1). A
community health worker added:The other thing that causes them not to run to rela-
tives is because they are too harsh with them. She
would have gone to tell them about her situation,
and she is beaten up. She is chased away from the
house and is told to go back to the boyfriend who
may not be stable. The adolescent mother becomes
stress that is when you see her becoming suicidal or
hurting herself because she will be overwhelmed
with the problem, the relatives would have chased
her away. That is why she looks for refuge outside
to us as community health workers because she
knows that we will give her advice on way forward.
(CHW, Group 1)
Gaps in adolescent mother services and programming
Most participants identified gaps in services and pro-
gramming for adolescent mothers in their community.
An adolescent mother stated, “There is need even for
building of play centers where people can meet and
socialize relieving their stress as women ”(AM, Group 1)
and another added:
If they could get some projects that they can do as
this reduces their stress because if you are at work
you are occupied with what you have to do than
spending the whole day seated, that ’s when you start
having stress …So if you have something to occupy
you that would be better. (AM, Group 1)
Peer support groups for adolescent mothers were wel-
comed to meet needs of adolescent mothers and engage
them in activities with peers for social support, problem-
solving, knowledge sharing, and skills building. An adoles-
cent mother stated, “I think us as young people should get
the opportunity to get into groups educating each other,
people giving each other advice. I think that will help us as
adolescent mothers on how we can live ”(AM, Group 8).
A key community stakeholder explained:
I think support groups is something they would
really like because they know that they will get
something out of it. You don ’t get something while
you are just seated at home, you can only get this
when you are in groups. Forming support groups is
a good way we can mobilize these children. (KCS,
Group 1)
Peer support group structure
Facilitators
Participants described that peer support groups should
be delivered by trusted and informed people such as
nurses and adults with health knowledge. An adolescent
mother stated, “These can be delivered by someone
whom we trust that they can get back to us with anTinago et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:110 Page 7 of 12
answer, we would have put all our trust in that person ”
(AM, Group 6). Another adolescent mother added, “The
nurse from the clinic should be able to help us ”(AM,
Group 6), while another explained, “I think we would
need adults who know about health ”(AM, Group 3).
Key community stakeholders reiterated the need for
older adults to facilitate the groups with a stakeholder
stating, “Older women and even men can be part of the
group...if there are adults in there, there will be some
order ”(KCS, Group 1).
Location
Most participants preferred that the peer support groups
be conducted at the local clinic, “They should be deliv-
ered here at the clinic ”(AM, Group 5). Participants de-
scribed clinics, along with community hall, schools, and
churches, as central and trusted settings.
Frequency
The preferred frequency of peer support group sessions
varied from meeting every day to once a month. An ado-
lescent mother stated, “I think it should be done on a
monthly basis ”(AM, Group 3), while another explained,
“If we are brought together as young people and we
meet at least twice per week we can be able to learn, get
to know each other and share information ”(AM, Group
5). Another adolescent mother described, “I think every
week, let ’s say we meet once a week, by the end of the
month we would know that we have four days that we
meet educating and encouraging each other, doing our
things as a unit ”(AM, Group 8).
Duration
Participants described that peer support groups should
meet about two hours at a time, over varying periods of
time. Responding to how long peer support groups
should be offered, an adolescent mother replied, “Two
hours ”(AM, Group 3). Participants wanted the peer
support groups to be offered continuously with an ado-
lescent mother describing, “As long as forever, the whole
life because more and more adolescent mothers are be-
ing added every day ”(AM, Group 1). Another adoles-
cent mother added, “We would want them to be around
for a long time so that they can assist even other adoles-
cent mothers who will come after us ”(AM, Group 10).
Shorter term group meetings were also described with
adolescent mothers suggesting that groups, “…can go to
up to a year ”(AM, Group 2) and “6 months ”(AM,
Group 4).
Topics
Participants described topics that included income gen-
eration, life skills, sexual health, mental health, gossip,
hygiene, abuse, and breastfeeding. An adolescent motherdescribed, “We would like to be helped with money so
that we can be able to carry out these projects for a liv-
ing”(AM, Group 10). Empowerment by means of in-
come generation and collaboration was described a way
to increase their locus of control and support them-
selves. A community health worker added, “I think if
projects could be done for them so that they may have
time to come together doing something together and
their minds can be stabilized as they work for them-
selves, I think that could work. Because some of them
do not know how to work for themselves ”(CHW, Group
1). Participants described how risky behaviors could be
prevented with additional knowledge on substance abuse
and risky sexual behavior. An adolescent mother stated,
“Maybe on drug abstinence because many adolescent
mothers are now abusing drugs ”(AM, Group 7). A key
community stakeholder added, “I think on sexual and re-
productive health, which is one topic that is very import-
ant for these young people ”(KCS, Group 1).
Adolescent mothers described rumors spread about
them and personal information shared without their
consent through gossip as interfering with their commu-
nication with peers and community members. Gossip
was also characterized as a contributor to the stigma of
being an adolescent mother along with experiences of
social isolation and depressive symptoms. An adolescent
mother described:
If you hear something, let ’s say your brother ’s
daughter has come to tell you her problem, you
should not say as soon as she tells you, you are tak-
ing that to the next person. Then you hear that
from so and so to say we heard this about you, that
way we won ’t be in good books with each other. So
what we are asking is if you could go out there and
educate them that they should not say if we come
with our problems to them they go out spreading
the word, selling it everywhere. (AM, Group 9)
Another adolescent mother explained:
You are walking in the road and you approach a
group …you fear to say “should I pass through ”or I
should change the route because they will remain
behind talking about me. They may even talk loudly
so that you can hear and laugh at you. This can ac-
tually cause pain in you to the extent that you regret
why you used that route. (AM, Group 1)
Adolescent mothers described gossip as leading to
mistrust with an adolescent mother stating, “As for
me…to tell my relative or to share my problems with
them, they will share my secret. They are a gossiper ”
(AM, Group 1). Another adolescent mother stated thatTinago et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:110 Page 8 of 12
the reason she did not share information with adults in
her life was because “some of them don ’t keep secrets ”
(AM, Group 6).
Name
Most participants named the peer support groups
“Young Women of Today ”(Madzimai eChidiki Anhasi )
to emphasize their identity as young women first, then
mothers who face current issues.
WhatsApp Messenger use
Likes of WhatsApp
Use of WhatsApp Messenger to support intervention ef-
forts was welcomed by most participants. Features that
participants liked about WhatsApp were its ease of com-
munication and affordability; how it allows information
to travel fast; and the ability connect with others to
share ideas, problem solve, get help, and participate in
group discussions, provide amusement, and learn. An
adolescent mother explained, “If someone has encoun-
tered a problem at home we could use the WhatsApp
groups to share ideas, people can help you here and
there without waiting to meet in person, people can as-
sist you fast ”(AM, Group 1). Another adolescent mother
added, “WhatsApp is good because if you don ’t have
enough money to phone you can talk through What-
sApp because if you juice up a dollar you can go for a
week talking ”(AM, Group 2).
Dislikes of WhatsApp
Features that most participants disliked about WhatsApp
were chain messages, inappropriate messages, network
challenges, identification of phone number, overuse, hack-
ing of account, and its role in spreading misinformation.
An adolescent mother stated, “Someone might actually be
saying bad things in those groups which does not go in
line with the purpose of the group ”(AM, Group 3), while
another added, “Bad influence, gossip, sharing bad videos ”
(AM, Group 4). A community health worker explained, “I
don’t like chain messages and some messages you just
delete before reading ”(CHW, Group 1).
Frequency of WhatsApp use
Participant dislikes about WhatsApp did not limit their
use of WhatsApp. WhatsApp Messenger was used fre-
quently among those who had the messaging app with
adolescent mothers stating they used WhatsApp “The
whole day ”(AM, Group 1) and “I think I can use it for
almost 14 hours of my day ”(AM, Group 2). The fre-
quent use of WhatsApp was a way to increase their so-
cial connectedness and as a resource for information
and entertainment.Reasons for WhatsApp use
Most participants described that they used WhatsApp
for communicating with family and friends, church
groups, and for learning and current affairs/news. An
adolescent mother stated, “Most of the time I will be
talking to people in our church group ”(AM, Group 8)
and another added, “I have WhatsApp groups from
church where we are updated on what is happening,
family groups and other relatives. It is easy to communi-
cate with than phoning ”(AM, Group 1). An adolescent
mother stated, “I have a number of groups that I am part
of, for novels and cooking. So if I see that I have re-
ceived quite a number of messages on the novels, I
switch off data and start going through the novels. I can
also copy a recipe that I want from the group ”(AM,
Group 6). Another adolescent mother explained:
We can use it telling each other good information.
Like what we were saying if there is one of us who
has got a challenge, she can share it on the group.
As adolescent mothers we should encourage each
other, not laugh at her. That is what we would like
to use WhatsApp for, to encourage each other as
young people. (AM, Group 5)
Feasibility of implementation
Facilitators reported that the detailed training and super-
visory support provided (both in-person and via What-
sApp) were sufficient for purposes, and reported no
significant challenges related to the frequency, location,
or co-facilitation of the groups. All expressed a strong
desire for the intervention to continue.
Discussion
Participants described the challenges of adolescent
motherhood that included poverty and lack of employ-
ment opportunities, early marriages, being chased away
from home by relatives, being left by the person who im-
pregnated them, and abuse. Participants also identified
gaps in services and programming for adolescent
mothers in their community.
Peer support groups for adolescent mothers were
welcomed to meet social support, health, coping, em-
powerment, skills building, and educational needs of
adolescent mothers. Participants identified potential
topics that included income generation, gossip, mental
health, sexual and reproductive health, abuse, and hy-
giene. Income generation was the most stated topic and
was related to participants ’inability to continue their
education and thus find employment to support them-
selves and their families. Similarly, Carbone and col-
leagues (2019) used FGDs with adolescent mothers aged
15–19 in Malawi to inform the development of a pro-
gram to educate on the prevention of mother-to-childTinago et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:110 Page 9 of 12
transmission of HIV [ 39]. Adolescent mothers in their
study requested education on subjects not directly re-
lated to transmission, such as poverty, food insecurity,
economic disempowerment, and financial dependence,
which were often cited as barriers to care. These findings
corroborate ours about the quest for economic em-
powerment together with health-related interventions
among adolescent mothers in low income settings.
Rumors spread about adolescent mothers and secrets
shared without their consent through gossip from peers
and community members led to adolescent mothers
feeling isolated, stigmatized, and mistrustful. Gossip also
led to adolescent mothers experiencing depressive symp-
toms due to the pain caused by these rumors and viola-
tion of trust. Adolescent mothers in Zambia also found
returning to school difficult due to expulsion,
stigmatization, gossip, and isolation from peers and
community members; discrimination and stigmatization
of adolescent motherhood from the community led
many adolescents into early marriages, with some en-
gaging in risky behaviors such as substance abuse to
cope with stigmatization [ 40].
Participants emphasized that peer support groups
should be delivered by trusted and informed people such
as nurses and adults with health knowledge in trusted set-
tings such as local health and community centers. Com-
munity health workers and community stakeholders
emphasized having an adult facilitate the peer support
groups. The preferred frequency of peer support group
sessions varied from meeting every day to once a month.
Adolescent mothers named the peer support groups
“Young Women of Today ”to emphasize their identity as
young women first, then mothers who face current issues.
Use of the WhatsApp messaging app to support inter-
vention efforts was welcomed as an affordable, conveni-
ent, and user-friendly platform to share information if
the messaging platform was private and not used to
spread gossip, misinformation, and chain messages. Hay
and colleagues (2020) reported similar barriers and facil-
itators to WhatsApp use among mentor mothers with
HIV in the UK with additional barriers related to limited
and costly data storage [ 40]. Henry and colleagues
(2016) implemented a mobile learning intervention to
enhance the supervision of community health workers
with WhatsApp mobile messaging in 2 low-resource set-
tings in Kenya and found that with minimal training,
community health workers and their supervisors were
able to conduct virtual one-to-one, group, and peer-to-
peer supervision via WhatsApp [ 41]. More evidence is
needed to explore the effectiveness of WhatsApp as an
intervention tool.
A limitation of our study is that the perspectives re-
ported in the focus groups may incompletely convey the
needs of individual young women. Strengths of our studyinclude the large representative sample of adolescent
mothers, key community stakeholders, and community
health workers who provided community perspectives on
peer support groups for adolescent mothers and the use
of multiple data analysts to offset threats to validity.
Conclusion
Participants welcomed the idea of a community-based
peer support intervention to mitigate social isolation and
stigma of adolescent mothers by way of integrated tech-
nology, peer and community support, empowerment,
skills building, and knowledge sharing. Implementation
of the intervention in terms of frequency, location, and
co-facilitation of the peer-support groups was feasible
and training and supervision of facilitators was sufficient.
Facilitated peer support groups can strengthen social
networks and mitigate the adverse effects of social isola-
tion and stigma among adolescent mothers. Integral to
these efforts is a focus on participatory methods that
empower adolescent mothers to inform the development
of programs and interventions that address their health
and social needs.
