Abstract
Background: There is a well-recognized need for greater use of theory to address research translational gaps.
Normalization Process Theory (NPT) provides a set of sociological tools to understand and explain the social
processes through which new or modified practices of thinking, enacting, and organizing work are implemented,
embedded, and integrated in healthcare and other organizational settings. This review of NPT offers readers the
opportunity to observe how, and in what areas, a particular theoretical approach to implementation is being used.
In this article we review the literature on NPT in order to understand what interventions NPT is being used to
analyze, how NPT is being operationalized, and the reported benefits, if any, of using NPT.
Methods: Using a framework analysis approach, we conducted a qualitative systematic review of peer-reviewed
literature using NPT. We searched 12 electronic databases and all citations linked to six key NPT development
papers. Grey literature/unpublished studies were not sought. Limitations of English language, healthcare setting and
year of publication 2006 to June 2012 were set.
Results: Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria; in the main, NPT is being applied to qualitatively analyze a
diverse range of complex interventions, many beyond its original field of e-health and telehealth. The NPT
constructs have high stability across settings and, notwithstanding challenges in applying NPT in terms of
managing overlaps between constructs, there is evidence that it is a beneficial heuristic device to explain and guide
implementation processes.
Conclusions: NPT offers a generalizable framework that can be applied across contexts with opportunities for
incremental knowledge gain over time and an explicit framework for analysis, which can explain and potentially
shape implementation processes. This is the first review of NPT in use and it generates an impetus for further and
extended use of NPT. We recommend that in future NPT research, authors should explicate their rationale for
choosing NPT as their theoretical framework and, where possible, involve multiple stakeholders including service
users to enable analysis of implementation from a range of perspectives.

Background
There has been a proliferation of research about research-
practice-policy links in recent decades [1]. In spite of thegrowth in literature, there remains a well-recognized and
significant translational gap between these domains. This
gap has captured the attention of policy makers andresearchers alike, with repeated calls for the greater use of
explicit theory in research that explores implementation
processes [2-4]. The proposed benefits are that theory canoffer us generalizable frameworks that can apply across
differing settings and individuals; the opportunity for in-
cremental accumulation of knowledge; and an explicitframework for analysis [2,5]. Also, using theory may en-
hance our understanding of barriers to implementation,
but more than that, it may enhance our ability to designinterventions and explore mediating pathways to shape
and improve implementation processes [6,7]. It is thus
important both to develop and test new theories that arein use, to appraise their relevance and utility for the field
of implementation research [8-10].
One such new theory presented in the literature is the
Normalization Process Theory (NPT). NPT is a socio-
logical theory that has been widely promoted as a means
to understand implementation, embedding and integra-tion of innovation in healthcare settings, and has been
advocated as a means of bridging the translational gap
[8,10]. It has potential utility as a conceptual frameworkto explore the gap between health research evidence,
policy, and practice because epistemologically, it empha-
sizes the fluid, dynamic and interactive processes betweencontext, actors and objects that is congruent with
interactive and social models of research use [11]; it is
derived from studies seeking to understand the imple-mentation of innovation and complex interventions in
healthcare settings so it is highly attuned to the spe-
cifics of this organizational setting; and it encouragesthe recommended whole-system perspective on imple-
mentation research [3]. In the next section, we provide
an overview of NPT before going on to describe ourresearch objectives and the methods of our review.
From Normalization Process Model (NPM) to Normalization
Process Theory (NPT)
The Normalization Process Model (NPM) was initially
developed as an applied theoretical model to assist clini-cians and researchers to understand and evaluate the fac-
tors that inhibit and promote the routine incorporation
of complex healthcare interventions in practice [12-14].Much of the early work was related to implementation
of e-health applications.
The further empirical applications of the NPM showed
that while it could explain factors that promote and
inhibit ‘collective action ’(i.e., the distribution of work
required among stakeholders and the resources to supportthat), it did not address how participants understood and
came to engage and support a new practice and how they
reflected on and evaluated it. Through the developmentof further constructs (see NPT theoretical constructs
from Finch, Mair, et al.[ 1 5 ] ) ,a c c o u n t i n gf o rh o wp e o p l e
understand and make sense of a practice ( i.e., Coherence),
engage and participate with it ( i.e., Cognitive Participa-
tion), and reflect or appraise its effects ( i.e.,R e f l e x i v e
Monitoring), the model became a theory, i.e.,N P T .F o r
the most part, the term NPT is used through out this
paper, unless otherwise stated.
NPT theoretical constructs (from Finch, Mair et al. )
1.Coherence : the process and work of sense-making
and understanding that individuals and organisations
have to go through in order to promote or inhibit
the routine embedding of a practice.
2.Cognitive Participation : the process and work that
individuals and organisations have to go through in
order to enrol individuals to engage with the new
practice.
3.Collective Action : the work that individuals and
organisations have to do to enact the new practice.
(“Collective Action ”was initially referred to as NPM,
and consisted of four subcomponents (i.e.Contextual Integration (CI), Relational Integration
(RI), Interactional Workability (IW), and Skill Set
Workability (SSW)). For a more detailed descriptionof NPM see May [ 12]).
4.Reflexive Monitoring : the work inherent in the
informal and formal appraisal of a new practice onceit is in use, in order to assess its advantages and
disadvantages, and which develops users ’
comprehension of the effects of a practice.
Since then, the theory ’s development has focused on
building a middle-range theory that explains how materialpractices (the things that people do when they implement
complex healthcare interventions) become routinely em-
bedded in their social contexts as the result of people work-ing, individually and collectively, to enact them [13,14].
Given its sociological origins, NPT is not focused on the
relationship between individual attitudes and intentionsand behavioral outcomes, which is the concern of psycho-
logical theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior
[16]. Like the sociological theory of Communities of Prac-tice [17], NPT does pay attention to how knowledge is
held, transferred, and created within and across profes-
sional groups, but it also seeks to understand the workthat actors (clinicians, implementers, and patients alike)
have to engage in to implement new knowledge in practice
[18,19]. Similar to theories of actor networks and diffusionMcEvoy et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:2 Page 2 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/2
of innovation [20,21], NPT pays attention to the legitim-
acy of the intervention and the role of opinion leaders; it
is concerned with understanding trust and interpersonalrelationships within social networks as they impact on the
introduction of innovation [22,23]. However, NPT extends
beyond the initial introduction of innovation to investigatethe processes by which innovation may become embedded
and routinized in practice, so much so that it becomes
regarded as a normal and taken-for-granted way of work-ing. Among NPT ’s distinctive features is the attention to
all stakeholders ’involvement in implementation processes,
the work that they have to do individually and collectively,and the subtle and gradual processes from embedding and
integrating to normalization [13]. The theory is centered
on understanding social phenomena defined by fourtheoretical constructs, which characterize mechanisms
that are energized by investments made by individuals
and organizations (see Figure 1).
The development of NPT [14] focused on addressing
two key criteria for theory to be ‘useful ’: that it must offer
adequate description and be fit for purpose. Thus, as out-lined by Finch, Mair et al. [15], the theory has been devel-
oped to offer transparent and transferable explanations forthe phenomena of interest (processes of embedding new
practice and ways of working) revealed by empirical
investigation.
There is a growing community of researchers who have
made an a priori choice to use NPT in their research.
Given the aforementioned calls to investigate new theor-ies, we consider it timely to review how this particular
new theory is being operationalized and, importantly, ex-
plore what benefits, if any, are seen to derive from itsutilization. This review of NPT contributes to a body of
knowledge about how theory may benefit implementation
research, and if so what should the research agenda nowbe for NPT and other relevant theories in the field. There-
fore, in this article our research objectives are to review
the literature on NPT (see Additional file 1: PICO Table)in order to understand what interventions NPT is being
used to analyze, how NPT is being operationalized and
the reported benefits, if any, of using NPT.

Search terms and strategy
Utilizing the interface engine EBSCOhost, the first
author (RM) completed an advanced search incorporatingthe following electronic bibliographic databases: Academic
Search Complete; AMED —The Allied and Complementary
Medicine Database; Biomedical Reference Collection:Expanded; CINAHL Plus with Full Text; MEDLINE;
OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W.Wilson); PsycARTICLES;
PsycINFO; Social Sciences Full Text (H.W. Wilson); UKand Ireland Reference Center (see Additional file 2). A
search of both Embase and Pubmed was also carried out.
In the search process, the terms ‘Normalization Process
Theory ’or‘Normalization Process Model ’were used. The
first author (RM) also screened all citations linked to six
key concept papers that were specific to the developmentof the theory/model [10,12-14,24,25]. Citations were also
solicited from academics involved in the development of
NPT. Google Scholar alerts were further activated duringthe search process, which commenced in February 2012
and ended on June 1st 2012. The final list of articles was
then circulated to a number of experts in the field of NPTfor review and no additional papers were noted. The issue
of discrepancies did not arise.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Papers on the subject of ‘Normalization Process Theory ’
or‘Normalization Process Model ’in a health-related
field that met all the following criteria were included:
Published peer-reviewed empirical papers or papers that
may be in press or accepted for publication; and an ex-plicit reference to NPT or NPM in the article heading,
abstract or keywords.
Given the decision to review the application of NPT in
completed empirical work, study protocols, editorials,
discussion/briefing papers, conference papers, or core
concept papers that describe the theory and its develop-ment were not included ( e.g., [13]).
Data abstraction and framework analysis
Citations were downloaded into EndNote reference man-
ager software, and full documents were imported into
NVivo 10 software for analysis.
Given our interest in identifying a priori themes ( i.e.,
the four NPT constructs), we adopted a framework ana-
lysis approach [26]. We also sought out emergent issues(e.g., country of origin, research focus, stakeholder involve-
ment) that were considered relevant to the objectives of
our review.
This framework analysis approach incorporated the
following five key stages: familiarization, identifying a
thematic framework, indexing, charting, and mappingand interpretation. For indexing and charting, the first
author extracted material from any part of the paper
that was relevant to an a priori or emergent theme. Forthe ap r i o r i t h e m e s ,o n l yd a t at h a tw e r ee x p l i c i t l yc o n -
nected to NPT by the authors of the identified papers
were coded.
The final stage of mapping and interpretation focused
primarily on our a priori themes and had two objectives.
First, to examine stability of the constructs across studies,we explored how NPT was being operationalized across
settings. For this we analyzed whether data coded expli-
citly by authors as a particular construct had resonancewith our understanding of that construct as per the core
NPT papers. We also compared authors ’accounts of each
construct as applied to their study setting and any relevantcorresponding data. Given the subjectivity involved in
interpretive analysis processes, our aim was to see if we
could understand authors ’coding decisions rather than
judging them to be ‘correct ’or‘incorrect ’per se. Second,
to determine whether there were any benefits to using
NPT we focused on the authors ’reflections, usually
located in the discussion section of the papers.
The mapping and interpretation of the data, and recom-
mendations, were discussed with all co-authors andrefined until consensus was reached.
Results
Search results
From the 383 records screened, 354 were excluded and29 full-text articles that met the inclusion criteria wereretrieved (see Figure 1) (see Additional file 1: PICO Table).
Due to the qualitative nature of the literature being
reviewed, PICO as a search strategy did not neatly fit withour research questions, so we adapted the PICO Table to
include the following criteria: participants, study design
and collection approach, interventions, analysis, aims/discussion, and outcomes.
Drawing on Hawker, Payne, et al. [27] (see Additional
file 3: Quality Appraisal Tool), each of the 29 papers wassubjected to a quality appraisal process undertaken by
three of the authors (RM, AMacF and LB). This process
enabled us to make an informed decision about the qual-ity of the reported research. All 29 papers were included,
with scores ranging from 18 to 36 (maximum score being
36) and a mean score of 29.06. Study-specific appraisal re-sults are included in Additional file 3. Overall, these were
good quality studies.
To ensure consistency during the data abstraction and
framework analysis phase of work, one-fifth of the articles
were double-coded independently. Coding agreement was
close to 100%.
Findings as per the research objectives
What interventions is NPT being used to analyze?
Of the 29 articles appraised, 21 originated in the UK
(the country of origin for NPT), five in Australia, and
one each in Ireland, South Africa, and The NetherlandsMcEvoy et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:2 Page 4 of 13

(see Table 1). NPT is mainly being used in qualitative
research to study the implementation of complex inter-
ventions that introduce a new way of working in health-care settings (see Table 1). T his includes eight studies
[15,18,28-33] in the field of e-health and telehealthcare
and the remaining 21 studies [5,19,34-52] in severalother healthcare fields, for example chronic health care,
maternity care, and language interpretation services.
Three of the papers reported the use of NPT to informthe development of tools that support implementation
work [15,31,33].
How is NPT being operationalized?
NPT, and its four related constructs, were utilized
in over one-third of the papers reviewed (n = 11)[15,19,28,30-32,34, 35,37,44,45]. One paper [41] focused
solely on the construct of Coherence. The remaining
papers (n = 17) [5,18,29,33,36,38-40,42,43,46-52] focusedsolely on the construct of Collective Action, or NPM as it
was earlier known (see Table 2, column 2).
Our analysis of the application of the constructs across
settings indicates that authors attributed meanings to
each construct that, in general, resonated with our un-
derstanding of the constructs and had veracity in termsof their reported analysis and interpretation of data from
their specific study setting.
For Coherence, there was a clear emphasis on under-
standing and conceptualization of interventions and their
work (n = 8) [15,19,32,34,35,37,41,45];
For Cognitive Participation, the emphasis was on
notions of legitimation and buy-in, both in terms of
the individuals involved and involving others (n = 8)
[15,19,28,32,34,35,37,45];
For Collective Action, the emphasis was on orga-
nizational resources, training and divisions of labor,
confidence and expertise as well as the workabilityof the intervention in clinical interactions (n = 25)
[5,15,18,19,28,29,32-40,42,43,45-52];
For Reflexive Monitoring, the emphasis across studies
was on appraising and monitoring implementation work
(n = 9) [15,19,28,32,34,36,44,48,52].
There were, however, exceptions to this general finding,
which typically related to the overlap between constructs.
For example, in Gunn et al. ’s [45] paper we considered
that data about the doubts practice nurses and recep-tionists had regarding their role in delivering depression
care could fit with Cognitive Participation ’s subcomponent
legitimation ,and could also fit with Collective Action ’s
subcomponent skill set workability ,which relates to the
division of labor and the allocation of tasks. Sanders et al.
[41] also reported all their data about a new system fortreating back pain under Coherence, although for us
much of the data appeared to relate to Collective Action
(because the data were based on data generated withstudy participants based on their experiences of doing
implementation work). However, the main point is that
irrespective of whether the issue fitted best in one con-struct or another, the framework helped to raise important
issues.
In almost all cases NPT was used as an organizing
framework for analyses and reporting findings. It was also
used to inform study/intervention design [5,40,41,44,46],
to generate research questions for fieldwork [39,41,45],and to create tools for investigating and supporting
implementation (TARS and eHIT) [15,31] (see Table 2,
column 3).
As presented within Table 2, column 4, while almost
half of the studies (n = 13) [5,30,32,38-40,42,46-50,52]
were multi-perspectival with involvement of profes-sionals and service users, 12 of the remaining studies
[15,18,29,31,33-36, 41,43-45] focused on the perspectives
of healthcare professionals only. However, it is evident thatwithin the latter studies, different perspectives were often
sought from within the healthcare profession ( i.e.,G P s ,
nurses, allied health professionals, senior management).
It is interesting to note that Gallacher et al. ’s study
[19] is the only one to focus solely on the patient ’s per-
spective. While not multi-perspectival, it does reinforcethe message that the implementation of complex health
interventions owes as much to the work of patients as it
does to service providers and other personnel in healthand social care agencies [31].
What are the reported benefits, if any, of using NPT?
The majority of papers reviewed [5,15,18,19,28,30,34,35,
37-40,43,45-47,49-52] provided data about their experi-
ences of using NPT, and the various challenges and ben-efits in using it.
MacFarlane and O ’Reilly-de Brún [40] reflected on the
challenge, for example, of overcoming tensions aroundusing a predetermined conceptual framework and not
wishing to ‘force data into predetermined codes or cat-
egories. ’They also described their concerns about un-
derstanding the constructs and ‘getting it right, ’stating
that ‘it was sometimes difficult to know exactly what CI
was about in this specific setting, and how it differedfrom SSW, and so on. ’The concern was that if the au-
thors misunderstood the intended conceptual meaning
of the constructs, their analysis would not be congruentwith the NPM, and this would reduce the benefits of
using the theory in the first place. Atkins et al. [38] and
Franx et al. [35] shared similar views in that the appli-
cation of the NPT constructs was problematic due to
the aforementioned overlap an d difficulty of discerning
the differences between the constructs. Gunn et al. [45]
remarked on the efforts required in developing each of the
constructs within the complexity of current organizational
practice.McEvoy et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:2 Page 5 of 13

that did consisted of emotional work. Mair et al. [50]
reflected on ‘attitudes ’and comment that this particular
theme did not map onto the constructs of NPM. How-ever, they acknowledged that unlike other theories such
as the Theory of Planned Behavior, NPM relates to the
work being done in interactions rather than focusing onhow attitudes or intentions will affect work.
Overall, there was strong endorsement from researchers
for the theory across a range of disciplines. Of the 20papers that provided data about their experiences of
using NPT, 15 [5,18,19,28,35,37-39,43,46,47,49-52] com-
mented that NPT was beneficial because it provided anexplanatory theoretical framework for helping to identify
factors that promote and inhibit implementation of com-
plex interventions:
‘Our findings suggest that NPT provides a useful
framework for understanding the processes that affectthe implementation, embedding, and integration of
new technologies into healthcare systems ’[18].
‘The findings suggest that NPT is a theoretical
framework that facilitates understanding of
experiences of health care work at the individual, aswell as the organizational, level ’[19].
It was also emphasized that NPT had assisted in making
clear recommendations for future implementation (n = 11)
[5,18,28,35,38,39,45-47,49,51]:
‘The model also assists in making clear
recommendations for future implementation. This
was important as this program was a pilot with a viewto inform service decisions on whether and how to
scale up the program across the province. We
anticipated that the model could provide insightsregarding the factors that would lead to normalization
of the program ’[38].
Finally, some authors discussed the positive impact of
NPT on trial design and development of an intervention
(n = 3) [5,46,52], for example:
‘The NPM provides a useful structure for both guiding
and analysing the process by which an intervention is
optimized for testing in a larger scale trial or for
subsequent wide-scale implementation ’[46].
At the same time, authors suggest further development
of NPT [15,18,38,50] relating to: the determination of itsvalue to guide the development of interventions for use
in routine healthcare [18]; the need for study-specific
measure/application of NPT [15]; the development oftools and methods to assist in the use of the NPM [38];its potential to be used as a tool to assess the likelihood
of future normalization of a complex intervention [50].
Discussion
Across the 29 NPT papers included in this review, most
of which were from the UK, there is evidence of a growing
interest in the application of the NPT beyond its original
field of e-health and telehealth. It is mainly being usedto qualitatively analyze the implementation of complex
interventions in a diverse range of healthcare settings.
Our analysis of the application of the NPT constructs
across settings indicates that, overall, authors attributed
meanings to each construct that resonated with our un-
derstanding of the construct and that had veracity interms of their reported data from their specific study
s e t t i n g .W ed i dh a v es o m eq u e r i e sa b o u ta u t h o r s ’coding
decisions; these related to potential overlaps betweenconstructs, and also the issue of what stage in the imple-
mentation journey data related to. Indeed, some authors
reported challenges of this nature when discussing theiruse of NPT. They described the difficulties experienced in
assigning data, which can often be so closely interrelated,
to a single category within the theory [38].
While it is valuable to note that the NPT constructs
are not in competition with each other but are intended
to work together to explain causal mechanisms, we dorecognize the challenge of such coding decisions, which is
inherent in all qualitative analyses [53]. Our own experi-
ence of NPT coding is that if data are based on planningthe implementation of an intervention they are most likely
to relate to Coherence and Cognitive Participation, and
if they are based on actual experiences of enacting anew intervention they are most likely to relate to Col-
lective Action and Reflexive Monitoring. At the same
time, NPT has been developed with attention to thed y n a m i cn a t u r eo fi m p l e m e n t a t i o nw o r k( e.g.,s e n s e
making may be influenced by enactment). Therefore,
we also acknowledge that the fluidity and flexibilityinherent in NPT is important to take into account dur-
ing coding, based on the specific context of each piece
of data.
Overall, there was strong endorsement from several
authors that it was beneficial to use NPT as a concep-
tual framework to analyze implementation processes
and inform recommendations to guide implementation
work [5,40]. This is an extremely important finding,suggesting that NPT is a new theory that does provide a
generalizable framework that can be applied across con-
texts, with opportunities for incremental knowledgegain over time and an explicit framework for analysis
that can explain and potentially shape implementation
journeys. This finding about the benefit of using NPT issimilar to Helfrich et al. ’s [7] finding about the benefit ofMcEvoy et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:2 Page 10 of 13
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/9/1/2
using the ‘Promoting Action on Research Implementation
in Health Services ’framework, and thus we can see an
expanding evidence base about the use of theory in studiesabout translational gaps.
A number of authors reported that some of their find-
ings were outside the NPT conceptual framework. Thisis not a problem per se b e c a u s et h eN P T ,l i k ea n y
middle-range theory, cannot and does not claim to be a
theory of everything. This finding indicates that authorsare thinking critically about the relevance of NPT con-
structs to their data and are using it as a heuristic device
rather than as a ‘conceptual straitjacket. ’Such critical
and flexible use of NPT is recommended by its developers
[31] and advocates of using theory in social science
research more generally [54].
In terms of recommendations for future use of NPT,
we note that authors rarely explained why they had
selected NPT as opposed to other theories and rarelycontrasted findings to previous studies. This may in
part be a function of the current development of the
implementation science literature, and the natural evolu-tion of standards and expectations about what details
researchers most need to repo rt [7]. However, for future
use it would be valuable to have this detail in the write-upof NPT or any theory. We therefore recommend that au-
thors explicate their rationale for choosing NPT as their
theoretical framework, particularly given that implementa-tion science, like other closely related fields ( e.g.,h e a l t h
services research, health technology assessment, and
improvement science), needs comprehensive, robust,and rigorous theories that e xplain the social processes
that lead from inception to practice [55]. In detailing
their use of theory, authors will be making a contribu-tion to implementation theory.
Also, even though NPT has highlighted the need to
provide a whole-system analysis, many papers in thisreview only included single-stakeholder perspectives and
there was an emphasis on service providers rather than
service users. The limitations of such an approach toinform implementation processes should be considered
during the analysis process [31] and acknowledged by
researchers as they develop recommendations for future
research or practice.
Finally, to fully explore the scope of NPT to shape im-
plementation journeys, we need more studies that use the
theory in a prospective manner. In this review there was
only one such study [38], but others are underway andwill provide valuable findings in the future [6]. As sug-
gested by Grol et al. [56] and Murray et al. [10], there is
scope for NPT to be used during the planning stages ofimplementation projects to explore the real-world con-
text in which the work will take place. Such approaches
may provide important data to re-direct or stop plan-ning if the likelihood of normalization is low.Limitations
First, this review did not include non-English languagepapers and therefore we cannot comment on the useand perceived value of NPT in non-English speaking
settings. However, it would be valuable to do so in
future reviews and to explore its use and stability acrosscultural settings, given that our search identified a number
of foreign language papers using NPT from countries
such as Sweden and Italy and the use of NPT in threeEuropean-wide research projects: REsearch into imple-
mentation STrategies to support patients of different
ORigins (RESTORE) [6], Self-care Support for Peoplewith Long Term Conditions, Diabetes and Heart Dis-
ease: A Whole System Approach (EU-Wise) [57], and
INnovative, Midlife INterve ntion for Dementia Deter-
rence (In-MINDD) [58].
Second, reviews are one step removed from the primary
data, and therefore we rely on the authors ’reports of ben-
efits and limitations of NPT usage, which could be limited
or sanitized versions of their experience. No attempts were
made to contact authors for additional information.
In terms of gaps in the information provided by the
studies, we noted that in the quality appraisal process
the lowest scoring domain tended to be in terms of ethicsand bias, primarily because there was very limited dis-
cussion of either of these issues within the papers. As
an example, while authors reported whether they hadethical approval or not, they did not elaborate on ethical
issues in the research process. This limited reporting
about ethics and bias is likely to be a function of theword count restrictions in journal articles.
To enhance quality and rigor, we took several steps to
increase the transparency and reliability of our review.First, given that some of the authors (LB, COD, FSM
and AMacF) have been involved in the development of
NPT, we decided at the outset of the review that wewould focus on explicit accounts of NPT in use and
explicit reflections by authors on its merits/demerits ( i.e.,
to allow the authors of the NPT papers to speak forthemselves as much as possible). We favored this ap-
proach on the basis that it would heighten the authenti-
city of our conclusions given our involvement in the
development of NPT. Second, all steps of the review
were led by the lead author who has had no prior involve-ment in the development of the theory. Third, during the
coding process we employed double independent coding
during indexing and carting of the data, and discussionswith all authors to reach consensus during the mapping
and interpretation phases. These three steps heightened
our critical thinking during the analysis process and theauthenticity of our conclusions.
As this was a qualitative review of predominantly quali-
tative empirical studies, some aspects of the PRISMA [59]statement were not applicable (see Additional file 4).McEvoy et al. Implementation Science 2014, 9:2 Page 11 of 13

Conclusions
In conclusion, NPT has served as a useful and benefi-
cial conceptual heuristic for many researchers andpractitioners from different communities in terms of
framing and enhancing analysis of implementation pro-
cesses and informing recommendations for improvingimplementation.
NPT has potential to help understand the translational
gap, providing us with a generalizable framework thatcan apply across differing settings and individuals, the
opportunity for incremental accumulation of knowledge,
and an explicit framework for analysis. Whether NPT canserve as a tool to shape implementation processes in ways
that will promote integration and embedding of complex
interventions remains unclear and merits investigation.
