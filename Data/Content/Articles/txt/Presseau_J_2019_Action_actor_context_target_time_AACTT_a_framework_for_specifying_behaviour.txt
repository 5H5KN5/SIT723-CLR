Abstract
Background: Designing implementation interventions to change the behaviour of healthcare providers and other
professionals in the health system requires detailed specification of the behaviour(s) targeted for change to ensure
alignment between intervention components and measured outcomes. Detailed behaviour specification can help
to clarify evidence-practice gaps, clarify who needs to do what differently, identify modifiable barriers and enablers,
design interventions to address these and ultimately provides an indicator of what to measure to evaluate an
intervention ’s effect on behaviour change. An existing behaviour specification framework proposes four domains
(Target, Action, Context, Time; TACT), but insufficiently clarifies who is performing the behaviour (i.e. the Actor).
Specifying the Actor is especially important in healthcare settings characterised by multiple behaviours performed
by multiple different people. We propose and describe an extension and re-ordering of TACT to enhance its utility
to implementation intervention designers, practitioners and trialists: the Action, Actor, Context, Target, Time (AACTT)
framework. We aim to demonstrate its application across key steps of implementation research and to provide tools
for its use in practice to clarify the behaviours of stakeholders across multiple levels of the healthcare system.
Methods and results: We used French et al. ’s four-step implementation process model to describe the potential
applications of the AACTT framework for (a) clarifying who needs to do what differently, (b) identifying barriers and
enablers, (c) selecting fit-for-purpose intervention strategies and components and (d) evaluating implementation
interventions.
Conclusions: Describing and detailing behaviour using the AACTT framework may help to enhance measurement
of theoretical constructs, inform development of topic guides and questionnaires, enhance the design of
implementation interventions and clarify outcome measurement for evaluating implementation interventions.

Background
Innovations in health research have the potential to im-
prove health but harnessing this potential requires that
effective innovations be translated into routine health-
care. Unfortunately, evidence-practice gaps continue to
be documented: medicines are inappropriately pre-
scribed [ 1], patient safety practices are not enacted [ 2]
and harmful practices persist [ 3]. Sub-optimal clinical
practices (over, under and misuse of tests/treatments)
result in avoidable morbidity and mortality [ 4]. Such
gaps in care are consistent across countries and clinical
areas, leading some to suggest that health research is ‘all
breakthrough, no follow through ’[5]. Implementation
science emerged in response to this, focusing on the
rigorous scientific study and development of a cumula-
tive evidence-base for how best to address evidence-
practice gaps. A foundational requirement of implemen-
tation is the need for someone (usually more than one
person or group), somewhere (from organisational lead-
ership through to those providing direct patient care)
doing something (usually more than one thing) differ-
ently . In short, taking up new evidence requires health-
care providers and other health system stakeholders to
change their behaviour.
Given the centrality of behaviour in implementation
science, there is a need for describing behaviour as
clearly as possible. Doing so may help to (a) clarify
evidence-practice gaps, (b) clarify the various people and
groups at different levels that need to do something dif-
ferently, (c) identify modifiable barriers and enablers and
design implementation interventions to address them,
(d) provide an indicator of what to measure to evaluatean intervention ’s effect and (e) ultimately facilitate evi-
dence synthesis. A generalisable framework may help to
ensure consistency in the description and specification
of behaviour in implementation research.
In the mid-twentieth century, after social psychologists
identified that scores on attitude measures were not as-
sociated with actual behaviour [ 6], Fishbein [ 7] proposed
that the low predictive validity of attitude measures
could be addressed by assessing attitude to an action
(e.g. voting for a specific political party) rather than
assessing attitude to the target of that action (e.g. the
political party). While now taken for granted, this focus
on the action led to a paradigm shift in attitude-
behaviour research and was a key principle underlying
the Theory of Reasoned Action. Extending the approach,
Ajzen [ 8] proposed the Theory of Planned Behaviour for
predicting and explaining human behaviour in a specific
context at a specific time. Together, these ideas gave rise
to the specification of behaviour according to what be-
came known as TACT: Target, Action, Context, Time
[9]. Similarly, Michie and Johnston [ 10] proposed that
when behaviours are described in terms of what, who,
when, where and how, they are more actionable and
hence more likely to be performed.
Clear specification of the behaviour is a key though often
overlooked first step in conducting implementation re-
search for a range of study objectives, such as identifying
influences (barriers and enablers, and determinants) on
behaviour or designing implementation interventions to
support behaviour change among stakeholders in the
health system. Despite half a century of guidance on behav-
iour specification, research is frequently published in which
the behaviour is poorly specified. A systematic review of 67
reports of behaviour change interventions found that the
Action domain was clearly specified in 69% of reports, and
that all components of the TACT framework were
described in only 5 (7.5%) reports [ 11]. Poor specification
makes it difficult to measure behaviour and behaviour
change. Clear specification facil itates strong compatibility
between the behaviour under investigation and the theore-
tical constructs that predict that behaviour, which enhances
prediction (cf. the principle of compatibility) [ 12,13].
Consider the following description of a potential
guideline-recommended clinical behaviour for primary
care practitioners: ‘For people with diabetes, record a
blood pressure reading in the patient ’s medical records ’
(Example 1). Using the TACT framework to unpack this
recommendation, the two specified components are the
Target (people with diabetes) and the Action (record a
blood pressure reading in the patient ’s medical record).
While a seemingly straightforward description, it is not
clear who should do the behaviour and when and where
it should take place. Leaving this implicit introduces am-
biguity that may undermine change efforts as well asContributions to the literature
/C15Behaviour change is a fundamental outcome of interest in
implementation science and underpins change at multiple
health care levels, but behaviour is often not clearly specified

measurement of whether or not the behaviour has been
performed.
Drawing upon Fishbein and Ajzen ’s[9] early advice, a
clearer, more actionable specification could be: ‘For
people with diabetes ( Target ), record a blood pressure
reading in the patient ’s medical records ( Action ) in the
primary care clinic ( Context ) when they attend for their
annual diabetes review ( Time )’(Example 2). Example 2
specifies further components of the behaviour: Time
(when patients attend) and Context (primary care clinic).
This enhanced specification corresponds to the TACT
framework, but still lacks a fundamental component:
who (i.e. which person or people on the primary care
team) is responsible for performing the Action. Further-
more, Example 2 arguably involves a sequence of
discrete Actions (taking the blood pressure reading,
accessing the patient ’s medical records, entering the
blood pressure reading into the record). It may also in-
clude ancillary behaviours such as inviting the patient to
attend the clinic for the annual review. These actions
may be performed by different primary care staff (e.g.
physician, nurse, administrator) to support the focal be-
haviour of interest. This dimension of specification is
not included in the TACT framework, which assumes
that the individual is performing the behaviour for them-
selves. In implementation research, individuals often
perform a behaviour for someone else ’s benefit (i.e. the
Target, such as a patient). We propose to expand the
TACT framework to guide specification of behaviour in
terms of not only Target, Action, Context and Time but
also Actor —the person(s) who will perform the Ac-
tion(s). By clarifying the Actor, the Action then becomes
clearer and more specific, allowing for clarification of
complex behaviours (or sequences of behaviour) in
terms of different Actions performed by different Actors
in the health care setting at different times (i.e. prepara-
tory and sequential Actions).
AACTT: an expanded framework for specifying behaviour
We propose the AACTT framework (Action, Actor,
Context, Target, Time) for specifying behaviour. Re-
arranging the order of domains in the framework reflects
a more easily defined sequence for specifying behaviour
than TACT that naturally begins with the Action and
who performs it.
Although it may sometimes seem obvious who is to
perform the Action, for behaviours that are performed
by healthcare professionals or teams for, with or on be-
half of their patients, specification of the Actor is par-
ticularly helpful. Indeed, healthcare delivery behaviours
have been described as ‘collective behaviours ’, suggesting
that role confusion may be a barrier to performance [ 14]
that could be illuminated by careful specification of the
behaviour at the outset using AACTT.While Action and Actor are important, specification of
Context and Time allows the responder to keep these
elements in mind when answering a questionnaire,
responding in an interview or changing their behaviour.
Behaviours are inherently tied to the time and place in
which they occur, and thus clarification of these ele-
ments provides an opportunity to situate analyses of bar-
riers and enablers and intervention design within the
contexts that behaviours take place. Recent theoretical
advances emphasise the role of associative processes in
behaviour [ 15], including automatic processes [ 16–19].
Specification of contextual and temporal cues in ques-
tionnaire items, interview topic guides and observational
tools may increase the validity of responses, especially if
the behaviour has an element of automaticity. Context
and time may also be important for identifying when
and where it is appropriate to perform an Action, thus
informing implementation efforts.
When considering the behaviour of individuals and
teams as they deliver health care, a further refinement of
the‘Target ’domain is appropriate. ‘Target ’is often ex-
plained as (performing) an Action tosomeone, i.e. who
the behaviour is targeted at. However, current models of
healthcare delivery place a focus on patients as active
participants in their health care, and thus as a collabor-
ator with the healthcare professional. Hence, rather than
performing an Action toa passive recipient, the health-
care professional may act with orforthe patient. Thus, it
is recommended that researchers frame (i) Action and
(ii) Target as (i) doing what? (ii) to,for,with oron behalf
ofwhom?
In doing so, the Actor-Target relationship need not
only reflect a healthcare professional-patient relation-
ship. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, for healthcare profes-
sionals working in a team, one healthcare professional ’s
(Actor A) behaviour (Action A) may be for the benefit
of another healthcare professional (Target A), enabling
the latter ’s subsequent behaviour (Action B). Such hori-
zontal sequences within teams also apply to specifying
the behaviour of vertical sequences of behaviour within
the health system, where a policymaker ’s (Actor A) be-
haviour (Action A) sets the stage for a healthcare ad-
ministrator (Target A/Actor B) to perform a behaviour
within their role (Action B) that benefits the healthcare
professional (Target B/Actor C) and enables them to
provide care (Behaviour C) to benefit their patients
(Target C). Thus, a given Actor ’s Target can also be
another Actor in the system.
AACTT provides common elements that can be used
for consistent description and specification of behaviour.
By extension, AACTT can be used to describe the
sequence of multiple behaviours of multiple Actors at
different levels of the organisation required to enact
change. For instance, in the case of promoting handPresseau et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:102 Page 3 of 13
hygiene in hospital, AACTT provides a means for clari-
fying the behaviour of those engaging in hand sanitizing
behaviour, but also the leadership in the organisation
whose policy-enacting behaviour sets the stage for mid-
dle management to engage in procurement behaviour to
provide hand sanitizing stations and gels, through to
maintenance staff engaging in refilling behaviour to
ensure sanitizing gel is available for the healthcare
providers. Each behaviour by these organisational Actors
is required for healthcare providers to engage in hand-
sanitizing activities. Rather than making implicit as-
sumptions about such a sequence of behaviours or
describing them as separate organisational factors, the
AACTT framework helps to unpack the complexity and
clarify the responsibility of all behaviours in organisa-
tional health settings, providing a clear opportunity for
behavioural approaches to inform organisational change.
The level of granularity or aggregation in the specifica-
tion of each AACTT domain should be defined by what
is measurable, useful and practical for the given applica-
tion, to ensure practical utility.
In summary, we propose a new framework: AACTT
(Action, Actor, Context, Target, Time —see Table 1for
definitions and examples) to allow for the careful delin-
eation of ‘who does what; to, for or with whom; when;
where? ’[10]. Herein, our aim is to demonstrate how the
AACTT framework can be used within the main steps
of an implementation research process and to provide a
simple tool that implementation researchers and practi-
tioners can use to apply the AACTT framework to
specify the behaviour(s) of stakeholders.
Methods
We used French ’s four-step implementation process model
[20] to exemplify how AACTT can be applied to each of
the key steps of the implementation process: Step 1 (clarify-
i n gw h on e e d st od ow h a td i f f e rently), Step 2 (using a the-
oretical framework, which barriers and enablers need to be
addressed), Step 3 (which intervention components couldovercome the modifiable barriers and enhance the enablers)
and Step 4 (how can behaviour change be measured and
understood). We selected French ’s process model to guide
the demonstration of AACTT ’s application given that its
foundational step involves clarifying the behaviour.

tions [ 22] and process evaluations [ 23]). At each step, we
identified how the AACTT framework could be applied
and provide published examples across a range of
methodological approaches which align with those
commonly used in implementation research [ 24].
Results
Step 1 —Using AACTT to identify who needs to do what,
differently, when and where
The AACTT framework can be used at this foundational
step of implementation research to ensure coverage across
key behaviours (Actions), stake holders (Actors, Targets) in
the particular settings (Time , Context) of desired perform-
ance. This helps ensure that subsequent steps remain con-
sistent with the AACTT-specifi ed behaviour(s) established
at the outset. Application of the AACTT framework at this
step can help to identify which individuals at which levels
of an organisational hierarchy need to do something differ-
ently to implement an evidence-based practice (or indeed
de-implement an outdated or non-evidenced practice).
Actors often include healthcare professionals, but may also
involve their colleagues within a team, administrative staff
and middle and upper management whose own Actions fa-
cilitate the clinical behaviour of the health professional, and
ultimately patients and citiz ens behaviour. One can extend
Actors to people at multiple levels in a healthcare system,
e.g. organisational leadership , policy makers and political
Actors, whose own behaviours may be centrally important
to ensuring that the health p rofessional can engage in a
given guideline-recommended behaviour under investiga-
tion. The AACTT framework can be employed to unpackTable 1 AACTT framework definitions and examples

complex organisational and hier archical inter-relationships
into the multiple observable, measurable (and changeable)
Actions of individuals at each level. This can provide the
basis for clarifying whose beh aviour to focus on in a given
investigation. Figures 1,2and3provide generalisable work-
sheets with a worked example that can be used by imple-
mentation researchers and practitioners, on their own or as
part of a stakeholder engagement activity, to clarify who
needs to do what, differently (see also Additional file 1for
blank versions of each worksheet).
The implication of identifying who needs to do what
differently also suggests a need to clarify a gap in care.In specifying behaviour using the AACTT framework, it
may become clearer where specifically evidence-practice
gaps exist (i.e. specifically whose behaviour in what
settings and time) rather than broader generalisations of
evidence of gaps in care typically available to justify a
focused implementation diagnostic effort.
Step 2 —Using the AACTT framework to inform
investigations to identify barriers and enablers
Having an AACTT-specified behaviour(s) can inform
more focused investigations into the barriers and drivers
of Actions for each Actor. A key benefit to specifying
Fig. 1 AACTT specification tool for a single Action, with worked example applied to improving hand hygienePresseau et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:102 Page 5 of 13
the Actor using this framework is that it helps to iden-
tify which specific agents one should engage with in
eliciting their barriers and enablers to performing the
Action; focusing consideration down specifically on
those who are or could perform the Action. This may
help in qualitative and quantitative approaches to in-
vestigating barriers and enab lers, including interviews/
focus groups to generate qualitative data and
questionnaire-based quantit ative data operationalizing
theoretical constructs hypothesised to correlate with
implementation behaviour. At the initial stages of
inquiry, it may not yet be clear who all these potential
Actors and Actions are but AACTT specification al-
lows this to be further clarified and be made explicit.
Initial broad specification at a higher level (e.g. primary
care staff including nurses and physicians) may help to
recognise the potential for multiple Actors to under-
take the same Action, and to explore during the barrier
elicitation whether this diffusion of responsibility is
problematic (and thus may benefit from greaterspecification for each Actor to promote role clarity) or
acceptable/desirable (in which case a given setting may
find it useful to allocate clear responsibility).
Interviews/focus groups An AACTT-specified behav-
iour provides greater focus to an interview or focus
group to maximise the likelihood that responses are
reflective of the specific Actions of the Actors situated in
a time and place, which may also help with recall. Speci-
fying the Actor up front helps to inform recruitment so
that the respondents are those actually tasked with the
Action (as opposed to others speaking on their behalf).
Topic guides can then be designed to ensure that inter-
view and focus group prompts are consistently focused
on the AACTT-specified behaviours of the respondents
(Actors). For instance, a broadly specified behaviour
such as ‘improving blood pressure prescribing for pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes ’lacks AACTT-specificity and
thus interview/focus group questions aiming to unpack
views on readiness to change [ 25], beliefs about
Fig. 2 AACTT specification for focal and ancillary Actions of multiple Actors, Contexts and Times, with worked example applied to improving
hand hygienePresseau et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:102 Page 6 of 13
consequences and social influences [ 26,27] or imple-
mentation climate and culture [ 28] may remain at a level
that does not clarify how those views translate into un-
derstanding who needs to do what differently and why
they do or do not. In contrast, while ‘increasing the dose
of existing antihypertensive medication (Action) by a
family physician (Actor) during annual diabetes review
(Context) for their patients with type 2 diabetes (Target)
when their blood pressure is above 140/80 mmHg
despite previous management (Time) ’provides an
admittedly longer description, the specificity allows
much greater insight into the factors that may determine
this behaviour than might otherwise be missed by a
broader specification. Describing the AACTT upfront
also allows similar topic guides to be tailored to different
Actors who may be engaging in the same or different
Actions.This is particularly aided when using theoretical
frameworks to inform interview topic guide develop-
ment, such as when using the Theoretical Domains
Framework [ 26,27], COM-B within the Behaviour
Change Wheel [ 29] or Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research [ 28,30,31] to elicit views
about barriers and enablers that are rooted in a given
domain or construct. An AACTT-specified behaviour
can also help a directed content analysis of theory-
informed interviews by providing the capacity to code
barriers and enablers described by respondents directly
linked to a given AACTT-specified behaviour, to ensure
that the barriers identified are in fact related to the
Actions and Actors of interest. Importantly, AACTT-
specification ensures that barriers and enablers are spe-
cifically those linked to a particular Actor and behaviour
in the time and context of performance, rather than

vague and broad barriers/enablers. This facilitates more
targeted intervention development in Step 3.
Questionnaires The original TACT framework was
established to inform the careful development of ques-
tionnaire items to operationalise constructs from the
Theory of Reasoned Action, and then the Theory of
Planned Behaviour that were used to predict behaviour
using cross-sectional and prospective designs. This ap-
proach, known as the principle of compatibility, involves
developing questionnaire items tailored to the specific
Target, Action, Context and Time to ensure consistency
between the items measuring theoretical constructs and
the subsequent behaviour being predicted while ensuring
rigour in operationalisation of the theoretical constructs.
The TACT-informed principle of compatibility was
widely adopted in the 1980s and 1990s when testing of
the Theory of Reasoned Action and Theory of Planned
Behaviour grew in popularity in social and health psy-
chology. At the turn of the century, these social cogni-
tion models began to be adapted and adopted for use in
implementation research to predict the behaviour of
healthcare professionals. Francis and colleagues devel-
oped specific guidance for developing Theory of Planned
Behaviour-based questionnaires for use to understand
and predict health care professional behaviour [ 32]. This
highly cited and influential guidance provided a descrip-
tion of how the TACT framework could be applied in
this setting and influenced subsequent rigorous develop-
ment of Theory of Planned Behaviour questionnaires to
understand how its constructs explain variability in the
behaviour of health care professionals (see Godin et al
2008 for a review [ 33]). Such methods were also then
adopted to operationalise other theories, while to date this
has largely been confined to theories of behaviour [ 34],
there is an opportunity to consider how AACTT-
specification can be integrated into the operationalisation
of questionnaire items for other theories, models and
frameworks used in implementation science and in particu-
lar those for which there is concerted effort to developed
measures such as Consolidat ed Framework for Implemen-
tation Research [ 35], Organizational Readiness for Change
[36] and Normalization Process Theory [ 37]. Huijg and col-
leagues ([ 38], see their Table 5) developed and established
the discriminant content validity of questionnaire items
designed to assess domains from the Theoretical Domains
Framework in such a way to allow any Action, Actor, Con-
text, Target, Time to be integrated into the measure, and
Eccles and colleagues operationalized questionnaires con-
sistent with AACTT for a range of theories of behaviour
([34] see the Additional file 2 in Huijg et al. for examples of
the questionnaire items that they developed). Opportunities
present themselves for similar a daptations for other models,
theories and frameworks.Step 3 —Using AACTT to inform selecting and
operationalizing implementation intervention
components to address barriers and enablers
Best practice in implementation intervention develop-
ment involves selecting evidence-based techniques and
strategies that address the barriers and enablers identi-
fied [ 39], and clarifying who delivers and receives the
intervention, how, when, where and how much [ 40].
Implementation intervention developers have a range of
tools at their disposal for selecting and specifying inter-
ventions: high-level descriptors of implementation stra-
tegies such as those described in Cochrane ’s Effective
Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) [ 41] and Ex-
pert Recommendation for Implementing Change (ERIC)
[42] taxonomies and the Behaviour Change Wheel [ 29],
as well as fine-grained descriptors of techniques such as
those proposed in Behaviour Change Techniques Tax-
onomy [ 43], Intervention Mapping [ 44] or emerging
tools for linking behaviour change techniques to mecha-
nisms of action [ 45]. Regardless of the strategies and
techniques, it can help to know specifically whose
(Actor) behaviour (Action) is being targeted for change
with the strategies/techniques, and where (Context) and
when (Time) the behaviour is expected to be performed,
for/with whom (Target). This may help in narrowing
and prioritizing amongst potential strategies and tech-
niques. By having AACTT-specified behaviours defined,
many of these decisions are made clearer and help to
operationalise the strategies themselves. For instance,
clearly articulated AACTT-specified behaviour can (i)
inform selection of performance indicators provided to
primary care physicians as part of an Audit and Feed-
back (A&F) intervention, (ii) ensure that the A&F inter-
vention is directed to the correct Actors and (iii) that it
reflects the context and times of performance and (iv)
that the data reflect the Target patients.
A multicomponent intervention involving multiple
behaviours and Actors can also be aided by AACTT spe-
cification. For instance in a hospital setting, an interven-
tion to improve hand hygiene may involve the focal
behaviour of sanitizing hands using alcohol-based gel
(Action) performed by nursing staff, surgeons, residents
(Actors), as well as ancillary behaviours such as purchas-
ing hand sanitiser (by administrators) and checking/
refilling dispensers (by cleaning staff) that are necessary
in supporting the focal behaviour. Other settings, such
as primary care, might similarly involve a focal Action of
initiating a new medication or deprescribing another as
well as ancillary Actions, each with respective Actors
(e.g. family doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, adminis-
trative staff, practice managers). Community settings
could also involve other professional groups (e.g. social
workers), parents/carers and teachers. For example, re-
garding implementing dietary menu guidelines in dayPresseau et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:102 Page 8 of 13
care (nursery) services [ 46], the action could be ‘prepar-
ing food consistent with childhood dietary guidelines ’,
the actor could be ‘cooks ’, the context ‘in the day care
centre kitchen ’, the target ‘children attending day care ’
and the time ‘at lunch every week day ’. Regardless of the
apparent complexity of the implementation intervention
being developed, the AACTT framework can provide
transparency and clarity in terms of whose behaviour is
targeted by the strategies in the intervention.
Step 4 —Using AACTT to specify how behaviour change
can be measured and understood
The application of the AACTT framework in previous
steps ensures compatibility with the measures used to
assess change in Step 4. Implementation researchers are
often interested in both whether an intervention changes
behaviour (outcome) as well as explaining the (theory-
informed) mechanisms through which change occurs.
Intervention outcome evaluation Irrespective of the
design used to evaluate an implementation intervention,
a measure or indicator of behaviour is often central to
demonstrating change. In some instances, outcome
measurement is embedded within available routinely col-
lected data, such as prescribing, ordering and referring,
or specific process data collected locally or as part of lar-
ger scale initiatives (e.g. Quality and Outcomes Frame-
work in the UK) and national audits. When such data
are accessible, they provide a pragmatic, low-burden
means of evaluating implementation interventions. How-
ever, this often involves having to balance consideration
of pragmatism with those of measurement specificity.
While the likelihood is low that routinely collected data
perfectly correspond with the Action performed by the
targeted Actor in the Context and Time for the Target
designed for the intervention, having an AACTT-
specification allows clarity of the degree (or not) of this
correspondence. While it is true that in randomised de-
signs, any additional ‘noise ’introduced by pragmatic
outcome measures would at least be balanced by the
randomisation, the more ‘noise ’(i.e. error variance) the
less power to detect change in the actual outcome of
interest, which has implication for sample size calcula-
tions. Thus, even in randomised designs, AACTT-
specification provides an opportunity to establish the
degree of correspondence between the targeted behav-
iour(s) and the indicators of behaviour available to assess
the degree of noise (error) in the outcome.
In evaluations where no routinely collected data are
available, outcome measures are sometimes developed
for the intervention evaluation itself. In such instances,
the added advantage of AACTT specification is that it
can directly guide which data to collect and provides full
control over what ‘counts ’as performance both in termsof the behaviour of interest as well as ancillary be-
haviours that necessarily support the behaviour of interest
but in themselves are not sufficient.
Intervention process evaluation In addition to evaluat-
ing whether an implementation intervention is effective,
it is important to understand the mechanisms through
which this effect occurred both in terms of changing the
targeted mediating constructs (mechanisms of change)
and assessing delivery and receipt as designed (fidelity).
AACTT-specified behaviours provide the same advan-
tage as in Step 2 for informing the design of qualitative
or quantitative assessment of mechanisms of change
alongside outcome assessment, such as in theory-based
process evaluations [ 47–49]. Using AACTT to inform
the wording of process measures that operationalise the
theoretical constructs targeted for change provides mea-
sures of mediators tied directly to the behaviour the
intervention is targeting for change. This provides more
direct correspondence between mechanism and out-
comes. In this instance, AACTT-specification provides
greater measurement sensitivity.
AACTT-specification also allows for more careful as-
sessment of fidelity (and adaptation) of delivery and re-
ceipt of an implementation intervention by providing
structure and transparency in terms of who should re-
ceive the intervention (Actor) and which Action(s) under
which circumstances (Time, Context) for which Targets.
This specificity and transparency can clarify what and
whom to track to assess fidelity and adaptation. Table 2
provides worked examples of AACTT specifications
across study designs.
Discussion
Herein, we introduced the AACTT framework that can
be used to inform the careful specification of behaviour
for implementation research and practice and provided a
generalisable worksheet to facilitate use of the frame-
work (worked examples in Figs. 1,2and3, blank work-
sheets in Additional file 1). AACTT can be applied
across key steps of implementation research and practice
advocated by process models [ 20–22] to transparently
define and measure behaviour(s) in terms of who per-
forms them, for/with whom, when and where. AACTT
formalises a natural progression of the TACT framework
developed by Fishbein and popularised in social and
health psychology for more direct application to behav-
iour where the individual is performing a behaviour for
someone else ’s (i.e. Target) benefit. This has direct appli-
cation not only in implementation science applied to
healthcare settings but also public health –, social
welfare –and family-based settings in which someone
performs an Action for someone else (e.g. school- and
family-focused interventions) [ 46,50].Presseau et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:102 Page 9 of 13

Using the Theory Comparison and Selection Tool (T-
CaST) and checklist [ 51], the AACTT framework is de-
signed to be usable (includes relevant domains, has been
developed so that key stakeholders can use it, we provide
steps for its application and methods for promoting its
application across a range of possible studies and an ex-
planation for how the domains influence each other),
testable/valid (can form the basis for testable hypoth-
eses, includes face-valid explanations and has been used
in empirical studies), applicable (focuses on a key imple-
mentation outcome, can be applied across a range of
methods and across a range of analytical levels, popula-
tions and conditions and is generalisable across disci-
plines) and is likely to be acceptable (to key stakeholders,
and is the historical evolution of a framework rooted in a
particular discipline). Thus, in principle it fulfils all the
criteria for use of a framework by implementation science
researchers and practitioners, though its actual usability,
testability, applicability and acceptability will ultimately be
determined through application of the tool across a range
of types of implementation research [ 52].
Michie and Johnston made a call for making clinical
practice guidelines more specific by specifying ‘what ’,
‘who’,‘when ’,‘where ’and ‘how’[10]. While sharing some
similarities with AACTT, there are three important
differences that distinguish AACTT and underscore its
potential added utility. First, the ‘who’in Michie and
Johnston ’s recommendations refers to the ‘Actor ’but
does not make any mention of ‘to, for or with whom ’
the action is performed (i.e. the ‘Target ’in AACTT,
which may be a patient, a healthcare team member or
other organisational actor). Second, the ‘where ’is spe-
cific to a physical location, whereas ‘Context ’in AACTT
can refer to a broader set of contexts that include the
physical location but could also include a context that is
internal to the actor (e.g. emotional context of a stressful
versus a calm situation) or the social context (e.g. when
patients ’relatives are present). Third, in proposing
AACTT as an extension to Fishbein and Ajzen ’s TACT
framework, we are deliberate in ensuring cumulative
theory and methods development as it extends to
applications within implementation science.
Existing calls for better specification and reporting
have focused on the description and labelling of imple-
mentation intervention strategies (e.g. with taxonomies
of change strategies such as the ERIC [ 42] and BCT [ 43]
taxonomies) and on the wider components of interven-
tions (e.g. with checklists such as TIDIER [ 40]). Within
implementation science, Proctor, Powell and McMillen
[53] proposed seven domains for specifying implementa-
tion strategies per se, including who delivers the strategy
(actors), how they deliver the strategy (actions), what
and to whom the strategy is directed (action target), the
sequence of strategy delivery (temporality), intensity(dose), implementation outcomes affected and justifica-
tion. While some of the Proctor et al. domains share
similar or overlapping nomenclature with AACTT (i.e.
Actor, Action, Time), the scope of intended application
of each framework and its domains differs. As exempli-
fied in Table 1, in the AACTT framework ‘Actor ’refers
to the individuals or groups performing the behaviour
that could be the recipient of an implementation strat-
egy, the ‘Action ’refers specifically to the behaviour being
performed by the Actor and is the object of change and
‘Time ’refers to when that behaviour is performed. Thus,
whereas the seven dimensions proposed by Proctor et al.
focus on detailing the delivery of an implementation strat-
egywithin an implementation intervention, AACTT do-
mains focus uniquely on detailing behaviour(s) .T h u s ,i n
the context of an implementation intervention that would
be specified with Proctor et al. ’s dimensions, the behaviour
specified using AACTT would be an outcome that the
(now well-specified) implementation strategy aims to
change. Thus, AACTT is designed for specifying be-
haviour as the object of change, rather than specifying
implementation strategies designed to bring about
that change.
Conclusion
The careful description of outcomes and measures is of
central importance to the development of a cumulative
and generalisable science. The AACTT framework pro-
vides a means for establishing the core elements of
behaviour targeted for change. The framework can be
applied to describe the behaviour of Actors at multiple
organisational levels. The framework facilitates the sys-
tematic description of who needs to do what differently,
understanding what may stop or help them from doing
so, how to support them to address barriers to change
and how to demonstrate that such support worked.
AACTT is compatible with any theory, model or frame-
work in which behaviour is the focus of inquiry and thus
has the potential to be integrated alongside key theoretical
approaches used in the field. Given on-going efforts to
systematise the measurement of theoretical constructs
[54], and description of intervention components [ 41–43],
there is a need for ensuring that the object of change, i.e.
behaviour, is equally as carefully described and under-
stood. This will ultimately contribute to a greater capacity
to synthesise research over time.
