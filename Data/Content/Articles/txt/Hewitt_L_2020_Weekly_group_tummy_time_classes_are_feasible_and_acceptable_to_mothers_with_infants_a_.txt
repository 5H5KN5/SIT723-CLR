Abstract
Background: The World Health Organization recommends 30 min of tummy time daily for improved motor
development and reduced likelihood of plagiocephaly. As only 30% of infants meet this recommendation, parents
require strategies and support to increase this proportion.
Methods: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a group
intervention to promote tummy time. The design is a cluster randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation,
assessor blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis. Five groups of healthy infants ( N= 35, baseline mean (SD) age 5.9
(2.8) weeks) and their mothers attending local mother ’s groups (Australia) were randomly allocated to the
intervention or control group. The intervention group received group tummy time classes in addition to usual care.
The control group received usual care with their child and family health nurse. Primary outcomes were intervention
feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes were tummy time duration (accelerometry), adherence to physical
activity guidelines, head shape, and motor development. Measures were taken at baseline, post-intervention, and
when infants were 6 months of age. Analyses were by linear mixed models and Cohen ’sdstatistic.
Results: Recruitment, retention, and collection of objective data met feasibility targets. Acce ptability was also met with
intervention mothers reporting the infor mation, goal planning, and handouts signi ficantly more useful and relevant than
control group mothers ( p< 0.01). Moderate effect sizes were also found at post-intervention for tummy time duration,
adherence to physical activity guidelines and infant ability in prone and supine favoring the intervention group (intervention
infants had a mean of 30 min and 30% adherence to guideline s (95% CI 0 to 60.6 min) compared to the control infants who
had a mean of 16.6 min and 13% adherence to the guidelines (95% CI 0 to 42.1 min, Cohen ’sd= 0.5). Limitations were the
small sample size, 4-week intervention, limited accele rometer use, and a homogenous sample of participants.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibility?
The feasibility of a practical group exercise (tummy
time) class conducted in mother ’sg r o u p si sc u r r e n t l y
unknown. In addition, the feasibility of objectively
measuring tummy time using an accelerometer in a
real-world setting is also unknown.
/C15What are the key feasibility findings? Thirty-five
mothers (83%) were recruited to this study and there
were two drop outs (94% retention baseline to post-
intervention). The use of GENEActiv to measure
tummy time was acceptable to 80% of mothers overall
(post-intervention, follo w-up); however, 45% (post-
intervention) reported the accelerometer required in-
put throughout the day to keep it positioned correctly.
/C15What are the implications of the feasibility findings for the
design of the main study? The intervention was well
received by the mothers in the mother ’s groups. Mothers
require support and reminders to use the accelerometer
on their baby for more than 2 days. Future trials should
recruit from more than one local health district to obtain
a more diverse sample of participants.
Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends in-
fants are physically active several times a day in a variety
of ways for the greatest health benefits. This includes at
least 30 min in a prone position (tummy time) spread
throughout the day while they are awake and supervised
[1]. Benefits of tummy time include improved motor de-
velopment [ 2] and a reduced likelihood of deformational
plagiocephaly [ 3]. These recommendations also form part
of the 24-h Movement Guidelines for Australia, Canada,
South Africa, and the UK [ 4–7].
Despite the implementation of interventions aimed at
improving infant nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary
behavior [ 8,9], only 30% of parents adhere to these phys-
ical activity (tummy time) recommendations [ 10]. Interven-
tions aimed to increase awareness, translation and
implementation of infant physical activity guidelines are re-
quired to determine which strategies and types of support
given to parents/carers are feasible, acceptable, and effica-
cious. Assisting parents and carers to meet the recom-
mended targets will ensure the achievement of optimal
health and development outcomes for their children.The purpose of this study was to develop, implement,
and test an intervention to det ermine the feasibility, accept-
ability, and potential efficacy of the intervention to promote
tummy time when delivered in a mother ’sg r o u ps e t t i n g .
The research questions for this study were:
1. What is the feasibility of a group intervention to
promote tummy time when delivered in a mother ’s
group setting?
2. What is the acceptability of a group intervention
delivered to mothers to promote tummy time when
delivered in a mother ’s group setting?
3. What is the potential efficacy (tummy time
duration, adherence to infant physical activity
guidelines, head shape, motor development) of a
group intervention to promote tummy time when
delivered in a mother ’s group setting?
Methods
Overview
This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of
group tummy time classes to mothers and their infants
who were attending their local area health service mother ’s
groups. The primary outcome was feasibility and accept-
ability of the intervention. The secondary outcomes were
tummy time duration, adherence to the tummy time
guidelines for infants, the infant ’s head shape, and motor
development. This study complied with the CONsolidated
Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.
The University of Wollongong and Illawarra Shoalhaven
Local Health District Health and Medical Human Research
Ethics Committee approved the study (2017/368). This
trial was prospectively registered in September 2017 with
the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ANZCTR). Written informed consent was obtained by
the infant ’sm o t h e ro nb e h a l fo ft h e m s e l v e sa n dt h ei n f a n t
prior to the commencement of the study. This study design
will be recommended for further investigation if found to
be adequately feasible and acceptable (positive outcomes
for the intervention usefulness and acceptability) to
mothers attending their local area health district mother ’s
groups. Based on previous studies [ 11,12], feasibility will
be assessed against the following: (1) more than 30 partici-
pants to be screened and recruited, (2) 80% of participants
would be retained, and (3) 70% of objectively measured
physical activity (tummy time) would be successfullyHewitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:155 Page 2 of 11
collected at baseline and follow-up. Acceptability will be
assessed against these parameters: (1) 100% of the planned
sessions would be implemented, (2) there would be a mini-
mum 80% attendance and 80% use of WhatsApp® overall,
and (3) more than 80% of the intervention participants
would report the intervention to be acceptable and useful
based on parent survey.
Participants and recruitment
Participants were recruited in groups from an Early
Childhood Health Service in New South Wales (NSW),
Australia (January 2018 to September 2018). Mothers
with infants in the post-natal period (birth to 12 weeks)
are usually placed into groups by the early childhood
health nurse (ECHN) from this health service. Mothers
(and their infants) attending these groups were invited
to participate in the study by the principal researcher.
The inclusion criteria were a mother and her healthy in-
fant who would attend their local mother ’s group weekly
for 4 weeks. Originally, the study was to include first
time mothers only. However, this was too exclusive in a
small group context and consequently all mothers in the
group were invited to participate.
Sample size, group randomization, and blinding
No sample size power calculations were taken as the main
outcome of this study was feasibility [ 13]. However, the
sample size was determined to provide information that
would be sufficient to demonst rate feasibility. The final
sample size is commensurate with many pilot studies in this
area [ 11]. Whole groups of participants were randomized
to intervention or usual care (control) after baseline data
collection. Randomization of t he group to receive the inter-
vention or usual care (control group) was determined by a
computer-generated random numbers program, conducted
by a researcher who was not part of the research team and
was blinded to group allocation and all participant informa-
tion. The infant outcome measurements (baseline, post-
intervention, follow-up) were taken by a member of the
research team who was blinded to the group allocation. To
avoid observer effect (Hawthorne effect), mothers were not
told the accelerometer was specifically measuring the
amount of tummy time. They were only told the acceler-
ometer was measuring the infant ’s physical activity.
Intervention
Bandura ’s Social Cognitive Theory was used to develop an
intervention that considered how personal, behavioral,
and environmental factors influence the amount of
tummy time given to an infant [ 14,15]. The intervention
was integrated into the start of the mother ’sg r o u p ’su s u a l
2-h session with their early childhood nurse. Personal fac-
tors (e.g., importance of tummy time) were addressed by
an educational component in the intervention that aimedto improve the value and benefits of tummy time. Behav-
ioral (e.g., setting aside time) and environmental factors
(e.g., organizing a space and having equipment ready)
were also addressed by demonstrating and discussing
techniques and equipment for achieving tummy time
throughout the day. Small, achievable goals were set each
week to assist mothers with the frequency and duration of
tummy time. Discussions were had the week following to
allow mothers to converse with their peers regarding tips
and strategies they found helpful or to allay any concerns.
Most importantly, tummy time was practiced together at
the mother ’s groups. This gave practical experience with
immediate feedback and encouragement, enabling
mothers to have the confidence to attempt tummy time at
home. The intervention was conducted by a physiotherap-
ist (principal researcher) and was designed to improve
parent self-efficacy (persuasion and experience) and mas-
tery (attention, retention, goal setting, perceived barriers,
practicing together and motivation) (Additional file 1).
A WhatsApp® social media group was also included in
the intervention group to provide an outlet for mothers to
encourage each other regarding strategies they found
helpful during the week regarding their infant ’st u m m y
time. Messaging via WhatsApp® was limited to the 4-week
intervention time only and was not continued after this
time. Standardized messages were sent from the principal
researcher via WhatsApp® three times per week encour-
aging the mothers to practice tummy time with their in-
fant. For example, “Hi Mums! Hope you are having a
lovely day. If you can, try to meet our goal today of 3 ses-
sions of tummy time today. Don ’tf o r g e tt ou s eat i m e r .
Have fun and let me know how you go!
 ”. Standard-
ized replies were also sent after a mother posted a message
about their baby ’s tummy time. For example, “Yay! Well
done [baby name]!
 ”.
The use of text messaging and social media platforms
to enhance healthy behavior is also an emerging field of
research. Positive benefits have been shown for a parent
text messaging intervention aimed to reduce sedentary
behavior in young children (ages 2 to 4 years) [ 13]. The
use of a parent delivered social media messaging system
to influence infant behavior is yet to be investigated.
Usual care
Groups randomized to the control group received usual
care, which was to attend their local area health service
mother ’s group sessions (once per week for four weeks).
During these sessions, topics such as breastfeeding, set-
tling, tummy time, and development for example were
discussed on an ad hoc basis. The sessions were con-
ducted by the Early Childhood Nurse Practitioner from
this health service. A mother in each control group set
up her own social media group for the mothers in herHewitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:155 Page 3 of 11
respective group to enable social interaction and
organization of events as required.
Outcome measures
Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention and
again when the infants were approximately 6 months old
(follow-up).
Primary outcomes
Feasibility and acceptability
The number of mothers recruited to the study, retention
during the study, and the number that consented to using
the GENEActiv to measure their infant ’s physical activity
was used to determine intervention feasibility. Recruit-
ment was measured by the percentage of mothers who
consented to be a part of the study. Retention was deter-
mined by the percentage of mothers who completed post-
intervention measurements. Feasibility of the GENEActiv
to measure physical activity was measured by calculating
the amount of useable data that were collected. Interven-
tion acceptability was measured by the number of sessions
that were implemented, the attendance of the participants
at the mother ’s groups, and the number of mothers who
chose to participate with the WhatsApp® messaging. In
addition, a post-intervention parent questionnaire (useful-
ness and relevance) was given to all intervention and con-
trol groups [13] (Additional file 2).
Secondary outcomes
Tummy time
Tummy time duration (minutes) was measured using
the GENEActiv accelerometer which has been validated
in a previous study [ 16]. All GENEActiv data were in-
cluded in the baseline and post-intervention measure-
ment time points as all mothers reported their infants
were supine sleeping (sleeping on their back). When the
infants were 6 months old, it was reported that 15% were
sleeping prone (sleeping on their tummy, 10% from the
intervention group, 18% from the control group). To ac-
count for this, nighttime and naptime sleep data were
removed for all infants according to the parent question-
naire regarding their infant ’s routine. Parents were asked
to place the GENEActiv on their infants for 3, 24-h pe-
riods over 7 days to measure the amount of tummy time
they received (baseline, post-intervention, follow-up).
The GENEActiv is worn on the right hip secured by an
elastic strap around the waist. The device was initialized
at 30 Hz and data was collected in 1 s epochs as per the
validation study [ 16]. Wear and non-wear time was clas-
sified by using temperature and z-axis cut points [ 17].
Previous tummy time studies have used subjective parent
reports to provide information regarding the amount of
time an infant engages in tummy time. These studies do
not report the validity and reliability of the questionnairesused [ 18]. With the absence of an objective tool for com-
parison, the accuracy of these reports is unknown. The use
of accelerometry has been demonstrated to be effective in
determining child engagement in physical activity in older
age groups [ 19]. This research is now extending to infant
movement with the GENEActiv accelerometer (ActivIn-
sights Ltd, UK) recently validated to determine the time
spent in non-prone or prone positions by an infant as 98%
and 95%, respectively [ 16].
Head shape and motor development
A physiotherapist (who was blinded to group allocation)
with more than 20 years ’experience in pediatric care mea-
sured the infant outcomes (head shape, motor develop-
ment). Head shape was measured using cranial calipers to
calculate the cranial diagonal difference (CDD) to deter-
mine the presence of plagiocephaly and cephalic index
(CI) to determine the presence of brachycephaly [ 20].
Motor development was assessed using the Alberta Infant
Motor Scale (AIMS) [ 21]. The AIMS is designed to assess
gross motor ability in infants from birth through to walk-
ing [ 22]. The scale has four categories: prone, supine, sit-
ting and standing. Categories are divided into abilities
relating to the final achievement of each skill. Each ability
the infant achieves is scored as “observed ”or “not
observed ”(1 point per ability). The reliability and validity
of this scale is reported in previous studies [ 21].
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25 (IBM
Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics were used
to describe the demographic information of those partici-
pating in the study. Feasibility and acceptability were
assessed using percentages and comparing between groups
using Pearson Chi Square. Groups were compared by
tummy time duration, head shape, and motor development
using linear mixed models (adjusted for clustering by
mother). As there was not adequate power to detect statis-
tically significant differences, Cohen ’sdwas calculated to
determine effect sizes. Cohen ’sdvalues of approximately
0.20, 0.50, and ≥0.80 were defined as a small, moderate
and large effect sizes, respectively [ 23]. Intention-to-treat
principles were followed with all participants analyzed in
the group in which they were randomized and irrespective
of whether they finished the intervention. See Table 1for
further information.

Primary outcomes —feasibility and acceptability
Recruitment and retention
Forty-two mothers were asked to partake in the study from
five different mother ’s groups. Thirty-five mothers (83%)consented to participate in the study and were randomized
(by group) to either the intervention ( n=1 6 )o rc o n t r o l
group ( n= 19). There were two intervention groups and
three control groups with an average of seven mother/in-
fant pairs per group (range 6 to 9 mother/infant pairs per
group). Attendance was on average 69% over the four ses-
sions for the intervention group (includes drop outs) and
80% for the control group. Figure 1demonstrates the flow
of participants through the study [ 24] (see Additional file 3
for CONSORT checklist [ 24]) and Table 3has the attend-
ance record of participants in their respective sessions.
There were no significant differences between the drop
outs ( p> 0.05 for all baseline variables for mothers and in-
fants) and the remaining p articipants in the study.
Usefulness and relevance
All mothers in the intervention group reported that the
information and goal planning was extremely or very
useful compared with 61% (information) and 28% (goal
planning) in the control group ( p< 0.01). Similarly,
100% of mothers in the intervention group reported that
the information and goal planning was extremely or very
relevant compared with 82% (information, p< 0.05) and
46% (goal planning, p< 0.01) in the control group.
Ninety-three percent of the intervention group mothers
thought the tummy time group practice was extremely
or very useful (Fig. 2).
Engagement in WhatsApp®
For the intervention group, standardized messages were
sent three times per week (12 messages per intervention
group) from the principal researcher encouraging the
mothers to practice tummy time with their infant. In
addition, there were 65 standardized replies to the 65Table 1 Outcome measure analysis methods

messages sent by mothers about their own baby ’s tummy
time. Approximately 88% of intervention mothers partic-
ipated in WhatsApp® and sent messages to their group.
There were 128 messages (average of 9 messages per
mother) sent that were relevant to tummy time (104 not
relevant). Of the messages that were relevant to tummy
time, 51% of those messages were about their own baby
and 49% were messages of encouragement to another
mother. For the control group, 84% of mothers reported
they participated in a social media group set up by one
of the mothers in their group. All three control groups
chose Facebook as their social media platform to com-
municate with each other for the purpose of social inter-
action. Both the intervention and control groups
reported the social media was relevant to them equally
(p> 0.05); however, the intervention mothers reported
the social media was significantly more useful than the
control group mothers ( p< 0.05) (Fig. 2).Wearing the GENEActiv
Thirty-one mothers (89%), 25 mothers (71%), and 26
mothers (77%) consented to use the accelerometer to meas-
ure their infant ’s physical activity at baseline, post-
intervention, and at follow-up, respectively. Use of the
GENEActiv to measure tummy ti me was feasible, with most
infants wearing the device for approximately two days, with
a range from 0 to 4 days (calculated from GENEActiv data).
One (intervention group), two (one infant each from the
intervention and control groups), and four infants (two each
from the intervention and control groups) had less than 24-
h wear time at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up, re-
spectively. These infants were not excluded from the analysis
due to the already small sample size. Additional analysis (lin-
ear mixed models) revealed this made little difference to the
final outcome. A practicality q uestionnaire was also adminis-
tered at each measurement time point. The outcomes of the
practicality questionnaire are reported in Table 4.Fig. 1 CONSORT flow diagramHewitt et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:155 Page 6 of 11
Secondary outcomes —potential efficacy
Amount of tummy time and adherence to 24-h movement
guidelines
There were no overall differences between the groups re-
garding the amount of tummy time the baby received
(control group 95% CI, 26.9 to 58.5 min; intervention
group 95% CI, 21.9 to 59 min, p=0 . 6 2 3 )f r o mt h el i n e a r
mixed models analysis. However, there was a moderate ef-
fect size favoring the intervention group for both tummy
time duration and percentage adhering to guidelines at
the post-intervention measurement (Cohen ’sd=0 . 5 ) .A t
post-intervention, control babies had a mean of 16.6 min
and 13% adherence to the guidelines (95% CI 0 to 42.1
min), whereas the intervention babies had a mean of 30
min and 30% adherence to guidelines (95% CI 0 to 60.6
min, Cohen ’sd= 0.5). At 6 months of age, a small effect
size was found with 70% of the intervention group meet-
ing the guidelines compared with 56% of the control
group ( d=0 . 3 )( F i g s . 3and4).
Motor development and head shape
There were no differences between groups regarding
motor development (control group 95% CI, 12.3 to 14.7AIMS total points; intervention group 95% CI, 11.5 to
14.4 AIMS total points, p= 0.691). There was a moderate
effect size at post-intervention for the infant ’sa b i l i t yi n
prone ( d= 0.5) and sitting ( d=0 . 7 )f a v o r i n gt h ei n t e r v e n -
tion group (Table 5). There was a significant effect on the
cranial index ( p= 0.012) with post hoc analysis showing
that the cranial index increases for the intervention group
only from baseline (81.8%) to post-intervention (85.7%) ( p
= 0.001). There was also one extreme outlier in the inter-
vention group in regards to cranial index and as such was
removed from the head shape analysis. There were no dif-
ferences between the groups for the plagiocephaly head
shape measure (control group 95% CI, 2.4 to 3.8 mm;
intervention group 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.1 mm, p= 0.314) from
the linear mixed models.
Personal, behavioral, and environmental factors
There were no significant difference between groups at
any measurement time point regarding the mothers re-
ported knowledge about the benefits of tummy time, be-
ing afraid when their infant is on their tummy, tummy
time being important to them, equipment used to assist
their baby ’s tummy time, setting aside time for theirTable 3 Attendance in mother ’s group sessions, n(%)

time usually takes place (all p> 0.05). Despite this, only
the mothers in the intervention group (50%) reported

their baby was receiving.
Discussion
This study investigated the feas ibility, acceptability, and po-
tential efficacy of group tummy time classes to mothers at-
tending their local area health service mother ’sg r o u p s .T h e
content and group tummy time practice was feasible and
acceptable to mothers. In addition, the use of a social media
platform such as WhatsApp® was also useful for the
mothers in this study to improve their compliance to
tummy time recommendations. Using the accelerometer on
infants as a measurement tool was somewhat feasible with
an average wear time of approximately two days at each
measurement time point. The effect of the program on the
potential efficacy were promisi ng at post-intervention with
moderate effect sizes for tummy time duration, percentage
meeting the guidelines, and ability in prone and sitting. The
significant effect found for th e cranial index measure from
baseline to post-intervention w as also an interesting finding;
however, a larger RCT adequately powered to determine
statistically significant di fferences would be required to
make further recommendations re garding this information.Designing a program taking into account many of the
personal, behavioral and environmental factors affecting
behavior change are shown to be more effective [ 25–29].
It is presumed that this is why the intervention was feas-
ible and acceptable for the mothers in this study. The
intervention was personal, included realistic goal setting
and a supportive environment of mothers in the same
stage of life. The effect sizes at 6 months of age were
smaller than expected; this may be due to contact be-
tween mothers and researchers ceasing after the post-
intervention measurements. The addition of a booster
education session or the continuation of WhatsApp®
messaging after the 4-week intervention may have
assisted intervention mothers continue with their tummy
time practices post-intervention [ 13].
Previous studies have also demonstrated an association
between awake prone time and a better attainment of sit-
ting skills [ 30,31]. It is hypothesized that prone position-
ing improves trunk extension and upper limb weight
bearing which are abilities that assist with learning to sit
[31]. As experienced in this study, developing a relation-
ship of trust with the parent is an important element in
changing behavior [ 32]. Communicating directly and
openly with families, health care professionals have oppor-
tunities to address concerns that may serve as barriers toTable 4 Practicality questionnaire —number of parents and percentage of agreement

(ECHN) care for parents and infants in this post-natal
stage, the addition of 24-h Movement Guideline informa-
tion to existing mother ’s groups conducted by ECHN
teams may be an ideal time to begin this education.Tummy time remains a challenging task for parents.
This study is important as it highlights that programs in

play. The use of group tummy time practice and starting
a WhatsApp® group are two strategies that could be con-
sidered by ECHN teams to further support parents
achieve optimal outcomes for their infants.
Translating current evidence to parents and health
care providers about infant physical activity in a real-
world setting and improving the ability to measure in-
fant physical activity using objective measurement tech-
niques are essential to target. Results from this study can
be used to design a larger randomized controlled trial,
refine other existing programs, and prioritize strategies
that will optimize infant care through which positive
health strategies can be started from birth.
Strengths of this study include the implementation of an
intervention that was added to an existing health service
aimed to assist mothers and their infants reach optimum
health outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that starting
early, role modeling, practicing skills, and building social
networks are successful to enhance infant physical activity
[33]. Additional strengths of the study were the use of ob-
jective measurement techniques, and the development of
the intervention using Social Cognitive Theory. Limita-
tions for this study include the small sample size, one area
health service, a 4-week intervention, and limited number
of days using the accelerometer to measure tummy time.
Additionally, many mothers (approximately 45%) reported
the accelerometer required input throughout the day to
keep it positioned correctly. The use of a pouch to contain
the accelerometer in clothing or inserting belt loops to a
“wondersuit ”or onesie may have decreased the burden on
mothers to keep the accelerometer correctly positioned
on the right hip. The groups were homogenous with
mothers being mostly highly educated (> 85% with a uni-
versity degree or higher), Australian, and from middle-
income families. Results therefore from this study may not
be transferrable to parents from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds or from different cultural groups as the in-
formation was presented in English and required the use
of a smart phone and dependent upon mothers attending
their local mother ’s groups for support. Control groups
were also not monitored for the amount of tummy time
education or practice that was discussed with the mothers
in these groups even though it was usual practice for
mother ’s groups in this health district to include this in-
formation (informal ad hoc education). It is recommended
that any future trials using this model of care attempt to
recruit participants from more than one local health dis-
trict to obtain a more diverse sample of participants. In
addition, future trials should ensure GENEActiv place-
ment is secured by belt loops and not dependent upon
mothers to keep it positioned correctly, and obtain a lar-
ger sample size. As parenting groups are usually delivered
by the ECHN, training nurses to implement this program
would also assist with scale-up into the NSW Healthsystem. Lastly, information regarding parent ’s expectations
of the mother ’s groups would be important to consider in
a larger randomized controlled trial to determine their
pre-conceived ideas regarding the level of support or edu-
cation that will be provided. Future trials may consider
further piloting to determine the efficacy of the interven-
tion being delivered by ECHN and the feasibility and ac-
ceptability of recruiting from multiple health districts.
Conclusion
The addition of a group tummy time program was found
to be feasible and acceptable to mothers attending their
local area health service mother ’s groups. WhatsApp®
was also useful for the mothers in this study to improve
their compliance to tummy time recommendations. Po-
tential efficacy on motor development was positive for
immediate effects (prone and sitting); however, overall
effects remain inconclusive. A larger randomized con-
trolled trial is warranted.
Practical implications
/C15A group tummy time program with practical and
social media components are feasible and acceptable
to mothers attending their local area health service
mothers groups.
/C15Providing support to parents in implementing the
24-h Movement Guidelines is needed in the infant
stage of life.
/C15Objective measurement of tummy time by GENE
Activ is feasible in the real-world setting.
