Abstract
Background: Facilitation has been id entified in the literature as a po tentially key component of successful
implementation. It has not, however, ei ther been well-defined or well-studied . Significant questions remain about the
operational definition of facilitation and about the relationship of fa cilitation to other interven tions, especially to other
change agent roles when used in mu lti-faceted implementation projects.
Researchers who are part of the Quality Enhancement Resear ch Initiative (QUERI) are actively exploring various
approaches and processes, including faci litation, to enable implementation of best practices in the Veterans Health
Administration health care system – the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. This paper describes
a systematic, retrospective evaluation of implementation-related facilitati on experiences within QUERI, a quality
improvement program developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs.
Methods: A post-hoc evaluation was conducted through a series of semi-structured interviews to examine the concept
of facilitation across several multi-si te QUERI implementation studies. The in terview process is based on a technique
developed in the field of education, which systematically enha nces learning through experience by stimulating recall and
reflection regarding past complex activiti es. An iterative content analysis approach  relative to a set of conceptually-based
interview questions was us ed for data analysis.
Findings: Findings suggest that facili tation, within an implementation study in itiated by a central change agency, is a
deliberate and valued process of interactive problem solving and support that occurs in the cont ext of a recognized need
for improvement and a supportive inte rpersonal relationship. Facilitati on was described primarily as a distinct role with a
number of potentially crucial behaviors and activities. Data further suggest that exte rnal facilitators we re likely to use or
integrate other implementation interventions, while performing this problem-so lving and supportive role.Published: 18 October 2006

(page number not for citation purposes)Preliminary Conclusions: This evaluation provides evidence to suggest th at facilitation could be  considered a distinct
implementation intervention, just as au dit and feedback, educationa l outreach, or similar meth ods are considered to be
discrete interventions. As such , facilitation should be well-defined and e xplicitly evaluated for its perceived usefulness
within multi-intervention implementa tion projects. Additionally, research ers should better define the specific
contribution of facilitation to the success  of implementation in different types of  projects, different types of sites, and
with evidence and innovations of vary ing levels of strength and complexity.
Background
Implementation of research findings into practice is a
complex undertaking that has often fallen short of expec-
tations. In part, this is due to the current lack of substan-
tive knowledge regarding both individual
implementation interventions and the interrelationship
of multiple interventions used in many studies [1-4].
One type of intervention often used in conjunction with
other implementation interventions is that of a change
agent. A change agent is an "an individual who influences
clients' innovation decisions in a direction deemed desir-
able by a change agency [p.28, [5]]," with change agency
defined as an "organisation or other unit that promotes
and supports adoption and implementation of innova-
tions [p. 372, [6]]." Specific types of change agent roles
typically studied in recent health care implementation
research include opinion leaders, outreach educators, aca-
demic detail workers, and clinical champions.
An additional change agent role posited as key to success-
ful implementation is that of a facilitator [7,8]. The PAR-
IHS framework, developed from relevant literature and
case studies, posits that successful implementation is a
function of three factors: the nature of the evidence, qual-
ity of the context, and facilitation. Facilitation was
recently highlighted within the United States (US) Veter-
ans Health Administration (VHA) as theoretically-promis-
ing to the change agentry role of QUERI. [See Table 1 for
a definition of QUERI and other key terms.] At the conclu-
sion of an initial round of projects, several QUERI imple-
mentation researchers decided to collaboratively,
retrospectively, and systematically explore their facilita-
tion-related experiences to better define the concept and
its potential value.
The PARIHS framework, facilit ation and relevant research
The PARIHS framework, which was the basis for initial use
of facilitation in QUERI, conceives of facilitation as one of
the three factors key to successful implementation [7,8].
The originators of the framework suggest that facilitators
have a key role in helping individuals and teams under-
stand what they need to change and how to change it to
successfully implement evidence into practice [8]. As
such, facilitation can be identified as a potential interven-
tion that enables the implementation of evidence intopractice [9]. However, the precise role of facilitation and
its contribution to the success of implementation, partic-
ularly within multi-site projects across a health system,
has yet to be thoroughly described, operationally defined,
or well-evaluated.
The process of facilitation and the related role of a facili-
tator are evident in a number of different fields and disci-
plines ranging across education, counseling,
management, clinical supervision, and quality improve-
ment. Available evidence reviewed by Harvey and col-
leagues [9], however, illustrates variable interpretations
and approaches to facilitation. For example, in practice-
based learning methods, such as clinical supervision, the
focus is on "facilitating experiential learning through crit-
ical reflection, dealing with psychological defensiveness
and challenging cultural norms [p.580, [9]]." In contrast,
in fields such as quality improvement the purpose of facil-
itation appears to be more oriented to task and goal
achievement. The purpose of facilitation can thus vary,
ranging from "providing help and support to achieve a
specific goal" to "enabling individuals and teams to ana-
lyze, reflect and change their own attitudes, behaviours
and ways of working [p.580, [9]]." Facilitation also may
occur in variable forms, e.g., as a facilitator internal to an
implementation site, an external facilitator [i.e., QUERI
change agent], or a combination thereof. In the latter
instance, an external facilitator might work with an inter-
nal facilitator to develop his/her facilitation skills and
abilities and/or help to develop an enabling context.
Finally, facilitation has been described as an appointed
role that encompasses a wide range of techniques and
approaches [9].
Facilitation, as described to date, is a complex and multi-
faceted concept. Based on the current state of the evi-
dence, questions exist as to both: 1) Whether facilitation
is conceptually and operationally discrete from other
change agent interventions, such as educational outreach,
and 2) How facilitation relates to other types of interven-
tions or processes within a multi-faceted implementation
project [9]. Aspects of educational outreach, for example,
appear in some facilitation models but not others, and, as
Rycroft-Malone, et al[10] noted recently, there is a poten-
tial overlap of project management and facilitation. Addi-
tionally, there is a lack of common intervention
Implementation Science  2006, 1:23 http://www.implementation science.com/content/1/1/23
Page 3 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)definitions within the implementation field, as well as a
failure at times to differentiate planned versus actual oper-
ationalization of those interventions [11,12]. This makes
comparisons across studies difficult and adds to the lack
of clarity of any implementation concept, including facil-
itation. Further questions arise from the following:
• Use of internal, external, and/or a combined approach
to facilitation – again, at times without specification or
recognition of actual activities and divided responsibili-
ties; and
 Use of an external facilitator, evident in QUERI, working
across multiple and variable implementation sites (units
and/or facilities) from a central location within a health
care system.
In summary, findings from evaluative studies reflect the
diverse ways in which facilitation has been conceptual-
ized and applied. This makes it difficult to combine the
findings to draw meaningful conclusions about the nature
and effectiveness of facilitation as a distinct implementa-
tion intervention. According to Harvey and colleagues, the
findings from qualitative and quantitative studies do sug-
gest that a facilitator with face-to-face communication and
using a "range of enabling techniques has some impact on
changing clinical and organisational practice, although
the effect size is variable and associated with differing
costs [p.585, 9]." Exactly what enabling techniques influ-
ence change, with which type of facilitator, using what
type of approach, or in what type of setting or context
remains unclear.Purpose of the evaluation of QUERI facilitation 
experiences
The completion of a first wave of implementation projects
within QUERI provided an opportunity to explore the
concept of facilitation and highlight essential details of
the facilitator role. (See additional file 1, an Adobe Acro-
bat 7.0 PDF document: Study Projects per QUERI Team:
Related Goals and Implementation Interventions for a descrip-
tion of the multi-intervention strategy for each QUERI
study. Although facilitation was present at varying levels
in all the projects, it had not been recognized at the initi-
ation of these projects as a distinct activity or intervention.
This type of approach further highlights problems associ-
ated with making sense of multi-faceted interventions and
their related effects.)
The overall purpose of this evaluation was to raise con-
sciousness about the need to better understand the con-
cept of facilitation – and thereby enhance its deliberative
operationalization and encourage its explicit evaluation
in future QUERI research. More specific evaluative objec-
tives (see Table 2 for details) covered two aims: 1) To clar-
ify the precise nature of facilitation as a potentially
discrete versus diffuse intervention within an implemen-
tation strategy, and 2) To uncover critical issues requiring
future research.
The remainder of this paper contains a description of the
reflective method used to identify and analyze QUERI
facilitation experiences, a set of summarized findings with
detailed tables, and associated research implications.Table 1: QUERI description & key definitions
QUERI is an improvement initiative whe rein participating researchers ar e expected to simultaneously study the implementation process and work 
toward rapid and significant improvements in  the health of veterans, in terms of spe cific diseases and related problem areas. I t was initiated in 1998 
and is described as a comprehensive, data driven, outcomes-based and output-oriented quality improvement effort that focuses on  the rigorous 
application of best clinical pract ices into routine care/systems [15]
The term QUERI is used to refer to this overall VHA initiative and its national lead ership, as well as to specific QUERI teams that are organized 
around a disease or other issue-related entity (e.g., the Mental Health QUERI and the Spinal Cord Injury QUERI).
External facilitation refers to facilitation that comes from a ch ange agency outside of the implementation site; in this case, from a QUERI study tea m.
Implementation intervention or implementation tool is defined as a single method or  technique to facilita te change and, thereb y, adoption of best 
practice recommendations, e.g., an opinion leader, electronic clinical reminder, or in teractive education program. These also a re referred to as 
"uptake," "adoption," or "change" interventions.
Implementation strategy or program is defined as an integrated set (bundl e, package) of implementation interv entions. QUERI implementation studies 
typically evaluate implementation strategies or programs rather than individual in terventions, in that such an intervention is frequently insufficient to 
achieve implementation in complex clinical settings.
Internal facilitation refers to facilitation that would, if present, come from within an implementation study site.

Approach
A reflective exploration was the method chosen to gain in-
depth insights into the nature of facilitation across multi-
ple VA research projects. A reflective exploration is a proc-
ess that systematically stimulates and supports recall and
analysis of a past complex experience; in this case, involv-
ing interviews of a purposefully selected group of imple-
mentation research change agents. The approach was
based on Kolb's experiential 4-phase learning cycle [13].
As applied to this study, learning cycle phases paralleled
data collection and analysis processes, and progressed as
follows:
 Review of the concrete experience of facilitation,
through preparatory work and a structured interview;
 Conceptual reflection on that experience, in terms of
specific conceptual issues identified in a question-based
analysis; and
 Participation in a reflection on synthesized conceptuali-
zations and generalizations regarding facilitation, devel-
oped through thematic analysis and cross-interview
synthesis.
[See additional file 2, an Adobe Acrobat 7.0 PDF docu-
ment: Reflective Questions and Interviewee Preparatory
Work .]
A possible fourth phase was not part of this study (i.e.,
testing implications of concepts in new situations). How-
ever, selected questions were framed in a future perspec-
tive. For example, what should have happened in the
implementation study? What might have been more effec-
tive? And by implication, what should be done in the next
implementation study?Data collection method
An initial, one-to-two hour semi-structured telephone
interview was conducted with each participant. An imple-
mentation expert carried out the interviews (CBS), which
primarily captured qualitative data, while another team
member (ML) served as the note taker (except for her own
interview, the pilot) and participated in the interview if
clarification was required. Guided by the Kolb framework
[13], the reflective interview process focused on explora-
tion of the following topical areas:
 The nature of facilitation; its purpose, role, and function
 Facilitators and barriers to facilitation
 Factors distinguishing facilitation from other change
agent roles and implementation interventions
 Other influencing factors.
The initial interview was followed by a series of shorter
interviews and e-mail communications over approxi-
mately 7 months to obtain the iterative participant reflec-
tions required by the learning cycle. [See additional file 2:
Reflective Questions and Interviewee Preparatory Work , for
the detailed interview guide.]
Participants and sites
Seven VA researchers from six QUERI-related VA imple-
mentation projects agreed to participate in the evaluation.
All participants had been involved in explicit or implicit
facilitative processes, occasionally as a supporter and
supervisor of a facilitator.
Each QUERI project in which these interviewees had been
involved was designed with a goal of improving a specific
aspect of health care for a specific group of veterans. [SeeTable 2: Specific objectives of the QU ERI evaluative project on facilitation
1. Provide insights based on accumulated experiences regarding the following:
a. The operational nature of ex ternal and internal facilitation, ac ross multiple sites and across multiple implementation resea rch projects, within 
the VA.
b. The differentiation of facilitation from ot her change agent-related implementation ac tivities, such as opinion leadership, a s well as other 
relevant implementa tion interventions.
c. Facilitators of and barriers to facilitation.
d. The potential role of facilitation (b oth external and internal) as  a distinctly separate impl ementation intervention.
e. The essence of facilitatio n as a role or function.
i. Within a QUERI implementation study: Is it one function among many played by an Implementation Research Coordinator*? Do oth ers on 
the study team also play that function?
ii. Within a VISN:** Is it a role or function that might conceivably su pport the routine uptake of evidence?
2. Identify critical research qu estions regarding facilitation re lative to the above insights.
*Implementation Research Coordinator : The QUERI team member whose prim ary responsibility it is to ensure  inclusion of ed ucational, social, 
behavioral, and organizational sciences when the team is planning and executing implementation rese arch. This person also often  plays the role of 
the external facilitator.
**VISN: Veterans Integra ted Service Networks; the regionalized , clinical structural organization of the Veterans Administration's hea lth care 
delivery system; there ar e 23 such Networks.

(page number not for citation purposes)additional file 1: Study Projects .] The number of clinics or
study facilities involved in an individual QUERI project
ranged widely – from 4 to 23. Each interviewee partici-
pated in the execution of one of these projects as a study
team member and facilitator (or facilitator supervisor/
supporter).
The evaluation plan was submitted to the Human Sub-
jects Division at an organizer's home site (ML) and was
considered to be a QUERI quality review. The manuscript
was more recently presented to the same Human Subjects
Division (HSD) relative to its proposed publication in the
health care literature. In consultation with the University
of Washington Institutional Review Board Chair, the HSD
concluded that this work did not constitute human sub-
jects research and, therefore, did not need a certificate of
exemption. Nonetheless, specific ethical principles
regarding confidentiality and protection of data were
adopted. For example, it was agreed that the organizers of
the evaluation (CBS, ML, JR-M) would be the collectors
and analyzers of raw data and would maintain its confi-
dentiality; individual experiential data would be synthe-
sized across participants, so individual participant
experiences and perceptions would be anonymous; and
quotations used in any outputs would not include infor-
mation that identified the participant.
Analysis process
Following each interview, a detailed process was followed
to enhance reliability and trustworthiness of data acquisi-
tion, analysis and interpretation. Table 3 describes the
iterative process used to affirm accuracy of recorded expe-
riences, individual case interpretations, and cross-inter-
view syntheses. Interviewee participants received a draft
transcript of their own interview to ascertain whether they
believed it to be a true record and were invited to contrib-
ute any additional thoughts since the interview. Next,
interviewers organized and synopsized the raw experien-
tial report within each finalized interview to reflect an
interviewee's core, conceptual response to each question.
This draft analysis was provided to the participant for fur-
ther comment and affirmation or challenge.
As data were primarily qualitative, content analysis,
whereby data are broken down and subsequently built up
into themes, was employed following Huberman and
Miles [14]. In this case, responses across interviews were
clustered in relation to the pre-determined questions to
identify similar or distinct perceptions and experiences.
Common responses or themes across cases were identi-
fied. Interviewee quotes were linked to draft themes for
illustrative and clarifying purposes, and, where relevant,
distinct experiences that differed from the majority were
highlighted. Throughout the analysis process, the third
organizer [JR-M] acted as a critical reader, challengingemerging themes and hypotheses, and ensuring re-formu-
lation of ideas where appropriate.
Based on consensus of the interviewers [CBS & ML] and
evidence-based clarifications requested by JR-M, the draft
of this cross-case analysis was circulated to all partici-
pants. Affirmation or suggestions about alternate interpre-
tations or wording was requested during individualized
phone calls. Overall, participants reviewed and affirmed
the product at each step of the analysis, including the
summary of the cross-case synthesis.
Findings
Study findings are presented in terms of key issues that
emerged relative to the evaluative questions. In reading
the findings, the following context is of note:
 Implementation was being driven by a central agency
within the VA health care system external to practice sites
and was focused on creation of standard evidence-based
practice (EBP) throughout the system.
 The PARIHS model was familiar to many of the investi-
gators but was not used prescriptively; it also was not the
only potential definition of facilitation available to the
participants or QUERI teams.
 The concept of facilitation had to be operationalized by
each QUERI project, as none were given a detailed, oper-
ational set of guidelines for the emerging role.
 Most projects were placed under a tight timeline for
demonstrating rapid, targeted improvements in current
practice.
 Findings relate to an "external" facilitator role as
opposed to an "internal" facilitator role. [See Table 1.]
Local individuals directly involved in or assigned to an
active local role in a QUERI implementation project, and
interacting with the external facilitator, are henceforth
referred to as "internal change agents." Internal change
agents within implementation sites were variously termed
by QUERI project teams as a clinical champion, opinion
leader, site coordinator, site leader, or site team leader –
but not as a facilitator. As one interviewee noted, these
internal players were expected to implement the new prac-
tice and " figure out how to ensure that patients received the
recommended care ." In some projects, the person filling
this internal site role was a unit manager or held another
formal leadership role; in many projects it was a physi-
cian; and in others, the external facilitator worked with
"emergent groups " or " different individuals for different inter-
ventions," as each required a particular skill or role.

(page number not for citation purposes)The nature of facilitation
As experienced by these VHA implementation researchers,
facilitation is a valuable and critical process of interactive
problem-solving and support, which occurs in the context
of a recognized need for improvement and a supportive
interpersonal relationship. The recognized need is one
derived through research of best practice and diagnostic
analysis of a site's performance gaps [15].
In general, interviewees viewed the end goal of facilitation
as helping people in health care settings modify their
work to incorporate a specific evidence-based clinical
practice. This "helping" effort was seen to occur in general
through the support of locals' use of an evidence-based
implementation strategy – originally developed by the
research team (additional file 1: Study Projects ) – and
through provision of other assistive and encouraging
activities.
More specifically, interviewees identified the objectives of
external facilitation as follows:
1. To help internal change agent/s at implementation sites
understand what needs to change and how change can
occur. This involved identifying organizational or pro-
vider factors that could make it easier or harder to achieve
the adoption of a best practice; providing information
regarding the evidence, related changes and/or useful
problem solving linkages; and assisting in the reduction
of identified barriers to progress.
2. To provide support to internal change agent/s in the
form of encouragement, mentoring, and positive feed-
back, as appropriate.
The following individual participant comments highlight
these objectives [' you' and ' them' herein refer to the inter-
nal change agents as applicable]: "We can help you with problems and can help explain the
implementation interventions to you; these are the tools that
will help you, and we can help you use them."
 "Facilitation leads to enabling staff at the sites put the inter-
ventions in place, and to maintain and/or modify them over
time."
 "The essence of facilitation is trying to make things easier or
easiest to make changes. To help them understand how they
need to change, give them tools, monitor, and keep providing
support as necessary."
Facilitation and other roles
A key question about facilitation is whether it is different
from or part of other implementation interventions, proc-
esses or roles. Based on the experiences of these QUERI
interviewees, the following observations were made about
facilitation:
1. In its most concrete form, i.e., as an implementation
change agent or facilitator role, facilitation can be viewed
as a distinct intervention. However, in general interview-
ees suggested that facilitators will likely use or integrate
other implementation interventions while performing
this problem-solving/supportive function. For example,
they might provide education to enhance an internal
change agent's knowledge about the targeted evidence
and its credibility. The difference between education and
facilitation is, one suggested, related to " whether you are
using predetermined materials, identified at the beginning of
the project or whether you discover a need and develop or mod-
ify preexisting information for the use of those with the prob-
lem. You might even develop the education to meet requests of
the local personnel." Another said, " On the site visit, I came
in with a PowerPoint presentation. That is education. When
they called me for help ... that was different. It was facilita-
tion."Table 3: Reflective analysis process for experiential data
1. The transcribed text from the structured, interview-based reflection was affirmed or modified to create an accurate descript ion of an 
interviewee's facilitation experien ce through the following steps:
• Initial agreement between the interviewer (CBS) and recorder (ML),
• Review of this " cleaned" recording by the interviewee, and
• Revision by the interviewer/recorder unt il agreement was reached with the interviewee.
2. One of the implementation experts performed an initial question -based conceptual analysis of each individual interview (CBS) , after which the 
interviewer/recorder reached consensus as needed, followed by two additional steps:
• Conceptual review of this product by the interviewee for its affirmation or alternative interpretations as needed, and
• Revision by the interviewer/recorder unt il agreement was reached with the interviewee.
3. The interviewer, recorder and a member of the PARIHS framework team (JR-M) reac hed consensus on a final thematic analysis an d cross-case 
synthesis relative to pre-established exploratio n questions across the accumulated interview data.
• Review of this produc t by each interviewee,
• A final telephone discussion with each interviewee to obtain general consensus on the content/format of the report, and
• Review of final draft by all me mbers of the team, with final deci sions based on common perceptions.

(page number not for citation purposes)Facilitators also might help internal change agent/s under-
stand and utilize audit and feedback data provided by an
implementation research team, or use persuasive advo-
cacy/championing to reinforce the need for a targeted evi-
dence-based change in relation to local practice gaps. In
terms of the latter, another participant suggested, " Facili-
tation is not equivalent to marketing ... or networking. But,
facilitation can encompass those particular roles and be part of
making these roles easier." Yet another said, "It really has a
lot to do with creating buy-in/activating the sites/championing
the recommendations."
Two interviewees described their view of the distinctness
of facilitation as follows:
 "Facilitation is more general than other change roles – more
flexible. I think facilitation is a concept that addresses change
and the individuals who will create the change. Its precise char-
acter and activities will depend on the purpose of facilitation,
the structure in which people work, and the people with whom
the facilitator will work."
 "Facilitation is more two-way than other implementation
strategies, not as prescriptive, and is more adaptive and respect-
ful of what is in place."
2. Facilitation can occur at multiple levels within an
implementation project. Multiple individuals can contrib-
ute to such facilitative support in formal or informal ways.
Clinical leaders, for example, might help to remove a bar-
rier to change or a study team member (i.e., other than the
facilitator) can assist with a needed linkage to an outside
expert or a problem solver.
3. Facilitation may be considered a mediating implemen-
tation intervention or process [4] because it often enables
and supports actualization of other implementation inter-
ventions, such as electronic clinical reminders, audit and
feedback, or operational system changes. In reviewing the
final manuscript, one participant described it as the
"engine that drives the other [implementation] interventions
... [an] ingredient that makes them work ."
4. Within the context of action-oriented implementation
research such as QUERI [15], formal facilitation was seen
to begin when the external facilitator starts to establish a
working relationship with an internal change agent. Prior
to that point, as a member of the research team, facilita-
tors may participate in pre-implementation tool develop-
ment or other groundwork. As one participant explained,
"I did a lot of the developing of the implementation interven-
tions and related educational materials... this was not a part of
my facilitation role." This facilitator also described how " my
work changed from education to facilitation over time ."
Another interviewee talked about the difference betweenfacilitation and " getting them ready " for implementation,
and included educational outreach activities as part of the
latter groundwork.
5. The study team project management role within QUERI
was often separate from the facilitator role, or at the least
was seen as a separate set of functions. In addition to pre-
implementation groundwork such as decision-making
about interventions, diagnostic analysis of targeted sites,
development of toolkits, or engagement of leadership,
QUERI project management often focused on data collec-
tion, report development, scheduling of team meetings
and record maintenance.
Key components of external facilitation
As noted above, facilitators appear to help internal change
agents actualize an implementation plan and, thereby,
EBP through two key components of the facilitation proc-
ess, i.e., interactive problem solving and support . A summary
regarding distinct behaviors and activities related to these
two components of the external facilitator role are
described below, with further detail provided in Tables 4,
5, and 6.
Problem solving
The QUERI facilitator was described by participant
accounts as engaging in interactive, contingent problem
solving. QUERI facilitators were commonly depicted as a
problem solving resource for internal change agents, with
the intent to enable these internal agents to solve their
own problems. Facilitator – internal change agent problem
solving was seen as interactive because of the need for
ongoing dialogue and collaboration, and as contingent in
terms of the pre-determined evidence-based goal of the
QUERI project, the complexity of involved changes, and
the potentially differing needs of different sites.
Analysis of participant accounts resulted in identification
of three enabling and inter-connected aspects of problem-
solving, as illustrated below:
1. Problem identification and resolution (Table 4): This usu-
ally involved helping the internal change agent/s in each
site identify local problems and viable solutions, which
often varied from site to site. As three of the participants
described it: " Sometimes people were having trouble and we
helped them name the problem so we, or they, could seek help";
"It involves helping others to get whatever they are trying to do
done ... to help with the process... helping them through barri-
ers, talking them out, and giving advice"; and "We facilitators
engaged these players to identify problems and then go solve it
themselves."
Occasionally the external facilitator would take direct
action (i.e., the "doer/task function" in the PARIHS model
Implementation Science  2006, 1:23 http://www.implementation science.com/content/1/1/23
Page 8 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)[7,8]) but only in particular circumstances. For example,
the facilitator might take such actions in the case of a
problem requiring special expertise, or for role-modeling
purposes. As one participant explained, " Facilitation
focused on the idea of doing for and then they would do."
2. Use of formative data (Table 5): An inherent component
of problem identification and, at times, resolution is the
acquisition, review and use of data. QUERI external facil-
itators obtained and used multiple types of formative
data, which they may or may not have collected them-
selves. They used such information to enhance their abil-
ity to make needed changes at the site, provide real-time
feedback to internal change agent/s, and understand and
fulfill their own role. Examples of such formative data are
as follows:
 Status of pre-requisite implementation factors in the
local context, i.e., clinician perceptions regarding credibil-
ity of available clinical practice guidelines;
 How implementation was progressing from a fidelity/
integrity of innovation [11] and activity point of view, i.e.,
the degree to which the internal change agent/s and othersactually did institute identified components of the imple-
mentation strategy;
 How implementation was progressing in relation to out-
comes, e.g., the degree to which clinicians had adopted
recommended guidelines; and
 The nature of local factors that appeared to be essential
to the spread of implementation and progress, e.g., the
degree of visible leadership support or cooperation of
needed departments.
As individual participants said, " The facilitator worked to
gather data from them about barriers and problems"; "I asked
questions about the local context and sought to understand it";
and [At the start of implementation] "I made site visits to
learn about current clinic practices including, for example,
what they were doing about [X] ...by whom, how often, when....
And [I] did give them a lot of feedback on their practice once
they started the intervention."
3. Communication (Table 5): As the link between the study
team, implementation sites, and other relevant stakehold-
ers, external facilitators supported the exchange of infor-
mation through multiple communication channels. Thus,Table 4: The external facilitator role in problem identification/resolut ion: potential activities/beh aviors per QUERI experienc es

(page number not for citation purposes)facilitators tried to establish a means of regular, goal-
focused contact and became a resource and boundary
spanner [3,6] for ongoing information exchange or net-
working. As individual participants said, "If the opinion
leaders needed input from [another research team member],
they went through the facilitator"; "I could tell them how other
sites did it – give them information about solving problems";
and "Sometimes I could put them in contact with other clinics
that were doing well ... [and] I collected protocol books from all
the clinics, put them together, and shared it across clinics sothey could decide what to do." Such communication activi-
ties appeared to indirectly assist sites to solve problems
and to provide mechanisms for moral support among
internal change agent peers.
Support
One interviewee described the essence of facilitation as
"support and encouragement – more of a relationship where
you work with the team or identified person at the site, rather
than an outsider coming in with educational materials." OtherTable 5: The external facilitator role in  communication and formative use of data: potential activities/behaviors per QUERI

(page number not for citation purposes)interviewees described encouraging and helping internal
change agents [ICAs] feel that they – the ICAs – could
actualize implementation and, thus, enhance adoption of
the targeted evidence. For example, they talked about
"allowing and encouraging them to do their best to achieve
these goals"; and "You have to share that sense of goal achieve-
ment ... attainment in order to get there, in helping them. It
means cheerleading."
Overall, external facilitators tried to focus on enhancing
the ability of ICAs to succeed, strengthening their sense of
accomplishment, and reinforcing the fact that assistance
was at hand. Table 6 lists in more detail the essence of
establishing and maintaining a reciprocal, supportive,
problem-oriented interpersonal relationship, as experi-
enced by these interviewees. This support function also
appeared to involve helping ICAs understand what is
required to facilitate, which may involve clarifying expec-
tations for both the external change agency facilitator and
the ICA, and keeping these expectations realistic.
Factors related to the perc eived degree of success of 
external facilitation
There are barriers to and enablers of external facilitation,
at times reflecting either the absence or presence of the
same critical factor. Table 7 depicts this relationship in
terms of common themes across interviewee experiences
and sample quotes illustrating contrasting circumstances.
Four key factors and related observations were described
as follows:
1. Motivation/leadership at the sites: These interrelated ele-
ments came in the following forms:
 An identified or assigned individual at the site, i.e.,
the internal change agent, who needed both commit-
ment and time to put into the change process.
 Buy-in, or conversely, lack of support from formal
administrative and clinical leaders for the change ini-
tiative and internal change agent role/s. Active leader-
ship buy-in and support was observed, e.g., through
provision of needed resources, verbal reinforcement of
the importance of the initiative, and integration of
changes into routine QI structures. Conversely, lack of
support was noted in, e.g., a lack of responsiveness to
needed assistance from key departments.
2. Research team understanding and support of the external
facilitator role :
 Facilitation was a new concept to many of the
projects and not uniformly understood. However,
some teams were reported as having supportive mem-bers, such as those who recognized facilitation as a dis-
tinctive role that was critical to the team's work. An
example of this support was the perceived protection
of the facilitator's time to "facilitate."
 Study teams that did not make facilitation a distinct
or inherent part of the project were perceived as hav-
ing made support and communication with sites more
difficult, thus impeding optimization of implementa-
tion. As one participant further explained, "The prob-
lem was with how the implementation project was
organized and the emphasis on the outcome rates. If any-
thing, I think team members thought that telling staff to 'do
something' would suffice to 'implement' the interventions."
 It was agreed that both the implementation team
and external facilitator need the latter's role to be
explicitly defined, with a core of facilitation responsi-
bilities and behaviors.
3. Physical aspects of the facilitator role : Overlapping with
factors cited above is the element of maintaining contact
between the external QUERI facilitator and internal
change agent/s.
 In order to fulfill the interactive problem solving and
support function, interviewees felt they needed regular
communication, face-to-face contacts, and, at times,
onsite presence to attend meetings or directly observe
local discussions.
 In contrast, various interviewees reported not only
inaccessibility problems with internal change agents,
but also physical barriers of geographical distance, a
large number of sites and thus a large number of inter-
nal change agent/s, and the prohibitive cost of travel.
For example, external facilitators reported difficulty
teaching interactive skills at a distance or evaluating
related achievements.
4. Selection and assignment of an individual to the external
facilitator role : Interviewees reported that individuals
could have an easier or harder facilitator role depending
upon their skills, experiences, and/or personal attributes.
In general, they felt that an external facilitator had to be
able to develop positive relationships with individuals
and teams, have skills in problem solving, and have cred-
ible, relevant experience. Such experience might relate to
time within the VHA system, a previous facilitator role or
perhaps, in complex clinical situations, an applicable clin-
ical background.
A multi-faceted interview question was used to assess par-
ticipant views regarding the degree of "success" of facilita-
tion efforts. Data are from six interviewees, as one felt s/he
Implementation Science  2006, 1:23 http://www.implementation science.com/content/1/1/23
Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)couldn't judge success. Interviewee perceptions regarding
the success of individually identified and critical facilita-
tion behaviors ranged on a scale from 1 ( not at all effective )
to 5 ( very effective/successful ). In terms of the success of the
overall facilitative effort, on the same scale, two individu-
als rated facilitation as not effective ("1" and "2" respec-
tively), while remaining summary ratings averaged 3.25.
Perceptions of the overall success of individual QUERI
implementation projects were similar, with an average rat-
ing of 3.4.
The above responses usually were qualified, in that suc-
cess was said to vary across sites within a project. Forexample, one participant with an overall negative rating
said that it varied from " ...site to site because of the interven-
tion and the context. It differed by how much trust the team
members at a facility gave me. They didn't all see me as a prob-
lem solver."
Only one interviewee reported a significant degree of for-
mal facilitation measurement. That analysis suggested
"More facilitation yielded better results – except for one site,"
which may have had frequent contact due to resistance.
In those facilitation relationships perceived by interview-
ees to be more successful, one or more of the following

Facilitators* Barriers
Internal To The Implementation Sites
• Motivation for implementation • Lack of motivation for implementation
• Supportive leadership • Lack of leadership support
External to the Implementation Sites
• Sufficient contact with ICA** • Insufficient contact with ICA
• QUERI team that understands and supports the role • Lack of understanding or operationalization of the role by the QUERI

Sample Interviewee accounts
• "Some [sites] wanted to change and were ready ... this was a high priority for 
them."
• [A QUERI leader]... " being protective so the fac ilitators could do facilitation 
rather than project work...more explicitly , s/he 'made space' for the facilitators ."/H11568 "The concept of facilitation really wasn 't thought about in  a formal manner ... 
Data was more on the mind of the study team ."
•" My training and background in group dynamics... and ability to be flexible ."
• "I know it would be cost prohibitive to have an external person at every site, but 
that would be best. The teams need an external person to prod and answer 
questions ."/H11568 "Not being able to be there; not knowing what they are going through is a 
problem "
• "You need to ID the skills you need and hi re the people that fit that profile and

done, have charisma, and be able to inspire people to change ."/H11568 "Lack of motivation; lack of activation; lack of buy-in by lead provider ."
• "The most important thing is the level of bu y-in of the site lead provider. True of

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)factors, consistent with the above barrier/enhancer discus-
sion, were likely to be cited:
1. External facilitators were perceived by internal change
agents as having certain attributes, i.e., they were:
 Credible to the internal change agent/s, e.g., seen as
understanding the evidence;
 Good communicators, i.e., open to being contacted,
friendly, and outgoing, and having established good
rapport; and
 Flexible and responsive to the needs of the internal
change agent/s, i.e., either having answers to questions
or being able to find them.
2. The external facilitator had a history of relevant experi-
ence, needed skills, and a commitment to facilitation.
3. The external facilitator was based in a QUERI team that
from its inception recognized the value of facilitation and
supported the facilitator's ability to be successful.
Some illustrative comments from three interviewees
included the following: " They said I was easy to communi-
cate with, readily available. I returned calls. I either had
answers or would find them." Another was said to "...have
had a great rapport," and a third felt that a facilitator had to
be "...someone who is well-liked." In terms of a clinical back-
ground, one said, " With no clinical background, it is difficult
to talk to MDs. You need to understand what it is like being in
the trenches ." While another (a clinician by background)
indicated " It isn't as important as personal skills...I could
always refer them to literature or an MD."
In contrast, those facilitation relationships or encounters
perceived as not very successful were more likely charac-
terized by interviewees and interviewers with one or more
of the overlapping factors on the following list.
1. The individual who might have played an active facili-
tator role was more focused, per research team require-
ments, on project study management activities such as
data collection and other evaluation duties.
2. The person who was in contact with the internal change
agent/s was not introduced as, nor supported to work as a
"problem solver ." One said, "My role got watered down. We
didn't have answers to barriers so the participants got worn
down, discouraged." Another was felt to have had an inap-
propriate " level of problem solving skills."
3. Responsibility for success of the project was delegated
to the sites in the form of internal change agent/s, cited as"local champions" or "site leaders ," but without the support
of structured QUERI facilitation, internal support, or
appropriate selection.
4. Particularly in the early phases of implementation in
the VHA, facilitation was not consistently addressed nor
supported in an explicit, structured manner at a project
team level.
Study limitations
This evaluation was both small scale and reliant on self-
report data, thus potentially limiting the generalizability
of findings. Additionally, its purposively sampled partici-
pants represented a specific perspective and are likely EBP
enthusiasts, particularly in terms of facilitation. However,
data and findings would suggest that interviewees were
able to reflect and report their experiences in a considered
and balanced way; and the authors have attempted to pro-
vide sufficient information, in terms of methods, findings
and context, to enable readers to make a judgment as to
the rigor of the approach and transferability of findings to
settings with which they are familiar. The dual role of ML
as an interviewee and note taker was a potential source of
bias, but a number of steps were taken to minimize this
possible effect. For example, ML was interviewed first and
took a mainly passive role in interviews. Furthermore, an
iterative affirmation process was employed throughout
the evaluation [see Table 3], and a third person acted as a
critical reader, challenging or affirming data collection as
well as analysis processes and outcomes.
Discussion
Several authors have noted that the concept of facilitation
has yet to be thoroughly defined and, thus, is challenging
to integrate effectively into implementation research
[3,9,16]. The QUERI reflective evaluation reported here,
despite its limited scope, provides sufficiently suggestive
findings from its multiple implementation experiences to
highlight key aspects of the concept of facilitation – both
in relation to the existing literature and the design of
future implementation projects within and beyond the
VHA.
Purpose, nature and role of facilitation
Interviewees from QUERI discussed the purpose of their
facilitation efforts – actual and as desired in the future – in
terms of interactive problem solving to meet specific
implementation goals. This finding is consistent with
Roger's definition of a change agent [5], as "an individual
who influences clients' innovation decisions in a direction
deemed desirable by a change agency." Therefore, it is dif-
ferent from facilitating a change that involves open-ended
implementation goals and objectives.
Implementation Science  2006, 1:23 http://www.implementation science.com/content/1/1/23
Page 13 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)The QUERI description of facilitation as a form of interac-
tive problem solving also is consistent with a recently
published concept analysis by Thompson, et al. [18] that
identified the facilitator role as active, dynamic and task-
oriented. Furthermore, interviewees' emphasis upon the
criticality of the role's support element reinforces findings
of both Harvey, et al.'s concept analysis that concluded
"the facilitator role is about supporting people to change
their practice [p.585,9]," as well as recent empirical work
by Cheater, et al[17] and Wallin, et al. [16].
In terms of the PARIHS definition and purpose of facilita-
tion, there is an obvious overlap with this study's findings
relative to the concept of a "helping and enabling" role
[7,8]. The heuristic definition that emerged from QUERI
experiences further emphasizes what PARIHS would call
the "task orientated approach" but provides more explicit
operational detail about the "focused process of providing
help and support to achieve a specific task [p.177, [8]]."
Unlike the 2002 PARIHS description, QUERI facilitators
at times did use "telling or persuading," given the goal of
the external change agency.
In general, QUERI interviewees felt that facilitation could
be a distinct entity, but questions still remain as to exactly
how this problem solving and supportive function sets
facilitators apart from other change agent roles, such as
educational outreach/academic detail workers, opinion
leaders, or champions. To some extent the findings from
this evaluation support Harvey, et al. [9] in that QUERI
interviewees described their facilitation role as broader
than the educational outreach model; i.e., because as facil-
itators they engaged in more, and differently targeted
interventions. For example, interviewees described their
role in diagnosing and modifying contextual factors, and
in being a boundary spanner/intermediary between
organizations and other stakeholders. Arguably, educa-
tional outreach workers tend not to focus their efforts on
context or on providing a mediating function.
Additionally, there may be some overlap between facilita-
tion and project management. While participants in this
study viewed their facilitation role as distinct from a
project management role, in reality there may at times be
blurring of role boundaries and tasks undertaken. Accord-
ing to the findings of this evaluation and those of Harvey,
et al. [9], the distinction between a facilitation interven-
tion and project management role seems to be one of
intention and scope. A facilitation intervention, for exam-
ple, is concerned with enabling the implementation of
evidence into practice using a wide repertoire of skills and
a flexible approach to working with individuals and teams
in an enabling way. On the other hand, project manage-
ment is not necessarily about enabling the process of evi-
dence implementation and is potentially more restrictivein its scope, remit and enactment. More research is obvi-
ously needed to determine the specific differences
between facilitation and project management roles.
In Thompson, et al.'s concept analysis [18], various roles
of "intermediaries and influentials" in the transfer of
knowledge were reviewed, revealing persistent confusion
regarding both standard definitions of individual roles
and cross-role similarities/differences. In terms of the
roles reviewed – i.e., opinion leaders, facilitators, champi-
ons, linking agents and change agents – Thompson, et al.
concluded that these specific "concepts may indeed be
similar phenomena with different labels [p. 691, [18]]."
A facilitator in the QUERI study clearly can be defined as
a change agent [5], as well as a linking agent between the
internal change agent and the broader environment.
However, as Thompson, et al. also found, "there
are...many differences that suggest that these [reviewed]
concepts are conceptually unique [p. 691, [18]]." For
example, external QUERI facilitators did not conform to
various descriptions of either an opinion leader (i.e., an
internal individual who is informally well-connected and
has a wide peer and social network) or a champion (i.e.,
an individual who emerges unsolicited and has visionary
qualities).
Personal attributes
A number of individual factors were highlighted by inter-
viewees believed critical to the success of a facilitator's
role. This included flexibility, relevant experience (as facil-
itators or as clinical process experts within the VHA),
knowledge (e.g., regarding the evidence), and the ability
to build relationships through good communication. The
facilitators in this study were required to be flexible by
adopting different styles (e.g., directive and non-directive)
depending on the projects, specific sites, related progress,
and individuals involved. These findings support others'
work. For example, Cheater, et al. [17] found that flexibil-
ity and the ability to draw on a repertoire of skills sup-
ported the functioning of the facilitation role in an
exploratory trial. Additionally, Wallin, et al. [16] describe
the positive benefits of guideline implementation facilita-
tors having knowledge about managing change, as well as
having insight into the clinical topic, which they call being
'content aware.' Furthermore, Greenhalgh, et al.'s observa-
tions regarding external change agents [6] suggest that
facilitators need to have credibility and be appropriately
"trained and supported to develop... interpersonal rela-
tionships with potential users [p.26]." Thompson, et al.'s
review generally echoes these observations [18].
In summary, and as Harvey, et al. [9] surmise, collective
findings to date, including this evaluation, indicate that to
be effective, facilitators need to be flexible and possess a
Implementation Science  2006, 1:23 http://www.implementation science.com/content/1/1/23
Page 14 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)range of skills to be used according to the needs of those
with whom they are working and the related context.
Facilitators and barriers
A number of facilitating and hindering factors were iden-
tified in this evaluation, including the need for protected
time, leadership support, and recognition of the impor-
tance of the facilitation role. The issue of protected time is
one seen frequently in the evidence into practice imple-
mentation literature [10,19]. Clearly the resolution of
such issues is not straightforward, and it would be naïve
to suggest that just providing protected time for facilita-
tors would enhance the success of projects. In the case of
this evaluation, perhaps protected time was an indicator
of the degree of organizational investment or support. For
those project teams that did not understand or value the
facilitator role, this resource was not forthcoming and,
thus, was unavailable to help optimize change.
Conclusion
Facilitation is a word and concept that is used frequently,
yet poorly understood. There are few explicit descriptions
or rigorous evaluations of the concept within the field of
implementation. The findings of this small-scale, reflec-
tive evaluation suggest that facilitation could be consid-
ered a well-planned, proactive, supportive and mediating
change agent role, and thus a discrete intervention that
can enable site activation and enhance implementation of
new, evidence-based practices. However, there are many
questions that remain outstanding regarding the nature
and effectiveness of facilitation. Table 8 lists one set of
research questions that emerged from this evaluative
study. In the future, facilitation needs to be explicitly stud-
ied both as an internal and external role intervention to
better define its specific contribution to the success of
implementation in different types of projects, different
types of context, and with evidence and innovations of
different levels of complexity. Its potential as one of the
key ingredients in successful implementation, as the PAR-
IHS model suggests, might then be realized.
