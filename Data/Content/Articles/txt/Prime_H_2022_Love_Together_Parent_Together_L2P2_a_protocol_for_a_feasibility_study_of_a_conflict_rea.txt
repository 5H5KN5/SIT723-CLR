Abstract 
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced or amplified stress and challenge within couples’ relation-
ships. Among those who are particularly vulnerable to heightened conflict and lower relationship satisfaction during 
this time are interparental couples with young children, whose relationships may have already been tenuous prior to 
the pandemic. Stress within the interparental relationship may have ripple effects on all family subsystems and child 
adjustment. The Love Together Parent Together (L2P2) program is a brief, low-intensity writing intervention adapted 
for parents of young children that was designed to reduce conflict-related distress and prevent declines in relation-
ship satisfaction. Based on an original writing intervention by Finkel and colleagues, L2P2 has adapted the interven-
tion duration and study population to be appropriate to the current global context. This study will examine the key 
feasibility metrics related to this adapted program with the goal of identifying problems and informing parameters of 
future pilot and/or main RCTs.
Methods: The current study is a non-randomized feasibility study, using a single-arm, pre-test/post-test design to 
primarily assess the feasibility of an evaluative RCT, and to secondarily assess the potential effects on outcomes to be 
used in a future RCT. Couples will be recruited through three community-based agencies with the goal of obtaining a 
socio-demographically diverse sample. The first 20 couples to enroll will be included. Baseline and post-intervention 
surveys will be conducted, and a writing intervention will take place (three 7-min sessions over the course of 5 
weeks). The primary outcomes will be feasibility metrics of recruitment rates, appropriateness of eligibility criteria, 
sample diversity, retention, uptake, adherence, and acceptability. In addition, we will develop an objective measure 
of couple “we-ness” based on an analysis of writing samples. The secondary outcomes will include couples’ measures 
(i.e., relationship quality, perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported responsiveness, conflict-related distress), and 
additional family outcomes (i.e., parent-child relations, parental/child mental health). Criteria for success are outlined, 
and failure to meet the criteria will result in adaptations to the measurement schedule, intervention design, recruit -
ment approach, and/or other elements of the program.
Discussion: This feasibility study will inform several components of the procedures used for a subsequent pilot 
RCT, in which we will examine the feasibility of the methodology used to evaluate the program (e.g., randomization,

Introduction
Couples’ relationships during COVID‑19: implications 
for young families
The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced heightened 
levels of stress for many couples that increase the 
risk of harmful dyadic processes such as decreased 
responsive support, hostility, and withdrawal [1 ]. 
Some couples’ relationships may be particularly vul -
nerable due to pre-pandemic stressors― namely, 
couples with young children. Indeed, the transition 
to parenthood is a challenging time, and negative 
changes to couples’ satisfaction often persist beyond 
the first year postpartum [2 ]. For instance, using a 
large and diverse community sample of mothers, one 
study found that more than 20% of mothers reported 
high and worsening relationship conflict over the 
early childhood period [3 ]. In the current pandemic, 
this developmental stage of parenthood is further 
threatened by distinct strains experienced by many 
parents. Pandemic-related stressors, including finan -
cial, family, and pandemic-specific factors, have been 
linked to parental mental health, particularly among 
mothers [4 ], with parents reporting higher levels of 
depression and anxiety [5 ] and more frequent use of 
alcohol as a coping strategy compared to non-parents 
[6]. Given the importance of individual mental health 
to the well-being of couples, this represents a time of 
acute stress to interparental relationships, which may 
have lasting effects.
Interparental relationships form the foundation of 
healthy family functioning, with strong evidence for 
spillover effects from the interparental relationship to 
other family systems [7 , 8] and child adjustment [9 ]. 
This may be especially true under conditions of risk 
[10], including stress emanating from the pandemic 
[11]. As such, threats to the interparental relationship 
during this time represent a family-wide risk factor. It 
is therefore important to provide access to evidence-
based interventions aimed to prevent the deteriora -
tion of interparental relationships during and after the 
pandemic, with implications for the entire family. The 
current protocol describes a study that will assess the 
feasibility and acceptability of an interparental interven -
tion designed to combat declines in relationship quality 
amid this global crisis.Potential utility of a brief intervention
Prior to the pandemic, there were calls for increased 
translational research to inform large-scale couples’ 
interventions [12]. In the current context, the widespread 
and far-reaching threat of pandemic stress has made this 
need even more salient. Introducing novel, brief inter -
ventions to address couples’ relationships has the poten -
tial to mitigate accessibility challenges related to reach 
and retainment [13]. One brief intervention, deemed the 
“Marriage Hack, ” targets maladaptive conflict patterns 
by encouraging couples to reappraise their disagree -
ments from a neutral, third-party perspective [14]. This 
low-resource intervention, which involves three 7-min 
writing sessions (for a total of a 21-min intervention), 
has been shown to buffer against normative declines in 
marital quality over time by reducing conflict-related 
distress. Such an intervention has the potential for wide -
spread scale-up among couples at risk for relationship 
deterioration. In addition to its brief nature, it also has 
the advantage of being a fully online intervention, and 
will therefore reduce access barriers inherent to the pan -
demic and to couples with young children.
The need for a feasibility study
The overarching goal of this research program is to eval -
uate the effectiveness of the Marriage Hack intervention 
using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a new 
sample―couples of young children. In addition, we 
will examine the impact of the intervention on the inter -
parental relationship as well as other family relationships, 
which was not a goal of the original intervention.
The current intervention resembles the original inter -
vention in almost all aspects, with the exception of the 
timing of the intervention. Specifically, to optimize reach 
and retainment, we will adapt the intervention from its 
original 12-month course to run over a 5-week time -
frame. The number of writing sessions will remain the 
same (i.e., three sessions) but will be expedited to one ses -
sion every 2 weeks. To this end, there is strong evidence 
that brief and precise relationship interventions that aim 
to alter specific psychological processes―such as con -
flict reappraisal―can lead to significant benefits over 
time, including in higher-risk samples [15].
The original study was conducted with a relatively low-
risk sample in terms of risk for couple-related distress. attrition to follow-up assessment/across groups, and sample size estimation, preliminary effectiveness), as well as the 
main RCT, which will investigate the effectiveness of the intervention on primary outcome measures and mediating 
pathways.

The current study is considered a secondary prevention 
program in that we are targeting couples at risk for rela -
tionship difficulties based on the developmental stage 
(couples with young children) and context (a global cri -
sis). We expect this intervention to be effective for this 
new study population, as poor cognitive reappraisal skills 
are an important contributor to marital dissatisfaction in 
high-risk couples [16], and they buffer against the nega -
tive impact of marital conflict on marital satisfaction in 
a range of couples (i.e., newly married and remarried) 
[17]. Taken together, the use of a brief conflict reap -
praisal intervention to address negative conflict dynam -
ics is expected to lead to benefits for couples in distress, 
including parents with young children.
Best practice for establishing effectiveness through an 
RCT requires a step-wise approach: (1) a feasibility study 
to address specific elements of the RCT (e.g., interven -
tion characteristics), (2) a pilot RCT to address barri -
ers and inform parameters of the main RCT, and (3) the 
main RCT to assess effectiveness [18]. The current pro -
tocol describes a non-randomized, single-arm feasibil -
ity study (step 1 above), with the aim to assess feasibility, 
identify and rectify problems, and increase the success of 
a future evaluative RCT.
Objectives
The primary aim of the current study is to assess the 
feasibility and other methodological components of the 
Love Together, Parent Together (L2P2) intervention to 
inform the parameters of a future pilot (step 2 above) and 
main RCT (step 3 above). L2P2 is a brief conflict reap -
praisal program for couples with young children designed 
to support whole family functioning. The primary objec -
tives of the current feasibility study are as follows:
(1) Recruitment: Establish partnership with three 
recruitment sources and examine recruitment rates 
to determine if additional recruitment sources are 
needed.
(2) Sample: Assess whether our recruitment approach 
and eligibility criteria are appropriate for the 
intended sample (i.e., participants with mild to 
moderate levels of couple distress as in a secondary 
preventive intervention). Relatedly, we are inter -
ested in the heterogeneity of the sample obtained 
through this recruitment approach based on sample 
demographics including income/education level, 
racial/ethnic identification, immigration status, and 
sexual orientation/gender identity.
(3) Program: Assess program retention, adherence, and 
uptake rates―that is, the extent to which par -
ticipants complete the assessment schedule in full, 
engage in the three writing (intervention) sessions, and report the use of conflict-reappraisal strategies 
in between sessions.
(4) Measurement: Conduct a preliminary validation of 
a primary outcome measure of couple “we-ness” 
[19] based on a content analysis of writing samples 
collected during the intervention. This new meas -
ure will be used in conjunction with pre-existing 
self-report measures of perceived partner respon -
siveness and responsiveness towards one’s partner 
for a multi-method/multi-informant assessment 
approach in subsequent pilot/main RCTs.
(5) Acceptability: Examine the acceptability of the 
adapted intervention. We will examine whether the 
acceptability of the intervention varies as a function 
of key sociodemographic variables such as gender, 
race/ethnicity, and immigration status.
The secondary objective is to explore preliminary 
effects on couples’ measures (i.e., relationship quality, 
perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported respon -
siveness, conflict-related distress), and other family out -
comes (i.e., parent-child relations, parent/child mental 
health) to see if the expected changes are evident follow -
ing participation in the intervention.
Methods
The current protocol is written in accordance with a 
guide to the reporting of protocols of pilot and feasibil -
ity trials [ 20], guidelines for reporting non-randomized 
pilot and feasibility studies [ 21], and the CONSORT 
extension to pilot and feasibility trials [ 22], with adap -
tations for the current non-randomized design. In 
addition, we have adhered to the SPIRIT guidelines 
for reporting protocols. The current protocol was reg -
istered on Clini calTr  ials. gov ( NCT05 143437), where 
amendments to the protocol will also be documented.
Study design
The current study is a non-randomized feasibility study, 
using a single-arm, pre-test/post-test design. Couples will 
be recruited via three recruitment platforms via email 
listservs. The first 20 couples who meet the eligibility cri -
teria and consent to the research process (self-directed, 
online) will be included in the study. Baseline assessments 
will include surveys collecting information on participant 
sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related 
stress, self-report measures of couples’ distress, relation -
ship quality, parenting practices, responsiveness directed 
towards partner, and perceived partner responsiveness, 
as well as the mental health of self and one target child. 
The intervention will take place over 5 weeks, with a 
total of three 7-min writing intervention sessions. At the 
Page 4 of 10 Prime et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:170 
beginning of each intervention session, participants will 
complete a brief survey of conflict frequency, as well as 
the use of conflict reappraisal strategies since the last ses -
sion. A post-intervention survey will include all meas -
ures from baseline (except COVID-19-related stress and 
demographics), in addition to an acceptability survey.
Participants
Eligibility criteria are as follows: (i) both participants 
endorse being in a relationship, (ii) partners reside in 
the same home, (ii) one or more children under the age 
of 6 living at home, (iii) both participants are over age 18 
years, and (iv) both members of a couple agree to partici -
pate. Exclusion criteria included (i) no current plans or 
history of separation or divorce (as this is meant to be a 
secondary preventative intervention for couples experi -
encing mild-to-moderate but not severe relationship dif -
ficulties). Of note, the participant pool was considered 
at-risk due to developmental stage (couples with young 
children) and context (pandemic); however, we did not 
screen for relationship distress for the purposes of eli -
gibility criteria. Instead, we plan to look at this descrip -
tively (i.e., proportion of couples with mild-moderate risk 
for relationship distress).
Recruitment sources, who were involved from the out -
set of the study and consulted on study design, include 
(1) Moms at Work, a community, education, and advo -
cacy group supporting women in their careers; (2) 
Unemployed Help Centre of Windsor Inc., a nonprofit 
organization assisting the un/underemployed and dis -
advantaged person during the transition period in the reemployment process; and (3) EarlyOn Child and Family 
Centres, who offer free, high-quality programs for young 
families. These recruitment sources were selected to get a 
range of participants in terms of potential risk factors for 
relationship problems.
Listserv members from each recruitment source will 
receive an invitation to participate in research with a 
direct contact link to the L2P2 study platform via Qual -
trics. Participants will go through an eligibility screen, 
followed by a review of a letter of information and 
informed consent. Once participants have consented, 
they will be asked for their contact information and that 
of their partner (if they are the first member of the cou -
ple to sign up). The second member of the couple will be 
contacted directly by the study team via email with an 
invitation to enroll. Once both members of a couple have 
enrolled, they will be given couple and participant IDs, 
and a survey schedule will be set up and executed. For a 
schematic diagram of the time schedule of enrollment, 
intervention, and assessments, see Table 1.
Intervention
Given that this is a single-arm design, only an inter -
vention group will be described. The intervention ses -
sions will consist of two stages. First, participants will 
be asked to provide a “summary of a time when you and 
your romantic partner did not agree in the last 2 weeks... ” 
focusing on “you and your partner’s actions (what you 
said and did), not about what you were thinking or feel -
ing. ” Second, participants will be asked to engage in a

writing task wherein they will be instructed to reappraise 
the conflict they previously reported based on the follow -
ing prompts [14]:
“Think about this disagreement with your partner 
from the perspective of a third party who wants the 
best for all involved. This is a person who sees things 
from a neutral point of view. How might this person 
think about the disagreement? How might this per -
son find the good that could come from it?”
“Some people find it helpful to take this third-party 
perspective when they are with their romantic part -
ner. However, almost everybody finds it hard to take 
this third-party perspective at all times. In your 
relationship with your partner, what might make it 
hard to take this third-party perspective, especially 
when you’re having a disagreement with your part -
ner?”
“Even though it is hard to take a third-party per -
spective, people can do it. Over the next two weeks, 
please try your best to take this third-party perspec -
tive when you are with your romantic partner, espe -
cially during disagreements. How might you be able 
to take this perspective in your interactions with 
your partner over the next two weeks? How might 
taking this perspective help you make the best of dis -
agreements in your relationship?”
Participants will receive email reminders 1 week after 
each intervention session to prompt the use of the reap -
praisal task. Email reminders first remind them of the 
prompts they wrote about during the writing session. 
Participants are then encouraged to use the conflict reap -
praisal strategy, as follows:
“As you go through your daily life, please keep in 
mind the benefits of adopting a third-party perspec -
tive in your romantic relationship. Sometime today 
(now, if the timing works), please take a few moments 
to think about ways you can take this point of view 
about conflicts in your romantic relationship. ”
There are no criteria for discontinuing or modifying 
allocated interventions. Participants will be informed 
that they can withdraw from participation in the study 
at any time and that they do not need to complete 
all questions in surveys or writing sessions. Partici -
pants who withdraw prematurely will be compared to 
completers on baseline demographic and relationship 
characteristics.
Several steps will be taken to enhance recruitment 
efforts and applicability of the intervention to the study 
population and to improve adherence to intervention protocols. These steps were developed, in part, through 
consultation with recruitment partners (listed above). 
Recruitment flyers will be distributed online and in per -
son. The study will be conducted online to reduce barri -
ers to participation. The survey and intervention sessions 
will be made available for mobile and/or computer users 
to enhance access and promote adherence. The language 
used in study materials (e.g., writing prompts) will be 
simplified (i.e., the use of terms such as “disagree” rather 
than “conflict”). Remuneration of participants will occur 
as the study progresses (i.e., after each session) via email 
in the form of a choice of gift card. Specifically, each par -
ticipant will receive $5.00 for the baseline survey, $10.00 
for each of the three intervention sessions, and $5.00 for 
the post-intervention survey ($40.00 per participant for 
full participation). Reminders of study timelines and sur -
vey/intervention session expiry dates will be provided by 
email.
Outcomes and analysis
Table  2 presents all the study objectives with associated 
outcomes and criteria for success of feasibility, hypoth -
esis for secondary outcomes, and methods of analyses, 
when applicable. Feasibility outcomes will be reported 
descriptively using descriptive statistics, means (standard 
deviations), and frequencies/percentages. Analyses for 
pre-post change and validation of an objective primary 
outcome measure are described in Table  2. If success 
indicators are not met, we will make changes to the study 
design accordingly (e.g., expand recruitment sources, 
adjust eligibility criteria, adapt intervention schedule, 
and/or compensation). Analyses will include all partici -
pants who complete baseline assessments. We will use 
Bayesian estimation, which is more robust with small 
sample sizes [32].
Sample size
The targeted sample size for the current study is 20 
couples. This was considered sufficient to identify a 
pattern in rates of recruitment over several weeks 
(expected five couples per week) and to offer a large 
enough sample to gauge the appropriateness of eligibil -
ity criteria and reasons for exclusion, diversity of sam -
ple, retention, adherence, and uptake. In addition, 20 
couples are sufficient for accurate Bayesian estimation 
in the context of multilevel modeling [32], which will 
be used for preliminary analyses examining pre-post 
change in future study outcomes. We kept the sample 
size to a minimum for the purposes of reserving study 
resources for a planned pilot RCT.
The current protocol does not include stopping or dis -
continuing guidelines.

Data management
No data entry is required as participants provide 
responses directly into Qualtrics. Study protocols have 
been developed by the principal investigator (PI: first 
author) which outline clear steps for enrolling study 
participants and scheduling surveys and compensa -
tion schedules. Data quality checks will be conducted at 
regular check points throughout data collection by the 
PI. Steps will be taken to ensure linking of participants 
within couples and over time and independent com -
pletion of surveys. Embedded data will be used across 
surveys to ensure consistency in reporting on specific 
children. Range checks will be conducted on all data to 
ensure valid values.
Ethics and dissemination
Ethics approval has been granted by York University 
(Certificate #: e2021-266). Changes to the protocol will 
be reported in the publication of the study findings. 
Informed consent will be completed online (see Addi -
tional file 1).
All information provided by participants will be kept 
private and confidential. An electronic file linking par -
ticipant contact information with their couple identi -
fication numbers will be only accessible by the PI (first 
author) and research coordinator. Qualtrics servers will 
contain email addresses linked to each participant’s data 
to allow for communication with participants (i.e., send -
ing out reminders and surveys). Any data shared with the 
research team will contain only the participant codes and 
will be securely transferred using an encrypted email or 
secure server.
All study data will be temporarily stored on Qualtrics 
before anonymized records are sent to York Univer -
sity secure servers (OneDrive). Qualtrics is protected 
by high-end firewall systems. Qualtrics uses Transport 
Layer Security (TLS) encryption (also known as HTTPS) 
for all transmitted data. Anonymized data will be made 
available to the senior investigators (first, second, and 
senior authors) and their research assistants and students 
(current and future) under the direct supervision of the 
research team.
We will destroy any personally identifiable data at the 
end of the study. We will keep non-identifiable data to 
comply with open science and data sharing practices, as 
well as to allow for future analysis of data.
Dissemination plans include traditional outlets (e.g., 
peer-review journals and conferences), and sharing with 
the general public through social media and community 
talks (in conjunction with recruitment partners). Ameri -
can Psychological Association “Publication Practices and Responsible Authorship” guidelines will be used to deter -
mine authorship.
Discussion
The main objective of the current feasibility study is to 
examine the feasibility, acceptability, and practicality of 
an adapted intervention designed for couples with young 
children during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Con -
siderations relate to processes, resources, and scientific 
factors such as recruitment rates, appropriateness of 
eligibility criteria and sample diversity, retention, adher -
ence, and uptake, primary outcome measure develop -
ment, and preliminary examination of change in outcome 
measures. We will also conduct a participant survey to 
assess the acceptability of the intervention program, 
stratified by subgroups.
Findings will inform the parameters and research pro -
tocol of a future pilot RCT, the aim of which will be to 
assess the feasibility of examining the effectiveness of the 
intervention program in a subsequent main RCT. Spe -
cifically, we expect the results of this feasibility study to 
inform what changes may need to occur, if any, prior to 
executing the pilot RCT.
In the subsequent pilot and main RCTs, we will be able 
to ask more nuanced questions about whether “wise inter -
ventions”― that is, brief and precise interventions that 
target specific psychological processes― can be used 
with higher-risk samples to address coercive relation -
ship dynamics, with potential benefits over time. To this 
end, our broader research program will address questions 
about whether there is differential effectiveness of such 
interventions on couples based on initial risk levels (e.g., 
pandemic-related stress and/or dyadic adjustment), which 
will speak to the utility of using the intervention with low, 
mild-moderate, and high-risk couples. The program of 
research will also answer questions about the potential 
cascading effects of wise interventions not only within 
individuals (intra-individual effects), but between part -
ners of a couple (inter-individual effects), and extending 
to other family systems (e.g., coparenting and parent-child 
relationships). Finally, findings from the broader research 
program will inform the rapidly evolving literature on 
technology-assisted family-based interventions. For 
instance, there is some evidence that technology-assisted 
parenting interventions are optimized when individuals 
have direct contact with a practitioner [33]. The current 
research program will address whether an online, self-
directed couples’ relationship intervention is sufficient 
for enhancing couples’ relationship quality, with findings 
informing future iterations of the program, including the 
potential benefits of direct contact with a facilitator.

With appropriate adaptations, the Marriage Hack pre -
sented by Finkel and colleagues (2013) has the potential 
to meet a pressing need for a widescale program to pre -
vent the sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic on inter -
parental relationships, family functioning, and child 
adjustment. The current feasibility study is a critical first 
step to ensuring the successful implementation of future 
pilot and main RCTs that will investigate the effectiveness 
of using this intervention with a new population (couples 
with young children) and in the context of an ongoing 
pandemic and its aftermath.
