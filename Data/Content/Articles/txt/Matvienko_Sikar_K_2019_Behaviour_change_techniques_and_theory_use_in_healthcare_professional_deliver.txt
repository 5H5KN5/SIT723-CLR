ABSTRACT
The conceptual basis of early childhood feeding interventions for obesity
prevention is poorly understood. The aim of this systematic review is to
characterise these interventions ’use of behaviour change techniques
(BCTs) and psychological theory, focusing on interventions delivered by
healthcare professionals for children ≤2 years. We searched seven
electronic databases from inception to January 2019 and identi ﬁed 12
trials. BCTs and theory use were identi ﬁed using the Behaviour Change
Technique Taxonomy v1 and the Theory Coding Scheme respectively.
Interventions used 19 BCTs, most commonly ‘Instruction on how to
perform the behaviour ’(12 of 12 studies) and ‘Social support
(unspeci ﬁed)’(8 of 12 studies). The mean number of BCTs used was 5.1.
Six trials explicitly stated basing interventions on theory, mostcommonly social cognitive theory and responsive feeding (4 of 6 studieseach). Links between theory use and BCTs were poor. Early childhood
feeding interventions have insu ﬃciently integrated psychological
theories into their development and evaluation. We recommend greaterconsideration of psychological theory incorporating family and systems
approaches and responsive feeding in future intervention development.Moreover, these theories should explicitly link with BCTs. These theories
and BCTs should also be included in the evaluation phase.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Childhood obesity is associated with reduced quality of life and increased risk of morbidity in
childhood and later life (Reilly & Kelly, 2011 ). Obesity in childhood tracks into adulthood and increases
the risk of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke (Ma ﬀeis & Tato, 2001 ; Reilly &
Kelly, 2011 ). Despite some stabilisation in childhood obesity rates, the prevalence of overweight and
obesity remains high (N. C. D. R. F. Collaboration, 2017 ; Ogden et al., 2016 ). Increasing evidence ident-
iﬁes the period from conception to 2 years of age as a critical window for obesity prevention (Ander-
sen, Holst, Michaelsen, Baker, & Sorensen, 2012 ; Blake-Lamb et al., 2016 ; Woo Baidal et al., 2016 ). This
is because during the ﬁrst 2 years, children ’s feeding behaviours and preferences are shaped and
inﬂuenced by modi ﬁable parental child-feeding behaviours that lead to childhood obesity (Birch &
Ventura, 2009 ; Clark, Goyder, Bissell, Blank, & Peters, 2007 ; Woo Baidal et al., 2016 ). Initiation and

duration of breastfeeding (Yan, Liu, Zhu, Huang, & Wang, 2014 ), timing of introduction to solids
(Wang et al., 2016 ), the type and quantity of foods consumed (Johnson, van Jaarsveld, Llewellyn,
Cole, & Wardle, 2014 ; Pearce & Langley-Evans, 2013 ), and parent –child interactions during feeding,
such as responsive or controlling feeding (Birch & Doub, 2014 ; Pérez-Escamilla, Segura-Pérez, &
Lott, 2017 ), are all implicated in child weight outcomes.
Given the modi ﬁable nature of these child feeding behaviours, there is an increasing focus on
interventions targeting early child feeding to prevent childhood obesity (Redsell et al., 2016 ). Health-
care professionals are in a unique position to deliver early child feeding interventions as they engage
frequently with parents during the child ’sﬁrst two years. A number of trials have examined the e ﬀects
of such interventions delivered by healthcare professionals in early childhood (Hesketh & Campbell,2010 ; Laws et al., 2014 ). Despite the large potential for bene ﬁts (Gorin et al., 2014 ), to date healthcare
professional interventions demonstrate inconsistent or minimal eﬀ ects on weight outcomes for chil-
dren up to 5 years old (Hesketh & Campbell, 2010 ; Laws et al., 2014 ; Redsell et al., 2016 ). However, a
recent review incorporating a range of di ﬀerent early child feeding interventions, such as responsive
feeding, breastfeeding promotion and family lifestyle interventions, have highlighted improvements
in modi ﬁable parental feeding behaviours for children up to 2 years (Redsell et al., 2016 ). In light of
increasing research in this area, and the variability across trial outcomes, there is a need to identify
and synthesise the components and theoretical bases of early child feeding interventions, as these
are posited to contribute to intervention e ﬀectiveness.
Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are irreducible components of interventions that are obser-
vable, replicable and designed to inﬂ uence behaviour (Michie et al., 2013a ; Michie et al., 2013b ). Iden-
tifying BCTs in early feeding and childhood obesity prevention interventions facilitates replication of
positive e ﬀects (Martin, Chater, & Lorencatto, 2013 ) and informs the development of more e ﬀective
interventions for the prevention of childhood obesity (Michie et al., 2013a ). To date, only a limited
number of studies have examined BCTs in childhood obesity treatment or prevention. One reviewexamining BCTs in the prevention and management of childhood obesity, found little evidence sup-porting the use of speci ﬁc BCTs for improving weight outcomes (Martin et al., 2013 ). Only one BCT,
related to generalising the target behaviour to multiple settings such that it becomes part of daily life,had an e ﬀect on reducing weight outcomes (Martin et al., 2013 ). A second review of weight control
interventions for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity identi ﬁed a number of BCTs
included in e ﬀective interventions (van der Kruk, Kortekaas, Lucas, & Jager-Wittenaar, 2013 ).
These
included: providing information on links between diet, physical activity and health; information onconsequences of improved diet and physical activity; providing instruction on how to perform beha-
viours; and planning changes in social support (van der Kruk et al., 2013 ). These two reviews did not
look speci ﬁcally at interventions in children up to 2 years, however. The ﬁrst examined interventions
in children aged 2 –18 years (Martin et al., 2013 ), the second examined the 0 –12 year age range
without di ﬀerentiation between age groups (van der Kruk et al., 2013 ). The ﬁndings of these
reviews therefore lack comprehensive assessment of components in obesity prevention interven-
tions speci ﬁc to the critical window of the ﬁrst 2 years (Blake-Lamb et al., 2016 ; Woo Baidal et al.,
2016 ).
Martin et al. ( 2013 ) suggest that examining theoretically based BCT use in the area of childhood
obesity prevention is also warranted. Using theory to develop and evaluate behaviour change inter-
ventions establishes clear links between determinants or predictors of targeted behaviours and
appropriate BCTs (Bartholomew & Mullen, 2011 ; French et al., 2012b ; Michie & Prestwich, 2010 ). A
number of theories have been examined in the literature in relation to early child feeding to date.
The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is one such theory that can provide insight into feeding beha-
viours such as the early introduction of solids (Heinig et al., 2006 ; Swanson et al., 2012 ; Zhang, Shi,
Chen, Wang, & Wang, 2009 ). For instance, it may be that although the early solid introduction is
against feeding guidelines parents may still do so due to their attitudes, norms and perceived behav-ioural control about the introduction of solids. These may include not perceiving negative eﬀ ects of
early solid introduction (attitude), living in an environment where early introduction is common or at278 K. MATVIENKO-SIKAR ET AL.
least not unusual (subjective norm), and feeling that their infant is a ‘hungry baby ’or will be given
solids by other family members (perceived behavioural control). A recent Australian study observed
that maternal attitude, subjective norm and group norm predicted intentions to introduce solids at 6
months (Hamilton, Daniels, White, Murray, & Walsh, 2011 ).
Responsive feeding is a broader approach identi ﬁed as particularly important for understanding
infant feeding as it relates to child weight outcomes (Hodges, Wasser, Colgan, & Bentley, 2016 ;
Pérez-Escamilla et al., 2017 ; Shloim, Vereijken, Blundell, & Hetherington, 2017 ). Responsive feeding
emerges from responsive parenting and is characterised as consistent, appropriate and prompt
feeding interactions and responses to child hunger and satiety cues (DiSantis, Hodges, Johnson, &
Fisher, 2011 ; Hodges et al., 2013 ; Hodges et al., 2016 ). Nonresponsive feeding on the other hand
lacks reciprocity between the parent and the child and involves maladaptive feeding behaviours
including feeding the child in the absence of hunger and/or beyond their point of satiety (DiSantis
et al., 2011 ). Non-responsive feeding is posited to contribute to childhood risk of overweight and
obesity by overriding children ’s self-regulation of energy intake, leading to increased risk of over-
weight (Birch & Doub, 2014 ). Family Systems Theory (FST), or Family Process Theory, adopts a
broader systems approach, incorporating interactions of individuals with their environments. While
not intended to represent a single de ﬁned theory of behaviour, the FST provides a useful framework
for understanding infant feeding behaviours and has been used in paediatric weight management
interventions (Skelton, Buehler, Irby, & Grzywacz, 2012 ). According to FST, the family is a complex,
interacting system, with higher and lower order levels, that must be viewed as a whole. This
system is in constant interaction with the environment and operates via positive and negative feed-
back loops with the ultimate goal of maintaining stability and equilibrium within the family system
and between the system and the environment. To this end, infant feeding behaviour changes, suchas waiting until six months to introduce solids, must be acceptable to the existing rules and structures
within the system such that they do not suﬃciently upset the stability of the system. Targeting higher
order levels of the system, for instance targeting parents and grandparents in the context of infantfeeding, could therefore be successful because FST views the family as a system in which parenting
practices occur that can impact all family function, including child behavioural and health outcomes
(Ball, Mushquash, Keaschuk, Ambler, & Newton, 2017 ).
Incorporating and reporting theoretical underpinnings in paediatric obesity prevention is there-
fore essential to understanding behaviours and behaviour change, and designing eﬀ ective interven-
tions (Skelton et al., 2012 ). However, reviews of obesity prevention and management interventions
with children from 2 years old up to school-aged demonstrated that less than half of studies reported
a theoretical basis (Amini, Djazayery, Majdzadeh, Taghdisi, & Jazayeri, 2015 ; Knowlden & Sharma,
2012 ; Ling, Robbins, & Wen, 2016 ; Skelton et al., 2012 ; Thomas, 2006 ). The majority of studies in
reviews that examine theory reported using social cognitive theory (Amini et al., 2015 ; Knowlden
& Sharma, 2012 ; Ling et al., 2016 ; Thomas, 2006 ), suggesting that a limited number of theories are
applied to intervention development in this area. Two reviews of younger children, including one
review speci ﬁcally examining weight reduction interventions in children aged 0 –2years (Redsell
et al., 2016 ), also noted poor theory reporting and a focus on social cognitive theories where theories
are reported (Hesketh & Campbell, 2010 ; Redsell et al., 2016 ). These reviews did not systematically
examine the use of theory in intervention development, however, and did not examine potential
links between theory use and BCTs.
The aim of this study is to identify BCTs and theory use in healthcare professional-delivered early
child
feeding interventions to prevent obesity for children ≤2 years.
Methods
This review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (See Supplementary File 1). The current review was conducted aspart of a complementary review of the e ﬀectiveness of healthcare professional delivered earlyHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 279
feeding interventions to prevent childhood obesity (Matvienko-Sikar, Toomey et al., 2017 ) (PROSPERO
registration number: CRD42016033492). The same systematic literature search was conducted for
both reviews, with the exception of the inclusion of the methodological term ‘time series ’in the
current review; data extraction and synthesis was conducted separately for each review.
Systematic literature search
The following databases were searched from inception to January 2019: CINAHL, the CochraneLibrary, EMBASE, Medline and PubMed, PsycINFO, and Maternity and Infant Care. Searches also
included additional sources, such as trial registries including clinicaltrials.gov, contact with
authors of relevant publications, and reference list searching by one researcher (LD). Searchterms used are presented in Supplementary File 2. Eligibility criteria were: (1) interventions pro-
moting healthy feeding practices and behaviours to prevent overweight and obesity delivered
by a healthcare professional (de ﬁned as someone who has undergone professional training to
provide any form of health care); (2) children, born at >38 weeks gestation, and ≤2 years at inter-
vention commencement; (3) examination of at least one feeding outcome; (4) inclusion of anactive or ‘normal care ’comparator. Studies were excluded if they only included breastfeeding out-
comes as the focus of this review is on broader infant feeding practices, including complementary
feeding, up to two years of age. Randomised controlled trials (including cluster randomised con-
trolled trials), case –control, and quasi-experimental studies were included. There were no restric-
tions on country or date of publication. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of studies were
independently screened by at least two researchers (KMS, LD, CF); any disagreements were
resolved by consensus.
Data extraction
A standardised form was used by two researchers (KMS, LD) to extract relevant study characteristics
(see Supplementary File 3). Where more than one study is published from the same trial, results are
presented for the overall trial, including all relevant individual papers.
Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) coding . Only BCTs related speci ﬁcally to child feeding beha-
viours were coded. BCTs were coded from intervention descriptions using the Behaviour ChangeTechnique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) (Michie et al., 2013b ). The BCTTv1 includes 93 distinct
BCTs, grouped into 16 clusters that are used to specify detailed content of behaviour change inter-
ventions (Michie et al., 2013a ). Intervention content was coded for presence (+) or absence (-) of the
BCTs. As per guidance on the use of the BCTTv1, where it was unclear whether a BCT was present or
absent, it was coded as absent (Michie et al., 2013a ). Active control conditions were also coded for
BCTs; usual care conditions were not coded as components of these conditions are not developedto modify the target behaviour. Published manuscripts of trial outcomes and, where available, inter-vention protocols were examined for intervention details. All intervention content was independently
assessed by at least two reviewers, who have training and experience in BCT coding (KMS, ET, CF). Any
disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus, and through consultation with an expertin behaviour change techniques (FL) where necessary.
Theory coding . The Theory Coding Scheme (Michie & Prestwich, 2010 ) was used to describe the
theoretical basis of the reviewed interventions. This coding scheme is comprised of 19 items thatdescribe, for instance, whether a theory or model is mentioned, and how theories are incorporated
into intervention design and evaluations. The de ﬁnition of a theory or model used by this scheme is
that it represents an interrelated set of propositions or constructs that specify relationships among
variables to explain events in a systematic way (Prestwich et al., 2014 ). Items 1 –12 were coded for
in the current review to examine the extent to which the development and evaluation of the inter-vention was theoretically based. Items 13– 19 assess methodological issues related to measurement,
testing and re ﬁnement of theory. Due to the focus of this review on the use of theory in intervention280 K. MATVIENKO-SIKAR ET AL.
development, these items were not coded (MacDonald, Lorimer, Knussen, & Flowers, 2016 ). Theoreti-
cal components were independently coded from intervention descriptions in published manuscripts
and protocols by one reviewer (KMS), with a random third of all interventions coded by a second
reviewer (ET or CF). Any disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. Theoretical com-
ponents were coded for presence (+) or absence (-). Three composite scores were calculated to evalu-ate overall theory use and also relationships between theory and BCTs. The ﬁrst assessed the extent
that each BCT reported was linked to a theory-relevant construct by the authors ( ‘BCT→theory-rel-
evant construct score ’). The second composite score assessed the extent that theoretical constructs
were described by authors as speci ﬁcally targeted by BCTs ( ‘theory-relevant constructs →BCTs ’). An
overall theory score was calculated by summing individual items related to the use of theory todevelop the intervention (items 3 –6) and the two previous composite scores; this results in a score
ranging from 0 (no theory use) to 8 (most extensive theory use). Calculation of composite scores
was done following guidelines from Michie and Prestwich ( 2010 ).
Data synthesis
To examine the use of BCTs in interventions, the percentage of individual BCTs across all trials and the
total number of BCTs per intervention were calculated. To examine the extent of theory use in inter-
vention development and evaluation, the percentage of individual theory components across all
trials and percentage of theory components included per intervention were also calculated. As inter-vention e ﬀectiveness is not the main focus of this review, e ﬀects of interventions are presented in
table format and brie ﬂy narratively summarised for parent feeding outcomes (including for
example, parent feeding styles and behaviours), dietary intake outcomes (including for example,introduction of solids and frequency of food consumption), and child weight outcomes. Intervention
eﬀects are presented in terms of e ﬀect sizes where reported and/or as calculated from data presented
within the reviewed papers. A meta-analysis was not conducted for intervention eﬀ ectiveness within
this or the complementary e ﬀectiveness review (Matvienko-Sikar, Toomey et al., 2017 ), due to the
considerable heterogeneity in outcomes examined and interventions used. Attempting to collapse
multiple irreconcilable behaviours and constructs, from a small number of trials, into categories forinclusion in a meta-analysis would also not provide robust, reliable or useful insight into intervention
eﬀects or add value to knowledge in this area.
Quality assessment was independently conducted for each study by at least two researchers (KMS,
LD) using the Cochrane Eﬀ ective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) risk of bias criteria (Higgins
& Green, 2011 ). Risk of bias is presented by a trial where appropriate and in instances where multiple
studies are published from a trial, or no protocol is available for a trial, selective reporting rating is
based on an agreement between methods and results sections of included papers (see Supplemen-
tary File 4).
Results
The systematic literature search identi ﬁed 165 potentially eligible studies. Of these, 21 studies (repre-
senting 12 trials) met inclusion criteria (see Supplementary File 5 for search results). With the excep-
tion of one non-randomised controlled trial (Adam, Stern, & Stein, 1985 ; Wen et al., 2012 ; Wen et al.,
2015 ; Wen, Baur, Rissel, & Simpson, 2011 ) all studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT); study
and intervention characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Overall, studies demonstrate low to mod-
erate risk of bias (Supplementary File 4). Inter-rater reliability for BCT coding, using percent agree-ment, was high (80.49%). Inter-rater reliability using percent agreement was also high (93.93%) for
coding of theoretical underpinnings of interventions. Full consensus on BCT and Theory coding
was reached following discussion between the coders (KMS, ET, CF) and so consultation with athird party was not necessary.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 281

Behaviour change techniques in early child feeding interventions
In total, 19 BCTs were identi ﬁed across the 12 interventions reviewed ( Table 2 ). Descriptions of the
interventions in the reviewed papers and related protocols provided insuﬃcient evidence for the
presence of the remaining 80 BCTs in the BCTTv1. (Michie et al., 2013a ). The number of BCTs in indi-
vidual interventions ranged from 1 (Adam et al., 1985 ; Wen et al., 2011 ; Wen et al., 2012 ; Wen et al.,
2015 ) to 11 (Lakshman et al., 2018 ). The mean number of BCTs used across interventions was 5.1. The
most commonly reported BCT was ‘Instruction on how to perform the behaviour ’, in this case child
feeding; this was coded in all interventions. ‘Social support (unspeci ﬁed)’was the second most com-
monly identi ﬁed BCT; occurring in eight interventions. ‘Demonstration of the behaviour ’,‘adding
objects to the environment ’, and ‘identi ﬁcation of self as a role model ’were each used in ﬁve inter-
ventions. As noted in Table 2 , nine BCTs were only used in one intervention each.
Four trials included active control conditions (Adams et al., 2018 ; Fangupo et al., 2015 ; French et al.,
2012a ; Hohman, Paul, Birch, & Savage, 2017 ; Paul et al., 2011 ; Savage et al., 2018 ; Taylor et al., 2018 ).
Two of these trials included stand-alone active control conditions only (Adams et al., 2018 ; Hohman
et al., 2017 ; French et al., 2012a ; Savage et al., 2018 ). Two trials included both stand-alone control con-
ditions and combination control conditions that included components of the intervention and active
control conditions (Fangupo et al., 2015 ; Paul et al., 2011 ; Taylor et al., 2018 ). The number of BCTs
coded in each stand-alone active control condition were 1 (Fangupo et al., 2015 ; Hohman et al.,
2017 ; Taylor et al., 2018 ), 2 (French et al., 2012a ) and 3 BCTs (Paul et al., 2011 ). The combination
control conditions included 4 (Fangupo et al., 2015 ; Taylor et al., 2018 ) and 8 (Paul et al., 2011 )
BCTs. All BCTs identi ﬁed in the active control conditions were also included in the corresponding
intervention conditions (See Supplementary File 6).
Theoretical underpinnings of early child feeding interventions
Half of all trials explicitly stated that the intervention was based on theory. The most commonlyreported theories were social cognitive theory (SCT; the number of studies including this theory: n
= 4) and responsive feeding ( n= 4). Responsive feeding is proposed to be embedded in the theoreti-
cal framework of responsive parenting (Black & Aboud, 2011 ). As currently understood in the litera-
ture it can be conceptualised as representing set of propositions that are interrelated and specify
relationships among variables to explain events in a systematic way, thus meeting criteria for
theory categorisation in the Theory Coding Scheme (Michie & Prestwich, 2010 ). Three trials that
did not explicitly state being based on theory were described as being anticipatory guidance
based (Adam et al., 1985 ; Fangupo et al., 2015 ; French et al., 2012a ; Taylor et al., 2018 ), or reported
intervention aspects that were informed by theory (Paul et al., 2011 ). Eight trials reported that
theory, or predictors which are not explicitly linked to theory, were used to select or develop inter-vention techniques. Seven trials also reported that at least one intervention technique was explicitly
linked to at least one theory-relevant construct or predictor; and at least one theory-relevant con-struct or predictor was explicitly linked to at least one intervention technique across all trials. Fifty
percent of studies mentioned a targeted construct as a predictor of behaviour. Constructs di ﬀer
from predictors in the Theory Coding Scheme, in that the latter are not explicitly linked to theory.
No studies reported using theory to recruit participants or using theory to tailor BCTs to recipients.
The overall theory score, based on previous guidelines (Prestwich et al., 2014 ), ranged from 0
(Adam et al., 1985 ; Fangupo et al., 2015 ; French et al., 2012a ; Taylor et al., 2018 ) to 8 (Adams et al.,
2018 ; Hohman et al., 2017 ; Lakshman et al., 2018 ; Savage et al., 2018 ). Eight trials reported some
link between theory and BCTs; this was not restricted to the use of theory to select or develop
BCTs. However, the majority of these trials reported sub-optimal links between the two, as indicatedby low scores on the composite measures; see Table 3 . Only one trial included a combined control
condition described as having some theoretical underpinnings (Paul et al., 2011 ); the active
control condition in this trial was not described as having a theoretical basis (Paul et al., 2011 ).

Intervention e ﬀects
Individual parental feeding, dietary intake and weight outcomes examined across trials vary consider-
ably. Further, results reported for feeding, dietary intake and weight outcomes, are inconsistent
between trials, within trials over time, and between di ﬀerent outcomes within the same trial. As
such, and because e ﬀectiveness is not the primary focus of this review, a summary of intervention
eﬀects for parent feeding outcomes, dietary intake outcomes, and weight outcomes is presented
here. Results of intervention e ﬀects for individual outcomes are presented in Supplementary ﬁle 7
and a more detailed discussion of intervention e ﬀects is presented in the complementary review
of eﬀectiveness (Matvienko-Sikar, Toomey et al., 2017 ).
Parental feeding . Seven trials reported parental feeding outcomes (Adams et al., 2018 ; Daniels
et al., 2012 ; Daniels, Mallan, Nicholson, Meedeniya, & Magarey, 2013 ; Daniels, Mallan, Nicholson,
Thorpe, & Magarey, 2014 ; Daniels et al., 2015 ; Fangupo et al., 2015 ; French et al., 2012a ; Hohman
et al., 2017 ; Savage et al., 2018 ; Schroeder et al., 2015 ; Taylor et al., 2017 ; Wen et al., 2011 ; Wen
et al., 2012 ; Wen et al., 2015 ). French et al. ( 2012a ) found little to no e ﬀect of their intervention on
the likelihood of the child eating in the kitchen, self-feeding, or drinking from a cup at 1 year of
age, though a small-sized e ﬀect was observed for eating meals with the family. Taylor et al. ( 2018 )
reported medium-sized e ﬀects including increased likelihood of child self-feeding, and reduced like-
lihood of food fussiness and picky eating at 12 and 24 months; however, no eﬀ ect was observed for
responsive feeding. The Healthy Beginnings Trial (HBT) reported some medium-sized eﬀ ects of the
intervention for reducing the likelihood of using food as a reward at 1 and 2 years of age but not
at 3.5 or 5 years of age; medium-sized e ﬀects were also observed for reducing television use
during meals at 2 years (Wen et al., 2011 ; Wen et al., 2012 ; Wen et al., 2015 ). The Intervention
Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) trial reported mostly medium-sizedeﬀects for a range of parental feeding behaviours across the time points examined (Adams et al.,
2018 ; Hohman et al., 2017 ; Savage et al., 2018 ). Due to the number of variables examined in this
trial not all outcomes are reported here (please refer to Supplementary ﬁle 7); however examples
of bene ﬁcial
 eﬀects include medium-sized e ﬀects on reduced feeding to soothe at 8, 16, 28, 32
and 44 weeks; no e ﬀects were observed for appropriate use of bottles or sippy cups at 32 weeks
but eﬀects were small-to-medium in size at 52 weeks, with children less likely to use a bottle and
more likely to use a sippy cup (Adams et al., 2018 ; Hohman et al., 2017 ; Savage et al., 2018 ). Similarly,
the NOURISH trial reported small-sized e ﬀects at 13– 15 months, and 2, 2-5, and 5 years, for a range of
responsive and non-responsive feeding behaviours, including instrumental feeding and restriction(see Supplementary ﬁle 7 for all outcomes) (Daniels et al., 2012 ; Daniels et al., 2013 ; Daniels et al.,
2014 ; Daniels et al., 2015 ). In the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study, the intervention
demonstrated little to no e ﬀect for most outcomes at 18 months and 2 years; those outcomes
that demonstrated improvements, including less pressurised feeding, had medium-sized eﬀ ects
(Fangupo et al., 2015 ; Taylor et al., 2018 ). Schroeder et al. ( 2015 ) reported e ﬀects that were small-
to-medium sized for restriction and monitoring at 2 years of age but no eﬀ ect for pressure to eat.
Dietary intake . Eleven trials reported on child dietary intake (Adam et al., 1985 ; Adams et al., 2018 ;
Cameron et al., 2014 ; Campbell & Hesketh, 2007 ; Daniels et al., 2012 ; Daniels et al., 2013 ; Daniels et al.,
2014 ; Daniels et al., 2015 ; French et al., 2012a ; Gross et al., 2016 ; Hohman et al., 2017 ; Lakshman et al.,
2018 ; Paul et al., 2011 ; Savage et al., 2018 ; Schroeder et al., 2015 ; Taylor et al., 2018 ; Taylor et al., 2017 ;
Wen et al., 2011 ; Wen et al., 2012 ; Wen et al., 2015 ). Four trials reported bene ﬁcial eﬀects
for all dietary
intake outcome(s) examined, including reducing likelihood of introducing foods or drinks other thanbreast or formula milk at 4 months (Adam et al., 1985 ); small-sized e ﬀects were observed for reducing
the likelihood of adding tea, water, juice or cereal to the infants bottle; (Gross et al., 2016 ); reduced
likelihood of early solid introduction or giving non-core drinks, stage 1 foods, cereals as ﬁrst food, or
cow’s milk at 1 year of age (Schroeder et al., 2015 ); and medium-sized e ﬀects for reduced milk con-
sumption at 3, 4, 5 and 6 months of age (Lakshman et al., 2018 ). Findings were inconclusive for the
remaining trials. For instance, Taylor et al. ( 2018 ) reported bene ﬁcial e ﬀects for delaying theHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 287
introduction of solids but no e ﬀects for energy intake at 7, 12 or 24 months. French et al. ( 2012a )
reported a small-sized e ﬀect for increased fruit consumption at 1 year of age but no eﬀ ect for veg-
etable consumption. The HBT reported the decreased likelihood of early introduction of solids and
small-sized e ﬀects for the increased likelihood of consuming more than one portion of vegetables
per day at 6 months of age (Wen et al., 2011 ; Wen et al., 2012 ; Wen et al., 2015 ). No e ﬀects were
observed for vegetable consumption at any time or for fruit, drinks or snack consumption at 2, 3.5and 5 years (Wen et al., 2011 ; Wen et al., 2012 ; Wen et al., 2015 ). In the INSIGHT trial, there was an
increased likelihood of delaying introduction of solids and less likelihood of being fed low or
higher energy density formula than being in the formula, fruit and vegetables grouping at 9
months (Adams et al., 2018 ; Hohman et al., 2017 ; Savage et al., 2018 ). Some improvements were
observed for salty snack and vegetable consumption at 1 year of age but no eﬀ ects were reported
for exposure to non-core drinks, sweets or fruit (Adams et al., 2018 ; Hohman et al., 2017 ; Savage
et al., 2018 ). The NOURISH trial reported no e ﬀect for the timing of introduction of solids or a
range of dietary intake outcomes at 2 years of age (see Supplementary ﬁle 7), except whether the
infant ever tried vegetables, consumed fried potatoes, or ever tried non-core drinks (Daniels et al.,2012 ; Daniels et al., 2013 ; Daniels et al., 2014 ; Daniels et al., 2015 ). Finally, Paul et al. ( 2011 ) reported
better acceptance of speci ﬁc vegetables (see Supplementary ﬁle 7) but no e ﬀect for the timing of
introduction of solids.
Child weight outcomes . Nine trials reported on child weight outcomes; ﬁve of these trials reported
inconsistent results across the outcomes examined (Daniels et al., 2012 ; Daniels et al., 2013 ; Daniels
et al., 2014 ; Daniels et al., 2015 ; Fangupo et al., 2015 ; Lakshman et al., 2018 ; Schroeder et al., 2015 ;
Taylor et al., 2018 ; Wen et al., 2011 ; Wen et al., 2012 ; Wen et al., 2015 ).
Three reported no e ﬀects
of the interventions for all weight outcome(s) examined, including BMI z-score at 9 or 20 months
(Campbell & Hesketh, 2007 ; Cameron et al., 2014 ), 12 months (French et al., 2012a ; Taylor et al.,
2018 ), 24 months (Taylor et al., 2018 ), or 1, 3.5 or 5 years (French et al., 2012a ). Paul et al. ( 2011 )
reported reduced mean weight-for-length and slower weight gain at 1 year. Lakshman et al.(2018 ) reported small changes in weight from baseline at 6 months, with no eﬀ ects reported for
any other weight outcome at 6 or 12 months of age (see Supplementary ﬁle 7). The NOURISH trial
reported small-sized e ﬀects for BMI and less rapid weight gain at 13– 15 months but no e ﬀects for
any other weight outcomes at 13 –15 months, 2 years or 2 –5 years of age (see Supplementary ﬁle
7) (Daniels et al., 2012 ; Daniels et al., 2013 ; Daniels et al., 2014 ; Daniels et al., 2015 ). The POI study
reported no e ﬀect for BMI zscore at 3.5 years of age but a medium-sized eﬀ ect at 5 years of age
(Fangupo et al., 2015 ; Taylor et al., 2018 ). Finally, Schroeder et al. ( 2015 ) reported no e ﬀect for
weight, BMI or BMI zscore at 1 or 2 years of age, a small-sized eﬀ ect for triceps and subscapular skin-
fold at 1 and 2 years, and a small-sized e ﬀect for triceps skinfold at 1 year but not 2 years of age.
Discussion
This is the ﬁrst review to systematically examine BCTs and the use of theory in healthcare pro-
fessional-delivered early child feeding interventions to prevent childhood obesity in children up to2 years. The ﬁndings highlight a greater need for consideration and incorporation of BCTs and theor-
etical components in early child feeding interventions.
Overall, a small number and range of BCTs were used in healthcare professional-delivered early
child feeding interventions. The majority of interventions included the BCT ‘instruction on how to
perform the behaviour ’, which is to be expected given the importance of information provision for
parents of young children, particularly around early feeding and weaning (Arden, 2010 ; Mat-
vienko-Sikar, Kelly et al., 2017 ; Synnott et al., 2007 ; Walsh, Kearney, & Dennis, 2015 ). Such instruction
can be provided as anticipatory guidance and/or can include responsive feeding instruction. Respon-
sive feeding instruction involves teaching parents how to respond to their child ’s hunger and satiety
cues in a prompt and developmentally appropriate manner (Pérez-Escamilla et al., 2017 ). Recent
reviews have identi ﬁed that responsive feeding-based interventions demonstrate greater bene ﬁts288 K. MATVIENKO-SIKAR ET AL.
for some feeding and weight outcomes (Matvienko-Sikar, Toomey et al., 2017 ; Redsell et al., 2016 ),
thus indicating the potential for targeting instruction in this area. A review of interventions in children
aged 0 –12 years identi ﬁed potential links between aspects of behaviour instruction and social
support, and child weight outcomes (van der Kruk et al., 2013 ). While this paper cannot provide evi-
dence of similar associations, the prevalence of these BCTs in the reviewed studies suggests a needfor further research on the use of these BCTs in future early child feeding interventions. It is important
to note that the de ﬁnition of ‘social support (unspeci ﬁed)’, which was the second most commonly
described BCT in reviewed trials, is relatively broad. This potentially increases how frequently it is
coded and limiting interpretations that can be made in the current review. However, social
support has been consistently identi ﬁed as important by parents of young children (Green, Furrer,
& McAllister, 2007 ; Taraban et al., 2017 ). A number of social support-based feeding interventions
have also demonstrated improvements in child feeding outcomes in the extant literature(Mukuria, Martin, Egondi, Bingham, & Thuita, 2016 ; Scheiwe, Hardy, & Watt, 2010 ; Watt et al., 2009 ).
Further investigation of how best to establish and implement sustainable social support components
in early child feeding interventions is therefore warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms of inter-
vention e ﬀects. Di ﬀerences between the identi ﬁed BCTs in this and previous reviews (Martin et al.,
2013 ; van der Kruk et al., 2013 ) may be due to the di ﬀerent age groups examined. Previous
reviews have included children up to 12 years (van der Kruk et al., 2013 ) and 18 years (Martin
et al., 2013 ) and so may include BCTs targeting children ’s own eating behaviours rather than the
focus on parental feeding behaviours in the current review.
Observed links between theory and selection of BCTs in the reviewed studies were infrequently
and often insu ﬃciently reported. This suggests inadequate consideration of theory during interven-
tion design and development (Prestwich et al., 2014 ). Only half of the interventions reported a theor-
etical basis, with few incorporating theory into the development of the intervention or evaluation ofoutcomes. This is in keeping with previous ﬁndings of paediatric obesity prevention interventions
(Amini et al., 2015 ; Ling et al., 2016 ; Skelton et al., 2012 ; Thomas, 2006 ), and health behaviour inter-
ventions more generally (Michie & Prestwich, 2010 ; Prestwich et al., 2014 ). As noted in previous
reviews (Amini et al., 2015 ; Ling et al., 2016 ), one of the most commonly used theories across
studies in this review was SCT. SCT-based interventions that incorporate components to increase
mastery, self-e ﬃcacy and opportunities for learning have demonstrated eﬀ ective weight reduction
in older children (Ling et al., 2016 ). For parents of children up to 2 years, increasing mastery and
self-eﬃcacy
 around early child feeding could be particularly useful based on previous qualitative
ﬁndings regarding parents ’feeding self-con ﬁdence (Matvienko-Sikar, Kelly et al., 2017 ) and the
inﬂuence of beliefs about one ’s capabilities on subsequent behaviour (Michie, van Stralen, & West,
2011 ). As such, the inclusion of SCT in early feeding interventions is warranted, as is inclusion of a
responsive feeding approach. As previously noted, responsive feeding can help to ensure appropriate
child self-regulation of hunger and satiety through appropriate parental responses, and potentially
prevent the risk of childhood overweight (Birch & Doub, 2014 ; Matvienko-Sikar, Toomey et al.,
2017 ; Redsell et al., 2016 ). It is important to note, however, that while some reviewed interventions
are based on responsive feeding and social cognitive theory, the current review does not havesuﬃcient evidence to posit that either/both of these theoretical bases o ﬀers a more robust expla-
nation of how parental behaviours reduce the risk of childhood overweight. Furthermore, while inter-
ventions may include educational or informative components to increase self-e ﬃcacy and responsive
feeding, it is important that parents be provided opportunities to develop, enhance and maintain
these skills in practical ways; behavioural practice was a less common BCT in the reviewed studies
and warrants further examination in conjunction with psychological aspects such as self-e ﬃcacy.
The absence of broader ecological approaches and theoretical underpinnings such as Family
Systems Theory, in the reviewed studies is a limitation of the area. This is particularly true in terms
of understanding the immediate familial environment and the broader social norms in which early
child feeding occurs, and identifying which are important sources of inﬂ uence for parents in their
early feeding practices (Matvienko-Sikar, Toomey et al., 2017 ). In addition, the behavioural domainHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 289
and population targeted in behaviour change interventions can inﬂ uence the e ﬀectiveness of apply-
ing di ﬀerent theoretical processes (Peters, de Bruin, & Crutzen, 2015 ). As such, limitations in how
more general theories are applied in speci ﬁc contexts, such as paediatric obesity prevention, may
limit inferences that can be drawn about associations between these theories and intervention eﬀ ec-
tiveness. There is therefore a need for evaluation of the usefulness of parenting theories or theories
that map onto family processes in healthcare professional delivered interventions with children up to
2 years; such theories are lacking in the current review. These ﬁndings highlight the need for health-
care professional-delivered early child feeding interventions to incorporate and report theory in a
more rigorous way throughout intervention development.
Strengths and limitations
This paper provides a timely and systematic examination of BCTs and theory in healthcare pro-fessional delivered early-feeding interventions to prevent childhood obesity. The use of an estab-lished taxonomy and coding scheme for identi ﬁcation of BCTs and theoretical components is an
important strength of this study. It enables a robust and comprehensive approach to systematicallyidentify unique and potentially useful intervention components. However, it is important to note thatBCTs used to target constructs in such interventions may not be the best ﬁt and the use of a more
formal approach to linking BCTs and mechanisms of action is needed (Michie et al., 2016 ). Further-
more, in the reviewed studies all BCTs that were identi ﬁed in active control conditions were also
included in the corresponding interventions. This similarity between the intervention and control
conditions signi ﬁcantly limits the ability to determine if any observed intervention eﬀ ects are due
to speci ﬁc intervention components. Well-designed trials utilising appropriate intervention and
control conditions are therefore essential. The heterogeneity in constructs and behaviours examinedin the reviewed trials limited synthesis of intervention eﬀ ects in this review, impacting on our ability
to examine the role of BCTs and/or theory on intervention outcomes. Use of more standardised
approaches to evaluating outcomes of infant feeding interventions to prevent childhood obesity
(e.g., Matvienko-Sikar, Byrne et al., 2017 ) may help overcome such issues in the future. It is important
to consider the ﬁdelity of intervention delivery and receipt in terms of BCT use and theoretical under-
pinnings due to moderate levels of intervention ﬁdelity within the reviewed studies, reported else-
where (Toomey et al., 2017 ). Intervention ﬁdelity relates to the extent that an intervention is
implemented as intended (Carroll et al., 2007 ). Full reporting and understanding of what actually
occurred in the intervention and control conditions during trials is essential to draw accurate con-
clusions about the role of BCTs and theoretical components (JaKa et al., 2016 ; Toomey et al.,
2017 ). Thus, the methodological limitations of the reviewed studies must be taken into account
when examining the role of theory and BCTs in early child feeding interventions.
Conclusion
This is the ﬁrst systematic examination of BCTs and theoretical components in healthcare pro-
fessional-delivered early child feeding interventions for childhood obesity prevention for children
up to 2 years. The ﬁndings indicate that, across the reviewed studies, theory is not adequately
reported, with poor evidence of integration of theory in intervention development. Future early
child feeding interventions must be more robustly theoretically based with full consideration
given to BCT and theoretical components. Future work teasing out associations between BCTs,
theory and speci ﬁc outcomes is also a critical next step in developing and evaluating healthcare pro-
fessional-delivered early child feeding interventions.
