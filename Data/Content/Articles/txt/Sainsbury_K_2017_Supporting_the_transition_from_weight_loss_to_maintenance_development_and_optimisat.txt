ABSTRACT
After weight loss, most individuals regain lost weight. Interventions to
support the transition from successful loss to weight loss maintenance
(WLM), regardless of the method of prior weight loss, are needed. The
aims of this study were to (1) develop a face-to-face behavioural
intervention session to support overweight and obese individualswho have recently lost a clinically significant amount of weight in
the transition to WLM; (2) to assess the single-session intervention
for acceptability and feasibility prior to its use in a larger, 12-month,
multi-component trial; and (3) to optimise the intervention session
for future use based on participant feedback. Participants with aBody Mass Index of ≥25 kg/m
2prior to a ≥5% weight loss in the
previous 12 months were recruited via the local governmentauthority and community-based advertisements. Each attended the
one-hour session with a trained facilitator, which focused on setting
maintenance-relevant weight, eating, and physical activity goals.Semi-structured interviews were carried out immediately post-
session to obtain feedback on the acceptability of this intervention
component. Data were used to generate recommendations forchanges to the session, which were discussed by the team, and
used to optimise the session. Seventeen participants (13 female;
median WL = 13%) were recruited. All participants evaluated the
intervention session positively; 11 participants suggested
improvements including reducing information provision in favour ofARTICLE HISTORY

greater focus on identifying and coping with barriers, and the inclusion
of practical examples. The systematic refinement and optimisation
process resulted in an acceptable and feasible face-to-face
behavioural intervention session (described here), which will betested as part of a multi-component intervention. We anticipate the
session could be used to supplement existing support including
online services, and has the potential to benefit people who have
lost a clinically significant amount of weight to achieve WLM over
the long term.
1. Introduction
The majority of adults in the United Kingdom (UK) are overweight or obese –in 2013,
67% of men and 57% of women were classified as such (Health and Social Care Infor-
mation Centre, 2013 ). These figures are higher than most developed countries and rep-
resent the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity in Europe (Health and Social
Care Information Centre, 2013 ; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment, 2012 ). Obesity is a leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality (Adams
et al., 2006 ; Must et al., 1999 ), with overweight or obese individuals having an increased
likelihood of developing chronic, life-threatening conditions such as cancer, type-2-dia-
betes, and cardiovascular disease (Adams et al., 2006 ; Calle, Rodriguez, Walker-Thur-
mond, & Thun, 2003 ; Mokdad, Bales, Greenlund, & Mensah, 2003 ; Must et al., 1999 ;
Poirier et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, the implications of overweight/obesity reach wider
than the health of the individual, with the Department of Health reporting that thedirect costs for the UK National Health Service associated with obesity alone were esti-
mated to be £5.1 billion per year ( 2011 ). Behaviour change interventions that focus on
supporting individuals to make changes to their dietary behaviours are effective in redu-
cing weight and improving health (Dombrowski, Avenell, & Sniehotta, 2010 ; Leventhal,
Weinman, Leventhal, & Phillips, 2008 ; Tsai & Wadden, 2005 ). However, despite initial
success in terms of weight loss, most individuals regain approximately half the weightthey lost within one year, and the rest of the lost weight within three to five years
(Avenell et al., 2004 ; Curioni & Lourenco, 2005 ).
Weight loss maintenance (WLM) is defined as a process of maintaining a nominally
significant intentional weight loss accomplished by one ’s own efforts (Elfhag & Rössner,
2005 ). Specifically, weight loss of 5 –10% is deemed clinically significant (Crawford,
Jeffery, & French, 2000 ; Wing & Hill, 2001 ), as it is associated with reduced obesity-
related morbidity and mortality (Franz et al., 2007 ); and maintenance is defined as
keeping this weight off for a minimum of six months (Elfhag & Rössner, 2005 ) to one
year (Wing & Hill, 2001 ). While some health benefits might be achieved and maintained
even if weight is subsequently regained (e.g., diabetes prevention; Diabetes Prevention
Program Research Group, 2009 ), interventions that support sustained WLM are needed
to optimise the long-term effects of successful weight loss interventions (Penn et al.,
2013 ). Evidence has shown that it is possible to decrease the levels of weight regain follow-
ing initial weight loss (Simpson, Shaw, & McNamara, 2011 ; Turk et al., 2009 ). For
example, in a systematic review of 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), participantswho received extended care interventions were less likely to regain lost weight comparedto control groups (Middleton, Patidar, & Perri, 2012 ). Another systematic review of WLMHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 67
RCTs found a difference in weight regain over 12 months of 1.6 kg between participants
who had received intervention and those who had not (Dombrowski, Knittle, Avenell,
Araújo-Soares, & Sniehotta, 2014b ).
In reality, individuals attempt to lose weight using a multitude of different supported
and unsupported methods. WLM on the other hand, involves a series of complex behav-
iour and goal-related changes (i.e., from initiation to maintenance) that are often associ-
ated with the transition from an energy deficit diet to a sustainable WLM lifestyle(Sniehotta, Simpson, & Greaves, 2014 ). Combined with the finding that effective strategies
for weight loss and maintenance differ (Sciamanna et al., 2011 ), the implication of this is a
need to develop flexible WLM interventions that are applicable independently of priorweight loss method. In contrast, inducing weight loss prior to randomisation to WLM
conditions inevitably results in a more homogeneous sample than would be obtained if
the former type of participant were recruited, with the effectiveness of the WLM interven-tion therefore being closely linked to the effectiveness and suitability of the weight loss
phase. Despite this important methodological consideration, only 3 of the 45 included
studies in a WLM systematic review recruited individuals who had lost clinically signifi-cant amounts of weight on their own before the WLM intervention was offered (Dom-
browski et al., 2014b ).
Based on the clear need to fill this gap, here we describe the first step in the development
of a multi-component behavioural WLM intervention; namely, a single face-to-facesession with a trained facilitator, which was designed to be attended at the commencement
of a broader, 12-month duration WLM programme. Briefly, the NULevel intervention is a
primarily SMS-delivered, self-regulatory intervention consisting of a face-to-face session,followed by frequent text messages to prompt self-weighing (using study scales with
weights transmitted digitally to the study team) and weekly diary completion (including
achievement of eating and physical activity goals), and to deliver theory-based behaviourchange techniques (BCTs) targeting motivation, psychological resources, social support,and managing conflicting priorities, among other themes. The entire intervention has
been described elsewhere (Evans et al., 2015 ) and is being tested for effectiveness in an
RCT design with an internal pilot study and process evaluation to further establish accept-
ability and feasibility. Outside of this specific context, it is anticipated that the intervention
session could also be used as a supplement to other existing weight management pro-
grammes to aid the transition from weight loss to WLM, regardless of initial weightloss method. The aims of this study were to (1) develop the content of the face-to-face
component of the behavioural WLM intervention; (2) establish the acceptability and feasi-
bility of this novel WLM intervention component; and (3) optimise the interventionsession in line with participant feedback.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
Interventions should be based on best available evidence and theory to maximise effective-
ness and understand how and why interventions do or do not work (Bartholomew, Parcel,Kok, Gottlieb, & Fernandez, 2011 ; Craig et al., 2008 ; Hoffmann et al., 2014 ; Michie &
Abraham, 2004 ). Consistent with the recommendations of the Medical Research68 K. SAINSBURY ET AL.
Council and Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM)
frameworks for the development and evaluation of complex interventions (Craig et al.,
2008 ; Glasgow, McKay, Piette, & Reynolds, 2001 ), as well as the Template for Intervention
Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist for reporting interventions (Hoffmannet al., 2014 ), the development, piloting, and optimisation process of the intervention in
the target population is described here. Specifically, this involved the delivery of theinitial version of the intervention session to members of the target population, followedby user engagement research to elicit feedback directly after the session, and the feedback
was used to revise and optimise the intervention session for future use.
2.2. Participant recruitment procedure
Participants were recruited using two routes. First, individuals participating in a weight
loss programme funded by the local government authority were invited to participateon behalf of the study team. Second, individuals were recruited via advertisements
(posters, e-posters, or the university intranet). All individuals who contacted the research
team were provided with study information and given the opportunity to ask questionsprior to consent. Those interested in participating were screened for study inclusion cri-
teria: (i) intentional loss of at least 5% of body weight in the previous 12 months; and (ii) a
pre-weight loss Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m
2(adjusted appropriately for partici-
pants from Asian backgrounds; Jafar, Chatuverdi, & Pappas, 2006 ). Exclusion criteria
included recent weight gain due to pregnancy, and unintentional weight loss (e.g.,through illness).
Individuals meeting the inclusion criteria were posted a pre-session pack approximately
one week prior to the face-to-face intervention session. This included the participant
information sheet, a four-day food and activity diary, and a pedometer (Omron
Walking Style II, piezoelectric pedometer-Omron Healthcare Ltd. Milton Keynes, UK).Prior to attending the face-to-face intervention session, participants recorded their food
and fluid intake, portion size, and any other additional detail perceived as relevant (e.g.,
cooking methods, context) in a provided diary. In addition, participants self-monitoredtheir daily steps using the pedometer and recorded them in the diary (BCT: prompt
self-monitoring of behaviour –eating and activity). They then attended a face-to-face
session at the university campus at a convenient time (between July and September
2013). Participants were asked to bring their completed pre-session pack to the interven-
tion session.
2.3. Baseline measures
Socio-demographic and weight measures were collected at the beginning of the face-to-
face session including sex, occupation, current weight, and current height. Weight wasself-reported rather than measured objectively because the goal of this early stage of the
wider study was primarily to assess acceptability of this intervention component rather
than its effectiveness for WLM. Data were also gathered on weight management goals(i.e., to lose or to maintain weight), ideal weight, amount of weight lost in their most suc-cessful weight loss attempt (self-report), number and duration of weight loss attempts inHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 69
the past 12 months, and the weight loss strategies employed in the last attempt (see Table 1
for a list of strategies).
2.4. Intervention description
The development of the face-to-face session specifically and the broader 12-month, multi-
component intervention more generally (Evans et al., 2015 ), were informed by several
trials and systematic reviews, which together provided evidence for the relevance of
self-regulation (Dombrowski, Knittle, Avenell, Araújo-Soares, & Sniehotta, 2014a ; Dom-
browski et al., 2014b ; Teixeira et al., 2015 ), self-efficacy (Linde, Rothman, Baldwin, &
Jeffery, 2006 ; Shin et al., 2011 ; Wilson, Fabio, Hill, Wen, & Estabrooks, 2015 ), and
relapse prevention in maintenance of behaviour change generally (Kwasnicka, Dom-browski, White, & Sniehotta, 2016 ) and specifically in WLM (Latner, McLeod, O ’Brien,
& Johnston, 2013 ). The intervention content and materials were developed by a team of
registered dietitians, nutritionists, and behavioural scientists with expertise and experiencein designing and delivering weight management programmes. In addition, a patient and
public involvement panel of six adults who had experience with weight loss, and two lay
members of the trial steering committee with similar experience, were consulted in thedevelopment process. Materials were additionally informed by a publically available
resource designed for a previous weight loss RCT (Sniehotta et al., 2005 ,2011 ).
For the purposes of this study, the initial version of the face-to-face intervention session
was delivered in a single, one-on-one session by a trained facilitator (dietitian), in a
location at the university. It consisted of five main sections:
1. Setting a weight maintenance goal (BCT: goal setting –outcome): given that the full
intervention was designed to aid WLM, the primary goal was to avoid regain (i.e.,
stay at current weight), thereby safeguarding the progress that participants had
already made in losing weight. In addition to this goal (classified as the ‘green
zone ’), participants were prompted to set regain thresholds using a traffic light
system for weight maintenance (Wing, Tate, Gorin, Raynor, & Fava, 2006 )–specifying
‘yellow ’and ‘red’zones, which correspond to approximately 2.5% and 5% regain
respectively and represent weights that the participant would prefer not to exceedand would signal the need to make changes to their behaviour in order to prevent
further regain and lose any regained weight. Participants could also set a goal for
further weight loss, although it was stressed that maintenance rather than additionalweight loss was the focus of the intervention. They were then encouraged to frequently
monitor their weight following the session in order to detect weight regain (BCT:
prompt self-monitoring of behaviour; note, the facilitator did not specify the frequencyof weighing).
2. Reviewing the participant ’s weight loss history, including the strategies used to lose
weight most recently and in the past. The main purpose of this section was to boostself-efficacy (BCT: focus on their past success), as well as to encourage the continued
use of personally effective strategies where these were considered sustainable and con-
ducive to general health.
3. Reviewing the participants ’food diary and using this to prompt discussion of their
eating patterns and routines, the nutritional adequacy of the current diet (e.g., fruit70 K. SAINSBURY ET AL.

and vegetable consumption), the context of eating (social, physical, and emotional),
and any antecedents and/or consequences of eating that are counter-productive to
weight management. The facilitator then provided personalised feedback (BCT:
provide feedback on performance), tailored according to the information providedin the diary and the weight goals of each participant. In negotiation with the partici-
pant, they then agreed on a number of ways to improve their diet (BCT: goal setting
–behaviour), while also emphasising the need for maintenance of effective healthy
strategies and food choices that the participant was already using. Specific suggestions
for dietary changes were taken from three alternate plans, and participants were pro-
vided with written materials to support these choices. For the purposes of this study,the options were a calorie-controlled diet (Finer, 2001 ), the Mediterranean diet (Espo-
sito, Kastorini, Panagiotakos, & Giugliano, 2011 ), and Change4Life (a UK government
issued weight management programme; Department of Health, 2009 ). Given the
limited evidence for the effectiveness of any one dietary plan over another (Jollyet al., 2010 ), these could be replaced with other options. Indeed, the available evidence
suggests that most diet plans can be effective in achieving significant weight loss ifadherence is good (Pagoto & Appelhans, 2013 ).
4. Relapse prevention/coping planning (BCT):
a. Identifying ‘trigger foods ’(defined as foods that the participant finds difficult to
limit consumption of and therefore place them at risk of over-eating; e.g., choco-late) and generating ideas for healthier alternatives.
b. Identifying tempting situations (e.g., socialising) and generating ideas for how to
manage a healthy eating plan while continuing to engage in these situations sothat they do not lead to over-consumption.
5. Reviewing participants ’current level of physical activity (i.e., step counts and any other
activity) and comparing their activity to the UK national recommendations for adults(75 minutes of vigorous or 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week (Bull,2010 ), which equates to approximately 10,000 steps per day (National Health Service
Choices, 2014 ); BCT: provide feedback on performance).
Notes from all the tasks were recorded by the facilitator in a purposely designed study
booklet (see Supplementary File 1), which participants were given to take away with
them at the end of the session. The session concluded with the facilitator summarisingthe agreed goals to check participant understanding and to reinforce their plans forWLM.Table 1. Continued.

2.5. Post-intervention interview
Immediately following the face-to-face intervention session, a semi-structured interview
was conducted by an independent researcher. The interview followed a standardised
topic guide based on a previous acceptability and feasibility study of a behavioural inter-vention for obese participants (Dombrowski, Sniehotta, Johnston, et al., 2012 ). Specifi-
cally, participants were asked to comment on (1) the parts of the session that they likedthe best (with prompts to reflect on the weight goal-setting task, information on dietand physical activity, and the two relapse prevention tasks); (2) the structure and delivery
of the session; (3) the session materials; (4) suggestions for improvement; and (5) general
comments. The interview responses were captured using pre-specified record sheets andreal-time note taking. Interviews lasted a median of 17 minutes (inter-quartile range(IQR) = 15 –18 minutes). Participants were also asked to rate the perceived usefulness
and understanding of the session using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not useful/notunderstandable at all) to 10 (extremely useful/understandable).
2.6. Analysis
Participant socio-demographic data and quantitative acceptability ratings, as assessed in
the post-session interview, were analysed descriptively using median and IQRs. The quali-
tative data collected during the semi-structured interviews was organised into relevant cat-egories for intervention refinement –this was initially done by one team member and then
discussed in detail with another team member; any disagreements were resolved through
discussion. Pre-specified categories that were used in this process included: (1) pre-session
procedures; (2) intervention session content and procedures; and (3) intervention sessionmaterials.
The feasibility of the intervention procedures and materials were assessed by recording
and reporting face-to-face session length (timed by the intervention facilitator), assessingthe appropriateness of the intervention setting, and participant adherence to pre-session
tasks (i.e., completion of food diary, use of pedometer).
2.7. Refinement and optimisation of the face-to-face WLM intervention
The optimisation process used a sequential approach. Based on the interview data and
agreed upon categories for intervention refinement (completed by two team members),each member of the intervention development team was given the opportunity to
submit recommendations for changes to the content, delivery and structure, or materials
via email. All recommendations were collated by one team member and circulated back tothe team, and then discussed in a consensus conference. Discussions were structured
around each specific recommendation and drew on the team ’s combined expertise
across a range of disciplines, which included dietetics and human nutrition, behavioural
science, health psychology, intervention development, public health, and physical activity.
Subsequently, suggested changes that were in line with empirical evidence and deemed
feasible by the delivery team were made to the intervention session protocol in order tooptimise the content, materials, and procedures. All changes and their concomitant ratio-nales were similarly organised and recorded under the optimisation categories pre-sessionHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 73
procedures, intervention session content and procedures, and intervention session
materials.
3. Results
3.1. Participants
Seventeen participants (13 women) took part in the study. Prior to initiating weight loss,
the median BMI for the women was 33.1 kg/m2(IQR = 28.7 –38.3; weight: median =
87.1 kg; IQR = 79.2 –98.6), with nine participants classified as obese and four as over-
weight. For the men, the median BMI, prior to losing weight, was lower, at 28.6 kg/m2
(IQR = 27.2 –32.9; weight: median = 90.6 kg; IQR = 86.0 –104.2); one man was classified
as obese and three were overweight. Over the course of the preceding 12 months,median-reported weight loss for the women was 10 kg (IQR = 5.9 –15.9), which equated
to 12.4% of body weight (IQR = 7.0 –18.4). The men had lost a median of 12.8 kg (IQR
= 6.0 –14.6), equivalent to 12.7% (IQR = 6.7 –15.9).
At the time of the study, the median BMI of the women was 27.0 kg/m
2(IQR = 25.2 –
31.9; weight: median = 72.7 kg, IQR = 67.2 –80.8), with two participants in the healthy
weight range, eight overweight, and three remaining obese. For the men, the median
BMI was 25.6 kg/m2(IQR = 23.9 –28.8; weight: median = 81.0 kg, IQR = 75.3 –91.2); one
was in the healthy weight range and three remained overweight.
Recent weight loss was achieved using various methods, most commonly reducing
portion sizes ( n= 13), reducing sugar, fat, and calorie consumption (all n= 11), reducing
junk food ( n= 10), increasing fruit and vegetable consumption ( n= 13), and increasing the
level of physical activity ( n= 13).
3.2. Feasibility
The median delivery time of the intervention was 48 minutes (IQR = 45 –63 minutes); no
negative feedback was received regarding the setting of the session; all 17 participants
adhered to pre-session tasks including completing their four-day food diary and recording
their level of physical activity for the same period of time.
3.3. Acceptability
3.3.1. Perceived understanding and usefulness
Immediately following the face-to-face session, the median usefulness of the intervention
session was rated by participants as 8.5/10 (IQR = 8– 9), and the median understanding
was rated as 9.5/10 (IQR = 9 –10).
3.3.2. Feedback: immediate post-interventionThere was good agreement between the two team members who were responsible for cat-
egorisation of interview responses for intervention optimisation and refinement. Qualitat-
ive feedback after the session suggested that participants evaluated the interventioncontent and format positively. In general, participants found the content informativeand interesting. Participants appreciated the tailored dietary advice and physical activity74 K. SAINSBURY ET AL.
recommendations that were provided. They reported that this aspect of the intervention
was motivating and helpful, prompting them to focus on specific changes they needed
to make to successfully manage their weight. They also appreciated the constructive feed-back on their current behaviour (based on food diaries and step counts completed prior tothe session), reflecting that it was reassuring to know that they were making good choices a
lot of the time already. Several participants reported that the two coping planning activities
were useful in prompting them to consider specifically how they would go about imple-menting change (e.g., focusing on time management).
Regarding the format of the intervention, participants reported being satisfied; in par-
ticular mentioning the relaxed atmosphere, clear structure, and ease of understanding.Similarly, positive feedback on the materials was obtained –participants felt the materials
were attractive, well laid out, and easy to follow, and they appreciated the opportunity totake content away with them to refer back to at a later time. Several participants stated thatthe process of completing a four-day food diary was useful in drawing their attention to
their eating, and prompting change even before attending the session.
3.3.3. Proposed improvements
Whilst six participants felt that no changes were required to the intervention, the remain-ing 11 suggested some improvements, either directly or by inference. All suggestions were
considered in the intervention refinement and optimisation process. Suggestions included
that the intervention was too focused on providing information, most of which wasalready known. Instead, it was suggested to assess participants ’prior knowledge, and
have a greater emphasis on identifying the participant ’s current areas of difficulty and gen-
erating ideas to overcome these (e.g., emphasising the importance of self-regulatory andrelapse prevention strategies). One participant felt that greater acknowledgement of the‘real world ’barriers that prevent people from following their ideal weight management
plan would be useful, and suggested an explicit discussion of psychological barriers,specifically emotional eating and motivational factors.
Several participants reflected that the time allocated to discussing and choosing one of
the three alternate dietary plans (if needed) was not enough. Participants also found theconcept of ‘trigger foods ’confusing, and suggested that examples of such foods and rel-
evant replacements should be included. In addition, participants suggested that theywould appreciate additional time to discuss physical activity, including the identification
and discussion of barriers (analogous to existing discussions around diet). Another sugges-
tion was that, given the amount of material to be covered in the face-to-face session, itmight be helpful to be given a summary of the information in advance so that they
could think about this and come prepared.
Additional comments included that the introduced concepts should be talked about in
everyday language –for example referring to ‘what helps people stay on track’ rather than
‘relapse prevention ’and‘trigger foods ’. In support of the planned use of the session in the
context of a broader intervention, there was a preference for ongoing follow-up or
prompting to continue their weight management rather than just attending a one-off
session. Most participants felt that the booklet would be a useful tool to refer back to
for clarification and reminder. Finally, participants suggested that the dietary plan book-lets should be made available in an electronic format (e.g., online or via smart phone/tabletapp).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 75
3.4. Optimisation of the intervention
3.4.1. Pre-session procedures
Changes to the pre-session procedures incl uded the addition of more detailed written
information about the purpose and backgro und of the wider study, and instructions on
how to complete the four-day food diary and how to use the pedometer to count dailysteps. A detailed pre-session questionna ire was also developed in order to reduce the
time taken to elicit weight history and weight loss methods in the intervention
session, which was then used to prompt discussion. Based on feedback regarding the
desire for more focus on physical activity in the intervention and the need to acknowl-
edge common barriers to such, a volitional hel p sheet for physical activity (Armitage &
Arden, 2010) was also included in the pre-session pack. This help sheet contained a list
of barriers or ‘if’statements (e.g., if I feel tired) on one side and a list of solutions or
‘then ’statements (e.g., then I will remind mysel f that physical activity will energise
me) on the other side. The participant was encouraged to link the ‘if’and ‘then ’state-
ments that are relevant to them by drawing a line between them to generate ideas for
how to overcome barriers. This task served to both normalise the experience of encoun-
tering barriers and prompt consideration of potential solutions, which were thenreferred to in the intervention session dur i n gt h en e w l yi n c l u d e dg o a l - s e t t i n ga n d
coping planning activity for physical activity. The decision to introduce this prior toattending the face-to-face intervention s ession was based on the suggestion that it
would be helpful to know what was going to be covered in advance so that participantscould come prepared, having already thought about the issues to be discussed in
relation to their personal experiences.
3.4.2. Intervention content and procedures
The biggest change to the intervention content was the decision to place less focus on
specific dietetic content and recommendations (Section 3 of the original intervention).Consistent with the conceptual distinction between weight loss and maintenance,
whereby the main challenge of the latter is to support ongoing, active self-regulation to
enable adherence to the chosen plan, rather than the initial prescription/selection of aplan that occurs in weight loss, this was replaced with brief dietary feedback in thecontext of a goal-setting task. The three dietary options were then discussed only if a par-
ticipant indicated that they were not happy with their current diet and were open to fol-lowing a different plan, or if their current plan did not seem sustainable in the longer term(e.g., if they had lost weight using a very low calorie food replacement diet but were at the
point of needing to transition back to regular eating). Although the plans were not made
available electronically for use in the session as suggested, links to similar online dietarymaterials were subsequently included in the text messages received by intervention partici-
pants in the broader, multi-component intervention.
Additional changes to the content included:
.Reiterating the purpose and background of the wider study at the start of the face-to-
face session to present a more comprehensive rationale for linking the use of multipleself-regulation focused techniques in relation to their WLM (e.g., goal setting for behav-iour and outcome, action planning, barrier identification, and coping planning), as well76 K. SAINSBURY ET AL.
as allowing the opportunity for participants to specify their own preferences and needs
for support in this context;
.Expanding the explanation of ‘trigger foods ’and dedicating more time to exploring
potential solutions and creating coping plans to avoid/limit consumption. In addition,
a list of examples of healthy alternatives/swaps was included for a range of common
trigger foods (e.g., sweet and savoury snacks), and tempting situations (e.g., eating a
healthy snack prior to going out for a meal with friends so that they are less temptedto overeat). In addition to practical challenges, a number of emotion- and motiv-
ation-based challenges were also included and could be balanced with the practical
challenges depending on participant needs and preferences. The language and termi-nology used to explain the relapse prevention tasks, and trigger foods in particular,
was also modified so as to sound less technical.
.The addition of specific goal-setting tasks in relation to both eating and physical activity
using a combination of the SMART goal framework (Doran, 1981 ) and coping plan-
ning (Kwasnicka, Presseau, White, & Sniehotta, 2013 ). Although dietary changes had
been included in the original intervention, it was decided that more focus should beplaced on specific maintenance-relevant goal setting including the rationale for doingso specifically within the context of a maintenance intervention. The volitional help
sheet (Armitage & Arden, 2010 ) that was included in the pre-session pack was also
referred to here in order to aid participants in generating coping plans for personally
relevant barriers to physical activity.
3.4.3. Intervention materials
Changes to the materials were made in line with the changed content described above.
3.5. Description of the optimised intervention
After receiving the pre-session pack in the mail (including study information, food diary,
pedometer, and questionnaire), the optimised face-to-face intervention session begins
with the facilitator outlining the purpose and format of the intervention to the participant,and is followed by three distinct phases and a summary (see Table 1 for outline and BCTs
used in each phase). In phase one, the information provided in the pre-session question-
naire is used to briefly elicit the participants ’weight loss history and methods they have
used to lose weight during their most recent attempt, including their views on why this
attempt has been successful when previous attempts may not have been (i.e., encouraging
them to think about mechanisms) so that subsequent tasks can be tailored to their specific
support needs. The focus on past success to boost self-efficacy is retained. Participants arethen asked about their current intentions regarding their weight and prompted to set a
weight-related goal using the same traffic light system (i.e., regain thresholds or ‘yellow ’
and‘red’zones; Wing et al., 2006 ) as in the original intervention, and the rationale for fre-
quent self-monitoring of weight is provided.
The focus of phase two is on current diet and eating behaviour. The two relapse pre-
vention/coping planning activities from the initial version of the intervention (trigger
foods and tempting situations) are retained here, with some modifications as outlined pre-viously. Within these tasks, participants have the opportunity to incorporate their specificHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 77
needs and wants for support (e.g., practical, emotional, and social). Additionally, the
rationale for goal setting using a SMART goal framework (specific, measureable, achiev-
able, relevant, time-limited; Doran, 1981 ) is given to participants and they are guided
through setting two maintenance-related eating goals, including specifying how, when,and where they will achieve the goal, who could help them, and anticipating potential bar-
riers and linking these to solutions to overcome them (coping planning; Kwasnicka et al.,
2013 ). The content of these coping plans can be related to either of the previous goals or
based on any inadequacies identified in the food diary analysis. If a participant does,
however, indicate that they are not satisfied with their current diet plan or it does not
seem sustainable in the transition from active weight loss to WLM, they are offered abooklet on one of three alternatives: a Mediterranean diet (Esposito et al., 2011 ),
calorie-controlled diet (Finer, 2001 ), and Change4Life (Department of Health, 2009 ),
although any evidence-based plan could be suggested.
Phase three focuses on physical activity. First, a review of the participant ’s current level
of physical activity is undertaken (based on pedometer readings and any additional activityrecorded in the study diary), alongside a discussion about the ways in which they may liketo become more active and any barriers to achieving this. Current activity is then comparedto the national guidelines for physical activity in adults (75 minutes of vigorous or 150
minutes of moderate activity per week, equivalent to 10,000 steps per day), and the benefits
of being physically active for both health and WLM in particular are discussed. Any indi-vidual circumstances of the participant (e.g., medical risk, injuries, etc.) that may limit
activity are discussed. Following the same format as the goal-setting activity for eating
behaviour, participants are then prompted to set a SMART goal for increasing their phys-ical activity, usually in the form of a minimum step count per day. Reference is made here
to the volitional help sheet included in the pre-session pack in order to aid participants to
generate solutions to their personally identified barriers to physical activity. The face-to-face intervention session is concluded with the facilitator summarising the participant ’s
goals for weight maintenance (weight zones), eating, and physical activity plans. When
used in the context of the broader, 12-month, multi-component intervention, an introduc-
tion to the remainder of the intervention procedures is also included.
Consequent to the shift in focus away from dietetic information and in favour of greater
focus on self-regulatory techniques, the optimised session described above could be deliv-ered by a range of allied health professionals including but not limited to psychologists ordietitians, who have been trained using the session manual (see Supplementary File 2). The
flexible nature of the intervention also means that the setting and location in which it is
delivered can vary.
4. Discussion
The aim of this study was twofold: first, to test the acceptability and feasibility of a novelface-to-face intervention session, which would subsequently form part of a 12-month,multi-component intervention, to support the transition from successful weight loss to
WLM for people who are or have been overweight/obese and have lost at least 5% of
their body weight; and second, to optimise the intervention session in line with participantfeedback and expert discussion for use in both the wider trial and potentially as a standa-lone tool. Both the initial and the optimised version of the intervention draw on strategies78 K. SAINSBURY ET AL.
from self-regulation theory (Kwasnicka et al., 2016 ; Teixeira et al., 2015 ) and relapse pre-
vention theory (Latner et al., 2013 ; Marlatt & Gordon, 1985 ), and recognise the impor-
tance of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977 ) specifically for maintaining behavioural changes
(Teixeira et al., 2015 ), which currently represent the best available evidence-based strat-
egies for behaviour change in the area of WLM.
The optimised intervention session represents a tool that is applicable to varying popu-
lations of overweight and obese people, regardless of the method initially used to induce
weight loss. This is an important distinction from many previous WLM studies, as most
have included an active weight loss phase prior to concentrating on maintenance. Such pro-
grammes may therefore have incorporated some of the tasks of maintenance (e.g., switch-ing from an approach- to an avoidance-based motivation, and from an energy deficit diet to
a sustainable lifestyle) into the weight loss phase, such that people who have lost weight on
their own are restricted in their access to important skills that may help the transition fromweight loss to maintenance. By focusing explicitly on self-regulation, including goals for
both the outcome (weight) and behaviours relevant to WLM (eating and physical activity),
the current intervention session (and wider trial) fills this gap.
It is anticipated that the intervention session described here could also be used in the
form of a standalone support tool (e.g., to be delivered following successful weight loss by
any allied health professional or commercial weight loss consultant involved in the routine
care of obesity) or as a supplement to existing weight loss and WLM support programmes(e.g., add to already available programmes currently conducted primarily online or which
would typically reduce the level of support once a reasonable amount of weight has been
lost). In this way, individuals are being supported not only to lose weight initially via theabundance of already available programmes and information, but also provided with tai-
lored information and strategies for the challenging phase of maintaining weight loss. The
intervention session was found to be highly acceptable to participants and feasible todeliver, and most felt that participation over a longer period of follow-up, such as that pro-posed for the main trial, would be beneficial.
4.1. Study limitations and strengths
This study had several limitations that should be considered when interpreting its find-
ings. First, while the intervention session described here is based on best-practice guide-
lines and available theoretical, maintenance-relevant evidence for effectiveness, the
optimised version has yet to be tested for either acceptability or effectiveness in assistingpeople who have successfully lost weight to avoid regain. Given that weight regain follow-
ing successful weight loss usually occurs in the first year, for a maintenance intervention to
be deemed successful, demonstration of results needs to occur longitudinally. Research istherefore needed to test whether involvement in such an intervention, either as a standa-
lone tool, as a supplement to existing programmes, or as one component of a multi-com-
ponent intervention (Evans et al., 2015 ) does have an impact on objectively measured
weight and weight-relevant behaviours, both following the intervention and in the
longer term. This task is currently underway in a larger trial to assess the effectiveness
of an SMS-based WLM intervention, which begins with the delivery of the described opti-mised face-to-face session and is followed by 12 months of SMS support prior to follow-up(Evans et al., 2015 ).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE 79
Second, the assessment of acceptability was based on a small number of homogenous
(e.g., predominantly females) and presumably quite motivated people. Given that the
purpose of this study was to assess the acceptability of an early version of the interventionsession rather than conduct the planned subsequent full trial of effectiveness with internalpilot study to further assess feasibility and acceptability, the sample size was deemed
acceptable. Despite this, more research is required to ensure that the optimised interven-
tion is both acceptable and effective. Additional limitations include the reliance on real-time note taking rather than audio recording the post-session interviews, and the
conduct of the interviews immediately post-intervention session, which meant that par-
ticipants were not able to comment on the acceptability of the suggested techniqueswhen used outside of the session. Given that an internal pilot and process evaluation
were planned as part of the wider trial (Evans et al., 2015 ), the current interviews were,
however, deemed fit for purpose. Another limitation was the use of self-reported
weights. Based on this design choice, these findings do not provide additional evidence
for the acceptability of objective weighing, although findings from other studies would
suggest this is both acceptable and an effective technique for managing weight when com-bined with other behavioural components (Madigan et al., 2014 ; Madigan, Daley, Lewis,
Aveyard, & Jolly, 2016 ). Finally, further research is needed to test whether any positive
results can be generalised to varying populations of obese people regardless of initialweight loss method, as was intended in the development of this tool, or whether effective-ness differs according to predictable user characteristics or preferences. This should
include assessment across samples with different socioeconomic statuses to ensure that
the delivery of the intervention does not widen health inequalities that already exist inobesity.
Strengths of this study include that all aspects of the intervention development process
adhered to current guidelines for the design and evaluation, and reporting of complexbehavioural interventions (Craig et al., 2008 ; Hoffmann et al., 2014 ) and were based on
recent comprehensive reviews of evidence and theory (Dombrowski et al., 2014a ; Dom-
browski, Sniehotta, Avenell, et al., 2012 ; Teixeira et al., 2015 ). In particular, the use of
self-regulation, self-efficacy, and relapse prevention techniques is in line with thecurrent state of the evidence for the most effective components of WLM interventions
(Dombrowski et al., 2014a ,2014b ; Latner et al., 2013 ; Linde et al., 2006 ; Shin et al.,
2011 ; Teixeira et al., 2015 ; Wilson et al., 2015 ). Further, the iterative refinement process
involved a multidisciplinary collaboration to ensure that both the dietary and physicalactivity content, and the psychological and behaviour change elements of the intervention
were comprehensive and understandable. The incorporation of such expertise with userengagement also represents a strength, by ensuring that relevant behaviour change
theory, accurate and detailed nutritional and activity information, and factors that
impact participant acceptability and engagement were given equal weight in the refine-ment and optimisation of the session for future use.
4.2. Conclusions
We have described the evidence-based design, piloting, and optimisation of a novel single-
session, face-to-face intervention to support the transition from successful weight loss toWLM, regardless of prior weight loss method and which a range of allied health80 K. SAINSBURY ET AL.
professionals and others could deliver. Preliminary results for acceptability appear prom-
ising and the incorporation of user feedback into the optimised version suggests that the
tool is likely to be acceptable when used as part of the wider trial, and to go some waytowards filling the current gap in the literature –that is, to provide one form of much-
needed support to people who have lost weight to avoid regain, which could in turn poten-
tially reduce both the illness and financial burden that obesity incurs for individuals, com-
munities, and the health care system.
