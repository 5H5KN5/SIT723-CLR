ABSTRACT
Objectives: To establish which Social Cognitive Theory constructs
mediated effects of the MobileMums (MMP) program on increasedduration and frequency of moderate-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) in women with young children ( <5 years). Methods: This
secondary data analysis is from a community-based randomised
controlled trial. Over 12 weeks, intervention participants received a
minimum of 52 individually tailored text messages, one face-to-face and one telephone-delivered session with a trained behav-
ioural counsellor. Participants identified a support person who also
received 12 weeks of individually tailored text messages. Control
participants received minimal intervention contact. Data were col-
lected pre- and post-program. Five potential mediators wereassessed: barrier self-efficacy, goal setting skills, outcome expectan-
cies, perceived environmental opportunity for physical activity and
social support for physical activity. Results: Improvements in
MVPA frequency were mediated by improvements in barrier self-
efficacy, goal setting skills, outcome expectancies and perceived
social support. Improvements in MVPA duration resulting from the
MMP were mediated by improvements in women ’s barrier self-effi-
cacy and goal setting skills. Conclusions: MMP improved targeted
theoretical constructs and this led to changes in women ’sM V P A .
These findings are valuable for refinement and translation of the
MMP and for further research to create theory- and evidence-
based physical activity behaviour change programs for women
with young children.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
A key role for behavioural health researchers is to not only develop and evaluate pro-
grams to elicit meaningful behaviour change but also to identify the mechanisms of
the program that effect change. This information facilitates evidence-based program
refinement and provides evidence for program developers working with similar popu-
lation groups, in similar contexts.

MobileMums is an individually tailored 12-week physical activity program based on
Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) that is primarily delivered via mobile telephone textmessaging. The program was developed for and with women with young children
(<5 years) through an iterative process utilising theory and formative research with
the target group (Fjeldsoe, Miller, O ’Brien, & Marshall, 2012 ). Women with young chil-
dren have been consistently shown to be less active than women of the same agewithout children (Adamo, Langlois, Brett, & Colley, 2012 ; Bellows-Riecken & Rhodes,
2008 ; Berge, Larson, Bauer, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2011 ; Brown, Mishra, Lee, & Bauman,
2000 ) and women with older children (Adamo et al., 2012 ; Brown, Burton, & Rowan,
2007 ; Miller, Trost, & Brown, 2002 ; Nomaguchi & Bianchi, 2013 ). In addition to the
many health benefits of physical activity experienced in the general population
(Haskell, Blair, & Hill, 2009 ), women with young children may also benefit from lower
risk of: developing postnatal depression (Dipietro et al., 2019 ; Poyatos-Le /C19on et al.,
2017 ; Pritchett, Daley, & Jolly, 2017 ; Teychenne & York, 2013 ) and retaining excess
body weight following pregnancy (Choi, Fukuoka, & Lee, 2013 ; Dipietro et al., 2019 ;
Ferguson, Daley, & Parretti, 2019 ; Van der Pligt et al., 2013 ). Short-term increases in
moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) have been demonstrated in previ-
ous trials of physical activity interventions designed for this target group (Gilinskyet al., 2015 ; Keller et al., 2014 ; Mascarenhas, Chan, Vittinghoff, Van Blarigan, & Hecht,
2018 ; Maturi et al., 2014 ; Vincze, Rollo, Hutchesson, Callister, & Collins, 2018 ), but
reports on these trials rarely investigate how the theoretical constructs underpinningthe intervention have impacted upon physical activity outcomes (Miller et al., 2002 ;
Cramp & Brawley, 2009 ; Fahrenwald, Atwood, & Johnson, 2005 ).
Our pilot research showed that MobileMums produced short-term (mid-intervention)
increases in the frequency of self-reported MVPA (Fjeldsoe, Miller, & Marshall, 2010 )a n d
that these changes were mediated by mid-intervention improvements in the targeted
SCT constructs of self-efficacy and goal setting skills (Fjeldsoe, Miller, & Marshall, 2013 ).
Our initial MobileMums program did not elicit improvements in outcome expectancies,perceived environmental opportunity nor social support. We adapted the programbased on these preliminary findings and the improved version of MobileMums was eval-uated in a community-based randomised controlled trial. The improved version of
MobileMums led to larger effect sizes (compared to the pilot trial) on self-reported
MVPA at the end of the intervention. The larger effects were likely driven by the statis-tically significant increase in MVPA duration (minutes/week; mean change 37.9 (95% CI9.2, 66.5)) and frequency (days/week; mean change 1.6 (95% CI 0.8, 2.3)) observed inthe intervention group, and subsequent statistically significant between-group effectsfor both of these outcomes (i.e., an intervention effect of 45.4 minutes/week and
1.4 days/week) (Fjeldsoe, Miller, Graves, Barnett, & Marshall, 2015 ). Accelerometer-meas-
ured MVPA did not statistically improve as a result of the improved version ofMobileMums, but the trial was not powered to detect this difference (Fjeldsoe etal.,2015 ).
Therefore, the aim of this secondary analysis is to examine which SCT constructs
mediated the intervention effect of the improved version of the MobileMums programon increasing self-reported MVPA in women with young children. It is anticipated thatthe improved version of MobileMums will elicit positive changes in women ’s barrierPSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 969
self-efficacy and goal setting skills, as well as outcome expectancies, perceived envir-
onmental opportunity and social support for physical activity, and that these improve-
ments will mediate the changes in MVPA. This paper adds to the scarce body ofliterature investigating how physical activity interventions work in general and specific-
ally for women with young children. It is no longer enough to simply understand if
the intervention created change, we need to know how change was supported so
that future interventions can be adapted accordingly.
Methods
Reports on our formative research and iterative development processes for creatingthe MobileMums intervention (Fjeldsoe et al. 2012 ), detailed methods of the rando-
mised controlled trial (Marshall, Miller, Graves, Barnett, & Fjeldsoe, 2013 ), the primary
evaluation outcomes (Fjeldsoe et al. 2015 ), and cost-effectiveness outcomes (Burn
et al., 2015 ) are provided elsewhere.
Study design
This was a 9-month, two-arm community-based randomised controlled trial. Participants
were randomly allocated to the MobileMums intervention group or minimal contact
control group. Data were collected before the program (Time 1), immediately after the
12-week intervention (Time 2) and 6-months after the last intervention contact (Time 3).
This secondary analysis uses data from Time 1 and 2.
The trial adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for reporting randomised controlled
trials (Begg et al., 1996 ) and was registered with the Australian Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12611000481976). Ethical clearance was obtained through the Queensland
University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee (Application # 0900001407).
Participant eligibility and recruitment
Women with young children were recruited from an Australian regional communityvia one of three methods: (1) a mailed invitation (followed by a text message and
then telephone call) to women from an existing research database who had consented
to being re-contacted for research purposes; (2) an invitation sent via a community
centre ’s Facebook #group; and (3) a mailed invitation to women who had partici-
pated in a survey about their experience of maternity care (Miller, Thompson, Porter,
Armanasco, & Prosser, 2010 ) and consented to be contacted for further research.
Further details on the trial recruitment methods and the outcomes of each recruit-
ment strategy are reported elsewhere (Marshall, Miller, Graves, Barnett, &Fjeldsoe, 2015 ).
To be eligible, women: had at least one child aged five years or younger; owned a
mobile telephone; were not pregnant at the time of consent (participants remained
eligible if they fell pregnant during the 9-month trial); lived within the designated resi-
dential area (30 km radius of Caboolture, Queensland) and planned to remain there for
the next 12 months; and were able to read and understand English. Any woman who970 B. S. FJELDSOE ET AL.
had been advised not to exercise by a healthcare professional was asked to receive
clearance before participating. Once eligibility was established, women providedinformed verbal consent over the telephone.
While the primary focus of this intervention was to increase women ’s physical activ-
ity, it was also designed to support ongoing participation by widening participants ’
physical activity support network. For this reason we chose to not exclude women
who were identified as physically active during the past week as part of the screeningprocess. Women who were habitually physically active, and did not foresee any benefitof participating opted out of the study during the informed consent process (Marshallet al., 2015 ). The recruitment strategy thus mimicked how the program may be offered
under real-world circumstances where women decide to opt into a program if they
would like to increase or maintain their activity levels.
Randomisation
Participants were randomised in three strata according to their Time 1 physical activity
frequency, which was assessed using data collected during a brief screening telephone
interview from a validated (Marshall et al., 2013 ; Fjeldsoe et al., 2015 ) single item ask-
ing (on a scale from 0 to 7 days) how many days per week they ‘exercised for at least
30-minutes ’. Each participant was classified as either: not at all active (exercised 0 days
per week); somewhat active (exercised between 1 and 4 days per week) or sufficientlyactive (exercised 5 days or more per week) (Commonwealth Department of Health and
Ageing, 2005 ). Randomisation was managed by the project coordinator using three
lists created using the ‘sample ’function in the R
#software package to create random
permuted blocks of size 10 with a 1:1 allocation ratio.
MobileMums program
MobileMums comprised multiple program components, including one face-to-face par-ticipant counselling session, participant and support person text messages, one mid-program telephone counselling session, and informational and interactive writtenresources described below. Each component of MobileMums operationalised at leastone construct of the SCT (barrier self-efficacy, goal setting skills, outcome expectancies,social support and perceived environmental opportunity) into a behaviour change
technique (Fjeldsoe et al., 2013 ).Supplementary Table 1 maps how each behaviour
change technique (Michie et al., 2013 ) was targeted in the MobileMums intervention
and how these aligned with the theoretically proposed mediators of behaviour change(updated from Fjeldsoe et al., 2013 ).
Face-to-face counselling session
After completing Time 1 assessment, the MobileMums program commenced with a
face-to-face session with a trained MobileMums behavioural counsellor. The aim of
this session was to: establish rapport between the participant and their MobileMumscounsellor, collect information to tailor the text message content, and initiate thebehaviour change process. Participants were guided to: reflect on their physicalPSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 971
activity patterns (based on feedback from Time 1 physical activity assessment); identify
expected outcomes of being active; set a SMART physical activity goal and reward forreaching their goal; identify barriers to reaching their goal and strategies to overcomethem; and identify the support they required for reaching their goal and a specific per-son to be their MobileMums support person. This session occurred at a time and loca-
tion identified by the participant (usually their home).
Two tertiary educated counsellors underwent intensive training in the evidence of
why promoting MVPA was beneficial, the constructs of the SCT, effective counsellingskills (e.g. active listening), and familiarisation with issues specific to the target group.The counsellors were provided with the MobileMums Training Guide, had multipleone-on-one training sessions and engaged in role play training prior to contact with
participants. During the program, each counsellor audio-recorded three sessions
(selected at random) with permission from the participant; these recordings did notundergo fidelity analysis but were reviewed by the first author to provide counsellorswith feedback on their performance.
MobileMums text messages
Over the 12-week program, participants received a minimum of 52 individually tailoredtext messages sent by a customised, automated web-based program. Text messagetailoring was achieved by linking the automated program with a secure database ofparticipant data collected by the counsellors during the face-to-face counselling ses-sion. Participants were sent five text messages per week for the first four weeks andfour text messages per week thereafter. Weekly text messages included one ‘goal
check text ’sent each Monday asking the participant to respond (e.g. Jenny did u do all
ur planned exercise last wk? Check ur planner magnet & text me back yes or no. Jacqui-
MobileMums) . If a participant replied to this ‘goal check text ’, the program sent an
appropriate, tailored reply. Therefore, a participant could receive an additional 11 textreplies if they responded to each goal check message (total texts possible ¼63).
Text message content was tailored to each participant ’s: name, counsellor ’s name,
goal, neighbourhood, preferred reward and/or expected outcomes for reaching hergoal. In addition, where appropriate the text messages were tailored to the partici-
pant ’s youngest child ’s name and the support person ’s name and gender.
Support person text messages
The MobileMums support person who was identified by participants during their face-
to-face counselling session also received 12 weeks of individually tailored, theory-basedtext messages. Support people were sent three theory-based text messages per week
encouraging them to offer instrumental, emotional or informational support to their
MobileMum. Some of these messages were tailored to how their MobileMum participantresponded to her weekly goal check (e.g. Luke, congratulate Jenny. She met her goal last
wk. Can u help make time 4 her reward? It ’s a bubble bath. Jacqui- MobileMums ).972 B. S. FJELDSOE ET AL.
Week 6 telephone counselling session
During Week 6, participants received a telephone call from their MobileMums counsel-
lor. The aim of this session was to update the participant ’s physical activity goals and
strategies in order to refine text message content in Weeks 7 to 12.
Supplementary resources
Throughout the program participants had ongoing access to their MobileMumsParticipant Handbook, MobileMums website with searchable, on-line exercise directory,secret MobileMums Facebook
#group (which research staff monitored), MobileMums
Goal Tracking refrigerator magnet, and information brochures, all of which theyreceived during the initial face-to-face counselling session.
Changes from the pilot version of MobileMums (Fjeldsoe et al., 2010 ) in developing
the version of the program tested here included: a more active, online process torecruit the MobileMums support person; higher dose of texts to the support person (3texts/week rather than 2 texts/week); more tailoring of the support person texts; par-ticipant access to a MobileMums Facebook
#group and an on-line exercise directory;
higher dose of texts to the participants in Weeks 5 –12 (4 texts/week rather than drop-
ping to 3 texts/week); and the initial consult being guided by the MobileMumsParticipant Handbook which was kept by the client.
Control group
Women in the minimal contact control group received the same standard physicalactivity information brochures as the intervention group and had access to a separateinformation-only website and a separate non-moderated Facebook #group. This treat-
ment was designed to reflect the minimal care that service providers could feasibly
deliver without specific funding (e.g., standard print materials, non-moderatedFacebook #access).
Data collection
Data were collected via self-administered postal questionnaire and telephone interview
at Time 1 and 2. The telephone interviews were conducted by trained research assis-tants who may not have been blinded to group allocation at Time 2 due to partici-pants disclosing information about their treatment. All participants received a nominalgratuity ($20 gift voucher) for each completed assessment to recognise their contribu-tion to the research.
Physical activity outcomes
The Australian Women ’s Activity Survey was developed to specifically assess phys-
ical activity among women with young children (Fjeldsoe, Miller, & Marshall, 2009 )
and was administered during the telephone interview at Time 1 and 2. This surveyasks respondents to recall the frequency (days/wk) and duration (time/day) of avariety of activities during weekdays and weekend days, with a recall referencePSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 973
period of a typical week in the past month. It assesses women ’s activity across five
domains (planned, transport, childcare, domestic and work-related) and threeintensity levels (light, brisk walking, other moderate and vigorous). The interview-administered Australian Women ’s Activity Survey has good test-retest reliability
and acceptable criterion validity (compared to accelerometer data) (Fjeldsoe et al.,
2009 ). The key variables calculated from the survey were: minutes per week (dur-
ation) and days per week (frequency) in the planned and transport domains forMVPA (including brisk walking, moderate and vigorous intensity activities).
Potential mediator outcomes
These outcomes were assessed via self-administered questionnaire, in both groups, at
Time 1 and 2.
Physical activity barrier self-efficacy was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1
‘not at all confident ’to 5 ‘very confident ’), using a 12-item tool adapted from a previ-
ous scale (Marcus & Owen, 1992 ). Our version included two additional items for
women with young children (i.e. I can exercise even when: ‘I don ’t have anyone to
look after the kids ’;‘I have housework to do ’). This adapted version of the scale has
demonstrated sensitivity to change among postnatal women (Miller et al., 2002 ;2013 )
and acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachs a¼0.71) (Fjeldsoe et al., 2013 ).
Goal setting skills were measured using the 10-item Exercise Goal-setting Scale
(Rovniak, Anderson, Winett, & Stephens, 2002 ). This scale has good test retest reliabil-
ity (r¼0.87) over an 8-week period (Rovniak et al., 2002 ). The Exercise Goal-setting
Scale items assess setting goals (e.g. I often set exercise goals), self-monitoring (e.g. Iusually keep track of my progress in meeting my goals) and problem solving (e.g. If I
do not reach my goals, I analyse what went wrong). Each item was measured on a 5-
point Likert scale, but following our formative research the original anchors ( ‘does not
describe ’to‘describes completely ’) were adapted to ‘strongly disagree ’to‘strongly
agree ’. The adapted version of the Exercise Goal-setting Scale had good internal con-
sistency (Cronbachs a¼0.84) (Authors, 2013 ), similar to that of the original scale
(r¼0.89) (Rovniak et al., 2002 ).
Outcome expectancy was measured using 10-item scale developed by Rodgers and
Brawley ( 1991 ). Participants rated outcome likelihood (on an 11-point scale,
0%–100% likelihood) and outcome value (on a 9-point scale of importance) for seven
physical activity outcomes. Ratings were multiplied to indicate overall outcomeexpectancy (range 0 –900). Consistent with the creator ’s recommendations, the spe-
cific physical activity outcomes used in this study were determined from formativeresearch with the target population. The most commonly reported positive (weightloss, improved fitness, more energy, less stress, improved mental well-being) andnegative outcomes (injury, lost time to do other things) were included. Our previous
trial (Fjeldsoe et al., 2013 ) and others (Cramp & Brawley, 2009 )h a v ed e m o n s t r a t e d
that the measure was sensitive to change in a physical activity intervention among
women with young children. The scale had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachsa¼0.72) (Fjeldsoe et al., 2013 ).974 B. S. FJELDSOE ET AL.
Perceived environmental opportunity for physical activity was measured using 12
items designed and implemented by Hoehner and colleagues (Hoehner, Brennan
Ramirez, Elliott, Handy, & Brownson, 2005 ). These items were derived from a review of
three commonly used questionnaires to assess environmental impact on physical
activity participation (Brownson et al., 2004 ), and assessed on a five point Likert scale
from 1 ‘strongly disagree ’to 5 ‘strongly agree ’. Based on our formative research we
added two additional items to the scale ( ‘There are footpaths wide enough to fit
prams in my neighbourhood ’and ‘Unattended dogs make it unsafe to walk in my
neighbourhood ’). The adapted scale has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachs
a¼0.75) (Fjeldsoe et al., 2013 ).
Physical activity social support from the participant ’s partner (husband or defacto)
and from their family or friends was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale using the Social
Support for Exercise Scale (Sallis, Grossman, Pinski, Patterson, & Nader, 1987 ). Five
items, including an additional one ( ‘offered to mind the kids so I could be more phys-
ically active ’) were assessed on a scale from 1 ‘never ’to 5 ‘very often ’. The original
scale has good test-retest reliability ( r¼0.55–0.79)(Sallis et al., 1987 ) and this slightly
modified version has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbachs a¼0.90)
(Fjeldsoe, Miller, & Marshall, 2013 ) and sensitivity to change among women with
young children (Fjeldsoe et al., 2002 ,2013 ). Participants nominated which scale (i.e.
partner; family and friends) should be used to represent the support provided by theirMobileMums support person.
Sample size
Sample size was based on the clinically meaningful increase in self-reported MVPAobserved in our pilot study at mid-intervention (40 minutes/week) (Fjeldsoe et al.,
2010 ). Using the standard deviation of 102 minutes/week (from survey data), and
assuming 80% power and two-sided significance of 5% we needed 102 women per
group. Anticipating a 25% dropout, this figure was inflated to 128 per group (256 in
total). We were not powered apriori to examine mediators. As such, our interpretationof findings accounted for both the statistical significance and the magnitude
of effects.
Statistical analysis
Self-reported MVPA variables and mediator variables were converted to change scores bysubtracting Time 1 from Time 2 scores. Mediator variables were also standardised by divid-
ing each score by the standard deviation of the change score, to allow for more meaning-
ful interpretation of unstandardised regression coefficients. Change and standardised
change variables sufficiently met the assumptions of normality, independence andhomoscedasticity.
Mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS tool for SPSS (Hayes, 2013 ).
PROCESS uses ordinary least squares regression to compute coefficients for pathways
a,b,cand c
0(see Figure 1 for a description of each path), in addition to providing
bootstrapped confidence intervals for evaluating the indirect effect. BootstrappingPSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 975
techniques, rather than Sobel tests (as stated in our trial protocol (Marshall et al.,
2013 )), were used to quantify the indirect effect. Bootstrapping is now widely regarded
as a superior method as it does not make assumptions about the normality of thesampling distribution of the indirect effect, which is often asymmetric (Hayes, 2009 ).
Using Model 4 in PROCESS (Hayes, 2013 ), which allows for the calculation of simple
mediation with the inclusion of covariates, analyses were conducted separately for
each mediator and each self-reported MVPA outcome (i.e. a single mediator and out-come measure in each analysis). Time 1 scores for the mediator and self-reportedMVPA outcome were entered as covariates in each of the respective analyses. Square-
root transformations were used for two of the Time 1 variables (i.e. social support
from family and friends, MVPA duration) entered as covariates to correct for violationsof the assumption of normality. Estimates of the 95% bias-corrected confidence inter-vals of the indirect effect were derived from 5000 bootstrap samples. Due to smallamounts of missing data, analyses were conducted among women who had complete
data for the corresponding variables rather than excluding women with incomplete
data from all analyses. Analyses were conducted with SPSS version 21.
Results
Participants
Three-hundred and six participants consented, and 263 (86%) completed Time 1
assessments and were randomised. The retention rate of the randomised sample was
86% at Time 2 ( n¼226; end-of-intervention), but this retention rate was significantly
different for the intervention group (82%) compared to the control group (90%) (oddsratio (OR) ¼2.49, p¼.06, 95% CI [1.01, 6.72]). This difference in retention rates was
likely due to the higher contact burden for the intervention including repeated con-
tact that provided more opportunity for intervention participants to withdraw. Kruskal-
Wallis tests revealed no significant differences in demographic characteristics forwomen with and without complete data at Time 2. The mean age of the trial sampleFigure 1. Conceptual model of the proposed simple mediation analyses.

Mediators of intervention effects on self-reported MVPA frequency
The MobileMums program led to significant increases in barrier self-efficacy, goal set-
ting skills, and social support from family and friends, from partners and fromMobileMums support persons ( Table 2 ;apaths). Increases in barrier self-efficacy ( p<
.001), goal setting skills ( p¼.001), outcome expectancy ( p¼.005), perceived environ-
mental opportunity ( p¼.042) and social support from family and friends ( p¼.050),
and from partners ( p¼.025) were related to improved frequency of self-reported
MVPA ( Table 2 ;bpaths). The association between group allocation and increased fre-
quency of self-reported MVPA was mediated by improved barrier self-efficacy
(ab¼0.48, 95% CI ¼0.18–0.97), goal setting skills ( ab¼0.74, 95% CI ¼0.26–1.44), out-
come expectancy ( ab¼0.20, 95% CI ¼0.01–0.52), social support from family and
friends ( ab¼0.33, 95% CI ¼0.01–0.83) and social support from partners ( ab¼0.50,
95% CI ¼0.14–1.05; Table 2 ).Table 1. Demographic and physical activity characteristics of participants randomly allocated to

Mediators of intervention effects on self-reported MVPA duration
The MobileMums program led to significant improvements in barrier self-efficacy, goal
setting skills and social support from family and friends, from partners and fromMobileMums support persons ( Table 3 ;apaths). Improvements in barrier self-efficacy
(p¼.007) and goal setting skills ( p¼.035) were associated with increased self-
reported MVPA duration ( Table 3 ;bpaths). The association between group allocation
and increases in self-reported MVPA duration was mediated by improvements in bar-rier self-efficacy ( ab¼15.53, 95% CI ¼3.40–36.08) and goal setting skills ( ab¼22.24,
95% CI ¼1.90–49.61; Table 3 ).
Discussion
This secondary analysis of MobileMums trial data showed that the improvements
observed in self-reported MVPA frequency were mediated by improvements in wom-en’s barrier self-efficacy, goal setting skills, outcome expectancies and perceived social
support, while improvements in self-reported MVPA duration were mediated by
improvements in barrier self-efficacy and goal setting skills. Changes in perceived
environmental opportunities did not mediate the intervention effects on MVPA fre-quency or duration.
These findings align with those from earlier mediational analyses of physical activity
interventions among women with young children (Miller et al., 2002 ; Cramp &
Brawley, 2009 ; Fahrenwald et al., 2005 ) and also complement and extend the findings
of our pilot MobileMums study (Fjeldsoe et al., 2013 ). Both versions of MobileMums
significantly improved women ’s barrier self-efficacy, goal setting skills and social sup-
port (i.e. Path afindings). In the pilot study mediation was only significant at mid-
intervention (not end of intervention), while the current trial demonstrated significantmediators of end of intervention effects. This suggests increased longevity of the
improved program ’s impact on targeted mediators beyond the first six weeks. These
analyses also revealed another step-wise improvement from the pilot version ofMobileMums whereby improvements in outcome expectancies and perceived socialsupport were detected as mediators, when they were not in the pilot trial. Iterativeimprovements made to the program specifically targeted these theoretical constructsTable 3. Coefficients and standard error (SE) or 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the

and these findings thus reaffirm the benefits of an iterative approach to program
development that accounts for progressive learnings.
This improved version of the MobileMums program did not elicit changes in per-
ceived environmental opportunity. Based on similar findings in the pilot trial, weadded the on-line, searchable exercise directory to this version of MobileMums andmade more frequent reference to local opportunities for exercise in the tailoredtext messages. However, our process evaluation showed that women did notengage with the online directory (Fjeldsoe et al., 2010 ) ,w h i c hm a ye x p l a i nt h el a c k
of impact on this construct of the SCT. It is also possible that the actual environ-ment (as opposed to the perceived environment) in which women were living wasunsupportive for women to be active with young children, thus limiting the poten-tial for improving women ’s perceptions. We did not collect data on the actual
opportunities present in participant ’s neighbourhoods in this trial. It is also possible
that improving women ’s perception of environmental opportunities takes longer
than 12 weeks and that repeat exposure and attempts to access environmentalopportunities in many different contexts are required to elicit changes in this con-struct. Finally, there is some cross-sectional evidence to suggest that the associ-
ation between women ’s perceived opportunity for physical activity and leisure-time
physical activity is attenuated by their psychological and social factors, particularlyfor women with medium or high psycho-social support (Cleland, Ball, & Crawford,2013 ). This may explain the lack of findings for perceived environmental opportun-
ity in this trial. Future research needs to examine how women ’s perceptions of their
environment shape their physical activity behaviours, is attenuated by their psycho-logical and/or social influences and how this may be shifted over time.
There were no consistent patterns of the mediation effects of social support on
physical activity across the three sources assessed (i.e. family and friends, partner,nominated MobileMums support person). The program may have improved women ’s
skill in obtaining social support from multiple sources, outside of their directMobileMums support person, and this diversity of support sources may have dilutedthe findings.
Two reviews in the past decade have summarised the evidence on mediators of
physical activity behaviour change, one among non-clinical adults (Rhodes &
Pfaeffli, 2010 ) and one in overweight or obese adults (Teixeira et al., 2015 ). Both
reviews suggested that self-regulation consistently and significantly mediatedchanges in physical activity. Teixeira and colleagues (2015) also found that highautonomous motivation and self-efficacy frequently mediated changes in physicalactivity in overweight or obese adults. Importantly, both reviews caution that thereremains a relatively small number of mediational studies, and those availableemploy poor quality methodology. Few physical activity interventions designed forwomen with young children have evaluated the mediators of change (Miller et al.,2002 ;C r a m p&B r a w l e y , 2009 ;F a h r e n w a l de ta l . , 2005 ). Generally, those that have
evaluated mediators have reported findings consistent with the current trial, in thatbarrier self-efficacy, social support for physical activity (Miller et al., 2002 )a n ds e l f -
regulatory efficacy (Cramp & Brawley, 2009 ) act as mediators of increased phys-
ical activity.PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH 979
This trial was not powered appropriately to detect mediational effects. The lack of statis-
tical power increases risk of Type II errors in our interpretation of the analyses. Notably, therewere different mediators of intervention effects for MVPA frequency and duration outcomes,w h i c hm a yb eas p u r i o u sf i n d i n gd u et oT y p eIe r r o ra n dt h em u l t i p l ec o m p a r i s o n sm a d ei nthis secondary analysis. Multiple mediator models were not used in this analysis due to thesmall sample. This limits the theoretical conclusions that can be drawn because the SCT prin-ciple of reciprocal determinism suggests that the proposed mediators interact to impact onbehaviour. Physical activity was assessed via self-report measures in this secondary analysis.In comparison to objective measures, self-reported physical activity may be over-reported
due to recall inaccuracy or social desirability bias, or under-reported due to the constraints
of questions asked (Prince et al., 2008 ). However, we used the Australian Women ’s Activity
Survey to assess physical activity, which was specifically designed to minimise reportingbiases by encouraging women to report all of their activities. Finally, the sample of womenrecruited into this trial may not have been representative of the broader community ofwomen from which it was sampled.
In an era of increased focus on intervention content and design reporting it is concern-
ing to note the ongoing lack of mediator evaluations in the literature. There has been a
surge in reviews of publications reporting on the behaviour change techniques used in
effective behaviour change interventions (Michie, West, Sheals, & Godinho, 2018 ). These
evidence syntheses are informative, but the mere presence or absence of a behaviourchange technique in an intervention design does not speak to its causal impact on the tar-geted behaviour, as is illustrated through a mediational analysis. The findings of this ana-lysis have helped the authors to refine MobileMums and inform the ‘active ingredients ’to
maintain in adapting the program for wide-scale dissemination. This paper also adds valu-able knowledge for researchers and practitioners striving to create evidence-based physicalactivity behaviour change programs for women with young children.
