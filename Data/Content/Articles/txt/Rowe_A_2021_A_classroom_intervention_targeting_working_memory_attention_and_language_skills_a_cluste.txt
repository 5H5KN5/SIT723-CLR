memory, attention and language skills: a
cluster randomised feasibility trial

Abstract
Background: International debate around the best models of speech and language therapy provision for children
with language disorders has highlighted the need for research into classroom-based approaches and intervention
dosage. Working memory (WM) is a cognitive skill linked to attention and language. ‘Recall to Enhance Children ’s
Attention, Language and Learning ’(RECALL) is a novel, 6-week, classroom-based intervention delivered by health
professionals (HPs) and teachers. It is designed to target WM and enhance attention and language skills in 4 –5 year
olds.
Methods: A cluster randomised feasibility trial was conducted to investigate aspects of the feasibility of a definitive
trial to evaluate RECALL: (i) recruitment and sampling procedures; (ii) compliance and fidelity; (iii) the acceptability
of RECALL to HPs and teachers; (iv) the appropriateness of the outcome measures. Six classes of 4 –5 year olds
participated: two received RECALL, two received an existing intervention targeting attention skills (not underpinned
by WM theory), and two received education as usual (no intervention). Ten children in each class ( n=60) were
sampled to assess the appropriateness of the outcome measures. Classroom observations were conducted to
measure fidelity and semi-structured interviews with HPs, and teachers explored the acceptability of RECALL.
Results: The recruitment targets were met, and all six schools completed the trial, but the sampling procedures
require modification. Compliance was good (95% of RECALL sessions were delivered), but fidelity to the
intervention protocol varied between 76% and 45% across the two schools. This was influenced by large class sizes,
child factors, and facilitator factors, e.g., their understanding of the theory underpinning the intervention. The lack
of fidelity reduced the dose (number of practice items) accessed by individual children, particularly those most at
risk. There were mixed findings regarding the acceptability of RECALL and the appropriateness of the outcome
measures.
Conclusions: The trial protocol could be easily scaled-up in a future definitive trial, with an amended sampling
procedure. RECALL should be repackaged as a small group intervention to enhance the fidelity of its delivery and
its acceptability to HPs and teachers. This study highlights the need for thorough training for professionals who
deliver classroom-based interventions for children with language disorders.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15This study addressed the acceptability of a novel
intervention for children with language disorders
and the feasibility of delivering it to whole classes of
4–5-year-old children.
/C15The fidelity of the intervention delivery was
compromised by large class sizes, child factors and
facilitator factors, which could ultimately reduce the
dose and potency of the intervention.
/C15The fidelity of the intervention delivery could be
optimised if it were repackaged as a small group
intervention, supported by direct training for the
professionals who would deliver it in the classroom.
Background
The use of classroom-based interventions
Worldwide, there has been debate around the best
models of Speech and Language Therapy (SLT)
provision for school-aged children who are at risk of lan-
guage disorders, particularly those from areas of social
disadvantage (SD) where high proportions of children
present with impoverished language skills on school
entry [ 1,2]. SLT services are increasingly providing col-
laborative, classroom-based interventions, but there is a
lack of research-based evidence for this approach [ 3].
This raises important questions about whether valuable
and limited resources are being used in the most effi-
cient way [ 3–5]. Due to the role SLTs have in early
intervention and prevention for language disorders, there
is a need for ecologically valid research (conducted in
real-life contexts) to provide an evidence-based practice
approach [ 6,7].
Context of the current study
The current study was conducted in the real-life context
of health and education services in one region of the
UK, Northern Ireland (NI), where there are high rates of
SD associated with educational underachievement [ 8,9].
Extending the role of health professionals (HPs) within
early intervention and integrated service provision across
the health and education sectors is a key strategy [ 10]
that aims to harness HPs' specialist knowledge of the de-
velopmental skills that form the foundation for learning
(e.g., language and motor skills) to enhance educational
practice. The Regional Integrated Support for Education
(RISE) teams are based in five Health and Social Care
Trusts (HSCTs) that provide integrated health and social
care services across NI. The RISE teams include speech
and language therapists (SLTs), occupational therapists
(OTs), physiotherapists (PTs) and social, emotional and
behavioural specialists (SEBs). They provide individua-
lised (specialist) support for children referred by their
teachers and whole class (targeted and universal)interventions that aim to prevent potential future diffi-
culties for at risk children (i.e., non-referred children)
[3]. The teams work in a transdisciplinary model in
which professionals jointly plan and deliver interven-
tions. Within the classroom context, this also involves
teachers and classroom assistants. Overall, this approach
aims to maximise clinical and cost effectiveness by en-
hancing the holistic nature of interventions and stream-
line the clinical pathway for children by professionals
sharing their expertise [ 11].
In NI, children commence formal education at 4 years
of age, and the mainstream school population includes a
wide range of children including those with undiagnosed
and diagnosed intellectual and/or developmental difficul-
ties. The majority of children referred to the RISE teams
are 4 –5 year olds from schools in areas of SD. Attention
and language difficulties are most frequently cited as the
reason for referral [ 12]. Current support, developed and
provided by the RISE teams, is a whole-class interven-
tion targeting attention skills: the Attention and Listen-
ing Programme (ALP). This intervention has not been
evaluated robustly and, unlike the new intervention de-
veloped in this study, it is not underpinned by working
memory (WM) theory.
Rationale for developing an intervention that targets WM
Working memory (the ability to hold in mind and men-
tally manipulate information over short periods of time
in the face of distraction) is a cognitive skill linked to
both everyday attentional skills and language develop-
ment [ 13,14]. Interventions aimed at improving WM
may therefore enhance these closely related real-world
skills [ 15]. However, the potential for WM interventions,
and in particular computer-based training programmes,
to improve untrained WM tasks and real-world skills
(transfer effects) has been widely debated [ 16].
Overall, the evidence indicates that existing computer-
based training programmes consistently produce gains
on the trained tasks and closely related memory tasks
[17,18]. It has been suggested that to improve the thera-
peutic value of WM training, it may be necessary to
embed it within typical classroom activities that are eco-
logically valid [ 19]. To test this, a new intervention was
developed in the current study: the ‘Recall to Enhance
Children ’s Attention Language and Learning ’(RECALL)
programme. This is a theoretically underpinned,
evidence-based intervention that targets WM in 4 –5-
year-old children through group and whole-class activ-
ities over a 6-week period.
The experimental RECALL intervention is designed to
be delivered by HPs from the RISE teams and teachers,
and is co-produced with a group of these practitioners
through a series of interactive workshops [ 20–22]. The
intervention delivery model follows the current,Rowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:45 Page 2 of 16
collaborative practice of the RISE teams and schools in
NI, where HPs model intervention sessions in the class-
room so that teachers can observe the activities and
strategies used and integrate them into their teaching. In
this model, teachers are not trained directly in how to
deliver classroom-based interventions, i.e., it is assumed
that observing the HPs will be sufficient for them to rep-
licate the intervention sessions. This has been suggested
as a mutually beneficial aspect of collaborative practice
in schools and a way of increasing intervention dosage
for children at risk of language disorder within the con-
straints of the limited resource available for this work
[23]. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this
approach [ 3], so the feasibility of this model and how it
may affect the fidelity of the intervention delivery was
uncertain.
Rationale for conducting a feasibility trial
Prior to conducting a definitive trial of RECALL, it was
crucial to conduct a feasibility trial to deepen the under-
standing of the intervention [ 24] and to test whether it
could be run with children as young as 4 years in a
group setting with fidelity to its protocol. Previous evi-
dence for classroom-based WM training interventions
has been run with older children (6 –7 year olds) who
were trained on a one-to-one basis [ 25]. Little is cur-
rently known about the factors that might influence the
implementation and dosage of classroom-based inter-
ventions for younger children with language disorder
[26,27]. The current study aimed to resolve the uncer-
tainties about the feasibility of the experimental RECA
LL intervention and its delivery in a real-life context in
which HPs model interventions for teachers. The exist-
ing collaborative practice between the RISE teams and
schools in NI provided the optimal setting in which to
investigate these issues.
Study aims and objectives
This study aimed to determine the feasibility of conduct-
ing a definitive cluster randomised trial (CRT) evaluating
whether RECALL is more effective than an existing
intervention (ALP), and ‘education as usual ’,i n4 –5 year
olds from areas of SD. The specific objectives of the
study were as follows:
i) To examine the feasibility of the recruitment and
sampling procedures.
ii) To measure the compliance and fidelity of the
intervention delivery and explore the influence of
the intervention delivery model on these factors.
iii) To explore the acceptability of RECALL to HPs and
teachers who deliver classroom-based interventions
in mainstream schools.iv) To investigate the appropriateness of the outcome
measures completed by teachers, children and their
parents
Methods
This section provides a summary of the study design,
methods of the feasibility trial and the interventions im-
plemented (RECALL and RISE). The study was designed
and is reported according to the CONSORT 2010 exten-
sion to cluster randomised pilot and feasibility trials
[28]. The trial was registered with the International
Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry (ISRC
TN13633886). Comprehensive details can be accessed in
the study protocol associated with this trial [ 29].
Study design
This was a three-arm, cluster randomised feasibility trial
with a parallel group design that took place in two
HSCT areas in NI. Two classes of 4 –5 year olds were
randomly allocated to each arm of the trial: (i) RECALL
(experimental condition); (ii) the existing ALP interven-
tion developed by the RISE teams (active control condi-
tion); and (iii) education as usual (no intervention
condition). The experimental RECALL and active con-
trol interventions were delivered by HPs from the RISE
teams once per week, followed up by two practice ses-
sions delivered by teachers. Children ’s outcomes were
measured at baseline and 1-week post-intervention by
research assistants (RAs). A process evaluation was con-
ducted as part of the feasibility trial [ 30,31]. This was
based primarily on the framework for the design and
reporting of process evaluations of cluster randomised
trials [ 28]. It also included elements of Steckler and Lin-
nan’s model [ 32] that are relevant to the delivery of
classroom-based interventions. These included (i) the
consideration of context (local factors that influence im-
plementation); (ii) fidelity (the extent to which the inter-
vention is delivered as conceived); (iii) the dose delivered
(the amount of intervention offered to participants); and
(iv) the dose accessed by individuals (the extent of par-
ticipants ’engagement in the intervention).
Recruitment and sampling
Target population
The target population were HPs from the RISE teams
(SLTs, OTs, PTs and SEBs) who had experience of deliv-
ering classroom-based interventions and were not in-
volved in the co-production of RECALL, mainstream
primary schools situated in areas of SD based on data
from the Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Meas-
ure (NIMDM) [ 33], teachers who had not previously re-
ceived the ALP intervention and 4 –5-year-old children.Rowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:45 Page 3 of 16
Recruitment targets and sampling
As this was a feasibility study, a formal a priori power
calculation was not conducted [ 34]. The results will not
be used to estimate the sample size, intra-cluster correl-
ation or treatment effects for a definitive trial because, in
the case of cluster randomised feasibility trials, these can
be unrealistic and misleading [ 35,36]. Therefore, the re-
cruitment targets in terms of clusters (schools) and indi-
vidual participants were based on what was required to
address the uncertainties about RECALL and its delivery
in real-life contexts. The recruitment targets were eight
HPs from the RISE teams and six schools. The aim was
to recruit one class of 4 –5 year olds in each school, with
approximately 30 children in each class. In each class,
the aim was to recruit a sample of 10 children in order
to trial the outcome measures, meaning the total num-
ber of children involved in the study was 60.
To represent the typical range of ability in mainstream
schools, a stratified sampling frame was used so that the
sample of ten children from each class included three
groups: (i) children about whom teachers have concerns
around listening and communication skills but do not
have a diagnosed developmental or intellectual difficulty
(n=5 per school, n=30 in total); (ii) children with di-
agnosed developmental or intellectual difficulties ( n= 2
per class, n= 12 in total); and (iii) typically developing
children who do not have any identified listening and
communication problems as recognised by the teachers
(n = 3 per class, n=18 in total). The proportion of chil-
dren within each strata was determined on the basis of
data regarding the incidence of special educational needs
in mainstream schools in NI [ 37].
Randomisation and blinding
Since the population of interest in this study is young
children from areas of SD, it is possible that they may be
in receipt of other interventions at the same time as
RECALL. In a future full-scale trial of the effectiveness
of RECALL, it will be vital to control for this confound-
ing variable. Hence, there was a clear need to randomise
the allocation of schools in this feasibility study. Ran-
domisation took place at the school level after baseline
data collection. The school names were placed in opaque
envelopes that were randomly selected and allocated by
the third investigator (overseen by the second investiga-
tor). The HPs were not blinded to the schools ’allocation
as they inevitably knew which intervention they were de-
livering to which school. The school participants (princi-
pals, teachers and parents) and the RAs who conducted
the outcome measurement with the children were blind
to the allocation, i.e., they did not know which schools
received the experimental RECALL intervention, the
existing ALP intervention or education as usual (no
intervention).Interventions
The experimental RECALL and active control (ALP) in-
terventions were both 6-week interventions consisting of
40-min sessions repeated three times per week. Follow-
ing the intervention delivery model typically employed
by the RISE teams, the HPs modelled the first session
each week for the teachers who provided two further
practice sessions during the week (18 sessions in total).
Details of these interventions are reported here accord-
ing to the Template for Intervention Description and
Replication (TIDieR) Checklist [ 38].
Experimental intervention: RECALL
This novel intervention targets WM explicitly and is
based on a systematic review of evidence suggesting that
repeated practice on certain (non-computerised) activ-
ities can improve WM and have the potential to produce
effects on untrained WM skills (near-transfer) and real-
world skills such as attention and language (far-transfer)
[39]. The common ingredient across the effective inter-
ventions was the executive-loaded nature of the trained
task, i.e., training on a task that taps into attentional and
processing resources under executive control and not
just the storage of information.
RECALL includes 3 executive-loaded tasks with spe-
cified dosage and task progression (Table 1). Each
session starts with a whole-class activity in which a
fantastical theme is introduced for that week using
a puppet, e.g., space. This is based on evidence that
fantastical play supports children ’sW M[ 42]. The
class is then divided into 3 groups (of 9 –10 chil-
dren) that rotate around the three tasks, namely, lis-
tening recall, odd one out and phoneme awareness
tasks (described in Table 1).
Evidence shows that the manipulation of WM loads
on a trial-by-trial basis may be important for improving
WM, i.e., training should be continually challenging
(adaptive) [ 43]. Since RECALL is delivered to groups of
children in the classroom, in the group context, individ-
ual adaptive profiles could not be rolled out. Instead, the
trained tasks are designed to become progressively more
difficult across its 6 weeks (see Table 1). Investigating
the effectiveness of this approach will be a significant
part of a full-scale CRT of RECALL, and capturing indi-
vidual children ’s responses as they complete the tasks
will be important. Two methods of monitoring children ’s
progress from week to week have thus been integrated
into the design of RECALL. For tasks that required a
verbal response (listening recall and some of the phon-
eme awareness tasks), individual digital voice recorders
were trialled with five children. For the odd one out task
and the remaining phoneme awareness tasks, theRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:45 Page 4 of 16
children each had an individual booklet in which they
marked their response using stampers.
To enable the HPs to deliver the intervention with fi-
delity to its protocol, they attended a 2-day training
course prior to delivering RECALL that was facilitated
by the first investigator. This covered the theoretical
underpinning of RECALL in relation to WM and its as-
sociations with attention and language and also afforded
the participants an opportunity to practise delivering the
intervention tasks. The teachers were not provided with
direct training on the intervention theory or delivery.
This decision was based on two factors. Firstly, in the
current collaborative practice of the RISE teams and
schools, it is assumed that teachers will be able to imple-
ment classroom-based interventions having observed
them in the classroom, without direct training. Mirror-
ing current practice in this way makes this feasibility
study pragmatic. Secondly, evidence from a qualitative
study conducted prior to the intervention development
indicated that, due to resource constraints, it was highly
unlikely that teachers would be released from their
everyday duties to attend training (paper in preparation).
Although direct training was not provided for the
teachers, several steps were taken to support them in de-
livering the intervention delivery with fidelity. The
RECALL package includes a comprehensive facilitators ’
manual which covers the theory underpinning the inter-
vention. It also has detailed session plans with scripted
sections that the teachers can read out when introducing
and delivering the intervention tasks. To make it easy
for teachers to deliver RECALL, all of the resources re-
quired for each session are provided. Furthermore, to
encourage the teachers ’compliance with the interven-
tion delivery regarding the number of sessions provided,
they were asked to complete a log in the RECALL man-
ual to demonstrate that each session was delivered.
Whether these steps were adequate (in the absence of
direct training) to ensure a high level of compliance and
fidelity is an issue that is investigated in this feasibilitystudy, which could have significant implications for
current practice.
Active control intervention: ALP
This pre-existing programme was informally developed
by the RISE teams and aims to improve attention and
listening skills through repeated practice of listening
tasks and teaching children the importance of listening
through visual and verbal cues. It is not underpinned by
WM theory and does not require the children to recall
verbal or visuospatial information.
No intervention control: education as usual
These schools did not receive any classroom-based in-
terventions such as RECALL or ALP during the 6-week
trial period.
Outcomes
Primary outcome measures —feasibility
Table 2provides an overview of the primary outcomes
for this study, which relate to the feasibility of the trial
processes and link directly to the four research
objectives.
With regard to the measures of compliance and fidel-
ity, observations of three RECALL sessions in each
school (one delivered by the HPs and two by the
teacher) were carried out by the first investigator. One
session in each school was observed simultaneously and
rated independently by the second or third investigator
to reduce the risk that a single investigator ’s judgement
of fidelity could introduce bias to the study findings. The
number of RECALL sessions observed in each school
(three out of 18) equates to 16% of the total. This is con-
sistent with suggestions in the literature that, for novel
interventions, a minimum of 10% of their implementa-
tion should be observed [ 22]. Fidelity was scored using a
structured checklist based on Carroll et al. ’s 2007 frame-
work (see Additional file 1)[44]. However, high fidelity
was not determined on the basis of the scores alone, and

out is (left, middle or right), then recall the location of the odd one out

Phoneme awareness [40,41]
- Targets the ability to isolate and manipulate sounds in spoken words,
e.g., identifying the first sound in a word10–15 min per
session.Difficulty increases from alliterative matching to

phonemes based on typical speech sound
development.Rowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:45 Page 5 of 16
there is no a priori defined score for this purpose. Ra-
ther, high or low fidelity was determined on the basis of
whether the essential aspects of the proposed interven-
tion components (in this case the WM load of the task)
had been delivered in a way that RECALL may be effect-
ive. The scores were converted into percentages to allow
comparison between the quality of the intervention de-
livery between the HPs and teachers and between
schools in order to explore the factors that may influ-
ence the implementation of RECALL in real-life con-
texts. The fidelity data were also integrated with the
findings from the semi-structured interviews with the
HPs and teachers who delivered RECALL to determine
the overall acceptability of intervention.
Secondary outcome measures —children ’s WM, attention
and language skills
The secondary outcome measures were standardised as-
sessments of the children ’s WM, attention and language
completed at baseline and 1-week post-intervention. Fol-
lowing good practice in WM research [ 45], this included
standardised assessment of: (i) the trained tasks (listen-
ing recall, odd one out and phoneme awareness); (ii) the
untrained WM tasks (near-transfer); and (iii) attention
and language skills (far-transfer effects). Table 3details
the assessments used. These were administered to deter-
mine the appropriateness of the outcome measures for a
full-scale trial of RECALL (in line with the fourth re-
search objective). The primary uncertainties related to
the ease of administration and the time taken to
complete a full battery of standardised assessments with
4–5 year olds (see Table 2). For these reasons, there wereconcerns around two measures in particular, i.e., the
phoneme isolation subtest of the Preschool and Primary
Inventory of Phonological Awareness (PIPA) [ 47] for
phoneme awareness and the comprehension scale of the
New Reynell Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS)
[49] for language. Consequently, two alternative mea-
sures were trialled in one randomly selected school ( n=
10 children): the phoneme segmentation subtest of the
PIPA for phoneme awareness and the Clinical Evalu-
ation of Language Fundamentals —Preschool (CELF-P)
[50] for language. These two subtests were not included
in the measures administered in the other 5 participating
schools.
Data analysis
Regarding the primary outcomes, the feasibility data on
recruitment rates, compliance and fidelity were analysed
descriptively using means and percentages. The qualita-
tive data collected via the semi-structured interviews
with the HPs and teachers who delivered RECALL were
audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using
Braun and Clarke ’s[53] approach to thematic analysis.
This analysis was underpinned by a realist research para-
digm [ 54,55] that informed every stage of the develop-
ment of RECALL and the design and conduct of the
current feasibility trial. The realist paradigm recognises
the influence of context on the implementation and ul-
timate effectiveness of interventions in real-life settings
[56].
The six phases of Braun and Clarke ’s thematic analysis
method [ 53] were followed to derive themes from the
data in an inductive approach. To summarise theTable 2 Primary outcome measures —feasibility, data collected

approach taken, each transcript was read, re-read and
coded systematically with semantic codes, generated
using the participants ’own words. The first investigator
(A.R.) coded all of the transcripts, and the second inves-
tigator (J.T.) independently coded one complete tran-
script in a form of investigator triangulation [ 57]. The
list of semantic codes was sorted into meaningful candi-
date themes, which were then depicted in visual repre-
sentations (thematic maps) to examine the relationships
between them. At this point, the initial list of codes was
revisited, and the full data set was consulted again. The
candidate themes were discussed on several occasions
until set themes and sub-themes were agreed. Finally,
during the writing up process, the wording of the
themes was again revised by revisiting the full data set,
initial codes and thematic maps in order to ensure the
final interpretation of the data fully reflected the essence
of the participants ’views.Regarding the secondary outcomes, the data obtained
from the standardised assessments completed with the
children were not analyses for statistical significance of
treatment effects because this study was under-powered
for this purpose.
Ethical approval
Ethical approval was granted by the Ulster University
Research Ethics Committee (REC/18/0036), and ap-
proval was obtained from the relevant HSCT research
offices.

Recruitment and sampling
Recruitment rates
Figure 1shows the CONSORT flow chart [ 28] including
the response, recruitment and retention rates through-
out the study. It shows that recruitment targets were
met in terms of the total number of HPs ( n=8), schools
(n=6) and children ( n=60). After the exclusion criteria
were applied, 10 schools were invited to participate in
the study, and 9 responded. Of these, 6 schools were
randomly selected to take part. In terms of retention, no
schools or individual participants dropped out of the
study.
Sampling
Table 4provides details of the numbers and characteris-
tics of the schools (clusters) and the individual partici-
pants recruited to the study compared to the
recruitment targets. This shows that, whilst the overall
recruitment targets were achieved, some aspects of the
recruitment process did not achieve their aim. Due to
staff absence (maternity leave/sick leave), the RISE teams
could only facilitate the study in particular geographical
sectors within their HSCT areas. Consequently, from the
list of schools identified in areas of SD ( n= 43), a con-
siderable number ( n= 17) had to be excluded on the
basis of their location. As a result, the criteria in respect
of SD were widened to include schools ranked within
the lowest quintile within the HSCT (rather than the
lowest decile). The overall rate of parental consent (72%)
was good. However, some parents of children about
whom teachers had concerns did not consent, and the
desired proportion of children in this sub-group was not
achieved ( n=22, 37% compared to the target of n=30,
50%). It was also apparent during the sampling process
that teachers did not always know whether children did/
did not have a diagnosis. Two children did not complete
post-intervention assessments as they were absent from
school, indicating minimal loss to follow-up (3%).
Compliance and fidelity to the intervention delivery
The data gathered through the activity logs completed
by teachers in their RECALL manuals indicated that
there was good compliance with the intervention deliv-
ery regarding the total number of sessions completed
(95%) and the number of trials delivered (11 practice
items of listening recall and odd one out, and 10 –15 min
of phoneme awareness training). In terms of the quality
of delivery, for the RECALL sessions delivered by the
HPs, there was a good degree of fidelity to the interven-
tion protocol (76%). For the teacher-delivered sessions,
fidelity varied between the 2 schools (there was a highdegree of inter-rater consistency on the fidelity measure
across the research team): school 1 (76%) and school 2
(45%). The observation data collected during the school
visits and the qualitative data from the semi-structured
interviews revealed that this discrepancy related to the
delivery of the odd one out task during the teacher-
delivered RECALL sessions. In school 1, the teacher di-
vided the class into three groups, as specified in the
intervention protocol. In school 2, the teacher presented
the task to all of the children at the same time, holding
up the picture stimuli and walking around the classroom
until each child had seen them. Then, the children all
stamped the location of the odd one out picture in their
booklets. The interview carried out with this teacher re-
vealed that she changed the task in this way because she
prefers to work with the whole class together. The result
was that it lengthened the time that the children had to
hold the information in their WM, both changing the
nature of the task and making it too difficult. The overall
duration of the session also increased, and the children,
especially those who were inattentive, became unmoti-
vated and restless.
The acceptability of RECALL
The data gathered through the observations of RECALL
in the classroom and via the semi-structured interviews
with the HPs and teachers indicated mixed findings in
relation to the acceptability Figure 2shows that three
major themes were identified through the integration of
these data. Each theme is described below along with
some exemplar quotes from participants.
Theme 1: some RECALL components are acceptable
All of the HPs and teachers liked the fantastical play
component of RECALL, reporting that the puppet, fan-
tastical themes and props were appropriate and fun for
4–5-year-old children. The phoneme awareness tasks
were easy to administer due to their similarity to usual
classroom practice. The listening recall task was also
quick and easy to administer. It was at an appropriate
level of difficulty (with both the teachers and the HPs
reporting that the children seemed to improve across
the 6-week intervention period) and engaged the class.
The fact that the sentences tied in with the fantastical
themes and were funny seemed to appeal to even the
most inattentive children. One of the teachers reported:
I think, the listening recall one benefitted and in-
volved every child …..It was actually boys I noticed
who probably stick out with the listening recall and
the boys who like imaginative play and who like a
giggle. So, I actually found that really related to
boys. It related to everybody, but they stood out. It
surprised me that they were interested. It was justRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:45 Page 8 of 16

because they thought it was funny, so it just hooked
them in and they wanted to be part of it.
The use of individual digital voice recorders (to moni-
tor the children ’s performance on the listening recall
and some of the phoneme awareness tasks) was imprac-
tical. The devices used were acceptable to the HPs and
teachers because they were unobtrusive and did not
interfere with the delivery of the task. However, the mi-
crophones picked up too much background noise from
the classroom, meaning the child ’s voice could not be
distinguished. It was also difficult to hear the facilitator ’s
voice when presenting the trial items, so the accuracy of
the child ’s response could not be judged.
Theme 2: odd one out is challenging
None of the HPs or teachers liked the odd one out task
in its current format. The teachers were uncertain about
the nature of this specific task and how to deliver it, e.g.,
whether it was acceptable for children to place their fin-
gers on the location of the odd one out picture in their
booklets. The children needed help to turn the pages of
the booklets. Many of the children were distracted by
the stampers and tended to stamp ad hoc in their book-
lets. To manage this, the HPs or teachers had to repeat-
edly pause the task to ensure all of the children were on
the right page. This disrupted the flow of the activity
and elongated it, meaning that the task could not be de-
livered in a way that would be effective, and the data
gathered in the booklets were unreliable.
In addition, the participants all reported that there
were too many trial items per session so the children be-
came unmotivated, especially those with existing atten-
tion difficulties who tended to copy their peers ’
responses. The HPs and teachers all stated that the diffi-
culty level increased too quickly and the children would
have benefitted from additional practice at the 2-to-be-
remembered item level. One of the teachers stated:I found it was a very big challenge for a lot of them
[the children]. At the start it wasn ’t too bad, but
then as it progressed and maybe you were at three
odd one out on the one page, then four- it was
really, really difficult. Again, those few [children] in
the top group would have been trying to focus really
well but so many just lost it and a lot of them were
randomly stamping. The wee weaker groups, they
just weren ’t focused at all.
Theme 3: groups are too big
Whilst the use of booklets and stampers to record chil-
dren’s responses impacted on the acceptability of RECA
LL, the size of the groups was also identified as a barrier
to the intervention delivery. The number of children in
the class (divided into groups of 9 or 10) made it diffi-
cult to deliver the tasks and to monitor children ’s pro-
gress. This was noted by all of the HPs and teachers
during the semi-structured interviews (even for the lis-
tening recall task which was universally liked by the
participants).
This was summed up by one of the HPs:
…..if there was less children it would be so much
easier to guide and judge how they were doing. Be-
cause you were only getting a general idea [of how
they were doing].
The appropriateness of the outcome measures
As stated earlier, a future large-scale trial of the effect-
iveness of RECALL would have to include a range of
measures of children ’s outcomes including measures of
the trained activities (WM and phoneme awareness
skills), untrained WM tasks (near-transfer) and attention
and language skills (far-transfer effects) [ 45] (Table 3).
The primary uncertainties here related to the ease of ad-
ministration and the time taken to complete a fullTable 4 Participant characteristics

battery of standardised assessments with 4 –5 year olds
(see Table 2).
Overall, the rate of completion at the post-
intervention time point shows that 95% of the standar-
dised assessments were completed with the children (see
Fig. 1). However, reports from the RAs who conductedthe outcome measurement indicated that administering
the full battery of assessments with each child was time-
consuming (on average more than 1 h per child). This
may have impacted negatively on the children ’s motiv-
ation and performance. In particular, the New Reynell
Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS) took a

considerable amount of time to complete, whereas the
Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals —Pre-
school (CELF-P) [ 50] (trialled in one school for compari-
son) was much quicker to administer. With regard to
the auditory attention and statue subtests of the Devel-
opmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY-II)
[48], all of the RAs found it difficult to observe and sim-
ultaneously record the children ’s performance. There-
fore, they doubted the accuracy of their scoring. If this
test were used in a full trial, thorough training and prac-
tice should be provided to those administering it, and
inter-rater reliability must be measured.
Regarding the proxy measures of children ’s functional
skills, 100% of the teacher rating scales of attention in
the classroom were completed at both time-points (pre-
and post-intervention) using the Behaviour Rating Scale
of Executive Function —Preschool Version (BRIEF-P)
[51]. This suggests that the checklist was acceptable to
teachers. Children ’s communication skills at home were
measured using the Focus on Communication Outcomes
Under Six –34 (FOCUS-34) [ 52]. This tool looks at
change/improvement in the child ’s communication skills
over time (rather than providing a direct measure of
their ability). It should be completed by the same parent
at each time point with support from a SLT [ 52]. Due to
the classroom-based nature of this trial, the forms were
sent home for parents to complete and return to the
school. Therefore, the parents completed this measure
without support. Completed checklists were returned at
both time points for 35 children (58% of the sample),
but examination of the raw data indicated that for 8 chil-
dren the forms were not completed by the same parent
at the two time points. This raises questions about the
reliability of the data. Furthermore, two outlying scores
were apparent indicating possible misunderstanding of
scoring (a Likert scale) by the parents. In a future trial,
greater support would need to be provided to parents
(as outlined in the protocol for the FOCUS-34) to avoid
these potential issues.
Discussion
This study responds to calls for globally significant,
rigorous and ecologically valid research into collabora-
tive, classroom-based approaches for children at risk of
language disorders and the factors that may impact on
their delivery [ 3–7]. To our knowledge, RECALL is the
first theoretically underpinned, evidence-based,
classroom-based intervention that specifically targets
WM to enhance attention and language skills in 4 –5-
year-old children from areas of SD.
The overall research aim was to determine whether it
is possible to conduct a definitive CRT to evaluate
whether RECALL is more effective than an existing
intervention (ALP) and education as usual. Thesuccessful recruitment of HPs, schools and children
from areas of SD; high completion rates; and minimal
loss to follow-up suggest that the trial processes could
be scaled-up into a definitive trial. However, because
staffing levels within the RISE teams may fluctuate, con-
sultation with the service managers will be essential for
the successful roll out of a large-scale study. With regard
to the generalisability of the study findings to areas in
the UK or beyond that do not have support equivalent
to the RISE teams, it is envisioned that RECALL could
be delivered by any HPs working within school-based
services, where the provision of classroom-based support
has become a routine aspect of practice [ 3].
The stratified sampling method employed in the
current study should be modified because this was af-
fected by ambiguity around whether some children had
a diagnosis or not. Therefore, in a large trial, the three
strata could be collapsed into two: typically developing
children and those about whom teachers have concerns
and may/may not have a diagnosis. In this study, there
was an under-representation of children with develop-
mental difficulties, which seemed to be related to par-
ents not consenting to participation (rather than small
number of children in these classes with difficulties).
This is a potential source of bias that must be addressed
in a larger trial. Engagement with key stakeholders was
an important facet of the development of RECALL and
the feasibility of carrying out the current study. Further
consultation with professionals (HPs, teachers, school
principals and other representatives from the education
sector) will be carried out prior to the roll out of a larger
trial to identify ways of increasing parental consent rates
for this population.
Including children considered to be typically develop-
ing would be valuable in a large trial since high propor-
tions of children in areas of SD are at risk of language
disorders, and little is known about the individual differ-
ences that moderate the effects of WM training [ 58] and
language interventions [ 59]. A full trial will require a
large sample with sufficient power to detect differences
between subgroups of children as well as intervention
groups [ 35].
The second research objective was to measure the
compliance and fidelity to the intervention protocol.
Overall, the compliance levels were good with the vast
majority of the intervention sessions (95%), suggesting it
would be feasible to conduct a full-scale trial of RECA
LL. The high level of fidelity to the intervention protocol
during the RECALL sessions delivered by the HPs (76%)
(that would have been higher if the odd one out task
had been easier to deliver) also supports the concept of
conducting a full trial. Furthermore, it suggests that 2
days of training adequately enables HPs to deliver RECA
LL. Regarding the teacher-delivered sessions, theRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:45 Page 12 of 16
inconsistency and variation in fidelity between the two
teachers' delvery of RECALL highlight the importance of
facilitator factors in intervention delivery. The teachers ’
uncertainty about how to deliver the tasks demonstrates
that the detailed intervention manual and demonstration
provided by the trained HPs were not sufficient. This
supports the provision of direct training on the theoret-
ical underpinning and delivery of RECALL for all
teachers involved in a future definitive trial of the inter-
vention. This should include a minimum of 8 h direct in-
struction, as well as coaching and feedback [ 3]. Teachers
could also be given a video of the tasks being demon-
strated accurately that they could refer to as required to
support their implementation in the classroom. These
measures would better ensure fidelity of task delivery
which is essential for the therapeutic effectiveness of the
intervention, particularly the odd-one-out task (and was
lost for half of the participants in the RECALL arm of
this trial).
Exploration of the acceptability of RECALL pro-
duced mixed findings. The HPs and teachers liked the
listening recall and fantastical play components. These
were considered to be fun and at an appropriate level
for 4 –5 year olds. The phoneme awareness component
was also acceptable. The fact that the teachers re-
ported that these tasks are similar to their usual prac-
t i c em a ys u g g e s tt h e ya r en o tr e q u i r e di nR E C A L L .
However, since the descriptive analysis of the post-
intervention scores showed a trend towards improve-
ment for the intervention groups, further investigation
of the effectiveness of these tasks could be valuable in
a full-scale trial.
The odd one out task is not acceptable to HPs or
teachers in its current form for two key reasons. First,
they found it difficult to manage the materials, which in-
cluded picture stimuli, booklets and stampers. Second,
many of the children became inattentive during this task.
These factors relate to the task itself, but also to the
classroom setting and the children ’s characteristics. The
task delivery could be simplified by enabling the children
to indicate the odd one out location by pointing. The
dose delivered per session (11 practice items) and dose
frequency (three times per week) may also have been
too intense for 4 –5 year olds. In addition, from week
three onwards, the task became too difficult, i.e., there
were too many items to be remembered. These findings
are consistent with emerging evidence regarding the ef-
fects of dosage on the outcomes of language interven-
tions, suggesting that if treatment is too intense it can
be detrimental to children ’s learning [ 5,26,59]. The
current study underscores the need for robust investiga-
tion of dosage in both WM and language interventions.
Modifications to RECALL, including the task delivery
and its dosage, could be explored through further co-production work and small group work with 4 –5 year
olds prior to a full-scale trial.
In relation to the classroom setting and the children ’s
characteristics, the potential effectiveness of RECALL
was impeded by the size of the groups set up for the task
(9–10 children) and their composition, where the weaker
children were observed copying their more-able peers.
Many of the children, particularly the most at risk chil-
dren (already presenting with inattentive behaviour in
the classroom) became unmotivated by a task that was
too challenging for them.
The evidence discussed so far has illuminated a dy-
namic interplay between the way a therapeutic task is
presented and its difficulty level (dose form), the setting
within which it is delivered such as group size, children ’s
characteristics including their motivation and attention
and facilitator characteristics, e.g., theoretical knowledge
of the task and how to deliver it and personal preference
in terms of teaching methods. This complex blend im-
pacts on and can dilute the number of trials accessed by
individual children, particularly those who are most at
risk of language disorder. Figure 3graphically represents
this.
Regarding the appropriateness of the pre-and post-
intervention outcome measures, the descriptive statistics
suggest that the following measures could be used in a
full trial: the AWMA for working memory, the phoneme
isolation subtest of the PIPA for phoneme awareness,
the BRIEF-P and FOCUS-34 (completed according to
the protocol) as proxy ratings of attention in the class-
room and communication skills at home and the NEPS
Y-II for attention (provided thorough training is pro-
vided for those administering it and the inter-rater reli-
ability is assessed). The phoneme segmentation subtest
of the PIPA could be used in addition to the phoneme
isolation subtest. This would add minimal time to the
assessment process, and its inclusion would mitigate
against any risk of reduced sensitivity of the phoneme
isolation subtest, which many of the children performed
well on in the current study. To assess language, the
NRDLS should be replaced by the CELF-P since this
takes less time to administer and should be more accept-
able for both the child and RA administering it. The use
of digital voice recorders to monitor verbal responses is
not feasible in the classroom setting, and the use of
booklets impeded the completion of the odd one out
task. Therefore, alternative methods of monitoring chil-
dren’s performance on a weekly basis, perhaps by a
trained observer, will be required in a definitive trial.
Limitations of the present study
This was a small scale study with just two schools in
each arm of the trial. However, the findings are strength-
ened by the study design through the inclusion of anRowe et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:45 Page 13 of 16
active control group receiving an intervention of com-
parable structure and dosage to the experimental RECA
LL intervention. The need to widen the school eligibility
criteria to include those in the lowest quintile of SD
means that half the sample were in less disadvantaged
areas than originally anticipated. This raises questions
about whether the findings are generalisable to schools
in more disadvantaged areas of NI or beyond. In
addition, compliance and fidelity to the delivery of the
active control intervention was not measured and this
should be addressed in a definitive trial.
Conclusions
RECALL is a novel, multi-component intervention that
targets WM to enhance attention and language skills. To
our knowledge, this is the first paper to report on the
feasibility of implementing a WM intervention in real-
life contexts. With the exception of the methods used to
monitor children ’s progress from week to week, the trial
processes could be scaled-up into a future definitive trial
to evaluate the effectiveness of RECALL.
In relation to the intervention components, this study
has provided unique evidence of the potential effective-
ness of the two directly trained WM tasks (listening re-
call and odd one out) for children as young as 4 –5 years.
Listening recall was implemented successfully and was
acceptable to the HPs and teachers who delivered the
intervention; and odd one out could be modified to en-
hance its acceptability and the fidelity of its delivery.Overall, the potential effectiveness of RECALL for the
children who may benefit most from it (i.e., those pre-
senting as inattentive in the classroom and are at risk of
low WM) could be optimised if it were implemented in
small group settings. This would enhance its acceptabil-
ity to HPs and teachers and improve its potential effect-
iveness by maximising the dosage accessed by individual
children. RECALL could be modified through further
co-production work and feasibility testing involving
small group work with 4 –5 year olds. This study has
highlighted the challenges of balancing empirically evi-
denced dosage with the feasibility and acceptability of
what can be delivered in real-life contexts. Furthermore,
it emphasises the need for teachers to have thorough
training on the theoretical underpinning to interventions
for children with language disorders in the mainstream
classroom.
