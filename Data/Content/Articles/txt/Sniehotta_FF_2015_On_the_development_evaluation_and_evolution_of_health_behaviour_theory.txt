(Received 1 February 2015; accepted 22 February 2015 )
Behavioural science has advanced considerably over the past decade. Recent guidelines
and methods for intervention development, reporting and evaluation (Bartholomew,
Parcel, Kok, Gottlieb, & Fernández, 2011 ; Craig et al., 2008 ; Davidson et al., 2003 ;
Hoffman et al., 2014 ; Moore et al., 2014 ) have provided a solid foundation for a more
rigorous, replicable science and practice of behaviour change. Guidelines converge in
highlighting the importance of a strong theoretical basis for designing and evaluating
behavioural interventions, both, to optimise effects and to facilitate an understanding of
why interventions do or do not work and in what circumstances. While there is consensus
on the importance of theory, it is uncertain to what degree some of the popular theories ofbehaviour are fit for purpose. Many health behaviour theories have remained unchanged
for decades despite limited evidence to date that interventions based on health behaviour
theories are any more effective than interventions not based on theory (Prestwich et al.,
2014 ). The lack of development in health behaviour theories may indicate that the
mechanisms of testing and developing theory are not efficient.
In proposing that it is ‘time to retire the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) ’
(Sniehotta, Presseau, & Araújo-Soares, 2014 ) we aimed to further the debate initiated by
Head and Noar ( 2014 ; Noar & Head, 2014 ) about the pressing need to clarify a process of
formulating, testing and applying behavioural theory to deliver scientific progress. To
achieve this, it would be helpful to agree on how and when to change or abandon theories
that no longer accurately represent current knowledge. We focused on the TPB as an
example of a theory that remains very popular despite its well-documented limitations,
but the nature of this debate also extends to other popular social cognition models(cf. Rhodes, 2015 ; Schwarzer, 2015 ).
We highlighted the key limitations of the TPB, some of which have been raised
before by others (French & Hankins, 2003 ; Greve, 2001 ; Ogden, 2003 ). We concluded
that the set of prepositions that form the conceptual core of the TPB, including its
mediation hypotheses and the sufficiency hypotheses are partially inaccurate and do not
sufficiently account for established and useful knowledge about the determinants of

behaviour (change) and the conditions under which these determinants operate. In
suggesting the retirement of the TPB, we fully advocate drawing on what we have
learned from the theory and incorporating this knowledge into theories that provide a
better match to empirical observations and greater utility for research and practice, as isindeed already happening (Hall, 2015 ; Rhodes, 2015 ; Schwarzer, 2015 ). We are not
proposing theory proliferation for the sake of it. Rather, we wish to underscore the
purpose of theory and inspire a debate about how this purpose can best be achieved.
In this response we address the points raised in comments to our initial editorial
specifically about the TPB as well as wider issues about the nature, development, andevaluation and proliferation of health behaviour theories. We suggest possible explana-
tions for the disagreement between scholars on popular theories that are not in line with
current knowledge and discuss possible ways forward which may help to contribute to thediscussion about how to overcome the immortality of health behaviour theories.
Reactions
Clearly, our editorial struck a note. Ten commentaries from leading international scholars
confirmed this is a debate worth having and that views on the matter are both strong and
diverse. We are grateful to the authors of these commentaries for their insightfulreflections. On the whole, with few exceptions, commentators largely supported the idea
of building on what we have learned with the TPB and moving on from it. While some
authors offered opposition to our proposal (e.g., Ajzen, 2015 ; Armitage, 2015 ; Conner,
2015 ), others (re)iterated that retiring the TPB is long overdue (Ogden, 2015 ). Some
commentators also took the opportunity to add further criticism to the TPB (Ogden, 2015 ;
Rhodes, 2015 ; Trafimow, 2015 ) to the ones we listed.
One concern about our editorial raised by some was the potential risk of ‘throwing
the baby out with the bathwater ’in retiring the TPB. We previously acknowledged the
historical contributions of the TPB and its predecessors for the development of healthbehaviour science. To clarify our position, there is no doubt that ‘the TPB identifies
some key predictors of health behaviours ’(Conner, 2015 , p. x) and we agree that
intention, perceived behavioural control (PBC), attitude and subjective norm areimportant predictors of behaviour and are potentially relevant to understand and change
behaviour. We were also not suggesting that it would be inappropriate to study these
constructs in their own right. Rather, we take issue with the proposed sufficiency of thecombination of these constructs, and the veracity of the testable hypotheses about
mediation of theory-external influences (all assumed to be fully mediated by TPB
constructs; the sufficiency hypothesis ) and theory-internal influences (e.g., the relation-
ship between attitudes and behaviour is hypothesised to be mediated by intention; the
mediation hypotheses ).
Health behaviour theory has mostly served three main purposes: to educate students
(Rhodes, 2015 ) and practitioners (Abraham, 2015 ), to inform behaviour change
interventions and their evaluation (Abraham, 2015 ; Kok & Ruiter, 2014 ) and/or to guide
cutting edge research by providing empirical hypotheses (Hall, 2015 ). What stands out
from the commentaries is the considerable variability in opinion, language and
conceptualisation of health behaviour theories, the designs used to test and apply them
and the process of theory development.Health Psychology Review 177
How should theories be formulated?
InTable 1 , we propose what we hope is a simple and uncontroversial set of criteria for
empirical health behaviour theories to fulfil.
It is helpful to think of a theory as consisting of at least two elements: (1) a theory core ,i n
which the explanatory concepts as well as their hypothesised relationships to each other andto the observations it aims to explain are defined (Bem & Looren de Jong, 1997 ; Hempel &
Oppenheim, 1948 ) and (2) a set of intended applications , in which the phenomena the
theory aims to explain and in what context, are clarified. A subset of the latter containing
applications successfully tested in research could be seen as the set of successful
applications of that theory (Balzer, Moulines, & Sneed, 1987 ; Westmeyer, 1992 ).
At first glance, the TPB has a reasonably well-defined theory core and the equations
that express the hypothesised relationships between constructs are helpful for formalising
Table 1. Proposed criteria for empirical behaviour change theories.
Criteria Explanation
Core
1. Clarify the
explanandumDefinition of the type of observations/behaviours the theory aims to
explain should be provided.
2. Define constructs Constructs should be defined as conceptually independent of the
explanandum and of other theory constructs.
3. Relationships within
theoryRelationships of constructs should be described as a conceptual
nomological network of hypothesised relationships to facilitate the
operationalisation of the theory in empirical applications (Campbell &Fiske, 1959 ).
4. Explanation The nature of the causal explanation should be explicit (Bem & Looren
de Jong, 1997 ; Hempel & Oppenheim, 1948 ).
5. Mechanisms The mechanisms of action should be specified. Some theory constructs
might not directly relate to the explanandum but indicate steps in a
causal chain hypothesised to lead to behaviour change.
Applications
6. Intended applications The range of behaviour and behaviour change that the theory aims to
explain as well as the circumstances under which the theoreticalprepositions are assumed to apply should be explicitly stated.
7. Successful
applicationsExamples of evidence from empirical studies which support the theory ’s
prepositions and hypotheses. New theories might not have manysuccessful applications yet, but for established theories successful
applications are a measure of how the degree of evidence supporting the
theory.
Context
8. Relationships to
other theoriesDescriptions of how constructs and hypotheses derived from the theory
relate to those in other theories. This allows theory integration (Hagger,
2009 ) and comparative testing of theories against each other (Noar &
Zimmerman, 2005 ).
9. Historical heritage If applicable, the historical heritage of the theory should be explicit.
10. Historical differences Differences between the theory and any theory it replaces should be
explicit.178 F .F. Sniehotta et al.
predictions (Ajzen, 1985 ). However, in his commentary, Ajzen ( 2015 ) formulates a
position which differs from those original and highly specific formulations by stating‘there is nothing in the TPB to preclude addition of new predictors ’(p. x). In fact, adding
variables to any equation or function fundamentally alters the nature of the relationships
expressed. The sufficiency hypothesis is a direct consequence of the equations used to
express the TPB. Moving away from a formal theory specification endorses aninterpretation of the TPB as a pragmatic, parsimonious set of useful explanatoryconstructs rather than a formal theory. With such a position there would be very littledisagreement indeed. However, empirical research requires clarity of a theory core,otherwise, how can a theory be operationalised?
The TPB, like many psychological theories, lacks a clearly defined range of intended
applications and this may explain some of the disagreement on the degree to which thetheory is consistent with evidence. Ajzen ( 2015 , p. x) describes the TPB as ‘meant to help
explain and predict people ’s intention and behaviour ’. His references to systematic reviews
of the TPB suggests that he agrees that any health-related behaviour as reviewed byMcEachan, Conner, Taylor, and Lawton ( 2011 ) is an appropriate application of the TPB.
However, various colleagues refer to the TPB as a theory of motivation that is moreefficient in predicting and potentially changing behavioural intentions than behaviour
(Abraham, 2015 ; Kok & Ruiter, 2014 ; Schwarzer, 2015 ). Moreover, Ajzen ( 2015 ) and
Armitage ( 2015 ) suggest that changing beliefs is only efficient in unmotivated individuals.
Indeed, Trafimow ( 2015 ) points out examples of successful experimental tests of the TPB,
but these do not use behaviour as the outcome. The explanation of intention is seen as oneof the TPB ’s strengths and some argue that there are various successful applications TPB
explaining intention (Trafimow, 2015 ). However, when considering the TPB as a theory of
behaviour, the evidence is less supportive. The work by Orbell and Sheeran ( 1998 ) on the
intention –behaviour gap and the prevalence of inclined abstainers highlights this
discrepancy.
Gollwitzer and Oettingen ( 2015 ) suggested that one should not expect a social
psychology theory such as the TPB to be directly applicable to actual behaviour outsideof the lab without modification. It is true that the application of any theory requirescertain adjustments that reflect the context and specific features of the behaviour andpopulation under study as well as methodological constraints. Some variance in findings
may be due to constraints introduced by theory, some due to the methods used and some
due to the context of application. The TPB has long been used for applications tocomplex health behaviour (Sheeran, Abraham, & Orbell, 1999 ). Ajzen ’s proposed
selection of applications of the TPB deemed to be successful in areas of testicular self-examination (TSE) and condom use suggests that most researchers in the field arecomfortable with applying social cognitive theories to applied problems. Healthbehaviours are complex and important, and applying theories of behaviour to healthbehaviours can contribute an important layer to the development of theory: how relevant
would a social psychological theory be if it were not applicable outside of the lab?
Methods for testing the TPB and other theories
Researchers often attribute successful empirical applications to theory and attribute
unsuccessful applications to methodology (Ogden, 2003 ). To clarify whether theory and/
or method are driving observed findings, ideally a theory should be tested in a multi-
theory –multi-method matrix (Westmeyer, 1992 ). A multi-theory approach suggests thatHealth Psychology Review 179
rather than testing whether observations are consistent with hypotheses made by a given
theory (e.g., testing against an unspecified null hypothesis), progress in psychological
science may be better achieved by testing two plausible but contradictory hypotheses
against each other in the same study, facilitated by the principles summarised in Table 1 .
A multi-method approach provides opportunities for triangulating evidence and a theory
has stronger empirical support if successful applications can be demonstrated over a rangeof methodological operationalisations.
Research on the TPB has predominantly been a mono-theory mono-method
endeavour. Specific guidelines describing how to construct TPB questionnaires (Ajzen,2006 ; Francis et al., 2004 ) have been popular and have resulted in a body of evidence
based on a narrow range of methodological operationalisations mostly focused on
correlational research designs. Meta-analytic reviews of this correlational evidence have
long been taken as supportive of the TPB (McEachan et al., 2011 ). However, the
supportive evidence has not been invariant across methods and there are few successfulapplications of the TPB using other, more rigorous methods. Moreover, the TPB does not
lend itself very well to comparative hypothesis testing due to the nature of its predictions.
One would struggle to formulate plausible alternative hypotheses to the theoreticalprediction: ‘People with a positive intention to act are more likely to act than those
without such an intention ’(Greve, 2001 ).
Experimental tests of the TPB and behaviour change
We have argued that the TPB has failed experimental tests (Sniehotta, 2009 ; Sniehotta
et al., 2014 ). While most commentators agreed, Ajzen made three arguments to support
the TPB: (1) the TPB is not a theory of behaviour change , but a theory that explains
intentions and behaviours, (2) 10 specific conditions need to be fulfilled to provide avalid experimental test of the TPB (noting that no previous negative tests have fulfilled
these criteria) and (3) examples of applications satisfying these criteria do support the
TPB. We address these arguments in turn below.
(1) Ajzen ( 2015 , p. x) states that the TPB is not a theory of behaviour change but can
be a ‘useful framework ’to inform behaviour change interventions. If the TPB
does not explain behaviour change, it implies the theory is immune to
experimental tests that by definition require the element of change. The validityof such an immunity statement is questionable. Previously we referred to the TPB
as‘static ’and we are grateful to Ajzen ( 2015 ) and Schwarzer ( 2015 ) for pointing
out that this terminology might be open to misunderstanding. Ajzen has
repeatedly stated that experiences of behaviour can influence cognitions.
Acknowledging that such a feedback process occurs without theorising how
behaviour may shape cognitions leaves the TPB lacking the level of elaboration
which would allow an explanation for behaviour change. One of the TPB ’s
contemporary ’s, Bandura ’s social cognitive theory (SCT; Bandura, 1997 ) offers a
helpful level of theorising about these relationships based on reciprocal
determinism and individual attributions. There is no reason why these links
should remain unspecified in the seminal descriptions of the theory over decades
when they are critical for the phenomena that the TPB aims to explain.
(2) The TPB is a parsimonious theory with only four aggregate explanatory
constructs. Ajzen proposes that 10 steps are required to ensure valid development180 F .F. Sniehotta et al.
and evaluation of a TPB-based intervention [see Ajzen ( 2015 ) for the full
description of these steps]. Roughly, these steps fall into two sets. The first setunderscores the need for belief elicitation, development of intervention compo-nents and evaluation studies to ensure that an intervention produces ‘large changes
in the targeted beliefs and that it does not have countervailing impact effects onunmentioned beliefs ’(Ajzen, 2015 , p. x) and ‘appreciable significant impact on
the aggregates of behavioural, normative and/or control beliefs ’(p. x). The
practical implication of this first set of criteria is that one needs a fully powered
trial to estimate the effect sizes of a draft intervention on various TPB componentswith a small margin of error before one can even consider the intervention as TPB-based. If the effects are not quite of a large enough magnitude, the implication isthat one needs to go back, revise the intervention and run another fully poweredtrial to test for the effects on TPB mediators and so on. Given the funding andpracticalities of applied research, it might be unreasonable to expect that this firstset of criteria will often be met. Realistically, in practice, intervention developersand evaluators typically conduct careful, iterative piloting and development workwith a view to running onelarge trial to simultaneously evaluate the effects on
TPB cognitions and behaviour. As a result of these proposed steps, the TPB isinsulated from trial null findings that might be attributed to a lack of sufficienteffects on targeted beliefs rather than to the TPB itself.
The second set involves four steps required to address any evidence of
intention –behaviour discrepancies (of which there is ample evidence across all
applications of the TPB to health behaviours, cf. McEachan et al., 2011 ). The
proposed steps require an intervener to make sure that ‘the beliefs accessible in
the behavioural context do not differ substantially from the accessible beliefs [ …]
identified in the elicitation phase ’,‘that participants have the means, skills and
other resources to perform the behaviour of interest ’,‘that all potential barriers to
its performance have been removed ’and‘that no unanticipated events or new
information have led to revised intentions after the intervention has taken place ’
(Ajzen, 2015 , p. x). There are practical and conceptual implications for this
second set of criteria. Most readers with first-hand experience of developing andevaluating health behaviour change interventions might find it difficult to see howthey can continuously control the accessibility of people ’s beliefs, or the
occurrence of unanticipated events. It does not always seem feasible to expectinterventions to remove all barriers or provide people with boundless resources.The TPB itself does little to suggest how one would go about achieving thesecriteria and does not provide any constructs to explain the underlying processes.The TPB does not theorise on the self-regulatory processes involved inovercoming barriers (although other theories do; cf. Hall, 2015 ; Schwarzer,
2015 ), on dealing with a lack of skills and resources or on maintaining positive
cognitions and motivation over time or in response to new events. The TPBleaves these processes unspecified and, as a result, any behaviour change shownby following these steps might still not reflect the mechanisms described inthe TPB.
(3) Ajzen argues that studies that fulfil the 10 criteria do support the TPB and
identifies four studies of TPB-based interventions he considers to be good andsuccessful applications of the TPB (Brubaker & Fowler, 1990 ; Jemmott, Jemmott,
& Fong, 1998 ; Murphy & Brubaker, 1990 ; Sanderson & Jemmott, 1996 ). TheseHealth Psychology Review 181
studies evaluated interventions on self-reported outcome measures of testicular
self-examination, safer-sex and sexual abstinence. We analysed these studiesusing the Cochrane risk of bias tool (Higgins et al., 2011 ) and found that Murphy
and Brubaker ( 1990 ) has a high risk of bias from methods used to assign
participants to conditions, justify sample size in terms of statistical power and
blinding of outcome assessors. Two had an unclear risk of bias due to limitedinformation provided about the methodology (Brubaker & Fowler, 1990 ;
Sanderson & Jemmott, 1996 ). While risk of bias is not atypical for social
psychology studies from the 1990s, current international standards of conduct andreporting of trials advise to not rely heavily on evidence with a high risk of bias(Begg et al., 1996 ). The fourth study (Jemmott et al., 1998 ) shows lower risk of
bias and also provides a longer term outcome at one year. Two of these studies
evaluated interventions which were explicitly based on a combination of SCT
(Bandura, 1997 ) and TPB (Jemmott et al., 1998 ; Sanderson & Jemmott, 1996 )
and in particular drawing on techniques from SCT. Thus, these studies do notprovide a pure test of the TPB.
Most surprisingly, one of the four studies did not find that the TPB intervention
resulted in changes in behaviour (Sanderson & Jemmott, 1996 ; only significant
differences in subgroup analyses) and another study did not find any differencebetween TPB-based and non-TPB-based interventions on any TPB constructs
measured post-test (Brubaker & Fowler, 1990 ). Jemmott et al. ( 1998 ) found short-
term but not long-term effects for one of two outcomes (sexual abstinence) andlonger-term effects for the other outcome (condom use). In two of these fourstudies, the authors explicitly stated doubts in their conclusions about the validityof the TPB. Indeed, Murphy and Brubaker ( 1990 ) concluded that ‘though the
theory-based message was the most effective means of encouraging TSEperformance, the theoretical model does not seem to adequately explain itseffectiveness ’(p. 462). These four studies highlighted as successful application of
the TPB are not particularly convincing examples in support of the theory and if
anything, further highlight its limitations.
Is more research on the TPB needed?
Armitage ’s(2015 ) call for a consolidated programme of research across groups to
conduct additional tests of the TPB offers a radical counter-position to our call fordisinvestment in the theory. He refers to the example of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
project built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research with collaborations from
scientists worldwide. To our mind, the LHC reference might have been somewhatmisleading. The LHC was built to enable the scientific community to test hypotheses thatwere not previously testable in individual laboratories. The recommendations for theutilisation of the TPB in intervention research might be complicated and cumbersome, butthere is nothing in the TPB which would have prevented its testing. Indeed, since oureditorial was published, various authors have told us that they have conductedexperimental tests of the TPB and failed to submit these for publication or received
rejections from journals. We do not share the view of the need for additional TPB-based
interventions, but if such studies are to be conducted, it would help the evidence-baseconsiderably to register these trials and publish protocols prior to data analysis to counterany potential file-drawer issues. While we sympathise with the call for collective action,182 F .F. Sniehotta et al.
the point of our editorial was precisely that given what we know now about the TPB, it
might be time to invest our limited available resources into theoretical approaches whichare in line with current knowledge and/or have higher utility for research and practice.
Retire or extend the TPB?
Some commentators argued that many of the problems of the TPB could be solved or
improved upon by extending rather than retiring the TPB (Ajzen, 2015 ; Conner, 2015 ).
We are grateful for the opportunity to clarify what we perceive to be a possible
misunderstanding. We do agree that the TPB can be extended in a way that circumvents or
weakens some of the criticisms we summarised. However, cumulative science requires a
clearly defined theory core and modifications should result in changes in the formulationof the TPB. For a viable extension of a theory, authors should first formalise the extendedtheory, or a version or variant of a theory (cf. Rhodes, 2015 ) and then test it. Once an
extended or modified theory is shown to be superior, its predecessor can be retired. Theestablished knowledge specified in the predecessor theory is thus inherently embodied inthe extended theory. Through clear theory formulation and rigorous testing we could
achieve more rapid progress and, using the words of Hall ( 2015 ), the intermediate more-
likely-to-be-forgotten-than-forced-to-retire theories would make a considerable and lastingcontribution to the understanding of human behaviour. Five types of extensions have beendiscussed.
First, the TPB can be extended by splitting its explanatory variables into sub-
components, e.g., attitudes into affective and cognitive attitudes (Ajzen, 2015 ; Conner,
2015 ). This extension is mostly relevant for correlational studies that aim to improve the
statistical predictive utility of the theory; it might be less relevant for intervention studiesassuming that most applications of the TPB to intervention development would addressboth kinds of attitudes. Such extensions do not conflict with any of the main TPBhypotheses. However, they would not address any of the criticisms we listed about the TPBeither.
Second, one can extend the TPB by adding variables external to the theory (Conner,
2015 ). Such an extension would involve the identification of variables outside the TPB
which consistently and across a range of applications add explanatory power. Such anextension would violate its sufficiency hypothesis and would conflict with its mathem-atical foundations. If the scientific community agreed that there is evidence supportingsuch an extension, this could support the case for retiring the TPB in favour of TPB plus‘x’. This would ensure that in science, education and practice, the agreed knowledge is
provided by a state-of-the-art theory. Head and Noar ( 2014 ; Noar & Head, 2014 ) provide
an excellent discussion of the difficulties and opportunities in developing such an
extension.
Third, one can extend the TPB by adding mediation hypotheses, often in combination
with one of the previous two options. One of the best-researched examples concerns therole of anticipated regret as an additional predictor in the TPB. A systematic review withmeta-analysis (Sandberg & Conner, 2008 ) concluded that anticipated regret predicts
intention over and above attitude, subjective norm and PBC and predicts behaviour over
and above intention and PBC. The nature of these arguments precisely and remarkably
resembles the arguments that led to the retirement of the theory of reasoned action (TRA;Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975 ). In both developments, one additional variable was added which
was hypothesised to explain both intention and behaviour independently of theHealth Psychology Review 183
explanatory variables in the theory. In the case of adding PBC, this led to a retirement of
the TRA and the emergence of the TPB (Ajzen, 1985 ). However, in the case of
anticipated regret, it led to absolutely no consequences in the development of the TPB.
Fourth, and probably more relevant for intervention research, is the identification of
moderators within the TPB (Conner, 2015 ). Understanding the circumstances under
which theoretical hypotheses apply is relevant to shape the set of intended applications of
a theory and to formulate hypotheses for experimental research. Any consistent moderator
evident across applications would help to develop theory in a meaningful way. Abraham
(2015 ) highlights the utility of conducting a theory-informed needs assessment prior to
theory selection. To make the most of such an assessment, it would be important to
understand the circumstances under which theoretical hypotheses and explanations apply.
Ajzen ( 2015 ) and Armitage ( 2015 ) suggest that the TPB is less useful in those who are
already motivated, which highlights an inherent range of intended application of the TPB.
Finally, the TPB variables have been integrated in other theoretical approaches
(Hagger, 2009 ), as a motivational component together with volitional self-regulatory
approaches such as planning (Armitage, 2015 ; Darker, French, Eves, & Sniehotta, 2010 ;
Schwarzer, 2015 ) or as a reflective process in reflective/impulsive dual process models
(Armitage, 2015 ; Presseau et al., 2014 ; Sheeran, Gollwitzer, & Bargh, 2013 ; Strack &
Deutsch, 2004 ). These applications presume that the TPB as a theory of human behaviour
is insufficient, but they make use of the knowledge we have gathered over past decades
about TPB constructs. This demonstrates that it is possible to move on to more evolvedtheories without forgetting or dismissing what research using the TPB has taught us.
Extending theory is an important option for progress in behaviour change science.
The research strategy of extending the TPB is not new (Conner & Armitage, 1998 ) but
has so far failed to progress the theory. Most promising extensions conflict with the TPB
and it is no longer helpful to acknowledge these limitations without modifying the formal
theory (Head & Noar, 2014 ).
How can we progress theory more effectively?
Most of the commentators agreed with the main premise of our editorial. Yet, they describe
it as courageous (Schwarzer, 2015 ), bold (Hall, 2015 ) and even harsh (Armitage, 2015 ).
There is no harshness implied. As both Hall ( 2015 ) and Rhodes ( 2015 ) emphasised, it is a
badge of honour for a theory if peers discuss its retirement. It implies that the theory hadonce been a standard, previously setting a benchmark for the field. However, the TPB is no
longer a defensible or useful standard and de facto, large proportions of the field have
moved on as reflected by the majority of commentaries. Even Ajzen ( 2015 ) acknowledges
that the prediction of behaviour from intention and PBC is ‘fraught with potential
problems ’(p. x). This debate resembles key motives described in the emperor ’s new
clothes: everybody sees the problem but we have created a culture of not calling it what itis. Scientific debate benefits the field and should not by any means be perceived as
personal.
This debate has illustrated the appetite for re-establishing momentum in the
development of behavioural theory (Hall, 2015 ). A few encouraging implications transpire
as follows.184 F .F. Sniehotta et al.
Accelerating cycles for theory innovation
Stagnation in theorising is not in the interest of a science that seeks to understand a
phenomenon as important and exciting as human behaviour. An acceleration ofinnovation cycles is required. Behaviour change science should not be too conservativeand risk averse. It would be helpful to give new, creative hypotheses and theories achance in the peer review system (cf. Hall, 2015 ; Rhodes, 2015 ). It seems likely that
those who have experience with interventions in practice and research could makeinvaluable contributions in translating their experience in novel theoretical hypotheses. Itwould help to demand that any new theories clearly define the theory core and range of
intended applications (see Table 1 ). Any new theory suggesting new hypotheses that can
be tested against hypotheses from established theories should be embraced (Noar &Zimmerman, 2005 ). To make a significant contribution to the field, a theory does not
need to explain all behaviours. Theories with more specific scope, for example,explaining aspects of behavioural maintenance or multiple behaviour change wouldcreate considerable progress in research and practice.
Rigorous experimental tests
In the past, theorising was often dominated by a correlational mind-set. Before moving to
experimental studies, health psychologists frequently conducted a programme ofcorrelational research to identify promising variables for experimental studies. There isa risk that correlational thinking can hinder theory development. Viable theoretical ideasmight not be brought to experimental tests because they fail the insufficient correlational
test of their incremental predictive utility over and above a standard theory (see Trafimow,
2015 ). The key question for health behaviour theory is not how many predictors one
needs to predict behaviour; the key question is what to do to bring about change. Healthbehaviour theory should be able to explain how combinations or sequences of behaviourchange strategies can be optimised, how interventions can be matched to individualfeatures and how one prioritises and/or sequences strategies in behaviour changeinterventions. These answers are more likely to come from intervention research using arange of methods such as factorial designs (Staunton, Gellert, Knittle, & Sniehotta, in
press); N-of-1 randomised controlled trials (Sniehotta, Presseau, Hobbs, & Araújo-Soares,
2012 ) or between subject RCTs with process evaluation (Gillison et al., 2015 ). Based on
an experimental approach, evidence about the viability of the theory or hypothesis willemerge more quickly, thereby allowing the field to move forward (Hall, 2015 ).
Theory development as a social consensus process
The emergence, popularity and decline of a theory do not only depend on empirical
evidence. Theories differ so much in the nature of their explanation that it is not alwayspossible to directly compare evidence. It might be helpful to understand the evolution oftheory as a complex social process where groups explicitly or implicitly agree on certainstandards. Scholars may become affiliated with a theory because they have developed theexpertise and track record around that theory and because this expertise has been
influential for their previous success. Not all researchers will agree about the empirical
validity of theories and we have no intention to limit freedom of choice. Mostbehavioural research is funded by the tax payer and the tax payer expects scientists tostrive for improvement and innovation. It might be worth reflecting on the degree towhich it is beneficial to build research programmes and research careers on a single un-Health Psychology Review 185
adapted theory. It might create a disincentive for embracing progress. The field of health
behaviour change seems to have accepted the principle of ownership of theories. We owethe originators of the theories we use gratitude, but as a scientific community we need toaccept responsibility for the development of these theories. If we sit back, watch and wait
for the originator to decide where to go with the theory, we lose control over the progress
of our science.
Theories and methods for intervention development
Translational evidence-based science covers the process from discovery to application
(and back to discovery; Craig et al., 2008 ). While the three previous points addressed the
discovery end of the process, the relevance of behaviour change science depends on the
degree to which the knowledge gathered through basic and applied research can feed intoeducation and application. A theory that inspires researchers to test novel hypotheses hasits important place in the process but might not necessarily be as useful as a theory thatguides intervention development. A useful theory to guide intervention development andevaluation in practice will be measured by its ability to reflect what is known about keyprinciples of behaviour change and to inform decisions about inclusion, exclusion,tailoring and sequencing of theory-based behaviour change strategies and evaluation
protocols which capture the hypothesised theoretical mechanisms (Abraham, 2015 ;
Moore et al., 2014 ).
Concluding remarks
Many disciplines are involved in behaviour change, and many of them share the methods
and approaches that psychologists use. Among the unique contributions of psychology isthe depth of theoretical understanding of behaviour and behaviour change. There is a riskof floundering in the habitual use of outdated theories while losing this core strength ofthe discipline. But the future is bright: new integrative theories are emerging with authorsthat encourage and embrace real and lasting adaptation. Developing accurate andsufficiently comprehensive models of health behaviour is therefore an imperative that
has implications for behavioural research, education and practice. The outside world is
increasingly interested in –and indeed waiting for –these models. The scientific
community collectively holds a great deal of responsibility to do their very best tooptimise methods of theory development in a way that mirrors recent improvements inmethods for the development, reporting and evaluation of interventions (Bartholomewet al., 2011 ; Craig et al., 2008 ; Davidson et al., 2003 ; Hoffman et al., 2014 ; Moore
et al., 2014 ).
We remain committed to our suggestion that it is time to retire the TPB. However,
given the apparent level of disagreement on how to interpret the science around the TPB
and the adamant commitment of its proponents to the theory, there is a chance that we
will retire before the TPB does. That is a healthy indicator of a pluralistic scientificcommunity. We are confident, however, that the majority of the field has and willcontinue to move forward and embrace an agenda of evidence-based and theoreticallygrounded science and practice of behaviour change.
