Objective :Reporting guidelines call for descriptions of control group support
in equal detail as for interventions. However, how to assess the active content
(behaviour change techniques (BCTs)) of treatment-as-usual (TAU) deliveredto control groups in trials remains unclear. The objective of this study is topre-test a method of assessing TAU in a multicentre cost-effectiveness trial of
an HIV-treatment adherence intervention.
Design :HIV-nurses ( N= 21) completed a semi-structured open-ended
questionnaire enquiring about TAU adherence counselling. Two codersindependently coded BCTs.
Main outcome measures :Completeness and clarity of nurse responses, inter-
coder reliabilities and the type of BCTs reported were examined.Results :The clarity and completeness of nurse responses were adequate.
Twenty-three of the 26 identi ﬁed BCTs could be reliably coded (mean
κ= .79; mean agreement rate = 96%) and three BCTs scored below κ= .60.
Total number of BCTs reported per nurse ranged between 7 and 19(M= 13.86, SD = 3.35).
Conclusions :This study suggests that the TAU open-ended questionnaire is a
feasible and reliable tool to capture active content of support provided to con-trol participants in a multicentre adherence intervention trial. Considerable var-iability in the number of BCTs provided to control patients was observed,
illustrating the importance of reliably collecting and accurately reporting con-
trol group support.

Introduction
Health behaviour change interventions are usually multifaceted, and may include a
range of active ingredients commonly referred to as behaviour change techniques
(BCTs, Abraham, Kelly, West, & Michie, 2009 ; Abraham & Michie, 2008 ;

Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, Gottlieb, & Fernandez, 2011 ; Michie et al., 2013 ). Poor
intervention descriptions in research protocols and published study reports often pre-clude inferring which BCTs where delivered, why and how, which poses a major barrierto intervention replication, implementation and the conduct of informative systematic
reviews (De Bruin, Viechtbauer, Hospers, Schaalma, & Kok,
2009 ; McCleary, Duncan,
Stewart, & Francis, 2013 ). In the last decade, researchers have therefore paid consider-
able attention to improving the quality of intervention descriptions in randomised con-trolled trials (RCTs, Abraham, Johnson, De Bruin, & Luszczynska,
2014 ; Abraham &
Michie, 2008 ; Albrecht, Archibald, Arseneau, & Scott, 2013 ; Boutron, Moher, Altman,
Schulz, & Ravaud, 2008 ; Des Jarlais, Lyles, & Crepaz, 2004 ; Hoffmann et al., 2014 ;
Michie et al., 2013 ; Zwarenstein et al., 2008 ). Considerably less attention has been
paid, however, to improving descriptions of the support provided to control groups in
behaviour change intervention trials, who typically received treatment-as-usual (TAU)
or an augmented version thereof. (Burns, 2009 ; Burns et al., 2007 ; De Bruin et al.,
2009 ; Freedland, Mohr, Davidson, & Schwartz, 2011 ; Löfholm, Brännström, Olsson, &
Hansson, 2013 ; Wagner & Kanouse, 2003 ). Yet, systematic reviews and meta-analyses
suggest that the active content of TAU can vary considerably between trials. Impor-tantly, the quality of TAU can in ﬂuence outcomes in control groups, and thus trial
effect sizes (Ayling, Brierley, Johnson, Heller, & Eiser,
2015 ; Bishop, Fenge-Davies,
Kirby, & Geraghty, 2015 ; De Bruin et al., 2009 ; De Bruin et al., 2010a ).
Guidelines such as CONSORT, WIDER and TIDieR call for control group descrip-
tions in equal detail as intervention content (Albrecht et al., 2013 ; Boutron et al., 2008 ;
Hoffmann et al., 2014 ; Zwarenstein et al., 2008 ). However, no information is given on
how to obtain these data, or summarise TAU data for reporting when it is collectedfrom multiple sources (e.g. health care professionals and/or study sites). Consequently,study reports rarely include any detail about the active content of care provided tocontrol groups (Ayling et al.,
2015 ; De Bruin et al., 2009 ; De Bruin et al., 2010a ;
Freedland et al., 2011 ; Oberjé, De Kinderen, Evers, Van Woerkum, & De Bruin, 2013 ;
Schoenwald et al., 2011 ), which can lead to inaccurate conclusions about intervention
effectiveness and their most effective ingredients (De Bruin et al., 2009 ; De Bruin
et al., 2010a ).
Accurately describing the active content of behaviour change counselling in TAU
can be challenging, especially in the context of RCTs with ﬁnancial and time con-
straints. Several direct and indirect methods are available to explore the content ofpatient –clinician counselling (Erlen et al.,
2014 ; Hrisos et al., 2009 ). Direct methods,
such as video- or audio-taped observations, can provide accurate re ﬂections of care con-
tent, but can be biased if both the patient and provider are aware of being observed
(Peabody, Luck, Glassman, Dresselhaus, & Lee, 2000 ; Wilson & McDonald, 1994 ).
Observing clinical interactions, as well as other direct methods such as unannounced‘standardised ’or‘simulated ’patients, can therefore be prone to measurement effects
(Luck & Peabody,
2002 ; Van Zanten, Boulet, Norcini, & McKinley, 2004 ). Moreover,
considerable resources are required for coding a representative number of consultationsper clinician, and these costs rapidly escalate when many clinicians provide TAU tocontrol group patients. Using direct methods to capture TAU provided to control groups
may thus not be feasible in intervention research (Hrisos et al.,
2009 ). Care content can
also be investigated indirectly using proxy measures, such as closed-ended standard carechecklists (De Bruin et al.,
2009 ), or patient vignettes (Hughes & Huby, 2002 ). Despite898 E.J.M. Oberjé et al.
their low-response burden, indirect measures may overestimate the active content of
care by promoting social desirability bias (Fisher, 1993 ; Peabody et al., 2004 ; Spies,
Mokkink, De Vries Robbé, & Grol, 2004 ). Given the limitations of available methods,
it may be useful to explore other options.
In this study, a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire was pilot-tested to assess
the quality of usual medication adherence care delivered to control groups. The TAUopen-ended questionnaire is an alternative for available methods, as it potentiallyexplores TAU more feasibly (less time required and less costly to use) than direct meth-ods, and more accurately than other indirect methods (no social desirability bias as thequestions are minimally suggestive/cueing). The TAU open-ended questionnaire wasused in a multicentre RCT examining the (cost-) effectiveness of the Adherence Improv-ing self-Management Strategy (AIMS intervention) compared to TAU among HIV-
infected patients using combination antiretroviral therapy (De Bruin, Hospers, Van den
Borne, Kok, & Prins,
2005 ; De Bruin et al., 2010b , Oberjé et al., 2013 ). In the current
study, four research questions were explored: (1) Is it feasible to use the TAU open-ended questionnaire in the context of a large RCT? (2) Are TAU descriptions suf ﬁ-
ciently detailed to allow for BCT coding? (3) Can BCTs be reliably coded based on theTAU descriptions? (4) What is the variability between nurses and between clinics in thetotal number of BCTs reported?
Methods
Setting
Seven HIV-clinics in the Netherlands, with in total 21 HIV-nurses, participated in the
AIMS-study: Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam (7 nurses); Slotervaart Hospital,Amsterdam (3 nurses); St. Lucas-Andreas Hospital, Amsterdam (2 nurses); Leiden
University Medical Centre, Leiden (2 nurses); HAGA Hospital, The Hague (2 nurses);
Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam (3 nurses); and Isala Clinic, Zwolle (2 nurses). Thenurses were asked to ﬁll in the paper-and-pencil version of the TAU open-ended
questionnaire during a meeting prior to the start of the AIMS study.
TAU open-ended questionnaire
The TAU open-ended questionnaire contained semi-structured open-ended questions
with free text for nurse responses. In order to increase the probability that all relevant
elements of the TAU were reported, rather than using a single question (e.g. ‘Please
report all the things you do to support adherence among your patients ’) multiple ques-
tions were used as ‘probes ’. The content of these questions was guided by a previously
developed HIV-treatment adherence taxonomy of BCTs; and by the results of a system-atic review of HIV-treatment adherence trials that included TAU data collected fromstudy authors using a standard care checklist (De Bruin et al.,
2009 ; De Bruin et al.,
2010a ). The questions in the current open questionnaire re ﬂect the broad categories in
which adherence support is typically delivered: informing patients, motivating patients,
goal setting, problem solving, and it makes a distinction between activities that are typi-cally done during the start-up of a treatment (e.g. providing information and make amedication intake plan) and those that are more likely to be delivered during follow-upPsychology & Health 899
sessions (e.g. identify adherence problems and solutions). Table 1shows the open-
ended questions used, and one additional question to enquire whether any adherence-related activities were delivered not covered by these questions. The questionnaire wasdistributed in Dutch. The original TAU open-ended questionnaire with instructions for
respondents included is also available online as supplementary material.
The nurses were instructed (both verbally and in an introductory text) to report on
the activities that they ‘routinely deliver to the majority of their patients ’, rather than
occasional activities to speci ﬁc individual cases. The nurses were also instructed, both
verbally and on paper, to describe each activity, strategy or method in as much detail aspossible. For instance, they were instructed that ‘motivational interviewing ’would be
too non-concrete, and that they had to describe concretely what activities they were per-forming to support adherence. The researchers were present during completion of the
questionnaire to answer possible questions from the nurses.
Coding procedure
Two authors (EO and MdB) independently coded the adherence support activities
reported by nurses. Disagreements were resolved in a consensus meeting. A codingmanual was used to determine which standard care activities could be considered asBCTs. The questions and the coding manual were developed based on the same
adherence-adapted BCT taxonomy. It includes 38 items that describe distinct adherence-
enhancing BCTs. This 38-item adherence to medication taxonomy is an adapted versionof the behaviour change taxonomy from intervention mapping (Bartholomew et al.,
2011 ) and Abraham and Michie ( 2008 ). The taxonomy is available on the Open Science
Framework ( https://osf.io/zdi5q/ ). The coders included one additional BCT (a 39th) in

the manual to capture the relevant adherence supporting activity ‘reducing psychologi-
cal barriers ’. All coded BCTs were given one point each. BCTs that were reported both
at treatment-initiation and for follow-up meetings were given two points.
Analyses
The analyses were performed in four steps. First, to assess feasibility of the TAU open-
ended questionnaire, we examined time to complete the questionnaire, the amount ofmissing data and the extent to which nurses required help to complete the questionnaire.Second, to assess completeness and clarity of responses, we examined whether TAUdescriptions were detailed enough to allow for BCT coding. The open-ended questionswere compared to each other to assess whether some questions were more likely to
yield ambiguous descriptions of TAU activities than others. Examples of descriptions
with adequate and inadequate level of detail were given. Third, to assess whether BCTswere reliably coded, Cohen ’s kappa statistic was used to examine the intercoder reliabil-
ity of each BCT. Fourth, to assess variability in TAU between nurses and betweenclinics, the total number of reported BCTs was computed.
Results
Participants
All nurses returned their questionnaire ( N= 21). Their mean age was 44 years
(SD = 8.46), 15 participants were female, and all nurses were Dutch. Two nurses hadless than one year nursing experience and six nurses had more than 10 years nursingexperience ( M= 7.81, SD = 6.35). All nurses completed higher vocational nursing edu-
cation and six nurses completed post-graduate education for ‘Advanced Nursing Practi-
tioner ’. Nineteen nurses completed the (compulsory) three-day course ‘Motivational
Interviewing ’. Most nurses reported that they participated in updates of ‘Motivational
Interviewing ’or other courses not directly related to adherence support (e.g. counselling
and health behaviour change).
Feasibility
The nurses were given 60 min to complete the adherence TAU open-ended question-
naire. All nurses ﬁnished well on time (range = 25 –45 min) and responded to all ques-
tions. After being instructed about how to respond to the TAU open-questions, thenurses did not solicit any further help except for two nurses requesting clari ﬁcation on
one item (question #4). Apparently, the concept of thinking about how to formulategoals was new to these nurses. The responses to question #7, which was added toenquire whether nurses delivered any adherence-related activities that were not alreadycovered by questions #1 –6, were generally brief and produced very little additional
relevant information.
Descriptions of TAU activities
A preliminary qualitative analysis of responses was conducted to assess completeness
and clarity of responses. Most parts of the responses were suf ﬁciently concrete, so thatPsychology & Health 901
BCTs could be easily identi ﬁed. However, there were also sections of text where the
coders had the impression that one or multiple BCTs might have been delivered, butthe level of detail was insuf ﬁcient to con ﬁdently code BCTs. These suboptimal TAU
descriptions were also the main reason for disagreement between the coders, and
seemed to occur more frequently with questions #1, #5 and #6; and more often with
some nurses who tended to formulate their responses at a less concrete level.
An example of text that was unclear is ‘we make a plan together and we evaluate
the plan ’. This suggests that the BCT ‘review of general and/or speci ﬁc goals ’was
delivered. However, the text could not be coded with con ﬁdence because it did not ade-
quately ﬁt the de ﬁnition ‘reconsideration of previously set goals or intentions following
previous goal setting, and an attempt to act on those goals ’. An example of text that
was adequate to code as this BCT is ‘we talk about the patient ’s daily activities and the
agreed time of the day to take medication. In addition, we evaluate why this time of
the day was chosen, and how it works for the patient. In case it does not work well, welook for alternatives ’.
A second example of text that was unclear is ‘I recommend several tools ’, which is
likely to refer to tools such as an alarm device. This suggests that the BCT ‘use of
cues’was delivered but –again –the text could not be coded with con ﬁdence because
it did not adequately ﬁt the de ﬁnition (i.e. ‘teaching or stimulating the patient to iden-
tify environmental prompts that can be used to remind them of the behaviour and/or
goal set ’). An example of text that was adequate to code as this BCT is ‘I advise the
patient to use an alarm device on their mobile phone to remind themselves to takemedication ’.
Aﬁnal example of text that was unclear is ‘I discuss medication intake with the
patient ’. This suggests that the BCT ‘self-report of behaviour ’was delivered (note:
‘self-report of behaviour ’is an assessment technique, not an actual change technique).
However, the text could not be coded with con ﬁdence because it did not adequately ﬁt
the de ﬁ
nition ‘assessment of own adherence behaviour through self-report ’. An example
of text that was adequate to code as this BCT is ‘I ask how many times the patient
skipped a dose or took medication too late, and why ’.
Intercoder reliabilities
Intercoder reliabilities were examined for the identi ﬁcation of 38 BCTs. These are pre-
sented in Table 2, with the percentage of agreement for each BCT and by how many
nurses the BCT was reported. In 13 of the 38 BCTs, both coders agreed that there were
no instances of a BCT in any of the questionnaires. For three of the 38 BCTs, there
was 100% agreement between coders judging that the BCT was present. For theremaining 22 BCTs, kappa scores ranged from .0 to 1.0 with a mean of .79 and a med-ian value of .86 (SD = .26). Nineteen of the 22 tests (86%) produced a satisfactorykappa above .6, which is considered as substantial inter-coder reliability (Landis &Koch,
1977 ). Three tests produced a kappa below .6 (i.e. ‘persuasive argument, belief
selection ’,‘provide general information ’and‘review of general and/or speci ﬁc goals ’).
Across all 38 BCTs, agreement rates ranged from 71 to 100% with a mean value of
97% and a median value of 99% (SD = 5.96).902 E.J.M. Oberjé et al.

‘social in ﬂuence ’(i.e.‘provide information about peer behaviour ’,‘provide opportuni-
ties for social comparison ’and‘mobilise social norm ’) and ‘maintenance ’(i.e.‘formu-
late goals for maintenance of behaviour ’and‘relapse prevention ’). The total number of
BCTs reported on nurse level ranged from 7 to 19 BCTs ( M= 13.86, SD = 3.35). The
average number of BCTs in the seven clinics involved in the AIMS study ranged from9.67 to 16.50 BCTs ( M= 14.00, SD = 2.62). The number of BCTs reported was unre-
lated to age ( r=−.06, 95% CI [ −.41, .32]) and the years of nursing experience
(r= .28, 95% CI [ −.15, .62]). The results from the independent sample t tests indicated
that male nurses ( M= 13.50, SD = 3.88, N= 6) reported an equal number of BCTs
compared to female nurses ( M= 14.00, SD = 3.25, N= 15), t(19) = −.30, p= .76, two
tailed, 95% CI [ −3.97, 2.97]. Nurses who completed post-graduate education
(M= 14.40, SD = 3.42, N= 6) reported also an equal number of BCTs compared to
those who did not complete post-graduate education ( M= 12.50, SD = 3.02, N= 15),
t(19) = 1.19, p= .25, two tailed, 95% CI [ −1.45, 5.25].
Discussion
Although CONSORT, WIDER and TIDieR statements call for control group descrip-
tions in equal detail as intervention content (Albrecht et al.,
2013 ; Boutron et al.,
2008 ; Hoffmann et al., 2014 ; Zwarenstein et al., 2008 ), no guidance is given on
how to obtain these data. The objective of this study was to pilot-test an open-ended questionnaire to reliably assess BCTs delivered by HIV-nurses as part of theirroutinely delivered adherence support. The results suggest that using the TAU open-ended questionnaire is feasible (i.e. nurses understood the questions and the ques-tionnaire could be completed in a reasonable amount of time) and that most of theresponses could be reliably coded with a BCT taxonomy. The results are alsopotentially relevant for interpreting the effects of this trial, which evaluates the
(cost-) effectiveness of the AIMS intervention (De Bruin et al.,
2005 ; De Bruin
et al., 2010b , Oberjé et al., 2013 ), given the variability between nurses and clinics
in the number and type of BCTs delivered. This study suggests therefore that usinga semi-structured open-ended questionnaire with the right instructions and the rightprompts can be an appropriate method for assessing the active content of TAU, andthus improve trial reports and meta-analyses.
Twenty-six BCTs were identi ﬁed from TAU descriptions of 21 nurses, 23 of which
had kappa scores of .60 or above. Three BCTs scored lower than .60. Both coders
agreed that some of the nurse responses were insuf ﬁciently detailed to allow for con ﬁ-
dent BCT coding, which was also a reason for low agreement rates and low kappascores. Researchers who intend to use this method in their trials may consider severaloptions for improvement, such as improving the instructions to respondents to ensurean adequate level of detail of responses; or immediate coding of the completed ques-tionnaires and asking for clari ﬁcation of nurse responses when they are too general.
Recent meta-analyses examined the variability and impact of TAU provided to con-
trol groups in RCTs evaluating HIV-treatment adherence interventions (De Bruin et al.,
2009 ; De Bruin et al., 2010a ). De Bruin and colleagues assessed TAU using a checklist
that was completed by study authors, and found that TAU capacity scores (i.e. a sum-
score of the number of TAU BCTs delivered in each study, weighed for tailoring and906 E.J.M. Oberjé et al.
repetition of BCT delivery) can vary considerably between studies, impact control
group outcomes and consequently trial effect sizes. The results from the current studysuggest that the active content of TAU within one multicentre RCT can vary substan-tially, despite that nurses have the same guidelines, follow the same courses and so
forth. This variance may be explained by factors such as the degree to which the man-
agement thinks providing adherence support is a priority and the amount of trainingreceived, nursing experience, or the quality and amount of training nurses received(Blegen, Vaughn, & Goode,
2001 ; Kane, Shamliyan, Mueller, Duval, & Wilt, 2007 ).
This also raises the question of how this TAU variability can be taken into account inthe analysis of this trial, and in future meta-analyses of behaviour change interventionsthat aim to control for variability in TAU in order to arrive at more accurate estimatesof intervention effects, and the most effective BCTs. To facilitate the use of these data
in such analyses, we recommend that reports of behaviour change interventions include
(either in the manuscript or as an appendix) a table detailing for each TAU providerwhich BCTs had been coded (similar to Table
3in this manuscript).
This study also has some limitations. First, despite that the questions are minimally
directive, the nurse responses might not accurately represent TAU. Examining conver-gent validity (e.g. by comparing questionnaire responses with coded video or audioobservations) and predictive validity (e.g. by comparing TAU scores with adherenceand/or clinical outcomes) would be important steps for future research. Second, we did
not have the opportunity to repeat the same measurement procedure –under the same
conditions –within a short period of time. We were therefore unable to examine
test-retest reliability.
Results from the TAU open-ended questionnaire can also have practical implications
that go beyond improving the reporting of the care provided to control groups. Byexamining the relationship between the active content of TAU and patient outcomes,such as adherence and plasma viral load, the most effective (combinations of) BCTscan be identi ﬁed for supporting adherence. Results from such studies –if suf ﬁciently
rigorously conducted –can be informative for in HIV-nurses ’training programmes to
improve the effectiveness of their TAU.
To conclude, the current study makes primarily a methodological contribution to
improved reporting of the active content of care provided to control groups in trialsevaluating behaviour change interventions. The TAU open-ended questionnaire demon-strates good feasibility to collect data at the level that can be reliably coded with ataxonomy of BCTs. Further validation of data collected in this way would strengthenconﬁdence in the accuracy of these data, and lead to improved trial reports and
analyses, and evidence syntheses.
