Abstract
Background: Using frameworks such as the Behaviour Change Wheel to develop behaviour change interventions
can be challenging because judgement is needed at various points in the process and it is not always clear how
uncertainties can be resolved. We propose a transparent and systematic three-phase process to transition from a
research evidence base to a behaviour change intervention. The three phases entail evidence synthesis, stakeholder
involvement and decision-making. We present the systematic development of an intervention to enhance the
quality of psychological treatment delivered by telephone, as a worked example of this process.
Method: In phase 1 (evidence synthesis), we propose that the capabilities (C), opportunities (O) and motivations
(M) model of behaviour change (COM-B) can be used to support the synthesis of a varied corpus of empirical
evidence and to identify domains to be included in a proposed behaviour change intervention. In phase
2 (stakeholder involvement), we propose that formal consensus procedures (e.g. the RAND Health/University of
California-Los Angeles Appropriateness Methodology) can be used to facilitate discussions of proposed domains
with stakeholder groups. In phase 3 (decision-making), we propose that behavioural scientists identify (with public/
patient input) intervention functions and behaviour change techniques using the acceptability, practicability,
effectiveness/cost-effectiveness, affordability, safety/side-effects and equity (APEASE) criteria.

Results: The COM-B model was a useful tool that allowed a multidisciplinary research team, many of whom had no
prior knowledge of behavioural science, to synthesise effectively a varied corpus of evidence (phase 1: evidence
synthesis). The RAND Health/University of California-Los Angeles Appropriateness Methodology provided a
transparent means of involving stakeholders (patients, practitioners and key informants in the present example), a
structured way in which they could identify which of 93 domains identified in phase 1 were essential for inclusion
in the intervention (phase 2: stakeholder involvement). Phase 3 (decision-making) was able to draw on existing
Behaviour Change Wheel resources to revisit phases 1 and 2 and facilitate agreement among behavioural scientists
on the final intervention modules. Behaviour changes were required at service, practitioner, patient and community
levels.
Conclusion: Frameworks offer a foundation for intervention development but require additional elucidation at
each stage of the process. The decisions adopted in this study are designed to provide an example on how to
resolve challenges while designing a behaviour change intervention. We propose a three-phase process, which
represents a transparent and systematic framework for developing behaviour change interventions in any setting.

Introduction
The Behaviour Change Wheel [ 1] is a systematic method
that is endorsed as a key theoretical framework by the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
[2] for the development and evaluation of behaviour
change interventions. The Behaviour Change Wheel [ 1]
makes explicit many of the processes involved in the de-
velopment of behaviour change interventions, the start-
ing point for which is understanding the behaviour (e.g.
identifying what needs to change), followed by identify-
ing intervention options and identifying content. The
Behaviour Change Wheel [ 1] also provides tools for ne-
gotiating each of these phases of intervention develop-
ment. For example, the capabilities (C, physical and
psychological), opportunities (O, physical and social) and
motivations (M, automatic and reflective) model of be-
haviour (B: COM-B) captures the key drivers of behav-
iour that may need to change, and APEASE articulates
the criteria (acceptability, practicability, effectiveness/
cost-effectiveness, affordability, safety/side-effects andequity) by which decisions about intervention content
(e.g. mode of delivery) should be made [ 1].
However, the operative word in relation to the Behav-
iour Change Wheel [ 1]i smethod , and although the Be-
haviour Change Wheel suggests a series of broad steps
to follow in developing interventions it is not a ‘magic
bullet ’([1]: p.27). This means that every step in the
process of intervention development is not prescribed
and that developers need to ‘be comfortable using judge-
ment ’([1]: p.125) to decide what suits best for the con-
text. There is currently a lack of worked examples of
how to identify and then negotiate the likely numerous
points at which judgement is needed to develop coher-
ent and effective interventions. This is important, be-
cause there are numerous examples of the Behaviour
Change Wheel [ 1] being used to develop interventions
that lack of transparency in how key decisions were
made. For example, although Barker et al. [ 3] rigorously
apply the Behaviour Change Wheel [ 1], it is not clear
how they synthesised their varied corpus of evidence to
arrive at their final intervention ( ‘we then combined …’,
p. 491). The lack of specified opportunities for stake-
holder involvement, a core philosophy of contemporary
health care [ 4], has been acknowledged as a specific
weakness in the implementation of the Behaviour
Change Wheel approach [ 5].
Aims
The aim of this paper is to propose a transparent and
systematic process for intervention development: (1) evi-
dence synthesis, how to bring together evidence from
multiple sources; (2) stakeholder involvement, how to
incorporate stakeholder perspectives on the evidence
base; and (3) decision making, how to resolve contradic-
tions in the evidence base and/or stakeholderFaija et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:53 Page 2 of 11
perspectives (see Fig. 1). We describe how the transition
from empirical evidence (evidence synthesis) to the de-
velopment of behaviour change intervention materials
(decision-making) can be negotiated, considering key
stakeholder priorities (stakeholder involvement).
Our worked-example reports on each phase of the de-
velopment of a behaviour change intervention designed
to enhance the quality of psychological interventions de-
livered by telephone (EQUITy research programme).
Mental health problems are affecting an increasing num-
ber of people [ 6] and a critical step in maximising the
availability, accessibility and cost-effectiveness of
evidence-based mental healthcare is to develop and im-
plement high quality, safe alternatives to face-to-face
treatment. Although meta-analysis, randomised trials
and large observational studies have shown telephone-
delivered psychological interventions to be clinically and
cost-effective compared to face-to-face delivery [ 7–9],
their routine uptake in practice and their sustained use
by patients has lagged behind this evidence [ 10,11].
Qualitative enquiry has shown the root of this delay to
be a multifaceted problem, driven not just by the behav-
iour of patients themselves, but also by the practitioners
delivering psychological services, and the people who
manage them [ 12–15]. Enhancing the quality of psycho-
logical interventions delivered by telephone thus pro-
vides a rich and contemporary relevant context to
illuminate some of the processes involved in behaviour
change intervention development.
Phase 1: Evidence synthesis
Introduction
Evidence is at the heart of the Behaviour Change Wheel
[1] approach to intervention development, but questions
inevitably arise as to what types of evidence are relevant,
how much of each type of evidence is necessary and
how might intervention developers best prioritise orbring different types of evidence together. We have la-
belled the first phase of the development of our worked-
example intervention ‘evidence synthesis ’. Evidence syn-
thesis may be required at each phase of intervention de-
velopment specified in the Behaviour Change Wheel [ 1]:
it can be used to identify what needs to change as well
as what modes of delivery might be most effective.
Systematic reviews and meta-analysis are at the top of
the evidence hierarchy [ 16,17] and are extremely useful
when they are available, but they rarely cover every as-
pect of the intervention that needs to be developed (e.g.
from selecting target behaviours to identifying mode of
delivery). Thus, when embarking on intervention devel-
opment, there are often gaps in existing knowledge that
need addressing rapidly. This might mean additional
data collection (qualitative and/or quantitative) and/or
rapid evidence reviews are required to fill gaps in sys-
tematic reviews. However, the challenge is to identify a
structured way in which to synthesise such evidence
from multiple sources that maximises input from people
who may not have a behavioural sciences background,
let alone familiarity with the Behaviour Change Wheel
[1].
Methods
How to bring together evidence from multiple
studies/sources? Ideally, and upholding the central
ethos of evidence-based health care, synthesis would be
achieved by conducting a mixed-methods meta-synthesis
based on published papers. In addition, training stake-
holders in research methods and the Behaviour Change
Wheel so that they could fully and robustly participate
in evidence synthesis would integrate and enable copro-
duction. Often however, intervention needs to be articu-
lated through a lens of tacit demand or more acute
system changes, evidence gaps, publication delays or

funding windows that introduce time pressures into
real-world scenarios. In such situations, judgment is
needed [ 18,19].
Table 1summarises the steps needed to negotiate the
evidence synthesis phase, alongside suggestions as to how
to strike a balance between the ideal of mixed-methods
meta-synthesis with the realities of intervention develop-
ment. Key features of the process include the idea that the
personnel involved should be as broad as possible and the
recommendation that COM-B be used to help structure
people ’s responses. We have found that COM-B is easily
communicated to non-experts. Additional Files 1,2,3and
4provide a worked example of the approach in relation to
improving quality and engagement on telephone working
and increase likelihood of effective and successful imple-
mentation of an intervention in clinical practice.
Results
What was the output from the evidence synthesis
phase? The evidence synthesis phase resulted in 93 do-
mains of people ’s capabilities, opportunities and motiva-
tions that needed to change to improve delivery of
psychological interventions by telephone (Additional File
5). From the 93 domains, 40 were related to capabilities
(all psychological), 31 to opportunities (18 physical and
13 social) and 22 to motivations (16 reflective and 6
automatic). The target domains involved changes at
practitioner, patient, service and community levels.In brief, changes at a practitioner level included mainly
development/enhancement of telephone-specific skills
(capabilities); changes in negative beliefs and emotions as-
sociated to telephone treatment and acknowledgement of
professional role expectations (motivation). Changes at
patient and community levels were related to increased
knowledge/awareness of the different types of psycho-
logical interventions and its different modes of delivery
(capabilities). Changes at a service level consisted of pro-
viding standardised and clear guidelines on procedures to
deliver psychological treatment by telephone and clarify
drivers for its use (capabilities); adjust working environ-
ment (e.g. reduce noise) (opportunities), ensure resources
(e.g. good quality headsets) (opportunities), provide social
support for working remotely (e.g. assessment and moni-
toring of telephone performance) (opportunities) and con-
tinued professional development (opportunities). The
COM-B domains correspond closely with those that are
articulated in the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)
[20], and evidence analysed using different theoretically
informed approaches was synthesised effectively and the
relevant behaviour change domains identified.
Results of the evidence synthesis meeting were then
cross-validated with broader literature relevant to the
target group, identified prior to progressing to phase 2.
As part of the cross-validation, we generated a list of po-
tential barriers/enablers to behaviour change identified
via a scoping search of previously published literature
conducted by members of the programme team (PB and
KL) (see tables in Additional Files 1and2) and feedback

gathered from clinical work. We included studies fo-
cused on the same target populations (patient, practi-
tioners) and health intervention (telephone-delivered
psychological interventions), irrespective of whether or
not they used a TDF analysis. We then compared our
generated list of extrapolated influences to the specific
evidence we had generated to inform the design of the
intervention. Team consensus considered all potential
influences to be adequately represented by our evidence
synthesis output, and no further additions to our data
set were required.
Phase 2: Stakeholder involvement
Introduction
Patient and public involvement (PPI) plays an active role
in health and social care services and in research, and its
importance is rising [ 4,21]. The Behaviour Change
Wheel approach [ 1] has been criticised for its lack of pa-
tient involvement [ 5]. Involvement of the public is
needed to ensure development and improvement in ser-
vice care is equal, efficient, effective, patient-centred,
relevant and appropriate [ 22–24]. Further to the cross-
validation exercise proposed at the end of phase 1, an
additional sense-checking of these results with multiple
stakeholder groups is necessary. The challenge is to en-
sure that different perspectives have equal contributions
while developing a coherent intervention.
Methods
There are multiple ways in which stakeholders can be in-
volved in the translation of evidence into practice, such as
the Delphi method [ 25], the Nominal Group Technique
[26,27], and the Consensus Development Conference [ 28,
29], but most force participants to achieve consensus [ 30].
Forced consensus may inhibit creativity and lose import-
ant nuance in intervention design. We would therefore
propose an adapted version of the RAND Health/Univer-
sity of California-Los Angeles Appropriateness Method-
ology (RAND/UCLA) [ 31], which does not forceconsensus and provides participants with opportunities to
discuss and change ratings after further considerations.
The RAND/UCLA method usually involves single groups
of experts, but we would advocate adapting the method-
ology by: (a) considering all potential participants as ex-
perts, and (b) running RAND/UCLA exercises separately
for different groups of stakeholders in order to capture the
expertise of all stakeholders without inhibition (e.g. practi-
tioners versus managers). Additional File 6provides de-
tails on recruitment of stakeholders and describes RAND/
UCLA procedures and adaptations.
Table 2summarises the steps needed to negotiate the
stakeholder involvement phase, alongside suggestions as
to how to adapt the RAND/UCLA method to meet this
purpose. Key features of the process include the idea that
the personnel involved should not be restricted to ‘ex-
perts ’, but that different stakeholder groups be treated sep-
arately. Additional File 6provides a worked example of
the approach in relation to improving quality and engage-
ment on telephone working and increase likelihood of ef-
fective and successful implementation of an intervention
in clinical practice. Additional File 7includes demographic
characteristics for the stakeholder groups. Experiences of
stakeholders related to taking part in the meeting are in-
cluded in Additional File 8. A questionnaire aimed to
gather information at the stakeholder meetings on a pro-
posed element of the behaviour change intervention (i.e.
skills training) is included in Additional File 9.
Results
What was the outcome of the stakeholder
involvement phase? At the end of Round 1, ‘extremely
important ’ratings (i.e. Median ≥7) had been given to
90.3% of domains by patients, 84.9% by practitioners and
90.3% by key informants. Following moderated discus-
sion during Round 2, an additional 3.2% and 7.5% do-
mains were rated ‘extremely important ’by patients and
practitioners respectively; no additional domains were

essential ’(i.e. median < 7) are included in Additional File
12b. Experiences from each of the stakeholder groups
about their participation in the meeting are included in
Additional File 13.
Phase 3: Decision-making
Introduction
The principal aims of the decision-making phase are to
(a) address how to resolve any contradictions in the evi-
dence base and/or across stakeholder perspectives, (b)
choose which domains to include in the behaviour
change intervention, (c) identify intervention functions,
(d) propose behaviour change techniques [ 1] and (e) ad-
dress demand while retaining applicability and practical-
ity across diverse health settings/services. Consistent
with the ethos of stakeholder involvement, ideally the
decision-making phase would involve equitable contri-
butions from all partners. However, the reality is that
few intervention development programmes have the op-
portunity to train adequately all the stakeholders.
Methods
In the broader literature [ 32], typically final decisions on
intervention content are made either by the behaviouralscientist on the team or among a small number of mem-
bers of the programme team. Sometimes the results are
circulated and the decisions made for feedback to the
wider team. With the luxury of time, key stakeholders
could be trained and a larger-scale decision-making meet-
ing could be held. Table 3provides details on decision-
making procedures, divided into what would ideally be
done, possible compromises that could be made alongside
some concrete instances from our worked example. Add-
itional File 14provides a more detailed worked example
of the procedures taken in relation to improving quality
and engagement on telephone working and increase likeli-
hood of effective and successful implementation of an
intervention in clinical practice.
Results
What was the outcome of the decision-making
phase? Fifty-five domains were rated as ‘essential ’across
all the stakeholder groups and 25 across two of them
(see Additional File 12a). Thus, 80 domains from the 93
initially proposed were included in the behaviour change
intervention. Domains rated as ‘not essential ’(i.e. me-
dian < 7) by two or more stakeholder groups were not
included in the intervention and are presented in Add-
itional File 12b.
From the 80 domains agreed across the majority of
stakeholder groups, 39 corresponded to capabilities (all
psychological), 22 to opportunities (11 physical and 11
social) and 19 to motivation (16 reflective and 3 auto-
matic). Changes in the behaviour of practitioners, pa-
tients, service leads and community members (e.g.
general practitioners) were required. Using the APEASE

criteria, it was decided that changes in practitioner be-
haviour would be addressed in training and that changes
in other targets would be made through leaflets, posters
and booklets. Changes in behaviours across the different
target levels are equally important and interact between
each other (see Additional File 15). We use the APEASE
to retain applicability and practicality across diverse
health settings/services.

change intervention, along with intervention functions
and behaviour change techniques are presented in Add-

services, practitioners and patients) are presented in

scription of the behaviour change intervention is pre-
sented in Additional File 17.
Discussion
Behaviour change is more likely to be achieved if deci-
sions as to intervention content are made following sys-
tematic guidelines such as those proposed in the
Behaviour Change Wheel approach [ 1]. However, frame-
works and guidelines offer a foundation for interventiondevelopment but require additional elucidation at each
stage of the process, and our study provides a worked
example of how to navigate through those challenges
balancing theory, practicalities, resources and time.
The present research thus illuminates the sometimes-
opaque transition from a research evidence base to a be-
haviour change intervention aiming to improve quality
and engagement of telephone treatment in mental health
services. We articulated three phases, namely, evidence
synthesis, stakeholder involvement and decision-making
in the development of our intervention. This research
makes important contributions to the literature by pro-
viding solutions for addressing uncertainties about
where and how judgement might be needed while devel-
oping an evidence-based behaviour change intervention.
It additionally provides clear direction on how to opti-
mise implementation of a behaviour change intervention
to improve psychological interventions delivered by tele-
phone in a complex system, aligning with Moore et al. ’s
[34] view of interventions as events within complex so-
cial systems, mental health policy and service improve-
ment. The following discussion focuses on exploring the
challenges we faced at each of our three proposed phases

decision-making), and how we addressed them; in
addition, the clinical implications of the intervention we
developed are highlighted.
Phase 1: Evidence synthesis
Questions may arise when deciding on the best approach
to integrating and synthesising data from multiple
sources that have used different methods of theory-
informed analysis, such as if the use of a framework
might be useful or if it would be beneficial to involve
people from different disciplinary/professional perspec-
tives closely related (or not) to the evidence.
The gaps between theory and practice interfere with the
implementation of an evidence-based practice approach,
and this has led to the development of different theoretical
frameworks/models by which implementation might be
more likely to succeed. However, choosing the most ap-
propriate framework/model to design an intervention is
challenging. We have chosen to use the Behaviour Change
Wheel [ 1] approach, in which the COM-B and the TDF
[20] models are at the core of it, because compared to
other viable frameworks [ 32,35], this offers additional ad-
vantages. Specifically, the COM-B and the TDF frame-
works are closely related and offer additional, targeted and
easily translatable knowledge on the determinants of be-
haviour change processes for other phases of the design
and development of an evidence-based intervention.
The corpus of the evidence in which our intervention is
grounded included multiple sources of data, highlighting
that no individual source will be complete or perfect and
the integration of different sources of data provides a dee-
per and integrated understanding of the phenomenon
under investigation. It is important to highlight that a
meta-analysis offers robust quality assessment on a topic
(i.e. effectiveness). However, the design of an evidence-
based intervention needs to be further informed by a com-
prehensive understanding on barriers and enablers that in
our worked example are related to improve the quality of
psychological treatment delivered by telephone and aid its
implementation in clinical practice. Consequently, con-
ducting several studies towards this end was key and we
benefited from synthesising relevant evidence that would
not have been available in a meta-analysis. We gained a
deep understanding informed by the COM-B and TDF of
challenges faced on the use of telephone delivery, and
identified key behaviours that need to change at service,
practitioner, patient and community levels to implement
effectively remotely administered care in clinical practice.
The involvement of a multidisciplinary programme team
at early stages of the design of an intervention was crucial
to bring together the expertise and skills of different pro-
fessionals. In addition, from a pragmatic point of view, the
evidence synthesis was performed in a single day.Phase 2: Stakeholder involvement
One of the weaknesses in the implementation of the Be-
havioural Change Wheel [ 1] is the lack of involvement
of stakeholders [ 5], although the situation is changing
and authors are increasingly incorporating stakeholder
perspectives in their intervention development [ 36–38].
In our worked example, we incorporated stakeholder
perspectives and provided solutions to potential issues
such as how to include diversity and equity of voice and
power across stakeholder groups and how to capture
their views in a systematic and auditable way.
The involvement of stakeholders in health and social
care is highly encouraged [ 4]. The contributions from
stakeholders in the development of a behaviour change
intervention, such as the one described in our worked
example, are key to ensure that views from those who
will use the intervention in the real world have been in-
cluded to maximise the likelihood of success at imple-
mentation. For our intervention, key stakeholder groups
included patients, practitioners and key informants (e.g.
service managers, clinical leads) and we gathered their
opinions on the design of the behaviour change inter-
vention using the RAND/UCLA method [ 31]. This
method, differently to other consensus methods, pro-
vides opportunities to identify and discuss areas of
agreement within and across groups of participants in-
stead of forcing consensus. In addition, holding meetings
with each group of stakeholders independently and con-
sidering the ratings provided by group separately, en-
sured equal opportunity and influence to inform on the
intervention development process, i.e. behaviour change
intervention domains endorsed as essential by each of
the groups were moved into the next phase of the
process. The use of a systematic method such as the
RAND/UCLA provides transparency into the develop-
ment of an intervention and makes the process easy to
audit.
Phase 3: Decision-making
There is a gap in guidelines on the involvement of stake-
holders [ 5] in the implementation of the behavioural
change wheel [ 1]. The inclusion of stakeholders on the
design of an intervention has its own challenges, such as
how to resolve contradictions across stakeholder ’s per-
spectives and contradictions between their views and the
evidence. In addition, other issues related to the last
phase of the development of the intervention were re-
lated to the identification of the behaviour change do-
mains to be included in the final intervention; once
identified, how to maximise the likelihood of success
and effectiveness of the intervention into clinical practice
and how to ensure evaluation and replicability of the de-
signed intervention need to be determined.Faija et al. Implementation Science           (2021) 16:53 Page 8 of 11
In our worked example, domains endorsed as essential
by a majority of stakeholder groups were included in the
behaviour change intervention; no stakeholder group
views were prioritised over others. The close interaction
between a multidisciplinary programme team and groups
of stakeholders such as in our example offers a feedback
loop at multiple stages of the design of the intervention,
maximising the potential of success and effectiveness of
the intervention when implemented in clinical practice. In
addition, a systematic and auditable intervention such as
the one we described facilitates data to be cross-matched
and the time from evaluation to refinement is likely to be
more efficient and focused. Furthermore, the description
of the process to develop an intervention is very much im-
portant to facilitate process evaluation [ 39]. Process evalu-
ation is important to know not only if the intervention
works but also to understand how it works to produce
outcomes (i.e. identifying which aspects of the interven-
tion are important, how different elements of an interven-
tion work together, and how and intervention can be
implemented in a specific context) [ 39]. Process evaluation
would ultimately provide evidence to evaluate for
intended/unintended consequences and actual effect of
decisions taken in the development phase. Evidence on
intervention development such as the one provided in our
worked example would contribute to know how frame-
works such as the Behaviour Change Wheel are being
used and ultimately provide information to expand under-
standing on best ways to translate research into practice.
In our worked example, the developed intervention in-
cluded multiple components to prompt behaviour
change at service, practitioner and patient levels to im-
prove quality of telephone-based service delivery models.
In brief, the intervention focuses on:
(1) At a service level: develop robust guidelines and
standardise procedures for telephone delivery, adjust
professional working environment and increase
resources, provide clinical support for remote delivery
and opportunities for professional development.
(2) At a practitioner level: improve knowledge on the
origins, drivers and processes for telephone delivery,
develop practitioners telephone skills and dilute
negative preconceptions about telephone treatment.
(3) At a patient level: increase awareness on different
psychological treatments (e.g. counselling, cognitive
behavioural therapy, guided-self-help) and the dif-
ferent modes of delivery (e.g. telephone, group), and
challenge beliefs of remote delivery being an inferior
quality of care option compared to face-to-face.
Strengths and limitations
Our work provides a transparent and systematic basis
for future research aimed at developing behaviourchange interventions. The development of an interven-
tion using a systematic approach such as the behaviour
change wheel offers guidelines for an effective evalu-
ation. In addition, the use of a systematic method such
as the RAND/UCLA to involve views from stakeholder
groups allows equal opportunity/power, for their voices
to be included on the design of the intervention. A limi-
tation of our research is the absence of training for
stakeholders in research methods and the behaviour
change wheel to enable their participation at each of the
development phases of the intervention; a preferable sce-
nario if resources and time are available.
Next steps
Following the Medical Research Council guidance [ 40],
the behaviour change intervention described in this study
will be piloted in a feasibility study and then based on the
results, a decision will be made regarding conducting a
randomised controlled trial (RCT). The RCT aims to
evaluate the effectiveness of the behaviour change inter-
vention developed to improve quality of delivery and en-
gagement of patients on telephone treatment for common
mental health difficulties in mental health services (for
more details https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/RP-
PG-1016-20010 ;https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/equity/ ). A
complete version of the TIDIeR checklist [ 33]w i l lb e
made available following implementation of the interven-
tion at the feasibility/RCT.
Conclusion
This study provides a worked example on how to over-
come challenges and make judgements while using a
framework approach such as the Behaviour Change
Wheel. We described three phases, moving from the evi-
dence to the intervention involving stakeholders in the
design process. We believe this represents a transparent
and systematic framework for developing behaviour
change interventions in any setting.
