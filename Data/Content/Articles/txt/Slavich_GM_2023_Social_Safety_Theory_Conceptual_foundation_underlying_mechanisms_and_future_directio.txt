Abstract
Classic theories of stress and health are largely based on assumptions regarding how different 
psychosocial stressors influence biological processes that, in turn, affect human health and 
behavior. Although theoretically rich, this work has yielded little consensus and led to numerous 
conceptual, measurement, and reproducibility issues. Social Safety Theory aims to address these 
issues by using the primary goal and regulatory logic of the human brain and immune system 
as the basis for specifying the social-environmental situations to which these systems should 
respond most strongly to maximize reproductive success and survival. This analysis gave rise to 
the integrated, multilevel formulation described herein, which transforms thinking about stress 
biology and provides a biologically based, evolutionary account for how and why experiences of 
social safety and social threat are strongly related to health, well-being, aging, and longevity. In 
doing so, the theory advances a testable framework for investigating the biopsychosocial roots of 
health disparities as well as how health-relevant biopsychosocial processes crystalize over time 
and how perceptions of the social environment interact with childhood microbial environment, 
birth cohort, culture, air pollution, genetics, sleep, diet, personality, and self-harm to affect 
health. The theory also highlights several interventions for reducing social threat and promoting 
resilience.

Introduction
One of the most consistent findings in the social and health sciences involves the sizable 
impact that both positive and negative social factors have on human health, longevity, 
and behavior. Whereas a large literature has shown that social support predicts a variety 
of positive health outcomes, including reductions in both disease-specific and all-cause 
mortality, there is also substantial evidence that social stressors such as abuse and neglect 
negatively impact the development and function of most major organ systems that affect 
health ( Freak-Poli et al., 2021 ; Lupien et al., 2009 ; O’Connor et al., 2021 ; Wulsin et 
al., 2022 ). Given the tremendous amount of research that has been done investigating 
associations between stress and health, one might think there is consensus regarding which 
social factors are most beneficial and deleterious for human health, but this is not the case 
(Cohen et al., 2019 ; Simmons et al., 2021 ). In fact, there is little agreement on this topic 
(Epel et al., 2018 ), leading some to suggest that researchers should avoid using the term 
‘stress’ altogether (e.g., Kagan, 2016 ). Yet others have dealt with these complex issues 
by avoiding them altogether, such as those in the tongue-in-cheek, but all-too-real field of 
stressnology ( Slavich, 2019 ).
How did we get here? One explanation is that we have historically built theories of stress, 
coping, and resilience based on assumptions regarding how we think social experiences 
might  affect health-relevant biology. This strategy amounts to armchair theorizing that 
yields predictions that may or may not be well-aligned with the evolved regulatory logic or 
functioning of the underlying systems that affect disease risk. This scientific guessing has 
occurred for a few reasons, but a main cause is that tools for assessing neural, physiological, 
immune, and genomic responses to social situations have only recently become affordable 
and more widely available (Slavich, 2020a). The second reason for our relatively imprecise 
understanding of how positive and negative social experiences affect health centers on 
the fact that this research has generally been confirmatory in nature with few attempts to 
disprove the theories or investigate their specificity. As an example, consider the finding that 
changes at work predict depressive symptoms (e.g., Li et al., 2013 ). This is not surprising, 
given that change can be stressful. However, because work changes can result from many 
different circumstances – everything from an elected occupational change to unwanted 
social demotion – we must also ask: is degree of change more predictive than other aspects 
of this situation, such as the degree of social devaluation or rejection experienced? By 
focusing on change alone, we will conclude that change is indeed relevant, but this effect 
can be a red herring that distracts us from examining other stressor characteristics that may 
matter more.
To address these issues, we propose that associations between social experiences, health, and 
behavior may be better understood through the lens of evolutionarily grounded frameworks 
such as Social Safety Theory. Rather than defining the key characteristics of positive and 
negative social experiences based on biological guesses or behavioral data alone, Social 
Safety Theory aims to use knowledge regarding the primary goal and regulatory logic of 
the human brain and immune system as the basis for predicting which social situations 
and experiences these health-relevant biological systems should be most sensitive and Slavich et al. Page 2

responsive to in order to maximize reproductive success and survival. Going from biology to 
psychology in this way is not foolproof as it can still lead investigators astray, but we believe 
it represents a more fruitful approach, as it permits researchers to conceptualize positive and 
negative constructs, such as social support and social adversity, in ways that are biologically 
grounded and evolutionarily informed, thus refining our fundamental understanding of stress 
biology and health.
In the present article, we extend work on Social Safety Theory by first summarizing 
the theory, defining its key constructs, and explaining its evolutionary basis. Second, we 
describe the main biological and social-cognitive processes underlying the theory, and 
examine how culture and social institutions affect experiences of social safety and threat. 
Third, we discuss how Social Safety Theory can be applied to study health disparities in 
vulnerable groups and compare the theory to several related formulations of stress and 
health. Fourth, we examine nine key factors that can impact the social signal transduction 
pathways underlying the theory – namely, childhood microbial environment, birth cohort, 
culture, and air pollution (i.e., situational factors), and genetics, sleep, diet, personality, and 
self-harm (i.e., individual difference factors). Fifth, we specify construct measurement and 
theory testing issues that should be taken into account in future research on this topic. 
Finally, we highlight several interventions for reducing social threat and fostering social 
safety at the individual and collective level. In covering these topics, we aim to identify how 
Social Safety Theory may help address critical questions in human health and resilience, and 
what topics would benefit from additional investigation to advance our understanding of how 
positive and negative social factors affect health, well-being, aging, and longevity.
Social Safety Theory: A biologically based evolutionary perspective on life 
stress, health, and behavior
Social Safety Theory aims to account for how and why specific types of positive and 
negative social experiences are strongly related to human health and behavior (Slavich, 
2020a, 2022 ). The theory was developed to help advance classic thinking on this topic, 
which has persisted until today and driven an overly general, sometimes misguided approach 
to investigating the specific types of experiences hypothesized to be most strongly associated 
with health-related outcomes. In the case of adverse life experiences, for example, Selye 
(1976)  argued that stress is ‘the nonspecific response of the body to any demand’ (p. 74) 
and that a stressor is ‘that which produces stress’ (p. 78). Guided by this nonspecific view of 
life stressors and stress physiology, most studies conducted today still use stressor exposure 
metrics that boil a person’s myriad of stressful experiences down to one total score that 
completely ignores the specific stressors that occurred and when exactly they happened, 
thus precluding an examination of whether some stressors are more predictive than others 
(Monroe & Slavich, 2020 ; Slavich, 2016 , 2019 ).
Several more sophisticated frameworks have since been proposed. For example, Holmes and 
Rahe (1967)  posited that a stressor’s impact is related to the degree of change or upheaval 
the experience typically causes, Lazarus and Folkman (1984)  argued that stress arises when 
situational demands exceed an individual’s ability to adequately cope, and Clark and Beck Slavich et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
(1999)  theorized that stressors can be sorted into different life domains such as interpersonal 
(e.g., intimate relationships) and achievement (e.g., work), and that a stressor’s impact 
is heightened when its content matches the person’s cognitive vulnerability. Although 
plausible at the psychological level, the utility of these frameworks has been limited, as 
these distinctions have not consistently predicted health outcomes. What has been missing, it 
seems, is a grounding of these types of distinctions in a solid understanding of the biological 
processes that are most directly implicated in disease risk, and the social-psychological 
experiences that should most strongly activate and sustain these health-damaging processes 
given the basic function and regulatory dynamics of the underlying systems.
A Highly Evolved, Integrated, Prediction and Anticipatory Response System
Social Safety Theory aims to address these theoretical limitations by viewing the relevance 
of positive and negative social experiences from the standpoint of the human immune system 
and brain. As described by Slavich (2020a, 2022 ), animal and human brains evolved over 
millennia to respond to social-environmental cues in a way that maximizes the likelihood of 
reproduction and survival. This function is largely accomplished through allostasis, or the 
processes of anticipating needs and marshalling social, biological, and behavioral resources 
to maintain homeostasis in the face of a continually changing, sometimes threatening 
environment ( McEwen & Wingfield, 2003 ; Sterling, 2012 ). Although the brain is the 
primary organ responsible for allostasis, it relies on multiple sensory mechanisms, one of 
which is the immune system – an incredibly complex and fascinating system, frequently 
overlooked in neuroscience research, which continually monitors the internal milieu for 
cues indicating biological danger including tissue damage and infection ( Slavich, 2020b ). 
Given the extensive breadth and depth of bidirectional connections between the immune 
system and brain, the immune system has been theorized as a ‘sixth sense’ that shares inter 
– and intra-system chemical messengers (e.g., peptide and nonpeptide neurotransmitters, 
cytokines) with the brain that enable continual bidirectional communication and calibration 
(Blalock, 2005 ). In addition to recognizing conserved features of microbes such as bacterial 
and viral genomes, the immune system can detect cellular stress or death caused by tissue 
damage, bodily trauma, and ischemia ( Kawai & Akira, 2006 ; Meizlish et al., 2021 ), and 
modulate its functional activity and capacity based on past pathogen encounters ( Mayer et 
al., 2019 ) and the surrounding microbial environment ( Rook et al., 2017 ).
One of the most notable features of the immune system for stress research is its ability 
not only to react to bodily damage or danger after it has occurred but to mount 
anticipatory responses  to threats that may occur based on past microbial exposures and 
social-environmental experiences (Slavich, 2020a, 2022 ). This ability confers significant 
adaptive advantage, as preemptive activation of the immune system mobilizes immune cells 
to sites of potential injury or infection, which accelerates wound healing and recovery 
following tissue damage, and thus improves the odds of reproduction and survival ( Schiller 
et al., 2021 ). To accomplish this task, the immune system relies on the brain to detect 
increased risk for physical danger as far in advance as possible. In addition to enabling 
the preemptive mobilization of immune system resources to threat, this highly sophisticated 
neural-immune integration maximizes a person’s ability to successfully deal with a variety 
of biobehavioral challenges by modulating energy, metabolism, blood pressure, temperature, Slavich et al. Page 4

diet, and sleep to meet the demands of the situation ( Schiller et al., 2021 ). A complete 
account of brain regions involved is available elsewhere (e.g., Kraynak et al., 2018 ) but, in 
short, includes the amygdala network, mentalizing network, empathy network, and mirror 
neuron system among others (see Slavich, 2020a). As depicted in Figure 1, these systems 
in turn regulate peripheral processes – and vice versa – via the sympathetic nervous system 
(SNS), hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, vagus nerve, and meningeal lymphatic 
vessels (see Slavich, 2020a, 2022 ).
The Critical Relevance of Safety and Threat
If we pause for a moment and think about the types of social-environmental circumstances 
that are most likely to engage this highly integrated, multi-level threat response, current 
physical danger would be atop the list, as it represents the most urgent threat to reproductive 
success and survival. Among social experiences, though, given the abovementioned 
advantages of mounting preemptive  biobehavioral responses to threat, Social Safety Theory 
posits that the Biobehavioral Response to Social Threat depicted in Figure 1 should be most 
strongly activated by social circumstances that indicated an increased risk of physical danger 
over the course of evolution, such as those involving social conflict, aggression, devaluation, 
discrimination, isolation, rejection, or exclusion (Slavich, 2020a, 2022 ). Consistent with 
this possibility, a large literature has now accumulated showing that stressors involving 
these characteristics are consistently – and oftentimes most strongly – related to increases 
in inflammatory activity, which can promote inflammation-related disease conditions (e.g., 
depression, heart disease, neurodegenerative disorders), and with changes in both cellular 
and humoral immunity, which affect the ability to successfully degrade viruses and 
bacteria ( Murphy et al., 2015 ; Murphy et al., 2013 ; Segerstrom & Miller, 2004 ; Slavich 
& Irwin, 2014 ; Steptoe et al., 2007 ). These circumstances also involve differing degrees 
of psychological upheaval and change, as well as many other stressor characteristics. What 
Social Safety Theory posits matters most for predicting health-related outcomes, though, is 
the extent to which a situation is appraised as lacking social safety and possessing social 
threat, which we define in detail below.
Key Tenets of Social Safety Theory
As described by Slavich (2020a, 2022 ), this primary goal and regulatory logic of the human 
brain and immune system translates into three main tenets of Social Safety Theory, which 
advance our understanding of stress biology and elucidate the biological bases of human 
health and behavior. The three tenets are:
• Tenet 1: Humans evolved to foster social safety – namely, humans exhibit a 
fundamental drive to develop and maintain friendly social bonds, especially with 
in-group members.
• Tenet 2: Social safety is beneficial for human health and behavior – namely, 
social-environmental experiences indicating safety have broadband benefits for a 
variety of health and behavioral outcomes, including longevity.Slavich et al. Page 5
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
• Tenet 3: Social threat is harmful to human health and behavior – namely, social-
environmental experiences indicating threat are associated with a variety of 
negative health and behavioral outcomes, including mortality.
Evidence supporting these tenets comes from a variety of fields and broadly supports the 
fundamental notion that experiences of ‘social safety and social threat lie at the heart of 
life’s most impactful experiences’ (Slavich, 2020a, p. 287). To better understand how these 
tenets can be tested, we turn next to describing the key constructs of Social Safety Theory.
Key constructs of Social Safety Theory
Social Safety Theory encompasses three key constructs that influence the extent to which 
social experiences promote vs. degrade health. These three constructs are socially safe and 
socially threatening situations , perceived social safety and social threat, and social safety 
schemas . Across each construct are two distinct, non-mutually exclusive (i.e., orthogonal) 
concepts – social safety and social threat – that can be measured by the actual social-
psychological characteristics of a situation as well as by a person’s perceptions or appraisal 
of the situation.
Socially Safe and Socially Threatening Situations
As described by Slavich (2020a), socially safe situations  are social circumstances 
characterized by social acceptance, understanding, inclusion, connection, belonging, 
cohesion, harmony, support, validation, predictability, stability, and authenticity that 
would have conferred evolutionary benefits. Conversely, socially threatening situations  are 
social circumstances characterized by social conflict, aggression, devaluation, criticism, 
disapproval, discrimination, isolation, rejection, exclusion, turbulence, unpredictability, 
manipulation, and betrayal that would have conferred evolutionary costs. Situational 
characteristics of social safety and social threat thus represent the observable features of 
a particular life event or social situation.
To be considered social , a core feature of the experience must involve an interpersonal 
exchange or have direct interpersonal implications. Given that sociality imbues nearly 
every aspect of human life, life events and situations that could generally be considered 
nonsocial in terms of their primary characteristics may well initiate social stressors and 
have social repercussions, but these latter circumstances should be investigated separately. 
For example, receiving a poor score on an exam can result in negative social evaluation 
and criticism by peers or family members, and a job loss – although economic in nature 
– may precipitate a loss of close social ties at work or social status among friends and 
family members. Conversely, not all social effects must be negatively valenced just because 
the initial nonsocial stressor was negative (and vice versa for positive experiences). For 
example, receiving a poor exam score can provide an opportunity to commiserate and seek 
support from – and provide support to – others who received a similar score. Therefore, 
although these experiences may be bound together, they should be assessed as separate, 
albeit linked situations to ensure precise measurement.Slavich et al. Page 6

Perceived Social safety and Social Threat
Perceived social safety and social threat  represent an individual’s appraisal of a particular 
social situation or interaction as conferring social safety and threat, which is obviously 
influenced by, but still separable from, the observable characteristics of situation. For 
example, an individual may be party to an ambiguous situation (e.g., good friend walks 
by and does not say hello) but interpret that situation as socially rejecting. In social 
instances such as this, perceived social safety  occurs when a person perceives that they 
are socially accepted, understood, connected, cohesive, harmonious, supported, validated, 
or belong, and that others and the person’s relationships with those individuals are 
predictable and stable. Conversely, perceived social threat  occurs when a person perceives 
social conflict, aggression, devaluation, criticism, disapproval, discrimination, isolation, 
rejection, exclusion, manipulation, or betrayal from others, or that others and the person’s 
relationships with those individuals are unpredictable or otherwise turbulent.
The distinction between socially safe and socially threatening situations vs. perceived social 
safety and social threat involves the critical difference between (for example) the extent 
to which someone feels  personally rejected after getting broken up with vs. the consensus 
judgment that the individual is experiencing a life event characterized by social rejection 
and is thus a socially threatening situation. Clearly, the observable characteristics of a 
given social situation constrain the cognitive appraisals that are most likely to be generated 
insofar as someone who gets broken up with is much more likely to feel socially rejected 
than included in that moment. Likewise, someone who has been broken up with is more 
likely to feel socially rejected than someone who, for example, scored poorly on an exam. 
However, the extent to which a person appraises a breakup (or any other interpersonal 
stressor) as socially rejecting can vary, and these individual differences in appraisal are 
critical to measure in addition to the observable characteristics of the situation given 
that neurocognitive perceptions of social safety and social threat strongly influence the 
downstream biological consequences of these experiences and, therefore, the effect they 
have on health and behavior ( Slavich & Cole, 2013 ; see also Shields et al., 2023 ). As with 
stressor appraisals more generally, perceived social safety and threat are conceptualized 
as an acute experiential state resulting from a particular social situation or event ( Lazarus 
& Folkman, 1984 ). In turn, a person’s propensity to perceive social situations as safe 
vs. threatening is thought to be informed by their more trait-like social safety schemas, 
described below. Examples of socially safe and socially threatening situations, and perceived 
social safety and social threat, are provided in Table 1.
Social Safety Schemas
Finally, social safety schemas  are conceptualized as cognitive representations of the social 
self, world, and future, which – unlike other schema-focused frameworks – specifically 
involve the dimensions of social safety and social threat. In this context, social self-schemas 
concern an individual’s conception of their own characteristics, attributes, virtues, and 
resources, such as whether they belong, are lovable, deserve affection and respect from 
others, and have the ability to cope or get through challenging interpersonal situations. 
Social world schemas , in turn, reflect the extent to which an individual generally regards 
other people as friendly versus hostile, predictable versus unreliable, supportive versus Slavich et al. Page 7
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
critical, helpful versus hurtful, and sincere versus manipulative. Finally, social future 
schemas  concern a person’s cognitive representation of their social future as involving 
social inclusion vs. isolation, stability vs. instability, interpersonal success vs. failure, and 
safety vs. danger. Together, these three types of schemas play critical roles in structuring 
social attitudes, expectations, beliefs, and behaviors across the life course. For example, they 
shape the thoughts and expectations one might have about their own tendencies, strengths, 
and weaknesses when it comes to interpersonal situations, as well as what an individual 
can expect from others, the social world, and the future. This framework thus includes 
more than just self-schemas, which are only one schema category in Social Safety Theory. 
The framework also goes beyond attachment theory schemas by systematically including 
representations of the social self, world, and future. Examples of socially safe and socially 
threatening beliefs, organized by the three main types of social safety schemas, are depicted 
in Figure 2.
As discussed by Slavich (2020a), social safety schemas are hypothesized to be shaped by 
the social experiences a person has over their lifetime, as well as by the messages they 
received about the self, others, and future, and by their interpretations of these situations and 
messages. Childhood and adolescence is thought to be a key developmental period for the 
formation of these schemas, as children’s brains are exquisitely sensitive to social input and 
are continually gauging the extent to which the social environment is safe vs. threatening 
(Somerville, 2013 ). To accomplish this task, the brain pays close attention to the actual 
situations a person encounters (e.g., being frequently hugged or included vs. physically 
harmed or rejected), but also to social and cultural norms, and to the messages received 
and meaning that caregivers and peers attribute to socially salient events. Sometimes the 
messages that peers and caregivers convey about the social world are explicitly negative, 
such as ‘That person is dangerous,’ ‘Other people can’t be trusted,’ or ‘People only 
care about themselves,’ but even ambiguous, seemingly helpful messages can impact the 
developing mind’s construal of the social self, world, and future, such as ‘I’m not sure about 
him,’ ‘Just be careful around her,’ ‘Good luck finding love,’ or ‘Remember not to walk 
down that street on your way home.’ The intended goal here is undoubtedly to ensure safety, 
but the implicit message conveyed is one of threat.
These experiences and appraisals are, in turn, hypothesized to shape a person’s expectations, 
beliefs, and behaviors, which include their perceptions and appraisals of their social self, 
world, and future; how they navigate the social world, including the types of relationships 
they develop and how they act in those relationships; and how their brains and immune 
systems respond to social circumstances, which together impact other aspects of human 
cognition and biology, and – ultimately – health. As such, social safety schemas are thought 
to be both informed by and to influence the social situations a person experiences. Due to 
social safety schemas being especially malleable during sensitive periods of development, 
Social Safety Theory hypothesizes that these schemas are relatively trait-like; however, they 
may indeed change over the life course as a function of experiencing particularly impactful 
social life events, such as finding a highly dependable and loving romantic partner (positive) 
or experiencing a socially traumatic life event (negative).Slavich et al. Page 8
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Finally, Social Safety Theory posits that social safety and social threat are not mutually 
exclusive or on opposite ends of the same continuum. Therefore, although aspects of social 
safety and threat may certainly be experienced disparately, they may also be experienced 
simultaneously. Whereas destructive criticism (i.e., criticism that undermines and harms the 
recipient) entails the presence of social devaluation and reduced social safety, for example, 
constructive criticism involves social connection and support in the presence of social 
evaluation, and can thus be perceived as involving both social safety and threat. Similarly, 
a social relationship may be perceived as safe in some respects but threatening in others. 
For example, a person may provide unconditional acceptance to their friend while at the 
same time exhibiting unpredictable or undependable behavior, such as not keeping social 
commitments. Finally, as depicted in Figure 2, people can hold schemas that include beliefs 
of both social safety and threat, as shaped by their prior experiences with both types of 
situations.
Comparison with other constructs
Although the notion that positive and negative social experiences strongly influence health 
and behavior has been described before (e.g., Ainsworth et al., 1978 ; Baumeister & Leary, 
1995 ; Gilbert, 2005 ), our understanding of how different features of the social environment 
relate to biological stress processes in humans has been limited. Here, we contrast the 
constructs described above with related constructs to provide a clearer understanding of 
Social Safety Theory.
Social Stressors vs. social Threat
“Social stressor” is a term that has been used very permissively to describe a wide variety 
of interpersonal experiences. Whereas such stressors can be regarded as socially challenging 
(e.g., ‘This audition is challenging, but presents an opportunity for me to shine’), they can 
also be appraised as socially threatening (e.g., ‘My teacher is trying to make me fail’). Social 
threat refines this broader category of social stressors to focus specifically on the latter – 
namely, interpersonal events and situations that are hypothesized to strongly activate the 
multi-level Biobehavioral Response to Social Threat depicted in Figure 1.
Identifying social threat can be tricky, as it requires intimate knowledge of what actually 
happened as well as how the individual perceived the situation. For example, a heated 
argument with a spouse may be an opportunity for explanation, acceptance, and relationship 
growth or a situation involving social conflict, criticism, and rejection. In these cases, the 
extent to which a social stressor involves social threat will depend on the specific details of 
what occurred as well as the individual’s perception of the situation, which Social Safety 
Theory hypothesize will be shaped by their social safety schemas. Likewise, perceived social 
threat can arise from situations that most people would not consider a social stressor. For 
example, an ambiguous comment such as ‘What happened to you?’ can be perceived as 
socially threatening by someone with a highly critical parent but as caring and supportive 
by someone else. Even situations that would generally be considered socially safe, such 
as asking a friend for a ride to the airport, can be perceived as socially threatening if the 
person asking for the ride believes the request puts them at a disadvantage or in debt in Slavich et al. Page 9

the relationship, or if he or she appraises the experience as indicating to others an inability 
to plan or take care of their own needs. In short, whereas ‘social stressors’ has been used 
to refer to both socially challenging and threatening circumstances, as well as those that 
include varying elements of social safety and threat, we define social threat as that which 
would have increased individuals’ risk for physical danger over the course of evolution.
Psychological Safety vs. social Safety
Psychological safety is another term that should be clarified vis-à-vis social safety. In 
the organizational psychology literature, psychological safety  is the shared belief held 
by members of a team that the work environment is safe for interpersonal risk-taking 
(Edmonson, 1999 ). That is, workers believe they can voice new ideas, experiment with 
novel approaches, collaborate with others (even if it results in failure), and willingly seek 
and provide honest feedback, all without fear of experiencing negative consequences such 
as shaming or ridicule that might result in embarrassment ( Edmonson, 1999 ; Newman et 
al., 2017 ). Workplace psychological safety is often characterized by the perception that a 
social environment fosters acceptance, inclusion, belonging, and support, which is similar to 
perceived social safety in a group setting. As described by Slavich (2020a, 2022 ), however, 
social safety goes far beyond the workplace and describes not only a collective, team-level 
social climate of safety, but also the perception of social safety in all the ‘social circles,’ or 
interpersonal contexts, in which people interact, including family, neighborhood, city, and 
country. Moreover, social safety can be measured as a person’s experiences of safety as 
tied to a specific interpersonal life event or social situation, or as an individual’s broader 
social safety schemas, which are hypothesized to give rise to specific social cognitions and 
behaviors in daily life.
Dimensions of Deprivation and Threat vs. social Safety and Threat
Another distinction that can be drawn is between the dimensions of deprivation and threat 
(by Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2014 ) vs. social safety and threat (by Slavich, 2020a). As 
described by Sheridan and McLaughlin (2014) , childhood adversity can be characterized 
as involving deprivation, defined as the absence of expected environmental inputs and 
complexity, and threat, defined as the presence of threat to one’s physical integrity. Social 
Safety Theory’s conceptualization of social safety and threat differ from this perspective in 
a few key ways. First, whereas the deprivation and threat model focuses specifically on the 
potential for physical harm as being critical, Social Safety Theory focuses mainly on social 
cues that would have historically indicated an increased risk for physical harm, such as 
interpersonal conflict or hostility. Second, in contrast with the deprivation and threat model, 
Social Safety Theory accords distinct and separable roles for positive and negative social 
experiences in influencing health and behavior, with social safety and social threat being 
orthogonal dimensions of human experience that can be measured separately and likely have 
different effects on the brain and immune system. This conceptualization also highlights the 
presence of social safety as being a key, health-promoting feature of social-environmental 
circumstances involving low deprivation – something not underscored by the deprivation and 
threat model.Slavich et al. Page 10

Basic evolutionary dynamics and principles underlying Social Safety 
Theory
To fully understand the central relevance of social safety and threat for stress biology, we 
must take a step back and consider how these systems evolved and why they operate as they 
do. That analysis reminds us that in order to survive, organisms must overcome numerous 
challenges – including physical threats from the environment, social and physical threats 
from dangerous others, and biological threats from pathogens – for at least long enough 
to find a mate, reproduce, and ensure that their offspring are healthy enough to do the 
same. Throughout our evolutionary history, humans are one of many species that evolved 
a complex social dynamic to meet these demands. Living as a social organism required 
humans to navigate social relationships in ways that fostered social cooperation and, when 
possible, avoided social conflicts. Ancestors of modern humans lived in social groups for 
millions of years and evolved complex psychological, biological, and behavioral capabilities 
that helped them maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of sociality ( Henrich, 2015 ). 
Consequently, modern humans now possess empathy ( MacLean, 1990 ) alongside ‘cheater 
detection’ mechanisms ( Cosmides, 1989 ), in-group preferences ( Bloom, 2013 ) alongside 
aggression ( Choi & Bowles, 2007 ), and prosocial tendencies ( Henrich, 2015 ) alongside 
behavioral immune systems ( Schaller & Park, 2011 ), which have combined to shape our 
evolutionary trajectory.
Living within complex social systems has many fitness benefits but also involves 
serious challenges. In terms of benefits, living in groups enabled humans to make large 
advancements in living conditions, health, and longevity by enabling people to work 
together to more safely hunt larger game, protect each other from hostile neighboring 
groups, and specialize tasks leading to tool innovation. Years of research have found that 
increased social integration substantially decreased mortality risk in both humans ( Holt-
Lunstad et al., 2010 ; Vila, 2021 ) and non-human animals such as baboons ( Archie et al., 
2014 ; Silk et al., 2010 ). For example, baboon infants born to mothers who are highly 
socially integrated are more likely to survive into their second year of life as compared to 
those born to mothers who are less socially integrated ( Silk et al., 2003 ). These benefits 
of social integration for a member of a social species also make obvious the costs of 
social threats such as ostracization. Just as social integration decreases mortality risk, 
being socially ostracized greatly increases the risk of death from starvation, predation, and 
infection across all social species ( Williams, 2007 ). Indeed, ostracism in ancestral human 
populations has been described as ‘social death’ due to the large impact that cutting social 
connections has on survivorship and the ability to successfully reproduce ( Williams, 2007 ).
Due to strong selection pressures for maintaining a robust and reliable social network – 
in other words, maintaining social safety – social animals use social exclusion as a tool 
to enforce social norms, which can benefit the group members by minimizing intra-group 
conflict and reducing disease risk ( Kurzban & Leary, 2001 ). Oftentimes, this is carried out 
through the maintenance of status hierarchies and in territorial disputes across the animal 
kingdom ( Wilson, 2000 ). For example, chimpanzees who do not submit to higher-status 
group members are often forced out of the group to prevent further conflict within the group Slavich et al. Page 11

(Goodall, 1986 ). Many social species, from humans to fish, also socially isolate or avoid 
members that give off illness cues ( Dugatkin et al., 1994 ; Schaller, 2011 ), presumably to 
protect oneself and the group from the potentially deadly threat of disease.
Humans, and some other social animals, are thus theorized to have evolved a repertoire of 
adaptive psychological, behavioral, and biological responses to navigate social threats. For 
example, humans are theorized to possess psychological mechanisms that accurately detect 
threats to social inclusion and motivate behavioral responses that increase social safety, 
such as responding to social threats with efforts to re-affiliate ( Shilling & Brown, 2016 ). 
In some situations, social threats can produce behavioral changes that are combative or self-
isolating, especially when paths to reaffiliation are unavailable or unachievable. Biologically, 
social organisms respond to social threats by upregulating inflammatory activity ( Slavich 
& Irwin, 2014 ) in much the same way they respond to physical threats ( MacDonald & 
Leary, 2005 ). One explanation for this phenomenon is that social threats, such as meeting 
a conflictual conspecific, greatly increase the impending risk for physical threats, such 
as physical wounding ( Dhabhar, 1998 ; Slavich, 2020a, 2022 ). Historically, and especially 
without social support, injury could quickly turn into infection and death. Consequently, pro-
inflammatory cytokine levels reliably increase for most people following laboratory-based 
social stress tasks ( Steptoe et al., 2007 ), potentially functioning to prepare the body for 
injury or infection.
Highlighting the highly conserved nature of this dynamic, this inflammatory response to 
social stress is present in both humans ( Slavich, Way, Eisenberger, & Taylor, 2010 ; Slavich 
& Irwin, 2014 ) and non-human animals ( Sapolsky, 2005 ). For example, in one animal 
model study, mice exposed to social stress (i.e., social isolation followed by regrouping), 
but not other types of stress (e.g., physical restraint or loud noises), exhibited greater 
pro-inflammatory cytokine reactivity to an experimental inflammatory challenge (i.e., 
lipopolysaccharide administration; Gibb et al., 2008 ), highlighting the unique relevance 
of social threats for upregulating inflammatory activity in social animals. As discussed 
in greater detail by Slavich (2020a), intermittent increases in systemic inflammatory 
activity to social threat are adaptive and may not pose biological harm. However, as 
humans have evolved the ability to recall past social experiences, imagine potential future 
interactions, and take others’ perspectives to make inferences about the perceptions of 
others, these imagined social interactions, when viewed in a negative or threatening light, 
can initiate the same immunological responses as the real ones, making humans at risk for 
experiencing psychologically mediated, persistent inflammation ( Slavich & Cole, 2013 ), 
a type of so-called sterile inflammation  (i.e., inflammation activated by non-microbial 
signals; Chen & Nuñez, 2010 ). Although, today, social conflicts are generally less likely 
to be resolved by physical combat and isolation from one’s social group is less likely 
to pose an immediate threat to survival, this evolutionarily conserved mechanism persists. 
Given the health implications associated with elevated inflammation in modern contexts 
(Furman et al., 2019 ), this inflammatory response to social threat could be considered an 
evolutionary mismatch ( Williams & Nesse, 1991 ) given that our environments have changed 
dramatically in the last few hundred years, but evolutionary change is slow. Consequently, 
our biopsychosocial responses to social threats are not optimized for or adapted to our Slavich et al. Page 12

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
current social-environmental circumstances but, rather, the circumstances our ancestors 
faced hundreds and even thousands of years ago.
Social Safety Theory provides a biologically plausible explanation for how these highly 
conserved evolutionary dynamics can be helpful in the short term but increase the risk 
for chronic disease and premature aging when the neural and immune threat responses 
are persistently activated. Over time, for example, frequent or chronic experiences of 
social threat – even if only imagined – can modify biological processes, such as 
glucocorticoid-driven inhibitory processes ( Slavich et al., 2010 ). Although glucocorticoids 
typically downregulate inflammatory activity following stress, chronic stressor exposure is 
associated with decreased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity that promotes chronic systemic 
inflammation ( Avitsur et al., 2006 ; Cohen et al., 2012 ; Miller et al., 2002 ; Miller et 
al., 2014 ). Chronically elevated inflammatory activity, in turn, increases the impact of 
experiencing social threats in both humans ( Miller et al., 2009b ) and non-human animals 
(e.g., rhesus macaques; Cole et al., 2009 ), and also increases the risk of biological aging 
and early mortality ( Furman et al., 2019 ). As described by Slavich (2020a), exposure to 
social threats can also lead to chronic inflammation by increasing social stress generation 
(i.e., navigating the world in a way that engenders social stressors) and modifying social 
safety schemas (i.e., believing that one is not socially safe, or that others are a source of 
threat as opposed to safety). In turn, these cognitive and behavioral responses can cause 
epigenetic modification of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in the neural transcriptome, 
inducing epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and altering the hematopoietic 
output of these cells from the bone marrow, and/or triggering increased arborization of SNS 
fibers in the lymph node, which expands the neural – immune regulatory pipeline and can 
promote sustained neuro-inflammatory sensitization to social adversity.
As research on these mechanisms is relatively scarce, future studies are needed to investigate 
how humans respond to different types of social threats – behaviorally, psychologically, and 
especially biologically – to document how these responses differ across various types of 
threats. From the perspective of Social Safety Theory, we would hypothesize that social 
threats will be more salient and impactful for individuals with more negative social safety 
schemas as compared to those with more positive social safety schemas and, similarly, for 
those with less perceived social safety as compared to those with more perceived social 
safety. In general, we would expect to find that biological response patterns to all types of 
social threats will differ based on the specific characteristics of the threat and function of 
the resulting biological response, in addition to whether the response conferred an adaptive 
advantage throughout our evolutionary past. For example, most threats activate the SNS and 
HPA axis, which increases the availability of metabolic resources. This occurs because, over 
our evolutionary past, those who experienced an increase in the availability of metabolic 
resources in response to social or non-social threats were more likely to survive than those 
who did not mount this metabolic response. However, making metabolic resources rapidly 
available is likely maladaptive if the threat a person is facing is caloric deprivation. In this 
case, responding to caloric deprivation by quickly using up one’s stored metabolic resources 
would not have conferred an adaptive advantage for our ancestors. This is one example of 
how Social Safety Theory uses evolutionary logic to draw predictions about how people will 
respond psychologically, biologically, and behaviorally to different types of threats.Slavich et al. Page 13

Biology of Social Safety Theory from a developmental perspective
Social Safety Theory also provides a framework for understanding how social safety and 
threat affect biological functioning and health on the scale of a person’s lifetime, especially 
as a function of experiences occurring during specific developmental periods. As described 
above, the HPA axis likely plays a key mechanistic role linking experiences of social safety 
and threat with health, given the involvement of the HPA axis in helping prepare the body 
for potential harm in the face of threat ( Townsend et al., 2011 ). One way the HPA axis 
does this is by stimulating the release of the hormone cortisol, which is commonly known 
to activate a ‘fight or flight’ response to threat. Past research suggests that differences in 
HPA axis activity supported human adaption to our evolved environments ( Spencer, 2017 ). 
Therefore, HPA axis and other biological system dynamics that effectively mitigated harm 
were highly conserved ( Del Giudice et al., 2011 ; Slavich et al., 2010a ).
Stress responsivity dynamics appear to be especially malleable during a few key 
developmental periods – namely, prenatal, childhood, and puberty. Canalization of HPA axis 
reactivity due to stressor exposure during these periods can significantly affect individuals’ 
biopsychosocial responses to social threat in later life. Indeed, an analysis of eleven human 
studies found that all reported an association between prenatal stressor exposure and HPA 
function in the child ( Glover et al., 2010 ; see also O’Connor, Bergman, Sarkar, & Glover, 
2013 ), with similar effects being found in animal model research ( Creutzberg et al., 2021 ). 
This prenatal programming is thought to improve adaptation to the environmental context a 
child is likely to experience post-birth ( Viltart & Vanbesien-Mailliot, 2007 ). Consequently, 
several affective conditions that are indictive of having experienced social threat have been 
found to be associated with aberrant HPA axis activity, including anxiety ( O’Connor et al., 
2005 ), depression ( Diego et al., 2004 ), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ( Yehuda et 
al., 2005 ; see Tollenaar et al., 2011 ).
Early-life Calibration of the Biological Social Stress Response
Childhood is a particularly sensitive period of development during which time increased 
attention paid to social cues is critical for optimum development and survival. It is therefore 
an important period of investigation for understanding stress biology and testing Social 
Safety Theory. Early-life environmental conditions characterized by social safety and threat 
have been hypothesized to create a blueprint and set of expectations for the environmental 
conditions an individual is likely to encounter across their life course ( Belsky & Pluess, 
2013 ; Ellis et al., 2012 ; Frankenhuis & Del Giudice, 2012 ). Consistent with this possibility, 
threatening experiences occurring in childhood have been associated with the long-term 
dysregulation of multiple psychobiological systems independent of subsequent stressor 
exposure ( Danese et al., 2009 ; Danese et al., 2009 ; Heim et al., 2019 ; Miller et al., 2011 ).
Although these dynamics can damage health in the long term, they are designed to calibrate 
each individual’s biology to the unique demands of the person’s environment to increase 
his or her odds of reproduction and survival ( Bush & Boyce, 2014 ). Consistent with this 
model, growing up in social-environmental conditions fraught with threat has been shown to 
predict the development of a ‘defensive’ phenotype ( Miller et al., 2009a ; Zhang et al., 2006 ) 
characterized by changes in neurocognitive ( Hoffmann et al. 2018 ), HPA axis ( Lê-Scherban Slavich et al. Page 14

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
et al., 2018 ; Roubinov et al., 2018 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ), hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) 
axis ( Deardorff et al., 2014 ; McDade et al., 2016 ; Sun et al., 2017 ), and immune system 
functioning ( McDade et™al., 2016 ; Miller & Chen, 2010 ; Miller et™al., 2011 ). These 
adjustments are theorized to enable an organism to efficiently use the resources available to 
defend itself from potential future threats, including violent others and pathogens. Consistent 
with this formulation, a recent meta-analysis of 29 studies and 4,292 participants, ranging in 
age from 8–62 years old, found that early life stress was related to blunted cortisol reactivity, 
and that this effect was stronger for adults than for children and adolescents ( Bunea et 
al., 2017 ). Likewise, research has shown that adults exposed to moderate abuse or neglect 
during childhood develop particularly sensitive HPA axes, as indexed by potentiated cortisol 
responses to stressors ( Raymond et al., 2021 ; Vegt et al., 2009 ). Moreover, the HPA axis 
reactivity pattern that emerges appears to be strongly shaped by the severity of childhood 
maltreatment experienced ( Del Giudice et al., 2011 ; Vegt et al., 2009 ), with studies showing 
that individuals exposed to more chronic or severe abuse and neglect as children exhibit 
blunted diurnal cortisol rhythms ( Vegt et al., 2009 ) as well as blunted cortisol reactivity to 
threat as adults ( Carpenter et al., 2009 ; Raymond et al., 2021 ).
There is also some evidence that childhood threat exposure shapes biological stress 
reactivity during childhood. For example, children exposed to harsh parenting have been 
shown to exhibit greater cortisol responsivity to a social stressor ( Bugental et al., 2003 ), 
whereas youth exposed to institutionalization, foster care ( Koss et al., 2016 ), and abuse 
(Peckins et al., 2015 ) show blunted cortisol reactivity. Extending this work, Shakiba et 
al. (2020)  found that children who experienced minimal or severe childhood adversity 
as indexed by restrictive parenting, family stress, and family socioeconomic status (SES) 
exhibited greater sympathetic and adrenocortical reactivity than those who experienced 
moderate childhood adversity. However, they also found that children who grew up in the 
most severe conditions exhibited blunted adrenocortical reactivity.
In addition, past research has shown that individuals who lack social safety in childhood, as 
characterized by exposure to early life abuse, neglect, or maltreatment, exhibit heightened 
inflammatory reactivity to social stressors, which, as alluded to above, is adaptive in 
response to actual threat but can have health-damaging effects over the long run ( Carpenter 
et al., 2010 ; Schreier et al., 2020 ). So far, much of the research on childhood adversity and 
inflammation has focused on childhood SES (e.g., Miller et al., 2009a ). This association 
makes sense according to Social Safety Theory, but additional research is needed to 
investigate whether such inflammatory responses are more strongly predicted by early life 
stressors that would have more greatly increased the risk of wounding over the course of 
evolution, such as childhood abuse, maltreatment, and neglect.
Applying a Social Safety Theory lens to stress biology may also help researchers interpret 
mixed findings that have pervaded the childhood adversity and biological stress reactivity 
literature. For example, there is quite a bit of research examining the impact of childhood 
sexual abuse on stress reactivity, but the results are mixed, with some studies documenting 
a significant impact of sexual abuse on stress reactivity and others not ( Wesarg et al., 
2020 ). One possibility is that individuals who have experienced early life abuse but do not 
exhibit aberrant biological stress reactivity profiles possess ample social safety in their lives Slavich et al. Page 15

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
(e.g., high maternal warmth or high-quality social support), do not have negative social 
safety schemas that drive downstream threat responding, or both. Viewing the childhood 
stressors themselves through the Social Safety Theory lens also may help make sense of 
these biological data. For example, perhaps abuse experiences that are most impactful for 
stress biology are those wherein the perpetrator was a close other or the abuse was ongoing, 
both of which we would hypothesize should lead to a more pro-inflammatory phenotype. 
Ultimately, the categories of childhood maltreatment, abuse, and neglect encompass a 
wide variety of actual experiences, some of which may be more relevant for the social 
signal transduction pathways that underlie Social Safety Theory than others. Re-categorizing 
childhood stressors through the lens of Social Safety Theory may thus help address these 
mixed findings and pinpoint the stressor characteristics that are most deleterious for health 
(Hamlat et al., 2022 ; Raio et al., 2022 ).
Stress responses during puberty and beyond
In addition to the vast literature indicating an increased malleability of stress response 
pathways during childhood, there is burgeoning evidence that puberty is also a highly 
significant developmental period for restructuring of the biological stress response 
(Piekarski et al., 2017 ; Romeo, 2010 ; Slavich & Sacher, 2019 ). This is thought to be due to 
the evolutionary importance of puberty in facilitating successful survival and reproduction 
(Schooling, 2015 ). Along parallel lines, neuroscientists have documented structural and 
functional changes in neural circuits underlying the ‘social brain’ during this developmental 
period that make adolescents hypersensitive to social cues and experiences ( Blakemore & 
Mills, 2014 ).
HPA axis— Recent research on this topic has found evidence that the effects of childhood 
adversity on cortisol responsivity and health are moderated by pubertal status ( King et al., 
2017 ), indicating a possible role for sex hormones in modulating the early life adversity-
HPA axis link. Along these lines, several studies have found that early life stress, pubertal 
timing, and psychiatric diagnoses including depression and PTSD interact in predicting both 
diurnal cortisol patterns and cortisol responses to stressors (e.g., King et al., 2017 ; Negriff 
et al., 2021 ). Consistent with Social Safety Theory, some theorists have proposed that social 
threats may be especially relevant in this regard (e.g., Ellis et al., 2022 ). Given that limited 
research has directly compared the effects of different types of early life stressors, however, 
how social threats occurring around the pubertal transition restructure HPA axis dynamics 
that have implications for health remains unclear.
Oxytocin system— HPA axis dynamics are critical for understanding how social threats 
occurring during the pubertal transition and beyond affect lifelong health and behavior, but 
the HPA axis is not the only relevant system. Indeed, the oxytocin system also plays a 
key role in regulating social stress-related processes. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone 
produced by magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus. 
Although best known for its role in shaping parenting behaviors such as lactation and labor, 
oxytocin is also thought to mediate the health benefits of warm social ties ( Porges, 1998 , 
2003 ; Uvnäs-Moberg, 1998 ). Oxytocin has historically been overlooked in research on the 
developmental calibration of stress response systems. However, there is now increasing Slavich et al. Page 16

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
evidence that the oxytocin system is directly involved in evolved survival (e.g., resource 
accumulation, reproduction), and that its function is highly malleable during critical 
developmental transitions, such as puberty ( Quintana & Guastella, 2020 ).
Quintana and Guastella (2020)  reviewed most of the existing research on oxytocin and 
concluded that there is evidence that the oxytocin system functions similarly to any other 
evolved system, restructuring itself during different developmental periods and when faced 
with major biological events such as puberty. Specifically, it is hypothesized that oxytocin 
aids in the formation of social affiliation, which can, in turn, down-regulate stress reactivity 
(Heinrichs et al., 2003 ; Taylor et al., 2000 ). Although the covarying association between 
oxytocin and cortisol is understudied, there is some evidence that greater oxytocin reactivity 
to laboratory-based stressors predicts post-stressor declines in cortisol ( Alley et al., 2019 ). 
Moreover, higher oxytocin levels in young adults have been associated with better accuracy 
in processing cognitive-emotional information during an acute stressor and more positive 
affect during exposure to a chronic stressor ( Young Kuchenbecker et al., 2021 ), suggesting a 
protective role for oxytocin during times of stress following puberty.
When considered in the context of Social Safety Theory, one possibility is that when faced 
with a social threat, individuals exhibiting higher oxytocin levels may experience greater 
social safety – or, conversely, that experiencing greater social safety may lead to increases in 
oxytocin – both of which could mitigate the negative effects of social threat on health and 
well-being. This beneficial effect could occur through the cognitively mediated pathways 
described here (e.g., more health-promoting thoughts during times of threat) but there is 
also growing evidence indicating that oxytocin affects inflammatory activity, meaning that 
the oxytocin system may potentially mitigate the negative impact of social threat on health 
by modulating the immune system. Consistent with this possibility, both animal model and 
human research has found that oxytocin affects inflammatory dynamics via its interactions 
with microglia ( Karelina et al., 2011 ; Yuan et al., 2016 ) and macrophages ( Li et al., 2016 ; 
Szeto et al., 2017 ). Research has yet to investigate how associations between oxytocin 
and the immune system change across development and, in turn, affect risk and resilience 
to social threat. Given the synergistic goals of the oxytocin and immune system, though, 
pursuing this research is a natural next step. Specifically, research is needed to characterize 
dynamic associations between oxytocin, cortisol, and inflammation to determine how these 
systems interact across different social-environmental experiences, such as during exposure 
to social threat without the possibility of social safety, exposure to social threat with the 
possibility of social safety, and exposure to social safety cues or safe people without the 
presence of social threat.
Immune system— Finally, the immune system represents yet another key social signal 
transduction pathway that can be influenced by a variety of developmentally determined 
events and contexts ( Slavich & Auerbach, 2018 ; Slavich & Irwin, 2014 ). These effects 
begin as early as perinatal development, during which time infections and elevated systemic 
inflammation may sensitize the developing brain and immune system to later injury and 
chronically elevated central nervous system (CNS) inflammation ( Hagberg et al., 2012 ). 
Critically, there is also evidence that elevated perinatal inflammation may contribute to 
poor social functioning and neurodevelopmental delays in childhood ( Giraud et al., 2020 ; Slavich et al. Page 17
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Girchenko et al., 2020 ) in what could become a developmentally sensitive positive feedback 
loop that affects immune system function, health, and development over time. Further, 
infection and inflammation are common causes of preterm birth ( Goldenberg et al., 2008 ), 
which itself is associated with negative social sequelae that may shape the development of 
social safety schemas ( Dean et al., 2021 ; Ritchie et al., 2015 ).
The bidirectional effects of inflammation on social safety and threat are likely present 
at all stages of development, but there is evidence that these regulatory effects may be 
especially strong following the pubertal transition. Indeed, inflammatory dynamics change 
across adolescence ( Mac Giollabhui et al., 2021 ), and pubertal status is associated with some 
inflammatory cytokines [i.e., tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8)] 
above and beyond age alone ( Stumper et al., 2020 ). These results indicate that puberty, a 
known period of social reorganization and reprioritization ( Brown & Larson, 2009 ), may 
directly affect inflammatory biology. Given that inflammatory activity is associated with 
enhanced sensitivity to both negative and positive social feedback ( Muscatell et al., 2016 ; 
Slavich et al., 2010 ), and that social evaluation, devaluation, and rejection trigger increased 
inflammatory activity (e.g., Dickerson et al., 2009 ; Giletta et al., 2018 ; Murphy et al., 
2013 ), it is plausible that inflammation and experiences of social safety and threat may 
dynamically co-regulate each other, especially following the pubertal transition when sex 
hormone-enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is stronger ( Slavich & Sacher, 
2019 ). If confirmed, this dynamic might explain some well-established gender differences in 
negative health outcomes that have been associated with interpersonal stressor exposure and 
inflammation, such as depression ( Hankin et al., 1998 ; Slavich et al., 2020 ). Moreover, one 
might expect that this bi-directional association is particularly strong in the context of highly 
salient adolescent peer relationships ( Brown & Larson, 2009 ).
The co-regulation between immune-inflammatory development and social processes that 
strengthens following puberty likely induces effects that persist over the life course, but 
which also get occasionally remodeled as a result of significant life events. At the same time 
that normative age-related worsening of immune function (i.e., immunosenescence ) occurs, 
for example, so too does the likelihood of experiencing major changes to social relationships 
and dynamics that can affect individuals’ social safety schemas. On the one hand, older age 
can bring with it the death of loved ones and age discrimination, which promote experiences 
of social isolation. On the other hand, the birth of grandchildren, increasing support from 
younger generations, and greater recognition and respect at work and in the community can 
foster experiences of greater social status, inclusion, and belonging. In this way, social safety 
schemas may well moderate the process of immunosenescence and, consequently, disease 
burden and mortality risk as individuals transition into older adulthood.
Looking forward, additional research is needed to investigate the reciprocal regulation 
of social signal transduction pathways and experiences of social safety and threat 
across development, ideally using a mix of study designs across the life course. Quasi-
experimental designs planned around common social transitions (e.g., transition to college) 
or periods of accelerated biological change (e.g., puberty) will provide useful information 
about naturalistic, developmentally anchored covariation. Furthermore, given evidence of 
bidirectional effects between biology and behavior ( Dickerson et al., 2009 ; Lopes, 2017 ; Slavich et al. Page 18
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Moriarity et al., 2020 ; Muscatell et al., 2016 ), tests of bidirectionality should be prioritized. 
When possible, it will be important to test within-person effects that are suggestive of 
causal relations ( Falkenström et al., 2017 ) in both observational and intervention research 
to maximize the quality of the resulting data and the clinical relevance of this work. 
Additionally, it will be imperative to consider temporal specificity (i.e., the ideal time lag 
between measurements to capture an effect) when planning longitudinal studies on this topic 
(Moriarity & Alloy, 2021 ). Particularly when developmentally sensitive effects are possible, 
months – or years-long follow-up periods, which are common in psychological research, 
increase the risk of confounding, meaning that shorter follow-up timeframes are preferred. 
Finally, as in other areas of research, studies examining the biology of Social Safety Theory 
should use experimental designs whenever possible to more precisely investigate how social-
environmental, neurocognitive, and biological processes interact to shape health, behavioral, 
and aging outcomes, and how these interactions might change over different developmental 
periods.
Social-cognitive aspects of Social Safety Theory from a developmental 
perspective
Social Safety Theory also provide a framework for understanding how social-cognitive 
processes, including social safety schemas, develop and change over the life course, and, in 
turn, affect human biology, health, and behavior over time.
Development of social safety schemas
Consistent with research on the development of other cognitive schemas ( Kaslow et al., 
2000 ), we posit that social safety schemas are structured and restructured most prominently 
during developmentally and biologically sensitive time periods, such as infancy, childhood, 
the pubertal transition. We hypothesize that major life stressors can also greatly impact 
social safety schemas, especially when they critically change social perceptions, structures, 
or bonds. In each instance, social events can induce changes in social-cognitive beliefs but 
so, too, can the meaning and messages that individuals encounter, especially from parents, 
caregivers, and close friends (Slavich, 2020a, 2022 ). For example, different parenting styles 
can either encourage or discourage a child’s belief in their ability to successfully navigate 
social situations (e.g., ‘You can make friends’ vs. ‘You are a loner’), fostering self-schemas 
characterized by social safety vs. threat, respectively. Similarly, early life experiences can 
set the stage for social safety schemas related to the social world (e.g., ‘Your friends will 
support you’ vs. ‘Other people are not trustworthy’) and future (e.g., ‘You will have a lot 
of friends who care about you’ vs. ‘You will be alone’). In each instance, these schemas 
result from both direct interactions, such as listening to a caregiver’s positive vs. negative 
commentary, and from indirect observation, such as watching parents get divorced or acting 
coldly or hostilely toward each other.
As elaborated upon below, the formation and subsequent updating of social safety schemas 
are also likely influenced by broader socioenvironmental factors, including the relative 
safety of a person’s neighborhood ( Simons & Burt, 2011 ). Additionally, a key factor 
influencing the development of schemas oriented toward the expectation of social threat are Slavich et al. Page 19

adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as early-life abuse and neglect, which, beyond 
having the above-described biological effects, can lead to the internalization that others are 
unpredictable, undependable, untrustworthy, and dangerous ( Neil et al., 2022 ). In addition 
to direct and indirect experiences, childhood attachment styles and their interplay with the 
social environment could shape an individual’s social safety schemas. Whether attachment 
styles and social safety schemas are distinct constructs, overlapping, or identical, however, 
requires further investigation.
Whereas childhood may shape the initial development of social safety schemas, adolescence 
is likely a period during which time these schemas are substantially developed and 
reorganized. Not only is adolescence a period of increased salience of peer relationships and 
social autonomy ( Brown & Larson, 2009 ), it is also when other schemas stabilize in terms 
of both factor structure and temporal stability ( LaGrange et al., 2008 ). First, in adolescence, 
the increased salience of social relationships and freedom to interact with peers without 
supervision provides opportunities for more frequent social experiences that can impact 
social schemas ( Brown & Larson, 2009 ). Second, in addition to relationships with others, 
adolescence – particularly late adolescence – is a period marked by heightened goal-directed 
activity (e.g., application for first jobs or college) that could foster schemas related to social 
safety and threat, both directly through acceptance or rejection, as well as indirectly through 
support, or lack thereof, around these key life events. Third, the transition to adolescence 
is characterized by a shift from self-identifying through concrete, behavioral characteristics 
to more abstract concepts ( Harter, 1986 , 1990 ). Fourth, this developmental transition is also 
characterized by increased consideration of past experiences to inform interpretations of 
the present and expectations for the future ( Rholes et al., 1980 ). Fifth, mid-childhood and 
adolescence is a critical period of risk for the development of internalizing disorders, which 
operate in positive feedback loops with negative schemas ( Alba & Calvete, 2019 ; Gómez-
Odriozola & Calvete, 2020 ). Sixth, as late adolescents/emerging adults transition away 
from their parents and into new living environments such as dorm rooms and apartments, 
there is a plethora of opportunities to internalize beliefs about one’s independent ability to 
successfully navigate social threat, as well as surrounding the nature of the social world and 
the likelihood of experiencing social safety vs. threat as an adult.
Looking forward, additional research is needed to determine when social safety schemas 
solidify, when they are highly malleable and sensitive to social-environmental input, and 
which types of stressors and life experiences are most likely to have an impact. In terms of 
natural life events, there exist many developmental transitions across life course that require 
significant social change or adjustment, and we hypothesize that social safety schemas 
are likely most malleable during these significant transitions. In addition, there are many 
life events in adolescence and adulthood that can induce major social changes, including 
children gaining independence and leaving the house, divorce, deaths, and the transition into 
old age. Along these lines, the malleability of social safety schemas to naturally occurring 
life events (e.g., accepting and nurturing relationships, transition to college, peer rejection), 
laboratory-based stressors, and targeted treatment (e.g., cognitive behavior therapies) should 
be evaluated. Relatedly, studies are needed to investigate if a single social safety schema 
measure can be used for all individuals or if developmentally specific measures are 
necessary. In addition, research is needed to better understand how social safety schemas Slavich et al. Page 20

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
and stress biology co-create and bi-directionally influence each other. Finally, to maximize 
the clinical utility of Social Safety Theory, research should investigate if certain schemas 
(e.g., social safety vs. threat schemas; social self vs. world vs. future schemas) are more 
responsive to intervention than others. If evidence arises that a particular social schema is 
malleable, research could next evaluate it as a potentially modifiable mechanism linking 
social stressors with negative health-related processes and outcomes, including dysregulated 
metabolic and immune system function, anxiety, depression, and somatic/physical diseases.
The role of culture and social institutions in Social Safety Theory
In addition, Social Safety Theory provides a framework for investigating how complex 
social networks and connections, which exist within larger interacting sets of social circles 
and institutions, combine to affect stress biology and behavior. These institutions include 
families, schools, governments, and economic and legal systems (among others) that both 
constrain and encourage behavior through implicit and explicit guidance ( Martin, 2004 ). 
Such guidance can come from norms or expectations, ideologies, and policies ( Martin, 
2004 ). As such, these institutions are deeply embedded in culture(s), or the internalized and 
shared framework through which both the individual and collective experience the world 
(Singer et al., 2016 ). Importantly, cultures and social institutions shape individuals and are, 
in turn, shaped by them ( Singer et al., 2016 ), with this complex bidirectional dynamic 
having important implications for how social and biological processes underlying Social 
Safety Theory initially develop and are maintained over time.
According to Social Safety Theory, social institutions can affect the topography of social 
networks, and thus experiences of social safety and social threat, in several ways. For 
example, our involvement in schools and workplaces can affect who we encounter and 
subsequently befriend based on salient demographic categories such as race/ethnicity, 
sex/gender, and SES. Historic and ongoing exclusion of some individuals based on 
demographics from schools, workplaces, and other social institutions – whether explicit 
or implicit – can contribute to homophily in social networks (see McPherson et al., 2001 ). 
Homophily transcends biology, extending to occupations, education level, political and 
religious affiliations, and other categories ( McPherson et al., 2001 ), and has implications for 
availability of social support. For instance, in her study of middle managers’ social networks 
in four Fortune 500 companies, Ibarra (1995)  found that minority managers’ networks 
were characterized by lower homophily than their White counterparts. These managers 
also tended to have fewer close relationships in the workplace. Notably, the structural or 
institutional constraints on minorities, including underrepresentation and concerns about 
how minority homophilic associations would appear to White colleagues, led to different 
social network structures among minority managers to achieve the same goal – namely, 
career advancement ( Ibarra, 1995 ) – all of which has implications for experiences of social 
safety and threat over time.
Structural constraints driven by interactions with social institutions can also affect the type 
and amount of social support and threat present in social networks. Prior to Hurricane 
Katrina in New Orleans, for example, disadvantaged residents would have needed to know 
80 more neighbors than their wealthier counterparts to achieve the same likelihood of Slavich et al. Page 21

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
pre-storm social assistance ( Elliott et al., 2010 ). During the storm and in its immediate 
aftermath, as individuals shifted to trans-local social connections, low-income residents were 
at similar disadvantage due to fewer trans-local ties, an inability to engage with those ties 
due to financial constraints, and the likelihood that the ties were similarly disadvantaged 
(i.e., economic homophily; Elliott et al., 2010 ). Additionally, geographic areas with greater 
social capital can mobilize to achieve a greater share of disaster relief money and otherwise 
improve their chances of recovery ( Aldrich, 2017 ). In the absence of significant disaster 
relief, low-income residents may need to continue to rely on their social networks for 
support and recovery. This could place significant strain on these social ties, particularly in 
times of repeated crises, even absent major events such as hurricanes or pandemics. What 
should be evident from these examples is that factors that sustain social safety schemas 
– and, indeed, individuals’ social realities – are not confined to the individual (i.e., their 
personality, genetics or life history) but rather extend beyond the person to include macro 
factors such as neighborhoods, institutions, and policies that exert a significant impact on 
lifelong health and opportunity.
The durability and persistence of social institutions derives from their ability to create stable 
expectations about the behaviors of others ( Hodgson, 2006 ). In this regard, institutions 
may themselves contribute to social safety to the extent that such reliable expectations 
are welcome. On the other hand, expected behavior could be negative, as is the case of 
systemic racism and discrimination, and contribute to actual or perceived social threat. 
Such higher-level sources of collective social threat likely interact with acute and chronic 
social stressors that occur directly to people or within their social network(s). For instance, 
the effects of prolonged racism or discrimination could be exacerbated by belonging to a 
network characterized by low social safety and high social threat; conversely, these effects 
could be mitigated by a social network that has high social safety and low social threat. 
Consistent with this possibility, daily discrimination has been found to be related to higher 
C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and fibrinogen in Black adults ( Surachman et al., 2021 ), 
whereas discrimination and other forms of social threat have been related to shorter telomere 
length, a biological marker of aging ( Chae et al., 2014 ; Damjanovic et al., 2007 ; Epel et al., 
2004 ; Mayer et al., 2019 ; Wilson et al., 2019 ). Considering higher-level sources of social 
safety and threat and the role they play in shaping social networks and experiences – both 
alone and in concert with individual-level risk and resilience processes – is an important 
avenue for testing and extending Social Safety Theory.
The role social institutions play in creating stable behavioral expectations may create 
another source of higher-level social threats and stressors – namely, instances when 
behaviors do not accord with expectations. This could be considered analogous to 
predictive processing theories of cognition, wherein the brain actively generates and updates 
predictions about sensory input based on prior inputs and predictions in a Bayesian fashion 
(Friston, 2010 ; Friston et al., 2014 ; Kube, Schwarting, Rozenkrantz, Glombiewski, & Rief, 
2020 ). Prediction errors, or mismatches between predictions and sensory inputs, are used 
to update expectations (i.e., shift priors to posterior probabilities; Greenhouse-Tucknott 
et al., 2022 ); however, they may also underlie risk for stress-related outcomes, including 
pathological fatigue and depression ( Stephan et al., 2016 ) as well as allostatic load ( Barrett 
& Simmons, 2015 ).Slavich et al. Page 22
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Similarly, prediction errors related to expectations derived from social institutions (e.g., 
during the COVID-19 pandemic) may contribute to feelings of social threat and concomitant 
allostatic load as an individual attempts to reorient themselves in a social environment 
that changes faster than social institutions can cope ( Razavi et al., 2020 ; Slavich et al., 
2022 ). The process of acculturation is another potential source of mismatch between 
internalized models of expected behaviors and actual actions taken by others ( Gendron et 
al., 2020 ). Applying Social Safety Theory to individuals or contexts undergoing rapid social 
change may help to greatly expand our understanding of how health, well-being, aging, 
and behavior are influenced by macro-level factors that promote social safety and threat, 
whether these social changes are caused by disruptions to social networks, changes to social 
institutions or policies, or both. For example, globalization, conflict, disaster, and climate 
change are each actively causing significant human migration and distress, fraying well-
established and protective social networks and institutions ( Segal, 2019 ). The consequences 
of such large-scale social change are likely greater for minoritized groups, with a greater risk 
for negative health outcomes. Finally, taking a bird’s-eye view of social safety and threat and 
considering how individuals are situated within social structures and institutions allows us to 
integrate Social Safety Theory with wider research on health disparities. We expand on these 
ideas below to describe in greater detail how Social Safety Theory can help explain health 
disparities in vulnerable populations.
Explaining health disparities in stigmatized, marginalized, and 
disadvantaged populations through the lens of Social Safety Theory
Social safety and social threat are particularly relevant for understanding the health and 
well-being of oppressed and marginalized populations who often experience discrimination, 
aggression, rejection, and exclusion. Early scholars described oppression as dehumanization, 
which influences isolation and hinders access to education, employment, and social status 
of less well-represented populations ( Freier & Kletter, 1970 ). From the perspective of Social 
Safety Theory, the presence of oppression, marginalization, and associated experiences of 
discrimination (i.e., the ‘unjust or prejudicial treatment of a person or group of people’) are 
forms of social threat that clearly entail a lack of social safety ( Lewis & Van Dyke, 2018 , 
p. 176). These experiences are thus hypothesized to activate the Biobehavioral Response to 
Social Threat, which mitigates physical and microbial risk following injury but has negative 
long-term consequences for health.
Although few studies have explicitly tested Social Safety Theory in diverse populations, 
many studies have investigated how discrimination and other oppressing experiences 
negatively impact health in marginalized communities. Broadly speaking, this research has 
shown that experiences of discrimination (e.g., racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia) 
can significantly affect the health, health behaviors, and mortality risk of marginalized 
populations. We summarize this work below by examining how social threat affects two 
key marginalized groups: racially and ethnically diverse populations, and sexual and gender 
diverse populations. We then conclude the section with a discussion of intersectionality and 
the importance of measuring intersecting identities in future research. These processes are 
not specific  to the below-discussed groups but we highlight them as they are well-studied Slavich et al. Page 23

effects and a prototypic example of how experiencing social adversity across the life course 
degrades health and well-being.
Racism and health
One of the most predominant ways in which oppression manifests is racism. Racism is 
deeply ingrained in the United States and is one of the most prevalent forms of oppression 
(Carter et al., 2017 ). Although studies applying Social Safety Theory to racially and 
ethnically diverse populations are lacking, the theory provides an explanatory framework 
for understanding existing findings in this literature. For instance, extensive research has 
examined how racial and ethnic marginalization (e.g., discrimination, aggression, rejection, 
exclusion) predicts poor health in a variety of marginalized populations. In reviewing this 
literature, Carter and colleagues (2017)  conducted a meta-analysis of 105 studies on racial 
discrimination and health and found that racial discrimination was consistently related to 
poorer mental and physical health. Research also has found that discrimination increases the 
risk of experiencing several major health problems, including hypertension, breast cancer, 
obesity, and high blood pressure (see Williams & Mohammed, 2009 ).
Similarly, Pascoe and Smart Richman (2009)  conducted a meta-analysis of 110 studies 
investigating the association between discrimination and mental health. Of the 500 effects 
examined, 90% indicated that discrimination is related to experiencing more mental health 
problems and 69% of these associations were statistically significant. Some researchers have 
hypothesized that these mental health disparities arise from greater substance use in racially 
and ethnically diverse populations, but substance use also may be due to discrimination 
exposure insofar as substance use is one way that individuals cope with the harm of 
marginalization ( Bennett et al., 2005 ). In short, discrimination likely impacts the mental 
and behavioral health of marginalized individuals through multiple biobehavioral pathways 
that are delineated by Social Safety Theory.
Discrimination also negatively impacts the physical health of people of color – an effect 
that is exacerbated by the current structure of the U.S. healthcare system, which promotes 
collective experiences of social threat and a sense that there is a general lack of safety. Along 
these lines, extensive research has shown that communities of color have poorer access to 
quality and reliable health care, and they are often dissatisfied with their care ( Riley, 2012 ). 
This lack of access to quality care can contribute to greater mortality in populations of color 
and was an especially significant problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 
the United States, mortality due to COVID-19 was up to three times higher in Black and 
Latinx communities than in White communities ( Alcendor, 2020 ).
Discrimination and health
Although racism is a major problem in the United States that contributes to significant 
health disparities in populations of color ( Trent et al., 2019 ), many other social threats 
also impact health, including gender and/or sexual orientation-based discrimination. In fact, 
sexually diverse populations, such as those who have had sexual or romantic relationships 
or attractions outside of exclusive heterosexuality, and gender diverse populations, such as 
those with gender identities or expressions that differ from their birth-assigned sex/gender, Slavich et al. Page 24

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
who may identify as trans, non-binary, and gender fluid (SGD), are known to experience 
more health disparities than their heterosexual counterparts ( Diamond et al., 2021 ). 
Substantial research has documented mental health disparities in SGD populations, with 
heterosexual individuals having far better mental health than sexually diverse and bisexual 
individuals, with fluid individuals faring the worst ( Frisell et al., 2010 ; Hatzenbuehler, 
2014 ). Consistent with Social Safety Theory, researchers have hypothesized that these 
disparities are likely a result of cumulative minority stress, or the experience of prejudice, 
rejection, internalized homophobia, and hiding of one’s identity ( Frisell et al., 2010 ; 
Hatzenbuehler, 2014 ; Meyer, 2003 ). Social Safety Theory advances this work by connecting 
the dots between experiences of social threat and health-damaging biological dynamics.
Studies have also shown that SGD populations face significant disparities in physical health. 
Consequently, many researchers have attempted to extend Meyer’s (2003)  minority stress 
theory to describe how both mental and physical health disparities develop. Specifically, 
Diamond et al. (2021)  reviewed existing research on health disparities in SGD populations 
and used Social Safety Theory as a theoretical explanation for these disparities. In doing so, 
they suggested that minority stressors and discrimination signal a lack of social safety and 
the presence of social threat, which in turn activate biological responses meant to mitigate 
physical and microbial threats that can degrade health if prolonged.
Consistent with this model, past studies have found that sexual orientation/identity 
discrimination (e.g., homophobia) is a strong driver of physical health disparities in SGD 
populations (for a review, see Lick, Durso, & Johnson, 2013 ). In general, as compared 
with heterosexual individuals, SGD individuals exhibit elevated rates of arthritis, functional 
disability, asthma, some cancers, and cardiovascular problems ( Diamond et al., 2021 ; 
Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2013 ). Many of these studies reflect the literature examining 
social threat and mental health, suggesting that bisexual individuals – and primarily bisexual 
women – have the poorest health outcomes ( Steele et al., 2009 ). Past research also has 
found that SGD populations have greater mortality risk than heterosexual populations, 
although this effect may be driven by sexually diverse women ( Laughney & Eliason, 2022 ). 
Again, similar to the literature on racial and ethnic diversity, research suggests that elevated 
substance (e.g., alcohol and tobacco) use in SGD populations may be partly responsible for 
the greater health difficulties evident in SGD populations ( Bränström & Pachankis, 2018 ; 
Cochran & Mays, 2009 ). Consistent with Social Safety Theory, however, this research again 
suggests that this increased substance use might not be due to SGD identities but rather to 
the high levels of discrimination experienced in this population ( McCabe et al., 2010 ).
Although disparities in health exist between heterosexual and SGD populations, it is also 
important to note that significant disparities exist within  the SGD population. For example, 
bisexual individuals experience more discrimination and have poorer health outcomes than 
their heterosexual and gay counterparts ( Diamond et al., 2021 ; Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, 
& Link, 2013 ). Studies have suggested that bisexual individuals may exhibit the worst 
mental and physical health outcomes because they face social threat from not only 
heterosexual individuals but also other members of the SGD community ( Meyer, 2003 ; 
Ross et al., 2018 ; Yoshino, 2000 ). Likewise, there is growing evidence that gender-diverse 
individuals face greater health disparities than their sexually diverse counterparts due to the Slavich et al. Page 25

unique discrimination experiences of trans and non-binary individuals in the United States 
(Diamond et al., 2021 ). Although access to safe and affirming medical care that fosters 
social safety has increased in recent years ( Chen et al., 2018 ), this is still a major hindrance 
for gender-diverse individuals seeking care and presents difficulties when these individuals 
seek practitioners for gender-affirming surgeries and interventions. Ultimately, determining 
the variability in health outcomes attributable to social threat vs. poor access to high-quality 
care is an important topic that requires additional attention.
Intersectionality
Individual differences in health disparities within SGD populations bring up another 
critically important concept for future research: intersectionality. Intersectionality, or the 
influence of multiple intersecting identities (e.g., age, gender, sexual orientation, SES) on 
social interactions and environmental experiences, is critically important for understanding 
how complex, interrelated sources of social threat impact health. One of the most important 
health-relevant factors in this vein is SES, and Social Safety Theory provides a model for 
understanding how differences in SES impact health.
SES is considered one of the greatest drivers of health disparities across the world ( WHO 
Health Commission, 2008 ). Whereas low SES itself can hinder an individual’s ability to 
engage in health-promoting behaviors and reduce access to quality food, medical care, 
quality education and more, it is challenging to separate SES from key health-damaging 
social threats, such as oppression, social inequality, rejection, and exclusion. One way to 
measure SES, for example, is by household wealth, and the racial differences in wealth in 
the U.S. are staggering. For every dollar earned by White households in the United States, 
Asian households earn 83 cents, Hispanic households earn 7 cents, and Black households 
earn 6 cents ( US Census Bureau, 2014 ). These striking differences in income can lead 
to poorer health outcomes for these populations of color by multiple biopsychosocial 
mechanisms that include exposure to SES-related stigma, lack of resources for health care 
and health promotion, and lack of access to education. How intersectionality is related to 
these mechanisms, however, is complicated and dynamic. Take Black men, for example; 
they hold one marginalized identity (being Black) and one high-status identity (being 
male). Yet, Black men are disproportionately targeted by police, and this cannot be easily 
explained by simply examining the number of marginalized identities that this population 
holds ( Hester et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is important to investigate not just how many 
marginalized identities a person holds but how a person’s marginalized identities interact 
with one another, and how these interactions, in turn, influence experiences of social safety 
and threat.
Intersectionality is also an important concept when examining health outcomes. For 
example, using cross-sectional data, Mereish and Bradford (2014)  found a three-way 
interaction between race, gender, and sexual orientation in predicting substance use 
problems, suggesting that the intersection of these identities is nuanced and complicated, 
and that assessing all three factors may be important for understanding health disparities. 
More specific to Social Safety Theory, Van Dyke et al. (2017)  found that greater SES-based 
discrimination predicted higher levels of CRP, but only for Black individuals who had Slavich et al. Page 26

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
higher educational status. In general, though, studies on intersectionality are seriously 
lacking. There is certainly value in understanding how specific social threats such as racial, 
ethnic, gender, and orientation-based discrimination predict health outcomes in specific 
marginalized populations, but that is not enough. Future research, we believe, should 
measure not only multiple identity facets (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, disability status, 
sexual orientation) but also factors at both the micro and macro level that identify general 
trends in social attitudes. At the micro-level, researchers should consider measuring factors 
such as internalized racism and homophobia, family attitudes and acceptance, religious 
affiliation, personal SES, and social support. At the macro level, in contrast, researchers 
should consider measuring factors such as political affiliation in the geographic location in 
which people live, current political attitudes and trends, and policies that both increase and 
reduce oppression and exclusion in order to fully appreciate how the social environment 
shapes mental and physical health. Along these lines, Gonzales and Ehrenfeld (2018)  found 
that SGD individuals living in states with fewer structural protections for SGD populations 
were more likely to report poor health. Again, however, work on this general topic is sorely 
lacking.
The main point here is that although substantial research has examined how social threats 
such as discrimination and exclusion affect health, very few studies have investigated how 
multiple intersecting identities lead to experiences of social threat that, in turn, influence 
disease risk, morbidity, or mortality. Furthermore, considerable research has examined 
associations between social threat and health outcomes in marginalized groups such as 
Black and SGD individuals as a whole, but very few studies have looked at these relations 
in detail to elucidate, for example, within-groups differences or population-specific risk 
and protective factors. In addition, many marginalized groups remain largely understudied, 
including multiracial individuals, persons with mental and physical disabilities, and 
individuals who go against prevailing social ‘norms’ such as women who choose to not 
have children and men who choose to be the primary caretaker. Further, many of the studies 
presented above used retrospective measures, and there is a distinct lack of longitudinal 
work aimed at elucidating the timing of these processes or providing evidence of causal 
associations. In each of these cases, applying Social Safety Theory provides not only 
a framework for predicting which specific types of adversity should be most impactful, 
but also a model for understanding how these stressors get converted into health-altering 
biology.
Moving beyond threat: The protective aspects of social safety
One important contribution Social Safety Theory makes, which we have perhaps only 
implicitly mentioned thus far, is that it provides a conceptual framework for understanding 
not just why socially threatening experiences are harmful to health but also why social 
safety appears to buffer the negative effects of social threats in health disparities 
research. In a recent prototypic study on this topic, researchers examined the association 
between discrimination, depression, physical health, and social support in 204 Latinx adult 
immigrants and found that the association between discrimination and physical health 
was mediated by depression; however, the presence of social support protected those who 
experienced discrimination from developing negative health outcomes ( Cariello et al., 2022 ). Slavich et al. Page 27
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Social Safety Theory can help explain these effects insofar as the presence of social 
safety would be hypothesized to downregulate SNS and HPA axis activity, which would, 
in turn, reduce inflammatory responding, a key mechanisms underlying both depression 
and physical health problems. Therefore, even in the presence of social threat (i.e.,., 
discrimination), social safety (i.e., social support) appears to play a critical role.
In addition to providing a mechanistic model of how positive social experiences influence 
biological processes that confer resilience, this focus on social safety can also refocus 
research efforts away from only studying disease biology and toward also investigating 
biopsychosocial processes underlying desirable outcomes, such as affiliation, affirmation, 
inclusion, belonging, meaning, and joy. Studying these processes would generate the much-
needed evidentiary base for salutogenesis and also provide new avenues for understanding 
the biopsychosocial roots of thriving and resilience in marginalized groups, including 
SGD populations and beyond ( Diamond & Alley, 2022 ). This work may also lead to the 
identification or development of additional strategies health care providers, policymakers, 
and others can use not only to reduce social threat and disease risk, but also to increase 
social safety, strength, and well-being in individuals and communities alike.
If we can ultimately identify social factors related to differences in health but also the 
biological processes through which these effects occur, we will come one step closer to 
developing more effective – and perhaps even personalized – interventions for reducing 
disease risk and promoting well-being. Such interventions are needed for all but especially 
for marginalized populations who experience the greatest burden and who need innovative, 
health-promoting strategies the most. Social Safety Theory provides a framework for 
conducting research on these topics insofar as it describes the evolutionary principles, 
dynamics, and pathways governing social regulation of the human brain and immune 
system, thus advancing our understanding of stress biology, and helping create a biology 
of psychosocial strength and wellness.
Comparing Social Safety Theory with related perspectives
As described in Table 2, Social Safety Theory can be compared with other perspectives 
on the conceptualization of stressors and stress biology. First, there are many similarities 
between Social Safety Theory and Attachment Theory ( Bowlby, 1958 ), which is a 
conceptual predecessor to Social Safety Theory. A key difference is that Social Safety 
Theory extends beyond psychosocial processes affecting health to describe a complete 
set of biologically plausible mechanisms linking social experiences with human health 
and behavior. Second, Social Safety Theory shares some similarities with the Generalized 
Unsafety Theory (GUTS; Brosschot et al., 2017 ), but differs from GUTS with respect to 
its descriptions of threat preparedness as well as basal, stress-related biology. Whereas 
GUTS posits that basal biological states are designed for threat preparedness, for example, 
Social Safety Theory hypothesizes that threat-related biological processes should only be 
activated for individuals who have experienced their early-life environment as being socially 
threatening. Moreover, Social Safety Theory accords a central role for social safety schemas 
in mediating these effects, with negative health effects being most likely for people who 
possess negative social self, world, and future schemas. Further, Social Safety Theory argues Slavich et al. Page 28
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
that an individual’s basal biology is shaped by the brain and immune system’s drive to 
calibrate to the social environment, and describes the full set of biological mechanisms 
underlying their bidirectional communication.
Third, Social Safety Theory can be compared with Social Baseline Theory (SBT; Beckes 
& Coan, 2011 ), which, similar to Social Safety Theory, conceptualizes social bonds as a 
highly desired and beneficial aspect of human nature. One key difference is that whereas 
SBT accords central importance to the human brain’s assessment of interdependence, 
shared goals, and joint attention in social relationships, with social resources mitigating 
risk and minimizing the need for energy and effort output, Social Safety Theory focuses 
on the absence of social threat and presence of social safety as key signals that reduce the 
likelihood of physical injury and infection, thus minimizing the need for the Biobehavioral 
Response to Social Threat to anticipatorily mitigate pathogen and, therefore, survival risk. 
Fourth, is the Adaptive Calibration Model (ACM; Del Giudice et al., 2011 ), which is 
different from Social Safety Theory in two key respects: First, whereas ACM focuses 
largely on the HPA axis as a key mediator of social-environmental effects, Social Safety 
Theory describes a variety of other biological pathways and levels of analysis linking social 
experiences with health and behavior. Additionally, whereas ACM focuses exclusively on 
threat, Social Safety Theory focuses on both safety and threat. Finally, as alluded to above, 
Social Safety Theory can be compared with the deprivation and threat model of early 
adversity proposed by Sheridan and McLaughlin (2014) . In addition to the distinctions 
noted above, whereas the deprivation and threat model explicitly focuses on early adversity, 
Social Safety Theory is a life course model. In addition, whereas the deprivation and threat 
model is primarily grounded in neural data, Social Safety Theory accords a central role to 
bidirectional neural-immune communication in shaping social behavior and human health.
Factors affecting social safety and threat
The sections above describe the theoretical and definitional underpinnings of Social Safety 
Theory, as well as its underlying social and biological mechanisms and how the theory can 
be applied to investigate differences in health and well-being across the life course. Now, 
we turn our attention to describing nine factors that can moderate the activity of the social 
signal transduction pathways that link social safety and threat with health and behavior. 
These factors include situational factors – namely, childhood microbial environment, birth 
cohort, culture, and air pollution – as well as individual difference factors – namely, genetics 
and gene expression, sleep, diet, personality, and self-harm. This list is not exhaustive but, 
rather, is meant to highlight especially promising avenues of investigation based on existing 
theoretical insights and findings. We begin with the situational factors and then transition to 
the individual difference factors affecting social safety and threat.
Situational factors
Childhood Microbial Environment— The childhood microbial environment may play 
an important role in shaping an individual’s experiences of social safety and threat, as well 
as their biopsychosocial response to social adversity. As described by Slavich (2022) , the 
immune system functions like a dynamic learning system that uses Bayesian forecasting Slavich et al. Page 29
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
to prepare for the specific microbial threats to which a person is most likely to be 
exposed given their past and current surrounding microbial environment. This continual 
calibration of the immune system over the life course refines the functional dynamics, 
capacity, and regulation of each individual’s immunologic response to provide the greatest 
immunological and survival advantage possible ( McDade, 2012 ; Rook et al., 2017 ). Without 
this complex calibration, immune system defenses would be poorly prepared to deal with the 
specific pathogenic realities of the person, thus hampering effective pathogen clearance and 
increasing the individual’s risk for widespread infection.
One factor that greatly affects the specific types and diversity of microbes to which a 
person is exposed is the childhood living environment. More specifically, rural environments 
contain numerous healthy microbes from animals, feces, and soil that help educate the 
immune system and strengthen its regulatory capacity. Today, however, 82% of people living 
in North America live in sanitized urban environments that include excessive antibiotics 
use, treated drinking water, and infrequent contact with farm animals, mud, and feces 
(United Nations, 2018 ). It may seem surprising that such environmental characteristics 
have much to do with social safety and social threat, but hygienic urban environments 
minimize the frequency and diversity of microbial exposures and thus provide fewer 
opportunities for the immune system to practice upregulating inflammatory activity when it 
is needed and downregulating inflammation when it is no longer required (Slavich, 2020a). 
In contrast, less hygienic early-life environments – which are associated with a greater 
diversity of microbial exposures during critical periods of immune system development – 
lead to more frequent acute inflammatory responses and opportunities to develop a tightly 
controlled, counter-regulatory anti-inflammatory response. As a result, growing up in a more 
sanitary environment can hamper the development of a tightly controlled inflammatory 
response, potentially giving social threats a greater likelihood of fostering systemic chronic 
inflammation that does not resolve over time.
Supporting this possibility, McDade et al. (2013)  recruited 1,622 young adults in the 
Philippines and studied the extent to which the effects of social adversity on systemic 
inflammatory activity were moderated by childhood environment. They found that parental 
absence resulting from divorce, separation, or death was associated with 17% lower 
CRP levels for individuals exposed to high levels of feces during infancy. In contrast, 
those exposed to low levels of animal feces during infancy exhibited 47% higher  CRP 
levels in young adulthood relative to their no-stress counterparts. These data thus indicate 
that social threat-related inflammatory levels are strongly moderated by early childhood 
microbial environment. In a more recent experimental study, Böbel et al. (2018)  found that 
participants who grew up in a rural environment surrounded by animals exhibited greater 
HPA axis, SNS, and cardiovascular responses to an acute laboratory-based social stressor. 
These participants also found the stressor to be more anxiety-provoking, challenging, and 
threatening. When it came to participants’ inflammatory responses to the social stressor, 
though, it was those who grew up in an urban environment who exhibited the greatest social 
stress-induced increases in the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), suggesting 
that counterregulatory processes that help limit inflammatory responses to social threat are 
stronger in individuals who grow up in microbially rich environments.Slavich et al. Page 30

Data such as these are intriguing and shed new light on the complex interplay between 
social, environmental, and biological factors that are implicated in human health and 
disease risk. However, very few studies have combined assessments of childhood microbial 
environment with measures of lifetime stressor exposure and basal inflammatory levels or 
social stress-induced inflammatory reactivity profiles. Looking forward, therefore, it will 
be important to compare participants who have grown up in rural vs. urban environments 
to better understand how their antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses vary across 
different social threats, and to examine the immunoregulatory mechanisms underlying these 
differences that predict risk and resilience for disease.
Birth Cohort— Like childhood microbial environment, the relevance of birth cohort for 
Social Safety Theory may not be immediately apparent. However, birth cohort is a strong 
predictor of not just social norms, experiences, and institutions, but also the immunologic 
and medical environments in which people are raised. According to the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD, 2011 ), for example, the number of 
children born outside of marriage and without a solid family structure tripled from 11% 
in 1980 to nearly 33% in 2007. Likewise, divorce rates doubled and are now at 2.4 divorces/
1,000 people, with approximately 10% of children living in reconstituted families and 15% 
living in sole-parent families. The likelihood of being exposed to explicit social threats 
has also risen over this time. In a recent UNICEF (2014)  survey, approximately 70% of 
children 2–14 years old reported having experienced direct social threats in the form of 
verbal aggression, intimidation, humiliation, or ridicule, and approximately 60% reported 
having experienced physical threats such as hitting, kicking, spanking, or shaking.
Whereas socially protective norms have generally degraded over time, other social-
environmental characteristics have improved, which bodes well for those born in the (later) 
twentieth century and 21st century. These individuals have benefited from better public 
health and hygiene, living standards, vaccine availability, and medical and dental care. 
Considered together, these improvements have reduced the likelihood of being exposed to 
inflammation-promoting pathogens; becoming infected in early life with bacteria such as 
Escherichia coli  and Helicobacter pylori ; contracting serious chronic health conditions such 
as chronic tuberculosis, diarrhea, and malaria; and developing certain chronic inflammatory 
disorders such as periodontal disease ( Finch & Crimmins, 2004 ), which is related to 
increased threat sensitivity as well as anxiety and depressive disorders ( Zheng et al., 2021 ). 
Population-wide vaccination availability has also changed over the past century ( Gostic et 
al., 2016 ), which has greatly altered the likelihood of developing serious infections that exert 
persistent effects on CNS and immune system dynamics that in turn shape experiences of 
social safety and threat.
Like birth year, birth month is also relevant for Social Safety Theory. Seasonality affects 
access to healthier, non-inflammatory foods during pregnancy, which are generally more 
available during spring and summer months. However, seasonality also affects an infant’s 
risk of being exposed to pathogens that promote inflammation, which is generally more 
likely in autumn and winter months due to heavier rainfall and flooding ( Doblhammer & 
Vaupel, 2001 ). Childhood exposure to pro-inflammatory foods and pathogens both educate Slavich et al. Page 31

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
the immune system and can lead to a more pro-inflammatory phenotype, making birth 
month important to consider.
We are not presently aware of any studies that have integrated birth cohort into research 
on how social stressors impact the brain or immune system to shape experiences of social 
safety or social threat. Age is frequently controlled for in studies of stress, health, and aging. 
However, testing birth cohort as a potential moderator is a very different research strategy – 
one that may yield new insights into previously unappreciated macro factors that shape our 
social lives and health.
Culture— As alluded to previously, each individual – and our varied social networks 
– are situated within different intersecting social institutions and cultures. There is an 
extensive literature connecting cultural norms, such as stoicism and gender norms, to health 
behaviors, and a growing corpus connecting similar norms to biological outcomes. In 
addition to differences in diet and nutrition, variation in social integration and emotional 
processes have been found to contribute to lower levels of inflammatory markers in Japanese 
adults as compared to Americans ( Coe et al., 2011 ). Similarly, acceptance of negative 
emotions (characteristic of Japanese participants relative to Americans in one study) may 
partly explain smaller increases in IL-6 during these emotional states ( Miyamoto et al., 
2013 ). Whereas expressing anger was associated with reduced health risks (as indexed 
by cholesterol, blood pressure, CRP, and IL-6) in Japanese participants, the opposite was 
found in Americans ( Kitayama et al., 2015 ). Although culture should not be conflated with 
national origin or thought of as monolithic or unchangeable ( Singer et™al., 2016 ; Shattuck, 
2019 ), results such as these suggest that differences in behavioral and cognitive norms – 
certainly a part of many definitions of culture – are able to ‘get under the skin’ and affect 
physiological processes that are relevant for health and well-being.
Like the social institutions discussed above, cultural practices can also shape social 
networks, influence sources of social support, and greatly impact social safety, social threat, 
and health. For example, Dressler and colleagues (1986)  found that support from fictive 
kin (ritual co-parents, or compadres ) was a stronger predictor of lower blood pressure in 
a Mexican town than support from ‘true’ relatives, friends, or neighbors. Likewise, among 
the Mosuo of Southwest China, who live in both matrilineal and patrilineal groups in 
adjacent communities based on geography ( Mattison et al., 2016 ), chronic inflammation and 
hypertension were both lower in members of the dominant sex ( Reynolds et al., 2020 ). More 
specifically, women had lower CRP levels and hypertension in matrilineal communities 
wherein men had higher CRP and hypertension rates and, critically, this pattern was reversed 
in patrilineal communities ( Reynolds et al., 2020 ). Appreciating the role that culture plays 
in shaping not only social networks but also the relative perceived importance of sources of 
social support will be an important avenue for testing and extending Social Safety Theory.
Similar biopsychosocial effects may be induced during the process of acculturation, as 
individuals integrate into new cultural models. Along these lines, Gendron et al. (2020) 
proposed that moving to new cultural contexts should disrupt allostasis because the 
brain develops culturally specific models of the world based on predictive processing, as 
described above. Therefore, when mismatches occur between these cultural models and Slavich et al. Page 32
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
new sociocultural environments, allostatic load begins to accrue with potential downstream 
effects on inflammatory biology, stress, depression, and other sequelae ( Gendron et al., 
2020 ). This is similar to Dressler’s (2007 , 2018 ) ‘cultural consonance’, or the degree 
to which individuals adhere to cultural norms of beliefs and behaviors, wherein low 
cultural consonance is associated with greater stress and worse health. Consistent with 
this formulation, high salivary cortisol and elevated Epstein–Barr virus antibodies have both 
been found in instances of acculturation and low cultural consonance ( Decker et al., 2003 ; 
McDade et al., 2000 ); in contrast, seeking social support in culturally appropriate ways 
has been related to lower CRP levels ( Dressler, Balieiro, Ribeiro, & dos Santos, 2016 ). Of 
course, social networks themselves shift during migration and acculturation, a phenomenon 
that requires additional study in relation to health.
Broadly speaking, the idea that culture influences how people experience the social world 
is not new, but we are not aware of any studies that have examined these dynamics in 
the context of also assessing multi-level neural-immune interactions that have the ability 
to impact health or behavior. Put more simply, there are no studies on the cultural 
psychoneuroimmunology of social stress and health. Future research on this topic could 
determine the individual or interactive effects of changing cultural models and social 
networks on inflammatory and other health markers, and hopefully address the important 
question of how culture influences differences in individual and collective disease risk, 
leading to more precise theory, a better understanding of stress biology, and better strategies 
for intervening to bolster resilience, especially in cultural minority populations.
Air Pollution— As reviewed elsewhere ( Olvera Alvarez et al., 2018 ), ambient air pollution, 
including ozone, nitric oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM), 
can affect the activity of the social signal transduction pathways underlying Social Safety 
Theory. These health-relevant pollutants are emitted from many common sources, including 
stovetops and heating units in households as well as vehicles, commercial factories, and 
animals in the surrounding environment (Slavich, 2020a). The most well-studied pollutant in 
conjunction with social drivers of health is probably PM 2.5, named so because it is ≤2.5 μm 
in aerodynamic diameter. Exposure to these particles has been associated with an increased 
risk for several inflammation-related health problems, including asthma, cardiovascular 
disease, stroke, cognitive impairment, depression, and suicide. These particles are especially 
harmful because they can be inhaled, enter the circulation, and affect brain structure, 
function, and plasticity by inducing local, peripheral, or systemic inflammatory events via 
reactive oxygen species or NF- κB, interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), and TNF- α signaling ( Olvera 
Alvarez et al., 2018 ).
The literature examining how social threats interact with air pollution to affect health and 
mortality risk is growing rapidly. In one of the largest studies on this topic so far, researchers 
analyzed data from more than sixty thousand American adults and found that PM 2.5 < 12 
μg/m3 exposure predicted a 14% increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.14; 95% 
CI [1.13, 1.14]); however, this mortality risk was significantly greater for low-SES persons 
and for Black participants, who are among those most likely to be discriminated against in 
the United States ( Di et al., 2017 ). Documenting the magnitude of this effect, Black adults Slavich et al. Page 33
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
had a PM 2.5-related risk of mortality that was three times greater than that of the overall 
population.
Looking forward, research is needed to investigate what other types of social threats interact 
with air pollution to affect health and behavior, as well as precisely how these interactive 
effects occur. For example, does pollution exposure lower the threshold at which ACEs or 
adulthood life stressors induce a systemic inflammatory response, or does pollution increase 
the magnitude or prolong the length of the response? Along different lines, how persistent 
are the negative effects of air pollution in early life? Does air pollution-related priming of 
the social threat-induced inflammatory response persist across the lifespan despite changing 
environments or, alternatively, do these interactive effects dimmish for those exposed to 
less air pollution in adulthood? Finally, what types of social-environmental circumstances 
or airborne pollutants are most detrimental? Given the data described above (e.g., Di et al., 
2017 ), air pollution-mediated effects on perceptions of social safety and threat will likely 
be high for those living near highways or commercial zones (in urban environments) or 
who cook with biofuels (in rural environments), but more research is needed to clearly 
understand how air pollution acts both directly and indirectly to affect experiences of social 
safety and threat.
Individual difference factors
Genetics and Gene Expression— Turning now to individual difference factors, a 
variety of genetic factors and processes can influence the activity of social signal 
transduction pathways that link experiences of social safety and threat with health. 
These factors include DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (i.e., 
epigenetic modifications) as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or genetic 
variation at a particular genetic locus that can affect a gene’s function and the likelihood that 
a particular social safety or threat signal gets converted into health – and behavior-altering 
biology. Differences in gene expression also play a critical role. The literature on this topic 
is sizable and has been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Cole, 2014 ; Slavich & Cole, 2013 ; Szyf, 
2019 ). Here, therefore, we focus on prototypic human studies that have investigated the 
moderating influence of particular SNPs, given the bulk of research on this topic, and studies 
examining social stress-induced changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory and antiviral 
immune response genes that are relevant for health and behavior.
As described by Slavich and Cole (2013)  and Slavich (2020a), SNPs involved in the 
social stress response play a key role in Social Safety Theory because, among other 
things, they represent a critical ‘gate’ through which social-environmental signals must 
travel to affect health and behavior. Metaphorically speaking, when a particular genetic 
gate is wide open – that is, the SNP confers high transcription factor binding affinity 
for excitatory factors or low transcription factor binding affinity for inhibitory factors – 
then the likelihood that a particular social-environmental signal will impact behavior is 
high; conversely, when a gate is closed – that is, when a SNP confers low transcription 
factor binding affinity for excitatory factors or high transcription factor binding affinity 
for inhibitory factors – the likelihood of a particular social-environmental signal having a 
strong biobehavioral effect diminishes. Functional SNPs that have been found to moderate Slavich et al. Page 34
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
the effects that friendly and threatening social experiences have on human health and 
behavior involving these or other mechanisms include those in BDNF  such as Val66Met, 
which codes for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein, and in CRHR1  and FKBP5 , 
which affect glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity. 
Other relevant SNPs include those in the antiviral immune response genes IFNA  and IFNB , 
which target intracellular pathogens such as viruses, and in the inflammatory cytokine genes 
IL1B , IL6, IL8, and TNF , which regulate immunological responses to bacteria and other 
extracellular pathogens.
In a prototypic example of this phenomenon, Cole et al. (2010)  investigated how a 
functionally active regulatory SNP in the human IL6 promoter (−174G > C, rs1800795) 
related to participants’ likelihood of dying from inflammation-related and all-causes of 
death. They found that those experiencing high social adversity who were homozygous for 
the GATA1-sensitive G allele died 2.8 years sooner, on average, than those with the GATA1-
insensitive C allele. Moreover, this effect was found only for inflammation-related causes 
of death – namely, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. Therefore, 
mortality risk attributable to inflammation-related diseases for participants’ reporting high 
social adversity was moderated by this functionally active regulatory SNP, which the authors 
found converted social adversity into increased SNS activity that upregulated IL6 gene 
expression and increased individuals’ risk for inflammation-related causes of death. In 
contrast, possessing the GATA1-insensitive C allele completely mitigated the negative effect 
that high social threat normally has on health and mortality.
In another example focusing on a different biological system, Slavich et al. (2014)  found 
that participants’ likelihood of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) following a 
major life event involving targeted rejection – that is, the intentional severing of an important 
social bond – was moderated by a functional SNP in the μ-opioid receptor gene ( OPRM1 , 
rs1799971). Specifically, G allele carriers were twice as likely to meet criteria for MDD 
relative to A/A homozygotes, presumably because the former exhibit less opioid receptor 
expression and signaling efficiency in response to socially painful experiences, such as 
targeted rejection. Consistent with this possibility, this particular SNP causes an amino acid 
change (N40D) that affects OPRM1  expression, leading to known differences in social and 
physical pain sensitivity.
Given the known limitations of candidate gene studies, including the fact that they 
have faced reproducibility issues, these findings should be treated cautiously. As recently 
reviewed by Slavich et al. (2023) , however, research on social experiences and gene 
expression has generally confirmed the involvement of these biological pathways in 
linking social experiences and health. In particular, socially safe environments marked by 
maternal warmth, stability, and predictability have been found to be consistently associated 
with less pro-inflammatory and more antiviral gene expression (e.g., Chen et al., 2011 ; 
Miller et al., 2009a ), whereas socially threatening environments characterized by social 
isolation, rejection, devaluation, and exclusion have been found to be related to more 
pro-inflammatory and less antiviral gene expression ( Miller et al., 2009a , 2009b ). What 
remains unknown in this body of work is the extent to which social experiences shape 
hour-by-hour and day-to-day changes in perceptions of social safety and threat, with Slavich et al. Page 35
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
downstream consequences for pro-inflammatory and antiviral gene expression. Combining 
genetic protocols with ecological momentary assessment methods would provide a fruitful 
approach for investigating these issues. Such work would enhance our understanding of the 
dynamic interplay of social experiences, biology, and health, and also improve our ability 
to identify individuals at the greatest risk of developing health problems following socially 
painful or threatening situations.
Sleep— Individual differences in sleep are also important to consider, given known 
associations between sleep and experiences of social threats, and a large body of research 
showing that sleep is strongly tied to health disparities ( Hale et al., 2020 ). Sleep complaints 
are reported by nearly half of all adults, but serious sleep problems are especially common 
among individuals who have been exposed to social threats, such as interpersonal violence 
and aggression ( Gallegos et al., 2021 ). In addition to activating the HPA axis and SNS, 
poor sleep leads to decreased antiviral gene expression and increased pro-inflammatory gene 
expression, which, if sustained, can increase a person’s risk for both viral infections and 
inflammation-related morbidity and mortality (Slavich, 2020a, 2020b , 2022 ). Moreover, the 
increase in the circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 β, IL-6, and TNF- α that occurs 
following poor sleep can heighten neurobiological threat sensitivity, thereby degrading 
perceptions of social safety and making individuals more likely to experience, and/or 
respond strongly to, social threat.
In a thoughtful study linking social threat, sleep, and health-relevant gene expression, 
Chiang et al. (2019)  measured sleep duration and both pro-inflammatory and antiviral 
gene expression in adolescents and found that greater daily experiences of social threat – 
namely, arguing with parents, family members, teachers, or friends; being punished; and 
being insulted or threatened – interacted with shorter sleep duration to predict reduced 
expression of 511 genes and increased expression of 1,894 genes including several that 
promote inflammatory activity, such as TNF , IL1RAP , IL2RB , and IL15RA . Moreover, 
consistent with the social signal transduction pathways described by Social Safety Theory 
(Slavich, 2020a, 2022 ), promoter-based bioinformatics analyses revealed that these gene 
expression changes were mediated by increased NF- κB activity, thus implicating SNS 
activation in driving these differences in gene expression. The authors also went one step 
further and investigated the extent to which general (i.e., non-socially threatening) stress 
levels interacted with poor sleep to yield the same gene expression results, but they found 
that general assessments of stressful life events and perceived stress did not. Consistent with 
Social Safety Theory, therefore, the findings indicate that it is social threats in particular, 
rather than general life events or perceived stress in general, that interacts with sleep to 
affect antiviral and pro-inflammatory gene expression with downstream implications for 
health.
One fact that makes sleep interesting to study in this context is that associations between 
sleep and experiences of social safety and threat are likely bidirectional. For example, 
delayed sleep onset or poor sleep quality can upregulate inflammatory activity and lead 
to greater experiences of social threat that further disrupt sleep (e.g., poor sleep → 
inflammation → social threat → poor sleep). At the same time, experiences of social 
threat (e.g., ruminating about a hostile boss) can prevent sleep onset and/or degrade sleep Slavich et al. Page 36
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
quality, leading to greater inflammatory activity and experiences of social threat (e.g., social 
threat → poor sleep → inflammation → social threat). Given the complexity of these 
interrelations, future research on Social Safety Theory will greatly benefit from longitudinal 
studies that can discern the relative ordering of changes in these behavioral, immunologic, 
and cognitive processes to better understand where in the mechanistic chain interventions 
might be able to short-circuit the self-promoting loop linking social safety and threat, 
sleep, inflammation, and health. Given the paucity of studies that include all of these 
factors, additional research is warranted and may yield significant benefit, given the sizable 
disease burden associated with experiencing life stress, chronic inflammation, and poor 
sleep ( Fuligni et al., 2021 ).
Diet— There are several pathways by which diet also can affect experiences of social safety 
and threat, many of which involve inflammatory mechanisms. Overall, what a person eats 
impacts their health, body composition, and weight. Western, high-fat diets are associated 
with increased storage of adipose tissue, or fat cells. Under conditions of obesity, in turn, 
adipose tissue secretes high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to stress 
(Reilly & Saltiel, 2017 ), which can affect neurocognitive perceptions of threat. Additionally, 
the accumulation of adipose tissue can upregulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
through production of leptin ( Iikuni et al., 2008 ), again having neurocognitive effects.
Diet also impacts immunologic processes that affect social safety, social threat, and health 
by modifying the composition of the gut microbiome. Strikingly, there are thousands of 
strains of bacterial microorganisms in the human gut that make up the microbiome, along 
with approximately 100 million neurons in the small intestine alone ( Furness, 2008 ). Dietary 
patterns alter the composition of the microbiome and can influence experiences of social 
safety and threat by modifying the activity of the brain-gut-microbiome axis, which includes 
the CNS, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, autonomic nervous system, enteric 
nervous system, and intestinal microbiota ( Dinan & Cryan, 2012 ). Specifically, high-fat 
diets have been found to heighten neuroendocrine reactivity and inflammatory activity, 
which, in turn, induce anxiety, hypervigilance, and greater perceived social threat ( Dutheil 
et al., 2016 ). Beyond these direct biological pathways, weight gain from high-fat diets and 
overeating – among a myriad of other factors that cause weight gain – can lead to feelings 
of social stigmatization and threat ( Hunger et al., 2015 ; Tomiyama, 2014 ), thus promoting 
a feed-forward cycle of weight gain, perceived social threat, and heightened inflammatory 
activity.
In addition to intensifying perceptions of social threat, inflammatory activity is a cue to an 
organism that, because of current or perceived illness, injury, or social threats, the future is 
uncertain ( Dantzer, 2001 ). Consequently, inflammation is associated with impulsivity and 
present-focused decision-making ( Gassen et al., 2019 ; Shields et al., 2017 ). When focused 
on the present as opposed to the future – and especially when stressed – people tend to make 
food choices that are high in caloric density and immediately rewarding, but that increase 
the risk for future health problems driven by systemic chronic inflammation ( Adam & Epel, 
2007 ).Slavich et al. Page 37
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Just as dietary choices and eating behavior can influence perceptions of social safety, 
perceived social safety can impact eating behavior. For example, early life stress, including 
resource scarcity and unpredictability, is known to promote opportunistic eating in adults 
(i.e., eating in the absence of hunger; Hill et al., 2016 ). Unpredictability in childhood is 
largely determined by the reliability of adults in children’s social networks and by the safety 
of their environments. In one study on this topic, researchers found that children as young as 
seven years old typically ate homeostatically – that is, they ate more when they were hungry 
than when they were full. However, youth exposed to high levels of unpredictability and a 
lack of safety tended to eat in the absence of hunger, eating comparable amounts when they 
were hungry as when they were full ( Leyva et al., 2020 ). In ancestral environments, where 
calories were often scarce, eating opportunistically in unpredictable and resource-scarce 
conditions facilitated survival. In our modern environment, however – where calories are 
abundant but low quality – these eating patterns likely contribute to the increasing obesity 
levels found among those who grow up in the context of modern resource scarcity ( Nettle et 
al., 2017 ). Based on these findings, interventions aimed at increasing social safety through 
improving the predictability and safety of children’s environments may have a substantial 
positive impact on their eating behaviors, both in childhood and throughout their adult lives.
Interventions for promoting social safety may also improve the efficacy of diet interventions 
delivered in adulthood. An organism without social safety has limited options for how to 
store excess or future calories, something that is especially true in the context of human 
ancestral environments. Even in modern-day environments, food in the pantry does not 
last forever; as such, one option is to store future calories as fat to provide a safety net 
against starvation in case access to food becomes scarce. An organism with social safety, 
however, can theoretically store future calories in their social network as favors that can be 
called upon in dire times ( Nettle et al., 2017 ; Neuberg & Kenrick, 2017; Pascoe & Smart 
Richman, 2018). Using this rationale, one potential application of Social Safety Theory lies 
in its ability to guide the improved effectiveness of diet interventions. Beyond impacting 
psychological mechanisms through which social safety can increase self-efficacy and well-
being, increasing social safety could modify biological mechanisms that perpetuate links 
between diet and eating behaviors, adipose storage, and inflammation. Given the alarmingly 
high levels of obesity worldwide, and especially in western societies ( Blüher, 2019 ), tackling 
this issue from the perspective of Social Safety Theory should be a top priority.
Personality— In addition, individual differences in personality can significantly influence 
how people experience the social world through multiple biobehavioral pathways. For 
example, individuals who are more extraverted tend to be more outgoing and motivated to 
seek social experiences compared to those who are less extraverted. In a study investigating 
emergent friendships in a cohort of students entering a new M.B.A. program, for example, 
incoming students who were more extraverted tended to develop more friends than their 
more introverted counterparts ( Feiler & Kleinbaum, 2015 ). This personality-driven behavior 
could, in turn, lead to greater social safety during critical social-environmental transitions 
that many people find stressful.
Although personality is thought to be relatively stable ( Cobb-Clark & Schurer, 2012 ; 
Sanderman & Ranchor, 1994 ), bidirectional relations between life experiences and Slavich et al. Page 38

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
personality traits likely also exist whereby significant life events, especially those occurring 
in early development, can influence personality and vice versa. Consistent with this 
possibility, Shields et al. (2016)  found that changes in perceived stress levels were associated 
with changes in trait pessimism over five weeks in a cohort of 332 young, middle-aged, 
and older adults. Moreover, research that has investigated associations between personality 
and inflammation has revealed bidirectional relations between personality and health that 
are mediated through inflammatory processes ( D’Acquisto, 2017 ; Luchetti et al., 2014 ; 
Segerstrom, 2000 ; Sutin et al., 2010 ). Indeed, effects have been found between inflammation 
and all Big 5 personality traits: whereas extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness have 
been related to greater inflammatory activity, openness to experience and conscientiousness 
have been found to be related to less inflammatory activity ( Allen & Laborde, 2017 ; Armon 
et al., 2013 ; Chapman et al., 2011 ; Luchetti et al., 2014 ; Sutin et al., 2010 ). Linking 
this research to health, individuals high in neuroticism are known to be at greater risk 
of inflammation-related diseases including depression, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and 
irritable bowel syndrome, compared to their low-neuroticism counterparts ( Lahey, 2009 ).
A limitation of this work is that it is difficult to interpret if neuroticism is a causal factor 
in these associations, as it could also be the case that a predisposition for developing 
inflammatory disease leads to greater neuroticism. Alternatively, it might be that individuals 
with elevated neuroticism develop elevated inflammation because they perceive the world 
as more socially threatening or because they lack social safety. Ultimately, the strength and 
directionality of associations between personality, inflammation, and health requires further 
study, and so too does the issue of how these bidirectional dynamics influence perceptions 
and behaviors involving social safety and social threat.
One recent study that began to untangle the causal direction of these effects examined 
associations between personality traits and genetic polymorphisms that are known to impact 
pro-inflammatory cytokine activity ( Mengelkoch et al., 2022 ). In 213 participants, the 
authors found that possessing polymorphisms that correlate with increased pro-inflammatory 
cytokine activity was related to being more extraverted. In a separate cross-sectional 
study, the researchers found that greater extraversion was related to greater stimulated 
pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Together, these results suggest that a heightened 
pro-inflammatory tendency may predispose individuals to greater extraversion, with the 
researchers theorizing that a heightened pro-inflammatory tendency might buffer individuals 
from costs associated with increased pathogen exposure inherent in traditional social 
interactions with others, as opposed to increased sociality being the sole causal factor 
leading to elevated inflammation. Given associations between elevated inflammation and 
loneliness and social isolation, the hypothesis that extraverted individuals are predisposed 
to having pro-inflammatory tendencies is one that should be tested empirically within the 
framework of Social Safety Theory. Importantly, this example highlights that the relation 
between personality and inflammation is likely bidirectional, with personality predicting 
behaviors that affect inflammation on the one hand, and inflammatory biology shaping 
aspects of personality and behavior on the other hand.
Looking forward, several pressing questions remain unanswered in this context. For 
example, although multiple dimensions of personality are related to inflammatory levels and Slavich et al. Page 39

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
likely influence experiences of social safety and threat, how social safety schemas mediate 
these effects has not been studied. Moreover, do personality trait levels shape peoples’ need 
for social safety, subjective perceptions of their own social safety, or how people react 
biopsychosocially to social threat? Finally, which of these associations are mediated by the 
immune system? Personality is a relatively understudied factor in psychoneuroimmunology 
that we believe should be included in studies seeking to extend Social Safety Theory, as it 
is likely that personality dimensions, specifically extraversion and neuroticism, moderate the 
impact of social experiences on social safety perceptions and schemas.
Self-harm— A final, high-priority individual difference factor relevant for Social Safety 
Theory is nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). NSSI involves the ‘direct, deliberate destruction 
of one’s own body tissue in the absence of intent to die’ and is relatively common in 
adolescence, with a lifetime prevalence of 23% during this developmental period ( Nock, 
2009 , p. 78). Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse are serious social threats that have been 
related to NSSI ( Nock, 2009 ; Stewart et al., 2019 ). Although the biobehavioral processes 
linking social threat and NSSI are not fully understood, inflammation has been hypothesized 
as a key mechanistic candidate (e.g., social threat → inflammation → NSSI; Brundin et al., 
2015 ).
In addition to the possibility of inflammatory biology may play a role in NSSI, Slavich 
(2020)  hypothesized that the opposite may also occur – namely, that engaging in NSSI 
such as cutting or burning oneself may upregulate inflammatory activity in a way that 
increases perceptions of social threat, thus heightening emotional distress and the likelihood 
of engaging in NSSI (e.g., NSSI → inflammation → social threat → NSSI). Although the 
biobehavioral mechanisms underlying this reverse association have not been longitudinally 
studied, tissue damage is known to cause the release of mitochondrial damage-associated 
molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the circulation, and mitochondrial DAMPs in turn initiate 
innate and adaptive immune responses by activating intracellular receptors (e.g., TLR9, 
NLRP3) or cell surface receptors (e.g., P2X7R, FPRs) on immune cells, including those 
that regulate neuroinflammation (e.g., microglia, astrocytes). The resulting release of 
inflammatory cytokines can degrade perceived social safety and increase neural sensitivity to 
social conflict, criticism, and exclusion, leading to greater distress and propensity to engage 
in NSSI (e.g., NSSI → inflammation → social threat → NSSI; Slavich et al., 2010 ; Zhang 
et al. 2010 ). In short, self-harm may be triggered by low perceived social safety but may also 
lead to such perceptions by activating social signal transduction pathways that upregulate 
inflammatory activity and heighten perceived social threat.
Despite the pressing need to elucidate modifiable biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying 
NSSI, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated how NSSI, inflammation, and 
experiences of social safety and threat change in concert with one another over time or, 
more specifically, if NSSI increases inflammatory activity in a way that modulates social 
cognition. It also remains unknown if just-in-time interventions that target social safety 
or social threat might help reduce cognitive-emotional processes that drive NSSI or that 
could decouple socially threatening experiences from engaging in NSSI. Given the current 
high prevalence of NSSI in youth, we believe that additional research into biopsychosocial Slavich et al. Page 40

processes that underlie NSSI is a high public health priority, and that using a Social Safety 
Theory lens for this work may be fruitful.
Measuring social safety and social threat: Laying the foundation for a field
Having explained key concepts related to social safety and threat and several key factors 
that may influence these constructs, we turn now to the important question of how best to 
assess social safety and social threat. This theory, and its scientific evaluation, are young. 
Therefore, it is imperative to lay a solid methodological foundation upon which to test and 
refine these ideas.
The first step involves measurement development and validation in each key area: 
perceptions, characteristics of the social situation or life event, and schemas. Measuring 
these three aspects of social safety and threat will provide an opportunity to begin 
disentangling the social situation from momentary perception from a person’s general 
disposition, which is important for determining what processes most strongly drive 
downstream effects on biology, health, and behavior. This work will also help researchers 
understand the dynamic interplay of social experiences, social cognition, biology, and 
health, as well as the extent to which perceptions and schemas change over time and what 
social cues most strongly induce these changes.
Some existing measures can be used to systematically assess exposure to different types 
of social threats over the life course. In particular, the Stress and Adversity Inventory 
(STRAIN) assesses lifetime stressors that possess a number of different core social-
psychological characteristics, including inter-personal loss and humiliation – two key forms 
of social threat ( Slavich & Shields, 2018 ; Slavich et al., 2019 ). A more comprehensive 
instrument designed to measure experiences of both social threat and safety, however, would 
be even more valuable insofar as it would advance our understanding of how both of these 
dimensions of human experience affect health and behavior.
Following the development and validation of general social safety and threat measures that 
assess social perceptions, experiences, and schemas, it would be useful to create modified 
versions to assess certain social domains, including in dyadic relationships (e.g., romantic 
or parental relationships), as well as in specific social environments and systems including 
micro- and macro-environments. These modified measures could even focus respondents 
on a specific interpersonal life event, such as a recent relationship break up or argument, 
which may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying peoples’ interpretation of social 
situations, how social safety schemas are involved, and which stressor characteristics most 
strongly affect perceptions of social safety and threat, and their likelihood of shaping risk 
and resilience in the face of adversity.
It is likely that the extent to which socially safe and threatening experiences, schemas, and 
perceptions have implications for health partially depends on how a person values social 
relationships and their goals within those relationships, which are both person- and domain-
dependent. One possibility is that safety and threat in domains of a person’s social life that 
are central to their identity may impact health and well-being the most. Similarly, because Slavich et al. Page 41

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
interpersonal goals both shape and are shaped by peoples’ beliefs about relationships, they 
likely inter-twine with social schemas to affect perceptions of social safety and threat, and 
together create upward or downward spirals in relationship functioning via their responses 
and relationship behaviors ( Canevello & Crocker, 2010 , 2015 ).
Finally, two relationship beliefs relevant for Social Safety Theory that will be important to 
include in future research are relationship growth beliefs ( Knee, 1998 ) and nonzero-sum 
beliefs ( Crocker et al., 2017 ). Relationship growth beliefs involve the idea that successful 
relationships are cultivated and developed, which can be contrasted with destiny beliefs, in 
which relationships are seen as stable, unlikely to change, and either meant-to-be or not 
(Knee, 1998 ). In turn, zero-sum beliefs involve the idea that relationships work in zero-sum 
ways – that the satisfaction of the needs and desires of one person must necessarily come 
at the expense of others vs. the belief that win-win solutions that are good for both people 
are possible (i.e., nonzero-sum beliefs; Crocker et al., 2017 ), which could affect the extent 
to which a social situation is perceived as threatening. Relationship growth beliefs may 
influence whether a interpersonal disagreement indicates that a relationship is doomed (high 
threat) or something that can be worked through and overcome (low threat), the latter 
of which could strengthen the relationship. (Non)zero-sum beliefs, in turn, would further 
encourage either a competitive or collaborative attitude to problem-solving in relationships 
(Crocker et al., 2017 ). Given the lack of scales that comprehensively assess social safety and 
social threat processes, much remains to be understood about how these constructs can best 
be assessed together.
Measuring social safety and social threat: Process issues
The development of psychometrically sound measures is an important step toward being 
able to empirically evaluate Social Safety Theory. To provide more practical guidance 
in this pursuit, we turn now to several key considerations – namely, scope of content, 
developmental considerations, the need for validation in intersectionally diverse samples, 
and considerations for repeated measures use.
Scope of Content— As described throughout this review, we conceptualize social 
schemas as a hierarchical construct primarily consisting of social safety and social threat, 
which are conceptually distinct. Both constructs are characterized by a variety of attitudes, 
beliefs, and expectations about the social self, world, and future, as described above. Given 
the natural variety of socially salient events – and consequently the attitudes, beliefs, and 
expectations related to these events – comprehensive measurement is critical. Therefore, 
ideal social safety schema measures should aim to cover a breadth of safety and threat-
related attributions/beliefs (e.g., friendly vs. hostile, predictable vs. unreliable, supportive vs. 
critical, helpful vs. harmful, and sincere vs. manipulative) about a variety of different social 
contexts/events [e.g., the ability to cope with threats and conflict (i.e., social self-schemas); 
fundamental quality and motivations of family members, close friends, authority figures, 
and strangers (i.e., social world schemas); and likelihood of socially safe and threatening 
situations occurring in the future (i.e., social future schemas)]. Consequently, it is imperative 
that breadth of content not be sacrificed for high internal consistency ( Clark & Watson, 
2019 ; Cronbach & Meehl, 1955 ) or short measures. Should abbreviated measures be desired, Slavich et al. Page 42
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
they should be made after, or in tandem with, a comprehensive, gold-standard measure of 
social safety schemas.
Additionally, there are a number of important general recommendations for measure 
creation that should be heeded. Firstly, given evidence that self-report measures frequently 
have items that are interpreted differently by different participants ( Cohen et al., 2022 ), 
instructions, item prompts, and response options must be carefully crafted to minimize 
measurement error. For example, double-barreled items (i.e., items that collapse one or 
more explicit questions into one item) should be avoided. It is also necessary to carefully 
select what quality will be reflected in item responses. Do item responses reflect differences 
in severity or frequency? Are absolute or relative scales of reference used (e.g., ‘Rarely’, 
‘Sometimes’, ‘Often’ vs. ‘Never’, ‘One or two days a week’, ‘Everyday’). Critically, 
the ideal content to assess might vary based on context (e.g., developmental status, 
sociodemographic setting; see below).
Measurement Invariance Across Development and Cultural Context
As discussed above, social contexts change considerably across development. Consequently, 
critical social events (and related schemas) will be different for someone in 3rd grade 
vs. college. Consequently, it is important to carefully consider how developmental context 
influences the ideal measurement of social safety schemas. As researchers consider how to 
best approach this challenge, it will be important to ask if it is even possible to develop a 
social safety measure that is developmentally invariant (i.e., measures social safety schemas 
the same way regardless of one’s developmental context) or if separate, developmentally 
specific measures are needed. Relatedly, given that social safety schemas are posited to be 
influenced by cultural norms and messaging, it is possible that ideal measures of social 
safety schemas could differ as a function of sociodemographic characteristics or cultural 
contexts. Along these lines, it will be important to evaluate if social safety measures are 
invariant across racial and ethnic groups, geographically disparate regions, socio-economic 
statuses, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, or gender identities (see Moriarity et al., 
2022 ).
Considerations for Repeated Measures Use
Finally, given its etiological nature, carefully testing Social Safety Theory will require 
longitudinal study designs. It is critical that this point be considered in the construction 
social safety schema measures. Many self-report questionnaires orient participants to a 
certain time frame (e.g., ‘How many times have you felt X in the past week’). Chronological 
orientation in a social safety measure should correspond to the theorized temporal stability 
of social safety schemas (e.g., whether it is more trait – or state-like in nature). Further, it 
is important for chronological orientation to complement the time between measurements in 
a longitudinal study. For example, it is not ideal to ask participants to complete a measure 
every week if the measure asks about experiences over the last month because the period 
reflected in the answers will overlap between measurements. Also, because it is unlikely 
that all hypotheses will have the same ideal time lags between measurements (i.e., temporal 
specificity; Moriarity & Alloy, 2021 ), the development of social safety measures with Slavich et al. Page 43
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
options for several time lags would maximize correspondence between measurement and 
study design, likely reducing measurement error in future work.
Interventions for promoting social safety and reducing social threat
In this last section, we briefly consider how Social Safety Theory can inform interventions 
for reducing social threat and enhancing individual and collective resilience. To this end, 
Slavich (2020a) posited that individuals are embedded within a series of social safety circles, 
with the individual at the center and extending out to family, school/work, neighborhood and 
the broader community, society, and world (see Figure 3). Each circle independently and 
interactively contributes to an individual’s sense of social safety and threat. Accordingly, 
interventions can be developed and deployed to target these different levels, such as 
individual psychosocial interventions that target maladaptive social cognitions, behaviors, 
and interpersonal patterns that degrade social safety, or school-based interventions that 
reduce bullying, social aggression, and exclusion, or increase social cohesion and empathy 
for others.
Table 3 provides a summary of interventions – at the individual, family, school, and 
community/society level – that may bolster social safety and reduce social threat. Note that 
many of these examples represent modifications that could be done to existing interventions, 
as informed by Social Safety Theory. For example, variants of cognitive behavior therapy 
(CBT) have been developed and shown to be effective for a wide variety of mental health 
problems, including depression ( Beck et al., 1979 ), anxiety disorders ( Barlow, 2021 ), eating 
disorders ( Fairburn, 2008 ), substance use (Beck, Wright, et al., 2011), insomnia ( Perlis et al., 
2008 ), personality disorders ( Beck et al., 2015 ; Linehan, 1993 ), bipolar disorder ( Otto et al., 
2008 ), and schizophrenia (Beck, Rector, et al., 2011). Common across these forms of CBT 
is the focus on teaching clients the skills to identify and modify negative patterns of thinking 
and maladaptive patterns of behavior that contribute to their specific symptoms.
Given its flexibility, CBT could be readily adapted to focus specifically on social safety and 
threat as key content dimensions. With regards to cognitive work, a Social Safety Theory-
informed CBT could emphasize those cognitions that are most related to social safety and 
threat. For example, an individual could be taught to recognize their social safety-related 
core beliefs (e.g., ‘ I’m unlovable ,’ ‘People cannot be trusted ’) and related dysfunctional 
attitudes (e.g., ‘ If I show my true self, I ’ll get rejected ’) that contribute to a heightened 
sense of social threat and decreased experiences of social safety. Existing CBT tools and 
techniques, such as thought records ( Beck, 2011 ), could be easily tailored to help individuals 
modify these maladaptive cognitions and develop healthier patterns of thinking. Similarly, 
with regards to behavioral work, Social Safety Theory-informed CBT could shift the focus 
toward encouraging behaviors that specifically involve fostering actual and perceived social 
safety, such as calling or visiting a loved one, scheduling more quality time with a good 
friend, writing a gratitude or love letter to a partner, and making a better effort to socialize 
and develop friendships with neighbors.
In addition to the core cognitive and behavioral work, CBT therapists often provide training 
in other beneficial social skills, including interpersonal problem solving and assertiveness. Slavich et al. Page 44
Health Psychol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 05.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Informed by Social Safety Theory, interpersonal problem-solving strategies could be taught 
to address ongoing relationship problems to reduce the likelihood of current and future 
disagreements, conflict, and interpersonal stressors from occurring. In addition, individuals 
with a more passive communication or interpersonal style could benefit from assertiveness 
training to enhance their confidence and sense of agency, which could ultimately lead 
to more fulfilling social interactions and relationships. In summary, CBT provides an 
empirically validated and highly flexible framework that could be tailored for targeted 
interventions aimed at decreasing actual and perceived social threat, and increasing social 
safety. Given evidence that targeting social processes is highly therapeutic ( Lipsitz & 
Markowitz, 2013 ), our contention is that psychotherapies may be most efficient and effective 
if they specifically modify social cognitions and behaviors involving the dimensions of 
social safety and threat. Indeed, as described by Slavich (2020a), disruptions in social 
cognition and behavior are a core feature of all major forms of psychopathology, making the 
focus on disrupted social cognition and behavior potentially critical for therapeutic success.
These are just a few of the many interventions that may help promote social safety 
and reduce social threat. In addition to these individual interventions are numerous 
family, school, and community-level interventions that could also help improve the social 
environment within which individuals are embedded (see Table 3). Looking forward, there 
are a number of important questions that future social safety-related intervention research 
should consider. In particular, which intervention (or combination of interventions), at which 
level, is most effective for promoting social safety and reducing social threat? Moreover, 
do some subgroups of individuals benefit more from some interventions than others? In 
addition, research is needed to tailor social safety-related interventions to each client’s 
specific characteristics and presenting problem (i.e., precision medicine), and to test whether 
interventions can be modified to prevent the onset of social stress-related disorders before 
they occur ( Cuijpers et al., 2021 ). Only by pursuing this intervention work will we realize 
the most important benefits of Social Safety Theory.
Conclusion
In conclusion, although we have learned a great deal about the psychobiology of stress 
and health over the past few decades, there is surprisingly little agreement about which 
characteristics of positive and negative social experiences are most impactful. In addition, 
we still lack a complete understanding of how such experiences impact the brain and body 
to shape health, development, and behavior across the life course. The advent of affordable 
methods for assessing stress-relevant biology is changing all of this, though, and if we use 
the resulting data wisely, the result could be an exciting new understanding of stress, health, 
and resilience that is biologically grounded and evolutionarily informed. This has been our 
goal in describing and extending Social Safety Theory herein – namely, to take what we 
already know about stress biology and use this knowledge to identify the social experiences 
that should be most important to focus on given the highly evolved regulatory logic of the 
human brain and immune system. We believe that such an understanding can help reveal the 
biopsychosocial roots of lifelong health disparities and, equally important, point researchers 
toward new treatment targets for reducing disease risk and achieving health equity. Given Slavich et al. Page 45

the enormous disease burden caused by stress and adversity – especially in vulnerable and 
disadvantaged populations – we simply cannot think of a more important issue to tackle.

Social Safety Theory is grounded in the understanding that the primary purpose of the 
human brain and immune system is to keep the body biologically and physically safe. 
To accomplish this challenging task, humans developed a fundamental drive to create and 
maintain friendly social bonds and to mount anticipatory biobehavioral responses to social, 
physical, and microbial threats that increased risk for physical injury and infection over 
the course of evolution. (a) Accordingly, the brain continually monitors the (1) social 
environment, interprets social signals and behaviors, and judges the extent to which its Slavich et al. Page 65

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
surroundings are socially safe versus threatening. These appraisals are subserved by the 
(2) amygdala network, mentalizing network, empathy network, and mirror neuron system 
(i.e., the social brain). When a potential social threat is perceived, the brain activates 
a multi-level response that is mediated by several social signal transduction pathways – 
namely, the (3) SNS, (4) HPA axis, (5) vagus nerve, and (6) meningeal lymphatic vessels. 
These pathways enable the brain to communicate with the peripheral immune system and 
vice versa. Whereas the main end products of the SNS (i.e., epinephrine and norepinephrine) 
suppress transcription of antiviral type I interferon genes (e.g., IFNA , IFNB ) and upregulate 
transcription of proinflammatory immune response genes (e.g., IL1B , IL6, TNF ), the 
main end product of the HPA axis (i.e., cortisol) generally reduces both antiviral and 
inflammatory gene expression but also can lead to increased inflammatory gene expression 
under certain physiologic circumstances (e.g., glucocorticoid insensitivity/resistance). The 
vagus nerve, in turn, plays a putative role in suppressing inflammatory activity, whereas 
meningeal lymphatic vessels enable immune mediators originating in the CNS to traffic to 
the periphery, where they can exert systemic effects. (b) This multi-level ‘Biobehavioral 
Response to Social Threat’ is critical for promoting well-being and survival. However, 
it can also increase a person’s risk for negative health and behavioral outcomes when it 
is sustained by internal physiologic or external social recursion. Several factors can also 
moderate these effects, including birth cohort, culture, personality, childhood microbial 
environment, sleep, genetics, air pollution, diet, and self-harm. A person’s developmentally 
derived social safety schemas play a particularly important role in this multi-level response 
as they shape how social-environmental circumstances are perceived. Indeed, social safety 
schemas influence neurocognitive dynamics that initiate the full range of down-stream 
biological interactions that ultimately affect disease risk and human behavior. Abbreviations:

Individuals are embedded in a variety of social safety circles that determine their moment-
to-moment and lifelong experiences of social safety and social threat. These social networks 
directly affect human health and behavior by influencing the extent to which people 
experience social safety (e.g., strong family cohesion, welcoming neighbors, inclusive public 
policy) and social threat (e.g., family conflict, hostile neighbors, divisive public policy). In 
addition, these networks indirectly affect health and behavior by exposing individuals to 
construals, messages, and meanings that shape their social safety schemas, which in turn Slavich et al. Page 68

Examples of socially safe and socially threatening situations, and perceived social safety and social threat. 
Adapted from Diamond & Alley (2022)  to reflect general population experiences.
Socially safe & socially threatening situations Perceived social safety & social threat
Social Safety
 Being able to interact with other individuals, in person or online, who 
share common interestsBelieving you are around other people who understand you
 Safe Schools Programs that explicitly condemn bullying; training 
teachers and staff to respond to such instancesBelieving your school wants you to feel and be safe, and feeling 
that teachers and staff members are dedicated to supporting you
 Seeing people (e.g., friends, peers, the media) and institutions condemn 
the mistreatment of othersBelieving those around you think the mistreatment of others is 
wrong and will protect you if you needed
 Having family members who provide affection and reassurance, ask 
about your life, and include, support, and protect youBelieving family members care about your friends and life, and 
will provide support and protection if needed
 Having family members and friends welcome your friends and loved 
ones when they meet themBelieving your family and friends fully embrace you, your 
friends, and your loved ones
 Encountering inclusive language on standard forms (e.g., being able to 
correctly describe your identity, race, ethnicity, gender, sex)Believing people in official offices understand and respect 
diversity, and want to represent you accurately
 Seeing family members, friends, and colleagues speak up right away to 
protect you, and that you do not have to defend yourself all aloneBelieving people around you will step forward when you or 
someone else is being threatened, devalued, or harmed
 Having people make room for you at a table, on a bus, in a car, etc. Believing people are comfortable being physically near you
 Having people ask you thoughtful questions about your life and check

Table 2.
Comparing Social Safety Theory and related frameworks.
Comparison 
FrameworkKey Similarities and Differences
Attachment 
Theory1. Social Safety Theory builds upon decades of research on Attachment Theory to describe the impact that social safety and 
threat have on psychological and biological processes
2. The theories are similar with respect to their focus on social schemas
3. A key difference is that Social Safety Theory describes the full set of neural, physiological, molecular, and genomic 
processes linking the social environment and health
4. In addition, attachment theory is more explicitly consistent with psychoanalytic theory than Social Safety Theory
Generalized 
Unsafety Theory 
(GUTS)1. Social Safety Theory posits that basal biological activity is shaped by a drive for neural-immune calibration to the social 
environment and describes the specific mechanisms subserving neural-immune communication
2. Whereas GUTS posits that the basal biological state is one of threat preparedness, Social Safety Theory hypothesizes that 
this is only true for individuals who experienced their early life environments as socially threatening
3. Compared to Social Safety Theory, GUTS focuses more explicitly on unconscious aspects of generalized unsafety and 
threat preparedness
Social Baseline 
Theory (SBT)1. Both Social Safety Theory and SBT conceptualize social proximity as a generally desired and beneficial aspect of human 
nature
2. A main difference is SBT’s focus on economy of action, wherein a primary benefit of social relationships is to preserve 
metabolic and neural resources; in contrast, Social Safety Theory focuses on the reduction of social threat and risk of 
physical injury afforded by socially safe relationships as being a key driver of social connection
3. Additionally, whereas Social Safety Theory focuses on social isolation as being a risk factor for solitary individuals, SBT 
describes this in the context of risk-dispersion among groups
Adaptive 
Calibration 
Model (ACM)1. ACM focuses strictly on threat and unpredictability, both of which confer social threat in the Social Safety Theory 
framework; in addition, Social Safety Theory extends this model to include social safety as a distinct resilience factor
2. Whereas the key pathway in the ACM is the HPA axis, Social Safety Theory describes several additional health-relevant 
systems and levels of analysis, including neurobiological, immunological, molecular, and genomic processes
3. The ACM includes a specified taxonomy of four stress responsivity patterns resulting from different early life 
environments (i.e., sensitivity, buffered, vigilant, & unemotional) whereas Social Safety Theory focuses on the more 
general, early-life calibration of neural-immune responsivity to perceived social safety and threat
4. ACM responsivity patterns include theorized sex-differences in the manifestations of individual patterns (e.g., agonistic 
vigilance for males and withdrawn vigilance for females) whereas Social Safety Theory does not
Deprivation and 
Threat Model1. Compared to the deprivation and threat model, Social Safety Theory posits that experiences of social safety and social 
threat are separable, orthogonal dimensions of human experience
2. Although both the deprivation & threat model and Social Safety Theory focus on threat, the conceptualization of threat in 
Social Safety Theory is primarily concerned with social experiences that historically increased the risk of physical injury or 
infection over the course of evolution
3. Both frameworks are based in data from social and affective neuroscience, but Social Safety Theory ascribes central 
importance to bidirectional neural-immune communication in shaping social behavior and human health
4. Whereas the deprivation and threat model focuses specifically on childhood adversity, Social Safety Theory adopts a life 
course perspective on human health and behavior
