Objective: This study explores whether a web-based physical activity (PA)
intervention grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) and motivationalinterviewing (MI) is more effective and better appreciated than a traditionalweb-based PA intervention.
Design: A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing (1) I Move;
a web-based PA intervention based on SDT and MI, (2) Active Plus; atraditional web-based PA intervention and (3) a waiting list control condition.
Main outcome measures: Weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous PA and
weekly days with ≥30 min PA were measured through self-report at baseline
and at 3 and 6 months from baseline.Results: I Move achieved a small, but signi ﬁcant increase in weekly minutes
of moderate to vigorous PA, while Active Plus did not have a signi ﬁcant
impact on this outcome. Both interventions were effective in increasingweekly days with ≥30 min PA, whereas Active Plus yielded a greater effect
on this outcome.
Conclusion: Overall, the web-based PA intervention grounded in SDT and MI
did not outperform the traditional web-based PA intervention. Further researchshould reveal whether this type of intervention is pro ﬁtable for long-term
maintenance of PA levels.

Background
Web-based computer tailored physical activity (PA) interventions are a promising
approach to promote PA. In these interventions, the content is automatically adapted toeach participant ’s characteristics, which enables the provision of personally relevant
information. This approach increases the likelihood of positive PA outcomes comparedto a non-tailored, generic approach (Broekhuizen, Kroeze, van Poppel, Oenema, &Brug,
2012 ; Enwald & Huotari, 2010 ; Lustria et al., 2013 ). Moreover, by using the
internet as the delivery channel, large numbers of people who are not suf ﬁciently active
can be reached, while maintaining relatively low costs (del Hoyo-Barbolla, Kukafka,

Arredondo, & Ortega, 2006 ; Lustria et al., 2013 ; Peels et al., 2012 ). The ﬁndings of a
meta-analysis suggest that web-based computer tailored PA interventions have thepotential of producing small but signi ﬁcant increases in PA (Davies, Spence,
Vandelanotte, Caperchione, & Mummery,
2012 ).
Until now, most web-based computer tailored PA interventions have been based on
traditional health behaviour theories such as social cognitive theory (SCT), self-regulation theory (SRT), the trans-theoretical model (TTM), and the theory of plannedbehaviour (TPB) (Davies et al.,
2012 ). As a result of using these theories, interventions
of this type, hereafter referred to as ‘traditional interventions ’, are rather directive and
instructive, which may not be the optimal method when it comes to promoting PAchange (Hillsdon, Thorogood, White, & Foster,
2002 ; Patrick, Resnicow, Teixeira, &
Williams, 2013 ). Indeed, current research on PA promotion increasingly shows the
importance of encouraging autonomous motivation (Patrick et al., 2013 ; Teixeira,
Carraça, Markland, Silva, & Ryan, 2012 ). When an individual is autonomously
motivated, behaviour is self-endorsed (Deci & Ryan, 2008 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ; Ryan,
Patrick, Deci, & Williams, 2008 ). Someone who is autonomously motivated to partici-
pate in sports, for instance, does not feel pressured to go to the gym, but experiences asense of volition or self-endorsement in doing so. Substantial evidence suggests that thegreater the autonomous motivation the higher the PA frequency and that autonomousmotivation is especially important for maintenance of PA behaviour (Teixeira et al.,
2012 ). Although motivation (or intention) is a common construct in research on
health behaviour change, the quality of motivation is not accounted for in traditionalhealth behaviour theories. Autonomous motivation does not play a role in traditionalhealth behaviour theories such as SCT, SRT, TTM or TPB, but it is a key construct inself-determination theory (SDT) and motivational interviewing (MI) (Miller & Rollnick,
2013 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ). Therefore, web-based computer tailored PA interventions
based on SDT and MI could be more effective in promoting PA behaviour thantraditional web-based computer tailored interventions.
In this paper, we aim to explore whether a web-based computer tailored PA
interventions grounded in SDT and MI is more effective and better appreciated thanweb-based PA interventions based on traditional health behaviour theories such as SCT,SRT, TTM and TPB. First, however, we provide some more background on SDT andMI in the context of PA and PA interventions.
Self-determination theory & motivational interviewing
SDT is a broad-based theory of human motivation (Deci & Ryan,
2008 ; Ryan & Deci,
2000 ; Ryan et al., 2008 ). The literature indicates that this theory can be especially help-
ful for understanding PA motivation (Teixeira et al., 2012 ). One of the main principles
of SDT is that motivation varies in the extent to which it is experienced as autonomousor controlled (Deci & Ryan,
2008 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ). Researchers hypothesise that
activities mainly driven by controlled forms of motivation generate intrapersonal con ﬂ-
ict which hinders the availability of volitional resources such as the capacity to exertsustained effort (Koestner, Otis, Powers, Pelletier, & Gagnon,
2008 ). Although con-
trolled motivation may sometimes cause short-lived behaviour change, it is expected
not to be capable of inducing maintenance of behaviour (Deci & Ryan, 2008 ; Markland908 S.A.H. Friederichs et al.
& Ingledew, 2007 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ; Teixeira et al., 2012 ). Individuals who are
autonomously motivated to be active often display many positive emotions, high levelsof perceived behavioural competence and re ﬂective self-endorsement, and are typically
willing to engage in the behaviour for prolonged periods of time (Teixeira et al.,
2012 ).
Therefore, these individuals are usually more likely to engage in maintained PA
behaviour than those who are merely driven by controlling motives (Deci & Ryan,
2008 ; Markland & Ingledew, 2007 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ; Teixeira et al., 2012 ).
SDT states that there are three basic psychological needs that must be supported in
order for an individual to develop autonomous motivation. These are (1) the need forautonomy (e.g. the need the need to experience our actions as result of autonomouschoice), (2) the need for competence (the need to feel competent and con ﬁdent) and (3)
the need for relatedness (the need to feel connected to and understood by others) (Deci
& Ryan,
2008 ; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ). These needs can be either supported or thwarted
by the social environment (which, for example, can be a friend, a ﬁtness instructor, or a
PA counsellor). Autonomous motivation is most likely to arise in an individual whenall three basic psychological needs are supported (Deci & Ryan,
2008 ; Ryan & Deci,
2000 ; Ryan et al., 2008 ). Several authors argue that these basic psychological needs can
be supported by skilfully applying the key principles of MI (Markland, Ryan, Tobin, &Rollnick,
2005 ; Patrick et al., 2013 ; Patrick & Williams, 2012 ; Vansteenkiste &
Sheldon, 2006 ; Vansteenkiste, Williams, & Resnicow, 2012 ).
MI is de ﬁned as ‘a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person ’s own
motivation and commitment to change ’(Miller & Rollnick, 2013 ). The core or ‘spirit ’of
MI encompasses principles of partnership (i.e. counsellor and client are considered equalcollaborators in the behaviour change process), acceptance and compassion (i.e. the coun-sellor displays profound acceptance for the client, and a priority for the client ’s needs)
and evocation (i.e. the clients already have much of what is needed within them and thecounsellor ’s task is to help ﬁnd it). Along with these principles, four overlapping pro-
cesses are discerned in MI: (1) engaging (involving the client in the counselling process
and establishing a trusting and respectful helping relationship between client and counsel-
lor), (2) focusing (collaboratively ﬁnding topics for conversation and consultation), (3)
evoking (eliciting the client ’s own motivation for change by prompting self-determined
motivational statements or change talk) and (4) planning (collaboratively developing aspeciﬁc change plan). To carry out these principles and processes, the practice of MI
implies applying speci ﬁc communication skills: asking open questions, af ﬁrming, re ﬂec-
tive listening, summarising and informing or advising (Miller & Rollnick,
2013 ).
Although SDT and MI were developed independently of one another, several schol-
ars propose that SDT can offer a theoretical framework for deepening our understanding
of the effects of MI (Markland et al., 2005 ; Patrick et al., 2013 ; Patrick & Williams,
2012 ; Vansteenkiste & Sheldon, 2006 ; Vansteenkiste et al., 2012 ). More precisely, it is
argued that the speci ﬁc strategies in MI can be used to support the client ’s basic psy-
chological needs for competence (e.g. by limiting negative feedback and providing opti-mally challenging tasks), autonomy (e.g. by taking the perspective of the client,supporting their choices, and minimising pressure) and relatedness (e.g. by creating anempathetic and positive environment, and showing unconditional regard). As such,
researchers propose the practical strategies from MI can be used to put the theoretical
foundation of SDT into practice (Markland et al.,
2005 ; Patrick et al., 2013 ; Patrick &
Williams, 2012 ; Vansteenkiste & Sheldon, 2006 ; Vansteenkiste et al., 2012 ).Psychology & Health 909
Over the recent past years, quite a few counselling PA interventions that combine
the theoretical framework of SDT with the practical strategies from MI have beendeveloped and evaluated in randomized controlled trials (Duda et al.,
2014 ; Fortier,
Duda, Guerin, & Teixeira, 2012 ; Fortier et al., 2007, 2011 ; Jolly et al., 2009 ; Silva
et al., 2011, 2008, 2010, 2010 ; Van Hoecke, Delecluse, Bogaerts, & Boen, 2014 ;V a n
Hoecke et al., 2013 ). In general these studies show that SDT/MI-based PA interventions
can be effective in increasing PA.
SDT and MI in web-based computer tailored PA interventions
Web-based computer tailored PA interventions grounded in SDT and using the
communication style and principles from MI, may be promising for large-scale PA pro-
motion. Compared to traditional web-based computer tailored interventions, web-based
computer tailored interventions grounded in SDT and MI may enhance interventioneffects because of the focus on promoting autonomous motivation. Web-based computertailored PA interventions based on traditional health behaviour theories such as SCT,SRT, TTM and TPB have a strong focus on providing participants with persuasive mes-sages and tips on how to become more physically active (Davies et al.,
2012 ). An
SDT/MI-based approach would pay attention to supporting the participant ’s basic psy-
chological needs. This approach could allow autonomous motivation to increase that in
turn would lead to heightened PA levels and its maintenance over time (Patrick et al.,
2013 ; Teixeira et al., 2012 ). In addition, because of the participant-centred approach, a
web-based computer tailored PA intervention based on MI and SDT might lead to betteruser appreciation, compared to a traditional intervention. The current study aimed to testthese premises by comparing a MI/SDT-based PA intervention to a traditional one.
Although SDT postulates that all humans have the same basic psychological needs,
previous studies on tailored PA interventions have shown that participant characteristicssuch as age, gender, BMI, intention to be physically active at baseline and PA at base-
line can in ﬂuence the effects of tailored PA interventions (Peels et al.,
2013, 2014 ; Spit-
taels & De Bourdeaudhuij, 2007 ;V a n ‘t Riet, Crutzen, & De Vries, 2010 ; van Stralen,
de Vries, Bolman, Mudde, & Lechner, 2010 ). This is relevant in the context of our
study, since the impact of both our interventions might be more pronounced in sub-groups of participants with speci ﬁc characteristics. Therefore, the present study also
aimed to identify participant characteristics that modify the intervention effects, by con-ducting moderator analyses. These analyses will include variables that moderated theeffects of tailored interventions in earlier studies such as age, gender, BMI, intention to
be physically active at baseline and PA at baseline (Peels et al.,
2013, 2014 ; Spittaels &
De Bourdeaudhuij, 2007 ;V a n ‘t Riet et al., 2010 ; van Stralen et al., 2010 ). The moder-
ator analyses will identify in which participant subgroups the SDT/MI-based and thetraditional intervention exert the greatest effects, enabling a more in-depth view on theimpact of both interventions. The results of these analyses will potentially yield recom-mendations for future intervention development (van Stralen et al.,
2010 ). Based on ear-
lier literature, it was hypothesised that the effects of both interventions would be higherin female participants (since women tend to be more actively involved in interventions
than men) older participants (since they usually participate more actively than younger
participants), participants with high education (since they have more advancedself-regulatory skills than lowly educated participants), participants with high intention910 S.A.H. Friederichs et al.
to be physically active (since these participants will be most willing to increase their
PA) and participants who were relatively inactive at baseline and had high BMI(because much progression can be gained among these participants) (Peels et al.,
2013,
2014 ; Spittaels & De Bourdeaudhuij, 2007 ;V a n ‘t Riet et al., 2010 ; van Stralen et al.,
2010 ).
Method
A randomized controlled trial was conducted, which was approved by the Medical
Ethics Committee of Atrium-Orbis-Zuyd and was registered with the Dutch TrialRegister (NTR 4129).
Participants and procedure
Individuals were eligible for participation in this trial when they were between 18
and 70 years old, did not have a condition that seriously hinders their ability to bephysically active, did not take part in one of the pilot studies (Friederichs, Bolman,Oenema, Guyaux, & Lechner,
2014 ; Friederichs et al., 2013 ), and when they were
less physically active than 5 days per week for 60 min per day (Friederichs et al.,
2014 ). Based on a power calculation (ES = .25; power = .80), it was estimated that
data of 600 participants would be needed for this study. Based on an expected drop-
out of 40 –70% (Elfeddali, Bolman, Candel, Wiers, & de Vries, 2012 ; Peels et al.,
2013 ), it was estimated that a minimum of 2000 respondents would be needed to
enrol in the study.
The study procedure and ﬂow of participants is shown in Figure 1. In September-
December 2013, participants were recruited by means of advertisements (containing alink to the study website) in national newspapers, social media and via an online panel.At the study website, individuals were given the option to participate in the study by
clicking on the ‘I want to participate ’button. After passing through the inclusion ques-
tions and granting informed consent, participants were randomized into one of the threeresearch conditions (1:1:1) by means of a digital randomizer built into the website, andwere asked to ﬁll in the baseline questionnaire. The three research conditions in this
study are: (1) the I Move condition; participants in this condition receive I Move, whichis a web-based computer tailored PA intervention based on MI and SDT (Friederichset al.,
2014 ), (2) the Active Plus condition; participants in this condition receive Active
Plus, which is a traditional web-based computer tailored PA intervention, based on theo-
ries such as TPB, SCT, SRT and TTM (Peels et al., 2012 ; van Stralen et al., 2008 ) and
(3) the control condition, which is a waiting list control group.
Measurements were taken at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months from baseline. All
measurements were taken by web-based questionnaires via the study website.Participants from the two intervention conditions were also asked to ﬁll in a question-
naire at 6 weeks from baseline. This questionnaire contains questions that are used totailor the intervention content, as well as questions on process evaluations. In order todecrease attrition, 10 prizes of €50 were raf ﬂed among those participants who have
completed each questionnaire (Robroek, van Lenthe, van Empelen, & Burdorf,
2009 ).

Interventions
I Move is a web-based computer tailored PA intervention, aimed at increasing and
maintaining PA among adults (Friederichs et al., 2014 ). The intervention is based on
the theoretical insights of SDT and the practical applications of MI. Since developinginterventions in a systemically planned way increases the likelihood of effectiveness(Brug, Oenema, & Ferreira,
2005 ), we used the Intervention Mapping protocol
(Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, Gottlieb, & Fernandez, 2011 ) to develop I Move. In I
Move several practical applications derived from MI have been implemented. In orderto do so, we converted the skills, processes and spirit of MI into web-based CT (Miller& Rollnick,
2013 ). Throughout this process, SDT was used as the underlying theoretical
framework (Markland et al., 2005 ).
I Move entails four automated text-based sessions. During these sessions, partici-
pants answer several questions (either by typing in their answer or choosing theiranswer from a list). In between those questions they receive tailored feedback text mes-sages. As such, a motivational dialogue is simulated between the intervention and theparticipant. Alongside the text-based sections, at regular times during the intervention,participants are offered the option to watch short videos (starring a programme host, aPA-expert and four allegedly former intervention participants). Session 1 starts with an
introduction, and after that several topics are discussed such as the participant ’s current
PA, how important he/she thinks it is to increase his/her PA level, and how con ﬁdent
he/she is with regards to becoming more physically active. Participants can choose tomake an action plan to become more active. Three weeks and six weeks later, partici-pants receive an invitation email for session 2 and 3, respectively. Session 2 and 3 gointo further detail on importance and con ﬁdence of becoming more physically active.
Participants are given the opportunity to evaluate and adjust their plans, and to formu-late coping plans. During session 3, participants receive ipsative feedback on their PA
level. Three months after session 1, participants receive an invitation email for session
4. In this session, participants are given the option to choose themselves which parts ofthe session they want to go through (ipsative feedback on PA, long-term motivation andconﬁdence). The day after having completed an intervention session, participants
receive a PDF ﬁle by email, containing a summary of the session. Table
1shows how
the principles and strategies from SDT and MI were implemented in I Move. For moredetailed information on the content and basis of I Move, please see the separate studyprotocol paper (Friederichs et al.,
2014 ).
Active Plus is a traditional web-based computer tailored PA intervention (Peels
et al., 2012 ; van Stralen et al., 2008 ). This systematically developed, theory- and evi-
dence-based intervention is predominantly founded on traditional health behaviourchange theories such as TPB, SCT, SRT and TTM. Active Plus, aimed at PA increaseand maintenance, entails three times a tailored advice, (Peels et al.,
2012 ; van Stralen
et al., 2008 ). The format of the tailored advice is mostly text-based, supplemented by
pictures and short videos. The content of each tailored advice is adjusted on the basisof several psychosocial constructs such as awareness, knowledge, attitude, self-ef ﬁcacy,
modelling and action planning (Peels et al.,
2012 ; van Stralen et al., 2008 ). The main
structure of each tailored advice depends on the participant ’s motivational stage of
change (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997 ). For instance, the ﬁrst tailored advice for
precontemplators and contemplators mainly addresses attitude and modelling, whereasPsychology & Health 913

Relatedness
supportProcesses: engaging At the start of the intervention it is stated that
participants are experts about themselves. Each of
the four sessions contains a video coach; a series of
video messages in which a coach welcomes theparticipant, and brie ﬂy introduces new questions and
exercises. Furthermore, at several moments
throughout all four sessions, participants can watch
short videos with narratives of four allegedly formerparticipants of I Move. These narratives provide theopportunity for the participants to feel connected
with other people who go through similar
experiences as themselves
Spirit: partnership The intervention uses the participants ’input as the
starting point for each session, in order to create a
collaborative conversation
Spirit: acceptance andcompassionThe intervention contains highly speci ﬁc feedback
messages that suit well to the participants ’needs and
wishes. All messages are written in an empathetic
style, without coercion or blame914 S.A.H. Friederichs et al.
preparators, actors and maintainers receive more information on post-motivational con-
structs such as action planning. Since Active Plus was originally designed for individu-als over 50 years, we adapted the intervention in such a way that it is appropriate forthe general adult population; messages that were clearly aimed at elderly people were
adapted or removed. Furthermore, the original Active Plus contains only three times a
tailored advice. Therefore, one additional tailored advice was added, in order to make itoptimally comparable to I Move. Participants in Active Plus receive the tailored advicein two ways: (1) they are invited to read the advice and watch the related videos online,at the study website, and (2) one day after a new tailored advice has become available,they receive a PDF ﬁle by email, containing the tailored advice (videos replaced by pic-
tures).
As emerges from the above, I Move and Active Plus are both systemically developed
web-based computer tailored PA interventions. Both of these interventions entail four ‘in-
tervention moments ’and in both interventions participants receive PDF ﬁles by email,
containing the content of the previous session/advice. Nonetheless there are also severalimportant differences between the interventions, one of which concerns the degree ofinteractivity. In Active Plus, participants are ﬁrst asked to ﬁll in a questionnaire on all the
relevant psychological constructs, and they then receive the complete advice at once. IMove was designed to simulate a conversation with the participant by means of an inter-active question-feedback approach. Hence, the participant is asked to actively participate
in the intervention by responding to the questions, and reading the feedback messages. In
addition, several other differences between both interventions exist, many of which stemfrom the differing theoretical foundations. Many differences are related to the fact that IMove provides more autonomy support. For example, right at the start of I Move, thecollaborative character of the intervention is explicated by stating that the participant ishis or her own expert, which is not the case in Active Plus. Similarly, before being pro-vided with information on PA, participants in I Move are ﬁrst asked whether they would
like to read some more about the bene ﬁcial effects of PA, while in Active Plus no
permission is asked and information is simply provided. In Table
2the most important
similarities and differences between both interventions are summarised.
Questionnaire
Demographics
Age, gender, weight, height, relational status and highest completed educational level
were assessed. Educational level was categorised into high (higher vocational school oruniversity level) and low (elementary education, medium general secondary education,preparatory vocational school, lower vocational school, higher general secondary educa-tion, preparatory academic education, medium vocational school), according to theDutch educational system.
PA intention
At baseline, intention to become suf ﬁciently active was measured, since this can be an
important predictor of dropout in web-based PA interventions (Peels et al.,
2013 ).
Intention to become suf ﬁciently active was measured with three items (e.g. ‘Are you
planning to be suf ﬁciently physically active? ’Deﬁnitely not (1) –Yes, de ﬁnitely (10)).Psychology & Health 915
PA level
At baseline, 3 and 6 months, PA behaviour was measured using the validated self-ad-
ministered Dutch Short Questionnaire to Assess Health Enhancing PA (SQUASH)(Wendel-Vos, Schuit, Saris, & Kromhout,
2003 ).
Total weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was calcu-
lated by multiplying the frequency (how many days per week), and duration (how
many hours and minutes per day) of leisure and transport walking, leisure and transport
cycling, sports, gardening, household chores and odd jobs performed with moderate orvigorous intensity. The relative validity ( r
spearman = .45; 95% CI = .17 –.66) and repro-
ducibility ( rspearman = .58; 95% CI = .36 –.74) of the SQUASH are reasonable for the
general adult population (Wendel-Vos et al., 2003 ).
Total weekly days with more than 30 min PA was measured by a single item: ‘How
many days per week are you, in total, moderately physically active by undertaking, forexample, brisk walking, cycling, chores, gardening, sports, or other physical activities
for at least 30 min? ’. Prior research provided support for the validity and reliability ofTable 2. General similarities and differences between both interventions.

single-item self-reports of PA (Milton, Bull, & Bauman, 2011 ; Milton, Clemes, & Bull,
2013 ) and several studies found the single item PA measure to be among the most
accurate PA questionnaires, when compared to accelerometer output (van Poppel,Chinapaw, Mokkink, van Mechelen, & Terwee,
2010 ).
Process evaluation measures
At 6 weeks and 6 months from baseline, appreciation for the interventions was evalu-
ated. Participants were asked to indicate on a seven-point scale how useful, understand-able, trustworthy, personally relevant and motivating they perceived the content of thesessions/tailored advice to be. Furthermore, participants were asked to provide anoverall appreciation score (minimum 1; maximum 10) for each session / advice. These
questions were derived from another PA CT intervention study (van Stralen, de Vries,
Mudde, Bolman, & Lechner,
2009a, 2009b ).
SDT measures
At 6 weeks and at 6 months from baseline, perceived basic psychological need support
was measured, using nine especially developed items. At baseline and at 3 months frombaseline several SDT variables (e.g. intrinsic motivation, perceived choice, perceived
competence) were measured using the Exercise Self-Regulation Questionnaire (Ryan &
Connell,
1989 ) and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (McAuley, Duncan, & Tammen,
1989 ). These SDT measures are reported on in a separate paper on the mediated effects
or processes of change of the I Move intervention (Friederichs, Bolman, Oenema,Verboon, & Lechner,
2016 ), and are therefore not featured in the current paper.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows (Version 22). According to the
guidelines of the SQUASH, participants who reported over 6720 min PA per week wereexcluded from all analyses (Wendel-Vos et al.,
2003 ).
Chi-square tests and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to
identify potential baseline differences among the research conditions. Logistic regressionanalyses were performed to assess predictors of dropout at the 6 month measurement.
Measurement moments (at 3 months and at 6 months) were nested within partici-
pants, resulting in the likelihood of interdependence. Therefore, multilevel linear regres-
sion analyses were conducted with random intercepts for two levels (time and
participant). To account for possible selective drop-out, analyses were conducted usingthe whole data-set, including missing data. Applying multilevel analyses to an incom-plete data-set has been shown to give better estimations than using multiple imputation(Twisk,
2013 ).
For the main outcome analyses, both PA outcomes (weekly days with ≥30 min PA
and weekly minutes of MVPA) were regressed on two dummies (one for both of theintervention conditions, using the control group as the reference). The following vari-
ables were included as covariates: baseline PA value (minutes and days), time, gender,
age, educational level, relational status, BMI and intention to be suf ﬁciently physically
active. Cohen ’sdeffect sizes (ESs) were computed for both intervention conditions onPsychology & Health 917
the basis of the unstandardised regression coef ﬁcients and the pooled standard deviation
of the outcome measure (Lipsey & Wilson, 2000 ). Effect sizes of .15, .20 and .25,
respectively, were considered small, medium and large (Rossi, 2003 ).
To gain more insight into the intervention effects among those participants who
were exposed to the total intervention, separate multilevel linear regression analyses
were conducted for both PA outcomes. These analyses included (1) those participantsfrom the I Move condition who completed all four sessions, (2) those participants fromthe Active Plus condition who went through all four rounds of advice and (3) allparticipants from the control condition.
Moderators
In order to assess whether the intervention effects on both PA outcomes were moderated
by participant characteristics, a second series of multilevel regression analyses was con-ducted. This time, interaction terms between the intervention dummies and gender, age,educational level, relational status, BMI and intention to be suf ﬁciently physically active
were added to the model. Separate moderation analyses were performed for each of theuser characteristics. If an interaction term had a P-value < .1 this interaction was
decomposed (using a median split in case of a continuous variable) and subgroup analy-ses were performed (Groeneveld, Proper, van der Beek, Hildebrandt, & van Mechelen,
2011 ; Rodenburg, Kremers, Oenema, & van de Mheen, 2014 ; Rodenburg, Oenema,
Kremers, & van de Mheen, 2012 ; Rosnow & Rosenthal, 1989 ; van der Horst et al.,
2007 ).
Process evaluation
First, in order to get an indication of the intervention exposure, it was assessed how
many participants in the Active Plus condition clicked through at least one web-
based advice, and how many participants in the I Move condition completed at least
one web-based session. Also, it was assessed how many participants (from the IMove and the Active Plus condition) went through all four sessions/rounds of advice.Potential group differences within the process evaluation scores were assessed bymeans of multivariate and univariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs and ANO-VAs). The ﬁrst MANOVA assessed potential group differences in the extent to which
participants perceived the content of session / advice 1 and 2 as useful, understand-able, trustworthy, personally relevant and motivating. A second MANOVA evaluated
potential group differences within the same variables, but this time for session /
advice 3 and 4. These two MANOVAs only included those participants who com-pleted at least one out of two of the intervention moments of interest (either session/ advice 1 and 2 or 3 and 4). Both MANOVAs were followed by univariate ANO-VAs to check for group differences in the individual variables. Finally, four ANOVAswere conducted to identify potential group differences on the overall appreciationscores for the four intervention moments. These four ANOVAs only included thoseparticipants who did complete the intervention moment of interest (either session /
advice 1, 2, 3 or 4).918 S.A.H. Friederichs et al.
Results
In Figure 1, an overview of the ﬂow of participants in the study is presented. As shown in
Table 3, no baseline differences on key characteristics were found between the three study
conditions. Dropout analysis showed that the lower their age ( B= .019 ± .003; P< .001),
the higher their BMI ( B= .023 ± .008; p= .005) and the lower their intention to be suf ﬁ-
ciently physically active ( B= .076 ± .022; P< .001), the less likely participants were to
ﬁll in the 6-month PA questionnaire. In addition, the more weekly minutes of MVPA they
reported at baseline (B < .001 ± .000; P< .001) and the less weekly days with > 30 min
PA they reported at baseline ( B= .090 ± .024; P< .001) the less likely participants were
toﬁll in the 6 month PA questionnaire. Finally, participants were less likely to ﬁll in the
6 month PA questionnaire if they were married or living together (OR = 1.19; 95%
CI = 1.00 –1.42), if they were lowly educated (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.15 –1.57; P< .001)
and if they were randomized in one of the intervention conditions (OR IMove = 3.49; 95%
CI = 2.89 –4.22; P< .001; OR ActivePlus = 3.17; 95% CI = 2.64 –3.81; P< .001). These pre-
dictors of dropout were included in the effect analyses as covariates.
Table 4shows the actual PA values for the three research conditions at baseline and
at 6 months from baseline. In Table 5, the intervention effects on the one item measure
of weekly days with ≥30 min PA and weekly minutes of MVPA, in comparison to the
control condition, are shown. I Move realised a small, but signi ﬁcant, effect in weekly
minutes of MVPA ( B= 54.55; p= .027; ES = .09). Active Plus did not effectuate a sig-
niﬁcant effect regarding minutes of PA ( B= 40.86; p= .073; ES = .07). Regarding days
with≥30 min PA, I Move realised a medium sized effect ( B= .40; p< .001; ES = .21).
Active Plus realised a large effect on this outcome ( B= .65; p< .001; ES = .35).
The analyses including only those participants who were exposed to the total inter-
vention yielded comparable results. In these analyses, the I Move intervention induceda signi ﬁcant effect on weekly minutes of MVPA ( B= 72.150; p= .013; ES = .12) while
the Active Plus intervention did not effectuate a signi ﬁcant effect on this outcome

days with ≥30 min PA ( B= .46; p< .001; ES = .26). Active Plus also induced a signi ﬁ-
cant effect on this outcome ( B= .73; p< .001; ES = .40).
Moderators
Age moderated the effect of I Move on weekly minutes of MVPA ( p= .015) and on
weekly days with ≥30 min PA ( p= .067). Gender also moderated the effect of I Move
on weekly minutes of MVPA ( p= .081) and on weekly days with ≥30 min PA
(p= .032). Furthermore, the effect of I Move on weekly minutes of MVPA was moder-
ated by relational status ( p= .074). Finally, the effect of Active Plus on weekly days
with≥30 min PA was moderated by BMI ( p= .021). PA (days and minutes) and inten-
tion at baseline did not moderate the intervention effects nor did educational level.Table
6shows the intervention effects on both PA outcomes for the different subgroups.
Regarding weekly minutes of MVPA, I Move was effective in producing a signi ﬁ-
cant effect in male participants ( B= 117.52; p= .011; ES = .20), participants aged 47 –
70 ( B= 86.08; p= .026; ES = .15), and participants who were single ( B= 125.61;

or living together ( B= 27.31; p= .338; ES = .05). Active Plus did not produce signi ﬁ-
cant effects on weekly minutes of MVPA in any of these subgroups.
Regarding weekly days with ≥30 min PA, I Move produced greater effects in male
participants ( B= .64; p< .001; ES = .35), compared to female participants ( B= .29;
p= .004; ES = .15). The effect of I Move on weekly days with ≥30 min PA was moreTable 4. Absolute PA levels at baseline and 6 months.

Process evaluation
In total, 73.5% of the I Move participants completed at least one web-based session,
while 89.4% of the Active Plus participants fully clicked through at least one web-
based advice ( χ2(1,N= 2069) = 87.79, p< .001). Furthermore, 24.6% of the I Move
participants completed all four sessions, while 12.6% of the Active Plus participantsclicked through all four rounds of advice ( χ2 (1, N= 2069) = 49.17, p< .001). On aver-
age, 88% (I Move) and 83% (Active Plus) gave the intervention materials a rating of 6/10 or higher. As is shown in Table
7, session 2 of I Move was better appreciated than
advice 2 of Active Plus ( F= 5.80; p= .016). Furthermore, session 1 and 2 of I Move
were perceived as less trustworthy ( F= 4.24; p= .040) and as more motivating
(F= 5.26; p= .022) than session 1 and 2 of Active Plus. Finally, session 3 & 4 of I
Move were experienced as more understandable than advice 3 and 4 of the Active Plus
condition ( F= 4.80; p= .029).
Discussion
This study evaluated the effectiveness of I Move, a web-based computer tailored PA
intervention, based on SDT and MI. I Move was compared to a proven effective tradi-tional web-based PA intervention (Active Plus) and to a waiting list control group. In
addition, potential moderating factors of the intervention effects were explored. Finally,
by conducting a process evaluation, user appreciation for both interventions wasinvestigated.Table 6. Intervention effects on PA outcomes in subgroups.

I Move achieved a small, but signi ﬁcant increase in weekly minutes of MVPA,
while Active Plus did not have a signi ﬁcant impact on this outcome. In contrast to our
hypothesis, however, the difference in effect sizes between both interventions on thisoutcome (I Move ES = .09 vs Active Plus ES = .07) was negligible. This may be
related to the rather limited intervention exposure in the I Move condition. Indeed, the
percentage of Active Plus participants who fully clicked through at least one web-basedadvice was higher than the percentage of I Move participants who completed at leastone web-based session. One possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that engagement
with the intervention was lower among I Move participants than among Active Plusparticipants (O ’Brien & Toms,
2008 ). Due to its collaborative, interactive nature, I
Move could be experienced as more intensive and lengthy compared Active Plus, whichmay have had an negative impact on intervention use (Brouwer et al.,
2011 ; Ritterband,
Thorndike, Cox, Kovatchev, & Gonder-Frederick, 2009 ). However, reasoning from the
tenets of SDT and MI, a directive and advice-giving intervention such as Active Plusshould instead cause less engagement (Ryan et al.,
2008 ). This line of thought is in line
with our ﬁnding that the percentage of I Move participants who completed all four ses-
sions was signi ﬁcantly higher than the percentage of Active Plus participants who
clicked through all four rounds of advice. An alternative explanation for this, however,could be that the rounds of advice from Active Plus were also emailed to each Active

While overall, the effect of I Move on weekly minutes of MVPA was rather small
(ES = .09), in some subgroups (participants with higher age, male participants, partici-
pants who were single) the effect sizes for this outcome were more pronounced (ES
ranging from .15 to .22). The larger effect sizes in these particular groups probablyhave several causes. For instance, participants with higher age are generally moreinclined to take an active part in web-based interventions, compared to younger partici-pants (Schneider, van Osch, Schulz, Kremers, & de Vries,
2012 ;V a n ‘t Riet et al.,
2010 ). The fact that I Move was capable of achieving signi ﬁcant small to medium
effects on weekly minutes of MVPA (in some subgroups of participants), suggests thatcombining SDT and MI within a web-based PA interventions has the potential to effec-
tively increase daily PA behaviour. Nonetheless, it is possible that I Move should be
further adapted in order to better ful ﬁl the needs and wishes of certain subgroups such
as participants who are married or living together, and female participants. Indeed,future studies on web-based interventions altogether should examine how to designinterventions in such a way that the tailored content optimises engagement and impactin all participant subgroups (Chen, Reid, Parker, & Pillemer,
2013 ; Morrison, Yardley,
Powell, & Michie, 2012 ; Neville, O ’Hara, & Milat, 2009 ).
Both I Move and Active Plus were effective in increasing weekly days with ≥30
min PA, whereas Active Plus yielded a greater effect size on this outcome (I Move .21
vs Active Plus .35). Among other factors (such as the limited intervention exposure inthe I Move condition) these results may be related to the normative approach as opera-tionalised by Active Plus. During Active Plus, participants are continuously informedabout the importance of complying to the (inter)national PA guidelines (being physi-cally active for 30 min or more during at least 5 days per week) (Garber et al.,
2011 ;
Peels et al., 2012 ; van Stralen et al., 2008 ). In I Move, the PA guidelines are hardly
mentioned and participants are stimulated to set their own PA norms/goals (which are
not necessarily in line with the PA guidelines). Therefore, when compared to the Active
Plus participants, the I Move participants possibly concentrated their PA behaviour onfewer days in the week.
Active Plus was especially effective in increasing days with ≥30 min PA in over-
weight people. This phenomenon was also observed in an earlier study on a print-deliv-ered version of Active Plus (van Stralen et al.,
2010 ). The higher effect of Active Plus
on days with ≥30 min PA in participants with BMI > 25 could indicate that people with
overweight are more receptive to the normative health-related messages as provided by
Active Plus (Elliott, Baxter, Davies, & Truby, 2014 ; McMurray et al., 2008 ; Troiano,
Pettee Gabriel, Welk, Owen, & Sternfeld, 2012 ).
The results of the separate outcome analyses (including only those participants who
went through all intervention components), were comparable to the results of the origi-nal outcome analyses (with all participants, including those who skipped one or moreintervention components). The effect sizes in the completer-only analyses are very muchalike the effect sizes in the intention-to-treat analyses. This shows that, apparently, inthe context of interactive PA interventions like I Move, it is not of utmost importance
that all participants take part in all intervention sessions. For future intervention devel-
opers, it would be relevant to ﬁnd out whether there is a certain number of sessions is
optimal and whether this might vary between subpopulations.Psychology & Health 923
Overall, I Move and Active Plus were both fairly appreciated. Session 2 of I Move
was better appreciated than advice 2 of Active Plus. Possibly, this has to do with thefact that session 2 of I Move uses a partnership approach, and actively involves the par-ticipant by continuing the conversation of session 1 and adapting the feedback messages
to participant ’s current needs and wishes. Session 1 and 2 of I Move were perceived as
more motivating than advice 1 and 2 of Active Plus, which is in favour of the auton-omy-supportive approach as adopted by I Move. However, session 1 and 2 of I Movewere perceived as less trustworthy than advice 1 and 2 of Active Plus. This may indi-cate that, for some participants (e.g. participants who just wanted to receive guidelinesand tips about PA), the approach of I Move was too cumbersome, too little self-ex-planatory, and consequently perceived as less trustworthy (Patrick et al.,
2013 ). Also,
reasoning from a SDT context, this result may imply that there was too little structure
in the I Move intervention which may have thwarted the participants ’basic need for
competence (Ryan et al., 2008 ). Finally, the I Move participants scoring higher on the
motivation variable but lower on the trust variable seems contradictory. This ﬁnding
can be explained by the fact that the correlation between the motivation and trustvariable was slightly different among participants from the I Move vs. the Active Pluscondition.
Strengths and limitations
As far as is known to us, I Move is the ﬁrst web-based PA intervention based on SDT
and MI. In this intervention, new and innovative ways of motivating individuals tobecome physically active have been integrated. The innovative nature of I Move there-fore is an important strength of this study. Furthermore, this study had a strong random-ized controlled design, with a large sample size, and no baseline differences betweenthe study conditions. Also, self-reported PA was measured using a validated measure-ment instrument (Wendel-Vos et al.,
2003 ).
Despite these strengths, the current study is not without limitations. First, the study
was subject to a considerable amount of attrition. Unfortunately, attrition is very com-mon in studies on eHealth and web-based interventions (Eysenbach,
2005 ). In this
study, we aimed to handle the missing data in the most accurate way possible by con-ducting multilevel analyses (Twisk,
2013 ). Indeed, applying multilevel analyses to an
incomplete data-set has been shown to give better estimations than using multiple impu-tations (Twisk,
2013 ). Second, although the reproducibility and relative validity of the
measurement instrument in this study are reasonable (Wendel-Vos et al., 2003 ), the fact
that it is self-report leads to the probability of bias, for example via over reporting or
via socially desirable responses (Brouwer et al., 2011 ; Prince et al., 2008 ). Over report-
ing of PA behaviour is likely in this study since the mean BMI of the participants(26.0) is quite high compared with their self-reported PA level. The use of self-report asthe only outcome measure should therefore regarded as an important limitation of thisstudy. Future studies on web-based PA interventions should include a more objectivemeasure of PA behaviour (Lyons, Lewis, Mayrsohn, & Rowland,
2014 ; Trost & O ’Neil,
2014 ). Third, eligibility criteria of this study included the requirement that participants
be physically active for less than 5 days per week for 60 min per day. Therefore,
relatively active individuals were still allowed to take part in the study which couldhave led to a ceiling effect (predominantly in subparts of the sample with lots of active924 S.A.H. Friederichs et al.
individuals) and could partly explain the rather moderate observed intervention effects.
However, moderator analyses showed that baseline PA level did not signi ﬁcantly mod-
erate the intervention effects, arguing against a ceiling effect. Fourth, the results of thisstudy may be in ﬂuenced by selective drop-out (e.g. participants with lower age dropped
out more frequently). By including all drop-out predictors in the regression analyses as
covariates, and by analysing the total data-set including missing values, we aimed toaccount for selective drop-out as much as possible (Twisk,
2013 ). Finally, caution is
needed when generalising the main outcomes of this study to the general population,because of the overrepresentation of female and highly educated participants in theresearch population. By conducting the moderation analyses, however, we aimed to pro-vide insight into the differential effectiveness of the interventions in speci ﬁc subgroups
of participants.
Conclusions
In this study, I Move (a web-based computer tailored PA intervention based on MI and
SDT), did not outperform Active Plus (a web-based computer tailored PA interventionbased on traditional health behavioural theories). Further research should reveal whetherMI/SDT-based interventions are pro ﬁtable for long-term maintenance of PA levels. For
future studies in this domain, it is recommended to invest in prevention of
disengagement and attrition, and to include objective measures of PA.
