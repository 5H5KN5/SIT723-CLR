Abstract
Background: A number of children experience difficulties with social communication and this has long-term
deleterious effects on their mental health, social deve lopment and education. The proposal presented in this
article describes a feasibility stud y for a trial to test an intervention ( ‘E-PLAYS ’) aimed at supporting children
with social communication impairments. E-PLAYS harnesses technology in the form of a novel computer game in
order to develop collaborative and communication skills. Preliminary studies by the authors show that when E-PLAYS
was administered by the research team, children with social communication impairments showed improvements on
communication test scores and on observed collaborative behaviours. The study described here is a pragmatic trial to
test the application of E-PLAYS delivered by NHS speech and language therapists together with schools.
Methods: This protocol outlines a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled trial of the E-PLAYS intervention
with treatment as usual control arm, with randomisation at the level of the speech and language therapist. The aim of
this study is to ascertain whether it will be feasible to progress to running a full-scale definitive trial to test the
effectiveness of E-PLAYS in an NHS setting. Data relating to re cruitment and retention, the appropriateness of outcomes
and the acceptability of E-PLAYS to participants will be collected.
Speech and language therapists will select suitable children (ages 4 –7 years old) from their cas eloads and deliver either
the E-PLAYS intervention (experimental group) or treatment as usual (control group). Assessments will include blinded
language measures and observations, non -blinded teacher-reported measures of pe er relations and classroom behaviour
and parent-reported use of resources and quality of life. There will also be a qualitative process evaluation.
Discussion: The findings of this study will inform the decision as to whether to progress to a full-scale definitive
randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of E-PLAYS when delivered by speech and language therapists and
teaching assistants within schools. The use of technology in game form is a novel approach in an area where there are
currently few available interventions.
Trial registration: ISRCTN 14818949 (retrospectively registered).

Background
Children with social communi cation impairments experi-
ence difficulties with using linguistic context to understand
speakers ’meanings and, more broadly, with applying con-
ventional norms and expectations from the wider society to
relate to others [ 1]. To illustrate, children with social com-
munication impairments are likely to find it difficult to take
turns during conversation, ma intain a topic of conversation
appropriately, reco unt coherent narratives, respond contin-
gently, make inferences, understand non-literal language
such as jokes, irony or sarca sm, repair communication
breakdowns and generally fo llow conversational conven-
tions. Pragmatic language skill may be defined as selection
o ft h ea p p r o p r i a t em e s s a g eo ri nterpretation in relation to
t h ec o m m u n i c a t i v ec o n t e x t[ 2]. The terms ‘social commu-
nication ’and ‘pragmatic language ’are commonly used to
refer to similar skills.
Recent systematic reviews of interventions for ‘social
communication impairments ’or‘pragmatic language
impairments ’[3,4] have adopted broad definitions for
these terms encompassing both verbal and nonverbal as-
pects of communication to include abilities such as facial
expression recognition and production [ 5]. Whilst the
terms ‘social communication ’and ‘pragmatic skill ’have
often been used interchangeably in the research litera-
ture [ 1], for the current proposal, we follow the sugges-
tion by Matthew et al. [ 6] and define ‘pragmatics ’more
specifically as the linguistic component (excluding facial
communication and other non-verbal communication)
of social communication.
Children with social co mmunication impairments
are a heterogeneous group a nd encompass both clin-
ical and non-clinical groups . Clinical groups include
the categories of ‘Language Impairment ’(also com-
monly known as ‘Specific Language Impairment ’and,
more recently, ‘Developmental Language Disorder ’),
‘Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder ’and
‘Autism Spectrum Disorders ’as defined in the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-V; [ 7]). ICD 10 [ 8]a sw e l la sl i s t i n gan u m b e r
of pervasive developmental disorders (autism, Asper-
ger’s and other pervasive developmental disorders)
also describes a number of developmental disorders
of language. Children experiencing difficulties with
social communication are not limited to those cov-
ered by these DSM-V and ICD 10 diagnoses, how-
ever. Social communication and pragmatic language
difficulties have also been shown to be associated with
other clinical populations, notably those with ADHD [ 9]
or conduct disorder [ 10,11] and non-clinical groups such
as shy children [ 12,13]. There are also indications that so-
cial communication disorders are severely under-diag-
nosed, particularly in children of low socio-economic
status [ 10,14].Research concerning children identified as having
pragmatic language difficulties demonstrates that effects
are far-reaching. Recent studies have shown associations
between pragmatic language difficulties and behavioural
problems [ 15], especially of the disruptive, externalising
kind. Healthcare costs (excluding education costs) have
been shown to be 36% higher for 4-year-old children
with language disorders than for typically developing
children [ 16]. A number of studies have shown long-term
negative effects: children with social communication im-
pairments experience problematic peer relationships [ 17]
and are commonly rejected and victimised by peers at
school [ 18,19]. Individuals diagnosed with pragmatic lan-
guage impairments as children were found to experience
continuing problems with establishing social relationships
(such as friendships) later in adulthood [ 20].
A particularly important skill for successful adult func-
tioning, to which social communication is central, is the
ability to collaborate with others. Collaborative and
team-building skills are recognised as vital to future
adult employment and participation in society [ 21]. A
number of collaborative activities between children (such
as collaborative learning, cooperative learning or peer
tutoring) now commonly take place in classrooms and
have generally been judged to be beneficial in terms of
improved learning (e.g., [ 22,23,24]). Collaborative
working has also been shown to improve peer relations
and facilitate children ’s feelings of belonging [ 25,26].
However, group and dyadic work is not invariably benefi-
cial, only collaborations where children are actively engaged
and that are characterised by hi gh-quality questioning, ex-
planation, clarification of i deas, discussion and generally
positive affect have been found to be productive [ 21].
Given their difficulties, it is to be expected that chil-
dren with social communication impairments will strug-
gle with collaborative group working and recent studies
do indeed bear this out. By comparison to typically de-
veloping children in collaborative contexts, they can be
aggressive or withdrawn [ 27], show more irrelevant be-
haviours and share less [ 28], ignore others ’questions
and requests and give poorer directions [ 29].
Interventions to support pragmatic language and col-
laborative working are limited. The use of technology
and gaming has been highlighted as a positive tool for
facilitating communication and collaboration with peers
in children with communication difficulties (e.g. [ 30,
31]). The application of computer technology for collab-
orative games to support children ’s communication has
a number of unique advantages over non-technological
approaches. Children with social communication impair-
ments are frequently overwhelmed by the complexity
and unpredictability of social interaction. Computer
games designed for two or mor e children to play together
can be formatted so that they provide a ‘scaffold ’that guidesMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 2 of 13
and structures the interaction between children (for a re-
view, see [ 32]). Properly designed, use of a computer game
can support communication by s tructuring collaboration
between children so that they solve problems within a fun
environment together in partnership [ 33–35]. Typically, in
collaborative activities, chil dren with social communication
disorders either participate very little, lacking the confi-
dence to become involved or, alternatively, may attempt to
dominate and run the activity solely according to their own
agenda [ 27]. Managing these behaviours presents a serious
challenge for speech and langu age therapists, teachers and
teaching assistants [ 36]. Technology can be used to regulate
turn-taking, ensuring equal participation between all
players and preventing exclusion of any children. Further-
more, rule enforcement and rewa rd-giving (such as virtual
‘prizes ’) by a computer, rather than an adult, is viewed by
children as more consistent, fairer and less arbitrary [ 37].
The flexibility afforded can also be harnessed to sustain
children ’s interest and concentrat ion by adding surprises,
colourful animations and unusual sounds and keeping the
game flowing at a suitable pace [ 31,38].
We have developed and carried out initial testing for a
computer game intervention which aims to improve
pragmatic language skill and the ability to collaborate in
children with social communication impairments. Pre-
liminary efficacy testing for ‘E-PLAYS ’(formerly known
as the ‘Maze Game ’) is described in Murphy et al. [ 29,
39] on 32 children randomised either to the intervention
or to usual school practice. Children who received the
computer game intervention showed significant in-
creases on communication test scores, in the use of
high-quality questioning and listening skills and in their
positive ratings about collaborative work with peers [ 39].
It is important to note that for these studies, the inter-
vention was delivered to the children by a trained,
post-graduate psychology research assistant who was su-
pervised by the research team. This represents an ‘ideal ’
scenario for intervention and it is likely that results
would differ from implementation in ‘real-life ’by profes-
sionals who would not have the benefit of intensive
supervision, time and training. Successful implementa-
tion by the National Health Service (NHS) speech and
language teams throughout the UK would require the
E-PLAYS intervention to translate to a setting in which
speech and language therapists and teaching assistants
could learn to use it together without research team in-
put or supervision.
Following on from our preliminary work with
E-PLAYS [ 29,39] therefore, the aim of the present
study is to establish the feasibility of running a
full-scale clinical trial to evaluate its clinical- and
cost-effectiveness when implemented within the Na-
tional Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Speech and lan-
guage therapists are employed by and work within theNHS, but their day to day work frequently takes place
in the school setting, rather than in clinics, particularly
for young children.
This feasibility study will explore potential challenges
and aim to develop a protocol for a follow-on large-scale
RCT. Specific objectives include testing the recruitment
procedure and recording the number of participants re-
cruited over time. An important aspect will focus on de-
termining treatment fidelity ; E-PLAYS will be delivered
by teaching assistants who have been trained by NHS
speech and language therapists. We will also aim to es-
tablish the acceptability of E-PLAYS with speech and
language therapists and with teachers, teaching assis-
tants, parents and children and also explore the accept-
ability of randomisation to a control group. We will also
seek to determine the feasibility of collecting resource-
use data and quality of life measures for the purpose of
calculating relative cost-effectiveness .
Method
Design
The design is a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised
controlled trial (cRCT) with randomisation at the
level of the speech and language therapist (SLT). Each
participating child receiving the E-PLAYS intervention
will be a child with social communication impair-
ments. For each participating child, there will be an
associated teacher and parent who will complete
questionnaires, a speech and language therapist and
teaching assistant who will deliver the intervention
and a typically developing child from the same class
who will partner the child to play the E-PLAYS game.
For ease of reference, these will be called ‘participant
groups ’; each participant group comprises one child
with communication impairment, plus one parent,
one teacher, one SLT, one teaching assistant and one
typically developing partner child. The randomisation
will occur at the level of the SLT because once an
SLT has become familiar with E-PLAYS, it is possible
that their approach to children with social communi-
cation difficulties may be influenced. Therefore, SLTs
will receive immediate training if randomised to the
intervention group and if allocated to the control
group, will receive training after all study measures
have been completed.
Participating children in the intervention arm will
receive the E-PLAYS interve ntion while participating
children in the control arm will receive treatment as
usual. The trial will be pragmatic in nature with the
interventions being delivered in the way that they
would be delivered within the NHS. The effectiveness
of E-PLAYS will not be addressed in this feasibility
trial but left to a subsequent full-scale RCT, with the
key outcomes of the present study relating to theMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 3 of 13
feasibility of conducting such an RCT. Assessment of
these feasibility outcomes will inform whether a
full-scale trial is viable and inform its design and
implementation.
Setting
We will recruit SLTs and suitable children on their case-
loads from within North East London NHS Foundation
Trust (NELFT) Speech and Language Services.
Participants
Participants will comprise the following in a ‘participant
group ’comprising one child with social communication
impairment (SCI) with associated relevant others:
(a) SLTs from NELFT
(b) Participating children (ages 4 –7 years old) with SCI
as selected by SLTs ‘focal children ’
(c) Teaching assistants trained to use E-PLAYS by par-
ticipating SLTs
(d) Teachers who will complete pre-, post- and follow-
up test measures relating to participating children
(e) ‘Partner ’children; classmates for the focal children
for the E-PLAYS intervention who will play the
dyadic collaborative computer games that comprise
E-PLAYS with them.
(f) Parents of the focal children who will complete
post-test measures for health economics.
Selection, recruitment and consenting of participants
The procedure for distribution of information sheets
and consent forms for the different kinds of participants
is described below. In all cases, potential participants
will be given at least 48 h in which to make a decision.
(a) SLTs from NELFT
The research team will approach suitably employed
paediatric SLTs, that is SLTs working with children aged 4-
to 7-years-old attending mainstream (not special) schools.
The SLTs will be invited to a presentation by the team, will
have the opportunity to ask questions about the study and
will be given information sheets and consent forms to take
away to read. Consent forms can be returned by post, elec-
tronically or by hand to the research team. SLTs not
responding within a week w ill be reminded and invited
again by email once more only.
(b) Participating children with social communication
impairments (SCI) ‘focal children ’.
SLTs will review their caseloads and identify suitable
children using the Social Communication Behaviour
Checklist devised by Adams et al. [ 40]. The checklistrequires the SLT to decide on the applicability of each of
the following five statements to a given child:
/C15The child has trouble understanding and
interpreting the social context and friendship, e.g.
social roles, emotions
/C15The child has trouble understanding and/or using
non-verbal aspects of communication, e.g. facial ex-
pression, intonation
/C15The child has trouble with aspects of conversation,
e.g. beginning and ending, taking turns, giving
relevant and sufficient information
/C15The child makes bizarre, tangential or inappropriate
comments
/C15The child has difficulty using and understanding
non-literal language
Children who are judged as having at least two of the
five statements applying to them will be considered eli-
gible for inclusion in the study provided they also meet
the following additional criteria:
/C15Four- to seven-years-old at the time of the SLT ’sa s -
sessment of eligibility
/C15Have at least minimum levels of English (including
any children with English as an additional language)
/C15Not suffering with a hearing, visual or physical
impairment severely affecting speech production
Once eligibility is confirmed, the research team will
provide schools with participant information sheets to
send to parents, one written for parents and one written
in simpler terms for the child to share with their parent,
as well as a consent form for parents to sign.
(c) Teaching assistants trained to use E-PLAYS by par-
ticipating SLTs
Once the children with SCI have been selected by SLTs
and consent has been received from parents, the teach-
ing assistants who are supporting these children will be
invited to take part in the study and will receive written
information sheets and consent forms at school from
the research team.
(d) Teachers who will complete pre-, post- and follow-
up test measures relating to participating children
Teachers of recruited children will also be invited to take
part in the study and will receive written information sheets
and consent forms at school from the research team.
(e) ‘Partner children ’for focal children for the E-
PLAYS interventionMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 4 of 13
‘Partner children ’will be suggested by teachers and
teaching assistants in consultation with the relevant SLT.
These children will be typically developing children
without language disorders in the same class as the focal
children. E-PLAYS comprises a series of dyadic com-
puter games, some of which are played with an adult
and some with the partner child. The importance of the
role that peers can play in interventions has been the
subject of a recent systematic review by [ 41]). These au-
thors concluded that the inclusion of peers was one of
the most promising strategies for intervention and re-
sulted in positive impacts on social communication. An
important aspect of peer-mediated interventions con-
cerns the peers chosen to interact with focal children.
These peers can provide appropriate language models
and also an opportunity for children with SCI to practice
newly acquired skills. In general, it has been reported
that teachers children who are popular, prosocial, and
self-confident as peer partners for interventions [ 42].
Locke et al. ’s longitudinal study [ 42] did not report any
adverse outcomes for typically developing children as a
result of participating in a peer-mediated intervention.
An important feasibility question will concern recruit-
ment of these children and willingness of parents to
allow participation. Schools will send participant infor-
mation sheets to parents of the peer partner children,
one written for parents and one written in simpler terms
for the child to share with their parent (as above for
children with social communication impairment), as well
as a consent form for parents to sign.
(f) Parents of the children with SCI who will complete
post-test measures for health economics.
Parents will be asked to consent to completion of
these forms at the same time as they will be asked to
provide consent on behalf of their children (b) above.
Whilst research assistants will pass on information
sheets to participants via schools and request the return
of consent forms, all participants will be given the op-
tion to contact the Chief Investigator in the event of
additional questions. All participants will be free to with-
draw at any time from the protocol treatment without
giving reasons and without affecting their usual standard
of care. The Chief Investigator will preserve the confi-
dentiality of participants taking part in the study and is
registered under the Data Protection Act.
Randomisation and allocation process
Participating children with SCI will be cluster-rando-
mised at the level of the SLTs. SLTs will be randomised
1:1 to receive either immediate briefing from the re-
search team together with the manual on the E-PLAYS
intervention or at to receive this at the end of the trial.Randomisation will take place after SLTs have consented
to participate in the study, and have identified and re-
cruited children on their caseloads to participate in the
trial but before they receive briefing. Allocation will be
via minimisation to ensure balance across the two
groups based on the borough of the SLT (there are five
boroughs within the district covered by NELFT, each
served by a different SLT team) and number of children
recruited (dichotomised around the median number of
children recruited to form a two level factor). All SLTs
will be randomised together as opposed to having a roll-
ing recruitment/randomisation period. The minimisation
will be implemented by the trial statistician at the York
Trials Unit using MinimPy version 0.3. Once the alloca-
tions have been generated, they will be communicated to
members of the research team responsible for training
the SLTs, while ensuring that the outcome assessors (re-
search assistants) remain blind to these allocations.
Blinding
Parent- and teacher-completed measures cannot be
blinded; however, measures collected by research assis-
tants (RAs) will be blinded. Teachers and teaching assis-
tants at the schools will be reminded not to reveal
allocations to the research assistants at every visit. For the
qualitative data collection (Fun Tool Kit, open-ended
training questionnaires, observations and focus groups) in
which blinding is not possible, research assistants will not
collect data from the same schools in which they are col-
lecting quantitative data in order to preserve blinding.
Training
The SLTs in the intervention group will receive training
from the research team and will then, in turn, train
teaching assistants in schools to deliver the E-PLAYS
intervention to the children. Training for SLTs will be
kept to the minimum as the aim of this feasibility study
is to explore the feasibility of implementing E-PLAYS
within the NHS nationally without research team sup-
port. Therefore, SLTs will be introduced to the E-PLAYS
game and to the manual only. The SLTs will use a train-
ing manual with which to train teaching assistants which
covers the delivery of E-PLAYS in depth. They will train
teaching assistants for around 1 h.
Quantitative outcome measures
In addition to basic demographic data on age, gender
and ethnicity, selected quantitative measures have been
chosen for sound psychometric properties (validity, reli-
ability, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability). The
specific feasibility outcomes to ascertain recruitment,
measure treatment fidelity, test acceptability of both the
intervention and of the measures used, and test the feasi-
bility of data collection for language and communicationMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 5 of 13
measures, social and mental health measures, generalisa-
tion and cost effectiveness for an economic evaluation are
given below, with details of the instruments, scales, assess-
ments and interviews to be used:
(a) Recruitment measures
A recruitment log will be kept to determine participa-
tion, drop-out and completion rates to inform a possible
future full-scale trial.
(b) Language and communication outcome measures
(i) The Children ’s Communication Checklist-2,
(CCC-2, [ 43])The CCC-2 is the most widely used, stan-
dardised questionnaire of communication impairment in
research and clinical contexts and will be completed by
teachers.
(ii) Test of Pragmatic Skills, (TPS, [ 44]).This is an
observational elicitation measure. The tester (RA) en-
gages the child in structured play in which test questions
are embedded. The TPS was a sensitive indicator and
successful at detecting improvements in communication
in our pilot study; it has been standardised on 650+ chil-
dren by the author. It will be administered by blinded
RAs.
(iii) Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-5
(CELF-5, [ 45]).We will use one of the subscales; recal-
ling sentences. This sentence repetition assessment is a
frequently used measure and is generally regarded as a
measure of overall language ability drawing upon a wide
range of language processing skills [ 46]. This will also
be administered by blinded RAs.
(c) Social behaviour, friendship and mental health measure
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire The
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is
regarded as the ‘gold standard ’measure and is widely
used as a mental health indicator with subscales asses-
sing behavioural, emotional and peer problems. This will
be completed by teachers [ 47].
(d) Measure of generalisation to social contexts
Dyadic collaborative construction task (Magformers®)
A frequently reported issue with interventions targeting
children with SCI is that the skills learned do not gener-
alise to contexts beyond those of the intervention. In
order to explore whether communication skills learned
through E-PLAYS do in fact generalise to other contexts,
children will be video-recorded undertaking a typical
classroom collaborative task with a peer. The task wewill ask the children to complete involves constructing a
Magformers® model following a set of video-recorded in-
structions; this will take around 10 min. Magformers®
are plastic, brightly coloured, magnetised blocks (similar
in size to Lego® but different in shape and operation)
with which it is possible to construct small models (see
magformers.co.uk ). All children in intervention and con-
trol groups will undertake this task and be recorded;
children ’s use of different kinds of communication will
be observed and coded from the video-recording. The
Magformers® construction task will be facilitated and
video-recorded by blinded RAs who will also undertake
coding of the transcripts from the video-recordings.
(e) Health-economic measures
(i) Bespoke Questionnaire A bespoke questionnaire de-
signed by the team ’s health economist based on previous
work in studies with children will measure the child ’s
health services-use (parent-completed, non-blinded).
(ii) EQ-5D-Y [ 48], PedsQL [ 49]Health utility: both the
parent proxy EQ-5D-Y [ 48] and the parent proxy
PedsQL [ 49] will provide measures of health-related
utility.
For the feasibility study, we will not undertake a full
economic evaluation; we will assess intervention and
trial costs only. We will estimate research and imple-
mentation costs of undertaking a full trial.
Data collection points for outcome measures
Data collection for the TPS, CCC-2, CELF-5 Recalling
Sentences subscale, SDQ and Magformers® construction
task will take place at baseline, 15 –20 weeks and 35 –
40 weeks post-randomisation. These time points are
equivalent to baseline, immediate post-intervention and
3-month follow-up for the intervention group. All health
economic measures will be collected at 35 –40 weeks
post-randomisation (see Fig. 1. SPIRIT figure for
E-PLAYS trial for data collection timings). Data will be
collected at three times points from teachers, parents
and the children themselves. As we are working with
young children who may tire easily, measures will be
collected in two to three short (< 30 min) sessions
when necessary.
Process evaluation
As recommended by the Medical Research Council
(MRC) guidance for RCTs [ 50], we will supplement
quantitative feasibility testing of E-PLAYS with a qualita-
tive process evaluation which will examine the processes
involved in intervention delivery. The processes we will
explore are: whether instructions for delivery of
E-PLAYS are adequate and clear; whether staff in aMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 6 of 13
real-life NHS and school settings can use E-PLAYS faith-
fully; how acceptable staff find E-PLAYS; and whether
children engage with and enjoy E-PLAYS. By conducting
this process evaluation, we hope we may identify any
possible influencing mechanisms or unintended negative
effects not revealed by quantitative measures. In the
event that, for example, we fail to recruit to target, or
that fidelity appears compromised, the process evalu-
ation may be illuminative. The process evaluation that
forms part of this feasibility trial aims to investigate the
following processes linked to implementation:
(a) Speech and language therapists ’and teaching
assistants ’views
Focus groups with the speech and language therapists
and teaching assistants who delivered E-PLAYS will be
conducted once delivery is complete, and their views
sought on acceptability and ease of use.(b) Children ’s views on E-PLAYS
The children ’s view will be solicited using the Fun Toolkit
[51] (which has been designed to measure children ’s views
of technology) by an RA immediately after each of two
sessions.
(c) Fidelity evaluation
(i) On-line recording of the number of intervention
sessions completed for each child and their content
and duration in minutes will be automatically
logged by the E-PLAYS software. For the E-PLAYS
computer game, each child will have their own
unique login, which will record the number of ses-
sions undertaken, the time that they lasted and
which parts of the programme were completed.
(ii) E-PLAYS sessions will be observed live by RAs to
assess how faithfully teaching assistants actually use
it in practice.Fig. 1 SPIRIT figure for E-PLAYS studyMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 7 of 13
(iii)We will also explore fidelity issues in the focus
groups described above.
(d) Training and instructions
Shortly after receiving the instruction pack and manual,
SLTs will be asked to complete a short, open-ended
questionnaire giving their impressions of its utility and
clarity. Teaching assistants will receive a similar ques-
tionnaire after they have received the manual and in-
struction from SLTs (Fig. 2).
Analysis
Recruitment data analysis
The number of children recruited and the rate of attri-
tion will be reported by allocation and in total. The
number of E-PLAYS sessions completed and their dur-
ation will be summarised descriptively for children in
the intervention arm.
Analysis of outcome measures
A detailed analysis plan will be produced prior to the
final analysis and will be reviewed by the independent
trial steering committee. Analyses will follow intention
to treat principles, with all data analysed as rando-
mised. Analyses will be entirely descriptive with scores
on the TPS, CCC-2, CELF-5 Recalling Sentences Sub-
scale and Magformers® construction task presented un-
adjusted at each time point.
For the Magformers® construction task, video-recordings
will be professionally transcribed and video-coding will
comprise observation and categorisation of communicative
(e.g. questions, directives, clarifications) and affective (e.g.
positive and negative behavio urs) items. The coding system
is based on micro-analytic theory [ 52,53] and was devel-
oped by the team specifically to analyse children ’s collab-
orative interaction and has been shown in our studies to
successfully detect changes in talk [ 29,39,54,55]. The cod-
ing system incorporates elements from research into collab-
orative learning, conversation analysis and language
impairment [ 29,39,53–60]. Video interaction will be
coded by blinded RAs trained to fidelity by the Chief
Investigator who has used this coding system exten-
sively. RAs will train by watching and practice-coding
training videos until they rea ch inter-rater reliability
with these previously coded video-recordings. Areas of
disagreement with the training videos will be dis-
cussed and explained by the Chief Investigator.
Inter-rater reliability will further be tested between all
RAs taking part in the study using a sample of 15% of
all video-recordings.
The analysis of all measures will not be concerned
with the effectiveness of the study intervention, but
instead will seek to inform the feasibility objectives.
In particular, this data will be used to characterise thegroups at baseline, assess the proportion of analysable
data at follow up and provide estimates of key popu-
lation parameters, all of wh ich will inform the design
of a future full scale trial. The analysis of the health
economic data will be principally concerned with the
completeness and quality of this data. This will be re-
ported together with a calculated estimate of the
costs of running E-PLAYS within the NHS and
schools and costs of a possible future full-scale RCT.
Process evaluation analysis
(a) Speech and language therapists ’and teaching
assistants ’views
The focus groups (a) will last around 1 h and will be
audio-recorded and subsequently professionally tran-
scribed. Nvivo 9 software will be used to aid a thematic
analysis which will follow the guidelines of Braun and
Clarke [ 61]:
(1) Becoming familiar with the data, (2) generating ini-
tial codes, (3) searching for themes, (4) reviewing themes
and (5) defining and naming themes.
(b) Children ’s views on E-PLAYS
Immediately after participating in sessions, children will
be asked to rate their enjoyment and use of E-PLAYS
using the Fun Toolkit [ 51]. The tool is easy to complete
and requires no writing. It comprises a ‘Smileyometer ’
scale; visual analogue scale with ‘smiley ’faces, ‘Fun
Sorter ’(children sort which attributes of the game they
like best) and ‘Again Again table ’(children rate which as-
pects of the game they would like to play again). The
tool measures, besides user satisfaction, usability (in
software terms) and ease of use. The Fun Toolkit has
shown good test-retest reliability in previous research
[51]. The Smileyometer, Fun Sorter and Again Again
table produce numerical data for scoring; however,
they are also designed to stimulate and encourage
children to talk about the different aspects of the
game and their enjoyment.
(c) Fidelity evaluation
(i) Number of intervention sessions Descriptive statis-
tics will be prepared of the number of intervention ses-
sions completed for each child and their content and
duration. The possible impact of treatment fidelity and
adherence on outcomes will be explored.
(ii) Observations Teaching assistants will be observed
by RAs whilst delivering two sessions each to see how
they actually deliver E-PLAYS in practice. A crucial as-
pect of the intervention is the extent to which the in-
structions in the manual are adhered to. Observers willMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 8 of 13
also record instances of direct verbal feedback and chil-
dren ’s requests for help and comments.
The data from the open-ended questionnaire given to
SLTs and teaching assistants will be analysed by coding
responses into categories known as a ‘coding frame ’[62].
Given that this is a feasibility study and therefore ex-
ploratory in nature, the coding frame will be developed
after the data is collected to cover a range of potential
responses.Sample sizes
(a) Quantitative measures
It is not intended that this feasibility study will be powered
to detect clinical differences between intervention and
treatment as usual groups, this is left for the main trial.
We are proposing to collect data on outcomes that will be
used to inform a future large-scale trial. Sample sizes of
between 24 and 70 have been recommended for feasibility
trials to allow for the reliable estimation of a standardFig. 2 E-PLAYS study flowchartMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 9 of 13
deviation for use in future sample size calculations [ 63,
64]. We therefore aim to recruit 70 children (35 in each
group). We anticipate that attrition will be low; this is usu-
ally the case for school-based studies with young children,
e.g. in our pilot study [ 39], we lost only one child over a
follow-up period of 6 months. However, even with 20%
loss to follow-up, we will retain 56 children, which is more
than double the recommended minimum sample size.
This number will also be sufficient to obtain a reasonably
precise estimate of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient
for the children grouped by SLT.
(b) Qualitative evaluation
All SLTs and teaching assistants in the intervention
group (around seven speech and language therapists and
19 teaching assistants) will receive the open-ended ques-
tionnaire. Ten teaching assistants will be observed live
delivering E-PLAYS and ten children will give their
views using the Fun Toolkit. There will be four focus
groups with four to five speech and language therapists
or teaching assistants in each group.
Discussion
The protocol outlined in this article describes a feasibil-
ity study for a trial to test an intervention ( ‘E-PLAYS ’)
aimed at supporting children with social communica-
tion impairments.
E-PLAYS uses novel computer technology to support
and stimulate children to improve communication whilst
collaborating with their peers. The protocol is based on
our earlier pilot studies [ 29,39], indicating that the
intervention was efficacious when delivered by the re-
search team. Whilst efficacy for E-PLAYS looks promis-
ing, it is important to remember that implementation in
a‘real-world ’context brings with it a number of chal-
lenges not immediately apparent in the closely con-
trolled research setting of a pilot study. Thus, the study
described here aims to investigate a number of import-
ant feasibility questions before proceeding to a full-scale
trial. The context for the implementation of E-PLAYS is
the NHS in the UK. NHS treatment for children with so-
cial communication disorders is the responsibility of
SLTs. SLTs are specialist health professionals and fre-
quently adopt a ‘consultation model ’whereby they pro-
vide training for teaching assistants in schools to deliver
interventions rather than providing intervention directly
themselves [ 65]. Therefore, E-PLAYS will fit well within
typical NHS service delivery if it proves effective when
provided via the consultation model and exploring the
means of evaluating this is the aim of the present study.
The first aim of the feasibility study is to establish
whether sufficient participants can be recruited for a full
trial. Recruitment is complex, involving as it does a
number of the adults concerned with each child. We willaim to determine whether sufficient numbers of SLTs,
children and their parents, teachers and teaching assis-
tants can be recruited and over what period of time for
a definitive large-scale RCT.
The second major potential challenge to implementation
in the NHS concerns fidelity. E -PLAYS is fully manualised,
but is the manual sufficiently clear and comprehensive to
ensure faithful delivery? Unlike in our previous pilot stud-
ies, should E-PLAYS be distributed nationally, it would not
be viable for the research team to train numerous speech
and language teams throughou t the country. A key research
task therefore involves investigating aspects of the indirect
delivery whereby training will b e provided to teaching assis-
t a n t sb yS L T s .T h i sd i f f e r sf u n d a m e n t a l l yf r o md e l i v e r yb ya
trained and supervised RA as in our pilot studies and feed-
back from SLTs and teaching assistants will be crucial.
Other challenges relate more broadly to difficulties
with research concerning children with social communi-
cation impairments. SCI is notoriously difficult to meas-
ure [ 1] as it generally manifests itself only during
dynamic social interaction, thus rendering testing with
standardised questionnaires largely unachievable. A
number of different approaches have been used to ad-
dress this issue [ 1]. One approach is to ask teachers or
another adult who knows the child to rate their pragmatic
language. In this regard, the CCC-2 [ 43] is the most com-
monly used research measure. However, it is possible that
global reports from adults may not be sensitive enough to
detect changes resulting from interventions [ 40]. Further-
more, adult (particularly parent) report for conditions re-
lating to autism and social communication may be
especially susceptible to placebo effects [ 66,67]. Another
approach is to use an elicitation test, that is, to use a series
of structured but naturalistic contexts which are designed
to prompt particular communication behaviours for ob-
servation. The TPS is a well-validated elicitation measure
for the age group targeted by E-PLAYS. Finally, observa-
tion and analysis of children ’s spontaneous interactions
using coding derived from conversation analysis [ 68]
should provide an ecologically valid indication of any
improvement. We will be video-recording children ’s
communications whilst playing with Magformers. The
study will therefore incorporate all three of the ap-
proaches (adult report —CCC-2, TPS —elicitation test
and video-observation) normally used to measure social
communication to minimise the well-documented diffi-
culties with measuring this co nstruct. This is a particu-
lar strength of the study. In addition, the observational
data from the Magformers task will provide a measure
of generalisation, that is, an indication of whether the
skills and strategies learned during the E-PLAYS inter-
vention transfer to other, analogous collaborative con-
texts. Further, more distal measures of generalisation
are included in the form of the SDQ which willMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:75 Page 10 of 13
measure the potential impact of communication
changes on peer relations and classroom behaviour.
Ultimately, there is high potential for E-PLAYS to
make a positive impact on children ’s language learning.
The intervention, being a computer game, can easily be
scaled up and relies on simple technology available in
all schools and NHS trusts . In the long-term, should
the study progress to a full-scale RCT and demonstrate
effectiveness, benefits to children with social communi-
cation impairments could be substantial and could in-
clude enhanced communication, more productive peer
collaboration and improved classroom relations.
