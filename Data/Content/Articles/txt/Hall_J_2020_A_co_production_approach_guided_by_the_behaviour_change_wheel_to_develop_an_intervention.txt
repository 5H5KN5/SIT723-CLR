Abstract
Background: Stroke survivors are highly sedentary; thus, breaking up long uninterrupted bouts of sedentary
behaviour could have substantial health benefit. However, there are no intervention strategies specifically aimed at
reducing sedentary behaviour tailored for stroke survivors. The purpose of this study was to use co-production
approaches to develop an intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour after stroke.
Methods: A series of five co-production workshops with stroke survivors, their caregivers, stroke service staff,
exercise professionals, and researchers were conducted in parallel in two-stroke services (England and Scotland).
Workshop format was informed by the behaviour change wheel (BCW) framework for developing interventions and
incorporated systematic review and empirical evidence. Taking an iterative approach, data from activities and audio
recordings were analysed following each workshop and findings used to inform subsequent workshops, to inform
both the activities of the next workshop and ongoing intervention development.
Findings: Co-production workshop participants ( n= 43) included 17 staff, 14 stroke survivors, six caregivers and six
researchers. The target behaviour for stroke survivors is to increase standing and moving, and the target behaviour
for caregivers and staff is to support and encourage stroke survivors to increase standing and moving. The
developed intervention is primarily based on co-produced solutions to barriers to achieving the target behaviour.
The developed intervention includes 34 behaviour change techniques. The intervention is to be delivered through
stroke services, commencing in the inpatient setting and following through discharge into the community.
Participants reported that taking part in intervention development was a positive experience.

Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study that has combined the use of co-production and the BCW to
develop an intervention for use in stroke care. In-depth reporting of how a co-production approach was combined
with the BCW framework, including the design of bespoke materials for workshop activities, should prove useful to
other researchers and practitioners involved in intervention development in stroke.

Background
Sedentary behaviour is defined as any waking behaviour
in a sitting, reclining or lying posture that is charac-
terised by low energy expenditure [ 1]. High levels of
sedentary behaviour are associated with negative health
outcomes, including cardiovascular disease mortality [ 2].
Breaking sedentary behaviour with regular standing
increases physical function in frail older adults [ 3]. UK
Chief Medical Officer Physical Activity Guidelines rec-
ommend that older adults minimise the amount of time
spent being sedentary and break up long periods of in-
activity with light physical activity when physically pos-
sible or at least standing [ 4]. Stroke survivors are more
sedentary than healthy sex and age-matched controls
(10.9 versus 8.2 h/waking day, respectively [ 5]). Thus, re-
ducing sedentary behaviour has been suggested as a new
target for therapeutic intervention after stroke [ 6].
The Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for
developing and evaluating interventions outlines the im-
portance of systematically utilising evidence and theory
in tandem to develop new interventions [ 7]. In 2016, an
international group of stroke recovery and rehabilitation
experts reported that inadequate theoretical intervention
development may explain the lack of efficacy of many
existing interventions targeting people after stroke [ 8].
The underutilisation of theory to inform intervention
development may be related to the limited guidance
available on how to select theory to suit the context [ 9].
In the context of behavioural theory, the BCW was de-
veloped to address this [ 1]; see Fig. 1.
The capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour
(COM-B) model, which proposes that behaviour is influ-
enced by capability, opportunity, and motivation, forms
the central axis of the BCW. The theoretical domains
framework (TDF [ 10];), consisting of 14 psychological
domains that influence behaviour, can be used alongside
the COM-B model. The COM-B model and TDF can be
used to identify barriers to achieving the desired behav-
iour that an intervention can focus on reducing. The
wider BCW then provides a comprehensive guide to
producing theoretically informed behaviour change
interventions. The BCW framework includes nine
intervention functions, seven policy categories, and 93behaviour change techniques (BCTs) suitable for devel-
oping intervention options and content, following the
behavioural diagnosis. The framework can be applied
across different topics, target groups, and delivery
contexts. There are now several examples of the BCW
framework being applied to develop interventions, for
example, the development of an upper limb exercise
intervention in stroke rehabilitation [ 11] and a work-
place sedentary behaviour reduction intervention [ 12].
Evidence and theory-based intervention development
is only one identified approach to developing complex
interventions [ 13]. A recently published taxonomy
outlines eight categories; see Table 1. Another of the
approaches —partnership —involves active engagement of
stakeholders in developing interventions [ 13]. Taking a
partnership approach can facilitate the development of
feasible and context-sensitive interventions and may
increase the likelihood of developing an intervention that
is efficacious [ 14]. One partnership method is co-
production, a process where service users share degrees
of power to play an active role in producing or develop-
ing goods, services or interventions [ 15]. Co-production
recognises and utilises skills and expertise of various
stakeholders, going beyond developing interventions ‘for’
to developing interventions ‘with ’relevant stakeholders
including service users and providers [ 16]. Taking a co-
production approach can lead to the development of
interventions that focus on changes that are most
important to patients, caregivers and staff [ 17]. This
study took a combination approach, by combining part-
nership with a target population-centred and theory and
evidence-based approach. A combination approach has
potential to add value beyond what can be achieved by
applying either approach independently. The aim of this
study was to use co-production together with the BCW
framework to develop an intervention to reduce seden-
tary behaviour after stroke.
Methods
Background to the study and study design
The work reported herein forms part of a programme of
research (National Institute for Health Research; RP-PG-
0615-20019) to develop and evaluate strategies to reduceHall et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:115 Page 2 of 13
sedentary behaviour after stroke and improve outcomes.
Findings from three workstreams have fed into the
development of an intervention:
/C15Workstream one involved undertaking a series of
systematic reviews to examine views of sedentarybehaviour, effectiveness of interventions and
effective behaviour change techniques for reducing
sedentary behaviour, and the effects of interventions
aimed at breaking up sedentary behaviour on health
outcomes. Findings from this workstream are
reported separately [ 18].

/C15Workstream two comprised a qualitative study
involving non-participant observations in two-stroke
services (inpatient with linked community service),
and interviews with stroke survivors at 6 or 9
months post-stroke, their caregivers (if available)
and stroke service staff, to explore sedentary
behaviours, perceptions of sedentary behaviours, and
participants ’capability, opportunity and motivation
to address them. Findings from this workstream are
reported separately [ 19].
/C15Workstream three reported here, utilised co-
production principles to develop an intervention, in-
corporating evidence generated in workstreams one
and two, and underpinned by the BCW approach to
developing interventions.
The feasibility of the developed prototype intervention
has been tested in three UK stroke services (workstream
four). A subsequent evaluation for clinical and cost-
effectiveness using a multicentre cluster randomised
controlled trial (RCT) in 34 UK stroke services with em-
bedded process evaluation (workstream five) will com-
mence in mid-2020. Ethical approval for this study was
granted by the Yorkshire & The Humber –Leeds East
Research Ethics committee (18/YH/0211) in June 2018.
Co-production principles informing the workshops in-
cluded: (1) a structured, participatory approach where
participants are actively engaged to contribute, (2) a
process to ensure all voices were heard and opinions
evaluated and acted upon and (3) a process to encourage
all participants to contribute to the intervention proto-
type development. All five workshops lasted 2 h and took
place in two UK stroke service settings (West Yorkshire,
Edinburgh). Participants included stroke survivors, their
caregivers, inpatient and community stroke service staff,
and exercise instructors. Throughout the process, the
co-production group members appraised the existing
evidence, reviewed their experiences and views on sed-
entary behaviour after stroke, and in collaboration with
the research team, contributed to the development of
the prototype intervention.
Participants
The intention was to recruit four-to-six stroke survivors
(and their caregivers, if applicable and available) and
four-to-six healthcare professionals, public health profes-
sionals or volunteers from inpatient and community set-
tings, to participate in all five workshops at the site local
to them. Healthcare professionals ’expertise is primarily
based on knowledge of the condition, such as outcome,
treatment, and stroke care pathways [ 20]. For stroke sur-
vivors and caregivers, knowledge is more often related to
the impact and burden of the ongoing impact of stroke
on daily life. In addition, all stakeholders were likely tohave valuable insights into the potential facilitators and
barriers to implementing an intervention to reducing
sedentary behaviour after stroke.
S t r o k es u r v i v o r sw e r ee l i g i b l ei ft h e yh a de x p e r i -
enced a stroke within the last 18 months, had cur-
rently or previously received treatment or care from a
participating stroke service and were able to stand in-
dependently or with the assistance of one person.
Purposive sampling was used to identify participants,
with the aim of including stroke survivors who were
diverse in age, gender and mobility status, and staff
who varied in discipline, seniority and experience in
stroke care, and whether they worked in the inpatient
or community setting. A researcher met with all
participants prior to the first workshop to provide in-
formation about the study, and for them to provide
written informed consent.
Co-production workshop process
Five co-production workshops took place concurrently
at both sites from October 2018 to February 2019.
Workshops were led by one researcher at each site (JH
in West Yorkshire; SM in Edinburgh). At least two other
researchers supported facilitation (DJC, CF, RL, LB). The
workshops in both sites operated independently of each
other, however, they had the same format and content.
The workshop schedule permitted flexibility and
variation in discussions based on the local context. To
ensure consistency between sites, JH and SM attended
all workshops across both sites, with the exception of
workshop one. See Table 2for a summary of the content
of each co-production workshop.
Workshop one was conducted separately for staff, and
for stroke survivors and their caregivers. This was to
introduce the concepts of sedentary behaviour and co-
production in a more comfortable environment, and to
encourage both groups to think about ways of working
collaboratively, on an equal basis, as opposed to a staff
or expert-led approach to patient and public involve-
ment, which may be more familiar to some participants.
In this workshop, participants were actively involved in
co-designing and then utilising (in each subsequent
workshop) progressive activities involving standing and
moving during the workshops. This increased practical
understanding of the simple approaches that could be
used in everyday life as well as engaged the participants
in problem-solving and decision-making, ahead of co-
producing the intervention. Each subsequent workshop
was conducted with both groups and included three
‘elements ’: (1) evidence .and information provision, (2)
utilising knowledge and experience of group members
via bespoke workshop activities informed by the BCW
process, and (3) evaluating the process.Hall et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:115 Page 4 of 13
Strategies for communicating evidence
Key findings from workstream 1 and workstream 2 of
the wider project were fed into the workshops at appro-
priate points to allow the intervention development to
be informed by up-to-date, relevant evidence. Forexample, case studies, referred to during the process as
‘personas ’were developed as a method of communicat-
ing findings from workstream two about the barriers
and facilitators of reducing sedentary behaviour (stroke
survivor personas) and supporting stroke survivors toTable 2 A summary of the content of each co-production workshop and post-workshop activity completed by researchers

reduce sedentary behaviour (staff and caregiver perso-
nas). Infographics were used to communicate findings
from systematic reviews conducted in workstream one,
related to components of effective interventions, in a
user-friendly and engaging format. Examples of these
personas and infographics can be found in Additional
file1. Verbal and written summaries of discussions and
updates on developments since the earlier workshops
were also provided, and often utilised within subsequent
workshop activities. Examples of written summaries of
discussions focused barriers to achieving the stroke sur-
vivor target behaviour are in Additional file 2.
Utilising knowledge and experience of group members
during workshop activities
Workshop activities were informed, to varying degrees,
by BCW worksheets [ 21]. For example, workshop two
activities generated insights for specifying the target be-
haviours and to complete a behavioural diagnosis for
each of the groups. Activities in later workshops focused
on open and creative idea generation. Whilst these activ-
ities were less directly aligned to the BCW the data gen-
erated was applied to the relevant BCW steps, outside of
the workshops (see the analysis section). Although the
BCW was used to inform the workshop tasks and ana-
lyse workshop data, technical language was avoided by
facilitators and in workshop materials, thus, it may not
have been obvious to the participants that the process
was driven by theory. Bespoke materials were developed
for each activity. Selected examples of workshop mate-
rials are provided in Additional file 3.
At each workshop, participants worked in smaller pre-
allocated groups, each with a facilitator. The facilitators
supported the involvement of all participants in discus-
sions, e.g., those with hearing difficulties. Facilitators
utilised topic guides based on evidence from earlier
workstreams during discussions; see Additional file 4.
Smaller groups fed back key discussion points to the
wider group, to share ideas and to foster a sense of
ownership of the developing intervention across all
participants.
Evaluating the process
A range of methods were adopted to evaluate involve-
ment in the workshop process, including questions and
feedback, researcher reflections, a participant group
discussion during the final workshop, and evaluation
forms. Feedback from the evaluation forms was applied
to improve participants ’experience in subsequent
workshops. All participants were given a certificate of
attendance following the final workshop to recognise
their input and achievement.Data collection and analysis
All completed worksheets and forms described in the
“Co-production workshop process ”section, and work-
shop discussions, were utilised as data. Additionally,
each small group discussion was audio-recorded and
transcribed by one of three researchers (JH, SM, JFH).
Data collection, analysis and intervention development
were iterative: following each workshop, data were
analysed and interpreted ahead of the next workshop,
and used to inform both the content of subsequent
workshops and intervention development. Data from
workshops two and three were coded using NVivo 11
by three researchers (JH, SM, JFH) and discrepancies
were discussed with a fourth researcher (RL); a deduct-
ive approach to analysis was taken which involved data
being coded according to pre-defined categories/theor-
ies/techniques as part of the BCW process. Further
detail on how the data from each workshop were
analysed, and how this informed ongoing intervention
development, is included in the ‘post workshop activity ’
column of Table 2.
Results
Participant characteristics and workshop attendance
Forty-three people participated in the co-production
workshops including 17 staff, 14 stroke survivors, six
caregivers, and six researchers (workshop facilitators; JH,
SM, CF, DJC, RL, LB). At least three researchers were
present at each workshop to facilitate the small-group
discussions and activities. See Table 3for an overview of
attendance at each workshop in each location.
At the time of the first workshop, the average age of
the stroke survivor participants was 72 years (range of 56
to 83 years) and the average time since the event of their
stroke was 10 months (range of 4 to 15 months). The
average age of caregivers was 68 years (range of 54 to 83
years). Other stroke survivors and caregiver participant
characteristics are detailed in Table 4. Staff participants
included physiotherapists, therapy assistants, occupa-
tional therapists, registered nurses, healthcare support
workers, exercise instructors and volunteers. Aside from
the exercise instructors, all staff worked at an inpatient
stroke unit or for a linked community stroke service,
and varied in seniority. Ten staff participants had more
than 5 years ’experience in stroke care and the majority
(15) were female.
Feedback on the co-production process
Overall satisfaction with the workshops (1 = not at all
satisfied, and 5 = very satisfied), averaged across work-
shops, sites and participants, was 4.8. Overall satisfaction
with the strategies used to encourage standing and
moving during the workshops was 4.7. The frequency ofHall et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:115 Page 6 of 13
words selected to best represent experience of the work-
shops are illustrated in Table 5.
Positive feedback about participating in the co-
production workshops included feeling that the con-
tributed views, experience and expertise were valued
in the intervention development process, ‘demystify-
ing research ’and gaining an insight into the process-
ing of developing interventions and being given an
opportunity to interact and share experiences with
other people who have had a stroke. Participants
also reported that being part of the process had a
positive influence on their motivation and capability
to (support stroke survivors to) reduce sedentary be-
haviour. Negative feedback included a perception
that workshop participants were all capable of —and
motivated to —reduce sedentary behaviour (stroke
survivors) and support st roke survivors to reduce
sedentary behaviour (caregivers and staff).Intervention development: increasing standing and
moving after stroke
This section describes the process of intervention devel-
opment. The BCW steps are presented sequentially for
clarity however in reality the activities fluid and non-
linear. Co-produced intervention strategies were coded
to the BCTs and intervention functions, rather than
being used to structure the workshop tasks. Figure 2
outlines the key outputs from each co-production work-
shop in relation to intervention development.

and two. Data from workshop two was analysed to
specify the target behaviour and complete behavioural
analyses for the three target behaviours.
Step 1: defining the problem The intervention aims to
address the ‘problem ’of high levels of sedentary behav-
iour in people after stroke. This was defined by the
research team as part of the process of acquiring funding
for the research and was communicated to the partici-
pants involved in the workshops as part of recruitment
for the workshops and reiterated during workshop one.
Step 2: identifying the target behaviour Target behav-
iours were identified for each user group: to increase
standing and moving (stroke survivors), and to support
stroke survivors to increase standing and moving (staff
and caregivers). Whilst the target behaviour was identi-
fied prior to the co-production work, participants ’
preferred terminology was discussed and agreed during
the second co-production workshop. There was a
consensus to avoid the word ‘sedentary ’in the target
behaviours and in intervention materials targeted at
stroke survivors and caregivers due to a perception that
the word is complex, technical, ambiguous and can have
negative connotations, for example, ‘lazy’. Prior to
engaging in the workshops some participants misunder-
stood sedentary behaviour and associated this with a
lack of physical, cognitive or social activity. Participants
agreed that ‘increase standing and moving ’is simple andunderstandable, and reframes the issue in a positive way,
i.e. it is a goal to work towards.
Step 3: specifying the target behaviour During the
second co-production workshop, participants discussed
the target behaviour for each user group of the interven-
tion, including considering where and when the target
behaviour should be performed. Following the workshop
in each location, data from the discussion was coded
and summarised by the research team, to inform the
specification of each target behaviour. As an example,
the stroke survivor target behaviour is aimed at all stroke
survivors admitted to an inpatient stroke unit who are
safe and able to stand either independently or with the
assistance of one person. Stroke survivors should aim to
stand and move at regular intervals throughout the day
however this will be tailored to individual stroke survi-
vors ’capability, safety, and circumstances.
Step 4: identifying what needs to change A‘behav-
ioural diagnosis ’activity was completed during workshop
two, which involved identifying barriers and facilitators
to achieving the target behaviour for two different stroke
survivor, caregiver and staff member ‘personas ’, which
were developed based on the evidence and insight
generated during earlier work streams. Following the
workshop, two researchers coded the data from this
activity into capability, opportunity, motivation and the
TDF domain categories. The behavioural diagnosis facili-
tated the identification of which COM-B and TDFFig. 2 Examples of how data from each workshop contributed to intervention developmentHall et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:115 Page 8 of 13
domains the intervention should target for each user
group, based on the absence or presence of barriers
pertaining to each domain; see Table 6.
As an example, barriers to caregivers achieving the
target behaviour across the COM-B domains included a
limited understanding of how to support stroke survi-
vors to increase standing and moving (capability),
caregivers having other responsibilities which limit the
time they have available to support the stroke survivor
(opportunity), and a perception that there are risks to
supporting the stroke survivor to increase standing and
movement, such as an increased falls risk, that outweigh
the potential benefits (motivation). An example of a
completed behavioural diagnosis is presented in
Additional file 5. The research team developed summar-
ies of the main barriers to achieving the target behaviour
for each user group; see Additional file 2for the stroke
survivor example.
BCW stage 2: intervention options
During workshop three, participants utilised the
summaries of the main barriers to achieving the target
behaviour to identify, and then appraise, ‘solutions ’to
the barriers, including delivery methods. Following the
workshop, the research team reviewed the data and ap-
plied the APEASE criteria to co-produced intervention
components to develop a prototype intervention. All
intervention components were based on solutions and
delivery methods favoured during the workshops and
were ‘coded ’to TDF domains to ensure that the proto-
type intervention addressed the domains identified as
being important to target following the behavioural diag-
nosis (workshop two). During the workshop, fourparticipants appraised the draft intervention components
via a validation activity. Prior to the workshop, the
researchers agreed that any proposed intervention
component that had more ‘no’than ‘yes’responses
across all participants would be removed from the
proposed intervention; no intervention components were
removed as a result of this appraisal activity. The
proposed intervention was iteratively refined based on a
review of workshop four and five qualitative data. The
developed intervention was then retrospectively coded
for intervention functions and policy categories.
Step 5: identify intervention functions The interven-
tion strategies co-produced in workshop three and
refined in workshop four were subsequently coded to
five of the nine intervention functions included within
the BCW [ 21]. The ‘Get Set, Go ’intervention functions
are detailed in Table 7with examples of intervention
strategies that align with the function.
Step 6: identify policy categories The intervention is
intended to be delivered at a service level, and thus
incorporates the policy category ‘guidelines ’as this
involves creating documents that recommend or
mandate practise including all changes to service
provision. None of the other BCW policy categories
were applicable to the developed intervention.
BCW stage 3: content and implementation options
As with the BCW intervention functions and policy
categories (stage two), the co-produced intervention
based on the behavioural diagnosis was retrospectively

coded for behaviour change techniques and delivery
modes.
Step 7: identify behaviour change techniques Follow-
ing the co-production of the intervention compo-
nents, three researchers (JH, SM, JFH) collaboratively
coded BCTs evident within each intervention compo-
nent. For example, caregivers completing an action
planning activity which involves considering chal-
lenges to achieving the target behaviour and how to
overcome them was coded as problem solving. Other
intervention components were further specified to in-
clude additional BCTs, for example, information
about others ’approval (BCT 6.3) was applied to staff
training. The intervention incorporates 34 BCTs from
the behaviour change technique taxonomy v1 [ 22].
The included BCTs were from 11 of the 16 categor-
ies: goals and planning, feedback and monitoring,
social support, shaping knowledge, naturalconsequences, comparison of behaviour, associations,
repetition and substitution, comparison of outcomes,
antecedents, identity and self-belief. No BCTs were
included from the categories: reward and threat, regu-
lation, scheduled consequences and covert learning.

range of categories, including which TDF domains
they target and how they are operationalised in the
intervention.
Step 8: identify mode of delivery Modes of delivery
were initially discussed during workshop three and itera-
tively refined alongside the intervention components
based on data from workshops four and five. Most of
the intervention is delivered face-to-face: some takes
place at a group level (e.g. staff training) whereas other
components are delivered at an individual level. The
intervention also includes written materials, which are
also available online.Table 7 ‘Get Set, Go ’intervention functions

Discussion
This paper reports on an extensive and robust
process to develop a comprehensive intervention
strategy to target sedentary behaviour after stroke.
Intervention studies targeting sedentary behaviour
after stroke to date are few in number and report in-
conclusive findings. Novel in tervention approaches are
urgently needed. Using a combined co-production
and BCW approach, this study has made a substantial
and formative contribution to the literature in the
field. In line with MRC guidance, the intervention
was tested and refined in a feasibility study and will
be evaluated for effectiveness in a multi-site cluster
randomised controlled trial [ 7].
In contrast to some studies reporting challenges in
retaining patients and carers in co-production work
(e.g. [ 23]), this study reported a high retention of
participants across the workshops. The research team
invested time to build trust and positive relationships
with the participants, and sought to foster a sense of
ownership of the intervention development amongst
the participants, by emphasising their expertise and
‘power ’to meaningfully contribute. Feelings of owner-
ship and a perceived ability to contribute are recognised
as important factors influencing engagement in and
success of co-production approaches [ 14]. The partici-
pants in the present study indicated that being part of
the workshop process had been a positive experience.
This is consistent with other co-production and co-
design projects [ 24]. Peer support groups have been
identified by stroke survivors as facilitating adjustment
to life after stroke by, for example, providing an oppor-
tunity to learn from other stroke survivors about coping
with the impacts of stroke [ 25]. Increased peer support
was an unintended but positive outcome of the co-
production work, beyond the primary aim of developing
an intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour after
stroke.
The co-production approach utilised during this
study was guided by the BCW framework for devel-
oping interventions. Utilising the BCW was highly
beneficial as it has resulted in an intervention that
can be described using defined terminology (e.g.
BCTs) which increases intervention replicability and
will inform evaluation [ 21]. The BCW also provided
structure to the co-product ion workshops and related
intervention development. Whilst co-production is
founded on various principles such as greater equality
in the relations between users and professionals [ 26],
there are no set procedures or methods for using a
co-production approach to develop an intervention.
The BCW approach helped to develop ‘milestones ’for
each workshop and ensured defined progress was
achieved following each workshop.Conducting the behavioural diagnosis (stage one of the
BCW) worked particularly well as a group co-
production activity, utilising evidence from earlier work
streams through the ‘personas ’and drawing on the par-
ticipants ’experience and expertise to prioritise the key
barriers and facilitators to achieving the target behav-
iours. However, the behavioural diagnosis resulted in
barriers across almost all domains of COM-B and TDF,
meaning that all intervention functions and policy cat-
egories listed in the BCW framework were potentially
relevant. The behavioural diagnosis is intended to nar-
row down intervention options by focusing on one or
two TDF domains such as knowledge and emotions [ 21],
but the complexity of the behaviours meant that barriers
permeated across all domains. Other researchers who
have developed interventions in a stroke care setting
and/or focused on activity using the BCW framework
have also reported this issue (e.g. [ 11,27]).
There was a degree of tension between stage two and
three of the BCW process and the co-production ap-
proach. It was felt that working directly with interven-
tion functions and BCTs within the workshops might be
restrictive and stunt creativity. To counteract this, a
bottom-up approach to solution generation was under-
taken, based on the behavioural analysis, and the inter-
vention was retrospectively coded into BCW
intervention functions, BCTs, policy categories and de-
livery methods. The authors of the BCW framework rec-
ognise the non-linearity of intervention development
and recommend a flexible application [ 21]. Only one
policy category —guidelines —was selected in the present
study. This was partly due to being limited by the evalu-
ation design for the subsequent cluster RCT; it was not
deemed appropriate to include policy changes that are
delivered wider than service level, as this would risk con-
tamination across the control sites during the RCT.
Additionally, it has been suggested that the inclusion of
policy categories is not essential to an intervention, and
that policy changes might be more appropriately consid-
ered as an intervention function option within the BCW
rather than as a discrete step in the process [ 28].
Co-production approaches and the BCW framework
are both resource-intensive methods. Across all partici-
pants, the workshops consisted of over 250 h of partici-
pant time. Additionally, three researchers (JH, SM, JFH)
spent invested significant time and effort preparing
materials for the workshops and analysing data over a 6-
month period. For example, BCT coding took three staff
26 h each. It is felt that the time and resources invested
have led to the development of a comprehensive inter-
vention that exceeds the needs of the intended users;
however, this investment would not have been possible
without the funding received to develop and test the
intervention.Hall et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:115 Page 11 of 13
Strengths and limitations of this work
We acknowledge some limitations of the intervention
development process. Workshop participants were not
necessarily representative of the general stroke survivor
population that the intervention is designed for. The
participants were a highly motivated group and conse-
quently, the intervention strategies will appear more
acceptable to them. A recognised and common concern
relating to co-production is that such processes may
reinforce inequalities as more educated citizens are more
likely to be receptive to engaging due to perceptions of
their capability to contribute [ 29]. Work is required to
understand how best to engage more disadvantaged in-
dividuals within co-production work. Additionally,
stroke survivor participants were, on average, 10 months
post-stroke at the time of the first workshop, whereas
the intervention will target stroke survivors in the imme-
diate stages post-stroke (in the inpatient setting) and for
12 weeks post-hospital discharge.
A limitation of this paper is that the intervention is
not described in complete detail. There are plans to
evaluate effectiveness in a cluster randomised controlled
trial and therefore to avoid contamination across control
sites, we have avoided disclosing detailed information
about the various components of the intervention. To
date, there is limited evidence about the clinical effect-
iveness of co-produced interventions [ 14,23]. An on-
going, robustly designed study aims to generate evidence
related to measures of co-production processes and their
outcomes through comparative case studies of nine co-
production projects [ 30]. Future research could examine
this further by evaluating co-produced interventions for
effectiveness.
The main strength of this study is the in-depth report-
ing of how a co-production approach was combined
with the BCW framework to develop an intervention.
Our methods and bespoke materials may help other
researchers and intervention developers seeking to
combine co-production and the BCW to intervention
development. Researchers need to publish detailed
reports of how they have combined co-production with
the BCW or other theoretical frameworks, to advance
the field of complex intervention development. Given
the varied benefits that both co-production and the
BCW can offer, it is plausible that combining these
approaches might result in more feasible, acceptable and
ultimately effective interventions than utilising either ap-
proach in isolation. We hope to offer some insight into
this following our planned cluster randomised controlled
trial.
Conclusions
This paper reports on an intervention development
process combining co-production and the BCW. Thestudy found that, although there were challenges, com-
bining co-production and the BCW is feasible and has
multiple benefits including the BCW providing a struc-
ture to the co-production process, and the developed
intervention viewed as being feasible to deliver through
stroke services by participants. This study provides prac-
tical examples of how to use the BCW to guide the co-
production of an intervention, including the design and
utilisation of bespoke materials. The intervention has
been tested and refined in a feasibility study, and will be
evaluated for effectiveness in a multi-site cluster RCT.
