Abstract 
Background Mental wellbeing encompasses life satisfaction, social connectedness, agency and resilience. In ado ‑
lescence, mental wellbeing reduces sexual health risk behaviours, substance use and violence; improves educational 
outcomes; and protects mental health in adulthood. Mental health promotion seeks to improve mental wellbeing 
and can include activities to engage participants in sport. However, few high‑ quality trials of mental health promotion 
interventions have been conducted with adolescents, especially in low‑ and middle ‑income countries. We sought 
to address this gap by testing SMART  (Sports‑based Mental heAlth pRomotion for adolescenTs) in a pilot cluster ‑ran‑
domised controlled trial (cRCT) in Bardiya, Nepal.
Methods The objectives of the trial are to assess the acceptability and feasibility of SMART, test trial procedures, 
explore outcome distributions in intervention and control clusters and calculate the total annual cost of the inter ‑
vention and unit cost per adolescent. The trial design is a parallel‑ group, two ‑arm superiority pilot cRCT with a 1:1 
allocation ratio and two cross‑sectional census surveys with adolescents aged 12–19, one pre ‑intervention (base ‑
line) and one post ‑intervention (endline). The study area is four communities of approximately 1000 population 
(166 adolescents per community). Each community represents one cluster. SMART comprises twice weekly football, 
martial arts and dance coaching, open to all adolescents in the community, led by local sports coaches who have 
received psychosocial training. Sports melas (festivals) and theatre performances will raise community awareness 
about SMART, mental health and the benefits of sport. Adolescents in control clusters will participate in sport as usual. 
In baseline and endline surveys, we will measure mental wellbeing, self‑ esteem, self‑ efficacy, emotion regulation, 
social support, depression, anxiety and functional impairment. Using observation checklists, unstructured observation 
and attendance registers from coaching sessions, and minutes of meetings between coaches and supervisors, we 
will assess intervention fidelity, exposure and reach. In focus group discussions and interviews with coaches, teachers, 
caregivers and adolescents, we will explore intervention acceptability and mechanisms of change. Intervention costs 
will be captured from monthly project accounts, timesheets and discussions with staff members.

Background
Defined as more than the absence of mental health 
problems, mental wellbeing is a positive mental state 
that enables individuals to thrive [1]. Mental wellbe -
ing encompasses life satisfaction, social connectedness, 
agency and resilience and is associated with improved 
physical health including reduced mortality, better 
immune responses and cardiovascular health [1–5]. In 
adolescence, mental wellbeing, especially social connect -
edness and agency, reduces sexual health risk behaviours, 
substance use and violence; improves educational out -
comes; and protects mental health in adulthood [6, 7].
Mental wellbeing is a target for mental health pro -
motion interventions which seek to empower people 
through policies, social and economic interventions and 
programmes that facilitate healthier lives [8]. There is a 
lack of high-quality trials and hence evidence for these 
interventions, especially in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) where around 90% of the world’s ado -
lescents live [9]. Consequently, the 2018 Lancet Commis -
sion for Global Mental Health called for more focus on 
mental health promotion research [10].
The World Health Organization (WHO) and United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Helping Adolescents 
Thrive (HAT) Toolkit outlines possible approaches to 
mental health promotion among adolescents [11, 12]. 
One of these approaches is participation in sport, which 
is promising for three main reasons. First, participation 
in sport during adolescence can reduce depression and 
anxiety symptoms, loneliness and stress [13]. Second, 
sport may promote mental health and wellbeing through 
neurobiological, behavioural and psychosocial mecha -
nisms. The strongest evidence is for psychosocial mecha -
nisms, through improvements in self-efficacy, self-esteem 
and emotion regulation [14, 15]. Third, sport could be an 
equitable platform for intervention because it can engage 
younger and older adolescents, in and out of school, 
across genders and socioeconomic backgrounds.
The evidence base for sports-based mental health pro -
motion is only just emerging [16]. In low- and middle-
income countries, there have been few studies and results 
have been mixed. In Pakistan, an intervention using 
sports and games to build life skills reduced depression 
among 6th and 8th grade public school students (approx. aged 12–14) [17]. In Uganda, an 11-week competitive 
football league increased depression and anxiety-like 
symptoms among boys and there was no effect on girls 
[18]. These findings suggest there are contextual factors 
related to the delivery of sport, the local community and 
the programme setting that influence how sports impact 
mental health and wellbeing. Formative work and pilot -
ing are crucial to understand community barriers and 
facilitators, identify suitable facilitators and venues, 
explore adolescents’ priorities and preferences for inter -
vention and identify how to promote the positive aspects 
of sports.
We sought to fill the evidence gap for sports-based 
mental health promotion in LMICs by developing and 
testing SMART  (Sports-based Mental heAlth pRomo -
tion for adolescenTs) to improve mental wellbeing among 
adolescents aged 12–19 in Nepal. We focus on Nepal 
because adolescents in this setting are exposed to many 
risk factors for mental health problems (e.g. poverty, 
corporal punishment, gender-based violence, effects of 
climate change and earthquakes, inter-caste/ethnicity 
tensions), and beyond family and friends there is limited 
mental health support. SMART involves training local 
sports coaches and assistant coaches in psychosocial 
skills. It was informed by (i) a qualitative study with ado -
lescents, parents, teachers and coaches to identify com -
munity needs, preferences and priorities for adolescent 
mental health promotion and participation in sport; (ii) 
mapping sports for development programmes in Nepal; 
and (iii) a global review of randomised controlled trials of 
sports-based interventions for adolescent mental health 
to consolidate local and global learning on sports-based 
programming. The intervention development process 
and theory of change will be described elsewhere. This 
paper describes the SMART pilot trial protocol.
Aim and objectives
We aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of 
sports-based mental health promotion by coaches and 
trial procedures in a rural Nepali setting. The objectives 
are to:
1. Assess the feasibility and acceptability of SMART 
Page 3 of 11
 Rose‑Clarke et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:149 
 
2. Test trial procedures including cluster randomisa -
tion, blinding, outcome measures and safety standard 
operating procedures
3. Explore outcome distributions in intervention and 
control clusters
4. Calculate the total annual cost of the intervention 
and unit cost per adolescent participant, compared 
with the control, from a provider perspective
Study design and methods
Setting
Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) Nepal 
(www. tpone  pal. org) is leading the study with King’s 
College London (KCL). The study is in Bardiya district, 
in Lumbini Province, on the Indian border. In 2021, the 
estimated district population was 459,900 [19]. More 
than 50% are of Tharu ethnicity, indigenous to this area 
of Nepal, and more than half speak Tharu as their first 
language [20]. Eighty-three percent of men and 72% of 
women aged five and over can read and write [19]. The 
district has one hospital, three primary health centres 
and 30 health posts [21]. The most common sport in 
Bardiya is football but cricket, volleyball and kabbadi  (a 
contact team sport popular across South Asia) are also 
played. Adolescents mostly engage in sport through 
school. Community football clubs exist but are mainly for 
boys. There are few opportunities for girls to play sport in 
the community.
Bardiya is administratively divided into eight munici -
palities. Each municipality is comprised of multiple 
wards. The study area is four communities of approxi -
mately 1000 population, the size of a small ward, in one 
of these municipalities. Each community represents one 
cluster. Communities will be selected on the basis that 
they are far enough apart and/or separated by natural 
boundaries (e.g. jungle or farmland) so that it is unlikely 
adolescents from the control communities will partici -
pate in activities in intervention communities; they are 
accessible to the study team by road; and they are ethni -
cally diverse (and hence findings will be more generalis -
able to other areas of Nepal).
Design
We are doing a parallel-group, two-arm superiority 
pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with 
a 1:1 allocation ratio and two cross-sectional surveys, 
one pre-intervention (baseline) and one post-interven -
tion (endline). Trials using this design have been used 
to evaluate community-based interventions including 
women’s groups in Nepal, India and Bangladesh [22–24] 
and adolescent groups in India [25]. In a fully powered 
trial using this design, the primary analysis would be a cross-sectional comparison across trial arms of outcomes 
from the endline survey, adjusted for baseline differences. 
However, because our trial is an underpowered pilot trial, 
we will not be testing between-group differences.
We chose this trial design because a cross-sectional 
comparison of trial arms rather than a longitudi -
nal approach is advantageous. Adolescents are highly 
mobile and we anticipate a substantial proportion will 
move in or out of the study clusters for employment, 
marriage, or education and we would not be able to fol -
low them up. We chose a design which enables us to 
examine the effects of the intervention at the commu -
nity level because (i) emerging evidence emphasises the 
importance of community social cohesion in protecting 
adolescent mental health [26] and the newly published 
WHO-UNICEF HAT guidelines recommend commu -
nity-based universal approaches to adolescent mental 
health promotion [12]; (ii) there are likely to be benefits 
of a sports-based intervention that extend beyond the 
participants themselves to their supporters and peer 
network, including enhanced social interaction and con -
nectedness; and (iii) an open intervention model is more 
inclusive and therefore ethical, and in line with existing 
community sports programmes in this setting.
Trial participants and target population
For the baseline and endline surveys, we aim to recruit all 
eligible adolescents aged 12 to 19 living in the four study 
clusters. Although the WHO defines adolescence as the 
age range from 10 to 19 [27], we will not include adoles -
cents aged 10 and 11 because findings from our formative 
qualitative research suggest adolescents attending sec -
ondary school (aged 12 to 19) do not want to participate 
in sports coaching with those attending primary school. 
We will exclude adolescents who do not permanently 
reside in the study clusters (i.e. adolescents who live 
outside the clusters but are visiting friends/family in the 
study area at the time of the survey). Intervention activi -
ties are open to any adolescents aged 12–19 who wish to 
participate, but the target population will be those living 
in the two intervention study clusters.
SMART intervention
Figure  1 provides an overview of the intervention which 
aims to improve adolescent mental wellbeing through 
sports coaching with integrated psychosocial skills train -
ing. In each intervention cluster, we will offer coach -
ing in football, dance and martial arts. We chose these 
sports because adolescents participating in our formative 
research said they were interested to receive coaching in 
these sports and because the coaches were available in 
Bardiya.
Page 4 of 11 Rose‑Clarke et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:149 
Adolescents can participate in one or more sports at 
the same time, attending as many or as few coaching 
sessions as they wish. Coaching for each sport will be 
implemented in parallel over 10 months. Coaching ses -
sions will be 90 min and held twice per week on school 
premises or community sports grounds. Each session 
will include training on sports and psychosocial skills 
including interpersonal communication, self-aware -
ness, assertiveness, coping and problem-solving. Ado -
lescents will work on these skills through drills, games, 
role-play, discussions and relaxation exercises. They 
will be encouraged to apply the skills outside coaching 
sessions, in school and at home.
For each sport, sessions will be led by a locally 
recruited sports coach and an assistant coach. Coaches 
will be recruited through open advertisement and per -
sonal networks. Eligibility criteria include experience 
coaching in martial arts, dance or football and the 
ability to live in the study area for the duration of the 
intervention. Coaches will receive an 11-day training 
programme led by psychosocial counsellors covering 
concepts of adolescent mental health, orientation to 
SMART and the role of a SMART coach, foundational 
helping skills (empathy, verbal and non-verbal com -
munication, listening, etc.), group facilitation skills, 
safeguarding, self-care and basic first aid. Coaches will 
practice sessions with small groups of adolescents and 
receive feedback from counsellors.Through our formative research, we learned about 
some of the barriers to adolescents playing sport, espe -
cially among girls. These include girls feeling uncomforta -
ble playing with boys and a male coach, feeling vulnerable 
and at risk of sexual assault and lack of knowledge about 
the rules of the sport. We will try to address these barri -
ers in the intervention by (i) recruiting a female coach or 
assistant coach for each sport, (ii) running some sessions 
on school sports grounds where girls feel safe and do not 
have to travel far from their homes and (iii) assuming no 
previous knowledge or experience of the rules and pro -
viding an orientation in coaching sessions.
Coaches will organise sports melas (festivals) at the 
start, midway and at the end of the 10-month implemen -
tation period. Melas will involve contributions from foot -
ball, martial arts and dance, including football matches, 
martial arts demonstrations and dance performances, 
and will serve as a platform for adolescents to try out 
different sports and engage with their community about 
adolescent mental health and the benefits of sports for 
mental wellbeing. Sports coaches and assistant coaches 
will meet with existing community groups (mothers’ 
groups, micro-credit groups, parent/teacher commit -
tee) to explain the intervention and its potential benefits 
for adolescents. Coaches will support individual adoles -
cents to attend coaching sessions, for example, by meet -
ing with adolescents and their parents. We will also work 
with a theatre group to create short, community dramas Fig. 1 Overview of the SMART intervention

 Rose‑Clarke et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:149 
 
to promote adolescent mental health and participation 
in the intervention. A detailed description of the inter -
vention theory of change is the focus of a forthcoming 
publication.
Control: enhanced usual care
We will distribute sports equipment (e.g. footballs, nets, 
kit) at the municipality level and adolescents in control 
clusters will be free to participate in sports as usual.
Most people with mental health problems in Bardiya 
do not receive psychological or psychiatric intervention 
due to the lack of local mental health services. We will 
conduct training for health workers in the municipal -
ity based on the WHO mental health Gap Action Pro -
gramme Humanitarian Intervention Guide which has 
been contextualised for Nepal [28]. In both control and 
intervention clusters, we will provide information about 
how to access these trained health workers. Adolescents 
identified as being at high risk of suicide will be referred 
to a psychosocial counsellor employed through the 
project.
Recruitment
Trained researchers will recruit participants for the 
cross-sectional surveys by going house to house in all 
four study clusters, asking members of each household if 
there are any adolescents living there.
To recruit participants for the intervention activities, 
we will publicise information about coaching through 
schools, community theatre performances and at sports 
melas in the intervention clusters.
Outcomes and tools
To assess the primary outcome, mental wellbeing, we 
will use the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale 
[29]. For secondary outcomes, we will use the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [30], Schwarzer Self-Efficacy Scale 
[31], Adolescent Emotion Regulation Strategies Ques -
tionnaire [32] and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived 
Social Support [33] to measure self-esteem, self-efficacy, 
emotion regulation and social support respectively. Tools 
to measure primary and secondary outcomes have been 
translated and adapted for Nepal and will be validated 
using data from the trial baseline survey. We will also 
measure depression using the Patient Health Question -
naire 9 items—modified for adolescents (PHQ-A) and 
the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) 
to measure anxiety [34, 35]. Functional impairment will 
be assessed using a tool developed by the research team 
which asks about 11 locally relevant, age-appropriate 
daily activities (e.g. working in the fields, doing household 
chores and doing homework) and, in the past 2  weeks, 
if there was any difficulty completing them. Response 
options are 0 “None of the time” , 1 “ A little of the time” , 
2 “Some of the time” and 3 “Most of the time” . Higher 
scores indicate more functional impairment. Measures 
are described in Table 1.
Randomisation
An independent researcher who is not familiar with the 
study setting will randomise clusters before the baseline 
survey. Clusters will be paired and one cluster in each 
pair will be randomised to the intervention arm and one 
to control. One pair will be semi-urban clusters near the 
main highway. The other pair will be rural clusters far 
from the road and relatively inaccessible. The researcher 
will use SPSS software to do the randomisation.
Blinding and concealment
The research and intervention teams will work inde -
pendently from separate offices. Researchers conduct -
ing the baseline and endline surveys will not be given

information about the allocation of clusters but may 
encounter some of the intervention activities and par -
ticipants. Due to the participatory nature of the inter -
vention, adolescents, sports coaches and assistant 
coaches will not be blind to allocation. The researcher 
conducting the final pilot trial analysis will be blind to 
allocation.
Sample size
The decision to include four clusters was informed by the 
available budget and resources. Four clusters will enable 
us to pilot intervention implementation in two sites and 
test the randomisation technique. In Nepal, 11.2% of ado -
lescents are aged 15–19; 10.4% are 10–14 [36]. Around 
6.2% will therefore be aged 12–14. In each cluster of 
c.1000 population, we expect there will be around 166 
adolescents aged 12–19—i.e. 17.4% of the population. In 
total, in the four clusters, we expect there to be 696 ado -
lescents. Some adolescents will be living away from home 
for work or study. Assuming 20% are living away, we will 
sample 556 adolescents. Although we will estimate the 
intra-cluster correlation coefficient and recruitment rate 
using the baseline data, these will be biased downwards 
due to the small number of clusters [37]. In calculating 
the sample size for a future full-scale cRCT, we will tri -
angulate our estimates with those from the wider litera -
ture including other studies in Nepal and trials of mental 
health promotion interventions to ensure the trial is fully 
powered.
Data collection, management and monitoring
Researchers will find a convenient time to conduct 
the interview with the adolescent in their home or 
another private, convenient place. If an adolescent is 
not available when the researcher visits, the reason will 
be recorded. The researcher will try up to three times 
to conduct the interview. In interviews, we will col -
lect data on adolescent mental health and wellbeing, 
household socioeconomic status, sports preferences 
and participation in the intervention activities. The sur -
vey will take around one hour to complete. We will use 
the KoboToolbox data collection platform. Researchers 
will enter data on mobile phones or tablets. We will use 
automated skip patterns and consistency logic to reduce 
errors and missing data.
During the surveys, the project coordinator will regu -
larly download data from the server to check the number 
of interviews completed and identify any problems such 
as outliers, errors or missing data. We will pseudonymise 
the final dataset and store it on TPO Nepal’s secure cen -
tral server and KCL Sharepoint.Process evaluation
We will explore how the intervention is implemented, 
mechanisms through which it may bring about change, 
and contextual factors that might affect outcomes and 
implementation. In intervention clusters, we will collect 
data on intervention fidelity; exposure and reach using 
observation checklists; unstructured observation of 
coaching sessions; minutes of meetings between coaches, 
assistant coaches and the intervention supervisors; and 
attendance registers from coaching sessions. We will also 
conduct focus group discussions and interviews with 
key stakeholders (i.e. coaches, teachers, caregivers and 
adolescents) at the end of the intervention. Table  2 lists 
the process evaluation data collection methods. We will 
analyse quantitative data from the baseline and endline 
survey. Interviews and focus groups will last around one 
hour. Adolescents will be recruited at intervention activi -
ties (intervention participants) or in schools (non-partic -
ipants). Caregivers will be recruited through coaches and 
teachers. Key stakeholders will be approached directly by 
the research team.
Adolescents will be purposively sampled based on their 
gender, age and participation (or not) in the interven -
tion. Caregivers will be purposively sampled based on 
the gender and age of their child—we would like a mix of 
genders and ages of adolescents. Teachers will be purpo -
sively sampled as the key point person in the school for 
the intervention. All sports coaches and assistant coaches 
will be sampled. Sampling will also be informed by any 
differences that we observe whilst implementing the 
intervention.
In addition to the process evaluation, we will meet with 
three community advisory groups of (i) adolescents, (ii) 
caregivers and (iii) teachers and health workers who are 
living or working in the intervention clusters. We will 
ask the groups for their perspectives on the interven -
tion, including any unexpected harms or benefits. Infor -
mation from these meetings will inform the content of 
ongoing training and supervision of the coaches, logistics 
and adolescent recruitment strategies and contribute to 
the process evaluation. Each group will have six to eight 
members, recruited from the intervention clusters, repre -
senting local diversity in terms of caste/ethnic group and 
gender. We will sample younger and older adolescents 
and the caregivers of younger and older adolescents. 
Groups will meet twice: after the first 14-week block of 
sessions and mela, and at the end of the intervention.
Participant incentives
We will cover transportation costs incurred by adoles -
cents and adults participating in the process evalua -
tion and community advisory groups. They will also be 
Page 7 of 11
 Rose‑Clarke et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:149 
 
offered refreshments (juice and biscuits). No incentives 
will be offered to adolescents participating in the baseline 
or endline survey, or coaching sessions.
Post‑trial care
Where required, a psychosocial counsellor employed by 
TPO Nepal will remain in the study setting to provide 
follow-up care for study participants.
Ethics and research governance
The trial has ethical approval from King’s College Lon -
don (RESCM-22/23–27,152; HR/DP-22/23–33,427) and 
the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) Ethics Com -
mittees (Ref no. 3088).
The NHRC requires caregiver consent and adolescent 
assent for adolescents under the age of 18, which we will 
adhere to in this study. We will collect consent for par -
ticipation in the baseline survey and again for the endline 
survey. A trained researcher will explain the study to the 
adolescent and caregiver and give them a consent/assent 
form and information sheet (in Nepali). The researcher 
will ask the adolescent and caregiver if they have any 
questions about the study and make sure they are satis -
fied before asking them both to sign the consent/assent 
form. We will stress that just because the adolescent par -
ticipated in the baseline survey and/or the intervention activities they are not obliged to participate in the endline 
survey. We will also ask for consent/assent from adoles -
cents participating in the coaching sessions and consent 
from their caregiver where necessary. Sports coaches will 
collect the signed consent/assent forms at the start of the 
sessions. For the process evaluation and community advi -
sory groups, participants (adults and adolescents) inter -
ested in participating will be given a consent/assent form 
and information sheet. Participants (and caregivers) will 
be able to ask researchers any questions about the study 
either in person or by phone (contact details on the infor -
mation sheet). Those who return signed consent/assent 
forms will be able to participate.
Harms
There is no data safety monitoring committee for this 
trial: adverse events and severe adverse events will be 
reported to an independent trial steering committee. 
Participant information sheets will outline the research 
topic (mental health promotion) and, where applicable, 
participants will be asked about mental health problems. 
Researchers will be trained to ask questions in a sensitive 
and culturally respectful way and to conduct interviews/
focus group discussions in a private space where par -
ticipants feel comfortable. Participants will be reminded 
that they can stop or pause if they are uncomfortable Table 2 Process evaluation data collection

and that they do not have to answer questions if for any  
reason they do not want to. If participants do become 
visibly distressed, researchers will ask if they would like 
to take a break or finish and will follow up with them 
individually. If participants disclose suicidal behav -
iour, the researcher will activate a standard operating  
procedure which involves arranging an urgent assess -
ment by the TPO Nepal psychosocial counsellor who is 
based in the study area. Cases will be documented and 
submitted to the project coordinator and principal inves -
tigators for review.

tion. The psychosocial counsellor will assess these cases 
and formulate a plan which may involve local health ser -
vices and services for survivors’ support.
If adolescents incur an injury due to the intervention 
(e.g. during the sports coaching), coaches and/or assis -
tant coaches will assess the severity, consult with the 
adolescent and their caregiver and help them to access 
appropriate health facilities if necessary. Coaches will 
have access to a basic first aid kit.
Planned analyses
Qualitative data
Audio recordings of qualitative interviews and focus 
group discussions will be transcribed in Nepali or 
Tharu and translated into English. We will analyse Eng -
lish transcripts along with observation notes using the 
Framework Method [38]. We will develop an analyti -
cal framework informed by the intervention theory of 
change and including deductive codes related to feasi -
bility and acceptability. Several members of the research 
team will be involved in coding transcripts. All coders 
will initially code the same three transcripts and compare 
coding to check consistency.
We will take notes during meetings with community 
advisory groups which will inform the ongoing interven -
tion process and process evaluation tools.
Quantitative data
JH, NPL, KRC and DR will have access to the final trial 
dataset. JH will conduct the main analyses. Quantitative 
outcomes will be descriptively summarised (mean and 
standard deviation for continuous data or counts and 
proportions for categorical) for each trial arm at base -
line and endline. We will obtain preliminary estimates of 
differences in primary and secondary outcomes by trial 
arm at the cluster level. By linking baseline and endline 
data at an individual level, we will explore differences for 
adolescents who participated in intervention activities on an intention to treat and per protocol basis. Although the 
number of clusters is small, the anticipated sample size 
per cluster should be sufficient to assess factors predic -
tive of participant attrition and adherence (for example 
due to person mobility) [39]. Individual outcomes  (and 
in a full trial—cluster-level outcomes) can be evaluated  
taking into account pre-intervention and post-intervention 
predictors of missingness and adherence using recent 
developments leveraging machine learning in causal  
estimators such as targeted maximum likelihood estima -
tion [40].
Cost analysis
We will calculate the costs of setting up and implement -
ing the intervention, compared with the control, from 
the provider perspective. Costs from monthly project 
accounts will be entered into an Excel costing tool, cate -
gorised as start-up or implementation costs and allocated 
to different cost centres (capital, staff and materials) 
and activities such as sports coaching or monitoring 
and evaluation. Costs related to research activities will 
be captured but excluded from the results. Project staff  
timesheets will inform how much of staff salaries should 
be allocated to set-up and implementation and across 
different activities. Staff will be asked about their time 
allocations at the end of manual development, ahead of 
implementation and at the end of implementation. Both 
financial and economic costs will be calculated. Indirect 
costs that are not captured by project accounts such as 
the opportunity cost of volunteer time or donated goods 
will be identified through project records and discussions 
with staff members and then assigned a value using local 
secondary data or assumptions. Results will include the 
total annual cost of SMART compared with the control, 
annual implementation costs, unit cost per adolescent 
and cost per cluster. One and two-way sensitivity analy -
ses will be carried out by varying key inputs with uncer -
tainty such as joint costs and staff time allocations.
Mixed methods framework
Overall, we will use a fully mixed concurrent equal status 
mixed methods design that mixes qualitative and quan -
titative research across the research objectives, type of 
data and data inference [41]. In the process evaluation, 
quantitative findings relating to reach and fidelity will 
be explored through qualitative research, using a fully 
mixed sequential equal status design. We will use the 
Good Reporting of A Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS) 
Framework to inform and describe the collection, analy -
sis, integration and interpretation of quantitative and 
qualitative data [42].

Progression criteria
Related to the study objectives, we have identified criteria 
to inform the decision to progress to a fully powered cRCT:
• Fidelity to the intervention manual—at least 75% of 
activities in each session completed at a satisfactory/
superior level according to a fidelity checklist devel -
oped for the intervention.
• Exposure to the intervention—at least 30% of adoles -
cents aged 12–19 living in the intervention clusters 
participate in at least five coaching sessions, measured 
in the endline survey. This is based on our assump -
tion that 30% of adolescents need to participate to see 
effects at the community level and five sessions are suf -
ficient for adolescents to build their psychosocial skills.
• Fewer than 10% of adolescents experience an adverse 
event (i.e. an untoward physical or psychological 
occurrence which is potentially related to the inter -
vention) or a severe adverse event (i.e. an adverse 
event that is life-threatening, results in death and/or 
requires hospitalisation).
• Fewer than 15% missing items on mental health and 
wellbeing outcome measures at endline
• Fewer than 10% of adolescents living in the control 
clusters participated in the intervention.
Where criteria are not met, we will revisit the inter -
vention/trial procedure in depth before progressing to 
a full trial.Dissemination
We will publish findings from the trial in academic jour -
nals. We will organise dissemination events in Bardiya 
and Kathmandu, with national and local government offi -
cials, adolescents, caregivers, teachers, researchers and 
non-governmental organisations.
Timeline
Recruitment and data collection for the baseline sur -
vey and facilitator training started in Jan 2023. Table  3 
presents the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recom -
mendations for Interventional Trials) enrolment, inter -
ventions and assessment schedule.
Discussion
We have developed a community sports intervention 
for adolescents in Nepal, which will help to address the 
scarcity of evidence-based mental health promotion 
interventions for children and adolescents in LMICs. 
Strengths of our study design include (i) an intervention 
informed by evidence at the local and global level work -
ing with locally available resources and personnel; (ii) a 
relatively long intervention period to maximise any bene -
fits; (iii) a pragmatic cross-sectional evaluation approach 
to account for the mobility of adolescents, and to explore 
any effects of sport for those not directly participating 
in the intervention activities; and (iv) community advi -
sory groups and a process evaluation to provide insight 
into how the intervention is being implemented and may

effect change. Limitations of the study include the lack 
of blinding among coaches, assistant coaches, teachers 
and intervention supervisors, and the small number of 
clusters and potential baseline differences between con -
trol and intervention arms. Findings from the study will 
inform the decision to progress to a fully powered clus -
ter-randomised controlled trial. Where findings point to 
feasibility and acceptability issues, for example in terms 
of randomisation, fidelity to the intervention manual, and 
safety procedures, these will be addressed and modified 
in the full trial protocol.
Trial status
The trial is open and recruiting participants for the base -
line survey. Any amendments to this protocol will be 
communicated to the Research Ethics Committees and
