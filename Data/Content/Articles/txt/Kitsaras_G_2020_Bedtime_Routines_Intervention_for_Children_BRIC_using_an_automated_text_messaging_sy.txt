Bedtime Routines Intervention for Children
(BRIC) using an automated text messaging
system for behaviour change: study
protocol for an early phase study

Abstract
Background: This work concerns the activities in the last hour before bed for young children born to first-time
parents, so called bedtime routines (BTR). These activities include amongst others tooth brushing, reading a book,
having a bath and avoiding food and drinks before bed. Having a set bedtime at a suitable hour is also very
important. Establishing good bedtime routines has been shown to be really important for a number of health,
wellbeing, development and social outcomes. Currently, there is no evidence-based bedtime routine intervention
for first-time parents using a novel design (i.e. text messages). Existing research has highlighted the importance of
bedtime routines and the lack of appropriate mechanisms in place for parents who sought support.
Methods: The proposed study includes 2 work packages. Work package 1 focuses on the development of the
intervention through a combination of qualitative work (1:1 interviews with parents on barriers and facilitators on
bedtime routines using the Theoretical Domains Framework) and an expert group of key stakeholders. Work
package 2 involves a small-scale ( n= 50) feasibility and effectiveness study to examine proof of concept with first-
time parents using text messages to communicate the intervention. Quantitative information relating to uptake,
engagement, retention and effectiveness of the intervention as well as qualitative information (focus groups with
parents who took part in the study) will be collected. Overall, the effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed
through the APEASE criteria (acceptability, practicability, effectiveness, affordability, safety, equity).
Discussion: This study can provide initial yet important support for further exploration in the field of bedtime
routines in more complicated family structures (parents with more than 1 child, separated families etc.). Also, the
implementation of a novel study design (i.e. text messages) could lead to considerable cost savings while
maintaining high retention, uptake and engagement from the participants. Should the intervention meet the
APEASE criteria, a more comprehensive intervention on bedtime routines for first-time parents will be explored in a
more robust (RCT and longitudinal) approach.
Trials registration: Due to the nature of the study, no trial registration is currently in place.

Background
Bedtime routines are the single most frequent and recur-
rent activity for families with young children [ 1,2]. Bed-
time routines are established gradually around the first
year of a new-born ’s life, and by the end of infancy (year
2), most families have well-established routines [ 1]. During
bedtime routines, a series of repeated behaviours (i.e.
tooth brushing, book reading, going to bed at a consistent
time, dietary habits/avoiding sugary snacks etc.) take place.
These behaviours can have implications for oral hygiene
and dental health [ 3], quality of sleep [ 4], school perform-
ance and school readiness [ 5], psychosocial development
[6], and behavioural and cognitive development [ 6]a sw e l l
as parental socioemotional wellbeing [ 6] and overall family
functioning [ 1–6]. Bedtime routines therefore are not just
relevant to a single public health issue. They cover a com-
bination of health, developmental, social and behaviours
with short- and long-term implications for young children,
their parents, public finances and the health service. An
intervention targeting first-time parents of young children
is especially important given the crucial link between early
life experiences, later achievement and wellbeing for chil-
dren as well as the importance of assisting and supporting
young parents highlighted by other publicly funded pro-
jects like baby boxes, Dental Checks by 1 and Head Start
in the USA [ 1,5,7]. These interventions apart from their
focus on children provided parents, as the primary care-
takers for young children, with important skills, training,
information and education resources to allow for greater
effectiveness [ 6].
The lack of good oral hygiene behaviours around bed-
time and consumption of snacks/drinks in the hour before
bed increases the likelihood of dental caries [ 7]. The nega-
tive impact of dental caries in young children includes
chewing difficulties, sleeping difficulties, changes in behav-
iour (e.g. irritability), adverse psychological development
(such as low self-esteem) and loss of school days with im-
pact on school performance [ 8,9]. Also, if left untreated,
dental caries can lead to extractions under general anaes-
thetic with further implications for children ’sp s y c h o s o c i a l
wellbeing with increased pain, need for hospitalisation, in-
creased anxiety for parents as well as public finances and
public healthcare pressures [ 9]. In just one financial year,
the NHS has spent almost £60 million on preventable
tooth extractions in young children [ 10], and it is the com-
monest reason for children to be admitted to hospital. In
general, dietary habits around bedtime have shown im-
portant associations with obesity rates with snacking be-
fore bed linked to higher BMI, while those with significant
dental decay are often undernourished [ 11]. Book reading
with children as part of the bedtime routine can promote
child literacy, improve school performance and enhance
school readiness in young children with subsequent pos-
sible implications in later achievement and attainment[12]. School readiness at age five is considered key for suc-
cessful grades at school, reducing high school dropout and
higher earnings in adulthood [ 13]. Finally, having a con-
sistent, appropriate time children go to bed could aid in
achieving adequate hours of sleep with important conse-
quences for psychological wellbeing, physical health, fam-
ily functioning, school achievement and optimal brain
development [ 4].
Despite growing evidence on their importance, bedtime
routines remain underresearched [ 5]. Existing attempts in
changing bedtime routines in families with young children
have either utilised non-automa ted, resource intensive ap-
proaches [ 12] or focused on selective bedtime routines be-
haviours rather than the entirety of the routine and its
different components [ 6] .D e s p i t es o m es h o r t c o m i n g ,e x i s t -
ing interventions have showcased the potential of changing
and maintaining optimal behaviours around bedtime
routine-related activities. For e xample, an intervention on lit-
eracy skills development linked to book reading before bed
showed increased and sustained changes for those targeted
behaviours (book reading/book sharing before bed) for the
intervention group when compared to the control [ 12].
Nevertheless, issues with past studies and existing inter-
ventions create a unique opportunity for developing a
novel, automated, text message-based intervention that
addresses all aspects of bedtime routines for first-time par-
ents. Despite preliminary work from this research team,
an early phase study is important for gaining a better un-
derstanding of bedtime routines in first-time parents, an
understanding that will allow for the development of an
evidence-based intervention. This research team has com-
pleted one of the few bedtime routine-related studies in
the UK with families with young children with promising
results regarding the importance of bedtime routines and
the incorporation of text message-based applications for
families with young children [ 14,15]. However, the cre-
ation of such a novel intervention requires preliminary
technical development and testing that can be achieved
through an early stage study. In effect, the proposed early
phase study will act as a bridge between existing evidence
on bedtime routines and the transformation of that know-
ledge into a practical, evidence-based intervention that
can help first-time parents.
Text messages will be at the heart of the proposed inter-
vention. Text messages are going to be used given the high
percentage of people who own a working mobile device
(93% in the UK) [ 16], the successful use of text message in-
terventions targeting other health-related behaviours [ 17],
their popularity as a means of communication in general
and amongst ethnic minorities and deprived communities
as well as their overall low cost per participant [ 17,18].
Moreover, text messages as an observational data collection
tool were successfully utilised by this research team in a
study of bedtime routines with families with young childrenKitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:14 Page 2 of 9
with extremely positive feedback on the lack of intrusive-
ness, ease of use and interface [ 15]. Finally, avoidance of
app-based or computer-based systems or approaches is
considered beneficial in re ducing harm through limited
screen time exposure for parents.
Objective
The objective of this public health early phase study is
to develop and test an intervention to support the adop-
tion and maintenance of optimal bed time routines for
first time parents that will lead to measurable improve-
ments in health, development and wellbeing for young
children. The intervention will utilise real-time, respon-
sive text messages that are co-designed and developed
with parents and experts. Proof of concept will be
assessed through the APEASE criteria following a feasi-
bility and effectiveness study.
Methods/design
Study design overview
The early phase study will include 2 work packages
(WP) over an 18-month period. User and stakeholder
engagement will be in the core of each WP. Figure 1
presents an overview of the study and its individual
working packages.
WP 1 (months 1 –9) will focus on defining and develop-
ing the intervention. WP 1 will consist of 3 sub-packages:
(WP 1.1) will identity barriers a nd facilitators for establish-
ing and maintaining good bedtime routines; (WP 1.2) will
include an expert group of key stakeholders, academics and
researchers; and finally (WP 1 .3) will involve the technical
development of the system used to deliver the intervention.
WP 2 (months 10 –18) will include an uncontrolled quanti-
tative and qualitative feasib ility and effectiveness study
using the text message-based be dtime routine intervention.
Eligibility
For WP 1.1 (qualitative work) and WP 2 (feasibility and
effectiveness study), only first-time parents with young
children (between 1 –3 years old) will be considered for
the study. Both parents will need to be first-time parents.
Single parent families will be included as well as parents
from academic/non-academic backgrounds. No age re-
strictions apply to participants. Exclusion criteria will in-
clude inability to comprehend English, no access to
working mobile phone and not being a first-time parent.
Participants
For WP 1.1 (qualitative work), it is expected that a total
of 20 first-time parents will take place. Data saturation
will be monitored throughout data collection, and once
saturation has been achieved, data collection will stop.
Data saturation estimates as based on previous work by
the research team on bedtime routines barriers andfacilitators for parents. The sample in WP 2 will consist
of 50 first-time parents with young children. For the
focus groups, at the end of WP 2, it is expected that at
least 50% of participants who received the intervention
(n= 25) will participate in semi-structured focus groups
to provide feedback and their insight on the intervention
they received. Convenience sampling, due to the nature
of this study as a feasibility and effectiveness study, will
be used for all working packages.
Recruitment
For WP 1.1 (qualitative work) and WP 2 (feasibility and
effectiveness study), recruitment will take place in non-
healthcare settings with priority given at Sure Start Cen-
tres, nurseries and staff of the University of Manchester.
Recruitment will be contacted directly by the research
team who will conduct in-person visits at these loca-
tions. Full explanation of the study ’s objectives and
process will be provided to participants alongside a Par-
ticipant Information Sheet. Consent will be obtained in
person during recruitment.
Intervention
The final intervention, to be examined at the feasibility
and effectiveness study (WP 2), will include text mes-
sages around bedtime for first-time parents with young
children (ages 1 –3) designed to prompt, alter, reinforce
and maintain optimal bedtime routines that achieve all
necessary components (i.e. tooth brushing, reading a
book etc.). The final intervention using text messages
will build on existing cross-sectional work by this re-
search team on bedtime routines in families [ 15].
Text messages will include evidence-based Behaviour
Change Techniques (BCTs [ 19];) identified from the early
phase study. BCTs are the ‘active ingredients ’within an
intervention designed to produce a change in behaviour.
Appropriate BCTs will be selected using the Behavioural
Change Wheel (BCW [ 14];), a theory-based framework
designed to guide intervention development in a struc-
tured, systematic and evidence-based way. The interven-
tion will be aimed at first-time parents with young
children from all sociodemographic/ethnic backgrounds.
Text messages will be kept free for all participating fam-
ilies to ensure equal chances for participation. To achieve
the expected outcomes, the intervention will be delivered
for set period of time with the actual duration to be speci-
fied during the early phase study. Longer duration will
allow for the necessary observations in terms of behaviour
change, behaviour maintenance and impact on core out-
comes. Each night, parents will be given the opportunity
to opt out from the study using an easy opt-out clause
(texting LEAVE). The exact content of the messages will
be decided based on the results of the qualitative work
(WP 1.1) since all content will need to be linked toKitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:14 Page 3 of 9
appropriate BCTs based on the mapping of barriers and
facilitators into the BCW.
Data collection
For both WPs, demographic information will be col-
lected through a quick demographics form at the point
of recruitment.For WP 1.1 (qualitative work), semi-structured inter-
views will be used; the interview schedule will be devel-
oped using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF,
[20]), a framework which summarises 84 possible deter-
minants of behaviour into 14 overarching ‘theoretical
domains ’. Structuring the interviews around the TDF
domains will ensure comprehensive exploration of allFig. 1 Flowchart of proposed early phase study. Flowchart describing each work package (WP) of the proposed early phase study including

possible determinants of suboptimal bedtime routines,
therefore helping to identify the best targets for change
in our subsequent intervention. Interviews will be con-
ducted either in person or via telephone to minimise dis-
ruption and allow for a better participant experience.
Interviews are expected, based on previous experience,
to last around 30 –45 min. A guide on the qualitative
interview schedule can be found in Additional file 1.
Pre- and post-intervention scores on quality of bed-
time routines and children ’s quality of sleep will be col-
lected using an adapted text message-based assessment
of bedtime routines (Additional file 2) and the Child
Sleep Habit Questionnaire [ 21]. The child sleep ques-
tionnaire will be completed by parents, and it will in-
clude questions on sleep habits for their children. This
instrument contains a total of 22 questions on a 5-point
Likert scale (always, usually, sometimes, rarely and
never). Additional file 3contains a copy of the question-
naire. The bedtime routine questionnaire is an instru-
ment developed by the research team during their
previous work in the area, and it reflects a dynamic ap-
proach in assessing bedtime routines as they happen
[15]. To ensure accuracy, post-intervention measure-
ments will take place near the end of the intervention
and preferably within a week. However, some measure-
ments, like the bedtime routine questionnaire, due to its
nature as a text message-adapted assessment, will be
sent to participants immediately after their final inter-
vention text message.
Beliefs and attitudes towards the system will be exam-
ined by the focus groups at the end of the feasibility and
effectiveness study (WP2). The focus group moderator
will ensure that all participants are given the necessary
space to express their views about the intervention with
a special emphasis on their feedback and suggestions for
improvement. Focus groups will include semi-structured
questions on their experience of the intervention and
their beliefs and attitudes as well as their recommenda-
tions for future changes in the system. Focus groups will
be held at locations convenient to the sample. Focus
groups are expected to last 1 h. A guide on the topics
and issues to be covered at the suggested focus groups
can be found in Additional file 4.
Outcome measures
Expected outcomes for the intervention include short-
term/process outcomes such as (a) improvement in bed-
time routines for first-time parents including achieving
and maintaining all important elements of an optimalroutine (tooth brushing, book reading, avoidance of sugary
snacks etc.), (b) improvement on quality of sleep for
young children through a better routine, (c) less behav-
ioural difficulties around bedtime (e.g. tantrums, resist-
ance), (d) better parent-child interactions and (e)
improved parent and children ’ss o c i o e m o t i o n a ls t a t e .W P
2 (feasibility and effectiveness study) will evaluate the
intervention using the APEASE criteria ((a) acceptability,
(b) practicability, (c) effectiveness, (d) affordability, (e)
safety and (f) equity). APEASE criteria will be assessed
through insight data regarding retention rates, response
rates, user engagement, number/type of problems encoun-
tered, cost per participant, user feedback, preliminary
changes in a bedtime routine score pre- and post-
intervention, and user beliefs and attitudes towards the
system. Table 1presents an overview of each APEASE cri-
terion and the way in which data collection and quantita-
tive analysis will address each one of them.
Analyses
Qualitative analysis
For WP 1.1 (qualitative work), data analysis will follow a
deductive approach where each response will be mapped
into TDF domains with identified domains subsequently
linked to the Behaviour Change Wheel in order to inform
the selection of appropriate Behaviour Change Tech-
niques. This approach, specific to the TDF, mirrors the el-
ements of a thematic analysis for qualitative data, since
themes are identified and then linked to specific domains
within the framework. Overarching themes and key bar-
riers and facilitators affecting the targeting behaviour will
also be captured. The use of the TDF in the interviews will
lead to a holistic understanding of the targeted behaviour
in terms of the BCW/COM-B models. For the focus
groups (WP 2), data analysis will follow a thematic ap-
proach where key and overarching themes alongside fre-
quency counts of responses will be collected.
Quantitative analysis
Due to the nature of the study, quantitative data analysis
will focus primarily on process outcomes including re-
tention rates, response rates, user engagement, number/
type of problems encountered, cost per participant, user
feedback, preliminary changes in a bedtime routine score
pre- and post-intervention, and user beliefs and attitudes
towards the system. These analyses will be performed
through a series of descriptive and frequency statistics as
well as through a cost analysis to determine cost per
participant. For the changes in bedtime routine scores,

pre/post-intervention bedtime routine scores will be
assessed using a bedtime routine score per participant as
in [15]. That will allow for paired sample mean compari-
sons to determine significant changes.
Expert group
An expert group will be chaired by Prof Michael P. Kelly
(University of Cambridge) former director of Public Health
for National Centre for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
The expert group will include key stakeholders from aca-
demia, research, clinical pract ice (mainly public health), ed-
ucators, local authorities, the NHS and parent groups. Key
stakeholder presence is vital for (a) gathering their expert
opinion and feedback on the proposed intervention espe-
cially with regard to its delivery mechanisms and targeted
outcomes and (b) to examine, especially with local authority
and NHS representatives, possible routes for future funding
and implementation of the proposed intervention. The ex-
pert group will be hosted in Manchester, UK.
Technical and ethical considerations
The technical development and implementation of the
intervention (WP 1.2) will include the use of SafeMes-
sage. SafeMessage is a secure, online software platform
for designing, developing, sending, receiving and man-
aging research data through the use of text messages
and text surveys. SafeMessage utilises UK-based secure
servers hosted on the NHS (National Health Service)
HSCN (Health and Social Care) network that meet all
government requirements for data protection including
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For the
purpose of this project, SafeMessage will be the primary
route of communication and intervention delivery for
first-time parents. Parents will be logged into the system
using their first name and personal mobile number, and
they will pre-determine the time they want to receive
the intervention based on what time they start with their
bedtime routine. All information regarding participant
data will be safely stored in SafeMessage secure servers,
and they will be cleared at the end of the study.
Ethical considerations include working with first-time
parents and their children as part of this project, while
technical considerations include data and information
management through the use of the software and the au-
tomated text-messaging system. Regarding the former,
proposed activities have limited risk of causing harm to
participants or their children. There will be no invasive
processes associated with the early phase study. Children
will not be actively involved in the early phase study,
since their parents will be the ones receiving the text
message behaviour change intervention. All aspects of
the study will be designed in a way that minimises intru-
siveness and keeps overall time requirements and com-
mitment to a minimum. Also, the use of text messagesinstead of app-based or online approaches minimises
risk of extensive screen time exposure. Participants will
be made aware of study requirements and time commit-
ment during recruitment, and informed consent will be
sought from all participants at the time of recruitment.
There will be an easy and automated process of opting
out of the study at a time should they require to do so.
All information relating to the study will be managed
through the use of unidentifiable participants IDs. IDs
will be issued during recruitment and used throughout
the rest of the study. Hard copies of documents relating
to the study (i.e. consent forms) will be electronically
coded in password-protected, secure files and original
hard copies will be stored separately, securely stored in
locked cabinets at the University.
Discussion
Making sure that every child is given an equal chance in
life is a key priority for governments and policy makers
around the globe (i.e. Head Start in the US, baby boxes
in Nordic countries and Scotland etc.) [ 22]. Moreover,
prominent expert groups, including the Lancet Early
Childhood Steering Committee, have raised the import-
ance of investing in the health and wellbeing of young
children and first-time parents with special emphasis on
recurrent, nurturing behaviours [ 23]. Bedtime routines
are the commonest recurrent, nurturing family activity
with important implications for later life, and first-time
parents are particularly vulnerable to problematic rou-
tines [ 1]. A bedtime routine intervention for first-time
parents has the potential to provide all of the necessary
tools to achieve optimal routines with wide ranging
short- and long-term benefits. Optimal bedtime routines
include multiple preventive, beneficial health and social
activities such as tooth brushing, good dietary habits
around bedtime, book reading, consistent and appropri-
ate bed times and positive child-parent interaction.
Through optimal routines, children could potentially
lead more fulfilling lives as adults with lower incidents
of health, psychological and behavioural issues (e.g. den-
tal caries and conditions, higher school readiness, better
sleep hygiene etc.). These improvements can also lead to
wider positive public finance and health service conse-
quences through reduced need for treatment for dental
caries, reduced hospitalisations, better school attainment
and fewer school dropouts. Therefore, focusing on de-
veloping, establishing and maintaining optimal bedtime
routines is an important step in ensuring the best and
equal chances in life for all children.
Dissemination plan
The proposed dissemination plan for this early phase
study attempts to capture the dynamic and multi-faceted
nature of bedtime routines and the diverse audiencesKitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:14 Page 6 of 9
who will be interested in the study results. The dissem-
ination plan aims to (a) raise awareness around bedtime
routines and their importance for child development-
wellbeing; (b) improve understanding of the develop-
ment, maintenance and change of bedtime routines; (c)
create a connection between the research outputs, the
research community and the wider public; and (d) win
trust and secure advocacy regarding future research, de-
velopment and funding of interventions around bedtime
routines as well as utilisation of such interventions from
users (i.e. parents).
To achieve these goals, at the end of the early phase
study, it is proposed that a peer-reviewed article will be
published that will summarise key findings of the feasibil-
ity and effectiveness study and also present the technical
details relating to the development of the text messaging
system. That publication will be in an open access journal
allowing easy access for researchers, academics and the
wider public. Moreover, all participants in both work
packages and experts involved in the early phase feasibility
and effectiveness study will be offered updates on the pro-
gress of the study including a summary of key findings at
the end of the study. Additionally, special interest groups
and key stakeholders including charities (e.g. ‘Book Trust ’
due to their campaign for bedtime reading) and national
organisations and bodies (e.g. Public Health England due
to their Baby Teeth Do Matter and Dental Checks by 1
campaigns) as well as other groups (e.g. Centre for Behav-
iour Change and the Digital Health Hub at UCL due to
their particular interest in behaviour change and digital
behaviour change interventions) will be informed of the
outcomes of this study through newsletters and direct
communications.
Also, an informative, short video presentation sum-
marising the early phase feasibility and effectiveness
study and its key findings will be created and shared on
social media (especially Twitter and Facebook) and on-
line platforms (i.e. YouTube etc.) to raise awareness and
reach a different demographic (young adults and par-
ents) who might be more inclined to access, visit and
view such social media platforms. Sharing and promo-
tion of that video communication can be achieved
through the official social media accounts of the Univer-
sity of Manchester and the University of Aberdeen. Fi-
nally, MRC itself will be a key partner in further
communicating and disseminating the outcomes of this
early phase study through articles sent to the MRC ’s
blog and updates sent to the press office at MRC.
Beneficiaries
In general, bedtime routines remain a niche area of re-
search with only a few studies focusing on them. Research
on bedtime routines has focused primarily on their link to
quality of sleep with recent studies expanding on theirimplications for other areas of wellbeing and development.
Bedtime routines encompass a wealth of different activities
ranging from oral health hygie ne practices (tooth brushing)
to diet and social behaviours. Due to their multi-faceted na-
ture, bedtime routines are an area of interest that spans nu-
merous scientific and disciplinary boundaries. Bedtime
routines include elements which are relevant to psychology,
education, public health, dentistry, developmental studies
and behavioural science. Due to links between activities
undertaken as part of bedtime r outines (i.e. tooth brushing,
dietary habits, book reading etc.) and beneficial develop-
ment and wellbeing outcomes, bedtime routines can be an
area of interest for policy makers and health economists. In
this early phase study, the inter -disciplinary nature of bed-
time routines is reflected in the team ’se x p e r t i s er a n g i n g
from psychology to public health and dentistry. New in-
sights into bedtime routines can promote inter-disciplinary
work through increased awar eness of this recurrent, dy-
namic behaviour and its health, wellbeing and developmen-
tal consequences. Also, as th is early phase study aims to
develop a behaviour change intervention for bedtime rou-
tines in first time parents, valuable lessons can be learnt
and communicated with regard to the examination, under-
standing and changing of human behaviour, especially one
of a recurrent and dynamic nature and its relationship to
health outcomes.
Apart from academic beneficiaries and due to the di-
verse range of outcomes associated with good bedtime
routines, additional beneficiaries from this early phase
study include (a) first-time parents and parents with
young children in general; (b) academics and researchers
in public health, dental public health, psychology, behav-
iour change, digital health interventions, health policy,
education and child wellbeing; (c) NHS and non-NHS
practitioners especially GPs, dentists and the wider oral
health team, nurses, health visitors, and child health spe-
cialists; (d) charities, trusts, local-regional-national level
organisations specialising in child development-wellbeing
(e.g. Children ’s society), specific bedtime routines activities
(e.g. Book Trust for book reading before bed) or the health
of public in general (e.g. Public Health England); and (e)
education bodies, schools and practitioners (e.g. Education
Endowment Foundation).
The majority of listed individuals, groups and organisa-
tions will benefit from the general awareness of the out-
comes and the innovative methodology of this early phase
study. First-time parents and parents in general can bene-
fit from increased awareness of the importance of bedtime
routines, the constituent parts of a good bedtime routine
and the importance of establishing a good bedtime routine
from an early age. This benefit can be immediate for par-
ticipating first-time parents. Non-participating parents
can be reached and will benefit either directly (through
the communication plan) or indirectly through the overallKitsaras et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:14 Page 7 of 9
increased awareness and sharing of information between
the research team and the wider public. Academics, re-
searchers, policy makers and organisations can benefit
from this early phase study especially its novel and innova-
tive methodology when tackling their own research pro-
jects focusing on either human behaviour or similar
populations. Also, researchers and academics working with
deprived and ethnically diverse samples can gain valuable
information due to the inclusion of such populations in this
early phase study. Should this early phase study show
promising results then a larger and more comprehensive
study may produce positive differences in bedtime routines
in first-time parents with short and long-term benefits for
their children, parents themselves as well as public finances
and the health service. These benefits can emerge from
possible lower incidents of dental problems in children (i.e.
fewer dental caries, less need fo r treatment, fewer hospitali-
sations, fewer dental extractions etc.), better quality of sleep,
higher school readiness and school attainment with fewer
school dropouts later in life etc.
Conclusion
This proposed early stage feasibility and effectiveness
study for the development and initial test of a bedtime
routine intervention for first-time parents has the poten-
tial to influence a dynamic set of behaviours relating to
child wellbeing and development. Through this study, ini-
tial yet important evidence on the effectiveness of such
intervention can be gathered. This can allow for future
work with more advanced study designs (longitudinal and
