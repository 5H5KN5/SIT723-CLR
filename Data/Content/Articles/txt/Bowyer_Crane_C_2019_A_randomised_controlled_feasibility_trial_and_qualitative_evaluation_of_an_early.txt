Abstract
Background: Problems with oral language skills in childhood have been linked with poor educational,
employment, and mental health outcomes. In the UK, there is increasing concern about the oral language skills of
children, particularly children from areas of social disadvantage. Research emphasises the importance of the home
language environment as a fundamental bedrock for the development of oral language skills. It is vital, therefore,
that support is available to help families in need to provide the optimal language environment for their child.
Talking Together is a 6-week home visiting programme recently commissioned by Better Start Bradford to develop
parents ’knowledge of the importance of a good language environment and help to improve parent-child
interactions. This study represents the initial steps in developing a definitive trial of the Talking Together
programme.
Method: This study is a two-arm randomised controlled feasibility study in which families referred into the Talking
Together programme and consent to participate in the trial will be randomly allocated to either an intervention
group or a waiting control group. We will assess the recruitment and retention rates, the representativeness of our
sample, the appropriateness of our measures, and the sample size needed for a definitive trial. We will also carry
out a qualitative evaluation to explore the acceptability of trial procedures for families and service providers, fidelity
of delivery, time and resources for training, and barriers and facilitators to engagement with the programme. Clear
progression criteria will be used to assess suitability for a definitive trial.
Conclusion: This feasibility study will inform the development of a definitive trial of this home-based visiting
programme, which will add to the sparse evidence base on which practitioners can draw when supporting families
in need. The lessons learnt from this feasibility study will also inform the wider evaluation work of the Better Start
Bradford Innovation Hub.
Trial registration: The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry: study ID ISRCTN13251954 . Date of registration: 21
February 2019 (the trial was retrospectively registered).

Background
Over the past 10 years, a number of reports have raised
concerns about the oral language skills of children in the
UK. In particular, it is estimated that speech, language,
and communication difficulties can affect up to 50% of
children from more deprived backgrounds across the
UK [ 1]. Strong language skills underpin children ’s
educational achievement and have been found to be pre-
dictive of both social and scholastic success [ 2,3]. More-
over, early language difficulties have been linked to poor
adult mental health outcomes, particularly anxiety and
social phobia [ 4]. There is therefore clearly a national
interest in considering what can be done to support
early language development, particularly in children
from deprived backgrounds. Unfortunately, the recent
Bercow 10 report [ 1] suggests that not enough is being
done to address children ’s language needs and the Early
Intervention Foundation (EIF) recently suggested that
language should be a public health issue [ 4]. Indeed, the
EIF suggest that ‘Child language is similar to obesity and
other risk factors (such as mental health and diet) in
terms of its impact on children ’s overall wellbeing ’[4]
(page 36). Research identifies the home learning envir-
onment as the bedrock for children ’s early language de-
velopment [ 2,5], and it is therefore vital to support
families in need to foster positive parent-child interac-
tions and supportive home environments that enrich
children ’s early language learning opportunities. More-
over, it is important that practitioners working with
families have access to high-quality evidence-based pro-
grammes in order to ensure they can provide the most
effective means of support [ 6]. Unfortunately, few such
evidence-based programmes exist [ 7,8]. While recent
meta-analyses provide some preliminary evidence of the
positive impact of parent-implemented training pro-
grammes [ 9,10], these reviews also show that many of
these studies lack robust research designs and measures
of treatment fidelity, and very few of these studies are
contemporary and therefore potentially out of line with
current approaches to speech and language therapy [ 9,
10]. Moreover, none of the studies reported look at out-
comes for families for whom the language of interven-
tion is not their first language. Indeed, Tosh et al. [ 10]
exclude studies whose population included families that
have English as a second language. This paper outlines the
protocol for a feasibility study of the Talking Together
programme: a two-staged intervention that offers universal
screening of all 2-year-old c hildren and then provides a
home-visiting programme for children at risk of language
difficulties. Importantly, the programme is designed to be
used in a deprived multicultural community and delivered
in the families ’home language. The programme aims to de-
velop parents ’knowledge of the importance of a good lan-
guage environment and helps to improve parent-childinteraction with the specific aim of supporting children ’s
early language development.
The Talking Together programme was developed by
BHT Early Education and Training and has been run-
ning in Bradford for a number of years. The programme
has recently been commissioned by Better Start Brad-
ford, one of five ‘A Better Start ’programmes across the
UK, funded by the Big Lottery, with the specific aim of
improving the outcomes of children in three areas: social
and emotional development, nutrition and obesity, and
communication and language development through a
portfolio of commissioned services. Central to the work
of Better Start Bradford is the collaboration with Born in
Bradford (BiB), which enables robust evaluations of the
commissioned services [ 11] and aligns the work with
health services in the city of Bradford through BiB ’s pos-
ition as part of the Bradford Institute for Health Re-
search (BIHR) based at Bradford Teaching Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust (BTHFT). The feasibility study
described in this protocol takes the required steps to-
wards a full effectiveness evaluation of the Talking To-
gether intervention by establishing the acceptability and
feasibility of conducting a trial, including the use of
qualitative and quantitative methods to explore imple-
mentation. This study is referred to as the oTTer project
(outcomes of the Talking Together evaluation and
results) and is a collaboration between researchers at the
University of York, University of Leeds, and Born in
Bradford, and service providers at BHT Early Educa-
tion and Training, with funding from the Nuffield
Foundation.
Research aims
The aim of the oTTer project is to establish the feasibil-
ity of a definitive RCT trial of Talking Together. There
are two key objectives involved in meeting this aim:
1. To assess the feasibility of conducting a trial to
evaluate the effectiveness of Talking Together
including the acceptability of the intervention
outcome measures
2. To embed a qualitative evaluation within the oTTer
trial to identify challenges with the implementation
and delivery of the Talking Together programme as
part of a trial
Research questions
Aim 1
The research questions for aim 1 are as follows:
1. What are the recruitment and retention rates of
Talking Together established by the number of
participants who were identified, eligible,
approached, consented, randomised, completed theBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 2 of 12
programme, and followed up 6 months after
baseline?
2. How representative are the trial participants
compared to the wider population receiving the
intervention, based on key demographic indicators?
3. What are the most appropriate outcome measures
for a future definitive RCT, considering the
acceptability, reliability, data quality (completeness),
and responsiveness of administered measures?
4. What is the sample size needed for a definitive trial
based on data on intervention completion and
attrition rates, along with outcome data group
differences and variability across conditions?
5. How acceptable are the intervention and trial
procedures for practitioners and families, including
randomisation and completion of outcome
measures?
Aim 2
The research questions for aim 2 are as follows:
1. Was the intervention delivered with fidelity to the
standardised procedures as measured by assessing
the intervention content, and the frequency and
duration of support received by participants?
2. What are the time and resources required to train
practitioners to administer the intervention, and
how do these relate to resource requirements for
definitive RCT development?
Method
The protocol has been written in line with the SPIRIT
checklist [ 12].
Setting/population
Better Start Bradford provides services to families in
three areas of Bradford, the population of which make
up approximately 12% of the entire Bradford area. These
three inner-city areas are ethnically diverse and are
among the most deprived both in Bradford and in Eng-
land [ 11]. In terms of language and communication
needs, recent government statistics show that 20% of
children in the Bradford area do not achieve expected
levels of development in communication and language
compared to a national average of 18% [ 13]. In the Bet-
ter Start Bradford areas, recent estimates suggest that
these figures are higher, with approximately 23.5% of
children not achieving expected levels in language and
communication [ 14].
Intervention
The Talking Together programme takes a two-step ap-
proach. Firstly, a universal language screening (see the
“Screening measures ”section below) is provided to thecommunity by BHT Education and Training, in which
the programme is successful in seeing over 65% of the
eligible population. From this screening data, language
development workers (LDWs; early year ’s practitioners
with specific training in children ’s early language devel-
opment) are able to identify families who may benefit
from the programme based on both child factors (i.e.
weak language development) and parent or home char-
acteristics (e.g. parent-child interaction, a lack of devel-
opmentally appropriate materials in the home). This
combined approach to identifying appropriate recipients
of intervention is in line with the recent recommenda-
tions provided by the Education Endowment Foundation
and Public Health England [ 6]. The intervention aspect
of Talking Together draws on research emphasising the
role of positive parent-child interaction in early language
development and equips parents with the skills and
knowledge to provide a supportive home learning envir-
onment. Talking Together currently serves a culturally
diverse and deprived inner-city population, and the
programme was developed to be appropriate for delivery
to families from a range of cultural and linguistic back-
grounds. This is a particular strength of the programme,
given the growing need for interventions that can adapt
to the needs of the increasingly diverse UK population.
Talking Together is delivered by trained LDWs in the
child ’s home on a 1:1 basis with individual parents/
carers. The programme consists of six weekly, hour-long
sessions followed by a review approximately 3 to 4
months after the intervention. The Talking Together
programme aims to give parents/carers the knowledge,
understanding, and tools to improve their child ’s com-
munication skills. Weekly sessions cover five topic areas
related to improved language and communication, in-
cluding what is communication, play, attention and lis-
tening, turn taking, praise and encouragement, and a
final overview session. During these sessions, LDWs pro-
vide information about the week ’s core topic and then
engage parents in conversation about their understand-
ing of the topic and how they address it in their home.
For example, on the topic of play, the session would
present factual information on the importance of play
for learning, and LDWs would then discuss parents ’own
experiences of play as a child and now with their own
child. In addition to this, LDWs observe parents ’interac-
tions with their child, and then use a range of techniques
to highlight parents ’positive behaviours and support
identification and change of less beneficial behaviours.
These techniques include praising, modelling of good
practice, and providing suggestions and examples for
parents to try themselves. A central premise of Talking
Together is that it takes a positive, child-centred ap-
proach that focuses on improving the child ’s learning
environment, rather than a parent-centred approach thatBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 3 of 12
focuses on caregiver responsibility and aptitude. This
helps to ensure that conversations are constructive, and
parents feel supported rather than judged in their
parenting.
Practitioners are required to follow a programme man-
ual, which contains session content for each week, activ-
ities for parents to complete between sessions, and
information resources for parents. Although Talking To-
gether is manualised and there is an expectation of fidel-
ity to the programme, it is also personalised to be as
suitable as possible to individual families. LDWs are en-
couraged to use their extensive training to ensure that
content is engaging, relevant, and useful as possible for
participants. They do this by getting to know the family ’s
needs and interests, and using this understanding to pro-
vide bespoke examples and activities around the core
content. In addition to this, the sixth and final review
session is an opportunity for the family and LDWs to-
gether to decide what content from the programme they
would like to consider in more depth. The LDWs then
tailor this session to be most useful for each individual
family.
LDWs also take books and simple play resources/
toys to sessions to give parents ideas on how to play
with their child and develop communication skills. As
well as delivering the session content in the home,
LDWs also assess whether the home provides a good
learning environment, looking for distractions that
may be disruptive to learning/communication devel-
opment, and advising families on how to improve the
home learning environment.
Training and quality assurance
The service provider has robust procedures to train and
support new members of staff, and monitor implementa-
tion across all staff members, to ensure fidelity. New
staff members are trained over a period of several
months, including participating in a range of mandatory
courses and extensive shadowing of other LDWs ’prac-
tice. All staff deliver at least one full course of the inter-
vention in conjunction with another LDW before being
approved for independent practice.
With regard to quality assurance, all sessions are
delivered with strict adherence to the manual and de-
livery guidelines, and this is monitored through regu-
lar observations of practice. All staff members receive
at least two observations and evaluations of their ses-
sion delivery every year by a senior LDW. Session
observations are video recorded, and staff review their
delivery with a senior member of staff to ensure that
programme content is fully covered and practitioners ’
skills are supported and developed. In addition to
this, all staff participate in regular supervision with
members of the senior staff, to further ensureconsistency in programme delivery and staff members ’
professional practice.
Comparator
At present, Talking Together operates a waiting list
and a proportion of families therefore naturally ex-
perience a delay between referral and intervention.
The maximum waiting time any family should experi-
ence under standard practice is 6 months. For the
study, families allocated to the waiting control group
will receive Talking Together 6 months after their
baseline assessment; mirroring and not exceeding the
current maximum wait time for families. At this
point, they will be reassessed before they receive the
Talking Together intervention as part of routine care.
If at this reassessment the LDW concludes on the
basis of the assessment measures that the family no
longer requires Talking Together, they will be dis-
charged from the service as is standard practice.
Design
This will be a two-arm randomised controlled feasibility
study, with an experimental group and a waiting control
group. Families will be randomised following baseline
data collection collected at the standard universal
screening assessment delivered in the home. The fam-
ilies allocated to the experimental group will receive the
Talking Together programme within approximately 2
weeks of allocation, while the families allocated to the
waiting control group will receive the programme after a
6-month waiting period. While the average waiting time
in standard practice varies depending on a number of
factors, with the majority of families seen within 3 to 4
months, many families wait up to 6 months for interven-
tion. In order that we can ensure time of data collection
is comparable across the intervention and waiting con-
trol groups, we have time-locked the assessments at 2
and 6 months following pre-test thereby mirroring but
not exceeding the maximum wait time. Families will be
fully informed of the timeline of the project at recruit-
ment, it will be made clear that families do not have to
participate in oTTer to receive Talking Together, and
full information regarding withdrawal procedures will be
provided.
Feasibility and implementation outcomes will be mea-
sured using child language assessments, measures of
home learning environment and parent-child relation-
ship, and monitoring data in the form of, for example,
referral rates, waiting times, attrition rates, and comple-
tion rates.
Based on the recent MRC guidance [ 15], our qualita-
tive evaluation is underpinned by the conceptual frame-
work for implementation fidelity by Hasson [ 16], e.g.
focusing on measures of adherence and potentialBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 4 of 12
moderators. This framework is embedded within our
wider implementation evaluation work [ 17]. Qualitative
data will be collected through interviews with service
providers to explore any issues with running the
programme as part of a trial. These interviews will take
place immediately after follow-up assessment has been
completed for the intervention group. In addition, we
will invite a sample of oTTer families to take part in
structured interviews to explore their experiences of par-
ticipation in the oTTer project. Topic guides will be
based on the Theoretical Domains Framework, a widely
used framework in behaviour change and implementa-
tion research [ 18,19]. While the conceptual framework
for implementation fidelity is the overall evaluation
framework and outlines the key research questions, use
of the TDF allows an in-depth exploration of the barriers
and facilitators of implementing the trial.
While this research is being carried out within a di-
verse community, interpreters will not be used in the de-
livery of the Talking Together programme or any of the
data collection. The eligibility criteria state that families
must speak one of either English, Urdu, or Punjabi to
their child and we have LDWs, RAs, and PDRAs who
can speak to the families in their home language without
the use of interpreters.
Eligibility
Families
Inclusion The inclusion criteria for families are as
follows:
/C15Families must live in the Better Start Bradford reach
area.
/C15Families must have a child aged two to two and a
half years when referred into the Talking Together
programme following a screening assessment by a
LDW.
/C15Families must be willing to receive the intervention
delivered by a LDW in their home.
/C15Families need to allow the intervention programme
to be delivered with the same primary parent/carer
at each session. More than one parent/carer may be
present at the sessions, but there must be one
consistent parent/carer who is present at all
sessions.
/C15Families must be willing to be randomly allocated to
treatment or control group and consent to
additional data collection if allocated to the control
group.
/C15Families must speak English, Urdu, or Punjabi as the
primary language with their child established via
assessment and observation by a language
development worker.Exclusion The exclusion criteria for families are as
follows:
/C15Children who have any known significant
developmental disorder or sensory impairment.
/C15Families who are referred into the Talking Together
programme at the request of external bodies, i.e.
safeguarding authorities.
/C15Families where the primary carer/parent to whom
the intervention programme will be delivered may
vary from session to session.
Service providers
Inclusion The inclusion criterion for service providers is
as follows:
/C15Staff must be LDWs or senior staff involved in the
administration and delivery of the Talking Together
programme at BHT Early Education and Training.
Exclusion The exclusion criterion for service providers
is as follows:
/C15Staff who were not involved with Talking Together
in the Better Start Bradford reach area during the
time of recruitment to the trial.
Recruitment and randomisation
Sample size
Based on existing recruitment data, over the 9-month
period of recruitment, we would expect BHT Education
and Training to screen approximately 670 families and
refer approximately 250 families to the Talking Together
programme, although not all of these families will be eli-
gible for the trial or consent to take part. Recommenda-
tions for feasibility studies suggest that at least 30
participants per group will allow sufficient precision
when estimating study summary measures [ 20,21]. As
such, our minimum required sample size is 60 families.
However, we have set a desired sample size of 120 fam-
ilies, which is in excess of the recommended 60 partici-
pants for a feasibility study [ 14,15], to allow for attrition
and provide more confidence that a future definitive trial
can be successfully conducted (see Fig. 1)[14]. Cur-
rently, all families within Better Start Bradford with chil-
dren of 2 years of age are offered a language screening
home visit. For the purposes of recruitment, the LDWs
will provide families with an information sheet and con-
sent form to take part in the trial at the end of these lan-
guage screening visits if the family is going to be
referred to Talking Together and meets the oTTer eligi-
bility criteria. Families who consent to take part in theBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 5 of 12
trial will then be randomly allocated to the intervention
group or the waiting control group (see Fig. 2).
Randomisation (1:1) will be carried out by a member
of the data management (DM) team within BiB. Statis-
tical software package STATA ( ‘ralloc ’command) will
be used to generate a random list stratified by (a)
whether the family was within a specific Children ’s
Centre reach area, (b) language of delivery (English or
not), and (c) whether two or more children will be
present during delivery of the intervention, using a block
size of eight. Referrals from the LDWs with informedconsent to take part in the trial will be entered onto
SystmOne, a secure healthcare system managed by
BTHFT. Once a week, the DM team will carry out ran-
domisation and enter the allocation details onto Syst-
mOne. The deputy language development programmes
manager will then access the randomisation details and
allocate families to the research assistants and LDWs as
appropriate so that a schedule of assessment and inter-
vention can be devised. It is not possible to fully blind
the LDWs, RAs, and post-doctoral research assistant
(PDRA). The LDWs and RAs will carry out the
Fig. 1 Flow chart of feasibility study of Talking Together programmeBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 6 of 12
assessments with the intervention and control group re-
spectively and therefore cannot be blinded to group
membership. The PDRA will only have access to anon-
ymised data, but will know the group allocation of all
anonymous participants for the purposes of monitoring
trial procedures and data analyses.
Qualitative evaluation
For interviews, we will invite all LDWs and a purpos-
i v es a m p l eo fo T T e rf a m i l i e st op a r t i c i p a t e .F o rs e r -
vice provider interviews, we are aiming to recruit a
minimum of 50% of LDWs along with all members of
the senior staff team involved with the Talking
Together programme. For family interviews, we are
aiming to recruit 20 to 30 oTTer families (10 –15
from the intervention arm, and 10 –15 in the waitingcontrol arm) who are representative of the range of
diversity in the sample. A pu rposive sampling frame-
work based on key characteristics of families (e.g.
main language spoken to child ,e t h n i c i t y ,g r o u pa l l o -
cation, number of children in home) will be used to
identify and invite families in the oTTer study to take
part in interviews. Invitations will be made via the
LDWs during a routine visit. Consent will be taken at
the point of invitation, and it will be made clear that
families will be contacted by a RA to arrange an
interview. During this follow-up contact, families will
be given the opportunity to withdraw consent to take
part in the interview, and they will again be reminded
of the right to withdraw prior to the start of the
interview itself. Interviews will take place in the fam-
ilies own home.
Fig. 2 Procedure for recruitment and consent in the oTTer feasibility studyBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 7 of 12
All LDWs and senior staff with responsibility for Talk-
ing Together will be approached to take part in inter-
views once recruitment has finished. All LDWs (approx
15) and senior staff ( n= 3) will receive a letter from the
research team inviting them to participate in interviews.
Interviews will be scheduled in discussion with the dep-
uty language development programmes manager to en-
sure maximum participation with minimum disruption
to service. The interviews will be carried out by a PDRA
who has not previously worked with the BHT team and
who can complete the interviews without the support of
an interpreter.
Measures
Primary outcomes
Our primary feasibility outcome is recruitment to the
trial. We will record the following:
/C15Number of parents receiving the universal screening
/C15Number of parents eligible to receive Talking
Together
/C15Number of parents offered Talking Together
/C15Number of parents accepting Talking Together
/C15Number of parents eligible for the feasibility study
/C15Number of parents not eligible for the feasibility
study and reason why
/C15Number of parents approached to take part in the
feasibility study
/C15Number of parents consenting to take part in the
feasibility study
Secondary outcomes
In order to fully explore feasibility, there are a number
of secondary outcomes:
1. Training and QA
(a) Length of time taken to train staff to deliver
Talking Together
(b) Number of staff trained to deliver Talking
Together
(c) Programme delivery quality assurance (collected
routinely by BHT)
2. Data collection
(a) Number, proportion, and timing of parent
withdrawals from the Talking Together
intervention and feasibility study and reasons for
withdrawal
(b) Number and proportion of parents with
quantitative data at each time point
(c) Missing item level data on intervention outcome
measures at each time point
3. Sample size estimation
(a) Difference between arms and 95% confidence
intervals for the two main child languagemeasures (see the “Screening measures ”section
and “Intervention outcome measures ”section
below) at 6-month follow up
4. Adherence and moderators
(a) Based on Hasson [ 15], our evaluation will use
quantitative and qualitative data to look at
adherence and potential moderators. To
measure adherence, we will collect data on
frequency and number of sessions delivered, and
completion rate of families. To explore potential
moderators, we will obtain feedback on
acceptability of trial procedures provided by
parents, LDWs, and senior staff at BHT via
interviews; feedback on the acceptability of the
programme provided by parents via interview;
feedback on ease of delivery of the programme
provided by service providers via interview; and
data on implementation fidelity through
evaluation of quality assurance records.
Screening measures
The Universal Language Assessment (baseline) is com-
prised of two measures, which are used in conjunction
with observation of the home and parent-child inter-
action to inform LDWs ’judgement about referral to the
intervention:
1. BHT Language Screener Measure: this assessment
was created by BHT in conjunction with speech
and language therapists as well as academic
partners. It is comprised of ten statements about
children ’s current language skills scored on a 3-
point scale (the child does not do this yet, does this
sometimes, does this often). LDWs also record their
specific reason for referring into the programme
(language and communication, child behaviour, par-
ent behaviour, home learning environment, sup-
porting a family with complex needs).
2. The Oxford Communication Development
Inventory-Short (CDI-Short) [ 22]: a validated meas-
ure of early language development comprised of
100 vocabulary items. Parents complete this with
the support of the LDW and indicate words the
child can (a) say and (b) understand. This measure
is used as an indication of conceptual vocabulary,
and parents are asked to indicate which words their
child can say and understand in any of the lan-
guages they speak. It is a parent-report measure
that takes approximately 10 min to complete
Intervention outcome measures
One of the goals of this feasibility study is to establish the
most suitable measures for use as intervention outcomes.
After an extensive search we selected two measures thatBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 8 of 12
were suitable in terms of ease of use, time taken to admin-
ister, and suitability for use with multilingual families. We
recognise the limitations inherent in direct translations of
language measures but have selected measures that we are
confident have attempted to do this as reliably as possible.
All outcome measures will be administered at pre-test,
post-test, and follow-up.
Two outcomes will be evaluated to determine which is
most suitable as a primary outcome for future definitive
trial at 6 months follow-up:
1. The Oxford Communication Development
Inventory-Short (CDI-Short) [ 22]: This assessment
is re-administered as an outcome measure.
2. The WellComm language assessment [ 23]: a
validated, direct, and objective assessment of
children ’s language development. The measure is
completed through questions with parents and
observation of the child by the LDW. The
assessment can be directly translated into Asian
languages up to section 5 ( https://www.gl-
assessment.co.uk/support/support-videos/
wellcomm-support-videos/ ). Where families are
receiving the intervention in a language other than
English, the LDW will deliver the WellComm
assessment in the primary language of the child.
Three additional measures will be evaluated for feasi-
bility as potential secondary outcomes:
1. Maternal Object Relations Scale (MORS) [ 24]: this
is a validated self-report measure which assesses
parent/carer and child relationships and attach-
ment. LDWs help parents complete the measure,
and it will be administered in the dominant lan-
guage of the parent.
2. Home learning environment questionnaire (HLEQ)
[25]: an indicator of the types and frequency of
activities in the home shown to be predictive of
children ’s later language skills. LDWs help parents
complete the measure, and it will be administered
in the dominant language of the parent. This
measure has not currently been validated.
3. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)
[26]: this is a validated measure of children ’semotional and behavioural adjustment. The scale
consists of five subscales: emotional symptoms,
conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer
relationship problems, and prosocial behaviour. For
the purposes of this study, only the hyperactivity
and conduct subscales are administered. It should
be noted that while validated as a whole measure,
the SDQ not been validated to be used in this way.
However, a pragmatic decision was made to reduce
the measure to these two subscales as the entire
SDQ is too long to administer alongside the other
quantitative measures. LDWs help parents complete
the measure, and it will be administered in the
dominant language of the parent.
Data collection
As our outcome measures are administered routinely by
LDWs, and in order to avoid repeat assessments, data
will be collected by both LDWs and research staff. Base-
line data will be collected during universal language as-
sessment sessions by LDWs as standard practice. Pre-
test and post-test data will be collected by LDWs for the
experimental group and RAs for the waiting control
group. Six-month follow-up assessments in both treat-
ment arms will be carried out by trained RAs accompan-
ied by a LDW familiar with the family to maintain
consistency and make clinical judgements about the
need for ongoing input. LDWs and RAs will receive the
same training in administering the assessments and will
carry out reciprocal observations of assessments. The
timeline for assessment can be seen in Fig. 3.
Qualitative interviews with the service provider and
families will be collected by a PDRA not responsible for
collecting any other trial data. We will carry out inter-
views with service providers after recruitment to the trial
has ended. All LDWs and members of the Talking To-
gether management team will be invited to take part in
these interviews. We will invite a purposive sample of
oTTer families to participate in interviews at the end of
their follow-up period (approximately 6 months after the
baseline assessment). Interviews will be carried out in
person or by phone at the convenience of the families.
All qualitative work will be completed 24 months after
recruitment commenced.

Statistical analysis
No interim analysis is planned. Statistical analyses will
be carried out after all outcome data has been collected.
Feasibility objectives and acceptability of intervention
outcome measures will be assessed using descriptive
analysis, focusing on confidence interval estimation, ra-
ther than formal hypothesis testing. To assess the suit-
ability of the intervention outcome measures for use
with multilingual families, we will compare quality and
responsiveness of the measures in families who do and
do not speak English as their primary language.
Qualitative analysis
Qualitative data from interviews will be transcribed and
checked for accuracy against the original audio record-
ings. Anonymised transcripts will be analysed using the
Nvivo data management programme (NVivo qualitative
data analysis software; QSR International Pty Ltd) and
analysed following a two-stage approach. In stage 1,
transcripts will be coded to the domains of the TDF to
extract the barriers and facilitators of implementing the
trial from the perspective of service providers and fam-
ilies, followed by an inductive analysis of the themes
within each domain. We will also explore any patterning
of themes by individuals ’ethnicity, socioeconomic cir-
cumstances, and English language ability. Transcripts
will be coded systematically and iteratively until satur-
ation is achieved. Ten percent of transcripts will be
coded by a second researcher to ensure reliability of the
coding framework.
Progression criteria
Progression to definitive trial will be informed by the re-
sults of three main progression criteria, based on Avery
et al. [ 27]. A traffic light system will be used with red as
an indication not to progress to trial and green indicat-
ing progression to trial. Amber indicates potential pro-
gress to trial with careful consideration of why these
criteria did not reach green.
1. Recruitment —we anticipate a minimum of 60% of
families identified and offered the intervention will
be eligible to participate in the trial, and a
minimum of 50% of these eligible families will
consent to participate in the trial. These numbers
will be assessed cumulatively over the course of the
recruitment phase. Progression criteria are as
follows:
(a) Eligibility —60% and above = green, 50 –60% =
amber, and below 50% = red
(b) Consent —50% and above = green, 40 –50% =
amber, and below 40% = red2. Protocol adherence —families will be administered
the quantitative assessment measures at specific
time points, ensuring that assessments of the
waiting control group align with those of the
intervention group. Feasibility of running a trial
using this design is dependent on the ability to
adhere to the following timeline: pre-test within 1
month of Universal Language Screener, post-test 6
to 10 weeks following pre-test, and follow up at 5.5
months to 6.5 months after pre-test. Progression de-
cisions will therefore be based on percentage adher-
ence rates, i.e. 80% = green, 60 –80% = amber, and
less than 60% = red.
3. Attrition rates —based on previous reported
attrition rates for Talking Together, we have
calculated a predicted attrition rate over the course
of the trial. Progression decisions will be based on
the proportion of the recruited sample that attends
the 6-month follow-up, i.e. 80% = green, 70% =
amber, and below 70% = red.
Data monitoring and confidentiality
Quantitative outcome data and monitoring data
BHT Early Education and Training, BiB, and Better Start
Bradford have a data sharing agreement. Where partici-
pants have consented to data sharing, data will be trans-
ferred to BiB automatically through the SystmOne
database, i.e. SDQ, MORS, home learning environment,
CDI, and WellComm, as well as recruitment and moni-
toring data. A data sharing agreement is also in place be-
tween BiB and the University of York, allowing BiB as
data controller to share anonymised data with the PI
and research team as data processors. Data quality will
be monitored as a standing item on the monthly oTTer
meeting agenda.
Qualitative data
RAs will upload audio recordings of interviews to pass-
word protected NHS laptops. Once uploaded, the record-
ings will be held in BiB on a secure computer server and
deleted from the laptop and audio recording equipment.
Transcripts will be anonymised before analysis and stored
on a central secure computer at BiB. Only anonymised
scripts will be shared with the research team for analysis
and recordings will be destroyed after transcription.
Project oversight
The programme management team is made up of the
principal investigator, co-investigators, PDRA, data man-
ager, and research assistants. The team will meet
monthly to monitor the progress of the project, discuss
challenges, set priorities, and talk about next steps.
The proposed project sits within the existing work of
Better Start Bradford and BiB, and will therefore comeBowyer-Crane et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:119 Page 10 of 12
under the purview of an established structure of expert
and stakeholder advisory groups [ 11]. As such (and given
the low risk nature of the research), a separate Data
Monitoring and Ethics Committee is not required. This
network of existing groups will enable the research team
to ensure that the project is embedded in the wider con-
text of Better Start Bradford and BiB.
In addition, a bespoke advisory group will be convened
with oversight for this specific project. This group will
be made up of members from the existing advisory
groups related to the wider work of BiB and Better Start
Bradford ’s language and communication work, and par-
ent representatives from the community. This group will
meet with the research team biannually over the course
of the project and advise on key methodological deci-
sions, outputs, and dissemination. Meetings will be held
in Bradford to ensure community members are able to
attend. We will also seek advice from relevant members
of the advisory board outside of these meetings as
appropriate.
Publication policy
The study falls under the rubric of the Better Start Brad-
ford Innovation Hub and will therefore use the Better
Start Bradford Innovation Hub publication policy that
follows the BMJ rules on authorship and contributorship
to guide decisions around publications ( https://www.
bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/article-submis-
sion/authorship-contributorship ). The publication policy
is held at BiB and has been agreed by all BiB collabora-
tors working on the Better Start Bradford programmes.
Trial status
The trial is open and has been recruiting since October
2018. The trial was registered with ISRCTN in February
2019.
Discussion
Recent reports have raised awareness of the need for in-
creased early support for children with speech, language,
and communication needs [ 1,4]. Oral language difficulties
have been linked with poor ed ucational, employment, and
mental health outcomes [ 4]. Research suggests that a strong
foundation in language is fundamental to later language
skills, and a corollary of this is that a communication-rich
home language environment is key. However, the evidence
for programmes that support parents in providing this
strong foundation is lacking [ 6]. This programme of work
is the first step towards developing a definitive randomised
controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of one such
programme: Talking Together. Designed and delivered by
BHT Early Education and Training, the programme is one
of a suite of services provided as part of the Better Start
Bradford project and aims to improve children ’sl a n g u a g eoutcomes through improving parent-child interactions.
This study aims to inform the feasibility of delivery of a fu-
ture definitive trial and as such will not provide evidence of
effectiveness. However, it will provide invaluable informa-
tion regarding the feasibility of using random allocation
without adversely impacting on service delivery. It will iden-
tify the most effective measures to be used as primary and
secondary outcomes (and how they can be administered),
and through the qualitative work with service providers, it
will identify any issues of implementation both for the ser-
vice as a whole and for the service as part of the trial. Our
qualitative work with families will help to identify barriers
and facilitators to engaging w ith the Talking Together
programme from an ethnically and socioeconomically di-
verse community. This increased understanding will lead to
more informed commissioning decisions and service
provision within Bradford and elsewhere, as well as provid-
ing the foundation for a large-scale RCT of the Talking To-
gether programme.
