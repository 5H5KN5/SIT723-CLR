 The aim of the research was t o evaluate the impact of intervention materials, designed 
to enhance self -efficacy and anticipated regret, on contraceptive behaviour and antecedents of 
contraceptive use in a sample of adolescents. It was hypothesised that materials designed to 
enhance self efficacy and anticipated regret wou ld lead to improvements in outcome measures 
compared with controls.   A 4(intervention condition) by 3(time) mixed design was used to assess 
the impact of intervention materials.   Participants (N=414) were recruited from five secondary 
schools in the north of England.  They were assigned to either an active control group, an 
anticipated regret (AR) manipulation, a self -efficacy (SE) manipulation, or both AR and SE 
manipulations. Outcome measures included psychological antecedents of contraceptive behaviour 
change, intentions and behaviour.   MANOVA revealed increases across several outcome 
measures over time (F[1 4, 287]=8.99, p<.001, ηp2=.305)  including intentions, but these did not 
differ by condition (F[4 2, 852]=1.35, p=.07, ηp2=.062).  There was evidence that  the 
questionnaires may have caused reactivity in participants . Amongst sexually active participants 
with relatively low levels of intention to use contraception at the outset, increases in several outcome measures including intention and behaviour were ob served (F[3, 35]=10 .359, 
p<.001,η
p2=.47).  Findings support the potential for effective delivery of behaviour change 
theory- driven interventions in classroom settings.  The possibility  that the questionnaires may 
have acted as a form of  intervention contributes to recent discussion of this issue in the literature , 
and the findings also strengthen the case for  post-decisional  and behavioural skills interventions 
to enhance behaviour amongst those already motivated to use contraception.

2 Improving adolescent contraceptive use : Evaluation of a theory-driven 
classroom -based intervention  
 
In 2008, 38 750 under 18 year -olds conceived in England alone, and just over  half led to live 
births (ONS, 2010).   D espite evidence of modest decline these rates remain the highest in 
Western Europe (ONS, 2010).  Ra tes of sexually transmitted infections (STIs ) amongst 
adolescents continue to increase  (HPA, 20 10).  The National Teenage Pregnancy Strategy 
(Social Exclusion Unit  [SEU] , 1999) aimed to halve  rates of conception amongst under  18s 
by 2010 (from a 1998 baseline) , but this has  not be en achieved.  Similarly, the National 
Strateg y for Sexual Health and HIV aimed  to reduce the transmission of STIs amongst young 
people (D H, 2001)  but there is no evidence yet of decline (HPA, 20 10).  
In 1999, the SEU recommended good sex education, 'in schools and other places 
where young people can be reached'  (SEU,1999;  p7) and i n 2008, it was announced teaching 
Personal Social and Health Education (PSHE) including sex and relationships education 
(SRE) will become  statutory as part of the national curriculum in schools by 2011 (DCSF, 
2008)1.  Even good sex education however, based largely  on developing knowledge and 
skills, is likely to be insufficient to instil consistent safer sex behaviour  in young people (e.g. 
Abraham, Sheeran, Spears & Abrams, 1992; Richard & van der Pligt, 1991; Henderson, Wight, Raab et al., 2007).  The National Ins titute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 
has made recommendations that behaviour change theory and evidence be embedded within sexual healthcare practice (NICE, 2007), and arguably if sex education is to be effective in helping to reduce conception and STI rates in young people, a theory -driven approach to SRE 
provision should be considered.  
Considerable research has highlighted  processes underpinning motivation and 
behaviour change in relation to condom and contraceptive use (e.g. Albarracín, Gille te, Earl, 
Glasman & Durantini, 2005;  Beadnel l, Baker, Gillmore et al., 2008)  and there is growing

3 interest in  the importance of volitional (Gollwitzer, 1993) or post -intentional (Abraham , 
Sheeran, Norman et al. , 1999) processes in relation to contraceptive behaviour (Brown, 
Abraham, Joshi & Wallace, 2008; Martin, Sheeran , Slade, Wright & Dibble, 2009) .  
Motivational processes are arguably  of greatest relevance however, in classroom -based sex 
education, since audience s will likely have varying levels of sexual and contraceptive 
knowledge and experience, and must feel motivated to engage in safer sex behaviours 
consistently, (and have become sexually active) before they will require help tra nslating 
motivation into actio n (Abraham et al., 1999; Gollwitzer, 1993).  Therefore, two variables , 
self-efficacy and anticipated regret,  identified in our  research on similar samples as more 
strongly related to motivational and behavioural change for contraception than a range of others (Brown, 2006; Brown, Hurst & Arden, 2004) were selected as the focus of the present study.   These variables have also received support more widely in the literature ( e.g. 
Abarrací n et al., 2005; van Empelen, Kok, Jansen & Hoebe, 2001) . 
Rationale and ai ms 
Given that Government targets to reduce teenage pregnancy and rates of STI have not been met in the UK , and that SRE is likely  to become a statutory part of the school curriculum, it is 
arguably valuable to explore the potential contribution attempts to  manipulate variables such 
as self -efficacy and anticipated regret might make to the delivery of classroom -based sex 
education. Testing brief interventions that could be provided in  addition to current provision 
is arguably also of value.   The present stud y therefore evaluated the effect of brief paper and 
pen-based tasks on psychological antecedents of contraceptive behaviour and on self -reports 
of cont raceptive behaviour over a four -week period.  It was predicted that there would be a 
significant interaction between time and condition indicating interventions designed to increase self -efficacy and anticipated  regret  result in improved motivation and behaviour 
compared to controls .

4 Method  
Participants  
 All local education authority schools were invited to participate. F ive schools taking 
pupils aged 11 to  18 years  responded and volunteered year groups to participate . Four school s 
were attended by mainly white pupils.  Almost half of pupils from the remaining school were 
from ethnic minority groups.  Two schools recruited pupils from mainly affluent backgrounds, two from areas with high social and economic deprivation and one from average levels of socio -economic status.  Of 414 participants who completed a baseline 
questionnaire, 247 participants (126 males) completed  the inte rvention and questionnaires at 
time 2 (T2) and time 3 (T3). Attrition was due to absence from school at either one or both follow -up time points  or anonymous withdrawal through non -completion .  Table 1 provides 
further descriptive information about participants at time 1 (T1) and T3.

Design  
 A 4(condition) x 3(time) mixed design was us ed.  Participants were assigned to one of 
four intervention conditions (information- only control [IOC], self -efficacy [SE], anticipated 
regret [AR], or SE/AR combined), and measured on eight dependent variables across three time points (baseline/T1, immediately post -intervention/T2, and four -week follow -up/T3).  
The dependent variables were contraceptive behaviour (non- virgins  only ), intention, self -
efficacy, anticipated regret, control beliefs, condom outcome beliefs, pill outcome beliefs, and normative be liefs.  Counterbalancing was used for the  SE/AR combined condition.

5 Materials  
Questionnaire  
 Two questionnaire s were developed.  They differed only in making  items  gender 
appropriate. A participant -generated code of  letters and numbers from personal information 
maintain ed anonymity and allowed  data- matching across time points.  
Background measures     
Participants were asked to indicate their age, whether they had engaged in sexual 
intercourse, any religious beliefs affecting contraceptive decisions , and whether they had a) 
never had sex, b) had sex but not during the previous six months, or c) had sex within the last 
6 months. 
Psychological and behavioural m easures  
 Measures u sed seven -point Likert scale s to record r esponses .  Partici pants responded  
in relation to their main  method of contraception (or one they knew most about).   Self -
efficacy was measured using seven items adapted from Grimley, Prochaske and Prochaske 
(1997).  Example s are, ‘How confident are you that you will use a contraceptive method 
effectively every time you have sex?’ and ‘How confident are you that you will use a contraceptive method effectively if you have been drinking or taking drugs?’  with possible responses ran ging from ‘1  – very unconfident’ to ‘7 – very confident’.  A mean of these items 
comprised a reliable measure ( Cronbach's α =.83).  
  Anticipated regret was measured in two ways.  First , five items assessed regret 
following non- use of contraception and feel ings about having a pregnancy.  Example items 
are, ‘If you had sex and did not use your chosen method of contraception, how much do you think you would regret it the next day?’ and ‘How much do you like the idea of being pregnant at this stage of your life ?’ with possible responses ranging from ‘1 – not at all’ to ‘7 
– very much’.  Second, participants were asked to think about a sexual experience where they had a) used contraception properly and b) not used contraception.  If they lacked experience 
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
6 of these scenarios, they were asked to imagine them , and   completed  four semantic 
differential scales to represent assessment of  feelings after having sex when contraception 
was used and  not used properly (e.g. 1 ‘unhappy’ to 7 ‘happy’, 1 ‘not worried’ to 7 
‘worried’).  A  mean score provided a reliable composite measure ( Cronbach's α= .83).  
Theory of planned behaviour ( TPB; Ajzen, 1991)  beliefs were measured to assess 
intervention effect . Belief strength and outcome evaluation were measured for condoms (six 
paired items) and the pill  (five paired items; see Conn er & Norman, 2005).  Example items 
include, ‘ Using a condom would make sex feel safer’ multiplied by ‘Feeling that sex is safe 
is…’ and ‘Taking the pill would be an easy way to prevent pregnancy’ multiplied by 
‘Contraception being easy is …’ scored in each case from 1 ‘very likely’ to 7 ‘very unlikely’ multiplied by 1 ‘very good’ to 7 ‘very bad’ .  Analyses showed these items formed reliable 
measures for condoms ( Cronbach's α =.79) and the pill ( Cron bach's α =.8).  
Normative belief s and motivation to comply  were measured using five paired items.  
An example item is, ‘ My friends think I should use contraception every time I have sex’ 
multiplied by ‘With regard to contraception, how much do you want to do what your friends think you should?’  scored from, ‘ 1 ‘strongly agree’ to 7 ‘strongly disagree’, multiplied by, 1 
‘not at all’ to 7 ‘very much’ .  Normative belief measures tend to be less reliable than other 
TPB measures (e.g. Armitage & Conner, 2001) and those reported here reflect that (Cronbach's α =.59).  However, similar levels have been reported elsewhere (e.g. van 
Empelen et al., 2001) and are likely explained by varying  levels of importance place d on 
different  referent groups.  
Control beliefs and power were measured using nine items including  external and 
internal influences.  Example items include, ‘How often is your use of contraception affected by you taking drugs or alcohol?' multiplied by, 'If I have used drugs or alcohol before having sex, it makes my contraceptive use...' and ‘How often does your excitement or level of 
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
7 arousal during a sexual experience affect your use of contraception?’ multiplied by ‘My 
excitement or level of arousal during a sexual experience makes my contraceptive use…’ scored from, ‘1 ‘never’ to 7 ‘always’, multiplied by  1 ‘much less likely’ to 7 ‘much more 
likely’.  The mean of these multiplicative items provided a reliable measure ( Cronbach's 
α=.74).  
Intention was measured using three items , e.g. , ‘I intend to use a method of 
contraception effectively every time I have sex ’ scored from ‘1 ‘strongly agree’ to 7 ‘strongly 
disagree’ .  The mean of these items provided a composite measure ( Cronbach's α=.93).  
Contraceptive behaviour of non- virgins was measured with a single  item at baseline, 
‘I have used contraception properly every time I have had sex in the last 6 months   scored 
from ‘1 -  strongly disagree’ to ‘7 -  strongly agree’.  At T3 , the same question was asked in 
relation to the preceding  month. 
 
Intervention materi als 
The intervention materials were reading and writing based task s.  Three different sets were 
produced; a four-page  set that gave factual information about condoms and the contraceptive 
pill (IOC  condition) ; a four- page  set designed to enhance feelings o f control over pill and 
condom use ( SE condition);  a five- page  set of vignette s designed to enhance feelings of 
anticipated regret over not using contraception properly (AR condition) . The SE/AR 
condition received both sets . The intervention materials are at  
http://www.healthinterventions.co.uk/interventions/intro.aspx?section=15 .  These materials 
were laminated, and accompanied by  an OHP pen so that participants could wr ite directly on 
them  (aiding and recording engagement with the intervention) .

8 Procedure  
Ethical approval was sought before data collection began from the university ethics 
committee. Q uestionnaires and the intervention were administered by the first author.  
Participants were seated in classrooms with enough distance between them to maintain 
privacy.  At T1, questionnaires were distributed for completion, and sealed in envelopes before being  returned .  One week later, participants completed the intervention.  E nvelopes, 
each containing evenly dispersed materials for one intervention condition, a questionnaire and OHP pen were taken to each T2 data collection session.  The envelopes were marked only wi th gender, and blindly distributed.  Participants were instructed to complete the 
laminated 'workbook' first using the pen provided, and then complete the questionnaire.  Materials were re- sealed in envelopes before being returned  (enabling later identific ation of 
assigned condition).  Four weeks later , participants completed a T3 questionnaire.  
 
Analysis  
Representativeness check  
An independent samples t -test suggested that participants who were lost from analyses (at T2 
and/or T3) were significantly younge r (mean=16.31 years; SD 1.39 years) than those retained 
(mean =16.95 years; SD=1.52 years) ; t (376.134)=  -4.44, p<.001.  Although the difference 
was significant, it is relatively small ( d =.44), and suggests  greater absenteeism  amongst 
younger students .  
Chi-square analyses found a  statistically significant association between gender and 
attrition ( χ
2 =7.56, df =1, p=.006).  A greater proportion of males were lost from the study 
compared with females.  However, a greater loss of males was anticipated, based on previous 
research  (e.g. Brown, Hurst & Arden, 2004) , and more males initially  recruited, leaving 
approximately  equal numbers in the final sample.  No statistically significant association was 
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
9 found between attrition and virgin status ( χ2 = 3.59, df =1, p=.166).  Therefore, comparable 
proportions of virgins and non- virgins remained in the final sample.   
Randomisati on check  
Table 2 compares baseline descriptives by intervention condition. ANOVA was used to see if 
participants differed in  age by  condition at baseline (T1).  Analysis suggests they did not  
(F[3, 311]= .62, p= .97).  Chi -square analyses assessed  associatio n between gender and 
condition at T1, and between virgin status and condition at T1.  No significant association was found for gender (χ
2[3]=.615, p=.893),  or  virgin status (χ2[3]=1.973, p=.578).  
 Table 2 about here  
A between -subjects MANOVA carried out on the T1 DVs , with condition as the 
between -subjects IV, showed that there were significant differences at T1 (F[24, 
870.69]=1.77, p=.014).  Univariate analyses suggested differences occurred only on the baseline meas ure of intention (F[3, 307]=3.17, p=.025).  Bonferroni post -hoc comparisons 
suggest differences were attributable  to a intention in the AR condition (mean=5.43)  and the 
SE/AR condition (mean=6.01) .  This difference at baseline was adjusted for, by followin g 
MANOVA with ANCOVA using the baseline measure of intention as a covariate.  This 
confirmed that significant effects for intention reported below were retained after accounting 
for differences at baseline.  
Effect of intervention on the whole sample  (by gen der) 
Table 3  shows the means and standard deviations of participants' scores on DVs by 
intervention condition and gender.  Because of a  difference between males ' and females'  
scores, g ender was included as a between -subjects variable in initial analysis to  assess 
differential effect. A 4(condition) x 3(time) x 2(gender) MANOVA conducted on 7 DVs 
(intention, self -efficacy, anticipated regret, pill outcome beliefs, condom outcome beliefs, 
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
10 control beliefs and normative beliefs) ,  showed a significant main effe ct of gender (F[ 7, 
294]=1.96, p<.001,η p2=.248) , condition (F[ 21,845] =1.97, p=.003,η p2=.047), and time (F[14, 
287]=8 .99, p<.001,η p2=.305), but  no significant interaction of time by condition (F[4 2, 
852]=1. 35, p=.0 7,η p2=.062) , or time by gender (F[14, 287]=1.01, p=. 363,η p2=.051) or time 
by condition by gender (F[42, 852] =1.07, p=. 362,η p2=.049).  
Univariate tests showed  a main effect of time for intention (F[2, 608]=26.25, 
p<.001, η p2=.079), self -efficacy (F[2, 608]=17.74, p<.001,η p2=.055), anticipated regret (F[2, 
608]=5.13, p=.006,η p2=.017), pill outcome beliefs  (F[2, 608]=21.4, p<.001, η p2=.068), and 
normative beliefs (F[2, 608]=8.93, p<.001,η p2=.028).  Univariate tests of the between -
subjects IVs showed that none of the DVs differed si gnificantly by intervention condition 
despite the significant multivariate F (all ps between .213 and .850).  However, univariate 
tests showed that the main effect of gender existed for all of the DVs (a ll Fs fell between 
13.82 and 69.34 and all p  values w ere less than .001 , all η p2 between .044 and .188) . 
Insert table 3  about here  
Consultation of means for intention, self -efficacy, anticipated regret, pill outcome 
beliefs and normative beliefs by time suggested that in each case an increase in mean score occurred between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3. The findings from  pairwise 
comparisons are indicated in table 4 below.  Significant p values for T1- T2 indicate 
immediate increases , while significant p values for T2- T3 and T1- T3 indicate later or 
sustained increases  in scores .  
 Insert table 4 about here  
Although there was a significant main effect of gender, there were no significant 
interactions between g ender and the other IVs su ggesting  that differences between males and 
females, did not reflect a differential impact of the intervention .  Consideration of means 
indicates that for each DV , males scored lower than females ( see table 3).   
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
11 Investigation of the significant main effec t of time suggests that taking part in this 
study significantly increased participants’ intentions to use contraception, their self -efficacy 
regarding use of contraception, their levels of anticipated regret regarding not using 
contraception, improved outc ome beliefs about pill use, and the strength of their normative 
beliefs regarding use of contraception.  These increases occurred regardless of intervention condition.  The main effect for gender demonstrate s that females have more positive beliefs 
and int entions regarding contraception, but increases observed do not differ by gender.  
Effect s for virgins and non -virgins  
4(condition) x 3(time) MANOVAs were conducted separately on virgins and non- virgins , to 
assess differential  intervention effect s.  This als o enabled  analysis of behavioural data  among  
non-virgins. Findings were similar to the main analysis above for both sub- samples.  There 
were main effects of time (virgins; F[16, 129]=4.23, p<.001, η
p2=.344; non -virgins; F[17, 
87]=4.24, p<.001, η p2=.453) but not condition (virgins; F[24, 397.94]=1.21, p=.231, 
ηp2=.066; non- virgins; F[27, 278.09] =1.44, p=.079, η p2=.119).  There was no significant 
interaction of time by condition ( virgins; F[48, 384.47]=.92, p=.62, η p2=.103;  non- virgins; 
F[51, 259.82]=4.24, p=.168, η p2=.191).  
Amongst virgins, statistically significant increases were seen over time for intention 
(F[2, 288] =14.89, p<.001), self -efficacy (F[2, 288] =17.81, p< .001), pill outcome beliefs  (F[2, 
288]= 14.39, p< .001), and normative beliefs (F[2, 288]=7.72, p=.001).  Amongst non- virgins, 
statistically significant increases were seen over time for intention (F [2, 206] =10.01, p<.001), 
and pill outcome beliefs  (F[2, 206]=13.96, p<.001). No significant increases in ef fective 
contraceptive use were found.

12 Intention to treat (ITT) analysi s   
ITT analysis was performed on the data to assess whether results differed if participants who 
had completed T2 and  dropped out by T3 were included.  Where T3 data were missing for 
participants' scores on the DVs, they were replaced with T1 data.  Findings broadly replicated 
those reported above with a significant  main effect of time (F[14,261]=6.66, p<.001, 
ηp2=.263), a small significant main effect of condition but with a very small effect  size (F[21, 
770.1]=1.72, p=.0 23, η p2=.043), and no significant main effect of time x condition 
(F[42,775]=.785, p=.834, η p2=.04).  U nivariate test s for the main effect of time show that 
intention, efficacy, anticipated regret and pill and condom outcome beliefs all significantly increased ( ps from .012 to <.001).  
Effect s on those with weaker intentions versus stronger intentions to use contraception  
Baseline measures of intention to use contraception by participants wer e generally strong 
(overall T1 mean=5.69 on a scale of 1 to 7 where 7 is high). Although findings show a statistically significant increase in  levels of intention to use contraception amongst all 
participants, it is possible that for a  sub- group of non- virgin participants who had rel atively 
lower levels of intention at the outset of the study , a shift in intention  translated into 
significant improvements in contraceptive behaviour that are masked by the inclusion of all  
non-virgins in the analyse s above .  
Using a mean split (scores of  6.01 or below), a sub -sample of non- virgins whose 
intentions to use contraception were relatively low at the outset of the study were identified (N=84).   Table 5  shows mean and standard deviations for this sub- sample on the DVs 
intention and behaviour by time, condition of the intervention and by gender (to again assess 
differential impact on behaviour in males compared with females).   Behavioural data were 
only recorded at baseline (T1) and T3, so no T2 data are reported for this variable.

A 4(condition) x 2(gender) x 3(time) mixed MANOVA was conducted on the sub-
sample of low intending non- virgins, with the dependent variables intention and behaviour.  
There was no significant main effect of condition (F[6, 72]=1.57, p=0.169, η p2=.116) or 
gender (F[2, 36]=1.40, p=0.26, η p2=.072).  There was no significant interaction of time by 
condition (F[ 9, 85]=1. 25, p=0.275, η p2=.096) or time by gender (F[ 3, 35]=0. 764, p=0. 522, 
ηp2=.061) or time by condition by gender (F[ 6, 70 ]=1.679, p=0.139, η p2=.126).  There was 
however, a highly significant main effect of time (F[ 3, 35]=10 .359, p< .001, η p2=.47). 
Univariate tests  suggest that the main effect of time was due to both intention (F[ 1.89, 
12.57]=18.17, p< 0.001, η p2=.329) and behaviour (F[ 1, 9.82]=4.76, p=0. 036, η p2=.114).  
Consideration of means for the main effect of time suggested that intention increased 
from T1 (m=4.94) toT2 (m=5.80) and increased again by T3 (m=6.16).  Pairwise 
comparisons for intention show that the increase between T1 a nd T2 was significant 
(p<0.001), as was the increase between T2 and T3 ( p<0.001).   Estimated marginal means for 
behaviour , measured at baseline and four -week follow -up, suggest that effective 
contraceptive behaviour increased from T1 (m=5.73) to T3 (m=6.39).  Pairwise comparis ons 
suggest that this increase wa s significant  (p<.001) .   
These findings remain when the more conservative ITT analyses are run , showing  no 
significant main effect of condition ( F[6,112]=1.78, p=.1 ,ηp2=.087), and no significant time 
by condit ion interaction (F[9,168]=1.08, p=.382,η p2=.055 ).  The significant main effect of 
time remains (F[3, 54]=11.86, p<.001, η p2=.397).  
 
Discussion  
A significant interac tion between time and condition, indicating self -efficacy and anticipated 
regret i nterventions improved motivation and behaviour compared to controls , was predicted . 
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
14 Findings revealed significant increases in several DVs (intention, self -efficacy, anticipated 
regret, pill outcome beliefs and normative beliefs) over time, but this did not occur 
differentially by condition of the intervention. This was replicated amongst a sub -sample of 
virgins (with improvements in intention, self -efficacy, pill outcome beliefs and normative 
beliefs) and amongst non -virgins (with increases in intention an d pill outcome beliefs). Self -
reported contraceptive use did not increase amongst all  non- virgins, but  significant increases 
in intention and behaviour were observed amongst non- virgins with  lower intentions to use 
contraception at baseline.  All  findings were replicated when ITT analyses were applied.  
The finding that intervention conditions perform no better than control s, in sexual 
health intervention research with  adolescents has been commonplace (Bennett & Assefi, 
2005; Dicenso, Guyatt, Willan & Griffi th, 2002; Robin, Dittus, Whitaker, et al., 2004).  
Congruent with explanations for similar findings provided by Wight, Raab, Henderson et al. 
(2002), it may be that more intense and frequent messages from wider social influences 
outwei gh the  impact of a br ief task , or that more time was needed  for impact to be observed. 
It is also possible that despite the messages used being based in our previous research, the beliefs focussed on did not represent the most salient for the sample, and that messages spread a cross condom and pill use may have weakened their effect.   
The finding that several DVs increased  over time, despite the lack of differentiation 
by condition, is important.  O bserved i ncreases in intention to use contraception across the 
sample , and in sel f-reported use , for non -virgins with lower  baseline intentions  provide 
particular interest . Given the short duration of the present study, there is unlikely to be a 
developmental effect (cf.  Ranjit, Bankole, Darroch & Singh, 2001 ).  A 'Hawthorne' effect 
(Brenner, 2002)  is also unlikely because changes in behaviour were reported by only some 
participants .  An alternative explanation , is that the questionnaires (completed three times by 
most ) were responsible for reactivity in participants (French & Sutton, 2010) .  Participants 
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
15 who were exposed to the SE or IOC materials only, showed significant increases in 
anticipated regret which seems  likely related to  questionnaire exposure.  Extant  literature 
report s similar outcome s  (e.g. Judd & Brauer, 1995; Reznick & Schwartz, 2001; Richard et 
al., 1996; Richard et al., 1998; Sheeran & Orbell, 1999) . It is also possible that the effect of 
completing multiple questionnaire measures over three time points subsumed any differential effect the inter vention conditions ma y have had.     
The finding that behavioural change was only evident in sexually active participants 
with relatively low intentions to use contraception highlights the fact that many participants 
had high scores (mean for intention was 6.01 on 7 point scale ) at baseline, making  ceiling 
effects likely and limiting  potential for intervention effect. Thirty -five percent of the sample 
demonstrated inconsistency between reporting very strong intention and consistent contraceptive use however, and as Sheeran, Milne, Webb & Gollwitzer (2005) suggest, for those with stronger intentions, the formation of implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1993) , 
or 'if-then' plans, are likely to be  more successful than motivational interventions at  
influenc ing behavioural change. In addition, interventions may need to consider factors 
beyond the cognitive/planning processes of the individual for behavioural outcome s to 
improve  (e.g. behavioural skil ls including negotiation with sexual partner as proposed by 
Fisher and Fisher,1992; see also Henderson, Wight, Raab, et al., 2007) . 
 
Limitations  
This study has several limitations.  Firstly, although randomisation checks suggested no 
major problems, allocation of  participants did not constitute true randomisation. An 
alternative approach is to cluster randomise, but given the relatively small scale of the current work a nd the need t o accommodate time and facility restrictions  of schools, blinded 
allocation  was deemed a suitable alternative.  This however provides a further limitation in 
that contamination across conditions may have occurred, providing a further potential 
K E Brown et al  
 
 Improving adolescent contraceptive use  
16 explanation for the lack of interaction effect..  This, coupled with a third  limitation, reliance 
on potentially unreliable self -report dat a (Mitchell, Wellings, Elam et al., 2007) , means that 
in rela tion to impact on behavioural c hange, the findings should be considered cautiously.   
Implications of the findings and directions fo r future research  
Despite the se limitations, the  findings provide some support for a theory -driven approach to 
classroom -based sex education. The questionnaires  and intervention materials were based 
around theoretical concepts, and increases in psychologic al antecedents of contraceptive use 
and behaviour for some , were observed .  Future research should therefore continue to 
investigate the utility of theory -driven intervention design with school -based sex education. 
Evidence from the current study also sugg ests that developing volitional and behavioural 
skills interventions for those already motivated may be critical if impacts on sexual health 
outcomes are to b e seen .  Finally , evidence that participants  may have reacted to 
questionnaire measures has receiv ed recent attention with calls for further research to 
understand the reasons for this (French & Sutton, 2010).   Researchers should account for 
such effects in the research design and report them to establish a stronger evidence base.
