Abstract 
Background Stress levels and thus the risk of developing related physical and mental health conditions are rising 
worldwide. Dysfunctional beliefs contribute to the development of stress. Potentially, such beliefs can be modified 
with approach-avoidance modification trainings (AAMT). As previous research indicates that effects of AAMTs are 
small, there is a need for innovative ways of increasing the efficacy of these interventions. For this purpose, we aim 
to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention and study design and explore the efficacy of an innovative emotion-
based AAMT version (eAAMT) that uses the display of emotions to move stress-inducing beliefs away from and draw 
stress-reducing beliefs towards oneself.
Methods We will conduct a parallel randomized controlled pilot study at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität 
Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany. Individuals with elevated stress levels will be randomized to one of eight study condi-
tions (n = 10 per condition) — one of six variants of the eAAMT, an active control intervention (swipe-based AAMT), 
or an inactive control condition. Participants in the intervention groups will engage in four sessions of 20–30 min 
(e)AAMT training on consecutive days. Participants in the inactive control condition will complete the assessments 
via an online tool. Non-blinded assessments will be taken directly before and after the training and 1 week after train-
ing completion. The primary outcome will be perceived stress. Secondary outcomes will be dysfunctional beliefs, 
symptoms of depression, emotion regulation skills, and physiological stress measures. We will compute effect 
sizes and conduct mixed ANOVAs to explore differences in change in outcomes between the eAAMT and control 
conditions.
Discussion The study will provide valuable information to improve the intervention and study design. Moreover, 
if shown to be effective, the approach can be used as an automated smartphone-based intervention. Future research 
needs to identify target groups benefitting from this intervention utilized either as stand-alone treatment or an add-
on intervention that is combined with other evidence-based treatments.Open Access

Background
The World Health Organization has recently referred to 
stress as “the health epidemic of the twenty-first century” 
[1]. Reasons for this assessment included data indicat -
ing that stress has significantly increased during the past 
decades [2] and hence increasingly burdens individuals 
with significant physical (e.g., [3]) and mental (e.g., [4–6]) 
health risks. This also leads to higher direct and indirect 
stress-related costs for societies [7]. On top of this trend, 
the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress burden 
even further for many individuals [8, 9]. Thus, there is a 
need for effective and accessible interventions fostering 
effective stress management.
Ideally, such interventions should be grounded on vali -
dated theories on stress. According to the transactional 
stress model proposed by Lazarus and Folkman [10], 
stress results from a situation that is interpreted as sig -
nificant threat to the attainment of salient goals and from 
a subsequent assessment that appraises presently avail -
able resources as insufficient to cope with the eminent 
threat. Stress is reflected in the activation of physiological 
stress systems. It activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis leading to the release of stress hormones like 
cortisol [11] and the autonomic nervous system which 
results in the release of salivary alpha-amylase [12] as 
well as changes in heart rate variability and breathing rate 
[13, 14]. Moreover, stress is associated with a subjective 
experience of situations to be stressful, also referred to as 
perceived stress [15]. Since the cognitive act of appraising 
both the situation and one’s coping resources is central 
to the emergence of stress, it constitutes an important 
target in interventions aiming to facilitate successful cop -
ing with stress [16, 17]. Such appraisals are influenced by 
objective characteristics of the situation (e.g., controlla -
bility, intensity, duration) as well as by commitments and 
beliefs [10]. For example, if a person believes that they 
must “be perfect, ” they are more likely to appraise a cer -
tain achievement as insufficient. Consequently, they will 
experience stress, as perceived insufficient goal attain -
ment will threaten their self-esteem [18, 19].
Empirically, previous studies found dysfunctional 
beliefs to be related to perceived stress [20] and to mod -
erate the association between stressful events and dys -
phoria/depression [21–24]. Therefore, many stress 
management trainings include interventions that intend 
to invalidate stress-related beliefs (e.g., “If I am not good at what I do, I am not a worthy person”) while promoting 
beliefs likely to reduce stress (e.g., “My value as a person 
does not depend on work-related achievements, ” e.g., [25, 
26]).
In common face-to-face stress management trainings, 
stress-related beliefs are usually targeted with cognitive 
restructuring, where the therapist guides participants 
to the insight that stress-related beliefs are neither valid 
nor healthy and helps them to complement or replace 
the beliefs with more valid and healthier ones [27]. As 
this approach is very much personalized, it requires 
direct interaction with a well-trained therapist. Thus, it 
is comparatively expensive and very difficult to integrate 
in easy-to-disseminate computerized interventions. This 
is problematic insofar as computerized interventions 
can easily be delivered through the Internet at relatively 
low prices and, hence, hold strong potential for improv -
ing healthcare services worldwide. Similar to face-to-face 
trainings, current online-based stress management train -
ings introduce participants to the stress model [10] and 
provide exercises to modify stress-related beliefs (e.g., 
[28–31]), the difference being that they are conducted 
without the support of a therapist. One disadvantage of 
this kind of digital self-help is that it requires more self-
motivation and self-management skills than available to 
many individuals suffering from high stress burden. In 
addition, this approach sorely lacks reinforcing experi -
ences which in face-to-face-treatment are provided by 
the therapists. This, in our clinical experience, often leads 
to underutilization of the intervention. For this reason, 
there is a need for ways of digitally delivering cognitive 
stress management techniques in a more engaging, more 
gamified way.
Theoretically, such a new approach can be based on 
cognitive bias modification (CBM). CBM interventions 
are techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy aiming to 
change cognitive biases in mental disorders on the level 
of automatic processing [32]. The approach-avoidance 
modification training (AAMT), for example, systemati -
cally targets approach-avoidance biases typically found 
in various mental disorders [33], thereby changing the 
evaluation of and behavioral reactions to disorder-spe -
cific stimuli. AAMTs are based on the assumption that 
repeatedly approaching or avoiding a stimulus influ -
ences its affective evaluation [34]. That is, avoiding a 
stimulus leads to a more negative and approaching one Trial registration The trial has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer 
Studien; DRKS0 00230 07; September 7, 2020).

to a more positive evaluation. According to van Dessel 
and colleagues’ inferential account [35], these findings 
can be explained by a (nonconscious) inferential pro -
cess where the evaluation of a certain action is trans -
ferred to the stimulus it relates to. Hence, if a certain 
action is “coded” as positive, the stimulus this action 
refers to will be evaluated as positive, which in turn will 
facilitate approach behavior towards this stimulus in 
the future (e.g., “I find myself approaching this stimulus 
repeatedly, so it must be positive (and shall therefore be 
approached in the future)”).
Originally developed in the field of anxiety [36], the 
standard AAMT is administered on a computer. Par -
ticipants are instructed to respond to a certain stimu -
lus by pushing or pulling a joystick. In addition to the 
physical approach/avoidance movements, a virtual 
distance change is implemented: pulling the joystick 
enlarges the stimulus to simulate approach while push -
ing it shrinks the stimulus to simulate avoidance. Vari -
ants of this method include using mouse movements 
(e.g., [37]) or moving a manikin towards or away from 
a stimulus through key presses (e.g., [38]). Recent tech -
nological developments allow an adaptation of the par -
adigm for use on the smartphone, where participants 
are asked to swipe the stimuli on a touchscreen instead 
of using a joystick [39], greatly facilitating the dissemi -
nation of the intervention compared to desktop-based 
AAMTs (e.g., [40, 41]).
Several studies applied AAMTs as a(n adjunctive) 
treatment for mental health problems. By far, the most 
have been conducted in the field of substance-related 
disorders. In alcohol use disorder, AAMTs reduced 
both approach biases towards substance-related stim -
uli (d  = 0.51) and relapse rates (d  = 0.61; e.g., [42– 44]). 
Evidence is less clear in nicotine use disorder, anxi -
ety disorders, and eating disorders [33]. Some studies 
did find effects on approach-avoidance biases and/or 
symptomatology (e.g., [45– 47]), such as approach bias 
reduction towards food stimuli in bulimic eating dis -
order psychopathology (d  = 0.73), an increase of social 
approach behavior in individuals with social anxiety 
(d = 0.79), and a reduction of cigarette consumption 
(d = 0.35), and dependence (d  = 0.41), whereas other 
studies did not (e.g., [48– 50]). Similarly, an approach 
training towards positive stimuli did not affect mood 
in dysphoric individuals [51], whereas studies that 
combined a short counselling session with an AAMT 
targeting depressogenic beliefs have been shown to sig -
nificantly reduce depressive symptoms (d  = 1.02) [41]. 
Similar combinations of short counselling sessions and 
subsequent AAMT proved to be effective in the treat -
ment of body dissatisfaction [40], procrastination [52], 
and alexithymia [53].Despite these encouraging findings, there are only two 
studies employing an AAMT in the stress context. Here, 
Ferrari and colleagues [54] investigated the effects of an 
AAMT on stress reactivity to a stress-eliciting task. In 
the AAMT, participants trained to approach positive 
pictures and/or avoid negative pictures originating from 
the International Affective Picture System [55]. Although 
approaching positive pictures and avoiding negative pic -
tures did increase approach tendencies towards positive 
pictures, there were no effects on physiological stress 
measures or perceived stress. Becker and colleagues [51], 
on the other hand, found reduced stress reactivity in dys -
phoric individuals after approaching positive and avoid -
ing negative pictures.
As outlined above, AAMTs have been investigated as 
promising treatments for various forms of psychopathol -
ogy, with, albeit, much room for further improving their 
efficacy in particular when used as standalone interven -
tions. Most prominently, based on the inferential account 
[35], it can be argued that the finger or wrist movements 
performed in previous AAMTs do not represent valence 
with the necessary clarity/intensity. Thus, the efficacy of 
AAMTs might be increased by utilizing responses that 
clearly represent salient desired or undesired states. 
Such responses should carry strong positive or negative 
valence, which will, arguably, be transferred to the stimuli 
used in the AAMT and, consequently, foster approach or 
avoidance, respectively.
Emotions constitute an auspicious candidate for such 
responses. Emotions can be conceptualized as com -
plex information processing schemes [56] that are cued 
whenever emotion-specific patterns are detected in the 
information provided directly from sensory input (i.e., 
“fast path” towards emotion elicitation) and/or the cog -
nitive subsystems processing this input (i.e., “slow path” 
towards emotion elicitation). When cued, emotions 
initiate a coordinated set of cognitive, somatic, moti -
vational, and behavioral responses aiming to minimize 
perceived discrepancies between desired and perceived 
states [57]. As undesired (i.e., “negative”) emotions usu -
ally imply that the present state is unsatisfactory and as 
all desired (i.e., “positive”) emotions usually imply that 
the present state is satisfactory, emotions carry strong 
valence signals. Thus, it can be hypothesized that mov -
ing AAMT stimuli with the help of emotional responses 
will transfer stronger positive and negative valence to the 
respective stimuli than with mere finger or wrist move -
ments. Therefore, an emotion-based AAMT (eAAMT) 
should have stronger effects on behavior than the stand -
ard swipe AAMT. While there are several emotions with 
a negative (i.e., anxiety, anger, sadness, and disgust) or 
positive valence [58], these emotions differ in the specific 
appraisal they elicit and the behavioral tendencies they 
Page 4 of 15 Keinert et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:155 
cue [59], which will be inferred to the respective stimu -
lus. Hence, they might differ in their effectiveness when 
used within an eAAMT.
In line with embodiment and facial feedback theories 
[60], we assume that the mere display of emotions (in the 
sense of play-acting) in different modalities might suf -
fice to cue such an emotional response. There is evidence 
that purposefully displaying facial, gestural, and verbal 
expressions of emotions can elicit emotional responses. 
For example, in a recent meta-analysis, Coles and col -
leagues [61] found, albeit small, effects of emotional 
facial expressions on emotional experience. Other studies 
found similar effects for emotional expressions in body 
and voice (e.g., [62–65]). But even if a person does not 
consciously experience the respective emotion, its display 
will likely carry a significantly stronger positive or nega -
tive valence than the simple finger or hand movements 
performed in swipe or joystick AAMTs.
To investigate these assumptions, we developed an 
eAAMT in which participants display positively and neg -
atively valenced emotions to approach or avoid stimuli. 
Given the importance of stress-related problems and the 
lack of studies on AAMT-based interventions against 
stress, our eAAMT targets stress. As stress-related 
beliefs play an important role in its emergence, stimuli 
will consist of statements representing stress-reducing 
and stress-enhancing beliefs. Because of the need for 
accessible and easy-to-disseminate interventions against 
stress, we developed the eAAMT as a (guided) smart -
phone-based intervention.
Purpose of the study
Before conducting a large RCT on the eAAMT, we aim to 
test intervention and study procedures and estimate pre -
liminary effect sizes on clinical outcomes. For this pur -
pose, we will run a pilot study with the following aims: 
(a) evaluate the feasibility of the intervention and study 
design and (b) explore its efficacy in influencing clinical 
outcomes  when compared to an inactive control condi -
tion and a swipe-based AAMT (swipe control condition). 
Additional exploratory questions are whether the specific 
emotions anxiety, anger, sadness, and disgust differ with 
respect to their effectiveness in eAAMTs and whether 
deviating from the common 50:50 ratio of approach vs. 
avoidance responses (e.g., [35, 47]) in favor of a 1:4 bias 
towards approach responses would lead to stronger 
effects on the reduction of perceived stress.
Methods
Design
We will conduct a parallel eight-armed randomized con -
trolled pilot study (see Fig.  1 for the study flow and sup -
plemental materials for the spirit checklist of the trial). The study will be conducted at the Department of Clini -
cal Psychology and Psychotherapy of the Friedrich-Alex -
ander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. In the eAAMT 
and swipe control groups, participants will receive four 
sessions à 20–30  min of training on four consecutive 
days, while the inactive control group will not receive any 
training. Participants will be randomly assigned to one 
of the eight study groups with a 1:1 allocation. A post -
doctoral researcher not otherwise involved in the study 
will generate a randomization list using random numbers 
in Microsoft Excel. A block randomization will be per -
formed with a block size of eight. The study is registered 
in the German Clinical Trials Register (Deutsches Regis -
ter Klinischer Studien; DRKS00023007).
Participants
Inclusion criteria for participation in the pilot study 
will be the following: (1) heightened levels of perceived 
stress as indicated by a score of 19 or above on the Per -
ceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10; German version: [66]), 
(2) at least 18  years of age, and (3) ability and willing -
ness to provide informed consent. Following procedures 
suggested by Heber and colleagues [67], the PSS cut-off  
score is set at one standard deviation above the PSS mean 
score in the validation study of the German version of the 
PSS-10 [66]. Exclusion criteria will be as follows: (1) the 
presence of a severe psychological condition (i.e., psycho -
sis; based on self-report), (2) physical conditions impair -
ing the expression of emotion (e.g., facial paralysis), (3) 
heavy smoking (i.e., more than 10 cigarettes/day due to 
possible confounding influences on cortisol measures), 
and (4) suicidal ideation. We expect a medium to large 
effect size based on previous smartphone-based AAMT 
studies (e.g., [52, 53]). Therefore, we will include n = 10 
participants per study group (i.e., N = 80 in total) as sug -
gested by Bell and colleagues [68] for pilot studies with 
expected medium to large effect sizes. To complete the 
intervention per protocol, participants should attend at 
least three of the four training sessions. To ensure even 
distribution of subsample sizes across study conditions, 
we will change randomization block size in case of treat -
ment dropouts. Number of and reasons for dropping out 
will be recorded and reported for each condition.
Interventions
Experimental interventions
The experimental interventions will consist of six varia -
tions of the eAAMT (see below for details) delivered by 
a smartphone app. We decided to include these varia -
tions to be able to compare the utility of different nega -
tive emotions (i.e., anger, anxiety, disgust, and sadness) 
as avoidance responses. Moreover, we want to investigate 
whether the ratio of approach to avoidance responses has 
Page 5 of 15
 Keinert et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:155 
 
an influence on the effects of the training. Therefore, we 
will include one training condition using a ratio of 4:1 of 
approach vs. avoidance responses. The intervention aims 
to reduce perceived stress by modifying stress-related 
beliefs; therefore, the AAMT stimuli will consist of state -
ments representing dysfunctional (e.g., “If I fail partly, it 
is as bad as a complete failure”) and functional (e.g., “I am 
allowed to make mistakes”) beliefs.
The pool of 78 statements in total (30 stress-enhanc -
ing and 48 stress-reducing beliefs — for the eAAMT-
unpleasant emotions 1:4 condition, more stress-reducing 
beliefs are needed; see below) will consist of items from 
the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) [69] comple -
mented by items proposed by a team of three experts 
in the development of stress management interventions 
(the senior author and two licensed psychotherapists and 
stress experts working in our group). To make the inter -
vention more appealing, the statements will be presented 
on the screen with pictures relating to the statements 
(see Fig. 2 for examples).The study sessions will be held in a lab at the Depart -
ment of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the 
Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. 
Each participant will participate in four 20–30-min train -
ing sessions on consecutive days. Participants will be 
provided with a smartphone for the training. The ses -
sions will be conducted by undergraduate and graduate 
students (experimenters) who will be trained and super -
vised by a postdoctoral researcher. In addition, they 
will be guided by a manual outlining the procedure and 
instructions of the experiment.
The experimenters will explain the aim of the training 
and its implementation. In addition, the app will provide 
participants with short written instructions for the train -
ing which will be complemented with short video clips. 
Each training session will consist of 60 trials where the 
stimuli are presented in random order. With the excep -
tion of one condition (see below), the approach-avoid -
ance response ratio will be 50:50. Upon presentation of 
a stimulus, participants will decide whether they should

and anger) are used to avoid dysfunctional beliefs. The approach-avoidance response ratio is 1:1. bAll unpleasant emotions are used to avoid

pull the respective belief towards themselves or push it 
away (i.e., whether it is stress enhancing or stress reduc -
ing). Participants will draw stress-reducing beliefs 
towards themselves by displaying one of twelve positive 
emotions. The training sessions will be divided into three 
blocks (20 trials each) with participants being instructed 
to change the emotional response after each block. The 
emotions will always be displayed in the same order (day 
1: joy, relaxation, and love; day 2: excitement, tranquil -
ity, and gratitude; day 3: happiness, resolve, and content; 
day 4: courage, confidence, and pride). Stress-enhancing 
beliefs will be pushed away by displaying different nega -
tive emotions, namely anxiety, anger, disgust, and sad -
ness. The instructive video clips will show an actor who 
carries out the display of each emotion. The video clips 
will address the following four components: (1) facial 
expression of the emotion, (2) a verbal statement con -
sistent with the emotion, (3) the intonation of the ver -
bal statement, and (4) a body gesture consistent with 
the emotion. When the correct emotion is displayed, 
the stimuli will either zoom in (approach) or out (avoid -
ance), and a thumbs-up picture will be presented on the 
smartphone screen to systematically reinforce possible 
effects of the training. When the stimulus is not pro -
cessed correctly, the sentence “Unfortunately, this was 
the wrong emotion” will appear on the screen. Figure  2 
shows an exemplary trial flow. In all eAAMT conditions, 
an investigator will observe participants’ emotion display 
through a live stream of a video camera from behind a 
partition wall and remote control the app with a tablet. Smartphone and tablet are connected using Google’s 
Nearby Application Programming Interface (https:// 
devel opers. google. com/ nearby/), which automatically 
establishes either a Bluetooth or a Wi-Fi connection 
between the two devices.
The six variations of the eAAMT are described in the 
following:
• eAAMT anxiety: In the eAAMT-anxiety condition, 
participants will be asked to push stress-enhancing 
beliefs away from themselves by displaying anxiety. 
Anxiety conveys the information that a stimulus is 
dangerous and cues avoidance tendencies [57, 70]. 
It might thus be helpful in increasing the avoidance 
motivation towards stress-enhancing beliefs. As 
instructed by the actor shown in the introductory 
video, participants are asked to express anxiety by 
a fearful facial expression and heavy breathing, by 
withdrawing the body, and saying “It is dangerous to 
think like that, I will protect myself from that!” .
• eAAMT anger: In the eAAMT-anger condition, par -
ticipants will be asked to push stress-enhancing 
beliefs away from themselves by displaying anger. 
Anger is activated when someone or something is 
hindering a person to attain a personally relevant 
goal and when apologetic circumstances are not seen 
[57]. While anxiety cues avoidance tendencies, anger 
facilitates fighting for one’s goals [57]. Participants 
are instructed to display anger by an angry facial 
expression, a threatening clench of the fist, hitting 
Fig. 2 Exemplary trial flow

 Keinert et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:155 
 
the table, and saying “Such a stupid belief, I will not 
listen to its advice!” .
• eAAMT disgust: In the eAAMT-disgust condition, 
participants will be asked to push stress-enhancing 
beliefs away from themselves by displaying disgust. 
The evolutionary function of disgust was to detect 
contaminated/poisonous food or disease threat [71]. 
Therefore, it triggers strong aversion and is associ -
ated with avoidance tendencies [58, 70]. Disgust will 
be expressed by a disgusted facial expression, turning 
away one’s head, and saying “Ugh, this is disgusting, I 
will stay away from that!” .
• eAAMT sadness: In the eAAMT-sadness condition, 
participants will be asked to push stress-enhancing 
beliefs away from themselves by displaying sadness. 
Sadness provides the information that current goals 
are not attainable and cues a letting go of these goals, 
which eventually facilitates committing to other 
(more attainable) goals [57]. When used within the 
eAAMT, sadness might help participants to regret 
that they have developed dysfunctional beliefs and let 
go of them. Participants are instructed to display sad -
ness by a sad facial expression and deep breath, tilt -
ing the head forward, and saying “I will let go of this 
belief!” .
Furthermore, two conditions will be implemented 
to allow studying the role of the approach-avoidance-
response ratio.
• eAAMT-unpleasant emotions 1:1: In the eAAMT-
unpleasant emotions 1:1 condition, participants will 
display a different unpleasant emotion to push stress-
enhancing beliefs away from themselves in each 
training session (anxiety, anger, sadness, and disgust). 
The order in which the four negative emotions is dis -
played will be randomized.
• eAAMT-unpleasant emotions 1:4: In the eAAMT-
unpleasant emotions 1:4 condition, participants will 
also display a different unpleasant emotion in each 
training session (anxiety, anger, sadness, and disgust). 
However, there will be a response bias of 1:4 towards 
approach responses (i.e., on average for each dys -
functional belief, four functional beliefs are presented 
to strengthen the focus on resources such as func -
tional beliefs and positive emotions).
Control interventions
• Swipe control condition: In the swipe control con -
dition, participants will use the same app as in the 
experimental conditions. Here, the app will also pro -vide participants with written instructions but with -
out showing video clips. To approach and avoid the 
stimuli, participants will be asked to swipe stress-
enhancing beliefs away from themselves and stress-
reducing beliefs towards themselves on the smart -
phone screen. After swiping, the app will provide a 
respective zoom feedback and present a thumbs-up 
picture (see description of the experimental condi -
tions). In the swipe control condition, the app will not 
be controlled by an experimenter. The participants 
will still be observed with an external video camera 
during the training to keep the conditions between 
experimental and control intervention equal.
• Inactive control condition: Participants randomized 
to the inactive control condition will not be invited 
to the lab and receive any training. They will receive 
links to the study questionnaires via email and fill 
them out by themselves.
Measures
Table 1 gives an overview of all measures taken.
Feasibility outcomes
With regard to feasibility, we aim to evaluate both the 
feasibility of the intervention and the possibility of a trial 
evaluating the efficacy of the intervention.
Feasibility of the intervention Utilizing methods pro -
posed in the context of process evaluation (e.g., Medical 
Research Council framework [72]), we will evaluate tech -
nical problems, adherence, usability, and acceptability. 
Technical problems will be evaluated by testing whether 
the proportion of incomplete usages of the intervention 
due to technical problems is above the a priori set criteria 
of 95%. Adherence will be evaluated by testing whether 
the proportion of participants completing the interven -
tion as instructed is above the a priori set criteria of 50%. 
Usability of the intervention will be assessed with five 
self-constructed items rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0 
to 5). They assess the following aspects of the interven -
tion: comprehensibility of the instructions, viability of 
emotion expression at the beginning and end of the train -
ing, and degree of avoidance of stress-enhancing beliefs 
and degree of approach towards stress-reducing beliefs 
with the help of the intervention. In addition, the System 
Usability Scale (SUS) [73] will be administered in a sub -
set of participants to assess the usability of the AAMT 
app. The scale consists of ten items measuring the global 
usability of technological systems on a 5-point Likert 
scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree; exem -

ten items, summing them up and multiplying the sum 
by 2.5. The result is a score ranging from 0 to 100 with 
a higher score indicating better usability. Two additional 
items assess the general satisfaction with the app (1) on a 
7-point Likert scale from not at all satisfying to exceed -
ingly satisfying and (2) with school grades. The SUS is a 
reliable (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.91) and widely applicable 
measure [74]. Acceptability will be assessed with two 
self-constructed items. These items will be rated on a 
6-point Likert scale (0 to 5). Participants will be asked to 
rate the helpfulness of the training for the modification 
of stress-related beliefs and whether they would recom -
mend the training to a friend. The items will be analyzed 
separately. Additionally, participants will be asked in an 
open-ended format what they have learned from the 
training and whether they have general comments or 
recommendations.Feasibility of the study design We will collect informa -
tion on the number of eligible participants and the per -
centage willing to participate in the study. Moreover, we 
will report the number of complete follow-up assess -
ments and consider the study as feasible if at least 75% of 
the assessments will be completed.
Clinical outcomes
Primary outcome is the change in perceived stress level 
assessed by the German 10-item version of the PSS [66]. 
The PSS-10 assesses the unpredictability of, uncontrol -
lability of, and state of being overwhelmed by daily life 
during the past week (exemplary item: “In the last week, 
how often have you been upset because of something 
that happened unexpectedly?”). The ten items are rated 
on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never to 4 = very often). The 
ten items are summed up to receive a total score ranging Table 1 Overview of measures per timepoint

between 0 and 40 with a higher total score representing 
a higher level of perceived stress. The PSS-10 has shown 
good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84) and validity 
[66].
Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression, 
emotion regulation skills, current stress level, stress-
related (dys-)functional beliefs, emotional state, perfor -
mance measures, and physiological stress measures.
Symptoms of depression will be assessed with the Ger -
man version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D; German version: [75]). The 
CES-D is a 20-item self-report questionnaire assessing 
the frequency of symptoms of depression in the general 
population during the last 7  days on a 4-point Likert 
scale (0 = some of the time to 3 = most of the time). The 
total score computed as the sum of all items can range 
between 0 and 60. Total scores higher than 22 are con -
sidered to indicate a clinically relevant depressive symp -
tom severity [75]. The CES-D has shown good reliability 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89–0.92) and validity in non-clini -
cally depressed samples [76, 77].
Emotion regulation skills will be assessed with the Pro -
longed-State-Version of the Emotion Regulation Skills 
Questionnaire (ERSQ; German version: [78]). The self-
report questionnaire measures the successful application 
of nine emotion regulation skills during the past week: 
awareness (e.g., “I paid attention to my feelings”), sensa -
tions (e.g., “My physical sensations were a good indica -
tion of how I was feeling”), clarity  (e.g., “I was clear about 
what emotions I was experiencing”), understanding (e.g., 
“I was aware of why I felt the way I felt”), modification 
(e.g., “I was able to influence my negative feelings”), 
acceptance (e.g., “I accepted my emotions”), tolerance 
(e.g., “I felt I could tolerate my negative feelings”), readi -
ness to confront distressing situations (e.g., “I did what I 
had planned, even if it made me feel uncomfortable or 
anxious”), and self-support (e.g., “I supported myself in 
emotionally distressing situations”). The 27 items are 
rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all to 4 = almost 
always). In addition to the subscales assessing the spe -
cific emotion regulation skills, a general indicator of 
emotion regulation ability can be computed as the aver -
age score across all items (range = 0 to 4) with a higher 
score indicating higher emotion regulation skills. A num -
ber of studies demonstrated acceptable to good reliability 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89–0.97) and validity of the ques -
tionnaire (e.g., [78–84]).
The current stress level  will be assessed before each 
training session with a self-constructed short stress 
measure consisting of two items rated on an 11-point 
Likert scale (0 = not at all to 10 = very much): “Please 
indicate how stressed you feel at the moment” and “Please indicate how well you can cope with the stress at 
the moment. ” The items will be analyzed separately.
To assess stress-related (dys-)functional beliefs, a total 
of ten items were selected from Rojas and colleagues’ [69] 
short version of the DAS. The DAS was developed as a 
self-report instrument to assess dysfunctional attitudes 
that are typically found in depressive patients. The ten 
items with the best fit for the stress context of the current 
study were selected by an expert group under supervi -
sion of MB: nine statements consisting of dysfunctional 
attitudes and one of a functional attitude. Then, two ver -
sions of the scale were created. The first version assesses 
the agreement with the ten DAS items on a 7-point Lik -
ert scale (DAS-A; 1 = fully disagree  to 7 = fully agree ) 
and the second version the perceived helpfulness of the 
beliefs (DAS-H; 1 = not at all helpful to 7 = very help -
ful). To obtain a total score, the functional-belief item is 
reversely coded, and the ten items are summed up. The 
total score in both versions ranges between 10 and 70. A 
higher score in the DAS-A represents higher agreement 
with dysfunctional stress-related beliefs, and a higher 
score in the DAS-H represents a higher helpfulness rat -
ing of dysfunctional beliefs.
To assess the  emotional state, i.e., the intensity of emo -
tions experienced during the last week, a team of experts 
in the assessment and regulation of emotions extended 
the German version of the Positive and Negative Affect 
Schedule [85] in a way that the following affective states 
are all assessed with one item: courage, gratitude, joy, 
pride, excitement, resolve, anger, anxiety, sadness, con -
fidence, disgust, tranquility, love, happiness, relaxation, 
and content. Each item starts with the instruction “Dur -
ing the last week, I felt… ” and invites participants to rate 
the intensity of the respective emotion during the past 
week on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all 
to 4 = very much. The items will be analyzed separately.
Performance measures
The quality of participants’ emotion expression will be 
evaluated by the present investigator after each display 
of an emotion. The display in face, voice, and body will 
be rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = no expression of 
the respective emotion to 5 = very strong expression of the 
respective emotion). Moreover, participants will be asked 
to self-rate the felt intensity of the respective emotion 
after each stimulus on a visual analog scale presented on 
the smartphone (0 = not at all to 100 = very much). The 
smartphone app will also record the percentage of incor -
rect responses (expressing the wrong emotion in the 
eAAMT or swiping in the wrong direction in the swipe-
based AAMT) as well as task completion time for all 
responses.

Physiological stress measures
To gain additional insights into the effects of the train -
ing on physiological stress systems, we will assess the 
concentration of hormonal stress markers as well as heart 
activity and respiration. Saliva samples for the assess -
ment of cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase will be taken 
at the first and last training session before the training.
We will use Salivettes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) 
to collect the samples. The saliva samples will be analyzed 
at the Department of Health Psychology of the Friedrich-
Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.
Heart activity and respiration will be recorded for 
3.5  min in a subset of participants on day 1 and day 4 
before and after the training. For this purpose, we will 
use a highly sensitive radar system, allowing for a con -
tactless monitoring of the parameters of interest. For 
more details on the method, see [86]. Previous stud -
ies demonstrated the radar system to be a reliable and 
valid method for assessing heart activity and respiration 
in healthy individuals [87, 88]. We will be able to derive 
information on heart rate variability and breathing rate 
from these measurements.
Demographic information
We will also collect demographic data of the participants. 
Demographic data will include gender, age, education, 
current occupation, studies (degree, subject, semester), 
relationship status, psychotherapy (former and current), 
smoking, and medication.
Procedures
Participants will be recruited via postings in social net -
works, the email newsletters of the Friedrich-Alexander-
Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, and flyers posted on 
notice boards in public places in Erlangen. The recruit -
ment posts will provide interested individuals with a QR 
code and a link to the web site Unipark [89] where they 
will be informed about the study and will be given the 
opportunity to provide consent for participating in the 
first assessment. In case of informed consent, partici -
pants will be forwarded to the assessment of the inclu -
sion and exclusion criteria. Individuals suitable for study 
inclusion will be randomized to one of the eight study 
conditions by the experimenters according to the rand -
omization list. Neither participants nor experimenters 
will be blinded to the assignment.
During the training, the smartphone will record par -
ticipants’ display of emotions with the integrated front 
camera. The recordings will be used as training material 
to train algorithms in automated emotion recognition 
(conducted in cooperation with the Chair of Embedded 
Intelligence for Healthcare and Wellbeing at the Uni -
versity of Augsburg and the Machine Learning and Data Analytics Lab at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität 
Erlangen-Nürnberg). We will also record participants’ 
emotional expression with an external video camera and 
microphone. All of the video and sound recordings will 
only be used for training the algorithms and not be ana -
lyzed otherwise.
The clinical outcomes will be assessed at three time 
points via the web-based assessment tool Unipark [89]: 
directly before the training (T1), directly after the train -
ing (T2), and 1 week after training completion (T3). Fea -
sibility outcomes will be assessed at T2. Additionally, 
participants in the intervention and swipe control groups 
will receive short daily questionnaires in paper–pencil 
format. Participants who do not fill out the T3 assess -
ment will be reminded twice via email. In addition, par -
ticipants who discontinue the intervention will be asked 
to answer the assessments anyway. Participants will be 
offered the opportunity to receive information about the 
results of the study via email.
Participants studying psychology will receive course 
credits for participation. Additionally, all participants 
enrolled in the study until May 2021 will have the chance 
of winning 500 € in a draw. From June 2021 onwards, 
participants will be offered an expense allowance of 20 
€ with psychology students having the choice between 
course credits and financial reimbursement. We under -
took this change in procedure to compensate for COVID-
19 associated problems with the recruitment.
Ethical aspects
The study will be conducted following the Declaration 
of Helsinki and was approved by the German Psycho -
logical Society’s ethics committee (BerkingMatthias2020-
09-10AM). All modifications of the study protocol will be 
amended at the ethics committee and documented in the 
trial register.
In the online screening questionnaire, we will collect 
demographic information (see above) as well as partici -
pant’s email addresses to be able to inform them about 
further proceedings in the study. Moreover, the online-
platform Unipark logs IP addresses, date, time and 
content of the request, and device information (e.g., oper -
ating system and version, app version). Concerning data 
privacy, the platform Unipark complies with the Euro -
pean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation [90]. 
After the online screening, each participant will receive 
an ID number, and any identifying information (i.e., 
email address, name on the consent form) will be stored 
separately from the data collected in the study. A list in 
hard copy joining ID numbers and email addresses will 
only be accessible to the principal investigator. All data 
collected in the study (i.e., questionnaire, physiological, 
and smartphone data, video and sound recordings) will 
Page 11 of 15
 Keinert et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:155 
 
be stored on an external disk only accessible for persons 
directly involved in the study. The final data set including 
questionnaire, physiological, and smartphone data will 
be anonymized and made available in the Open Science 
Framework.
Statistical analysis plan
Before conducting the analyses, we will test the precon -
ditions and in case of violations use alternative methods. 
The level of significance will be set to α = 0.05. We will 
report p-values for all analyses.
Feasibility outcomes will be analyzed with descrip -
tive statistics and independent t-tests to compare the 
results of the eAAMT conditions with the swipe control 
condition. To gain insight into the differences in clinical 
outcome measures between study conditions, we will 
compute pre-post effect sizes. In addition, we will con -
duct exploratory analyses using two-way mixed analyses 
of variance (ANOVAs) with treatment as between-sub -
jects factor and time as within-subjects factor. Because 
omnibus tests fail to detect differences between single 
conditions if the majority of conditions do not differ, we 
plan to run pairwise comparisons comparing the sin -
gle eAAMT conditions with the inactive control condi -
tion and the swipe control condition. In order to prevent 
alpha-error accumulation, we will first compare the 
eAAMT conditions to the inactive control condition. 
Only if the interaction effect in this comparison will be 
significant, we will also compare the eAAMT conditions 
to the swipe control condition. Moreover, as this is a pilot 
trial and we aim to evaluate if the training is effective in 
itself, we will conduct per protocol analyses. We will also 
run intention-to-treat analyses to determine the robust -
ness of the results when considering missing data. All 
analyses will be conducted in R [91] and SPSS.
Discussion
In this pilot study, we will evaluate the feasibility and 
explore the efficacy of a novel, emotion-based AAMT 
targeting stress-related beliefs in individuals with ele -
vated perceived stress. Due to their important role in 
the emergence of perceived stress [20], stress-related 
beliefs are a promising starting point for interventions 
against stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
that employs an AAMT with stress-related beliefs as 
stimuli, thus targeting a construct directly implicated in 
the process of stress generation. Prior AAMT studies in 
the stress context that used emotional pictures as stimu -
lus material mostly failed to find effects on stress meas -
ures [51, 54]. This demonstrates the need for a new way 
of designing AAMT interventions against stress, which 
our study addresses. Another novelty of our intervention 
is the use of emotions as approach/avoidance responses within an AAMT. Based on assumptions of the inferen -
tial account [35], we hypothesize that displaying highly 
valenced emotional responses within an AAMT will 
enhance the effects of currently performed AAMTs 
and be more effective in modifying approach-avoidance 
biases as well as reducing the particular psychopathology 
associated with such biases. In addition to their strong 
valence, the specific appraisals and behavioral tenden -
cies associated with emotions [59] might be transferred 
to AAMT stimuli, thereby changing their evaluation in a 
more complex way. Therefore, in our study, participants 
will display emotional responses to push stress-related 
beliefs away from themselves and pull stress-reducing 
beliefs towards themselves. In order to provide an acces -
sible and easy-to-disseminate training, we developed 
the eAAMT as app-based intervention. Since this is a 
completely new intervention, we decided to conduct 
a pilot study in preparation for a larger RCT. With the 
help of the feasibility evaluation, we will be able to gain 
insights into how the eAAMT can be implemented and 
is received by users. Moreover, we will be able to use 
the information on the feasibility of our study design to 
make further adaptations before the start of the RCT. By 
exploring the efficacy of the eAAMT, we will gain pre -
liminary insights into its effects on clinical outcomes 
and, hence, therapeutic potential. We hypothesize that 
the eAAMT will be more effective in reducing perceived 
stress as well as the extent of agreement with dysfunc -
tional beliefs and symptoms of depression than a swipe-
based AAMT. In addition to exploring this hypothesis, 
we will explore whether the display of the emotions anxi -
ety, anger, sadness, or disgust will be particularly effective 
and whether a bias towards approach responses within 
the eAAMT increases its efficacy. When we developed 
the protocol, we decided to use an inactive control condi -
tion as one of the comparators. This allows us to answer 
the question whether the eAAMT is helpful at all. As sec -
ond comparator, we chose to use the swipe-based AAMT 
which is currently the most common AAMT variant on 
the smartphone [39–41, 52, 53]. The comparison with 
a swipe-based AAMT allows us to investigate whether 
the use of emotions in the AAMT provides additional 
benefit.
The current study has several limitations. First, we 
will use standardized stress-related beliefs that may 
not be relevant for every participant. However, we 
aim to develop an app that can be disseminated on a 
large scale and used by everyone and thus decided to 
standardize the material. Second, the eAAMT will be 
performed as a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm [92] in which 
the investigator assesses the emotional response as 
long as the algorithms are not able to do this (how -
ever, in contrast to a real Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, 
Page 12 of 15 Keinert et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:155 
participants are informed that the investigator assesses 
the emotional response). The presence of an inves -
tigator, however, might have an impact on partici -
pants’ performance [93], especially if they are socially 
anxious, and therefore influence the efficacy of the 
app in reducing perceived stress. Thus, future studies 
should compare the efficacy of an investigator-based 
eAAMT with the automated version of the interven -
tion. Third, our target sample size is very small. It is 
sufficient, however, to test the feasibility of the inter -
vention and study design and explore its therapeu -
tic potential. If the results of the intended study are 
promising, future studies should investigate its effi -
cacy in a bigger sample. Fourth, we will not be able to 
draw conclusions about the long-term efficacy of the 
intervention. Thus, in case of evidence for short-term 
effects, future studies should include long-term fol -
low-up assessments. Fifth, the compensation for study 
participation is not equal over the course of the study. 
Psychology students receive course credit at all times. 
Non-psychology students, on the other hand, did not 
receive compensation at the beginning of the study, 
but it was introduced during the course of the study. 
The presence of a compensation might reduce intrinsic 
motivation to participate in the intervention and thus 
affect the outcomes. However, we believe that course 
credit or a compensation of 20 €  is not enough to be 
the only source of motivation to participate in such a 
study. Nevertheless, future studies should keep com -
pensation equal. Finally, recruitment of the pilot trial 
already had started by the time this study protocol was 
written. This is not in line with good scientific prac -
tice which requires the publishing of study protocols 
before the start of the trial to increase transparency. 
However, to ensure transparency, this pilot study has 
been preregistered. We decided to additionally publish 
the study protocol because it allows us to describe the 
complex design and novel intervention in more detail.
All these limitations aside, if shown to be effective, 
the eAAMT has great potential to improve healthcare 
as it is an easy-to-deliver and engaging intervention. 
Moreover, approach-avoidance biases are implicated 
in many mental disorders [33]. Hence, increasing the 
efficacy of currently employed interventions might 
improve treatment in various domains of psychopa -
thology. In addition, if, as endeavored in our study, 
the emotion recognition is automated with the help of 
machine learning methods and implemented in future 
interventions, such new, innovative approaches open 
up many possibilities to further reduce the burden on 
the healthcare system — important assets in order to 
address “the health epidemic of the twenty-first cen -
tury” [1 ].Trial status
We conducted a preliminary feasibility trial in June and 
July 2020 with N = 16 participants. After minor adapta -
tions to the experimental setting, recruitment for the 
pilot trial started in July 2020 and is currently ongoing.
