Abstract
Background: While it is recommended that childcare services implement policies and practices to support obesity
prevention, there remains limited evidence to inform policy and practice. The aim of this study is to examine the
effectiveness of performance review and facilitated feedback in increasing the implementation of healthy eating
and physical activity-promoting policies and practices in childcare services.
Methods: The study was conducted with childcare services in the Hunter New England region of New South
Wales, Australia. Eligible services were randomised to a wait-list control group or to receive the implementation
strategy. The strategy targeted the implementation of written nutrition, physical activity, and small screen recreation
policies; providing information to families regarding healthy eating, physical activity, and small screen time; providing
twice weekly healthy eating learning experiences to chil dren; providing water and plain milk only to children;
providing fundamental movement skills activities for children every day; and limiting the use of electronic
screen time for educational purposes and learning exper iences. Intervention services received a performance
review and facilitated feedback process five times over the 10 months that included an assessment of current
practices, goal setting, identification of barriers to implementation, problem-solving, and resource provision.
The primary outcome was the proportion of services imp lementing all six policies and practices, assessed by
nominated supervisor completion of a computer-assisted telephone interview at baseline and 12-month follow-up.
Results: One hundred and eight services took part. There were no significant differences in the proportion of services
implementing all six practices at 12 month s (mean difference 0.51; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.58; p= 0.24). There were
also no differences between groups in the mean number of policies and practices implemented (mean difference
0.1; 95% CI −0.4 to 0.6; p= 0.71), or the proportion implementing each of the six individual policies and practices at 12
months (OR range 0.57 to 1.85; p>0 . 0 5 ) .

Keywords: Childcare, Implementation, Nutrition, Physical activity, Obesity prevention, Children,
Background
Overweight and obesity established in childhood has
been shown to track into adulthood [ 1] increasing the
future population health burden of the most prevalent
causes of adult mortality and morbidity [ 2,3]. Inad-
equate physical activity and poor nutrition are key risk
factors related to the development of overweight and
obesity [ 4,5]. The early childhood years have been
recognised as a critical time in the development of diet-
ary intake and physical activity behaviours [ 6,7].
The World Health Organization recently identified
centre-based childcare services (including organised
group pre-school early education programs, infant clas-
ses, reception classes, nurseries and long day care) [ 8]a s
an important setting for the delivery of population-based
interventions in order to prevent childhood obesity [ 9].
They have the potential to reach a significant proportion
of the population aged less than five [ 10] and existing in-
frastructure to facilitate, support, and promote child
healthy eating and physical activity. In recognition, gov-
ernments and private organisations both in the United
States (US) and Australia have developed specific recom-
mendations regarding the implementation of service pol-
icies and practices to improve diet and increase physical
activity levels among children attending care [ 11–14].
Such policies and practices have included a written ser-
vice nutrition and physical activity policy, the provision
of nutrition learning experiences to children, provision
of nutrition resources to parents, limiting the provision
of sweetened drinks to children, structured physical ac-
tivity opportunities (e.g. fundamental movement skills
programs), and limiting opportunities for sedentary
screen time (e.g. computer use).
Despite such recommendations, evidence suggests that
healthy eating and physical activity-promoting policies
and practices are not routinely implemented by childcare
services [ 13,15–19]. For example, in the US, studies
have reported that half of services do not provide drink-
ing water in classrooms [ 17], around a quarter serve
juice [ 20], and less than one third have written nutrition
policies regarding food consumed by staff [ 18]. A 2016
study conducted in Canada reported that only 37% of
childcare services provide nutrition education/resources
to parents (on a regular basis) [ 21]. Further, in the US,
research suggests 47 –50% of childcare services do nothave a physical activity policy [ 13,22] and more than a
quarter (28%) do not provide teacher-led physical activ-
ity [23], while in Australia, half of services reported not
having a physical activity policy (41 –48%) and nearly a
third (28 –30%) allow 3- to 5-year-old children non-ac-
tive small screen recreation daily [ 15].
To maximise the public health benefit of obesity pre-
vention interventions delivered in childcare, widespread
implementation of recommended policies and practices
is required. However, evidence to inform interventions is
currently limited [ 24,25]. A recently published
Cochrane review examined the effectiveness of childcare
obesity prevention interventions seeking to improve the
implementation of healthy eating and/or physical activity
policy and practice change and identified just ten such
controlled trials [ 25]. The review concluded that there
was considerable heterogeneity in the implementation
strategies tested which precluded isolation of the impact
of individual strategies and found weak and inconsistent
evidence regarding their effectiveness in improving im-
plementation of obesity prevention policies and practices
in this setting [ 25]. The review identified a need for fur-
ther implementation research in childcare [ 25].
Audit and feedback (also known as performance feed-
back) has long been used to support organisational
change, particularly in clinical settings [ 26]. Performance
review and feedback interventions are defined as those
where an individual ’s professional practice or perform-
ance (usually objectively measured health professional
practice or patient outcomes) is measured over a speci-
fied period of time and compared against professional
standards or targets with the results fed back to the indi-
vidual [ 27]. A Cochrane review including 140 rando-
mised controlled trials (RCTs), primarily conducted in
the outpatient setting to improve prescribing or testing,
concluded that audit and feedback interventions resulted
in improved professional practice and the quality of
health care [ 27]. The findings indicated that following
audit and feedback, desired practice behaviours im-
proved by around 4% on baseline behaviour [ 27]. The
magnitude of the effect of audit and feedback however
appears greater when baseline adherence is low, feed-
back frequency is high, and multiple modes of feedback
occur [ 27]. Additional attractive features of audit and
feedback are its capacity to be routinely delivered usingFinch et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:17 Page 2 of 13
modalities, such as telephone that enable reach to large
numbers of services at relatively low cost, and ability to
address identified implementation barriers such as be-
liefs about capabilities and motivation [ 28]. Compared
with more resource-intensive interventions delivered
under tightly controlled research conditions, the impact
of such interventions that are able to be delivered under
‘real world ’conditions are of particular interest to policy-
makers and practitioners as they are more likely to pro-
vide a better approximation of the effect of intervention
when delivered in the absence of research support and
expertise [ 28]. Audit and feedback therefore presents as
a feasible whole of population approach to supporting
childcare services to implement healthy eating and phys-
ical activity policies and practices. The primary aim of
this study was to examine the effectiveness of a perform-
ance review and facilitated feedback intervention in in-
creasing the implementation of healthy eating and
physical activity-promoting policies and practices in
childcare services.
Methods
Design
The study employed a parallel group randomised con-
trolled trial (RCT) design [ 29]. The trial protocol has
been described in detail previously [ 30]. A sample of eli-
gible childcare services, within the Hunter New England
Region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, was
approached to participate. This implementation trial was
conducted as part of government-funded health promo-
tion services routinely delivered to all childcare services
by a regional population health unit (Hunter New
England Population Health (HNEPH)) [ 31]. The unit is
responsible for supporting the implementation of
healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices
among early childhood education and care services across
the Hunter New England government health region [ 31].
The trial, conducted from August 2013 to December 2014,
was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical
Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000972628) and approved
by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics
Committee (06/07/26/4.04) and the University of Newcas-
tle Human Research Ethics Committee (H-2008-0343).
Participants and recruitment
The study recruited centre-based childcare services in
the Hunter New England region. A list of all 366 child-
care services in the region provided by the Early Child-
hood Education and Care Directorate (the Government
Licensing Authority) served as the sampling frame.
Study information and consent forms were mailed to
services approximately 2 weeks before a telephone call
from a research assistant assessing eligibility and
requesting consent to participate in data collection.Services catering exclusively for children requiring spe-
cialist care, mobile preschools, and Department of Edu-
cation and Communities preschools were excluded as
they were outside of the ethics approval, as were services
already involved in an alternative RCT currently under-
way in the Hunter New England region. Services already
identified through local health service data as compre-
hensively implementing healthy eating and physical ac-
tivity policies and practices were also excluded. Eligible,
consenting services were randomly allocated to the
intervention or control group.
Randomisation and blinding
Eligible childcare services were allocated to intervention
or control in a 1:1 ratio using computerised random
number function undertaken by an independent statisti-
cian. Randomisation occurred prior to service consent to
participate and baseline data collection. Staff responsible
for recruitment of childcare services and data collectors
were blinded to group allocation. Childcare services
were not made aware of which study group they were al-
located to until after baseline data collection.
Implementation strategy
Policies and practices targeted for implementation
We sought to increase service implementation of healthy
eating and physical activity policies and practices con-
sistent with best practice Australian healthy eating and
physical activity guidelines for the childcare setting [ 12],
and evidence reviews of policies and practices shown to
be associated with child healthy eating and physical ac-
tivity [ 20,32]. The policies and practices targeted for im-
plementation included:
1. Service having written nutrition, physical activity,
and small screen recreation policies.
2. Service providing information to families (healthy
eating, physical activity, small screen time, and
breast-feeding, where relevant)
3. Service providing structured and specific learning
experiences about healthy eating at least two times
per week
4. Service supplying age-appropriate drinks to children
(only water and age-appropriate milk)
5. Service conducting fundamental movement skills
activities for children aged 3 –5 years every day to at
least 90% of children
6. Service limiting the use of small screen recreation
by children aged 3 –5 years to only educational
purposes and for learning experiences
The policies and practices were identified and targeted
from a broader group of 15 practices for which Hunter
New England Population Health was responsible forFinch et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:17 Page 3 of 13
supporting childcare services to implement as part of a
state-wide childhood obesity prevention initiative (Healthy
Children Initiative). Policies and practices in this interven-
tion were selected on the basis of existing health service
monitoring data summarising policy and practice im-
plementation by childcare services in the region [ 33].
The sub-groups of targeted practices were included as
they were those identified to have low prevalence of
implementation.
Strategies
The implementation intervention was primarily deliv-
ered to nominated supervisors of each childcare service
via five cycles of performance review and facilitated
feedback conducted over a period of 10 months. Forma-
tive work including consultations with local childcare
services was conducted to identify relevant factors that
may impede local implementation of the targeted pol-
icies and practices. Damschroder ’s Consolidated Frame-
work for Implementation Research (CFIR) was then
used to help classify barriers and inform strategy content
[34]. Damschroder ’s Consolidated Framework for Imple-
mentation Research integrates 19 theoretical models and
is composed of five major domains identified as influen-
tial in successful implementation: innovation character-
istics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the
individuals involved, and the process of implementation
[34]. Table 1provides a summary of the four targeted
constructs and how these were applied.
The initial performance review was completed
in-person by trained suppor t officers (1.5-h duration).
Detail regarding the content of the visit is described
in the protocol paper [ 30]. The four subsequent
reviews were completed via telephone (30-min dur-
ation). Support officers had qualifications in nutrition,
exercise physiology, psych ology, and health education,
with at least 2 years ’experience working with child-
care centres. Each performance review included a
standard assessment of the implementation of the tar-
geted policy and practice (completed via telephone by
support officers). Facilitated feedback included a dis-
cussion of current implementation status, assessed on
the basis of information reported by the nominated
supervisor using standard criteria with support
tailored to meet service needs based on the policies
and practices not being implemented. During each
contact, implementation support staff facilitated a dis-
cussion regarding how to implement policies and
practices to best suit the service needs and advice
provided on the use of tools and resources was tai-
lored based on identified barriers in line with service
identified priorities. Where services were already
meeting a policy or practice, implementation support
was directed towards policies and practices not yetachieved. A follow-up email was then sent after the
contact summarising agreed actions and providing
resources.
Based on reviews of empirical research evidence, we
aimed to incorporate components shown to be associ-
ated with greater effect in audit and feedback interven-
tions targeting professional practice change. A detailed
outline of the evidence and description of how it was ap-
plied to the intervention in practice is reported in the
protocol paper [ 30]. In brief, these included providing
feedback from a reputable source via experienced gov-
ernment health service support officers known to the
services [ 26]; multimodal feedback provided in person
(at the initial visit), via telephone, and in written form
[26]; feedback tailored to each individual service context
and identified implementation barriers; and use of
reinforcement, facilitated reflection, problem-solving,
goal setting, and action planning [ 26,35–38]. Support
officers monitored and recorded intervention delivery in
a database. In addition, nominated supervisors were ex-
pected by service staff to offer support for the imple-
mentation of the targeted practices and to communicate
goals and action plans, as well as progress.
Intervention services were provided with resources to
support the implementation of these policies (policy
templates, DVD, manuals, posters, and parent lunchbox
resources). The policy templates were word documents
to enable the service to amend to suit the needs of their
service and provided an example aim, rationale with
sample strategies that supported the recommended prac-
tices. They also referred to relevant childcare standards
and regulations and provided a prompt for a timeframe
for policy review. The DVD described fundamental
movement skills and demonstrated children practicing
and educators engaging in i ntentional teaching of
these skills. Posters encouraged healthy eating and
physical activity in young children, for example,
healthy drinks and active play (available from http://
www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Con-
tent/phd-gug-posters ). Lunchbox resources included a
parent brochure providing a list of recommended
foods to be packed including recipe ideas and label
reading. Program resources are available from http://
www.goodforkids.nsw.gov.au /early-childhood-services /.
Services were also emailed four electronic newslet-
ters which communicated key messages relating to
the targeted healthy eating and physical activity pol-
icies and practices [ 39], provided web links for add-
itional information, and included case studies from
individual services report ing successful approaches
and strategies to improve or sustain policy or prac-
tice implementation or describing new or novel
problem-solving approaches to alleviate service im-
plementation barriers.Finch et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:17 Page 4 of 13
Table 1 Application of the consolidated framework for implementation research
Construct Application to intervention
Intervention characteristics
Intervention source: Was the intervention developed internally by
childcare services or by external agencies?The implementation strategies were designed externally by an expert
advisory group of health promotion practitioners, psychologists, dietitians,
behavioural scientists, and physical activity experts, in consultation with
nominated supervisors from local childcare services. Facilitated feedback
was provided from a reputable source via experienced government
health service support officers known to the services.
Evidence strength and quality: What are the nominated supervisor
perceptions of the strength and quality of evidence that the
intervention will have the intended outcomes?Targeted policies and practices were consistent with national mandatory
licensing and accreditation requirements and state government evidence-
based healthy eating and physical activity best practice guidelines for the
setting. These links were communicated to nominated supervisors during
telephone contacts and via newsletters.
Adaptability: Is the intervention able to be adapted or tailored to
meet the needs of the childcare service?Telephone discussions included a focus on facilitating adaptation around
ways in which practices could be applied in each service (e.g. different
methods of communicating with families or integration of structured
learning experiences within service routines).
Complexity :What are the nominated supervisor perceptions of
implementation difficulty?Telephone discussions focused on integrating policy and practice change
within existing service routines to reduce the burden on each childcare
service. This was communicated during telephone contact and highlighted
via case studies included in newsletters.
Design quality and packaging: What are the nominated supervisor
perceptions of how the intervention is presented?Tools and resources were reviewed by nominated supervisors to ensure
that they were visually appealing, professionally presented, and user-
friendly during formative work preceding the trial.
Cost: What are the costs of the intervention and associated
implementation?As the implementation strategies formed part of Hunter New England
Population Health ’s routine service delivery, they were provided at no cost
to the service. In addition, suggestions given to services to support policy
and practice implementation prioritised low or no cost approaches. These
were communicated during telephone contacts and via case studies
included in newsletters.
Outer setting
External policy and incentives: What are the external strategies to
spread the intervention (including policy and regulations, external
mandates, recommendations, and guidelines)?Targeted policies and practices were consistent with national mandatory
licensing and accreditation requirements and state government evidence-
based healthy eating and physical activity best practice guidelines for the
setting.
The application of continuous quality improvement processes (facilitated
reflection, problem-solving, goal setting, and action planning) during
telephone contacts also aligns with external accreditation requirements for
the child care setting.
Inner setting
Tension for change: Does the nominated supervisor perceive the
current situation as needing to change?The need for change was demonstrated via individualised feedback reports
of policy and practice implementation and advocated by implementation
support staff during telephone contacts.
Relative priority: Do childcare service staff have a shared perception
of the importance of implementation within the childcare service?Nominated supervisors nominated supervisors were expected to endorse
implementation of the targeted practices and to communicate goals and
action plans, as well as progress to service staff.
Organisational incentives and rewards: Does the intervention include
incentives such as goal-sharing awards, performance reviews, and
increased stature?Services that demonstrate achievement of all policies and practices
received a certificate of recognition and were promoted to other
intervention services in newsletters.
Goals and feedback: Are goals clearly communicated, acted upon,
and fed back to nominated supervisor?Facilitated performance feedback was provided to services regarding
implementation of targeted policies and practices.
Continuous quality improvement processes including review of progress,
positive reinforcement, and discussion of deficits identified from feedback
reports, problem-solving, goal setting, and action planning were
incorporated into the telephone contacts.
Leadership engagement: Are nominated supervisors committed,
involved, and accountable for the implementation?Nominated supervisors were encouraged to circulate feedback reports to
management committees and childcare service staff.
Access to information and knowledge: How easy is it for nominated
supervisors to access information and knowledge about the
intervention and how to incorporate it into work tasks?Nominated supervisors received resources and ongoing support from
implementation support staff via scheduled telephone contacts and email.
Services were also provided with contact details for implementation
support staff and encouraged to follow-up at any time for advice or assistanceFinch et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:17 Page 5 of 13
Comparison
Control group services received the same four electronic
newsletters (described above) during the intervention
period, but did not receive any other resources. Staff
could implement any of the recommended practices de-
scribed in the newsletter, but did not receive support in
doing so. At completion of the intervention period, con-
trol services were offered the complete intervention.
Outcomes
Computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) were used
to collect data at baseline and 12-month follow-up. The
interviews were conducted as part of government-funded
service delivery with baseline and follow-up data collec-
tion aligned with 12-monthly routine practice assessment.
The survey was undertaken with the nominated super-
visor or lead educator at each service. In Australia, nomi-
nated supervisors are responsible for policy development,
ensuring compliance with licensing and accreditation re-
quirements and most also have teaching roles. The sur-
veys assessed service characteristics and implementation
of healthy eating and physical activity policies and prac-
tices [ 40] and took approximately 15 –25 min to complete.
CATI interviewers were blind to study group allocation
(Additional file 1).
The primary outcome was the change in prevalence of
services implementing all six targeted healthy eating and
physical activity policies and practices at 12 months.
Twelve items assessed the implementation of six policies
and practices. The items have been validated and used in
previous trials [ 15,40–43] and included:
1. Services having written nutrition, physical activity,
and small screen recreation policies (three items)
(all three) (which may be combined with another
policy) (yes/no to having all three).
2. Service providing information to families on healthy
eating, physical activity, small screen time, and
breast-feeding, where relevant (four items) (all
topics). Information was required to be distributed
at least once in the last 12 months and could includematerial handed directly to parents, mailed or
emailed or placed in their child ’sp i g e o nh o l eo r
bag, or information included in newsletters or at
orientation (yes/no to all topics). Examples could
include a list of recommended foods for lunchboxes
and lunchbox ideas, physical activity and screen time
recommendations for children, and breastfeeding
guidelines.
3. Service providing structured and specific learning
experiences about healthy eating at least two times
per week (one item, yes/no). Examples included
experiential activities about food, cooking skills,
food growing (e.g. kitchen/vegetable gardens,
planting seeds), tasting sessions, and discussion
around “everyday ”and “sometimes ”foods.
4. Service only supplying age-appropriate drinks to
children including water and reduced fat plain milk
(one item) (yes/no). For children less than 2 years
old, the service reported supplying plain full-fat milk.
5. Service conducting fundamental movement skills
activities for children aged 3 –5 years every day to
at least 90% of children (two items). Where service
reports the average number of days per week that
educators lead structured activities to develop
Fundamental Movement Skills (could be during
transition activity, group or circle time, or during
outdoor play) is equal to all service opening days,
and where service estimate of the percent of
children that usually participate is 90% or greater
(or are encouraged to participate if special needs).
6. Service limiting the use of small screen recreation
(one item) (i.e. TVs, videos, DVD, computers and
other electronic games, iPads/tablets) by children
aged 3 –5 years to only educational purposes and for
learning experiences such as to gain knowledge or
share information about a specific learning area or
child ’s interest or to facilitate exploration of activity,
dance, or movement (yes/no).

the measures of practice implementation, we also reportTable 1 Application of the consolidated framework for implementation research (Continued)

Process
Engaging: Are appropriate individuals involved in the
implementation through education, role modelling, and training?Nominated supervisors were directly engaged in implementation through
telephone discussions regarding service priorities, service goals, and
strategies to meet goals and overcome barriers. Nominated supervisors
were also encouraged to communicate and endorse practice changes to
service educators.
External change agents: Are individuals available who are affiliated
with an outside entity who facilitate intervention decisions in a
desirable direction?Facilitated feedback and implementation support was provided from a
reputable source via experienced government health service support
officers known to the services.Finch et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:17 Page 6 of 13
the proportion of services that implemented each of the
policies and practices at baseline and 12 months, the
mean number of practice services were compliant with,
and the breakdown for each individual policy and for in-
formation home to families. These measures were not
prospectively registered.
Service characteristics included service type, days
open, ages catered for, hours of operation, number of
children enrolled, and number of primary contact teach-
ing staff. Intervention participants also completed a sur-
vey about their satisfaction with the intervention
components including program resources, feedback re-
ports, support calls, and newsletters at completion of the
intervention. Eleven items were assessed using a 7-point
Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).
Data regarding intervention fidelity was sourced from
program records which were collected by research staff
during implementation.
Sample size calculation
A sample size of 152 services (76 per group) can detect a
difference of 20% in the prevalence of services implement-
ing all targeted policies or practices with 80% power and
alpha of 0.05, assuming 10% of control services implement
all targeted policies and practices at follow-up. A differ-
ence of 20% was deemed by the Population Health Unit
(HNEPH) responsible for improving policy and practice
implementation as meaningful from a public health ser-
vice delivery perspective and similar to policy and practice
changes observed in previous studies conducted by the re-
search team in this setting [ 42,43].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.2
statistical software. Descriptive statistics were used to
describe the demographic and service characteristics of
the study sample. Sample characteristics were compared
using Fisher ’s exact test (percentages) and the ttest
(means). Intervention effectiveness was determined
using logistic regression, controlling for baseline. The
primary analysis was based on an intention-to-treat
framework. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken using im-
putation of baseline values for missing follow-up data
[44]. Additional sub-group analyses of the primary trial
outcome were pre-specified and undertaken by childcare
service geographic location (urban [regional cities and
inner regional areas] or rural [outer regional and remote
areas]) as determined by the Australian Standard Geo-
graphic Classification. Socioeconomic status was classi-
fied according to the Socioeconomic Indices for Areas,
and services were grouped by postcode as being in the
top 50% of New South Wales or the bottom 50% of New
South Wales. All statistical tests were two-tailed with an
αof 0.05.Results
Response rates and sample characteristics
Figure 1describes the participation of services in the
trial. Of the 366 childcare services in the region, 128
were excluded given their involvement in an alternative
RCT, a further 30 did not meet inclusion criteria, and an
additional 77 were identified as comprehensively imple-
menting healthy eating and physical activity policies and
practices. A total of 131 services were randomised
among which 68 were allocated to intervention and 63
to the control. Six services allocated to the intervention
and 17 services allocated to the control group did not
provide baseline data and were therefore excluded.
There were 62 intervention services and 46 control ser-
vices that provided baseline data, giving a consent rate
of 82%. At 12-month follow-up, five intervention partici-
pants and three control participants were unavailable to
complete follow-up.
Service characteristics
Service characteristics by intervention and control group
are shown in Table 2. Intervention groups were similar
at baseline. The majority of services were long day care
services (73.0%), and one third were preschool services
(32.8%). Almost all services were open for 5 days per
week (93.0%). Food was provided by the service for the
children in 60% of services and by the family in 34% of
services. Services were open for an average of 9 h per
day. The majority of services in both groups were lo-
cated in a metropolitan or inner regional city (61.4%)
with 38.7% classified as outer regional or remote areas.
Implementation of healthy eating and physical activity
policies and practices
Primary trial outcome
There were no services that were implementing all of
the six policies and practices at baseline, and few who
were meeting all six practices at follow-up (9.7% [ n=6 ]
intervention services and 17.4% [ n= 8] control services)
(mean difference 0.51; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.58; p= 0.24)
(Table 3). Sensitivity analyses carrying baseline observa-
tion forward for missing data were also non-significant.
There were no significant differences between groups on
the primary trial outcome at follow-up by socioeconomic
(mean difference 1.25; 95% CI 0.12 to 12.84; p= 0.85) or
geographic subgroups location (mean difference 0.55;
95% CI 0.05 to 5.85; p= 0.62).
Table 2shows the proportion of services that were
compliant with each policy or practice at baseline and
12-month follow-up. At baseline, the proportion of ser-
vices already implementing healthy eating learning expe-
riences and limiting the use of small screen recreation
was high. Between baseline and follow-up, there were in-
creases in compliance for all policies and practices inFinch et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:17 Page 7 of 13
both intervention and control services, with no signifi-
cant differences between groups. The largest increases
over time were observed for intervention services pro-
viding information to families (by 27.4%) and the service
having written policies (by 17.8%).
Other outcomes
There were no differences between the groups in the
number of practice services were compliant with (mean
difference 0.1; 95% CI −0.4 to 0.6; p= 0.71). At baseline,
intervention services were compliant with a mean of 3.4
(95% CI 3.1 to 3.6) practices, which increased to 4.0
practices at follow-up (95% CI 3.8 to 4.3). Control ser-
vices were compliant with 3.4 practices at baseline (95%
CI 3.1 to 3.6) and increased to 3.9 practices at follow-up
(95% CI 3.5 to 4.4).
Intervention fidelity and acceptability
Overall, more than half (56.5%; n= 35) of services partic-
ipated in all five performance review and feedback cycles(contacts). Participation rate for each of the five contacts
ranged between 83 and 93% ( n=5 2 –58). The mean
number of contacts was 3.56 (SD 1.58) and range 0 to 5.
Most services reported that intervention components
were helpful (Table 4) and that they were happy with the
frequency of support calls and e-newsletters.
Discussion
This study sought to test an audit and facilitated feed-
back intervention to improve the implementation of
healthy eating and physical activity-promoting policies
and practices in the childcare setting. The study found
the intervention was not effective in improving, relative
to control, the implementation of targeted policies and
practices. Findings indicate that such an intervention in
isolation may not be sufficient to improve childcare en-
vironments, suggesting policymakers and practitioners
may require more intensive strategies to support practice
change in this setting.
Study findings contrast with previous research in the
field [ 25]. Three targeting the implementation of healthyFig. 1 Participant flow chartFinch et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:17 Page 8 of 13
eating and physical activity practices included in a recent
Cochrane review trials tested multi-component imple-
mentation strategies (for example, staff workshops, pol-
icy support, resources, and follow-up contact/support)
capable of addressing a number of barriers to change
[45–47] and reported significant improvements in meas-
ure of policy or practice implementation. The lack of
evidence of improvement in implementation found in
the current study suggests future strategies may need
to address a more comprehensive range of barriers to
that achieved through audit and facilitated feedback
(e.g. beliefs about capabilities and consequences)
alone [ 48]. For example, views of parents and child-
care service management are important in the imple-
mentation of obesity prevention practices, as is the
accessibility of external resources to support imple-
mentation [ 49].
The potential impact of the implementation strategy
may have been hindered by targeting nominated supervi-
sors of childcare services. While nominated supervisors
are ultimately responsible for service operations, actualimplementation of obesity prevention practices requires
the action of service staff. In this trial, we did not assess
the extent to which nominated supervisors engaged with
childcare service staff to support service improvement as
a result of the intervention. Failure of the nominated
supervisor to do so may have reduced the potential im-
pact of the implementation strategy as previous research
suggests that implementation is more likely to occur if
appropriate individuals or groups are engaged in the
change process [ 34]. The use of strategies to ensure
greater penetration of performance review and feedback
across childcare service staff may therefore be required
[34]. Targeting multiple policies and practices may
have also reduced the potential effect of the imple-
mentation strategy in this trial compared to targeting
a single policy or practice. Interventions perceived as
complex and placing greater demand on childcare ser-
vices and their staff are less likely to be implemented
[34]. In settings such as schools, strategies targeting
single health policies have yielded large improvements
in implementation [ 49]. Such an approach could beTable 2 Baseline demographic comparison of study groups

Furthermore, the introduction of the National Quality
Standards for the setting (including nutrition and phys-
ical activity elements) in the 12 months prior to thecommencement of the trial and broad government sup-
port for implementation of policies and practices occur-
ring state-wide may have also facilitated policy and

reducing the likelihood of an intervention effect.Table 3 Proportion of services implementing policies and practices at baseline and follow-up

The trial used random assignment and blinding of out-
come assessor to improve internal validity and used prob-
ability sampling, less stringent eligibility criteria, and was
conducted in the context of a service delivery initiative,
maximising external validity. However, there were a num-
ber of limitations. First was the use of phone survey for
audits conducted remotely (off-site) and reliant on nomi-
nated supervisor self-report of implementation outcomes.
While validated and used in previous trials, such measures
are prone to reporting bias such as social desirability bias
[50]. The use of on-site observation or measurement tri-
angulation techniques should be considered for future
intervention to improve the robustness of audit and re-
search findings [ 51]. Secondly, the quantitative nature of
the outcome measure limited our capacity to collect con-
textual information that may have provided greater insight
into any systematic or structural barriers to implementa-
tion. Third, outcomes were assessed post-intervention at
one time point only. Additional time points would allow
for more sophisticated analyses and potential assessment
of sustainability. Furthermore, there is possible bias in the
sample given that potential participants had already
declined to participate in another intervention. This
may indicate the participating services may have been
less likely to adopt the policies and practices targeted
in the intervention. In addition, the study was
under-powered. Finally, the measure used to assess
the practices may not have been sensitive enough to
detect changes in implementation.
Notwithstanding study lim itations, the trial makes
an important contribution to a limited evidence base
on the effectiveness of performance review and feed-
back as a standalone implementation strategy. While
self-assessment, audit, or feedback is a common elem-
ent of most previously trialled strategies to improve
implementation of nutrition and physical activity pol-
icies and practices [ 25], in isolation audit and facili-
tated feedback does not appear to be sufficient to
achieve implementation improvements. For policymakers
and practitioners, the findings underscore the need for
consideration of additional implementation strategies in
future trials to maximise obesity prevention initiatives in
this setting. Strategies that address the reported barriers to
implementation that include specific behaviour change
techniques [ 48] (e.g. prompts/cues, material reward, habit
formation) or accounting for policy context (e.g. changing
licensure requirements) are two areas that may offer
promise.
Conclusion
A performance review and facilitated feedback interven-
tion was not effective in improving the implementation
of healthy eating and physical activity-promoting policiesand practices within childcare services. Future research
targeting multiple health policies or practices in this set-
ting should include additional implementation support.
Gaps remain in available evidence to inform programs
delivered in real-world conditions aiming to support the
implementation of healthy eating and physical activity
policies and practices as part of routine practice in child-
care services [ 52].
