Abstract
Background: Child stunting, an indicator of chronic malnutrition, is a global public health problem. Malnutrition
during pregnancy and the first 2 years of life undermines the survival, growth, and development of children.
Exposure to fecal pathogens vis-à-vis inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) has been implicated in the
etiology of child stunting, highlighting the need to integrate WASH with nutrition-sensitive interventions to
comprehensively address this comple x problem. The aim of this study was to describe a systematic, theoretically
informed approach (that drew from the Starr and Fornoff approach to the Theory of Change development and the
Behavior Change Wheel approach) to desig n a multi-component and integrated soci al and behavior change intervention
to improve WASH and nutrition-related behaviors in western Kenya.
Methods: This intervention was developed to be integrated into an existing project that utilized the care group model
and aimed to create a culture of care and support for HIV/AID S-affected children under two and their caregivers and was
executed by local partners. We tested the newly created int e r v e n t i o np a c k a g e si nu s e r - t e s t i n gt r i a l su s i n ga na d a p t e d

Results: Using authentic stakeholder engagement and relevant theories, we conducted an 8-step process: (1) conduct

functions, (6) develop the intervention plan, (7) create the intervention packages, and (8) test and refine the intervention
packages.
Conclusions: This study highlights the need to take a multi-sectorial, integrated appro ach that integrates contextually
relevant behavior change theories with the experiential knowledge gleaned from stakeholders into the design of
interventions that seek to reduce child stunting. This proce ss resulted in the creation of intervention packages that
grouped behaviors thematically to be most relevant and re sponsive to the population c ontext. This work has the
potential to make important contributions towards achievement of the United Nations ’sustainable development goals.

Background
Child stunting, an indicator of chronic malnutrition, is a
global public health problem. Malnutrition during preg-
nancy and the first 2 years of life undermines the survival,
growth, and development of children [ 1,2]. The etiology
of early childhood malnutrition is complex, involving in-
teractions between parental feeding practices, dietary in-
takes, and nutrient absorptive capabilities. Gastrointestinal
and other infectious diseases, determined by a household
and community ’s access to adequate water, sanitation,
hygiene, and health services, increase nutritional needs
and can further exacerbate malnutrition [ 3–5]. If not ad-
dressed, malnutrition can impair gross motor, fine motor,
and cognitive development with later implications for
schooling success and economic productivity in adult-
hood. Chronic malnutrition in early childhood also predis-
poses individuals to cardiovascular disease in adulthood
[3–5]. Global leaders recently pledged to reduce chronic
malnutrition among children under age five by 40% by
2025 [ 6]. Nutrition-specific interventions —those aimed at
improving nutrient intakes and diet practices —are, on
their own, insufficient to achieve these reductions even
when delivered at scale and with high coverage [ 7,8]. As a
result, there is interest in developing, testing, and evaluat-
ing multi-sectorial and integrated approaches to tackle the
underlying determinants of child nutrition [ 9,10]. Known
as nutrition-sensitive approaches, these include nutrition-
sensitive agriculture [ 10,11], poverty reduction [ 9], girls ’
education [ 10,12], birth spacing [ 13], and women ’s
empowerment [ 14].
In addition, research implicates early and chronic, even
asymptomatic, infections with fecal pathogens in the
etiology of stunting [ 15,16]. Clean drinking water,
sanitation facilities that hygienically separate feces from
human contact, and appropriate hygiene behaviors, such
as handwashing with soap —together known as WASH —
can reduce exposures to harmful enteric pathogens of
both human and animal origins [ 17]. In the absence of
these environmental improvements and associated behav-
iors, children are at risk of stunting due to extended and
repeated occurrences of diarrhea [ 18], soil-transmitted
helminth infections [ 19], and asymptomatic infections that
itself can lead to environmental enteric dysfunction, a
chronic condition that reduces intestinal nutrient absorp-
tion [ 20,21].
However, field trials have found limited efficacy and
effectiveness of improving WASH on child growth
[22–24]. While it may be that improvements to the
hygienic environment do not impact stunting, it is
more likely that they did not sufficiently reduce ex-
posure to fecal pathogens because the interventions
were not appropriate, were not delivered optimally, or
did not sufficiently target the appropriate exposure
pathways [ 25,26].One critical limitation of many studies assessing the
impacts of WASH and nutrition interventions is that the
approaches to change behavior are delivered in parallel,
rather than as integrated packages. Menon and Frongillo
[26], in their recent commentary, highlighted the need
for integrated approaches that target the caregiving
dyad ’s lived reality and the social (i.e., household and
community members) and physical environment within
which caregiving occurs. They recommended including
or perhaps especially, integrating behavior change efforts
seamlessly into daily routines. Moreover, the theoretical
foundations of WASH and nutrition interventions are
rarely described, and thus, the pathways explaining how
interventions are expected to change behavior and ul-
timately reduce child stunting are poorly articulated
[27–31]. Recent reviews highlight a need to provide suf-
ficiently detailed descriptions of the process, theory, and
evidence bases used to develop stunting reduction pro-
grams and their theories of change [ 29,30,32–34]. Such
detail fosters transparency, allows for replication, and
gives greater insights into what specific techniques work
to change behavior and why.
Theoretical and methodological foundations
To that end, this study sought to develop an integrated
WASH/nutrition behavior change intervention. To design
the intervention, we applied two relevant theoretical and
methodological frameworks: (1) the Starr and Fornoff [ 35]
approach to Theory of change (TOC) development and
(2) the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) approach [ 36]t o
intervention design.
Theories of change are widely used in designing, plan-
ning, managing, evaluating, and scaling complex interven-
tions [ 27,34,37,38]. They are often developed through a
backwards mapping approach that starts with a clear goal
statement and then maps the r equired process of change to
achieve that goal through del ineation of antecedent out-
comes, behaviors, and behavioral determinants [ 38]. This
sequence of change is developed with a deep understanding
of context, including the assumptions, motivations, world-
views, and philosophies of relevant stakeholders [ 38]. In
addition to the sequence of change, TOCs articulate as-
sumptions related to the reach , coverage, capacity change,
program fidelity, behavior change, and benefits [ 39]. Such
delineation permits a robust ex amination of the process of
change. Experts recommend that a TOC should be devel-
oped as part of a multi-stakeholder and collaborative ex-
periential learning exercise [ 40]. The Starr and Fornoff [ 35]
process for TOC development entails engaging stake-
holders to describe a curren t problem through formative
research, map the underlying causes, identify the long-term
changes needed to address the problem, and develop the
activities that need to occur to create the desired long-term
change.Jacob Arriola et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:10 Page 2 of 16
Given that a TOC is a pragmatic framework for describ-
ing how an intervention will produce change, it is
strengthened by the integration of key behavioral, social,
or psychological theories that explain why certain path-
ways to change are expected to exist [ 27,28]. If integrated
into a TOC properly, these theories explain the types of
behavior change that are expected to occur and aid in spe-
cification of activities that may produce the desired behav-
ior change. To that end, we adapted key steps from the
BCW approach [ 36] to develop the intervention plan.
The BCW approach characterizes behavioral systems
using the “COM-B ”model. Analogous to that of Roth-
schild [ 41], the COM-B model hypothesizes that vol-
itional behavior is determined by behavioral capability
(or the physical and psychological skills necessary to per-
form the behavior), opportunity (or the physical and so-
cial supports or restraints on the behavior), and
motivation (or the reflective and automatic processes
that direct behavior). The BCW process, like the Starr
and Fornoff approach to TOC development, begins with
understanding and defining priority behaviors in a given
context using formative research. Following specification
of the behavior (i.e., the who, what, when, where, how
often, and with whom) and using findings from forma-
tive research, the BCW approach applies the COM-B
model to identify and characterize specific behaviors and
behavioral antecedents known as theoretical domains
[42]. These domains bridge to relevant behavior change
approaches referred to as intervention functions [ 36,42].
A taxonomy of behavior change techniques [ 43,44]i s
then used to map intervention functions to specific and
appropriate approaches that facilitate behavior change.
Aims
Aligned with a call to document intervention development
processes, our manuscript describes a systematic and the-
oretically informed approach to design an integrated social
and behavior change intervention to improve WASH and
nutrition-related behaviors in western Kenya, with the
goal of reducing child stunting [ 45]. Through application
of the BCW to this work, we developed three thematic
intervention packages to reduce child stunting: (1) food
preparation and storage, (2) mealtime behaviors, and (3)
clean family environment (see Table 1)[36]. Our ap-
proach balanced evidence from the peer-reviewed litera-
ture and stakeholder expertise. Our goals in presenting
this detailed description of our intervention design process
include fostering transparency, enabling replication, and
providing greater insights into what specific techniques
work to change behavior and why.
Methods
The integrated WASH/nutrition behavior change inter-
vention was designed to be implemented as part of theTHRIVE II project executed by local partners of Cath-
olic Relief Services, the primary implementing partner,
in Kenya. THRIVE II was a two-year project that began
in January 2016, of which the goal was to create a cul-
ture of care and support for HIV- and AIDS-affected
children under 2 years and their caregivers in Kenya,
Tanzania, and Malawi. It represented work that contin-
ued from the initial project, THRIVE, which had the
same overall goal. The local partners, Homa Hills Com-
munity Development Organization and Mercy Orphans,
were responsible for the supervision and ground support
of the project. Using the Care Group model [ 46],
THRIVE II provided ongoing support to caregivers of
children under two years of age to practice early child-
hood stimulation, positive parenting, and optimal infant
and young child feeding and WASH behaviors. Commu-
nity health workers trained volunteer lead mothers who
disseminate health messaging to small groups (6 –12
mothers) and conduct home visits to support ongoing
behavior change. At the community level, strategies were
implemented to strengthen the capacity of health facil-
ities to support early stimulation and positive parenting
counseling. In Kenya, the project targeted an estimated
population of 3120 pregnant mothers and caregivers of
children below 2 years of age.
We tested the newly created intervention packages in
user testing trials using an adapted Trials of improved
practices (TIPs) approach [ 47]. User testing sought to
give participants voice in program design and to gauge
the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention com-
ponents as a way to maximize uptake and effectiveness.
The duration of TIPs varies depending on the behavior
but often lasts 5 –7 days for nutrition-related iterations.
Trials of improved practice often occur over three visits,
with the first visit used to assess challenges performing
the optimal behaviors, the second visit to provide feed-
back and negotiate adoption of potential solutions, and a
third visit to evaluate uptake and gather family perspec-
tives on the solution. Analysis of both quantitative and
qualitative data from these three visits serves to identify
key determinants of and feasible solutions for problem
behaviors. Sample size is typically 20 –50 families, se-
lected for heterogeneity [ 47]. We adapted the traditional
TIPs process by focusing our analysis on the feasibility
and acceptability of the newly developed intervention
packages and extended the user testing period beyond
the usual 5 –7 days.
We held to the following key foundational principles
throughout the intervention design process: (1) Authen-
tic stakeholder engagement is crucial to the successful
design of the intervention, (2) relevant theories of behav-
ior change should inform the design and development of
the intervention, (3) the intervention should target indi-
vidual and/or community-level behavior (versus policyJacob Arriola et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:10 Page 3 of 16
or physical structures), (4) the intervention must be able
to be delivered by trained community health volunteers
in the context of the existing intervention (Care Group
model), and (5) the intervention must have the potential
for sustainability beyond the life of the project.
Results
Step 1: conduct mixed methods formative research
The first step in our process, formative research, in-
formed “how best to incorporate aspects of programme
design and implementation into the environmental and
cultural context ”[48–50], (p., 64). This step served to
identify the suite of relevant behaviors for action, build
the evidence to support pathways of change, and identify
existing resources that could support positive behavior
change [ 35]. We conducted formative research in two
phases: desk review and primary data collection. We first
reviewed the findings of mixed methods research con-
ducted by the THRIVE II program in the program areasof Homa Bay County and Migori County [ 51]. The desk
review served to identify (1) optimal WASH and mater-
nal and child nutrition behaviors with low uptake, (2)
the socio-demographic characteristics of the communi-
ties, and (3) gaps in understanding key habits, know-
ledge, beliefs and attitudes, barriers and facilitators to
optimal maternal/child nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation
behaviors [ 51]. Findings from the desk review informed
the protocols and guiding questions for a second round
of ethnographic research that aimed to provide greater
contextual detail, clarify key barriers and facilitators of
behavior change to infant and young child feeding and
WASH-related behaviors, identify messages that reso-
nated with caregivers, explore in more depth the opin-
ions and experiences of caregivers, and determine
potential sources of information [ 52]. Data were col-
lected in six rural communities in Migori ( n= 3) and
Homa Bay Counties ( n= 3). Data collection consisted of
market surveys ( n= 4); focus group discussions withTable 1 Final list of targeted nutrition and WASH behaviors

pregnant women and mothers of children under two,
fathers, and grandmothers ( n= 24); key informant inter-
views with community health workers, community and
religious leaders, implementing partners, and staff at the
funding agency ( n= 29); household spot-checks to as-
certain WASH hardware and general hygiene ( n= 12);
and structured household observations of WASH and
feeding behaviors ( n= 24). Based on a total of 83 activ-
ities that reached 288 study participants, the results indi-
cated a range of barriers and facilitators that influenced
families ’practice of maternal and child nutrition and
WASH behaviors (Table 2). These findings are elabo-
rated elsewhere [ 52].Step 2: prioritize target behaviors
Step 2 served to focus the scope of the intervention by
prioritizing target behaviors. Informed by the formative
research, we prioritized a preliminary set of nine target
behaviors for intervention development: optimal maternal
diet, exclusive breastfeeding, optimal complementary
feeding, maternal handwashing, washing of children ’s
hands, safe child feces disposal, latrine use, handwashing
station presence and use, and food hygiene. Four criteria
informed this selection: (1) The behavior was not widely
practiced, (2) there were opportunities to integrate
behavior-specific activities into current THRIVE II pro-
gramming, (3) there was plausibility or evidence of the

relationship between the behavior and child stunting
based on scientific research, and (4) the potential for
changing the behavior was plausible given available re-
sources and the scope of THRIVE II activities. This pre-
liminary list of behaviors evolved over subsequent steps as
stakeholders offered continued input, illustrating the itera-
tive nature of this process.
Step 3: use causal analysis to create problem trees
The aims of step 3 were to clearly articulate problem
statements (e.g., handwashing at key times with soap is
not practiced), identify strong and weak causal linkages
for each of the identified problem behaviors, and create
visual diagrams that specified the hierarchy of problems
and causes, and cross-causal linkages [ 35]. We used
problem trees to visualize the root and interrelated causes
of target problem behaviors f or stakeholder engagement.
Problem trees are widely used in participatory approaches
to develop health promotion interventions in developing
countries [ 53]. The study team used findings from step 1
and the initial list of behaviors identified in step 2 to gener-
ate preliminary problem trees for each of the target behav-
iors, articulating causes at mul tiple levels (e.g., household,
community). The problem tree s were then refined during
an intensive 3-day workshop with stakeholders, including
government workers, local im plementing partners, tech-
nical experts, and staff memb ers from the NGO central and
local office in Kisumu, Kenya.
Step 4: develop solution trees and articulate assumptions
and rationales for change
Following the production of problem trees, stakeholder
workshop participants collectively drafted solution trees
for each priority behavior, which corresponded to the
problem trees. Similar to processes in Intervention Map-
ping [ 54,55], solution trees translate the behavioral prob-
lems identified in problem trees (i.e., early introduction of
non-breastmilk substances) into positive goal statements
(i.e., refrains from giving liquids/foods before 6 months of
age) [ 35]. Using a backwards mapping approach [ 27,56,
57], positive actions, cognitive processes, and behaviors
needed to achieve each of the priority behaviors were
mapped. In converting problem trees to solution trees, we
recognized the need for greater specificity in how we artic-
ulated the problems. For example, in conceptualizing solu-
tions to achieve handwashing goals, we noted that “key
times ”for handwashing mattered and thus required nar-
rower categories and specification (e.g., “caretakers wash
hands with soap before eating ”or“caretakers wash hands
with soap before preparing food ”).
Stakeholders reviewed solution trees during the 3-day
workshop, identified needed revisions, and voted on pri-
ority behavioral determinants based on feasibility within
the programming context and potential for change.Additional behavioral determinants linked to the poten-
tial for impact on stunting were identified during the
post-workshop revision process. Once completed, each
solution tree included multiple, linked levels of motiv-
ational, cognitive, and behavioral solutions phrased as
goal statements (e.g., caregivers are motivated to wash
hands; caregivers have access to soap) that if achieved
would theoretically result in the practice of the priority
behavior (e.g., caretakers wash hands with soap before
eating). A final, collective review of the solution trees
and goal statements eliminated those that would be out-
side of the scope of the project due to budget, time,
existing programming, staff expertise, or those that did
not align with the aims of creating a behavioral interven-
tion (e.g., a policy-level intervention or a major struc-
tural intervention altering the environment).
Step 5: link the solution trees to intervention functions
Step 5 served to verify the hypothesized pathways of
change articulated in the solution trees and to link goal
statements, COM-B components, theoretical domains,
and intervention functions [ 36]. Two team members inde-
pendently mapped each goal statement (e.g., caretakers
wash hands with soap before eating) with behavioral de-
terminants from the solution trees (e.g., washing hands
before food preparation is perceived as convenient) onto
one of the six corresponding COM-B components (e.g.,
reflective motivation). Mapping outputs were compared
and assessed for consistency across researchers.
Next, we applied the theoretical domain framework
(TDF) to each of the goal statements and the determinants
identified in the solution trees [ 36]. The TDF, developed
and validated through systematic review and consensus
analysis, includes 128 explan atory constructs from 33 be-
havior change theories [ 58,59]. It serves as an integrative
framework synthesizing impor tant constructs across many
relevant theories, comprising 14 domains, including know-
ledge, skills, beliefs about cap abilities, reinforcement, etc.
The COM-B components served as a “cross-walk ”linking
the goal statements and their determinants to the TDFs.
After mapping the domains to the goal statements and de-
terminants, we identified spe cific intervention functions
(e.g., education, persuasion , modeling) that corresponded
with the relevant TDF. The culminating product of this
process was an intervention function table (Table 3). When
shared with Catholic Relief S ervices, they encouraged the
inclusion of more behaviors that they felt would be
manageable and critical given the local context. This
negotiation ended with the addition of behaviors that
would pointedly address environmental hygiene in the
compound, as well as expanding upon handwashing
and food hygiene behaviors (Table 1). Additional prob-
lem and solution trees were then developed, and step 5
was repeated for these new behaviors [ 58,59].Jacob Arriola et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:10 Page 6 of 16

Step 6: develop the intervention plan
The aim of step 6 was to identify potential behavior
change techniques that would utilize the intervention
functions to reach our desired outcomes. The use of the
overall delivery modality —the THRIVE II Care Group
model —was pre-specified as part of the overarching
intervention plan. Beyond this approach, we could de-
velop new social behavior change communication mater-
ial targeting community stakeholders (e.g., fathers). We
narrowed potential intervention approaches and outputs
by triangulating information from steps 1 to 5. Next, we
identified the behavior change techniques that corre-
sponded with the intervention functions selected in step
5. Behavior change techniques can be described as “ob-
servable, replicable, and irreducible component of an
intervention designed to alter or redirect causal pro-
cesses that regulate behavior ”[60]. We reviewed the
literature on WASH and nutrition-sensitive behavior
change projects with similar desired outcomes. We ana-
lyzed elements of these interventions by applying the
same taxonomy and steps (described in step 5) to the
intervention components to understand what had been
effective in other locations and which behavior change
techniques had potentially informed activities within
successful interventions [ 22,60–65].
Step 7: determine the intervention activities
The objective of this step was to develop specific inter-
vention activities and package them thematically. We de-
veloped intervention tables to show the connection
between the positive health goal statement from our so-
lution trees with COM-B domains, the TDF, interven-
tion functions, and behavior change techniques. In
determining what the intervention activities would be,
there was a need to address the challenge of impacting
multiple behaviors within the limited timeframe of TIPs
without reducing participants ’capability and motivation
to practice desired behaviors. Since the behaviors were
linked to daily household activities, we grouped them
into three separate thematic packages. The “clean com-
pound ”package (Table 3, Section A) aimed to improve
compound environmental hygiene to reduce children ’s
exposure to animal and human feces. The “mealtime ”
package (Table 3, Section B) aimed to improve caretaker
behaviors that related to household eating and feeding
times. The “food hygiene ”package (Table 3, Section C)
aimed to improve caretaker behaviors related to safe
food preparation and storage.
After grouping behaviors together, we assessed which
behavior change techniques were most appropriate for
each behavioral outcome, what potential activities would
come from behavior change techniques and how they
could be adapted within the Care Group model. For ex-
ample, the COM-B domain of social opportunity wasaddressed by incorporating grandmothers and fathers
into community and household activities. The behavior
change technique of social opportunity was approached
through activities encouraging lead mothers to model
these behaviors in their community.
Step 8: test and refine intervention packages
We adapted TIPs to test and refine the intervention
packages in the context of the Care Group model. Six
neighbor groups from Homa Bay ( N=3 )a n dM i g o r i
(N= 3) counties were evenly distributed to one of
the three intervention packages. Fathers and grand-
mothers were included in community and household
events. Trials of improved practices were implemented
over 5 weeks. Trained research assistants, community
health workers, and family members participated in a
community event to (1) raise awareness of the assigned
intervention package, (2) explore family members ’roles
and contributions to child health, (3) share knowledge on
targeted practices of their intervention arm (see Table 3),
and (4) make a public pledge of commitment to improve
practices. Research assistants conducted three household
visits. First, research assistants documented current be-
haviors, introduced intervention materials, targeted behav-
iors for change, discussed tailored strategies for behavior
change, and recorded participant pledges to practice be-
havior. After 3 weeks, research assistants monitored use of
materials, problem-solved challenges, addressed know-
ledge gaps, and encouraged participants to maintain be-
haviors. At 5 weeks, researchers collected participant
feedback on the intervention package including delivery,
materials, strengths, and weaknesses; recorded participant
uptake of key messages; and documented behavior
change. Focus group discussions with mothers ( N=6 )
assessed participant acceptability of messages and mate-
rials, and family participation and engagement in the pro-
moted practices.
Findings from TIPs demonstrated that thematic pack-
aging of behavior change strategies assisted people in
adopting more than one behavior. Some strategies neces-
sitated change: we emphasized social opportunity in TIPs
to overcome specific physical opportunity barriers (e.g.,
time, money, access to economic opportunities). To
achieve this, we included fathers and grandmothers in ac-
tivities and utilized social norms, pressures, and people ’s
roles towards their child(ren) to encourage all caregivers
to change behaviors. However, fathers and grandmothers
found it difficult to attend household counseling sessions.
Mothers were influenced by other women, whether neigh-
bors, co-wives, or community health workers.
We adapted the TIPs approach to accommodate the
Care Group model and emphasize the social relations of
female peers. To achieve this aim, we strengthened local
capacity by including community health workers andJacob Arriola et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:10 Page 10 of 16
care group women in a general training that focused on
increasing knowledge related to the three intervention
packages, and building facilitation and counseling skills.
Based on reported behavior changes during TIPs, care-
giver interest in the other intervention packages, and our
intent to design an integrated infant and young child
feeding and WASH intervention, we ultimately com-
bined the three packages into a single behavior change
strategy that would introduce one intervention package
each month through neighbor women meetings and
household counseling [ 66].
Discussion
Due to its complex etiology, reductions in child stunting
of the magnitude targeted for the Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals requires the integration of multiple sectors
[10]. When designed and implemented well, WASH
strategies can reduce the burden of diarrheal diseases
[22,24,67], though there has been little evidence of re-
ducing asymptomatic chronic infections, and stunting
reduction has not been demonstrated [ 22,23]. To do so,
interventions must achieve better adherence and suffi-
ciently block relevant transmission pathways [ 68]. Health
sector and mass media interventions can improve child
feeding and nutrient intakes [ 69–72], and agriculture
sector approaches may create an enabling food envir-
onment by improving diet quality, quantity, and safety
[10,11,73]. Despite statistical significance, the impacts
of direct nutritional programs to reduce stunting are rela-
tively modest. Researchers attribute these modest impacts
to several issues including limited multi-sectorial integra-
tion, limited application of contextually relevant and the-
oretically based behavior change theories and approaches
[32,41,74–76], and the underutilization of theories of
change in intervention design [ 28].
In reviewing the social/behavior change research lit-
erature, we noted that the experiences described in this
paper aligned with several consistently cited recommen-
dations for stunting prevention programs. They include
the following:
(1) Programs should be multi-sectorial to address
multiple etiologies and include both community-
based and family-focused approaches to reach
not only mothers but also other influential family
members such as fathers and mothers-in-law,
peers, and policy makers [ 10,54,61,74,77–79].
(2) Multi-sectoral interventi ons should be delivered in an
integrated way that accounts for the lived experience,
daily routines, and repeated behaviors of the caregivers
who may be the sources of pathogen exposure and
thus are expected to change behaviors [ 26,80].
(3) A deep understanding of context through formative
research should inform intervention design andTOC development; the process for linking
formative research findings to intervention
components should be systematic and clearly
articulated [ 28,32,50,74,81].
(4) An evidence-based and theory-informed TOC should
guide intervention design and be used throughout
the program life cycle including implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation [ 28,29,33,39,54,82].
(5) Intervention design should be grounded in behavior
change theories; these theories should be explicitly
articulated and utilized in the design of the theory
of change [ 29,54,74,83].
(6) Interventions should be multi-level and multi-
component integrating several relevant behavior
change theories and including activities that target
multiple (i.e., 2 or more) domains beyond knowledge
generation [ 29,54,84,85].
(7) Interventions should engage not only phases of
volitional behavior but maintenance as well, with
potentially different but relevant theories and
activities for each phase [ 86].
(8) Pilot-testing should be conducted prior to larger
scale implementation and testing to allow for
refinement and revision of behavior change
strategies and theories of change [ 47].
(9) Stakeholders should be engaged in the development
of the TOC and the design, implementation, and
evaluation of interventions [ 28,34].
To achieve alignment with these recommendations,
our process adapted and integrated four methods —
ethnographic formative research [ 50], an iterative and
participatory process to develop the intervention ’s theory
of change [ 35], a systematically developed and evidence-
based behavior change mapping exercise to identify
intervention approaches and components [ 36], and be-
havioral micro-trials to design and pilot intervention
components [ 47]. The formative research conducted for
our work aimed to provide rich contextual information
on the physical and social opportunity domains of our
priority behaviors. It also provided deeper understanding
of the motivations and capabilities that influenced be-
havior and highlighted the most appropriate community
and family-focused activities and delivery platforms, in-
cluding daily routines for integration. The findings of
our formative work directly informed our iterative
process to select priority behaviors, develop problem
and solution trees for each behavior, and identify inter-
vention packages and behavior change strategies most
appropriate for the study context.
The BCW [ 36] served as a starting point for our work
and a framework to identify relevant behavior change
domains and the most appropriate techniques for
achieving change of target behaviors in the study contextJacob Arriola et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:10 Page 11 of 16
(recommendation 5, above). For complex behaviors,
such as those related to diet or WASH, the BCW ap-
proach recommends using the TDF to gain greater spe-
cificity in terms of the needed behavior changes.
Collectively, this process is analogous to steps 3 –5i n
our process (Fig. 1). The application of the COM-B
model, and subsequently the TDF to add greater specifi-
city, mitigated the potential for an overly narrow focus
that may arise in selecting and applying a single behav-
ioral or behavior change theory to a complex behavior
change problem [ 42,58,59]. Following detailed specifi-
cation of the behaviors that required change, relevant
and appropriate intervention functions were mapped to
behavior change techniques to support development of
intervention activities (i.e., steps 6 and 7, Fig. 1). While
the BCW is a relatively new framework for intervention
design, it has been used to characterize behavioral prob-
lems and develop interventions targeting both individ-
ual- and population-level health outcomes in the fields
of mental health, nutrition and physical activity, smoking
cessation, and improving provision of care by physicians
and nurses [ 36]. While the bulk of BCW applications are
in developed countries, examples exist from Thailand
[87] and Kenya [ 88].
Many interventions in low- and middle-income coun-
tries targeting WASH and nutrition are criticized for
their limited application of contextually grounded behav-
ior change theories or inappropriate use of a single the-
ory in intervention design [ 74]. Use of the BCW helpsavoid these pitfalls through the use of context, most not-
ably the social and environmental opportunities domain
of the COM-B model, as a starting point and the inte-
gration of multiple behavior change theories to inform
intervention design.
To be impactful, research suggests that interventions
should focus intensively on a few key behaviors, integrate
these into familiar routines, and appeal not only to early
adopters, but also laggards and late adopters [ 26,36,74].
Through our intervention development process, we iden-
tified three intervention packages that were thematically
coherent; each package focused on a series of behavior
change activities that collectively served to motivate adop-
tion of a set of thematically linked behaviors. The priori-
tized behaviors were grouped in ways that integrated into
daily household routines, based either on performance at
similar times of day or in similar locations. This routine-
focused approach differs from the traditional siloing of
WASH and nutrition messages based on behavioral out-
comes. For example, messages around washing hands
before eating were paired with mealtime behaviors, not
other handwashing behaviors. Our approach allowed us to
integrate multiple layers of intervention functions to
reinforce behavior adoption and maintenance.
We used an adapted TIPs [ 47] approach to test the
feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of the
components of the intervention packages prior to larger
scale testing. Through TIPs, we found that such thematic
packaging enabled adoption of behaviors. However, the

motivation behavioral model; TIPs Trials of improved practicesJacob Arriola et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:10 Page 12 of 16
short duration and small sample of TIPs precluded us
from examining behavior maintenance over a sustained
period or assessing intervention outcomes.
TOCs, developed in the tradition of theory-driven
evaluation, describe the underlying assumptions and hy-
pothesized pathways by which programs achieve im-
pacts —the how and the why of program impact. TOCs
have multiple uses in the program life cycle but are often
underutilized in program design and implementation
[28]. Similarly, few programs describe in detail the
process used to create their TOC. We adapted an exist-
ing framework and process for TOC development [ 35]
and used a systematic behavioral mapping approach [ 36]
to articulate rationales for our pathways to change (rec-
ommendation 4), although these methods could be ap-
plied to a range of different types of programs. TOCs
can be used as “living ”tools that adapt in response to
lessons learned over the implementation period. In this
project, TIPs served as a precursor to this adaptation
process. As we have scaled the finalized intervention
packages for larger implementation and testing, we have
continued to revisit the TOC.
We recognized that stakeholder engagement in all
aspects of our intervention development process would
be crucial to ensure the intervention packages would be
relevant and realistic to integrate into existing program
context, sustainable and scalable. We sought a variety of
relevant stakeholder perspectives that included topical
(WASH, nutrition, behavior change), programmatic
(country director, monitoring and evaluation experts,
program managers), and contextual (local academic
partner, local partner organizations) expertise and expe-
riences. Stakeholders were engaged through participa-
tory workshops, monthly conference calls, and feedback
integration at each stage of the process. While some
activities were inherently collaborative in nature, others
more closely resembled a system of product review,
provision of feedback, and subsequent revision. Applying
stakeholder feedback to the development of interven-
tions in other areas would likely involve other differ-
ences in how stakeholders are engaged.
Strengths, limitations, and challenges
Our intervention design process had several limitations
worth noting. First, the process of finalizing the behav-
iors to focus on was iterative, which is both a strength
and a limitation. As a strength, it allowed for the voices
of relevant stakeholders to be taken into consideration.
But as a limitation, it served as a “constantly moving
target ”; as behaviors were continually refined, so too did
the need to refine the foundational work (i.e., the prob-
lem and solution trees), the intervention functions, and
even the intervention plan.Second, we deliberately developed this intervention
within the context of the Care Group model. Though it
enhanced the potential for scale, this decision limited
the nature of the intervention activities as this model
targets individual- and/or community-level behaviors
(versus policy or physical structures). Adherence to these
criteria limited our ability to fully elaborate interventions
based on our application of the BCW approach, especially
as they pertain to creating an enabling environment for
change. For example, environmental opportunities that
influence diet practices, such as food accessibility and
affordability, could be enhanced through policy levers in-
cluding for example, subsidies for high-quality foods (i.e.,
a fiscal measure in BCW vernacular) or enhanced agricul-
ture extension (i.e., service provision). Large scale mass
media efforts can effectively shift social norms and behav-
iors [ 32,63,77–79] and may be useful for inculcating and
reinforcing handwashing and feces disposal. Similarly,
platforms that use the education sector to target school-
aged children can shift beliefs, attitudes, and practices in
t h eh o m e[ 89]; however, these were outside the scope of
the THRIVE II delivery platform.
Third, it is unclear the extent to which the interven-
tion that was developed is generalizable beyond western
Kenya. On the one hand, the extensive formative re-
search ensures that the intervention is sensitive to con-
text, but in doing so, it may be less applicable in
contexts outside of this setting. Future work will hope-
fully allow us to test and modify the approach; the
process laid out in this manuscript provides a roadmap.
Finally, examining the approaches as a complete set of
intervention packages masks whether there are subcom-
ponents that are more or less effective at generating be-
havioral change. A dismantling research design in which
individual intervention components are tested separately
(or in subsets) would be needed to more fully answer
this question.
Conclusions
We have outlined our approach to developing a theory-
and evidence-based intervention that integrated a set of
WASH and nutrition behaviors to target growth short-
falls among young children in western Kenya. Interven-
tions, specifically in the WASH and nutrition sectors are
not typically developed in such a prescriptive way, yield-
ing poor sustainability and sub-optimal health gains. An
approach that equally values peer-reviewed evidence and
stakeholder inputs, and that adheres to a structured and
deliberate theory-based process may provide the best op-
portunity to achieve interventions that result in sus-
tained behavior change at scale. We hope that in laying
out this step-by-step process, others may use and modify
our approach to support rigorous program design in a
range of other areas of needed behavior change.Jacob Arriola et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2020) 6:10 Page 13 of 16
