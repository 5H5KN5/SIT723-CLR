Abstract 
Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents are highly prevalent and account for 
more than half of all youth psychiatric disorders. Left untreated, anxiety, and depression lead to numerous detrimental 
outcomes, including reduced quality of life, psychiatric, and somatic comorbidity and even reduced lifespan. This puts 
a large strain on child and adolescent mental healthcare services (CAMHS) to provide effective treatments. However, 
even when provided the best evidence-based treatment, between 40–50% of patients continue to report significant 
symptom burdens. Thus, there is an immediate need for supplemental and/or new treatment approaches. Physi-
cal activity as a supplementary treatment may be such an approach. However, research investigating this approach 
within this population is scant. This protocol paper describes the development and feasibility trial of a physical 
activity-based intervention targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth treated in CAMHS.
Methods/design: The study is based on the UK Medical Council Research Framework (MRC) for developing and 
evaluating complex interventions. Feasibility and acceptability of the physical activity intervention (confident, active, 
and happy youth) will be evaluated in an uncontrolled open-label trial using qualitative and quantitative data. Twenty 
youths with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited. Acceptability of assessment procedures, the inter -
vention, and perceived benefits and barriers to participation will be assessed, and qualitative interviews with partici-
pants, caregivers, and referring specialists will explore contextual and practical factors associated with intervention 
delivery. Physical activity will be measured using the Actigraph GT3X+ monitor at baseline, and post-intervention and 
change in anxiety and depression will be assessed.
Discussion: This study will contribute to the development of supplementary physical treatment interventions for 
youth with anxiety and depression in contact with CAMHS. The goal is to examine new avenues of treatment that 
ultimately may improve upon current treatment outcomes of anxiety and depression. This work will be in preparation 
for a future definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this approach, in line with the MRC Framework.

4.7–9.1) and 2.6% for depressive disorders (CI 95% 
1.7–3.9) [1 , 2]. These disorders tend to develop early 
in life, and short- and long-term consequences include 
reduced quality of life, psychiatric and somatic comor -
bidity, disability, loss of education and/or work, suicide, 
and reduced life-span [3 , 4]. According to the World 
Health Organization, anxiety, and depressive disorders 
are major health problems with large-scale societal and 
economic consequences (WHO, 2017). Anxiety and 
depression are among the top five causes of overall dis -
ease burden among youth in Europe [5 ].
Discouragingly, even when provided the best evi -
dence based treatment, post-treatment remission rates 
for anxiety and depressive disorders in youth are just 
slightly above chance, e.g., 50% (mixed anxiety: 50.7% 
CI 45.3–56.2; depression: 53.2%, CI 34.6–70.9 [6 ]. Such 
suboptimal treatments have adverse consequences for 
the individual, but also place a large strain on treatment 
services, which are dependent upon sufficient capacity 
and effective treatment. If patients do not recover or 
experience relapse following treatment, these patients 
require further treatment, thus excluding new patients 
from gaining access to treatment. In light of the high 
prevalence of these disorders, short- and long-term 
consequences, and the suboptimal effect of current 
treatments, there is a pressing need for development 
of new and supplementary interventions to improve 
recovery rates [6 –8].
In recent years, physical activity has gained traction 
as a promising area in effective mental health treat -
ments [9 , 10], and physical activity is identified as a key 
modifiable factor in people with mental illness [11]. 
Meta-analyses of the effects of physical activity in the 
treatment of anxiety and depression in adult popula -
tions indicate small to moderate effects [12– 14]. This 
knowledge is now implemented in adult depression 
treatment recommendations such as those provided by 
The European Psychiatric Association [15]. The amount 
of research on the topic in paediatrics is substantially 
less [9 , 16]; however, new evidence is starting to accu -
mulate. Three recent meta-analyses investigating the 
effect of physical activity on youth depression found 
small to moderate effects [16– 18]. Studies examin -
ing the effects of physical activity on anxiety disorders 
in youth are even fewer, with only one meta-analysis. 
In this meta-analysis, Carter et  al. (2021) concluded 
that physical activity is potentially effective in reduc -
ing anxiety symptoms within non-clinical populations 
of youth, while evidence within clinical (treatment 
seeking) populations is insufficient to draw any clear 
conclusions. All these recent meta-analyses call for 
well-designed research with youth populations—par -
ticularly clinical youth populations [16– 19].The mechanisms by which physical activity interven -
tions impact anxiety and depression are complex and 
multifaceted [20]. Limitations of previous research 
and/or mixed results have hampered attempts to tease 
out the specific intervention mechanisms required to 
cause change. However, the key recent meta-analyses 
do point to a few common ingredients across the inter -
vention studies which had positive effects. These ingre -
dients included supervised, aerobic-, and group-based 
activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, with par -
ticipants engaging in activities multiple times per week 
over a time period of at least 6 to 8 weeks [16– 19]. 
Questions concerning optimum dosage, type of activity, 
and energy expenditure are still unclear.
Focusing on the more specific mechanisms of effect 
of physical activity on anxiety and depression in youth, 
several biological, psychosocial, and behavioral fac -
tors are likely to be involved. Neurobiological mecha -
nisms may include processes that are disrupted or 
dysregulated and potentially modulated by physical 
activity. Processes may include inflammatory and oxi -
dative stress responses, neurogenesis, modulation of 
monoamines (e.g., serotonin), and HPA axis regulation 
[21, 22]. Hillman et al. found that a program targeting 
cardiorespiratory fitness resulted in increased neural 
underpinnings of attentional resources on tasks requir -
ing improved inhibition and cognitive flexibility [23]. 
Deficits in inhibition and cognitive control are associ -
ated strongly with anxiety and depression in youth [24].
In regards to psychosocial processes, physical activ -
ity can increase opportunities for social interaction, 
social connectedness, and experiences of mastery and 
can lead to increased self-efficacy and independence 
[20, 25]. Problems and deficits within these areas are 
closely associated with anxiety and depression in youth 
[26, 27]. Exposure therapy is the treatment of choice 
for anxiety disorders in youth [6 ]. Similarly, physical 
activity is also assumed to affect anxiety and depres -
sion through exposure towards an avoided object and/
or situation, i.e., physical activity itself induces bodily 
sensations and reactions that otherwise might be inter -
preted as symptoms of anxiety and/or be negatively 
appraised. Exposure to such sensations and reactions in 
this setting is thus assumed to be associated with non-
threatening experiences, leading to normalization of 
such experiences and a more appropriate interpretation 
of these (Kandola et al. 2018).
In terms of behavioral mechanisms, physical activity 
may improve sleep, self-regulation, and coping skills 
[20]. The interplay of the mechanisms described above 
is most likely also highly idiosyncratic to the individual, 
based on their prior beliefs and experiences of physical 
activity.

Development of a supplementary intervention
The development of a supplementary physical activ -
ity intervention took place in the Child and Adolescent 
Mental Health Services, Haukeland University Hospital, 
Bergen, Norway, from 2018 to 2020. A work and man -
agement group consisting of clinicians and researchers, 
and a trial steering committee consisting of stakeholders, 
clinicians, users, and parents identified key intervention 
components and a suitable delivery format. In addition, 
the group identified and outlined necessary organiza -
tional infrastructure, internal work procedures, and team 
composition in order to deliver the treatments effectively.
The target goals of the program link closely to interre -
lated core symptoms of anxiety and depression: reduced 
or low levels of physical activity [28], lack of confidence 
in one’s ability to cope with situations that incites dis -
tress and/or fear, and decreased willingness to engage in 
and avoidance of situations that may incite distress and/
or fear [27, 29]. Finally, a core symptom particularly with 
depression is lowered mood. Taken together, the primary 
aim of the intervention is to alleviate these core symp -
toms and supplement ongoing treatment in CAMHS, 
which translates to helping youth become more confi -
dent, active, and happy, hence the name of the interven -
tion: Confident, Active and Happy Youth (CAH-Y).
The primary aims of the intervention are as follows:
– Help youth become more confident, more happy and 
more physically active.
– Reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Secondary aims of the CAH-Y intervention are as 
follows:
• To motivate and support youths with anxiety/depres -
sion symptoms to initiate and maintain an active life -
style and reduce sedentary behavior.
• To help foster integration of physical activity into 
current treatment approaches for internalizing disor -
ders in youth in treatment in CAMHS.
While the effects of the physical activity itself are 
important and required in the intervention, there is 
also a need to address underlying reasons why youth 
with anxiety and depression avoid and/or have diffi -
culty doing physical activity. To this end, the CAH-Y 
intervention draws on Self Determination Theory [25] 
and Inhibitory Learning Theory [30]. Self Determina -
tion Theory provides a framework with which to under -
stand participant experiences with physical activity and 
their motivation (as opposed to avoidance) towards 
physical activity. The framework focuses on ways to enhance learning and intrinsic motivation concern -
ing both increased activity and behavior and symp -
tom change [25]. More specifically, the intervention 
attempts to satisfy youths’ basic psychological needs for 
autonomy (e.g., providing youth with choice), compe -
tence (e.g., adapting exercises to meet the needs/fitness 
levels of students), and relatedness (e.g., promoting an 
inclusive group environment). Inhibitory learning the -
ory provides a generic framework to understand the bi-
directional interaction between cognition, affects, and 
behavior in regards to anxiety and depression; in par -
ticular the role of physical activity avoidance as a cop -
ing and affect-regulation strategy that both causes and 
maintains these disorders [30].
Drawing together these theories and known compo -
nents, a treatment manual was developed detailing a 
supervised, therapist-led, group-based physical activity 
programme involving aerobic exercise bi-weekly over 
a course of 7 weeks. Further details on the interven -
tion are detailed below in the intervention section. The 
full treatment manual (in Norwegian) is available on 
request by contacting the corresponding author.
In line with guidance from the UK Medical Council 
Research Framework (MRC) [31], the present study is 
an initial step in determining if the developed interven -
tion is feasible and acceptable for youth with internaliz -
ing disorders in CAMHS. A mixed-methods approach 
was chosen to explore indications of participants’ 
response and view to the intervention and thereby gain 
a more full understanding of the intervention accepta -
bility [32]. The present study also includes a calculation 
of effect size estimates for outcome measures to esti -
mate the sample size of a future “definitive” randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) as defined by the UK MRC.
The principal aims of this study are as follows:
1. To quantify recruitment rate, willingness to partici -
pate, attendance, treatment retention, and adherence
2. To assess the appropriateness and practicality of the 
designed intervention in the proposed settings
3. To determine the acceptability of recruitment strate -
gies and the intervention by participants and willing -
ness to participate
4. To assess the appropriateness and acceptability of the 
assessment tools
5. To provide preliminary evidence of effects of the 
intervention on physical activity, mood, and anx -
iousness. This evidence will provide an initial indi -
cation of whether the intervention can contribute to 
change within this group. Estimated effect sizes will 
provide the parameters for a definitive randomized 
controlled trial.

Methods and design
This protocol conforms to guidelines presented in the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 
[33] 2010 statement extension for randomized feasibil -
ity studies and clinical trial protocols (see Additional file: 
Table S1 ). The intervention component is an uncontrolled 
open-label feasibility trial (hereafter referred to as “the 
intervention”), utilizing a pre-test–post-test within-sub -
ject design. The overall study design is illustrated in Fig.  1 
(below), whereas the stages of the enrollment, interven -
tions, and assessments Table 1  below (The SPIRIT table).
Spirit table
Intervention (CAH‑Y)
The CAH-Y intervention includes two sessions of 50 min 
per week, for 7 weeks, in total 14 sessions. However, the final session is approximately 3-h long since it includes 
a nature hike and a conclusion of the program. Several 
constraints shaped the delivery format in the form of 
intervention length, intensity, and overall dosage. Thus, 
the delivery format is a compromise between evidence 
from behavior change research, organizational consid -
erations, and clinical considerations regarding the logisti -
cal and practical burden on youth and parents (e.g., time 
spent to commute to treatment, time away from school). 
Importantly, despite these constraints the intended dose 
of the intended active mechanisms is still likely to be suf -
ficient to have effect (e.g., moderate to vigorous activity, 
inhibitory learning, building motivation).
The intervention is group-based with up to eight par -
ticipants in each group. Two therapists lead each group. 
Groups are divided into a child group and an adolescent Fig. 1 Study flow chart for CAH-Y feasibility study. CAH-Y Confident, Active and Happy Youth, NML-C Nijmegen Motivation List for Chldren, SCAS-C/P

group to accommodate maturational differences. Youth 
aged 8–13 receive the child intervention, whereas youth 
aged 14–18 receive the adolescent version. Both versions 
follow the same format and structure and have the same 
guiding principles and goals. However, the specific activi -
ties in CAH-Y 13 and CAH-Y 18 are tailored to the meet 
the maturational level and interests of the different age 
groups.
Each session follows the same structure and format 
(with exception of the last session as noted above). This 
structure consists of the following: an introduction and 
warm-up (10 min), main activity (35 min), and a ses -
sion wrap-up (5 min). The separate sessions have distinct 
overarching topics and include a variety of activities. Ses -
sions take place in a gym hall, two sessions involve activi -
ties in a swimming pool, and the last session is outside.
Concerning the more specific physical activities in the 
intervention, sessions include a mix of aerobic (e.g., run -
ning, jumping, traversing an obstacle course), resistance 
(e.g., squats, push-ups), and relaxation exercises (e.g., 
yoga exercises). The goal for each session is a minimum 
of 30 min spent in moderate to vigorous intensity activity.
Specifically during the introduction and warm-
up, the therapists give psychoeducation to the 
youth regarding the bidirectional interplay between 
thoughts, feelings, actions, and particularly the role 
of avoidance and alternative coping strategies. The 
exercises are designed to stimulate some distress, fear, and/or discomfort, and the therapists couple these 
feelings and reactions to the introductory psychoe -
ducation and use the exercises as exposure therapy. A 
supportive and mastery motivational climate facilitates 
the individuals need for relatedness [25] and a safe 
space to practice exposure (being observed), provides 
an optimal environment to help the youth address, 
and overcome this fear [34]. Thus, the group format 
allows youth to observe other youth, allowing them to 
observe that other youth have similar feelings, fears, 
reactions, behaviors, and responses as themselves, e.g., 
we sweat when we are physically active, trying out new 
activities may make us feel anxious but can be done 
nonetheless. Gaining this knowledge can help normal -
ize the youth’s understanding of both themselves and 
others. Importantly, group and peer support are iden -
tified as an important intervention component to sup -
port active lifestyles [35, 36].
In accordance with self-determination theory, the 
sessions also strive to satisfy the youths’ needs for 
autonomy (e.g., giving them choices within a menu of 
activities to do), competence (e.g., adapting exercises 
to meet the needs/fitness levels of students), and relat -
edness (e.g., focusing on group cohesion, group coop -
eration). Importantly in this regard, the sessions do 
not have a competitive focus, but focus on being sup -
portive, enjoyable, and fun. An overview of the CAH-Y 
intervention is presented in Table 2 .Table 1 SPIRIT table for an uncontrolled open-label feasibility testing of physical activity intervention: Confident, Active and Happy

Therapists
Group-leaders will have knowledge of mental health dis -
orders, youth development, group-dynamics, and physical 
activity to adequately understand and be able to meet the 
needs of the youth. Thus, a complementary team consist -
ing of mental health nurse and a youth physiotherapist was 
recommended by the steering committee, to lead the inter -
vention sessions. Additionally, the need to be able to rap -
idly address and intervene if youths experience discomfort 
or need adjustments to activities while still instructing the 
other youth, mean that at least two therapists are needed 
per session.
Study population and eligibility
Youth are referred to the treatment program from their 
attending therapist at the local CAMHS. Youth can be 
included in the study if they meet the criteria below.
Inclusion criteria are as follows:
• Age 8–17 years
• Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression
• Youth display reduced daily physical activity (less than 
30 mins per day and/or does not partake in physical 
leisure activities, and/or does not participate in physi -
cal education in school).
• The youth is motivated to partake in physical activity
Exclusion criteria are as follows:
• Physical activity is not advised for medical reasons
• Severe learning disabilities and the youth is unable to 
understand the study protocol
• Specific psychiatric disorders including any eating dis -
order, psychosis
• Severe challenging behavior or other needs requiring 
constant one to one supportRecruitment
Youth will be recruited from the CAMHS, Department 
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Haukeland Uni -
versity Hospital, Norway. CAMHS is organized at the 
same intervention level as ordinary hospital services 
(Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway) and 
is as such a tertiary specialized service. In the Norwe -
gian context, this is the primary source of treatment for 
youth with mental health disorders. CAMHS is organ -
ized in three inpatient wards, three specialized clin -
ics, and seven outpatient clinics. These units together 
form the recruitment base for CAH-Y. CAMHS offers 
all forms of mental health services to youth in a catch -
ment area of app. 460,000 citizens in total. The CAMHS 
receives approximately 3000 referrals per year and 
delivers treatment to 5.2% of all youth in the catchment 
area [37]. Taking into account CAH-Y inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, we estimate that 40% of these youth 
qualify for participation in the intervention (n  = 600). 
The likely numbers of patients referred and eligible 
should greatly exceed the numbers required by the fea -
sibility study, meaning well below 10% of those eligible 
are required to consent.
Given that CAH-Y is organized within CAMHS, this 
enables easy access to potential participants and stream -
lined recruitment strategies. In practice, this translates 
into the following:
– Uncomplicated dispersion of information regard -
ing the intervention to the departments and mental 
health professionals via intranet, email and/or physi -
cal/digital meetings
– Ease of implementing an in-house digital referral 
system
– A low threshold for communication between the 
CAH-Y team and the referring specialist
Based on the therapist’s assessment of eligibility and 
participant’s interest in the intervention, the thera -
pist sends a formal referral to the CAH-Y team. The Table 2 Description of the intended structure and format of Confident, Active and Happy Youth program. Notes: Pa  physical activity

referrals are assessed with respect to inclusion/exclu -
sion criteria by the Principal Investigator (PI is the first 
author). If the youth is assessed eligible, an invitation to 
attend a recruitment and inclusion interview is sent to 
the youth (and parents if the youth is below 16 years of 
age). Enclosed in the letter are also a number of health 
assessment questionnaires. The questionnaires assess 
mood, anxiety, demographic information, and motivation 
to attend the intervention. Finally, this letter informs of 
a webpage address, where the participant can find more 
information about the intervention and the study. The 
referring specialist will receive notification that the youth 
is eligible and is invited to an interview. Approximately a 
week prior to the interview, youth/parents are contacted 
via phone and they are given further information about 
the intervention and study participation.
Consent
At the recruitment and inclusion interview, participants 
are provided further information about the intervention 
and the study, and any ensuing questions can be dealt 
with. Written information detailing the intervention, 
the study as well as the consent form are reviewed with 
the participant and/or parents if they participate in the 
interview. Informed written consent is obtained from 
all parents, and assent is obtained from youth above age 
12 years. All participants in the intervention fill out the 
same questionnaires and go through the same assessment 
interview. Importantly, participation in the study requires 
written consent, but participation in the intervention is 
not dependent on participation in the study.
Withdrawal of the study participants
At any time, participants can withdraw consent with no 
consequences for further intervention participation or 
other eventual benefits. If there are any serious adverse 
events, e.g., injury from the activities, details will be 
recorded and reported to the PI and to the work manage -
ment group. CAMHS has appropriate insurance of the 
participants, if any adverse event should take place. In 
the case of adverse psychiatric effects are uncovered, this 
will be reported immediately to the participants referring 
specialist in CAMHS.
Feasibility procedures
After referral assessment of eligibility, eligible youth 
and their primary caregivers are invited to attend a 
recruitment and inclusion interview. This interview 
will take place in the CAH-Y facilities. In the interview, 
therapists will provide further information about the intervention and study details, clarifying any questions 
and/or concerns, and obtaining written consent, and 
they collect and check the questionnaires included in 
the invitation for the recruitment interview. Moreover, 
additional questionnaires will be completed (see pri -
mary and secondary outcome measures section below), 
medical information gathered (height and weight), 
and participants will be provided an Actigraph activ -
ity monitor to be worn for the next 7 days. In addition, 
a short qualitative interview exploring participant and 
caregiver views on physical activity will be conducted. 
Finally, the youth and caregivers will be given a tour of 
the CAH-Y facilities in order to familiarize them with 
the setting.
The first session of the CAH-Y program will be 
between one to a maximum of 3 weeks after the inter -
view. At this point, they will also return the Actigraph 
monitors and activity diaries. The intervention will then 
start. The day before every session, the participants will 
receive a SMS reminder of the session. After each ses -
sion, participants are encouraged to visit a designated 
webpage for the program, where they can find further 
information about the next session. This is in order to 
remind the participants of the session clarify what is 
expected and encourage participation.
Following the last session of the intervention, par -
ticipants will receive an invitation to attend a post-
intervention interview, one to a maximum of 3 weeks 
following last intervention session. In this interview, 
questionnaires relating to symptom change will be 
completed, and biometric data will be gathered and 
a short qualitative interview exploring the views of 
the participant and his/her caregivers in relation to 
the intervention will be done. At the end of the inter -
view, participants will be provided an Actigraph activ -
ity monitor to be worn for the next 7 days. After these 
seven days have elapsed, a research assistant will gather 
the Actigraph. Independently of this assessment with 
the participant, a short qualitative interview with the 
referring specialist will also be conducted by the PI.
At 6 months post-intervention, the participants and 
their caregivers will be invited to attend a follow-up 
interview. In this interview, questionnaires relating to 
initial symptoms will be completed, and a new short 
qualitative interview exploring views possible negative 
and/or positive effects of the intervention will be con -
ducted. At the end of this interview, participants will 
be provided an Actigraph activity monitor to be worn 
for the next 7 days. After this time-period, the Acti -
graph will gathered by a research assistant. See Fig.  1 
for study flow chart.

Comparison group
Participants will serve as their own controls. Pre- and 
post-treatment results will be compared to inform a 
future power calculation.
Measures
Apart from the measures that participants and their car -
egivers fill out at home [SCAS, SMFQ, demographics], all 
other measures and assessments will be conducted in the 
CAH-Y facilities.
Socio -demographic characteristics and psychiatric 
conditions
Primary caregivers will provide socio-demographic infor -
mation. The PI will acquire psychiatric/medical informa -
tion, via the participant’s digital medical records. Axis-1 
diagnoses are given during ordinary clinical practice by 
the youth’s psychiatrist or psychologist after reaching a 
consensus with other professionals from the multi-dis -
ciplinary team. In this study, we will classify the patients 
according to their main Axis I psychiatric diagnoses 
(ICD-10 codes are specified in Table  2) in the following 
groups: depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, hyperki -
netic disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, and 
other disorders (a broad spectrum of psychiatric disor -
ders with low frequency). The assessment and diagnosis 
of youth in CAMHS will provide the necessary informa -
tion in order to asses study eligibility according to the 
predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Feasibility outcomes
Feasibility of the trial will be done by way of continu -
ous tracking of participant recruitment (number of 
youth referred/number of the youth assessed as eligi -
ble), attendance, and retention. The appropriateness, 
practicality, and acceptability of the intervention within 
the CAMHS setting, will be explored through feedback 
from participants, primary caregivers, and the referring 
specialists. This information will be gathered via semi-
structured qualitative interviews, during the pre- and 
post-treatment assessment, while the referring specialists 
will be interviewed separately following the post-treat -
ment assessment. Furthermore, the researchers will meet 
with the steering group at the end of the study to discuss 
the results and intervention acceptability.
Participant -centered outcome measures
Objective measures of physical activity will be collected 
using the wearable activity sensor Actigraph GT3X+ 
monitor. The sensor captures and records continu -
ous, high-resolution physical activity, and sleep/wake 
information and can record daily time spent in seden -
tary, light, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Other research has documented this method 
to be valid and reliable [38]. Pre-defined minimum wear 
time for a valid day will be defined as 6 h per day with a 
minimum of 3 days of data required for analysis inclu -
sion [39]. Data for the Actigraph will be downloaded 
using Actigraph Actilife software and interpreted using 
30-s epochs and the following cut-off points: seden -
tary (<100 cpm) and MVPA (≥ 3200cpm) [40]. Non-
wear time will be defined as 60 min of consecutive zero 
counts. Participants will also be asked to wear the Acti -
graph during each intervention session to provide data 
on physical activity and MVPA content of the sessions.
Participant height will be measured in meters and 
rounded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Weight will be measured 
in kilograms and rounded to the nearest 0.1kg.
Anxiety symptoms will be assessed using Spence Child 
Anxiety Scale, child, and parent version (SCAS-C/P) 
(Spence, 1998). The SCAS comprises 38 items rated on 
a 4-point scale (0 =  never, 1 =  sometimes, 2 =  often, 3 
= always), with a maximum score of 114. SCAS-C/P has 
demonstrated good psychometric qualities [41].
Affective symptoms will be assessed using Short Mood 
and Feelings Questionnaire, and child and parent version 
(SMFQ-C/P) (Angold, Costello, Messer, & Pickles, 1995) 
is used to assess youth affective symptoms. The SMFQ 
has demonstrated good psychometric qualities [42].
Intervention motivation will be assessed using 
Nijmegen Motivation List Child (NML-C) [43]. This is 
used widely to assess treatment motivation in children 
and adolescents. The NML-C comprises 15 items rated 
on a 3-point scale.
The semi-structured qualitative interview will apart 
from feasibility outcomes also assess participant percep -
tions on PA in general, participant views on the asso -
ciation between PA and mental health, perceptions on 
the intervention components and the intervention as 
a whole, views on potential barriers to physical activity, 
motivation for activity, and participation in school-based 
physical activity. These questions will be posed at post-
treatment and long-term follow-up. Caregivers will be 
posed the same questions; however, caregivers of youth 
aged 12 years or above will only receive these questions 
if the youth has consented to this. Answers to the ques -
tions are written down during the interviews and will be 
analyzed by thematic analysis [44]. An interview with the 
referring specialist, following the post-treatment inter -
view with the participant, will similarly explore his/her 
experiences of the intervention including acceptability of 
procedures, perceived benefits, and difficulties.
An effect-size will be calculated for youth and caregiver 
reported depression and anxiety symptoms and activity 
level. Means (M) and standard deviations (SD ) will be 
used to investigate the effect sizes for change between 
Page 9 of 12
 Kodal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:48 
 
pre- to post-treatment. These results will help inform the 
power calculation of the likely required sample size for a 
future large-scale RCT.
Timing
Measures will be assessed at baseline (pre-intervention 
interview) and at the latest 2 weeks after completing 
the intervention. Follow-up outcome will be assessed 6 
months post-intervention.
Sample size
As this will be the feasibility study to inform the design 
of the future definitive RCT, a target sample of 20 youth 
participants will be recruited for a mixed-methods 
assessment of feasibility [45].
Progression criteria
A feasibility study is not adequately powered to test the 
any hypothesis (e.g., the efficacy of CAH-Y physical activ -
ity intervention) but is intended to improve the chances 
of conducting a high-quality RCT. Therefore, in line with 
suggestions by el-Kotob et  al. [46], a priori criteria for 
progression to the definitive large-scale RCT are advis -
able. The progression criteria to move on to a definitive 
large-scale RCT will be as follows: (A) no serious adverse 
events, such as hospitalization, a life-threatening condi -
tion, death, and any adverse events associated with the 
intervention; (B) recruitment rate of no less than 75%; 
and (C) retention rate of no less than 60% in each group 
at 7 weeks (total of 14 sessions). If all the three criteria 
are not met, we assess there is insufficient evidence to 
justify proceeding to the definitive RCT. Consequently, 
changes to the intervention would then be required with 
consequent re-runs of the intervention following, up 
until these criteria are met.
Statistics and data analysis
Quantitative data will be analyzed using SPSS version 
22.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Baseline data for participants will also be presented in 
charts as well as any possible participant missing data 
(questionnaires and Actigraph). Descriptive data will 
use 95% confidence intervals (mean and standard devia -
tions). Baseline differences between groups (e.g., age, 
activity level, BMI, number of mental health disorders, 
and questionnaire outcomes) will be analyzed using 
one-way ANOVA. Nominal data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, 
social class, participation in school physical activity) will 
be analyzed using chi-square analyses. However, as men -
tioned, the feasibility study is underpowered to detect 
any effects reliably. Thus, quantitative feasibility out -
comes will be interpreted only as feasibility and pilot data 
due to lack of statistical power.Qualitative interviews with participants, caregiv -
ers and referring specialists will be analyzed utilizing 
thematic analysis [44]. Accordingly, the interview data 
will be reviewed for data familiarization; initial codes 
will be generated, followed by organizing codes into 
themes, refining themes, and finally defining themes and 
sub-themes.
Possible harms
Potential harms of being involved in the intervention, 
and the assessments will be explicitly outlined in the 
participant explanatory statements and consent form. 
During assessment, the primary potential risk for partici -
pants may be to experience some psychological distress; 
however, this is not anticipated to exceed levels of psy -
chological distress experienced previously in CAMHS 
or in their daily lives. During the intervention, the youth 
are expected to engage in physical activity with vary -
ing degrees of activity intensity. During such activities, 
the youth could potentially injure themselves or others 
physically, and/or they could experience some physio-
psychological distress. All activities required in the inter -
vention are preplanned and will be completed so as be to 
be as safe as possible, yet any movement (in a group) does 
necessarily entail some risk of injury. All accidents and 
injuries will be recorded and reported to the PI and the 
work management group. In addition, any adverse events 
or mental states observed among the participants (e.g., 
significant symptom deterioration, suicidal ideation or 
suicide attempt, reported or observed abuse and/or self-
harm, excessive weight loss) will be monitored routinely 
throughout the study. Any such adverse events will be 
immediately reported back to the youth’s referring spe -
cialist, who is responsible for the youth’s mental health 
care. All study therapists and interviewers are experi -
enced in working with youth with anxiety and depression 
and in responding to distress.
Discussion
The aim of the current study is to develop and feasibility 
test a supplemental physical activity program for youth 
with internalizing disorders in regular treatment in child 
and adolescent mental health clinics (CAMHS). In light 
of high prevalence of anxiety and depression among chil -
dren and adolescents, negative short- and long-term con -
sequences, poor recovery rates even when provided best 
available treatment, there is an urgent need for new and/
or supplemental treatment approaches. Physical activity 
may be one such approach. While the effects of physical 
activity on internalizing disorders in adults are to some 
degree empirically underpinned, the benefits, and sup -
plemental treatment effects PA may have for youth are 
only just beginning to evolve. Thus, there exists a clear 
Page 10 of 12 Kodal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2022) 8:48 
evidence gap in regards to the effects of PA on youth 
internalizing disorders and the integration of such an 
approach in CAMHS. A necessary first step in develop -
ing this field and addressing this knowledge gap is devel -
oping and feasibility testing a theoretically based physical 
activity-based intervention targeting anxiety and depres -
sive symptoms in youth. This may be an important step 
towards addressing the burden and consequences these 
mental health disorders cause youth and to help provide 
more effective treatment.
We anticipate that participation in the intervention will 
result in increases in physical activity from pre- to post-
treatment. Similarly, we also expect some improvements 
in anxiety and depressive symptomatology from pre- to 
post-treatment. These anticipated changes are hypoth -
esized to map onto positive changes in youth confidence, 
mood, and physical activity. Concerning feasibility test -
ing, we expect that feasibility estimates for recruitment, 
completion, and retention will be met, and results of out -
come measures will enable an effect-size estimation for 
future RCT planning. It is anticipated that youth, parents, 
and referring specialists will find the intervention accept -
able. The qualitative component will provide a unique 
opportunity to gain a rich perspective of the youths and 
parents experience and acceptability, which is essential 
towards future evaluation of the CAH-Y intervention.
Limitations of the research
As this is a small-scale feasibility study with no control 
group, it is not possible to secure blinding throughout the 
study. Two therapists provide the recruitment and inclu -
sion assessment interviews and deliver the intervention. 
However, some of the post-intervention assessments 
will be done by the study PI as well as the interview with 
the referring specialist and follow-up interview. Whilst 
a double-blind feasibility design would strengthen the 
study, time, and resources are limited and do not allow 
for this. However, in the next steps of the development 
of the intervention (in line with the MRC Framework); 
including a pilot RCT and the definitive RCT, necessary 
personnel to avoid bias in the trial will be secured.
Strength of the research
The current study presents a number of strengths. 
Firstly, a major strength of the study is its alignment 
with the MRC Framework for the development of 
complex health interventions. The findings from this 
study are critical to the next stages of the MRC Frame -
work: development and implementation of a definitive 
RCT exploring the effectiveness of physical activity as 
a supplemental treatment for youth with internalizing 
disorders in CAMHS. Secondly, a major strength of 
the study is a high degree of “real-world” or external validity. Many treatment development studies are based 
in university settings or specialized clinics and lead on 
to efficacy studies. The current study will both develop 
and aims to test effectiveness in a community setting in 
the longer-term, thus increasing is applicability in real-
life settings and potentially bypassing any limitations 
and issues in generalizability from specialized to com -
munity clinic.
Thirdly, the target population for the intervention is a 
youth population which is especially susceptible to high 
levels of sedentary time and low levels of physical activ -
ity. Thus, this is a vulnerable target population in which 
changes in physical activity level can have a major impact 
both short-term and in regards to long-term health out -
comes. Given that participants will give consent for 
access to medical journals, this will provide valuable 
insight into how comorbid illness influences feasibil -
ity, but also co-morbidity may be affected by the CAH-Y 
intervention.
Trial status
The study is currently in progress, and participants are 
being assessed for eligibility and inclusion into the fea -
sibility trial. Inclusion started in April 2020 and will 
continue until the target number of participants is 
included, likely before the end of 2021. Results from the 
study will be submitted for publication in the second 
quarter of 2022.
