Abstract 
Background Non‑memory‑led dementias such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), primary progressive apha‑
sia (PPA) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are low prevalent and often affect individuals 
under the age of 65. Tailored educational and support resources for caregivers of people living with these dementia 
phenotypes are scarce and unevenly distributed geographically. Web ‑based educational programmes are emerging 
as promising alternatives to improve caregiver self‑ efficacy and well‑being. Here, we present the protocol of a study 
aiming to assess the feasibility of a co ‑produced online educational programme for caregivers of people living PCA, 
PPA and bvFTD: the Better Living with Non‑memory‑led Dementia programme.
Methods A randomised controlled feasibility trial will be conducted on a sample of 30 caregivers of people living 
with PCA, PPA and bvFTD. Participants will be recruited among members of the support organisation Rare Dementia 
Support (based at UCL in the UK). The intervention group will be given access to an 8‑ week co ‑produced web ‑based 
educational programme consisting of 6 modules addressing education about PCA, PPA and bvFTD and support 
strategies for the person with dementia and for the caregiver. The control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU). 
Feasibility will be measured through feasibility of recruitment, clinical measurement tools and acceptability. Clinical 
measures will be used to assess preliminary efficacy and data on completion rates, missing data and variability used 
to decide on measures to be included in a full‑scale trial.
Allocation ratio will be 2:1 (intervention:control) stratified by diagnosis. Feasibility of recruitment and acceptability 
will be assessed. Clinical measures will be administered at baseline and 8‑ week and 3‑month post ‑randomisation. 
The control group will be offered access to the intervention at the completion of data collection. Participants will be 
unblinded, and all measures will be self‑reported online.
Discussion Online ‑delivered educational programmes show potential for improving care competency of caregivers 
and may contribute to overcoming geographical inequalities in local provision of support services. This pilot study

Background
Around 48 million people worldwide [1] live with demen -
tia, of whom 3.9 million start with symptoms before the 
age of 65 (young-onset dementia) [2]. Most of the peo -
ple presenting with young-onset dementia and some 
people with later onset dementia develop non-memory-
led dementias such as the atypical forms of Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) [3, 4] or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
[5]. Atypical non-memory presentations of AD involve 
visuospatial and language dysfunction as the main clini -
cal manifestations at onset and, more rarely, executive or 
motor dysfunction [6–8]. The two most common atypical 
presentations of AD are posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) 
[9, 10], characterised by progressive deterioration of visu -
ospatial and other posterior functions, and the logopenic 
variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) [11], 
characterised by a pattern of progressive language dete -
rioration with impaired repetition and phonologic errors. 
FTD is an umbrella term that encompasses a group of 
clinical syndromes including the behavioural variant 
(bvFTD) [12] presenting with behavioural (e.g. disinhibi -
tion, apathy) and cognitive symptoms (typically executive 
and social cognition dysfunction), the non-fluent vari -
ant of primary progressive aphasia (nfPPA) [11] where 
individuals affected show non-fluent speech and agram -
matism and the semantic variant of PPA (svPPA) [11] 
characterised by fluent speech in the context of semantic 
knowledge breakdown.
Online interventions for caregivers
Low caregiving competency is associated with lower 
quality of life in the person with dementia [13] and with 
the likelihood of being admitted to a long-term care facil -
ity [14]. A decreased sense of competency is also asso -
ciated with feelings of hopelessness and lower mood in 
caregivers [15]. Despite the proven benefits of educa -
tional programmes and skill training for caregivers, fami -
lies of people with non-memory-led dementias encounter 
fewer opportunities to receive this type of support. This 
is a significant gap in care considering that many peo -
ple with young-onset non-memory-led dementia are in 
their 50s or early 60s, which carries additional challenges 
about employment, financial stability and childcare 
responsibilities [16–18]. Finding suitable information and resources is less likely due to the lower prevalence 
of these phenotypes, their consequent geographical 
spread and their atypical symptoms [19, 20]. Caregiver’s 
demands for more phenotype-specific support suggest 
that tailored provision of education and training is a gap 
in the provision of care in these types of dementia.
A previous clinical trial testing, a web-based blended 
care self-management programme [21], showed improve -
ments in self-efficacy, mastery and quality of life in car -
egivers of people with dementia. Caregivers enrolled in 
this intervention receive personal online coaching from 
a trained healthcare professional, whilst they follow four 
self-chosen thematic modules including psychoeduca -
tion. Coaches spend around 6 h during 8 weeks super -
vising caregivers using the programme. This programme 
has been subsequently adapted to support caregivers of 
people with young onset and frontotemporal dementia 
[22–24]. The effectiveness of these modified versions has 
not been tested yet in a randomised clinical trial (RCT). 
Moreover, web-based psychoeducational programmes 
that require trained healthcare professionals to be deliv -
ered (as it is the case with the aforementioned) are costly 
to implement and sustain.
Guided by previous research in the field, and in line 
with stage 1 of Medical Research Council (MRC) com -
plex intervention development and evaluation guidance 
[25], a novel-manualised web-based caregiver educa -
tional programme (called Better Living with Non-mem -
ory-led Dementia) was developed alongside people living 
with PCA, PPA and bvFTD and their family caregivers 
through an iterative and collaborative process (described 
in the methods section). This manuscript focusses on 
the study protocol for an RCT to test the feasibility of 
this programme as recommended in stage 2 of the MRC 
guidelines [25, 26].
Aims and objectives
The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of the Better 
Living with Non-memory-led Dementia programme. The 
objectives are as follows:
• Primary: To assess feasibility of recruitment, feasibil -
ity of measurement tools and acceptability (prospec -
tive, concurrent and retrospective).
Page 3 of 13
 Suárez‑González et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:172 
 
• Secondary: To assess the preliminary efficacy, under -
stood as directionality on the clinical measures (that 
can inform optimal outcomes measure in a full trial).
Methods
This protocol has been registered in ClinicalTrials.org 
(NCT05525377) and follows the SPIRIT reporting guide -
lines [27] (Chan et al., 2013) adapted with supplemented 
and replaced sections borrowed from the CONSORT 
extension for pilot trials, as recommended by Lancas -
ter and Thabane [28]. The patient and public involve -
ment (PPI) component of this study is reported following 
GRIPP2-SF [29].
Study design
This is the protocol for a pilot randomised wait-list con -
trolled feasibility trial followed by a qualitative evalu -
ation (mixed-method study). Participants randomly 
allocated to the intervention group will receive access to the educational programme for 8 weeks. Those in the 
wait-list control group will receive treatment as usual 
(i.e. pointed to Rare Dementia Support website (https:// 
www. rared ement iasup port. org/)) and access to the pro -
gramme at the end of data collection. The wait-list aimed 
to decrease attrition and also meet ethical demands 
(e.g. giving caregivers access to tailored educational 
resources that may potentially have a beneficial effect). 
Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, 8-week 
and 3-month post-randomisation. Semi-structured inter -
views will be conducted after completion of the 3-month 
follow-up baseline measures as part of a process evalua -
tion. The study participant flow chart is shown in Fig. 1.
Participants and research setting
People identifying themselves as caregivers of someone 
with PCA, PPA or bvFTD will be recruited from the Rare 
Dementia Support Impact project (RDS Impact) [30] and 
the wider Rare Dementia Support service (RDS) based 
Fig. 1 Participant flow chart of the Better Living with Non‑memory‑led Dementia feasibility trial
Page 4 of 13 Suárez‑González et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:172 
in the UK. See Brotherhood et al. [30] for details on the 
ethical procedures and consent.
Inclusion criteria are as follows:
a) Adults (18+) who self-identify as an unpaid caregiver 
(e.g. partners, children, friends) of someone with a 
diagnosis of PPA, PCA or bvFTD.
b) The person with dementia is not living in a full-time 
care facility.
c) The care recipient must have a confirmed diagnosis 
of one of these types of dementia through self-report 
of the caregiver (to reflect the ‘real-world’ application 
of the intervention).
Exclusion criteria are as follows:
a) Poor comprehension of written English.
b) No access to the Internet.
Power calculation
As this is a feasibility study, a formal power calculation 
is not required; however, the sample size does require 
justification. This study was initially intended to develop 
a tool for carers of people with bvFTD only. However, 
during the interviews with stakeholders, became appar -
ent the need and opportunity to develop two more tools, 
to cover PPA and PCA (details of sample calculation for 
bvFTD only can be found in Brotherhood  et al., [31]. 
Originally, we aimed to recruit 135 participants com -
prising 45 caregivers from each of the three diagnostic 
groups that the intervention is designed for (PCA, PPA, 
bvFTD) with a 30:15 intervention control split in a 2:1 
randomisation. This would have provided both a precise 
estimation of the overall retention rate but also within 
diagnostic group. Reviewing this target once recruit -
ment was underway, we acknowledged that this would 
be a large feasibility study, and with a rarer disease, it 
would require recruiting a large proportion of the avail -
able population. Therefore, we revised the target sample 
down to 30 participants (randomised 20:10 in favour of 
the intervention); this would allow an understanding of 
the trial processes, allow for adaptation and refinement 
of the intervention and understand acceptability and 
fidelity within the population. The confidence intervals 
on our estimates will be wider, but this is an acceptable 
concession given the sparsity of the potential population 
to recruit. We will achieve a 95% confidence interval of 
±18.7% around our expected value of 76% of those com -
pleting the intervention and pre-post measures whilst 
viewing 70+% sessions. In terms of retention to the study, 
we will achieve a 95% confidence interval of ±15.5% 
around our expected value of 75%.Progression criteria
Progression criteria for the trial will be considered in a 
holistic way with consideration given to possible refine -
ments and adaptations that can be made to the inter -
vention and the trial processes to mitigate any barriers 
encountered. Whilst we can set quantitative thresholds 
indicating success on elements of the feasibility trial, 
these will be taken into consideration with the context of 
the conditions under which these were obtained, in addi -
tion to qualitative information collected. Non-progres -
sion will only be considered on the basis as to whether 
any of the conditions are unlikely to be resolved. Quanti -
tative criteria will be fixed on recruitment and retention, 
whilst trial processes, suitability of proposed outcome 
measures, acceptability and fidelity will be assessed by 
a qualitative approach understanding the context of 
these. Successful recruitment will be denoted as achiev -
ing greater than 75% of proposed sample; less than 
25% recruited of the proposed sample will be defined 
as unsuccessful and unlikely to be remedied. Success -
ful retention will be denoted as greater than 70% of the 
recruited sample with unsuccessful retention denoted as 
less than 20% of the recruited sample.
Recruitment
Participants will be recruited from two sources:
1) Caregivers who have already consented to be 
involved in the wider RDS Impact study [30]
2) Caregivers who contact us following various com -
munications about the study (e.g. via the RDS service 
newsletter and social media, discussions between 
RDS members and RDS workers).
The consent procedure is as follows: (1) participants 
should first consent to participate in the wider RDS 
Impact study [30] of which this educational programme 
is a sub study, (2) participants will be sent a link to a 
Qualtrics  page (Qualtrics, Provo, UT),  at which point 
they will access screening questions as to their suitabil -
ity for inclusion, (3) if they are screened as eligible, they 
will be directed to an online opt-in consent form that 
they should complete before given access to the survey 
collecting demographics and baseline measures, and (4) 
if they are screened as ineligible, they will be directed to 
a page thanking them for their interest in the study and 
giving them email contacts for the Rare Dementia Sup -
port service in case they want to reach out for support. 
Both consent forms can be found in Appendix I. Using 
Qualtrics display logic, those who do not consent will 
automatically receive a message thanking them for con -
sidering involvement in the study and asking them why 
Page 5 of 13
 Suárez‑González et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:172 
 
they chose not to participate (being clear that they do not 
have to answer this if they do not want to).
We will recruit from each diagnostic group as screened. 
Up to fifteen semi-structured interviews will explore the 
experience during the study of a subgroup of partici -
pants. Individuals will be purposively sampled (by diag -
nostic subtype and allocation group) and approached via 
email asking if they want to participate. Interviews will be 
conducted post follow-up via Zoom.
Randomisation
Randomisation will be provided via secure online plat -
form hosted by NWORTH CTU, Bangor University. The 
randomisation procedure will be carried out by the pro -
ject manager of the study (E. B.). Once consent and base -
line measures have been completed, the participant can 
be entered into the randomisation system. Randomisa -
tion will be stratified by diagnosis (bvFTD, PPA, PCA). A 
dynamic adaptive randomisation algorithm will be used 
to maintain the allocation ratio of 2:1 in favour of the 
intervention and the balance within stratification varia -
bles. We intend to use an unequal allocation ratio during 
this feasibility study due to there being more uncertain -
ties about the interventional arm than the control arm. 
Development of the intervention and adjustment to the 
different diagnosis groups will benefit from providing 
more data from the feasibility study on the intervention 
arm specifically. The recruiting researcher will not be 
aware of allocations made; randomisation will be com -
pleted by a researcher independent of the other trial pro -
cesses. Given the nature of this trial, participants are not 
blinded to group allocation. Researchers are not blinded 
to group allocation either, but this does not bias measure 
collection since measures are self-reported online. Due to 
the use of unequal allocation in this stage of the evalua -
tion, it is not possible to keep analysts blind — however, 
given that no inferential statistics will be generated, the 
risk for introduction of bias at this level is minimal. The 
trial will be subject to internal audit and monitoring from 
within NWORTH CTU. Additional regular biweekly 
meetings of the researchers will be conducted to monitor 
progress and discuss any arising issues. The whole trial 
will be overseen by the wider research group.
Intervention
The intervention group will receive the Better Living 
with Non-memory-led Dementia programme, an 8-week 
duration 6-module educational programme covering the 
following topics: (1) welcome to the programme and what 
to expect from it, (2) understanding the disease, (3) how 
to provide better support for the person with dementia, 
(4) how to look after the caregiver’s own mental health, 
(5) where to find additional sources of support and (6) an introduction to the value of support groups. At the end 
of modules 2, 3 and 4, participants will be asked to com -
plete a real-life task to put in practice skills learned in the 
specific module (e.g. approaching a friend and explain -
ing the disease in lay terms). After that, every participant 
will be encouraged to reflect on that experience and share 
it with a programme facilitator via email. The facilitator 
will be a member of the team, with no clinical training, 
who will interact with the participant via email stick -
ing to principles of active engagement (a script has been 
developed on this purpose based on principles of active 
listening adapted to written communication (see Appen -
dix II). The facilitator will not act as an advisor as to the 
use of therapeutic techniques. All course modules will be 
printable using the PDF download button on the course’s 
page. An online version of the template for interventions

Intervention development
This educational programme was developed following 
the MRC guidance for development of complex interven -
tions [25, 26, 33] comprising the following stages:
Stage 1: Identifying existing evidence and interven -
tions The initial idea about the development of this 
educational programme was prompted by the experience 
of the research team (consisting of academics, clinicians 
and support workers specialised in non-memory led 
dementias) interacting with people with PCA, PPA and 
bvFTD and their families over the years. Rare Dementia 
Support, a specialised national support service for these 
types of dementia, is run by our group at UCL. In this 
first stage of the development, the authors conducted a 
revision of the most up-to-date literature on the broad 
topic of provision of online support for caregivers of peo -
ple with dementia, extracting information about relevant 
variables such as follows: intervention content, theories 
used for logic models, information about skills taught to 
caregivers in previous interventions, resources used to 
support learning, outcome measures, barriers and facili -
tators to caregiver engagement, details about how other 
blended interventions have been articulated, whether 
they work and if they are sustainable and have achieved 
successful implementation. A second step involved the 
revision of existing tools (both for online and face-to-
face delivery). Since most online interventions fail to 
reach the implementation phase [34], it is not surprising 
that we found far more papers describing the efficacy of 
the tools than tools themselves which were available for 
the research team to test. The quality of the studies con -
ducted also varied in quality. For the purpose to inform 
Page 6 of 13 Suárez‑González et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:172 
our intervention, we scrutinised a selection of stud -
ies that met the following criteria: (1) had a comparator 
group and (2) had a N above 20 in each arm (either RCT 
or pilot studies) [21, 35–49]. In a third step, we drew on 
the experience of colleagues leading the development 
of  or administering online interventions. We therefore 
held a series of meeting during the evidence gathering 
phase. We met with research colleagues involved in the 
development of Communication Bridge [50], Partners 
in Balance [22] and Rhapsody [24], three tools recently 
developed or adapted for people with young onset and 
non-memory led dementias. Meetings with NHS clini -
cians working in memory services and IAPT services and 
experience in the use of digital tools were also held. Mul -
tiple websites offering online information, training, ther -
apy and support were reviewed to inform web design, 
participant flow and user experience (e.g. https:// www. 
demen  tiaca recen  tral. com, https:// www. beati ngthe  blues. 
co. uk , https:// www. partn erinb  alans. nl/ stati cs/ de/).
Stage 2: Identifying theory This educational programme 
is informed by theories of self-efficacy [51], behaviour 
change [52], coping theory [53] and social learning the -
ory [51]. Self-efficacy is the person’s belief that one can 
perform competently and capably in given situation [51]. 
Caregivers with low self-efficacy beliefs tend to focus on 
their personal inefficiencies, the difficulty of the task and 
the negative consequences of failure. Self-efficacy is an 
important component of behaviour change. The COM-B 
model of behaviour change [52] argues that behaviour 
comes from an interaction of three factors: capability to 
perform the behaviour, opportunity and motivation to 
carry out the behaviour. Interventions for caregivers need 
to alter one or more of these three elements to achieve 
change. To select the most suitable behaviour change 
techniques (BCTs) for our intervention, we used the The -
ory and Techniques Tool [54] (https:// theor  yandt  echni 
queto  ol. human behav  iourc  hange. org/ tool). This tool also 
provides potential links between the BCTs and mecha -
nisms of action, which informed the format and content 
of the manuals of our programme. Coping refers to the 
strategies that individual use to manage stress [53], and 
these strategies may in turn affect the overall well-being 
of caregivers [55]. In the context of caregivers of people 
with dementia, coping strategies and social support can 
act as potential mediators between caregiver stressors 
and health outcomes [56]. Lastly, social learning the -
ory [51] posits that people learn from each other from 
observing, modelling and imitating their behaviour. This 
latter theoretical framework influenced the format of the 
resources used in this educational programme (e.g. abun -
dant vignettes and case studies, links to recordings of 
support group meetings and interviews with caregivers).Stage 3: Modelling process and outcomes Information 
from stages 1 and 2 was pulled together to develop a logic 
model (shown in Fig.  2). It was decided that the educa -
tional programme would consist of 6 modules or manu -
als following the structure of previous interventions for 
caregivers [22–24]. The broad content of the educational 
programme manuals was decided based on the interven -
tion targets and the co-production work with people with 
lived experience described in the section below. The spe -
cific way to bring that content to life was shaped by the 
behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action 
that were deemed to drive effective change and are listed 
in Fig.  2. According to our logic model, the outcomes 
of the educational programme are expected to include 
changes in caregiver self-efficacy, relationship with the 
care recipient, psychological status, quality of life and 
health and social health. The group of people with lived 
experience who co-produced the programme manuals 
also contributed to inform the clinical outcome measures 
used in the pilot feasibility trial.
Development of the manuals: coproduction with experts 
by experience The 6 modules/manuals of Better Living 
with Non-memory-led Dementia have been co-produced 
with a group of experts by experience (EbE) (people with 
dementia and/or their relatives) through an iterative 
process with investigator ASG. Members of the organi -
sation Rare Dementia Support were invited to join the 
co-production group. Distribution of a call for experts by 
experience flyers was used for this purpose (these flyers 
were co-produced with a couple of EbE and can be found 
in Supplementary material). Twenty-one EbE joined the 
co-production group between end of 2019 and 2021. Due 
to the Covid-19 pandemic, most meetings took place 
over videoconference and, exceptionally, phone or face 
to face (17 videoconferences, 1 phone call and 1 face-to-
face meeting). There was also extensive correspondence 
by email between the EbE group and ASG. The subgroup 
of EbE working on the manuals for bvFTD was entirely 
composed by relatives of people with bvFTD, and meet -
ings took place as a group. This was due to the difficulty 
to engage people with bvFTD in the process given the 
behavioural features and lack of insight characterising 
the condition. In the groups working on the PCA and 
PPA  manuals, there was representation of people living 
with the condition. To support the participation of the 
person with dementia, these meetings took place one to 
one between ASG and the person living with dementia 
and their relatives. Briefly, the procedure for the meet -
ings involved (1) sending supporting material before the 
meeting and information about how to prepare (cre -
ated following easy-to-read and inclusive guidelines); (2) 
Page 7 of 13
 Suárez‑González et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:172 
 
asking about preferred forms of communication prior 
to the meeting; (3) sending questions in advance to be 
asked during the meeting, so the person with dementia 
could have time to think and write down their responses 
if needed; and (4) sending minutes after the meetings in 
an accessible format for the person with dementia and 
their relatives to review together. This last step proved 
an important opportunity to correct inaccuracies and 
misunderstandings.
In the early stages of the development of the manuals, the 
work with the EbE group focused on the structure of the 
manuals and main messages to come across. For instance, 
one of our EbE with PPA wrote, ‘I would like people to 
understand that this is the way I speak, I have a condition, 
people need to be more patient’ . The husband of a person 
with PCA said about the manuals, ‘they should be written 
in a positive way and convey hope’ . The EbE group pro -
vided extensive advice about what symptoms to address 
in the programme and how, top priorities in manage -
ment of symptoms, what strategies were more important 
to consider, they shared real situations to be include as 
vignettes, made suggestions about options for respite and 
support, identified common barriers to implement symp -
tom management strategies and shared tips of how they 
had overcome them, how they managed difficult emo -
tions (e.g. shame, guilt), deal with legal issues, relation -
ships with others, and how they introduced companions 
and advice on what vocabulary to use in the manuals. The group preferred that all the material and resources from 
the course were also provided in a printable format (not 
only on the web) so people could share it with relatives 
and friends. The group also advised on the development 
of the website to host the education programme. Wire -
frames of the website were shared with the group either 
in videoconference meeting or by email, and their feed -
back was incorporated. In the late stages of the develop -
ment process, drafts of the manuals were circulated by 
email for EbE to review. It was predominantly EbE who 
were relatives, and not people with dementia, which con -
tributed to this last round. They sent feedback as notes 
in emails or direct corrections in the drafts of the manu -
als (either typed or handwritten). The group would also 
share personal resources they had found useful to under -
stand their relative’s condition, to manage symptoms and 
their own well-being. Some members of the EbE group 
also contributed to the final proofreading.
The work of co-production took place between October 
2019 and March 2022. The final draft of the manuals also 
received input from educational group facilitators and 
went through several rounds of proofreading with aca -
demic and clinical colleagues.
Content of the manuals Six learning modules per phe -
notype (PCA, PPA, bvFTD) resulted from the co-pro -
duction phase, making 18 in total. The first 3 modules Fig. 2 Logic model for the Better Living with Non‑memory‑led Dementia programme
Page 8 of 13 Suárez‑González et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:172 
are phenotype specific. The fourth one is common across 
phenotypes since it is focussed on caregiver wellbeing. 
The fifth module in each set contains a list of resources 
relevant across phenotypes (e.g. charities and organisa -
tions that can provide support), and the sixth one is an 
introduction to phenotype-specific support groups with 
links to three support group webinars each. Together, 
the 18 manuals contain 49 purpose-build illustrations, 
53 vignettes and 44 links to external resources (e.g. vide -
orecording of support meetings).
Accessibility In Brotherhood  et al., [31], we referred 
to enhancing the accessibility of the intervention for 
those with disability. However, during co-production, it 
became apparent that such measures were not necessary. 
The PPI group noted that there are already many freely 
available accessibility tools widely used by the commu -
nity of people with reading and visual disabilities.
Comparison
The control group (wait-list) will receive treatment as 
usual, consisting of explicit signposting to the publicly 
available Rare Dementia Support website and will con -
tinue with any kind of support the participants may 
already being receiving (e.g. psychological support, 
online information, support groups). They will be given 
access to the intervention at the end of the study.
Procedures
The flow of events for participants in this study is as 
follows:
1) Participants give online consent to take part in the 
study.
2) Once consent is given, they receive a link to a Qual -
trics survey to complete online demographic infor -
mation and baseline outcome measures.
3) After the surveys are filled out, participants are ran -
domised and notified of whether they will be given 
access to the intervention or to treatment as usual.
4) Participants in the intervention group receive an 
email with a link (unique for each participant) to 
access the online intervention. Clicking on this link 
will give them access to a bespoken online plat -
form purposely built for this study. Participants are 
encouraged to go through the 6 modules comprising 
the programme (the 6 modules are available at the 
same time). They are also encouraged to engage with 
the programme facilitator via email, to reflect on 
their experience putting in practice the skills learnt 
in modules 2, 3 and 4. The intervention is tailored to 
each phenotype: participants caring for a person with 
PCA only access the PCA modules, etc.5) Participants in the control group are redirected to an 
existing website about rare dementia. They do not 
receive additional support.
6) Eight weeks after randomisation and access to the 
programme (or redirection to the website) has been 
granted, participants receive a new link to Qualtrics 
to complete follow-up outcome measures. This is 
repeated 3 months after randomisation.
Data collection, management and analysis
Demographics
After giving consent, participants will fill in an online 
survey with demographic information before start com -
pleting the baseline measures.
Feasibility measures
The following feasibility measures will be collected:
a) Recruitment process
• Number of people agreeing to be sent information 
about the study.
• Proportion of participants who agree to partici -
pate.
• Proportion of eligible participants who agree to 
participate.
• Potential inequalities in recruitment feasibility 
will be assessed by comparing basic data on eth -
nicity age, gender and diagnosis of care recipient 
between Rare Dementia Support members, those 
who are screened as eligible for and those who 
consent to the study.
b) Retention
• The analysis will consider the points from the 
CONSORT checklist for randomised pilot and 
feasibility trials [57] to ensure that all topics are 
being covered. Values for eligibility rates, recruit -
ment rates, attrition rates and withdrawal rates 
will be reported using the participant flow data 
collected within the study. This will be evaluated 
overall and per group.
• Furthermore, details on reasons for ineligibility 
and non-recruitment will be reported within a 
table along with their related patient frequencies 
and percentages. Information on withdrawals and 
nonrespondents will be presented including rea -
sons where applicable and time points during the 
trial.
c) Feasibility of measurement tools

 Suárez‑González et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:172 
 
• Time taken to fill in questionnaires (with consid -
eration for outlier times to be those where par -
ticipants have left the questionnaire to complete at 
another time).
• Missing data from questionnaires (questionnaires 
will be implemented using the Qualtrics func -
tion that reminds participants when they have not 
filled in an item, but will not force a choice).
• Follow-up response rates (8-week and 3-month 
post-randomisation).
Acceptability measures
We used the definition of acceptability recently proposed 
by [58] to decide on the following acceptability measures:
a) Prospective acceptability  
• Burden (reasons for not taking part or discontinua -
tion).
• Percentage who completed baseline measures agree -
ing to be randomised and reasons for not taking part 
in randomisation.
• Answers to qualitative questions in baseline ques -
tionnaire about how they feel about the interven -
tion (e.g. how do you feel about taking part in this 
course?), burden (e.g. how much effort do you think 
will be involved in taking part in this study?) and eth -
icality (e.g. do you have any ethical concerns about 
taking part in the course? If yes, what would these 
be? (See Appendix  III ).
b) Concurrent acceptability 
• Intervention coherence and adherence
o Task completion rate after every module.
o Number of interactions with facilitator.
c) Retrospective acceptability   It will be measured in two 
ways:
1. To capture views of everyone participating in the 
study, follow-up measures will include a brief accept -
ability questionnaire designed to assess opportunity 
costs and perceived effectiveness. The health eco -
nomic questions used for the control and interven -
tion group will differ: participants in the interven -
tion arm will be asked questions on resource use and 
questions on willingness to pay, whilst those in the wait-list control arm will be asked about resource-
use only. Participants in the wait-list control arm will 
be asked about acceptability of filling in the measures 
at each time point. Participants in the intervention 
group will be asked about acceptability of the inter -
vention (see Appendix III ).
2. A more in-depth qualitative interview focussed on 
the above headers (as well as mechanisms of change) 
will be given to a smaller number (n~15) of purpo -
sively sampled individuals.
Proposed clinical measures
The range of clinical outcomes encompassing self-effi -
cacy, relationship with care recipient, psychological sta -
tus, quality of life and health and social health will be 
assessed at baseline line, 8-week and 3-month post-ran -
domisation. An additional section about health econom -
ics will be added to explore the feasibility of evaluating 
the costs of the educational programme in a larger trial. 
We will be using the following measures:
 1. WHO 5 Well-being Index [59]
 2. GAD-7 [60]
 3. PHQ-9 [61]
 4. De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale [62]
 5. Lubben Social Network Scale [63]
 6. Pearlin Mastery Scale [64]
 7. Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale [65]
 8. Dementia Management Strategies Scale [66]
 9. The quality of carer-partner relationship scale [67]
 10. Health economics questions (developed by the 
health economic collaborators, RTE and BA) (see 
Appendix  III ).
The recommended SPIRIT schedule for the enrolment 
or participants, administration of the intervention and 
assessment time points is shown in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data
All analysis will be guided by the principle of intention to 
treat. There will be a preliminary analysis of intervention 
outcomes. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated using adjusted means from the analy -
sis and used to estimate standard deviations and effect 
sizes for continuous data. Means and standard deviations 
of response rates for count data and proportions in each 
category will be provided. These will be used to confirm 
the sample size calculation for a definitive study. Depend -
ent on the recruitment within each diagnosis group, we 
may consider presenting preliminary results within diag -
nosis groups. Exploratory analysis will be performed to

determine the most appropriate model of analysis for a 
definitive RCT, including consideration of the further 
possible covariates and factors to be included in an anal -
ysis model. All quantitative analysis will be completed 
using Stata 17, SPSS v25 and R version 3.
Qualitative data
Semi-structured online interviews for collecting data on 
participant experience and programme usability will be 
recorded via Zoom and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts 
will be analysed using thematic analysis [68]. Members of 
the research team with experience in thematic analysis 
will be involved in the qualitative analysis of data and will 
assess data saturation throughout the Zoom interview 
process.
Discussion
This is a protocol paper for a feasibility study that will 
serve to inform the first large-scale RCT of an educa -
tional intervention for caregivers of people living with 
PCA, PPA and bvFTD. Whilst emerging evidence sug -
gests that caregivers of people with young onset demen -
tia and FTD can benefit from web-based psychosocial 
programmes, there is a dearth of digital tailored interven -
tions for PCA, PPA and bvFTD specifically. Online provi -
sion of support in the form of educational programmes 
might be beneficial for improving caregiver self-efficacy 
and psychological and health-related clinical outcomes. 
However, the scarcity of RCTs yields uncertainty about 
whether the delivery of such programmes is effective 
and suitable to be rolled out at large scale. Our study will 
contribute to respond to these questions and to advance 
our understanding of digitally delivered and self-adminis -
tered training programmes for carers of people with non-
memory-led dementias.
