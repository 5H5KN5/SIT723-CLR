Reducing Inner-City Women's AIDS Risk Activities:
A Study of Single, Pregnant Women

Behavioral change reduces risk of HIV infection and development of AIDS. We compared 206
inner-city women who were randomly assigned to a 4-session AIDS-prevention group or to one of
two controls, a health-promotion group or a no-intervention group. AIDS-prevention and
health-promotion groups provided information, behavioral competency training, and social
support. Only the AIDS-prevention group focused on AIDS-specific knowledge and skills. The
AIDS-prevention group produced moderate, consistent increases in knowledge and safer sex
behaviors hi comparison with either the health-promotion or no-intervention group. Self-report
and objective changes were sustained 6 months after intervention for both African-American and
European-American women.
Key words: AIDS, HIV, inner-city women, women, African American
Development of effective behavioral intervention to reduce
women's risk for exposure to HIV infection is critical (Ickovics
& Rodin, 1992; Mays & Cochran, 1988). It is estimated that
about 37,000 women have been diagnosed with AIDS (Centers
for Disease Control, 1993), and the number of women affected
is doubling every 1-2 years. Early research attention in the
United States focused on gay men and injection drug users
(Mays, Albee, & Schneider, 1989), but the greater number of
heterosexuals in the population translates to greater ultimate
risk for the general population as the epidemic widens. Given
that male-to-female transmission of HIV is as much as 12 times
more likely as female-to-male transmission (Padian, Shiboski,
& Jewell, 1990), women are at appreciable risk in heterosexual
relationships.
Women of color and inner-city women in general are at
particular risk for HIV exposure because of the rate of
infection among others with whom they are likely to be in
sexual contact and because of the higher than average preva-
lence of injection drug users in the inner city (Centers for
Disease Control, 1991). Their risk is further increased to the
extent that safer sex behaviors are inconsistent with cultural
imperatives (Mays & Cochran, 1988). Women of color may not

confrontational on sexual matters, to demand monogamy, to
use condoms, or to discuss their partners' sexual history
(Ickovics & Rodin, 1992; Mays & Cochran, 1988). Further-
more, condom use impedes reproduction, which is a desired
goal in many cases. Women may also erroneously still believe
that they are not at risk (Kalichman, Hunter, & Kelly, 1992).
Kelly and Murphy (1992) wrote, "it is discouraging that,
even more than 10 years into the AIDS epidemic, there have
still been only a handful of controlled studies evaluating the
behavioral change impact of HIV prevention interventions"
(p. 578). Cognitive-behavioral risk reduction efforts have,
however, proven successful in those few reported controlled
studies (Jemmott, Jemmott, & Fong, 1992; Kelly, St. Lawrence,
Hood, & Brashfield, 1989; Rotheram-Borus, Koopman, &
Haignere, 1991). To our knowledge, only one North American
study has found appreciable change among women after
intervention (Rotheram-Borus et al., 1991), and no study has
shown such change for women in a randomized control design
or among inner-city women or women of color.
Prevention of HIV infection depends on behavioral change,
but few prevention studies have been conducted that address
behavioral impact (Kelly & Murphy, 1992). Furthermore, any
objective information that buttresses trends found in self-
report would be enormously helpful in drawing conclusions
about program effectiveness.
Previous research suggests that the components of a success-
ful prevention program include: (a) providing accurate informa-
tion on transmission and safer sex options, (b) raising women's
personal sense of risk, (c) increasing their competence to
perform safer sex behaviors, (d) increasing their beliefs that
they can successfully perform safer sex behaviors, (e) increas-
ing social support for such behavior, and (f) placing the
behavior within an acceptable cultural context for the target
group (Ickovics & Rodin, 1992; Kelly & Murphy, 1992; Mays &
Cochran, 1988). There is also growing agreement that condom
use is a key goal because, first, people are not necessarily privy
to knowledge about their partners' sexual behavior and,

second, as HIV infection increases, there is decreasing merit in
the strategy of reducing the number of partners. We incorpo-
rated these components in a multiple-session intervention
program for single, pregnant, inner-city women.
Theoretically, our intervention was based on Bandura's
(1977) social learning theory and Hobfoll's (1988, 1989)
conservation of resources (COR) theory. Social learning theory
emphasizes the use of modeling to increase specific feelings of
efficacy around targeted behaviors. COR theory suggests that
the threat of AIDS is an additional stressor facing women who
are already overtaxed in their coping efforts. In such situations
COR theory posits that an intervention must increase both
women's personal and social resources in order to combat
increased threat. COR theory further suggests that target
groups must see the intervention as both adding new resources
and building on their current resource strengths.
We also felt that an emphasis on communal mindedness was
relevant to women in general (Jackson & Meadows, 1991;
Myers, 1988), as women tend to make better use of social
support than do men (Hobfoll & Stokes, 1988). Studies of the
psychology of women assert a similar emphasis (Winstead &
Derlega, 1993), and we felt that a communal orientation would
be palatable to our participants. Hence, we adopted a commu-
nal emphasis to our intervention, underscoring the need for
women to support each other, their families, and the health of
their community.
We chose single, pregnant women as the target group for
our study because they come for care and become accessible to
prevention effprts, they risk infecting themselves and their
fetus or infant, and they may be particularly motivated to
improve their health because of their maternal feelings. Also,
because being single and pregnant in the inner-city is norma-
tive (Lancaster & Hamburg, 1986), this strategy may poten-
tially be applied to millions of women. Previous work also
indicated that women from this particular sample base had
poor AIDS knowledge and did not consider themselves at risk
for HIV infection (Hobfoll, Jackson, Lavin, Britton, & Shep-
herd, 1993).
We predicted that the AIDS-prevention intervention would
be most effective in producing increases in knowledge about
AIDS and both the intent to adopt and actual adoption of safer
sex behaviors because it concentrated on AIDS-related knowl-
edge, attitudes, and skills. We further predicted that the
health-promotion intervention would be more successful than
the no-intervention control, because many of the same behav-
iors and attitudes that relate to being healthy generalize to
adoption of safer sex behavior.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited between August 1990 and March 1992
from among single, inner-city women who sought obstetrical care at
three inner-city clinics for low-income women in a middle-sized,
Midwestern city. We restricted analyses to women who completed at
least 3 of 4 intervention sessions. The final sample included 206
women.
One hundred eighteen (57%) of the women were African Ameri-
cans, and 82 (40%) were non-Hispanic European Americans. There
were 6 women (3%) of other ethnic origins. The women's average agewas 21.0 years (range, 16-29). Thirty-three percent did not complete
high school, 36% completed high school, and 30% had some post-high
school education or training. Most (75%) had incomes under $10,000
per year. Forty-five percent of the women had already had at least one
child.
Few demographic differences were found between African- and
European-American participants. When these differences were signifi-
cant, they were not appreciably related to the outcome variables and
hence did not affect the hypotheses. We also conducted analyses of 37
women who began but did not complete the study. Only one significant
difference was found for 18 tests between dropouts and retainees on
any of the demographic and outcome variables, namely, dropouts were
slightly more educated. One significant finding in 18 is likely to be
attributable to chance. There was no differential drop-out rate for
ethnic group.
Measures
We assessed a variety of variables, including measures of AIDS-
related knowledge, safer sex practices, self-report of intention to
purchase and reported purchase of condoms and spermicide, and
pharmacy reports of condom and spermicide acquisition. Women also
responded to questions about the number of their partners. Measures
were carefully pilot tested so that virtually all women could complete
them with no more than minor assistance. Assistance was, however,
always available.
Safer sex knowledge. A safer sex knowledge questionnaire mea-
sured the accuracy of subjects' knowledge of HIV transmission and
prevention. Items were scored as either incorrect or correct, and
scores are the percentage of items correctly answered. The 8 questions
used to assess knowledge of HIV transmission were adopted from the
National Public Health Service AIDS Information Survey (U.S. Public
Health Service, 1988). The items assessed the degree to which
participants understood that the HIV virus is transferred by the
exchange of body fluids and not by casual contact. Participants rated
from 1 to 4 the likelihood of being infected through different types of
exposure. The 6 items on prevention assessed knowledge of ways to
prevent HIV infection during sexual contact. The two parts were
designed separately, but the strong relation between the two subscales
and other similar findings for them led to our combining them into a
single scale. One item was deleted because of its poor item-total
correlation, which resulted in a 13-item scale with an internal
consistency of .74.
Current condom and spermicide usage. The women were asked
about their use of condoms and spermicide over the preceding few
weeks. The two items focused on use of condoms and spermicide
during vaginal sex. Ratings were made on a 4-point scale, no,
sometimes, almost always, or always, whenever I have sex. Cronbach's
alpha for this sample was .84.
Anal-sex practices. Anal sex was practiced at any time during the
periods assessed in the study by about 25% of the participants. For
these 47 women only, condom and spermicide usage during anal sex
was assessed; the other women responded that they had not engaged in
this behavior. The women were asked to rate their behavior (on the
same scale given for current condom and spermicide usage) during
anal sex. Two items were used, "I use condoms" and "I use condoms
and spermicide" (past few weeks). They were answered on a +-pqint
scale: no, • sometimes, almost always or always, whenever I have sex.
Internal consistency for these two items was .88.
Abstinence and number of partners. Women reported whether or
not they had been refraining from sexual contact (i.e., abstinence),
whether they had chosen monogamy, and the number of recent sexual
partners. Women were also questioned about the number of their
partners during the preceding year (no partners, 1 partner, 2-4partners,
or 5 or more).

REDUCING WOMEN'S AIDS RISK 399
Discussion with partners. A single item was used to assess whether
women discussed AIDS-related behavior with their partners. The item
was phrased as follows: "I discuss AIDS and AIDS prevention with my
partner(s)." It was answered on a 4-point scale: 1 = no, 2 = I discuss it
[only] when mypartner(s) initiates discussion, 3 = / initiate discussion if I
believe partner(s) may be infected or at risk, and 4 = 7 always initiate
discussion.
Intention and purchase of condoms and spermicide. Women re-
ported whether they intended to purchase condoms and spermicide in
the future and whether or not they had recently been obtaining
condoms and spermicide. The four items were: "I intend to buy or
obtain condoms," "I intend to buy or obtain spermicide," "I have
bought or obtained condoms," and "I have bought or obtained
spermicide." These statements were rated on a 4-point scale: 1 = no, 2
= occasionally, 3 = frequently, and 4 = all the time (i.e., when I need
them). We combined their intentions and reports of obtaining con-
doms and spermicide, because we were interested in current and
future behavior and because the items were moderately correlated,
which suggested a single underlying construct. Cronbach's alpha for
this scale was .72.
Pharmacy report of obtaining condoms and spermicide. Women
were issued condom credit cards that contained their photo and
identification number (but not their name). They were allowed to use
these cards at three pharmacies that were convenient to the clinic sites.
They could choose any brand of latex condom. These cards were valid
from the time they began their study participation until 12 months
after the intervention (yoked to time for the no-intervention control
group participants). We received reports of the number of condoms
and spermicide tubes obtained and the identification numbers of those
who obtained them.
Procedure
Participant selection and questionnaire scheduling. Single, pregnant
women were randomly assigned to this study and invited to participate.
The women were approached if they were single (i.e., not living with a
partner steadily for 6 months or longer and not married), under 6
months pregnant, and between 16 and 29 years of age. Women who
were under treatment for a chronic illness (e.g., diabetes or kidney
disorders) were excluded. As an incentive, women were paid $10, $15,
and $20 for their pretest, posttest, and follow-up participation,
respectively. Women were given $5 for car fare and to offset child-care
costs for each group attended. Women who completed all question-
naires had their names placed in a lottery for a color television (one
was awarded yearly over three years). Parental permission was
required for minors, in addition to the minor's assent; otherwise
women gave their own informed consent.
At initial contact, women completed the instruments and items.
Approximately 80% of women who were approached agreed to
participate. The participants were randomly assigned to either an
AIDS-prevention group (Group 1) or one of two control groups, a
health-promotion group (Group 2) or a no-intervention group (Group
3). Fifty percent more women were assigned to Group 1 or Group 2
than to Group 3 (for every 3 women assigned to each of the first
groups, 2 were assigned to the last) in order to ensure enough
participants for intervention sessions. Questionnaires were adminis-
tered again at the end of the women's group participation and 6
months later. Group 3 responded to questionnaires on a schedule that
paralleled the intervention groups.
Selection and training of group leaders. Female group leaders were
selected from among master's-level psychologists and health educa-
tors. They were selected for empathy with target women, AIDS and
health knowledge, and their ability to communicate a positive health
message. Training consisted of role playing, videotape feedback, and
discussion with two experienced professionals with backgrounds inmulticultural psychology. Representatives of different ethnic groups
were selected to maximize representative discussion when ideas and
problems were considered in the ongoing research and intervention.
Intervention. Women in the two intervention groups participated in
four curriculum-based sessions (for groups of 2-8 women) that began
during their second trimester of pregnancy. Groups lasted 1V4-2 hr for
each session, and women typically came to group every 2nd or 3rd
week. Women did not necessarily attend with the same group of
women, as their lives were simply not organized in a fashion that
allowed this. However, scheduling was conducted to ensure that
women visited the appropriate group (i.e., session number and type).
A detailed qualitative account of the intervention may be found in
Levine et al. (1993).
Group leaders operated interactively with four studio-quality video-
tapes. Following the videotapes and the planned curriculum increased
uniformity across groups. The group leader showed a taped segment,
for example, and then asked women to discuss it or to role play. Taped
segments illustrated assertiveness, negotiation skills, planning skills,
and specialized skills (e.g., cleaning drug works). Tapes also had
general interest segments, such as live-action illustrations of comfort-
able, healthy sexual positions during later pregnancy. The videotapes
featured a group of actors from a similar population as the target
group. The group leader on the videotape was an experienced, female,
African-American health educator who portrayed warmth, understand-
ing, and openness. For example, one taped segment portrayed women
who hesitated to role play and then conducted the role playing after
the warm encouragement and praise of the group leader. Tapes served
as both stimulus material and models for the live group leaders and
targeted group participants.
Each session had a specific focus but addressed the same set of
competencies already described (i.e., assertiveness, etc.). The AIDS-
prevention and health-promotion groups were yoked. They focused on
identical general competencies for matched portions of time but
differed in terms of content. For example, when assertiveness for
refusing sex without a condom was the Group 1 theme, Group 2
worked on assertively turning down alcohol. When Group 1 practiced
aversive conditioning toward unsafe sex, Group 2 was exposed to
aversive conditioning for smoking while pregnant. In this way, Group
2's program design controlled not only for use of time but for general
skills as well. Differences between Groups 1 and 2 ought to be
attributable to the specific AIDS content. Differences between Groups
2 and 3 ought to be attributable to differences in skill acquisition not
specific to AIDS prevention.
The central theme of the sessions for both the AIDS-prevention and
health-promotion groups was to formulate and apply a sound health
action plan. To enhance practice of action plans, sessions encouraged
a sense of mastery, positive expectation of success, negotiation skills,
assertiveness skills, and fear of negative health consequences for not
acting in an healthy manner. Mastery was addressed by reinforcing
positive actions and prior successes and by projecting positive expect-
ancies of women's success. Role playing was used to illustrate how
behaviors could be enacted, to provide feedback, and to share ideas.
For more private behaviors (e.g., using a condom during loving sexual
play), women learned cognitive rehearsal (Meichenbaum, 1977). In
cognitive rehearsal the participants described a situation or one was
described to them, and then they imagined themselves problem
solving. The groups reviewed scenarios and made suggestions and
offered support.
Sessions also included aversive-conditioning (Wolpe, 1958) seg-
ments to increase both a sense of vulnerability and mastery. Women
imagined a scene in which they practiced an unhealthy behavior and
had an aversive outcome (e.g., became infected). The technique, if
done correctly (see Wolpe, 1958), produces a deeply felt emotional
and visceral reaction. We added a secondary component consistent
with this type of classical conditioning. Specifically, after the negative

health scenario, we paired a healthy behavior with a positive outcome
(e.g., having a healthy baby) and the attending joyful emotions. This
addition was designed to increase a sense of mastery.
The final session specifically addressed relapse prevention. Discus-
sion, role playing, and cognitive rehearsal focused on possible ob-
stacles to women's continued and increased adoption of healthy
behaviors.
Finally, the social support that was engendered in these groups must
not be underestimated. We encouraged and built on women's commu-
nal mindedness. This entailed emphasizing the importance of behavior
change in the context of its relevance to the self, unborn child, family,
and ethnic group.
Results
Preliminary Analyses
Means and standard deviations for study variables are found
in Table 1. The AIDS-prevention group contained 68 women,
the health-promotion group contained 77 women, and the
no-intervention group contained 61 women. No preinterven-tion differences between the groups were found on outcome
variables.
Treatment Effects
Women were first compared on the continuous outcome
variables (i.e., safer sex knowledge, condom and spermicide
use, intentions and purchase of condoms and spermicide, and
discussion of safer sex with their partners) in a 3 x 2
multivariate analysis of covariance. Although the properties of
these scales are not strictly interval, this type of statistic is
generally accepted as appropriate for this kind of data (Cliff,
1993). Outcomes that had significant univariate F ratios were
further analyzed in 3 x 2 analyses of covariance. For each of
these analyses, pretest scores were used as the covariate, the
first factor was group membership, and the second factor was a
repeated measure (i.e., posttest and follow-up). When the
univariate F ratio was significant, posttest means, adjusted for
pretest scores, were compared in the Dunn-Sidak multiple

comparison procedure (Kirk, 1982). These comparisons were
designed to reveal significant group differences attributable to
the intervention, because the covariate (i.e., pretest scores)
statistically controlled for any initial differences. Group changes
that occurred after intervention (i.e., the presence of group
differences at follow-up that were not evident at posttest or
differences at posttest that were no longer present at follow-
up) are noted by significant Group x Time interactions.
The results of the multivariate analysis of covariance showed
overall significant effects for group, F(8,368) = 4.14,p < .001,
time, F(4, 188) = 3.52, p < .008, and the covariate (initial
scores), F(4, 184) = 21.98, p < .001. The group main effect
indicates that there were significant differences between the
different intervention modes. The time effect indicates that
there was some significant change between posttest and
follow-up, but the absence of a Time x Group interaction
indicates that group differences were sustained from posttest
to follow-up. The significant effect of the covariate simply
means that initial scores were related to later scores.
Secondary analyses of covariance gave significant effects for
group for the four outcome variables tested, knowledge, safer
sex intentions and behaviors, discussion of AIDS and AIDS
prevention with partners, and condom and spermicide usage
(see Table 2). How the groups actually differed was further
examined in Dunn-Sidak multiple comparisons (see Table 3).
Group 1 made significantly greater gains than either Group 2
or Group 3 in almost every case. Group 2 tended not to change
significantly, in comparison with Group 3. Again, the lack of
Group x Time effects indicated that these changes were
sustained at follow-up.1
Pharmacy reports. Reports of the numbers of condom and
spermicide acquisitions (each credit card use equaled a box of
12 condoms or 1 tube of spermicide) were compared in a
one-way multivariate analysis of variance with group member-
ship as the between-subjects variable and the numbers of boxes
of condoms and tubes of spermicide as the dependent mea-
sures. If the univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were
significant, comparisons among the means were conducted
with the Dunn-Sidak procedure. Because so many of the
women did not use the condom credit card to obtain safer sex
supplies from the pharmacies, these data were also trans-
formed and reanalyzed. By comparing the ratio of the largest
and smallest range of the smallest and largest transformed
score of each group for different transformations (Kirk, 1982),
it was determined that a reciprocal transformation best suited
the data.
The overall group effect was significant, F(4, 404) = 4.98,
p < .001. Secondary ANOVAs indicated significant group
effects for both condom acquisition, F(2,180) = 9.37,p < .001,
and spermicide acquisition, F(l, 180) = 3.57, p < .03. The
Dunn-Sidak test indicated significantly greater condom and
spermicide acquisition for the AIDS-prevention group than
for the no-intervention group. The health-promotion group
also obtained more condoms than the no-intervention group
but did not obtain more spermicide.
We also conducted chi-square analyses to determine whether
more women in the AIDS-prevention group used the credit
cards. More women in Group 1 (55.9%) and Group 2 (46.4%)
used the credit cards to obtain condoms than did women inTable 2

Group 3 (18.2%). The overall chi-square for groups was
significant, x2(2, AT = 183) = 18.10, p < .001. However, no
significant overall differences were found for the numbers of
women who obtained spermicide, x2(2, N = 183) = 5.58, p <
.06.
Follow-up chi-square analyses on pairs of groups were
conducted to determine which groups actually differed on
condom acquisition by partitioning the chi-squares with two
orthogonal partitions, Group 1 versus Group 2 and Groups 1
and 2 versus Group 3. The AIDS-prevention and health-

analysis suggested that frequency was not related to risk. Indeed,
women jn more stable relationships had intercourse most frequently.
We did, however, look at group differences in frequency of inter-
course, as this might affect the meaning of condom use. There were no
group differences found.

Note. Group 1 = AIDS-prevention group; Group 2 = health-
prevention group; Group 3 = no-intervention group. For self-report
data, comparisons were conducted on postintervention scores. For
pharmacy data, comparisons were on the total number of boxes of
condoms and tubes of spermicide.
'Critical difference for three comparisons at alpha of .05 and with 120
degrees of freedom is 2.442. "Significant difference between groups:

transformed by an inverse function. In the transformed case, higher
means are associated with smaller transformed scores.
promotion groups did not significantly differ from each other,
X2(l, N = 128) = 1.20, p > .20, but they did significantly differ
from the no-intervention group, x2(l> N = 183) = 16.90, p <
.001.
Abstinence. A chi-square analysis was conducted to analyze
for change in abstinence status in a Group x Time design,
which looked for change in frequency of abstinent cases.
Change was measured only between initial and follow-up
reporting, because posttest reporting just preceded delivery,
and this alone may have affected abstinence temporarily. The
result was not significant, x*(6, N = 206) = 2.45,p = .87.
Anal sex. A separate analysis was conducted for those
women who reported participating in anal sex at any time in
the study period. An analyis of covariance was conducted, with
control for the initial levels of use of condoms and spermicide
during anal sex. There was a significant effect for time,
/•(I, 44) = 5.09, p < .03, and the Group x Time interaction,
F(2, 44) = 4.64, p < .02, was also significant. Group 2 made
initial gains in condom and spermicide usage, but these were
lost at follow-up.
Number of partners. A chi-square analysis was conducted to
analyze for change in number of partners in a Group x
Change design. Because the period was the preceding year,
there was no overlap between pretest and follow-up. Threelevels of change were considered (more, fewer, or the same
number of partners at follow-up than at pretest). The test was
not significant, x2(4, N = 204) = 2.26, p = .69.
Interactions with ethnicity. We reran the multivariate and
univariate analyses of covariance and the multivariate analyses
of variance and the ANOVAs. For these analyses we added
ethnicity (African American vs. European American) as a
dummy coded variable. None of the interactions of ethnicity
with group were significant (p > .25). This indicates that the
effects were independent of ethnic minority status.
Discussion
The AIDS-prevention group outperformed the health-
promotion and no-treatment control groups on most outcome
variables. Most of the changes made at the end of the
intervention were sustained at the 6-month follow-up. This
suggests at least a moderate effect of our treatment program.
Furthermore, the intervention was effective for both African
Americans and European Americans. The health-promotion
group participants also obtained more condoms than the
no-intervention group subjects.
The positive findings for knowledge, self-reported behavior,
and objectively reported behavior suggest that important
changes occurred. The magnitude of these changes varied, and
most were moderate, which reflects the spectrum of change
from none at all to major changes among individual women.
This also reflects women's individual needs and perceptions.
For example, for some women, condom use did not need to
occur because they actually had a mutually monogamous
relationship, whereas others incorrectly perceived their rela-
tionship to be mutually monogamous (Hobfoll et al., 1993).
Unless an intervention focuses on a sample homogeneous as to
high risk, one must not expect that more than moderate
average change on any give outcome will occur in the most
successful program.
The intervention did not produce predicted changes in
abstinence or number of partners. These predictions may be
particularly incongruent with our study population's goals.
Change in number of partners may not have occurred because
few women in our sample had a high number of partners (as in
the case in the general population) and our participants were
at a time of life that a few sexual partners a year is normative
and developmentally consistent (Tanfer & School, 1992).
Hence, most women already had only a few partners, and
turning to abstinence may not fit their romantic desires or
needs. Also, as the women did not necessarily know if their
partners were practicing risky behaviors, decreasing number of
partners was less important than condom use (Boyer &
Kegeles, 1991).
Our multiple control groups design allowed us to narrow
down the important intervention ingredients somewhat (Cook
& Campbell, 1979). It appears that the general competencies
of assertiveness, negotiation skills, and planning ability were
not in themselves adequate for meaningful behavioral change.
If they had been, the health-promotion group would have been
as successful as the AIDS-prevention group. Rather, it seems
women also needed to have the competencies, and perhaps

expectancies, specifically tied to AIDS information and AIDS-
specific risk reduction.
Compensation for participating in our study may also have
affected the outcome. There is reason to believe that it may
have increased participation, but at the same time decreased
effort, as women could attribute their participation to external
sources rather than internal motivations (Lepper & Green,
1978). Care must also be taken in generalizing our study's
findings. First, although pregnancy is normative, and we
followed women well after delivery, this nevertheless is a
special time of life. Women may be motivated to behave in a
healthy manner at this time, and indeed this was a primary
reason for our choice of this target group. By 6 months
postpartum women had returned to levels of sexual activity
similar to what they reported in the year before the beginning
of intervention, which suggests that the follow-up period did
allow us some insight into the women's general behavior when
not pregnant.
Furthermore, few of our participants reported greater than
5 partners during the preceding year. Rotheram-Borus et al.
(1991) also found that rather few women (even among those
thought to be sexually active) have more than a handful of
partners during a year. Nevertheless, this means that we
cannot generalize to those few women who have many part-
ners. We also had wanted women to meet with the same group
of women at each intervention session, but this did not prove
feasible in pilot testing. However, we were surprised at the
amount of support women felt they received in the groups.
Future research can examine this issue directly, as we only
have spontaneous reports of social support generated by the
groups.
In this investigation we demonstrated the potential benefit
of psychosocial efforts to prevent HIV infection. Even though
average change was only moderate, this may translate to
potentially major impact on a public health scale. The fact that
change was sustained 6 months after intervention and the use
of pharmacy reports of condom and spermicide purchases
serve to buttress the reliability of the findings and increase our
confidence that intervention produces meaningful behavioral
change.
