Abstract
Background: Despite substantial evidence for physical activity (PA) as a management option for type 2 diabetes, there
remains a lack of PA behavioural interventions suitable for delivery in primary care. This paper describes the systematic
development of an evidence-informed PA behavioural intervention for use during routine primary care consultations.
Methods: In accordance with the Medical Re search Council Framework for t he Development and Evaluation
of Complex Interventions, a four-stage systematic deve lopment process was undertaken: (1) exploratory work
involving interviews and workshop discussions identified training needs of healthcare professionals and support
needs of adults with type 2 diabetes; (2) a systematic re view with meta- and moderator analyses identified
behaviour change techniques and optimal intervention intensity and duration; (3) usability testing identified
strategies to increase implementation of the intervention in primary care and (4) an open pilot study in two
primary care practices facilitated intervention optimisation.
Results: Healthcare professional training needs included knowledge about type, intensity and duration of PA sufficient
to improve glycaemic control and acquisition of skills to promote PA behaviour change. Patients lacked knowledge
about type 2 diabetes and skills to enable them to make sustainable changes to their level of PA. An accredited online
training programme for healthcare professionals and a professional-delivered behavioural intervention for adults with
type 2 diabetes were subsequently developed. This multifaceted intervention was informed by the theory of planned
behaviour and social cognitive theory and consisted of 15 behaviour change techniques. Intervention intensity and
duration were informed by a systematic review. Usability testing resolved technical problems with the online training
intervention that facilitated use on practice IT systems. An open pilot study of the intervention with fidelity of delivery
assessment informed optimisation and identified mechanisms to enhance implementation of the intervention during
routine diabetes consultations.

Conclusions: Movement as Medicine for Type 2 diab etes represents an evidence-inf ormed multifaceted behavioural
intervention targeting PA for manageme nt of type 2 diabetes developed for del ivery in primary care. The structured
development process undertaken enhances transparency of intervention content, replicability and scalability. Movement
as Medicine for Type 2 diabetes is currently undergoing evaluation in a pilot RCT.

Background
Effective management of type 2 diabetes poses a significant
medical, behavioural and public health challenge, particu-
larly with the projected increases in prevalence largely
attributable to an ageing population and unhealthy lifestyle
behaviours [1]. Type 2 diabetes is generally regarded as a
progressive condition [2]; however, a plethora of evidence
has demonstrated that a range of management options, in
particular lifestyle behaviour modification (e.g. physical ac-
tivity and diet), can result in improved glycaemic control
[3]. These in turn can decelerate, halt or even reverse the
progression of type 2 diabetes and significantly reduce the
risk of serious complications and premature mortality [4].
Physical activity (PA) is an effective management ap-
proach for long-term glycaemic control in adults with type
2d i a b e t e s[ 5 –8]. Yet, the majority of people with type 2
diabetes are physically inactive compared with national
norms [9]. UK guidelines indicate the need for patient
education models for the management of type 2 diabetes
[10] and recommend that people with type 2 diabetes are
offered some form of education/intervention at least at
the point of diagnosis. However, this is not available uni-
versally and, where this is available, the length, informa-
tion content and style of the interventions vary greatly
between services. Despite being an important part of self-
management, PA advice and concomitant interventions
are frequently omitted from management plans for people
with type 2 diabetes in the primary care setting [11].
As primary care is the main setting for the majority of
type 2 diabetes healthcare, it is arguably the optimal set-
ting for targeting PA where multiple opportunities exist
for the delivery of effective interventions by primary
healthcare professionals. However, there remains a lack of
evidence-informed interventions targeting PA that can be
offered to people with type 2 diabetes during routine pri-
mary care consultations. Furthermore, healthcare profes-
sionals often report difficulties in supporting their patients
to increase their everyday levels of PA [12] largely due to
lack of training in lifestyle behaviour change [13, 14]. With
traditional clinician-led advice-giving and direct persua-
sion approaches being ineffective for a large proportion of
patients [13], behavioural interventions that can increasePA to a degree sufficient to have a clinically significant im-
pact on glycaemic control in the long-term are needed.
The majority of available interventions do not include
adequate support to help people with type 2 diabetes to
achieve PA recommendations; very few have been formally
evaluated and rarely have the individuals responsible for
the delivery of these interventions been formally trained
for this purpose [14].
Currently available structured type 2 diabetes pro-
grammes (e.g. Diabetes Education and Self-Management
for Ongoing and Diagnosed (DESMOND) and the X-
PERT Diabetes Programme) have demonstrated effective-
ness for increasing self-efficacy [15] and improving gly-
caemic control [16]. However, these programmes require
referral, regularly have protracted waiting lists and are not
available to primary care practices in all areas of UK. Fur-
thermore, primary healthcare professionals do not receive
training to provide follow-up support. Therefore, there
remains a pressing need for an intervention that (1) is
available to all patients with type 2 diabetes and is available
when required (i.e. at key teachable moments within pri-
mary care appointments); (2) provides primary healthcare
professionals with the skills they require to successfully tar-
get PA during routine diabetes care; (3) provides patients
with the support and resources to effectively increase their
levels of PA in the context of their everyday lives and (4)
can be delivered within the primary care setting.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for
the development and evaluation of complex interventions
highlights the need to clearly describe the intervention de-
velopment process and describes four phases: development
(identify the evidence base, identify and develop theory
and model processes and outcomes); feasibility/piloting
(test intervention components and processes, estimate
recruitment/retention and determine sample size); evalu-
ation (assess effectiveness and understand processes of
change) and implementation (dissemination, surveillance/
monitoring and long-term follow-up) [17, 18]. Behaviour
change interventions are, by t heir nature, complex because
they contain multiple components; however, details of the
development process and reporting on specific details about
their content are often lacking [19, 20]. This is problematicAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 2 of 21
when trying to replicate interventions or when trying to
identify what active ingredien ts contribute to their accept-
ability, feasibility and effectiv eness. This paper describes the
application of the MRC ’s framework to the development of
Movement as Medicine for Type 2 diabetes, a theory-
informed multifaceted behavioural intervention to increase
PA of adults with type 2 diabetes in routine primary care.
The intervention is multifaceted as it comprises of two
facets or ‘levels ’. The first is an online training intervention
programme that aims to provide healthcare professionals
with the skills required to target PA behaviour change of
their patients during consultations. The second is a set of
resources (i.e. a patient DVD, pedometer and paper-based
materials) designed for delivery by a healthcare professional
to support patients to make changes to their PA levels.
We previously published a study protocol [21] that de-
scribed the methodology for an open pilot study (phase 1)
and pilot RCT (phase 2) of a multifaceted behavioural
intervention. The current paper supplements the protocol
with a comprehensive description of the intervention de-
velopment process. This includes how the intervention
content was iteratively designed with reference to patient
and healthcare professional ’s views and perspectives identi-
fied from the findings of exploratory work, usability testing
and the mixed methods open pilot study.
Methods
A four-stage systematic development process was under-
taken (see Fig. 1) to develop a multifaceted PA behavioural
intervention with reference to three phases: pre-clinical
(theoretical —exploratory work with patients and health-
care professionals), modelling (phase I —systematic review
with meta- and moderator analyses and usability testing of
an alpha prototype with patients and healthcare profes-
sionals) and exploratory trial (phase II —mixed methods
open pilot study with fidelity assessment). The aim was to
develop a behaviour change intervention that (1) fulfilled
the needs of both primary healthcare professionals and
adults with type 2 diabetes; (2) was evidence- and theory-
informed; (3) could be successfully integrated into routine
primary care and (4) could be appropriately evaluated.
Stage 1: exploratory work
The need for a multifaceted behavioural intervention origi-
nated from a local Primary Care Trust that had identified
training for primary healthca re professionals on PA behav-
iour change as a priority area. Therefore, key informant
general practitioners (GPs) from practices within the Trust
area and patients were initially consulted by engaging them
in a co-development process. The aim was to explore the
views and experiences of each group to inform the content
and mode of delivery of an intervention designed to effect-
ively target PA in the primary care setting.Exploratory work with primary healthcare professionals
A purposive sample of four GPs from four primary care
practices in North East England participated in a semi-
structured interview to gain in-depth information from key
informants (three were specialists in diabetes and all four
took overall responsibility for diabetes care and training
provision within their primary care practices) on current
practices and needs related to a more effective delivery of
PA interventions. A topic guide was used to elicit informa-
tion on how patients from each practice typically received
their diabetes education and advice on PA (at what time
points following diagnosis); to what extent participating
GPs believed patients engaged with the process of diabetes
supported self-management; a pproaches they currently use
to target PA during diabetes review clinics and their views
on whether they felt they were effective. Information was
also obtained on their prefer ences for mode of training and
intervention delivery and the amount of time available to
complete training within a typ ical working week. All inter-
views were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and ana-
lysed using content analysis [22].
Key findings of exploratory work with GPs In general,
prescribing medication was considered a more attractive
and effective option than promoting PA behaviour change
for adults with type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle behaviour change
was considered to be the most difficult part of diabetes
management, with GPs reliant on advice-giving and lim-
ited to providing specific suggestions to patients in terms
of activity type and frequency (e.g. walking for 30 min
three times per week).
GPs were knowledgeable about the underlying physio-
logical mechanisms of type 2 diabetes but frequently
experienced difficulty with communicating this complex
information to patients. Furthe rmore, they expressed dissat-
isfaction that many of their patients do not act upon their
advice about increasing their PA levels. As such, they stated
that a different approach was desirable to effectively com-
municate information about diabetes to patients, including
the benefits of leading a physical ly active lifestyle that would
be more amenable to patients ’personal situations. They
reported patients typically adopting a passive role during
consultations, with a relucta n c et oe n g a g ei nd i s c u s s i o n s
about self-management of their diabetes and other comor-
bidities by changing their lifestyle behaviour. The latter was
interpreted by GPs as patients failing to take responsibility .
Structured diabetes educatio n at the point of diagnosis was
offered to patients often by referral to a programme such as
Diabetes Education and Self -Management for Ongoing and
Newly Diagnosed (DESMOND) or X-Pert [15, 16]. How-
ever, GPs indicated that many of their patients preferred
not to take advantage of this service and also frequently did
not attend scheduled diabetes review appointments.Avery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 3 of 21
Important considerations emerged in the context of GPs ’
training needs, including being able to plan a programme
of training in advance to feed into the annual appraisal of
practice for GPs, and for the training to be evidence-based
and accredited for the purposes of continuing professional
development. Time for training was described as ‘limited ’,
although an online programme that allowed healthcare
professionals to work through the content on multiple oc-
casions over a specified period of time was considered to

emphasised (i.e. the need for tools to achieve this) as a
starting point for discussion about PA behaviour change.
Exploratory work identified a need for a training
programme designed to increas e healthcare professionals ’
awareness of the value of PA as a management option for
type 2 diabetes (i.e. it was reported that diet was targeted
more consistently than PA due to the lack of knowledge
about the type, duration and frequency of PA to recommend
to patients). Furthermore, the focus of the training shouldFig. 1 Overview of the intervention development process undertaken to develop the theory-informed multifaceted behavioural interventionAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 4 of 21
be on skills development in the context of PA for type 2 dia-
betes utilising evidence-based health behaviour change strat-
egies. There was consensus amongst the GPs interviewed
that an online training programme would allow flexibility
and demonstrate new ways to communicate to patients
about diabetes, in particular, why it progresses without ap-
propriate management and ho w patients can self-manage
their diabetes effectively by increasing their PA behaviour.
The GPs who participated in the initial exploratory
work did not take part in the subsequent developmental
stages as we wanted to obtain views and feedback from a
range of healthcare professionals throughout the devel-
opment process.
Exploratory work with adult patients with type 2 diabetes
An interactive workshop involving six adults with type 2
diabetes aged ≥65 years with a median time since diag-
nosis of 11 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 8) was
facilitated by two of the authors (LT and ML) to gain in-
sights into their lived experience of diabetes, as well as
identifying areas of care delivery from their perspective
to consider for inclusion in the facet of the intervention
for primary healthcare professionals. The benefits of the
group-based workshops were that participants could ask
the group questions and facilitators could immediately
clarify any queries and provide feedback in order gain an
in-depth understanding of the multiplicity of thoughts,
feelings and views about a specific topic, which were
more likely to be elicited in a social setting involving
direct interaction. Therefore, the workshop was used as
a vehicle to explore patients ’views and perspectives on
the following diabetes-related topics: the value of the in-
formation provided by primary healthcare professionals
on diabetes; support needs to effectively manage their
diabetes by increasing PA levels; whether they believed a
family history of diabetes influenced their knowledge
about the condition and the role of lifestyle behaviour
change; who they would contact to request information
and support about type 2 diabetes when required; how
well informed they were about the use of PA as a man-
agement option for their diabetes and how much infor-
mation and support had they had received previously to
increase their everyday levels of PA and whether they
felt this was beneficial.
Following the initial group discussions, patients were
asked to complete a ‘My Diabetes Story ’worksheet (see
Additional file 1) designed to elicit reflection on the high
and low points of living with type 2 diabetes, and a ‘Circle
of Influence ’worksheet (see Additional file 2) used to map
the most influential people (healthcare professionals and
others) in the context of their diabetes care. The completed
worksheets were subsequently used as prompts for group
discussion on the challenges of living with and successfully
managing type 2 diabetes, as well as their experiences ofreceiving diabetes care from primary healthcare profes-
sionals. Finally, participants were asked to complete a work-
sheet exercise designed to identi fy the key characteristics of
a good health professional (see Additional file 3).
Given the varied nature of the interactive workshop
(i.e. a series of structured exercises as well as verbal
feedback), the session was not audio recorded. Instead,
one of the two facilitators (LT) conducting the session
made detailed field notes. Responses from the structured
exercises and field notes on salient points were subjected
to content analysis by the two workshop facilitators.
Key findings of exploratory work with adults with
type 2 diabetes Patients reported feeling that the primary
healthcare professionals they had initial contact with fol-
lowing their diagnosis were not particularly knowledgeable
about type 2 diabetes. As such, they felt unable to discuss
their condition in any significant depth; for example, one
patient stated that a practice nurse was unsure about what
represented a normal HbA1c level. Patients reported edu-
cating themselves, their GP or a practice nurse about their
condition and effective self-management strategies. One
patient felt that secondary care provided a better service
in terms of the level of support provided for their diabetes
management.
A variety of experiences when receiving a diagnosis of
type 2 diabetes was described by patients. A common
scenario was that GPs would refer to the possibility of dia-
betes without explaining the condition or the implications
it may have for the patient. Subsequently, participants
were referred to a different primary healthcare professional
for confirmation. Participants expressed the opinion that
diabetes appeared to be a low priority for their primary
care practice. One factor contributing to this belief was
that diabetes review clinics were generally nurse-led, as op-
posed to GP-led.
Five of the six patients reported being advised to ‘lose
weight ’,‘change their diet ’or‘exercise more ’although
they were not offered any specific support or advice on
how to achieve this in the context of their everyday lives.
When asked ‘what makes a good healthcare professional
in the context of diabetes? ’, participants referred consist-
ently to healthcare professionals ’knowledge of diabetes.
Some held the belief that the ‘new breed ’of younger
healthcare professionals were more likely to communicate
with their patients as equals compared to the so-called old
school doctors, and this was regarded as a positive step
forward.
While exploring family history and in the context of their
knowledge of diabetes, patients stated that it was inevitable
that they would develop the condition; although for some,
the diagnosis still came as a surp rise. Their expectation was
that their diabetes would likely progress in the same way as
their parents (or other close relatives) despite their beliefAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 5 of 21
that diabetes treatment had vastly improved. When asked
w h ot h e yw o u l dv i s i ta saf i r s tp o r to fc a l lf o ri n f o r m a t i o n
about their diabetes, the majority relied on friends with dia-
betes or information they came across in the media or
press. Several patients were determined to gather as much
information as they could about their diabetes, whereas
others were unwilling to question the information and ad-
vice given to them in person by healthcare professionals.
There was consensus amongst the patients that they
could not recall receiving any direct information about
the potential of PA as a management option for type 2
diabetes from primary care teams. This is despite several
patients having an awareness and knowledge of the value
of increased PA or exercise for glycaemic control. When
asked what advice they had been given specifically about
PA, patients could not recall any specific examples (other
than being advised to simply take plenty of exercise) or
receiving any specific information/guidance on recom-
mended levels, type and duration of PA, including prac-
tical hints and tips on how to successfully increase their
PA levels.
Patient preferences on how they would like to receive
information on diabetes-related topics (and more specific-
ally PA as a management option for diabetes, including
their preferences on mode of delivery) were for printed
booklets/leaflets and a DVD (all patients reported owning a
DVD player). Despite reporting in some cases their dissatis-
faction with the information they had received previously
in primary care settings, a strong preference was elicited
from patients for face-to-face d elivery by a knowledgeable
and respectful primary healthcare professional.
Conclusions of exploratory work
The findings of the exploratory work were summarised
and discussed within the research team. The exploratory
work highlighted a need to focus on training provision for
healthcare professionals to equip them with the knowledge
and skills to target PA behaviour of their patients. An
online training programme was developed in accordance
with GPs stated preference for mode of delivery and the
need for flexibility. Consequently, the online programme
was presented in a modular format to allow flexibility of
completion in small manageable sections in order to maxi-
mise successful integration within a typical primary care
environment.
The training needs of primary healthcare professionals
were identified in terms of different types, intensities
and duration of PA/exercise on health outcomes, in par-
ticular, glycaemic control; the physiological effects of a
physically active lifestyle in the context of type 2 diabetes
and effective communication of this information to patients;
and the utilisation of evidence-based behaviour change strat-
egies to facilitate person-centr ed discussions with patients
about increasing and maintaining PA behaviour. In general,healthcare professionals reported lacking confidence in dis-
cussing lifestyle issues with their patients, primarily due to
frustration resulting from numerous unsuccessful past at-
tempts. Modules on each of these topics were developed for
inclusion in the online training programme.
Adults with type 2 diabetes expressed a strong prefer-
ence for individual face-to-face sessions with healthcare
professionals who were knowledgeable about diabetes.
Paper-based resources and a DVD were identified as feas-
ible methods for conveying information about diabetes
and providing support to patients. The latter finding was
attributable to participants either not having access to or
being unfamiliar with how to access or navigate the Inter-
net; although they reported familiarity and access to a
DVD player.
Development of an alpha prototype intervention
The views and experiences of participants in the explora-
tory work provided an initial indication of the mode, form
and information content of an alpha prototype multifa-
ceted intervention for further refinement in subsequent
stages of the co-development process: (1) an online train-
ing programme for healthcare professionals to develop
their knowledge and skills and (2) a suite of paper-based
patient resources for use by healthcare professionals and
patients during routine diabetes review appointments.
These draft resources were designed to help patients to
develop knowledge and skills for using PA as a vehicle for
diabetes self-management. In addition, a DVD was designed
to provide information to supplement and/or reinforce key
information outside of consultations. The DVD included
narratives of people with type 2 diabetes who had success-
fully increased their levels of PA with some practical hints
and tips on how this could be achieved.
The specific evidence-informed information content of
the behaviour change components of the alpha proto-
type PA behavioural intervention were further refined in
stage 2 of the development process.
Stage 2: identification of behaviour change techniques,
theoretical basis, intervention intensity and duration
Prior to embarking on the development of a new interven-
tion, the MRC framework encourages researchers to iden-
tify what is already known about other similar interventions
(e.g. their theoretical processes of change) by drawing on
existing evidence. Despite t he growing number of RCTs
examining the effect of behaviour change interventions on
PA behaviour of adults with type 2 diabetes, a systematic
review examining the pooled effect size of these studies on
PA behaviour and glycaemic control had not been pub-
lished. Stage 2 of the intervention development process
involved a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess
the effectiveness of PA behaviour change interventions for
long-term glycaemic control and identification of candidateAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 6 of 21
behaviour change techniques and other intervention fea-
tures associated with improved glycaemic control.
Systematic review with meta- and moderator analyses
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 RCTs was
conducted to assess whether behavioural interventions
were more effective than usual clinical care for increasing
PA and improving glycaemic control in a sample of 1975
adults with type 2 diabetes [14]. In summary, we demon-
strated that behavioural interventions (when compared to
usual care) delivered in clinical and community settings
are effective for increasing objectively assessed PA and for
yielding a clinically significant improvement in long-term
glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c ( −0.32 %, 95 %
CI =−0.44 to −0.21 %).
A pooled effect size does not provide any indication of
what components (i.e. active ingredients) of the interven-
tions are associated with effectiveness. Therefore, a series
of moderator analyses of the 17 studies included in the
systematic review was conducted to inform selection of
behaviour change techniques (using a comprehensive and
reliable taxonomy [23]) and other intervention features
(e.g. mode of delivery, use of theory) associated with in-
creases in clinically significant improvements in HbA1c
(i.e. 0.3 % reduction) when present (as opposed to absent)
in the studies reviewed. Studies utilised in the systematic
review included both subjective and objective methods of
free-living PA/exercise assessment. Moreover, it was not
possible to establish the type, intensity and frequency of
PA/exercise attributable to the effect sizes observed.
Therefore, we made the decision to identify behaviour
change techniques (BCTs) associated with clinically sig-
nificant improvements in HbA1c to maximise the likeli-
hood of increasing PA/exercise to a level sufficient to
impact on glycaemic control.
Selection of behaviour change techniques and other
intervention features
Moderator analyses identified ten behaviour change tech-
niques for inclusion in the alpha prototype PA behaviour
intervention. These were prompting generalisation of a
target behaviour, use of follow-up prompts, prompt review
of behavioural goals, provide information on where and
when to perform PA, plan social support/social change,
goal setting behaviour, time management, prompting focus
on past success, barrier identification/problem-solving and
provide information on the consequences of behaviour to
the individual.
Other intervention features identified from moderator
analyses were the inclusion of ten or more behaviour
change techniques: intervent ions underpinned by a theory/
model of behaviour change and intervention durations of
≥6 months. Contrary to expect ations, moderator analyses
suggested that different modes of intervention delivery,interventions utilising pedomet ers, interventions of greater
intensity (greater to of equal to a median of 14 patient
contacts) and inclusion of a supervised PA or exercise com-
ponent were not associated with clinically significant im-
provements in HbA1c.
Following a wider appraisal of t he evidence base, a further
three behaviour change techni ques that were shown to have
a neutral effect in the moderator analyses (i.e. they had a
positive association with HbA1c when both are present and
absent) were included in the intervention: provide feedback
on performance, relapse prevention/coping planning and
rewards contingent on effort /progress made towards PA
behaviour. These were included for pragmatic reasons to
provide a balance of motivation al and volitional behaviour
change techniques to support intention formation and to
promote maintenance of PA behaviour [24].
Given that moderator analyses could not test associa-
tions between different combinations of behaviour
change techniques, it was considered important to in-
clude combinations of techniques with strong evidence
for increasing PA from the wider research literature.
Therefore, a further two behaviour change techniques,
action planning and prompt self-monitoring of behav-
iour, were selected for inclusion in the intervention
despite the overall effect on HbA1c being larger when
these techniques were absent. Two published reviews
reported that inclusion of self-regulatory techniques
such as self-monitoring in PA behaviour change inter-
ventions improved effectiveness [25, 26]. Furthermore,
PA interventions are reported to be optimised when
self-monitoring is utilised and combined with at least
one other self-regulatory technique [27]. A pedometer
was included in the intervention (despite exploratory
moderator analyses indicating that interventions in-
cluding these devices were not associated with clinically
significant improvements in HbA1c) to augment self-
monitoring of PA behaviour (i.e. as means for partici-
pants to record their progress on activity planners) and
strong evidence from the wider research that pedome-
ters significantly increase PA behaviour [28].
Similarly, interventions utilising action planning and
coping planning in combination were found to predict
increases in PA [29]. Moreover, the inclusion of both
action planning and coping planning at various stages
of the behaviour change process (motivational and vol-
itional) is reported to be an optimal strategy to employ
when targeting PA behav iour change [30, 31].
The moderator analyses indicated that the interven-
tion duration should be ≥6 months (i.e. patients should
be supported to increase their levels of PA for at least
6 months). In the absence of explicit guidance from the
systematic review findings regarding the mode of deliv-
ery of the intervention, the decision to use individual
face-to-face sessions with a healthcare professional andAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 7 of 21
patient was guided by the preferences expressed by pa-
tients during the exploratory phase (stage 1).
Theory selection
Moderator analyses suggested that interventions under-
pinned by a theory or model of behaviour change were as-
sociated with clinically significant improvements in
HbA1c). However, no single theory emerged as potentially
superior over another. Therefore, explicit selection criteria
were applied to inform theory selection. These included a
strong evidence base for modelling the process of interven-
tion components and outcomes that were the focus of the
intervention (i.e. changing c onsultation behaviour of pri-
mary healthcare professionals and increasing PA in adults
with type 2 diabetes). Furthermore, exploratory work
undertaken in stage 1 with prim ary healthcare professionals
and patients identified the need to target motivational fac-
tors (e.g. attitudes/beliefs re g a r d i n gt h eu s eo fP Ab yh e a l t h -
care professionals as a manag ement option for people with
type 2 diabetes) and volitional factors (e.g. self-efficacy to
increase and maintain increases in PA behaviour in adults
with type 2 diabetes and self-efficacy of healthcare profes-
sionals for delivering a behaviou ral intervention during rou-
tine primary care). Therefore, a dditional criteria for guiding
theory selection included a theory that incorporated both
motivational and volitional f actors [24] and the existence of
in-built constructs and/or ev idence-based strategies that
can be used to effectively targe t both motivation/intention
and actual PA behaviour to support maintenance. It was
also important to select a theory/theories that had readily
available, reliable and valid instruments to measure the the-
oretical constructs and postulated relationships between
the constructs to inform the evaluation of the intervention
in a planned pilot RCT.
In accordance with these criteria, the theory of planned
behaviour (TPB) [32] and social cognitive theory (SCT)
[33] were selected to inform the development and evalu-
ation of the intervention. Together with the theory-linked
behaviour change techniques identified by the moderator
analyses, the TPB and SCT provided a complimentary the-
oretical framework for guiding the development and sub-
sequent evaluation of the intervention. The TPB has been
extensively and successfully used to predict intentions to
increase PA and actual PA behaviour [34, 35] including
healthcare professional behaviour change [36]. However,
the TPB does not provide explicit guidance on how theor-
etical constructs can be targeted within interventions using
evidence-informed strategies or how to address the fre-
quent lack of concordance between motivation/intention
and action (i.e. the intention-behaviour gap) [37]. SCT is
able to provide specific evidence-based strategies for trans-
lating motivation/intentions into action/behaviour in both
healthcare professionals and patients (e.g. observational
learning strategies such as modelling to support theacquisition of behaviour change skills and self-efficacy
for the effective delivery of behaviour change tech-
niques to patients). Furthermore, SCT has demon-
strated utility in samples of people with diabetes when
predicting PA behaviour [38].
Defining and mapping the alpha prototype PA behaviour
intervention components
Guidance published by Davidson et al. [39] was followed
to ensure that intervention characteristics were described
appropriately when developing the alpha prototype PA be-
havioural intervention. These included intervention for-
mat, intensity, duration and information content. Findings
of the exploratory work and systematic review were used
collectively to inform decisions about the content and
mode of delivery of the alpha prototype intervention. A
taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [23] was used
throughout the intervention development process to en-
sure that techniques selected for inclusion in the interven-
tion were defined adequately and consistently.
Online training component Consistent with the needs
of primary healthcare professionals (identified in stage 1),
the training programme was designed as an online re-
source delivered in a modular format to facilitate flexibility
and accessibility. The training programme was accredited
by the Royal College of Physicians with completion of the
programme prompting generation of a certificate awarding
three continuing professional development points. This
fulfilled the GPs ’requirement for the training programme
to contribute towards their annual appraisal.
The content of the online training programme addressed
the knowledge and skills gaps identified during the explora-
tory phase (stage 1). Eight distinct but interrelated modules
were developed. Table 1 presents an overview of the infor-
mation content of each module and the relationships
between content and associated behaviour change tech-
niques, including their relat ionship with the theoretical
constructs of the TPB and SCT. Module 2 presented
healthcare professionals with information about study pro-
cedures and data collection that was initially provided as a
paper-based protocol during the consent process. As this
did not form part of the PA behaviour change intervention,
it is not presented in Table 1.
The behaviour change techniques selected for inclusion
in the patient toolkit component of the intervention were
covered in detail within the content of modules 6 and 7. A
series of audiovisual clips portrayed simulated interactions
between a diabetes specialist nurse and a patient. These
were used as a vehicle to demons trate to healthcare profes-
sionals how to use specific behaviour change techniques to
facilitate delivery of the patient toolkit.

interviewing (agenda setting, use of importance and con-
fidence rulers to engage participants in change talk, ac-
tive listening and informing) [40] were incorporated into
module 7. These specific counselling skills have evidence
for effectively engaging patients effectively in discussions
about behaviour change with healthcare professionals
[41]. They also serve as effective vehicles for placing the
patient at the centre of the decision-making process, and
as such, maintaining their autonomy when setting goals
for PA behaviour change.
Patient toolkit component The patient toolkit was de-
signed for delivery by healthcare professionals within
routine consultations to assist patients with type 2 dia-
betes to develop the knowledge and skills for effective
use of PA in the self-management of their condition.
The toolkit included (1) a discussion card comprised of
a 7-day recall used to gauge current levels and patterns
of PA, a decisional balance aid [42] to facilitate discus-
sions about pros and cons for changing PA behaviour
versus PA behaviour remaining the same, and readiness
rulers to gauge the importance of PA and confidence for
increasing PA [40]; (2) a booklet to support goal setting,
action planning and barrier identification/problem-solv-
ing [14]; (3) activity planners, trackers and a pedometer
(SW200, Yamax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to facilitate
time management and self-monitoring of PA; (4) a DVD
to promote observational learning and increase self-
efficacy; (5) a record of progress pad to guide healthcare
professionals through the process of intervention deliv-
ery and a mechanism for feedback provision to patients;
(6) a motivational postcard mailed out to patients at the
3-month time point to prompt PA behaviour; and (7)
and a Diabetes UK leaflet entitled ‘Keeping active: an es-
sential part of managing diabetes ’[43]. Table 2 provides
a synopsis of the patient toolkit resources and how their
form and information content mapped onto theoretical
constructs of TPB and SCT.
Following an initial discussion of current PA levels with
patients, healthcare professionals would select the most
appropriate behaviour change techniques (from those pre-
sented in modules 6 and 7 of the online programme) that
would allow them to tailor the delivery of the patient tool-
kit in accordance with an individual patient ’s needs. A
number of strategies are included to target motivation and
confidence to support intention formation (e.g. provision
of positive feedback on current levels of PA, a discussion
ofpros versus cons for increasing PA versus activity levels
staying the same, prompting focus on past success). Once
a patient forms an intention to change their level of PA, a
number of strategies are included in the process to help
them to translate an intention into action. These include
self-regulation strategies such as goal setting, action plan-
ning and self-monitoring. In addition, a range of behaviourchange counselling skills based on the principles of motiv-
ational interviewing [44] was integrated into the online
programme to engage patients in collaborative decision-
making with healthcare professionals.
Stage 3: assessing usability of the alpha prototype PA
behaviour intervention in primary care
Aims : To assess usability of the alpha prototype inter-
vention from the perspective of healthcare professionals,
data managers and adults with type 2 diabetes from one
primary care practice.
Methods: primary care staff
One diabetes nurse practitioner, two practice nurses and
three data/IT managers from one primary care practice
were given access to the alpha prototype PA behaviour
intervention. The aim was to elicit their views on the
relevance of the content and general usability of both
the online training programme and the patient toolkit
components. Although healthcare professionals were not
required to use the materials during consultations with
patients, they were asked to consider while reviewing
the intervention components whether they felt they
would work in practice and to report any barriers or
enabling factors to implementation. Data/IT managers
were asked to review the content of the online training
programme and to specifically identify any potential bar-
riers to implementation with their existing information
technology infrastructure.
Each usability testing partic ipant completed a structured
questionnaire asking specific questions about each module
in the online training programme (e.g. module 1: does this
module provide sufficient information about the purpose of
the programme?; how could this module be improved?).
Participants were also asked to rate the intervention on a
scale of 1 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied). Fol-
lowing a review of the responses from the questionnaire,
informal follow-up discussions were carried out with the
three healthcare professionals and one data/IT manager
(two IT managers opted out of the informal discussions as
they did not feel they could comment upon the use of the
intervention during routine c onsultations) to explore in
more depth the points raised in relation to their expecta-
tions and barriers/facilit ators to implementation.
Results of usability testing with primary care staff
Minor technical problems with the video footage (e.g. ini-
tial freezing of footage and incompatibility with early
versions of specific Internet browsers that were installed
onto practice computers) and interactive components of
the online training programme (e.g. issues with functional-
ity) were detected and subsequently resolved. Further
information content was requested on appropriate advice
to provide to people with comorbidities (e.g. arthritis)Avery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 10 of 21

when planning to undertake PA. This additional informa-
tion was subsequently added to module 5 of the online
training programme. Comments from primary care staff
and responses to the structured questionnaire (median
satisfaction score was 8.0; IQR 2.0) indicated that satisfac-
tion with both intervention components was high, and they
emphasised that they would u se the intervention and rec-
ommend it to colleagues. When asked how they would use
t h ep r o g r a m m e ,t h e ys u g g e s t e d that they would complete it
in full initially but would like to return to relevant sections
if and when required. Therefore, the need to have continu-
ous access to the online programme was emphasised.
Methods: usability testing with patients
Structured interviews were also conducted with 13 adults
with type 2 diabetes attending primary care diabetes
clinics at one primary care practice ( n= 8 males, n=5
females, mean age = 58 years (SD = 14), mean time since
diagnosis = 5 years (SD = 5)). Patients were approached
following their diabetes review appointment with a health-
care professional to assess the face and content validity of
the patient toolkit. During the interview, patients were
taken through a typical scenario with the toolkit to iden-
tify any content, design or usability issues. A structured
questionnaire requested information about their views on
each aspect of the toolkit, for example, ‘what, if anything
would make the activity planners easier to use? ’
Results of usability testing with patients
Although no significant issues were identified with the
content or usability of the patient toolkit, patients sug-
gested that the original ‘intervention task card ’design
should be redeveloped into a booklet format. They also
commented that pictures of physical activities should be
added to the reverse side of the toolkit case and that the
booklet should include provision to record appointment
dates and times, including space to make a note of any
questions to ask during subsequent appointments. Pa-
tients indicated that they would use the materials with
the support of a healthcare professional as a mechanism
to receive feedback and would be interested in taking
part in the programme. Mirroring the findings of the ini-
tial exploratory work, the latter was driven by a desire to
learn more about PA, as the majority of patients re-
ported that they did not recall having been advised spe-
cifically about PA to manage their diabetes or offered
support to increase their levels of PA to enable them to
self-manage their diabetes.
Stage 4: an open pilot study to assess acceptability and
feasibility in the primary care setting and to optimise
intervention components
Based on findings from the usability testing with health-
care professionals and patients, a beta prototype ofMovement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes was developed
for use in a subsequent open pilot study in the primary
care setting.
Design
A single-arm open pilot study with baseline and follow-up
assessment at 1 month was conducted in two primary prac-
tices in North East England. An open pilot study design
was selected to enable a preliminary assessment of accept-
ability, feasibility and fidelity of delivery and to facilitate
systematic adaptations and refinements of the intervention
while being used in a real-life setting [45]. Intervention
components were optimised t hroughout a 1-month inter-
vention period (baseline and 1 month diabetes review ap-
pointments) by monitoring access and use of the online
training programme by healthcar e professionals, theoretical
domain framework informe d interviews with primary
healthcare professionals and patients, and analysis of video
recordings of consultations to investigate fidelity of inter-
vention delivery by healthcare p rofessionals. By systematic-
ally collecting information and refining the intervention,
the aim was to optimise intervention components and
increase acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of delivery of
the intervention for use in the primary care setting ahead of
a planned pilot RCT.
Participants
Two primary care practices agreed to participate in the
pilot study who allocated six primary healthcare profes-
sionals (two GPs, three practice nurses, one healthcare
assistant) to participate in the study (see Fig. 2). One GP
and one practice nurse were specialists in diabetes. All six
healthcare professionals were female, aged 40 to 55 years
and had not previously received training on health psych-
ology theory and principles of health behaviour change in
general or specific to PA. However, two healthcare profes-
sionals reported having attended a workshop promoting
the use of PA in the primary care setting. None of the par-
ticipating healthcare professionals had previously been in-
volved in diabetes or PA research.
Out of 131 eligible patients invited to participate in the
open pilot study (79 and 52 from practices 1 and 2, respect-
ively), 30 (23 %) adults with non-insulin-dependent type 2
diabetes were recruited ( n= 18 from practice 1 and n=1 2
from practice 2). This sample size was consistent with the
standard guidance relating to sample size for pilot studies
[45, 46]. Patients were aged between 46 and 88 years (mean
68.9; SD 10.6); 60 % were male (M/F, 18/12); time since
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was between 2 and 28 years
(median 4.5; IQR 5.0); and 21 patients managed their dia-
betes with oral medication and 9 with diet. Patients man-
aged with insulin were excluded due to increased risk of
hypoglycaemia as a result of increased levels of PA.Avery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 12 of 21
Consent was obtained from primary healthcare profes-
sionals to complete the online training programme and to
subsequently deliver the intervention toolkit to patients re-
cruited to the study. Separate consent was given by health-
care professionals and patients for video recording of the
consultations to assess fidelity of delivery of behaviour
change techniques in practice and to take part in one or
more interviews with a researcher to identify barriers and
enabling factors to implementation of the intervention.
Data collection
Healthcare professionals were emailed a unique login ID
and link to the online training programme that had to be
completed before the delivery of the intervention to par-
ticipating patients. They were given 4 weeks to completethe training programme. Completion of all eight modules
of the programme was confirmed by generation of an elec-
tronic personalised certificat e. Usage of the online training
programme was monitored to es tablish whether healthcare
professionals completed the t raining programme within the
required time period (i.e. 4 weeks). Monitoring was also
used to establish whether the programme was revisited fol-
lowing initial completion and feasible for completion within
the primary care working environment.
Healthcare professionals were interviewed following com-
pletion of the online training programme and again follow-
ing the delivery of the intervention during baseline and 1-
month patient appointments. Interviews focused specifically
on the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, in-
cluding ways to increase impl ementation and refine studyFig. 2 Summary of practice, healthcare professional, patient recruitment and data collection activityAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 13 of 21
processes and procedures. The interview topic guides were
developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)
[47]. The TDF is the result of a multi-disciplinary expert
consensus approach that aimed to organise and simplify the
theoretical literature on behaviour change by reviewing 33
behavioural theories. The 128 key constructs were organised
into broad theoretical domains based on commonalities
[48]. The TDF consists of 14 theory domains each providing
broad explanations of why a behaviour may or may not have
been performed: knowledge; skills; professional role and
identity; beliefs about capabi lities; optimism; beliefs about
consequences; reinforcement; intentions; goals; memory,
attention and decision processes; environmental context and
resources; social influences; emotions; and behavioural regu-
lation [47]. This approach enabled a range of personal, pro-
fessional and environmental challenges to implementation
of the intervention to be explored.
Although the TDF is not a theory, it enables the inter-
view findings to be linked back to theory to facilitate an
understanding of the behaviour change processes that
were inhibitors or drivers of implementation. Theory-
driven refinements could then be made to optimise the
intervention content and processes (i.e. domain-specific
beliefs informed changes/improvements to intervention
components) that were congruent with the TPB and
SCT used to develop the intervention components (de-
scribed in stages 1 to 3). It was used to identify domain-
specific issues with the online training programme and
delivery of the patient toolkit (e.g. knowledge/skills/sup-
port gaps).
Acceptability and feasibility of the patient toolkit from
the perspective of patients were assessed using TDF-
informed semi-structured interviews to establish com-
prehension, acceptability and feasibility of the toolkit
and to detect any domain-specific issues (e.g. informa-
tion/support gaps). Interviews were conducted with
patients immediately following their diabetes review ap-
pointments incorporating the intervention at baseline
and 1-month follow-up.
The TDF was used to identify domain-specific beliefs
likely to positively or negatively impact on acceptability
and feasibility of the intervention in the primary care
setting and to inform intervention optimisation.
Assessing fidelity of delivery of intervention components by
healthcare professionals
Fidelity of delivery of the intervention components was
assessed to facilitate optimisation of the intervention (i.e.
to identify specific intervention components that did not
translate well into practice) and to enable adaptations to
be made to the intervention to improve implementation
[49]. Failure to assess fidelity of delivery of intervention
components could potentially lead to false conclusions
regarding the effectiveness or ineffectiveness ofinterventions. Effectiveness may be due to non-
intervention factors and failure of interventionists to de-
liver intervention components in accordance with the
protocol. Fidelity of delivery assessment is critically im-
portant because there is a risk that ineffective interven-
tions are adopted into clinical settings in place of
potentially effective interventions [49, 50]. In order to as-
sess whether the patient toolkit intervention could be con-
sistently and faithfully delivered in the primary care
setting by healthcare professionals, a fidelity checklist was
constructed to assess the presence and absence of specific
intervention content (behaviour change techniques) being
delivered in accordance with intervention protocol. Where
intervention components were more frequently omitted,
adaptations to the intervention were made to improve fi-
delity of delivery following completion of the 1-month
appointments.
Data analyses
Descriptive statistics (median and IQR, minimum and
maximum values) were calculated for time spent (in mi-
nutes) by healthcare professionals to complete the online
training programme and over what period of time (e.g.,
seven consecutive or non-consecutive days). In addition,
data were collected to determine whether healthcare
professionals revisited the online training programme
post-completion and how much time they spent brows-
ing the programme in minutes (median and IQR, mini-
mum and maximum values). These analyses allowed an
assessment of feasibility (i.e. whether healthcare profes-
sionals could complete the online training within the
time permitted or whether modifications were required)
and acceptability (i.e. whether healthcare professionals
were willing to use the online training programme and
return to the programme throughout the intervention
period).
TDF-informed interview transcripts with healthcare
professionals ( n= 9) and patients ( n= 14) were content
analysed [22] independently by the first author (LA) using
NVivo 10 [51] and the TDF and its constructs as a coding
frame. Twelve of the 23 transcripts were independently
coded and content analysed by a second researcher (SJC).
The first TDF-informed interview transcript generated
was independently coded by both researchers and dis-
cussed (to ensure consiste ncy) before coding subse-
quent transcripts. Regular meetings were held between
the two researchers where discrepancies were resolved
via discussion. Data saturation was defined in accord-
ance with published research evidence for theory-based
interviewing [52].
Video recordings of consultations between healthcare
professionals and patients ( N= 32) were coded by two of
the three researchers (LA, SD, KK) using a fidelity check-
list to ensure reliability. All three coders had expertise inAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 14 of 21
health behaviour change and experience of using the 40-
item taxonomy [23] utilised throughout the intervention
development process. While reviewing the video footage
of each consultation, two coders independently recorded
each intervention component as ‘yes’(delivered) or ‘no’
(not delivered). Disagreements were resolved via discus-
sion with the third researcher while revisiting video foot-
age where discrepancies existed.
Results
Time spent completing the online training programme and
modules reviewed post-training by primary healthcare
professionals
All six healthcare professionals logged on and accessed
the online training programme. They spent a median of
3 h and 35 min browsing the programme up to the point
of completion (i.e. when a certificate was generated) over
a median period of 5.5 days (see Table 3). The median
time spent using the programme post-completion was
58 min over a median period of 4 days.
Healthcare professional perspectives: identification of
domain-specific beliefs that impact upon acceptability
and feasibility of the intervention
Barriers to acceptability and fe asibility of the intervention
from the perspective of healthcare professionals were asso-
ciated with six theoretical domains. These were memory,
attention and decision processe s (i.e. difficulties recalling
specific components of the intervention); optimism (i.e. that
the intervention is unlikely to help change PA behaviour of
patients); environmental context and resources (i.e. lack of
time to complete training and practice intervention deliv-
ery); social influences (i.e. improving diabetes care is con-
sidered to be a practice norm and something healthcare
professionals are already doing ); professional role and iden-
tity (i.e. belief that nurses and not GPs should be delivering
the intervention); and beliefs about consequences (i.e. the
intervention will only work with a minority of patients).
A total of 25 domain-specific beliefs across all 14 TDF
domains were found to positively influence acceptability
and feasibility of the intervention in the primary care
setting. The most frequently reported domains includedknowledge (i.e. completing the online training programme
has improved knowledge of diabetes and the value of PA
for glycaemic control); skills (i.e. the training programme
has facilitated acquisition of behaviour change skills); be-
liefs about capabilities (i.e. practice delivering the inter-
vention to patients will make it easier to use); intentions
(i.e. completing the training programme has increased the
likelihood that PA will be targeted in future consultations);
and optimism (i.e. practice will improve delivery of the
intervention during routine consultations and lead to
beneficial changes in patient behaviour).
Patient perspectives: identification of domain-specific
beliefs that impact on acceptability and feasibility of the
intervention
Barriers to acceptability and feasibility of the interven-
tion from the perspective of patients were associated
with three theoretical domains. These were memory,
attention and decision processes (i.e. it takes time to
fully understand the nature of the intervention and its
components); environmental context and resources (i.e.
a period of ill health or adverse health events could cre-
ate barriers to increasing levels of PA); and social influ-
ences (i.e. a preference to complete the programme
alone/privately without social support).
A total of 40 domain-specific beliefs from across all 14
domains of the TDF were found to impact positively on
acceptability and feasibility of the intervention by patients.
Ten theoretical domains were most frequently reported:
knowledge (i.e. the intervention increased knowledge and
awareness of the benefits of PA for management of type 2
diabetes); skills (i.e. the intervention equipped patients
with the self-management skills to plan, monitor and over-
come barriers to PA); beliefs about capabilities (i.e. increas-
ing the levels of PA was not as difficult as anticipated
when using the intervention); beliefs about consequences
(i.e. increasing the levels of PA will have important health
benefits); optimism (i.e. the intervention will help to in-
crease and maintain the levels of PA); reinforcement (i.e.
feedback and social support from healthcare professionals
during consultations is an incentive to taking part); inten-
tions (i.e. the intentions to attempt to increase the levels of
PA have become stronger as a result of the intervention);
goals (i.e. setting personal goals is an important aspect of
the intervention); social influences (i.e. practical and emo-
tional support from healthcare professionals at the primary
care practice is important for maintaining motivation); and
behavioural regulation (i.e. self-monitoring activity levels
have facilitated an increase in PA).

was 0.60 and 0.55, respectively, indicating moderate
agreement.
Assessment of video recordings revealed that the ma-
jority of behaviour change techniques and other inter-
vention components (i.e. agenda setting, discussion of
pros versus cons for increasing PA, and utilisation of im-
portance and confidence rulers) were delivered faithfully
during baseline and 1-month follow-up appointments
for the majority of the time. The intervention compo-
nents frequently not delivered when it would have been
appropriate to deliver them included agenda setting; dis-
cussion of pros versus cons for increasing PA; barrier
identification and problem-solving; prompt focus on past
success; prompt rewards contingent on progress and
time management. The behaviour change technique re-
view of behavioural goals was, as expected, omitted from
all baseline consultations but delivered during 15 of the
17 1-month follow-up consultations. The behaviour
change technique prompt generalisation of PA behaviour
was not delivered during baseline or 1-month follow-up
consultations.
Patient and healthcare professional perspectives: how the
data obtained informed intervention optimisation to
improve acceptability and feasibility of the intervention
Analyses of data collected during the open pilot study
indicated that the intervention was acceptable and feas-
ible for use with healthcare professionals and patients.
The data were subsequently used to inform a number of
refinements to intervention components and processes
to improve acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of deliv-
ery during the pilot RCT. An overview of these refine-
ments to the intervention components is presented in
Table 4.
Healthcare professionals and patients in the open pilot
study continued onto the pilot RCT. Healthcare profes-
sionals were asked to revisit the training programme to
view content added as an outcome of the open pilot
study and deliver the intervention to patients during the
6- and 12-month diabetes review appointments (i.e. 6-
and 12-month follow-up). An illustration of the Move-
ment as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes intervention, fol-
lowing revisions, is presented in Fig. 3.
Discussion
This paper presents a systematic, theory and evidence-
informed approach to developing a multifaceted behav-
ioural intervention for use by healthcare professionals
(GPs, practice nurses and healthcare assistants) to pro-
mote PA as an effective component of self-management
amongst adults with type 2 diabetes in the primary care
setting.
The systematic intervention development process ad-
dressed an important criticism of previous behaviourchange interventions targeting PA —the absence of a de-
tailed description of the rationale for selecting theory,
information content, duration and intensity of interven-
tions that prohibits replication [23]. Adherence to the
MRC framework to guide the development of Move-
ment as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes provides an audit
trail for the provenance of the intervention ’s facets (on-
line training programme and patient toolkit). Moreover,
meaningful involvement of healthcare professionals and
patients in an iterative and co-development process pro-
vides evidence that Movement as Medicine for Type 2
Diabetes (mode, form and information content) is sensi-
tive to their preferences and the context of intervention
delivery, which can enhance implementation and uptake
in the clinical setting. A further strength of our approach
was the use of a taxonomy [23] to ensure that behaviour
change techniques were defined consistently throughout
the intervention development process.
The findings of the systematic review and meta-
analyses were instrumental in establishing a robust
rationale for the development of a theory-informed
behaviour change intervention targeting PA of adults
with type 2 diabetes in community and clinical settings
with the use of behavioural strategies. Furthermore, it
highlighted the importance of providing evidence-based
skills development training to healthcare professionals
to facilitate delivery of intervention content.
While a prodigious amount of work has gone into eluci-
dating a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques, there
has been less attention directed towards effective strategies
to provide interventionists with the knowledge and skills
required to deliver theory-linked behaviour change tech-
niques as described in the taxonomy. The current study
adds to the evidence base by providing a theory-based
means of operationalising the prerequisite of behaviour
change skills required and conveying this audiovisually via
an online intervention (training programme) to support
‘vicarious skills development ’. Furthermore, the online
training intervention programme provides an important
proof of concept for the delivery of behaviour change tech-
niques by non-psychologists, which reflects one of the key
aims of the behaviour change technique taxonomy [23].
The feasibility and acceptability of the online training
intervention programme for improving the knowledge
and skills of primary healthcare professionals were con-
sistent with a Cochrane review published in 2013 on a
digital/Internet-based PA behaviour change interven-
tions [53]. Another systematic review published in 2010
of Internet-based health behaviour change interven-
tions reported that such interventions had small but
significant effects on health behaviour, although interven-
tions underpinned by the TPB and those incorporating
more behaviour change techniques and using additional
methods of communicating (e.g. text messaging) wereAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 16 of 21
reported to have larger effects [53]. These findings support
the decision to utilise the TPB to underpin the intervention
and add to the evidence base for Internet-based interven-
tions to support professional behaviour change [54]. How-
ever, in acknowledgment of the limitations of the TPB,
specifically in relation to its utility for developing interven-
tion content [55], we engaged he althcare professionals and
patients in an iterative development process. This helped to
identify acceptable and feasibl e ways of operationalising the-
oretical constructs from the TPB and SCT (and specific
BCTs) to ensure that the inter vention mode, form and con-
tent were optimally sensitive to the study context.
An assessment of fidelity of intervention delivery by
healthcare professionals addressed an important methodo-
logical issue in the behaviour change literature. That is
whether intervention components can be deliveredfaithfully by interventionists within the constraints of the
target setting. We were able to demonstrate that ‘enact-
ment ’of intervention knowledge and skills (i.e. specific be-
haviour change techniques) in the primary care setting can
be attributed to the completion of the evidence-based on-
line training programme, described as the theoretically ex-
pected treatment effects in the MRC framework [18, 23].
The use of an open pilot study design enabled the
gathering of feedback from healthcare professionals and
patients throughout an active intervention period [23].
While early development work is essential to make im-
portant decisions about intervention content and mode of
delivery, often, implementation issues cannot be identified
until the intervention is utilised in practice. Therefore, the
open pilot study design allowed the intervention to be
‘tested ’and refined ahead of a planned pilot RCT involvingTable 4 An overview of modifications made to the Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes multifaceted intervention
Revision Source of data that informed revision Justification for revision
Removal of the behaviour change
technique ‘rewards contingent on
progress towards behaviour ’Semi-structured interviews with healthcare
professionals and patients and video
recordings of consultationsSeveral attempts were made by healthcare professionals to
deliver the technique; however, faithful delivery and quality
of delivery emerged as ongoing issues. Healthcare
professionals reported the technique as ‘uncomfortable ’to
deliver and felt it was not well received by patients. Patients
reported the technique as ‘unnecessary ’a n dc o n s i d e r e dp o s i t i v e
feedback from healthcare professionals a sufficient reward. The
intervention contains a number of other self-regulatory behav-
iour change techniques; therefore, the balance of motivational
and volitional techniques was maintained
Inclusion of explicit feedback
on outcomes of behaviourSemi-structured interviews with patients Patients requested a formal record of weight, waist
circumference, blood pressure and glycaemic control (HbA1c)
to allow them to monitor their behavioural progress against
their own anthropometric and clinical outcomes. The ‘record of
progress pad ’was subsequently redesigned to allow provision
for this information. Removal of the technique ‘rewards ’and
inclusion of ‘feedback on outcomes of behaviour ’ensured that
the balance of motivational and volitional techniques was
maintained
Redesign of the record of
progress padSemi-structured interviews with
healthcare professionals and patientsHealthcare professionals reported that there was insufficient
space within version 1 of the record of progress pad to
record PA goals and plans. Patients requested provision to
record and monitor outcomes of behaviour. The record of
progress pad was subsequently revised/optimised and
reintroduced
Inclusion of an intervention
component checklistSemi-structured interviews with
healthcare professionalsHealthcare professionals requested a paper-based checklist of
intervention components/techniques available to them via
the Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes intervention.
They reported that this ‘visual aid ’would reduce cognitive
burden, prompt use of specific techniques and thus increase
the likelihood of implementation of intervention
components
Insertion of an online contents
page to direct users to descriptions
of intervention componentsSemi-structured interviews with
healthcare professionalsAn additional page was inserted into the online training
programme to direct healthcare professionals to descriptions
of each intervention component and examples of how each
component could/should be used. The aim was to (1)
increase fidelity of delivery of intervention components
overall and to specifically target those that were frequently
not delivered and (2) to increase quality of delivery
Insertion of additional online content

a larger number of primary care practices and partici-
pants. Several issues emerged that were later targeted by
refinements to the intervention. These included failure to
deliver intervention components when it would have been
appropriate to deliver them (e.g. use of problem-solving
when patients report barriers to undertaking physical ac-
tivity); behaviour change techniques not delivered because
healthcare professionals felt they were not relevant to the
individual patients ’circumstances (e.g. omission of the
behaviour change technique time management when the
patient is retired); and quality of delivery (i.e. not deliver-
ing behaviour change techniques in accordance with their
published definitions and patient needs, preferences and
circumstances). The latter made fidelity of delivery assess-
ment difficult.
The TDF approach has been used to understand patient
and healthcare professional behaviour and intervention im-
plementation challenges in a variety of contexts such as wit-
ness response at acute onset of stroke [56]; implementation
of a complex intervention for acute low back pain manage-
ment in primary care [57]; hand hygiene behaviours [58];
implementation of family intervention recommendations
within the NICE guideline for schizophrenia [59]; and
clinicians ’behaviour about preoperative test ordering for
anaesthesia management [60] and blood transfusion [61].However, despite wide and successful use, there are several
potential limitations of the TDF approach that should be
acknowledged. Firstly, it is a descriptive framework not a
theory; therefore, relationships between domains cannot
be specified. Secondly, the TDF is frequently used in inter-
view studies; however, inter-coder agreement can be low
[62]. This highlights the issue that it can be difficult to rec-
ognise the boundaries between the domains when using
the TDF as a coding framework [62].
Although the systematic intervention development process
presented has several strengths, the limitations should be ac-
knowledged. The early exploratory work was based on a very
select and small sample of healthcare professionals; therefore,
we cannot be certain that the findings were representative.
Behaviour change techniques identified by the systematic re-
view [14] were based on univariate analyses and only 25 out
of 40 were used across the 17 included RCTs. Therefore, it is
yet to be determined whether the behaviour change tech-
niques omitted could have further optimised the interven-
tion. Moreover, specific clusters of BCTs may be or less
effective at different junctures in the intervention process.
Further avenues of research, which could augment the
information content of Movement as Medication, include
the provision of ‘personalised ’information to individuals
with type 2 diabetes on the likely absolute benefits of
Fig. 3 Image of the Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes intervention toolkitAvery et al. Implementation Science  (2016) 11:99 Page 18 of 21
increasing their levels of PA. However, there has been
limited research looking into the impact of numerical and
graphical information on risk in the context of type 2
diabetes. The @Risk trial investigated the utility of theory-
based methods of conveying absolute 10-year risk of car-
diovascular disease to patients with type 2 diabetes [63].
This trial found a positive effect on the accuracy of pa-
tients ’estimates of cardiovascular risk perception (agree-
ment between the patient ’s UK Prospective Diabetes Study
risk engine score for cardiovascular disease and the pa-
tient ’s perceived risk) at 2 weeks, but not 12 weeks, with
no significant impact on attitudes and intentions to make
lifestyle behaviour changes. Further research is warranted
to establish whether evidence-based information that
transparently communicates the absolute risk reduction/
benefit of developing complications and/or progressing to
insulin treatment as a function of incremental changes to
patients ’current levels of PA could further support the for-
mation of positive outcome expectancies (in both patients
and healthcare professionals). In addition, an assessment is
needed as to whether this could serve as a further mechan-
ism for augmenting the BCT ’s‘provide information on the
consequences of behaviour to the individual ’and support-
ing collaborative discussions with healthcare professionals
about self-management strategies for increasing PA in the
p r i m a r yc a r es e t t i n g .
Future research is needed to explore the impact of
providing individualised feedback on performance to
healthcare professionals as part of an enhanced training
programme to establish any additional benefit in terms
of fidelity of delivery and successful implementation of
behavioural interventions in the primary care setting.
The Movement as Medicine Intervention could also be
provided as a compliment to existing programmes such
as DESMOND and X-PERT by providing healthcare
professionals with the skills to provide ongoing support.
With the recent inception of Clinical Commissioning
Groups (CCGs) in the UK, there is arguably a greater need
to demonstrate cost-effectiveness as well as clinical effect-
iveness. The former will need to be a core component of
future randomised studies. This will elucidate any im-
provement in outcomes as a function of cost savings to
the UK National Health Service and as a function of cost
of the intervention per patient against the cost savings of
the reduced diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.
Threats to continued uptake of the intervention over
time should be considered. These include the need for up-
dating the Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes
intervention over time as new evidence emerges on the
effectiveness of behaviour ch ange models/theory, theory-
linked behaviour change techniques and types of PA and
exercise, including sedentar y behaviour [64]. Otherwise,
after a relatively short period of time, the intervention may
be viewed as out of date and that would impact negativelyon uptake rates by healthcare professionals over time (and
ultimately prevent patients from receiving the support they
need to increase their PA behav iour). Furthermore, infor-
mation computer technology is progressing rapidly, and to
maintain uptake rates, there is also need to update and
maintain the online trainin g programme to ensure com-
patibility with primary care systems.
Conclusions
Despite PA being widely considered to be a cornerstone of
diabetes care, rarely are healthcare professionals trained to
provide support to adults with type 2 diabetes to become
more physically active. In accordance with the MRC frame-
work for development and evaluation of complex interven-
tions [18], we have described the systematic development
of a multifaceted PA behavioura l intervention with refer-
ence to the pre-clinical (theoretical), modelling (phase I)
and exploratory trial (phase II) phases. All phases contrib-
uted meaningfully to the inter vention development process.
In particular, the mixed methods open pilot study with as-
sessment of fidelity was most useful for the following
reasons: increased confidence that the intervention could
feasible be delivered as specified, allowed the intervention
to be optimised ahead of a planned pilot RCT and provided
invaluable insights into the imp lementation of the interven-
tion into routine practice. Following optimisation and a
preliminary positive assessment of acceptability, feasibility
and fidelity at 1-month foll ow-up with healthcare profes-
sionals and patients, future research will compare the
Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes multifaceted
PA behavioural intervention to standard clinical care in a
pilot RCT [21].
