Obesity and related chronic illnesses are leading causes of death and excessive health
care costs, necessitating identiﬁcation of factors that can help patients achieve and
maintain healthy weight. Greater self-eﬃcacy and perceived spousal support in
patients have been associated with successful weight management. The current study
also assesses self-eﬃcacy and perceived support in spouses and whether these factors
are related to patient weight. At baseline of a spousal support trial, patients and
spouses ( N¼255 couples) each completed measures of self-eﬃcacy and spousal
support for their own exercise and healthy eating behaviors. We ﬁt a multivariable
regression model to examine the relationship between these factors and patient
weight. Patients were 95% males and 65% Whites, with average age of 61 years
(SD¼12) and weight of 212 lbs ( SD¼42). Spouses were 64% Whites, with average
age of 59 years ( SD¼12). Factors associated with lower patient weight were older
patient age (estimate ¼70.8 lbs, p5.01), normal blood pressure (estimate ¼717.6
lbs,p5.01), higher patient self-eﬃcacy for eating healthy (estimate ¼73.8 lbs,
p¼.02), and spouse greater perceived support for eating healthy (estimate ¼710.0
lbs,p¼.03). Future research should explore the causal pathways between perceived
support and health outcomes to establish whether patient support behaviors could
be a point of intervention for weight management.

Introduction
Obesity is the second leading cause of death in the United States and is associated
with many deadly and costly diseases (Danaei et al., 2009; Flegal, Graubard,
Williamson, & Gail, 2005; Thorpe, Florence, Howard, & Joski, 2004). Weight loss
interventions typically achieve only small, short-term eﬀects, indicating the need to
ﬁnd additional strategies to help patients achieve and maintain a healthy weight

(Goldstein, Whitlock, DePue, & Planning Committee of the Addressing Multiple
Behavioral Risk Factors in Primary Care Project, 2004; Michie, Abraham,
Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009; Rao et al., 2011, WHO, 2009).
Self-eﬃcacy, the belief in one’s capability to perform a given behavior or course
of action, has been consistently related to a wide range of health behaviors, including
better response to weight control interventions (Ashford, Edmunds, & French, 2010;
Linde, Rothman, Baldwin, & Jeﬀery, 2006; Schwarzer & Fuchs, 1996). Support from
spouses is also related to healthier outcomes in patients. Several interventions have
achieved more positive eﬀects, including weight loss, in patients when patients and
spouses were both treated compared to when patients were treated without spouses,
although these eﬀects are generally small and short-lived (Martire, Schulz, Helgeson,
Small, & Saghaﬁ, 2010; McLean, Griﬃn, Toney, & Hardeman, 2003).
Self-eﬃcacy and perceived spousal support have been studied almost exclusively in
patients alone. However, spouses share environments, psychological and relationship
characteristics (Kenny, 1996), and risk factors for health outcomes (Di Castelnuovo,
Quacquaruccio, Donati, de Gaetano, & Iacoviello, 2008), so several unexplored
partner eﬀects between spouses might also be important for healthy weight
management. First, spouses with high self-eﬃcacy for their own healthy behaviors
might positively aﬀect patients’ weight by, for example, modeling healthy behaviors for
patients. Second, spouses’ perceptions of received spousal support might be positively
related to maintaining a healthy weight. Previous studies indicate that spouses’
perceptions of patients’ behavior can be related to patient outcomes; for example,
spouses’ perceived criticism from patients has been related to depressed patients’
symptoms (Peterson & Smith, 2010).
In the current study, we hypothesized that greater patient self-eﬃcacy and
perceived spousal support would be associated with lower patient weight. We also
hypothesized that higher spouse self-eﬃcacy and more spouse perceived spousal
support would be associated with lower patient weight.
Methods and procedures
Participants were veterans and their spouses enrolled in the Couples Partnering for
Lipid-Enhancing Strategies (CouPLES) trial at the Durham VA Medical Center.
Detailed methods have been published previously (Voils et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, 255
married veterans with elevated LDL-C and their spouses were randomized as a pair
to receive a 10-month telephone intervention focused on lowering cholesterol or
usual care. The present analysis used only baseline data.
The outcome variable, patient weight, was obtained from the record of patients’
most recent clinical appointment in relation to the baseline assessment; these
appointments were within a median number of 40 (1st quartile ¼6; 3rd quartile
101) days of the baseline assessment.
Explanatory variables
Self-eﬃcacy and spousal support
To measure self-eﬃcacy for exercise (nine items) and healthy eating (15 items),
patients and spouses each rated their conﬁdence that they could (1) exercise three
times per week for 20 min under certain circumstances (e.g. ‘‘ if the weather were
bad’’) and (2) adhere to a cholesterol-lowering diet under certain circumstances (e.g.2 P. Gallagher et al. 176
‘‘at a restaurant with friends ’’). Response scales were 1 ( not at all conﬁdent )t o1 0
(extremely conﬁdent ). Patient perceived spousal support was measured with patient
ratings of the amount of support they received from their spouses; spouse perceived
spousal support was measured with spouse ratings of the support they receive from
patients. Spousal support scales were adapted from previous scales (Sallis,
Grossman, Pinski, Patterson, & Nader, 1987). Spousal support for exercise was
measured with 15 items (e.g. ‘‘ My spouse helped plan activities around my exercise ’’).
Spousal support for healthy eating was measured with 10 items (e.g. ‘‘ My spouse
refused to eat the same foods I eat ’’). Response scales for both spousal support
questionnaires were 1 ¼never ,2¼rarely ,3¼a few times ,4¼often ,5¼very often .
Scores were the average of the non-missing items after reversing appropriate items;
higher scores indicate greater self-eﬃcacy or spousal support.
Other covariates
Patients provided age and race and indicated whether they had ever been diagnosed
with heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure (yes or no); spouses provided age
and race. Patients and spouses both reported family history of coronary heart disease
(CHD); those who reported that parents or siblings had been diagnosed with CHD
before the age of 55 for male relatives or age 65 for female relatives were coded as
having family history of CHD (vs. no history). Patient and spouse knowledge of
cholesterol facts was assessed with a validated scale (Frank, Winkleby, Fortmann,
Rockhill, & Farquhar, 1992), with higher scores indicating more knowledge.
Analysis
We ﬁrst ﬁt a series of simple (bivariate) linear regression models with patient weight
as the outcome and each of the explanatory variables described above. We then ﬁt a
multivariable linear regression model with patient weight as the outcome and all of
the explanatory variables described above. We examined the correlation matrix of
explanatory variables and checked for multicollinearity among explanatory
variables. There was no evidence of multicollinearity or poor model ﬁt. All analyses
were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Average patient clinical and demographic factors appear in Table 1. On average,
patients were 61 years old and weighed 212 pounds.
Average levels of self-eﬃcacy and spousal support were similar in patients and
spouses, and patient and spouse ratings (see Table 2) were generally moderately
correlated (see Table 2). Within patients, correlations between diet and exercise self-
eﬃcacy, and diet and exercise perceived support were .56 and .45, respectively.
Within spouses, correlations between diet and exercise self-eﬃcacy, and diet and
exercise perceived support were .21 and .53, respectively.
In the simple linear regression models, the following variables were associated
with patient baseline weight: patient self-eﬃcacy for eating healthy and for exercise,
spouse perceived support for eating healthy and exercise, and patient age, blood
pressure status, and race (see Table 3). In the multivariable model, patient self-
eﬃcacy for eating healthy and spouse perceived support for eating healthy werePsychology, Health & Medicine 3177
associated with patient weight. Each one-point increase in patient self-eﬃcacy for
healthy eating corresponded to a mean decrease of 3.8 lbs in baseline weight (95%
CI¼77.0,70.7;p¼.02), and each one-point increase in spouse perceived support
for healthy eating corresponded to a mean decrease of 10.0 lbs in weight (95%
CI¼718.8,71.2;p¼.03). Similar to the simple regression models, older age was
associated with lower weight, and high blood pressure was associated with higher
weight (see Table 3).
Discussion
The current ﬁnding extends past research connecting perceived spousal support to
patients’ health by indicating that the support spouses perceive from patients could
play a role in patients’ own health outcomes. Spouses’ higher ratings of perceived
support could reﬂect patients’ favorable attitudes toward or motivations for healthyTable 1. Patient and spouse clinical and demographic characteristics.

eating. For example, patients who believe in the value of healthy eating might have
lower weight and might be more likely to support healthy eating in their spouses.
Patients’ perceived spousal support for exercise and eating healthy were not
signiﬁcantly associated with weight. Most of the patients in our study were males,
and sex diﬀerences have been reported in the eﬀects of spousal support and in
provision of spousal support (Luszczynska, Boehmer, Knoll, Schulz, & Schwarzer,
2007; Schulz & Schwarzer, 2004; Wallace, Raglin, & Jastremski, 1995), suggesting
that men might perceive or react to social support diﬀerently than women.
Some studies suggest that diet and exercise behaviors share underlying self-
regulatory skills (Annesi, 2011; Mata et al., 2009). Our ﬁndings support this idea in
two ways: First, patient ratings of self-eﬃcacy for diet and for exercise were
correlated, and second, only diet variables remained associated with lower weight in
the multivariable model, suggesting that diet and exercise measures were tapping
into one underlying factor.
One limitation of this study was its observational design, which prevents
conclusions about causal relationships and raises the possibility of unmeasured
confounders. Another limitation is that patients’ weight was obtained from their
medical records, and not at the time of other baseline measures; ideally, these
measurements would be obtained on the same day.
In conclusion, our results support the idea that dynamics of patients’ relationship
with their spouse play a role in their weight management (Di Castelnuovo et al.,
2008; Martire et al., 2010). Future research should explore the causal pathways for
both partner and actor eﬀects between spouses. Interventions might beneﬁt from
targeting spouses’ support of patients, as in past interventions, and from targeting
patients’ support of their spouses’ healthy eating.
