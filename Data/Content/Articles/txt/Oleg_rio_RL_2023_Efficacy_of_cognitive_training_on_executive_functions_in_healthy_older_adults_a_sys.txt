ABSTRACT
Objective:  Systematically review randomized controlled trials on 
the efficacy of cognitive training on executive functions in healthy 
older people.
Measures:  The outcome measures were related to inhibitory con -
trol, working memory, and cognitive flexibility.
Results:  Thirty-one trials were included in the systematic review 
and thirteen trials in the meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, the 
cognitive training enhanced inhibitory control when measured by 
the Stroop task ( p < .001, d = 1.64) and working memory when 
measured by the Corsi Block task ( p = .002, d = .16). A marginal 
significance was found for working memory in the Digit Span task 
– Forward ( p = .06, d = .92). However, cognitive training did not 
enhance inhibitory control when measured by the Go/No-Go task 
(p = .76, d = .59), working memory when measured by the Digit 
Span – Backward ( p = .72, d = .95) and N-Back ( p = .10, d = .26) 
tasks, and cognitive flexibility when measured by Trail Making – 
Part B ( p = .08, d = .27) and Semantic Fluency ( p = .49, d = .06) 
tasks.
Conclusion:  Mixed evidence was found for inhibitory control and 
working memory; cognitive flexibility showed no evidence of 
improvement.
The increase in human longevity, driven by improvements in living conditions, nutri -
tion, medical technology, and cognitive development, has dramatically changed the 
prospects of future life, especially for older adults (Caswell & Zarulli, 2018 ; Maldonado 
Briegas et  al., 2020 ). The increase of longevity must be seen as a modern science 
achievement. The United Nations estimates that the number of older adults (i.e. ≥ 
65 years old) worldwide will rise from 0.7 billion (9%) in 2019 to 1.5 billion (16%) in 
2050 (United Nations, 2019 ). However, a higher proportion of older people are sus -
ceptible to illnesses since the aging process is generally described as being closely 
associated with the onset of many diseases (Lazarus & Harridge, 2018 ). The review

proposed by Jaul and Barron ( 2017 ) summarized the main age-related diseases in 
older adults and highlighted mild short-term memory loss, word-finding difficulty, 
and slower processing speed as normal parts of aging. The neuropsychological liter -
ature indicates that healthy older adults showed worse performance than healthy 
younger adults on a variety of cognitive tasks that assessed: processing speed, inhi -
bition, and visual-spatial ability (Ferguson et  al., 2021 ; Kujawski et  al., 2021 ; Langeard 
et  al., 2021 ; Li et  al., 2021 ). In contrast, the review proposed by Harada et  al. ( 2013 ) 
reported that some crystallized abilities (e.g. vocabulary) show a slower decline due 
to brain aging and may even improve with age because of knowledge accumulated 
during their lives. For instance, older adults show better performance when compared 
to younger adults on tasks in which they use wisdom (e.g. judgment and 
problem-solving tasks; Dumas, 2017 ). Therefore, there is a great and growing effort 
of the neuroscience community on the nature of later life, including how to sustain 
cognitive health and even how to enhance it (Foster & Walker, 2021 ).
Cognitive functions (e.g. perception, attention, memory, problem solving, executive 
functions, decision making, intelligence) play a crucial role in our functioning, impact -
ing our everyday life activities (see Demir Akça et  al., 2014 ; Murman, 2015 ). Some 
functions—especially the executive functions—decline gradually over time as a result 
of the continuous aging process, that is, nonpathological and age-associated cognitive 
decline (Murman, 2015 ). The executive functions are key functions for everyday life, 
allowing individuals to plan ahead, focus their attention, switch between different 
tasks, and maintain effective levels of independent functioning (Corbo & Casagrande, 
2022 ; Ferguson et  al., 2021 ). The literature shows that a good performance in exec -
utive functions is associated with successful goal attainment in a variety of contexts 
(e.g. Pascual et  al., 2019 ; Peng et  al., 2022 ), independence, autonomy, and quality of 
life (Coppin et  al., 2006 ; Gamage et  al., 2018 ), as well as oriented behaviours and 
complex situations, such as crossing the street (Nicholls et  al., 2022 ). Deficits in exec -
utive functions have been associated with poor outcomes, such as poor social function, 
impaired instrumental activities of daily living, and depression (Alexopoulos et  al., 
2000 ; Duggan et  al., 2017 ). Studies conducted with older adults have demonstrated 
declines in executive cognitive functions (e.g. inhibition control, mental shifting; Peng 
et  al., 2022 ) which is gradually mediated by a decrease in brain volume (in the right 
parietal and prefrontal cortices, for instance; Fastame et  al., 2022 ). As a result of aging, 
the executive functions are one of the first cognitive functions to decline due to 
micro and macrostructural alterations in the brain connectivity (for a functional and 
structural perspective, see Fjell et al., 2017 ). The executive functioning is a higher-order 
processing activity in the brain, and it is the process by which individuals exercise 
conscious control over their thoughts and actions (Fan & Wang, 2023 ). Most related 
changes in executive functions are suggestive of impairment in the frontal lobes, and 
changes in the frontostriatal circuit (i.e. neural pathways connecting the frontal lobe 
with the basal ganglia) are possibly the most significant cause of impaired executive 
function in older adults with no dementia (Lima-Silva et  al., 2012 ).
In terms of constituents of executive functioning, one of the most accepted the -
oretical frameworks proposes a core triad of functions: inhibitory control, working 
memory, and cognitive flexibility (see Diamond, 2013 ; Lehto et al., 2003 ; Miyake et al., 
2000 ). Inhibitory control is the cognitive ability to suppress or countermand a thought, 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 3
action, or feeling (Spechler et al., 2016 ). It allows an individual to inhibit their impulses 
and natural, habitual, or dominant behavioural responses to stimuli in order to select 
more appropriate behaviours consistent with one’s goals (Li et  al., 2022 ). Inhibitory 
control can be measured using classical paradigms of experimental psychology, for 
example, the Stroop task, Go/No-Go task, and the Stop-Signal task (Kang et al., 2021 ). 
Working memory is the cognitive ability that allows an individual to hold a small 
amount of information that can be held in mind and applied in the execution of 
cognitive tasks (Cowan, 2014 ). It is essential to all advanced thinking to learn facts 
or skills (Bergman Nutley & Söderqvist, 2017 ). Experimentally, working memory can 
be measured using classical paradigms, for example, the Digit Span task, Letter/
Number Sequencing task, and the Corsi Block task (Shelton et  al., 2009 ). Cognitive 
flexibility is the ability that allows an individual to efficiently adjust one’s behaviour 
according to a changing environment (Dajani & Uddin, 2015 ). It enables individuals 
to integrate external evidence into previous expectancies (Romero-Ferreiro et  al., 
2022 ). Experimentally, cognitive flexibility can be measured using classical paradigms, 
for example, the Trail-Making Task—Part B, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, and Fluency 
tasks (Takeda & Fukuzaki, 2021 ).
The human brain is inherently plastic and is continually adapting to its environment. 
Thus, despite the inevitable aging process, engagement in cognitive activities (e.g. 
learning a new language, maintaining social connections, and engaging in challenging 
cognitive tasks) can potentially mitigate cognitive declines (Stieger & Lachman, 2021 ). 
Importantly, cognitive training of executive functions seems to increase functional 
and neural plasticity, even in older age (Nguyen et  al., 2019 ). Cognitive training is an 
intervention centred on the cognitive performance that uses a set of standardized 
behavioural task protocols that tackle cognitive functions (Golino & Flores-Mendoza, 
2016 ), and that may be associated with other interventions (e.g. physical exercise; 
Anguera et al., 2022 ). These ‘trainable’ functions range from lower level processes—for 
example, perception: biological motion—to higher order processes—for example, 
executive functions: working memory (see Legault & Faubert, 2012 ; Weng et  al., 2019 ). 
The efficacy is usually assessed through cognitive evaluation (e.g. neuropsychological 
testing) for one or several cognitive domains before and after the intervention.
Considering that older adults have a high risk of serious cognitive diseases, iden -
tification of strategies and possible interventions for preventing cognitive decline is 
necessary (Giuli et  al., 2016 ). In recent times, several devices and platforms have 
started to play a significant role in cognitive training since such training can poten -
tially be undertaken at any time and accessed from anywhere (Klimova, 2016 ). Rapid 
advances in computing technology had evolved exponentially over time due to a 
fusion of technologies that are blurring the lines between physical, digital, and bio -
logical spheres (Park, 2016 ). As a result, this has enabled researchers and clinical 
professionals to conduct accessible and fine-tuned cognitive training using virtual 
reality, interactive video game playing, mobile setup, and other cutting-edge tech -
nologies (Ge et  al., 2018 ).
Over the last years, many studies showed positive results of cognitive training on 
cognitive functioning in older adults. A review proposed by Sanjuán et  al. ( 2020 ) 
endorsed the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in older adults. However, the 
authors highlighted aspects that must be met by proper experimental protocols for 
4 R. L. OLEGÁRIO ET AL.
cognitive training (e.g. session length, total number of sessions, measures of daily 
functioning) in order to make the intervention more effective. Additionally, with the 
growing number of publications related to cognitive training applied in clinical pop -
ulations, there has been an increase in the number of systematic reviews with and 
without meta-analysis. A meta-analysis proposed by yun and Ryu ( 2022 ) demonstrated 
cognitive training was the most effective intervention in healthy older adults in com -
parison to cognitive stimulation (e.g. reality orientation) and cognitive rehabilitation 
(e.g. activities to improve the performance of daily activities). Nevertheless, systematic 
reviews show conflicting results (Makin, 2016 ; Traut et  al., 2021 ). Some reviews fond 
clear benefits to a trained ability—for example, executive function in older adults 
with cognitive impairment (see Abd-alrazaq et  al., 2022 ), while other reviews yield 
little to no evidence of benefit from cognitive training (see Sala et  al., 2019 ). In addi -
tion, the reviews usually assess the efficacy of cognitive training on outcomes related 
to global cognition and neglect cognitive subdomains.
Therefore, and because cognitive training deals extensively with several areas (e.g. 
basic science, health, public policies, industry, and marketing), systematic reviews 
must be conducted periodically to present the state-of-the-art of the field and show 
its improvements in terms of methodological control. Four previous studies have 
performed systematic reviews with meta-analysis to address the effect of cognitive 
training on executive function in healthy older adults (Chiu et  al., 2017 ; Lampit et  al., 
2014 ; Nguyen et  al., 2019 ; Wollesen et  al., 2020 ). Considering the high heterogeneity 
of the trials in terms of intervention implemented, type of controls, cognitive processes 
assessed, and response variables, in addition to the increase in published papers, 
professionals and decision makers are seeking reviews with detailed data and higher 
degrees of specificity. The meta-analyses conducted by Lampit et  al. ( 2014 ) and Chiu 
et  al. ( 2017 ) investigated outcomes related to different cognitive functions (memory, 
attention, processing speed, executive function, and visual-spatial skills) in healthy 
older adults. Nguyen et al. ( 2019 ) segmented the meta-analysis by executive functions 
subdomains (inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility), and 
Wollesen et  al. ( 2020 ) split the meta-analysis by type of control (active or passive) in 
the same population. We went further and ran task-specific meta-analyses and pro -
vided meta-analytic data of the neuropsychological tests/paradigms most used in 
cognitive training protocols for older people.
Method
The current study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021237057) and conducted 
in accordance with recommendations outlined by the PRISMA group guidelines (Page 
et  al., 2021 ; see Supplementary Material —Appendix A  for PRISMA-checklist).
Eligibility criteria
We targeted the research question using the PICOS framework: Population—cogni -
tively healthy older adults; Intervention—cognitive training to enhance or maintain 
executive functioning; Comparison—active or passive control groups; Outcome 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 5
–neuropsychological measures of executive functions; Study design—randomized 
controlled trials.
Type of studies
We first identified and then collected peer-reviewed scientific papers of trials from 
online electronic databases written in any language that investigated the effect of 
cognitive training on executive functions outcomes in cognitively healthy older adults.
Type of participants
The total experimental sample of each trial had to comprise individuals aged 59 years 
and older with normal cognitive functioning, and that have not been diagnosed with 
mild cognitive impairment or any form of dementia (experimental and control groups). 
The eligibility was confirmed by examining the baseline characteristics of the sample 
and the trial inclusion criteria.
Type of intervention
The intervention consisted of cognitive training alone or combined with other inter -
ventions (e.g. physical exercise, neuromodulation). We considered cognitive training 
as an approach that involves a set of standardized tasks designed to maintain or 
enhance cognitive processes (Simons et  al., 2016 ). Interventions that significantly differ 
from cognitive training (i.e. not following a series of regular mental activities designed 
to maintain or improve cognitive performance), such as cognitive behavioural therapy 
and mindfulness, were excluded.
Type of outcome measures
The outcome included performance on at least one cognitive test administered both 
before (baseline) and after the cognitive training program. We consider both stan -
dardized instruments and paradigm-based experimental tasks as cognitive tests. 
Performance improvement was expected in executive functions in neuropsychological 
tests when comparing baseline pre-training and immediate post-training. In order to 
employ same-construct comparisons, we categorized the outcome measures by distinct 
executive functions constituents: inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive 
flexibility.
Information source
The following online databases were searched up to April 2021 to identify relevant 
trials: MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science (Science and Social Science Citation 
Index), and SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online). For the identification and use 
of descriptors (i.e. specific keywords), we resorted to medical subject headings (MeSH) 
terms. To include as many trials as possible in addition to the MeSH terms, we included 
additional descriptors with terms not directly linked to MeSH (called ‘Text word’), but 
closely related to the investigated research topic. Subsequently, a new search was 
6 R. L. OLEGÁRIO ET AL.
performed in additional directories up to April 2022 to identify possible updates to 
previously obtained trials: Epistemonikos ( www.epistemonikos.org ), Lens ( www.lens.
org), and Cognitive Training Data ( www.cognitivetrainingdata.org ). To elaborate the 
search strategy in the first two directories, we used the 2D Search open-source soft -
ware ( www.2dsearch.com ), in which queries are formulated by manipulating objects 
on a two-dimensional canvas. In the Cognitive Training Data directory, we extracted 
the trials using Mendeley Reference Manager version 2.63 open-source software ( www.
mendeley.com ). See Supplementary Material —Appendix B  for the detailed search 
strategy for both searches.
Study selection and risk of bias
There were no restrictions on language and publication date. Two authors (RLO and 
SRF) independently removed the duplicate items and performed the initial screening 
(i.e. titles and abstracts reading) of studies identified by the specific search strategy. 
Divergence in study selection was resolved by the third author (RMJ). The two authors 
(RLO and SRF) subsequently read the selected studies’ full text for potentially eligible 
studies. We utilized the Rayyan open-source free web-tool software (rayyan.qcri.org) 
during the entire screening process (on the advantages of Rayyan, see Ouzzani et  al., 
2016 ). The two authors (RLO and SRF) collected data about trial identification (title, 
authors, and year of publication), sample characteristics (sample size, mean age, 
standard deviation of each group), characteristics of the cognitive training, its duration 
(sessions), type of control group involved (active or passive), and the outcome mea -
sures (inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility).
One author (RLO) assessed the methodological quality of the included trials in 
meta-analysis using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB2; for a description, see 
Sterne et  al., 2019 ). This tool provides a framework for assessing the risk of bias in 
a single estimate of an intervention effect reported from a trial. RoB2 is structured 
into seven bias domains (i.e. random sequence generation, allocation concealment, 
blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete 
outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias).
Data extraction and analysis
For the systematic review, the following data were extracted: first author and year, sample, 
mean age, cognitive training type, dose, sessions, length, sessions per week, executive 
function outcomes, and control groups. For the meta-analysis, the continuous data to 
perform the meta-analysis was extracted by one reviewer (RLO) and checked by a second 
reviewer (RMJ). To perform the meta-analysis, we adopted the Review Manager version 
5.4 open-source software (for a description, see Cochrane, 2022 ). The main outcome was 
the standardised mean difference (SMD) from pre- to post-training in the experimental 
group(s) (i.e. cognitive training) and control group(s) (i.e. active or passive).
The analyses on the SMD were conducted for each of the executive function sub -
domains. Precision of the SMD was calculated for each trial by 95% confidence intervals 
(CI). The trials were required to have measured participants baseline ability in the 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 7
trained cognitive skill, and this measure could come from the same task that was 
later used for training or from a different task that assessed the same cognitive skill. 
Furthermore, trials were required to have measured participants cognitive training 
outcomes using gain scores. The continuous data values were entered into a spread -
sheet (available at https://osf.io/64xmj/ ), and then organized to run the meta-analysis.
The selected trials were inserted in a separate spreadsheet tab containing data 
referring to the pre- and post-intervention, including the sample, mean difference, 
and standard deviation of the experimental and control groups. Considering that the 
included trials had distinct populations, intervention parameters, and settings, a ran -
dom effect model was employed in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity was assessed 
by the I2 statistic and 95% CI. The following I2 statistics were considered: 0–40%: not 
important/low heterogeneity; 30%–60%: moderate heterogeneity; 50%–90%: substantial 
heterogeneity; 75%–100%: considerable heterogeneity (Deeks & Higgins, 2022 ). The 
I2 statistic reports the percentage of variation across selected studies that is due to 
heterogeneity among studies (from a statistical origin) rather than chance. The higher 
the I2, the higher the likelihood of drawing incorrect metanalytic inferences on the 
clinical relevance, that is, the effect of the cognitive training (see Melsen et  al., 2014 ). 
As a complementary measure of heterogeneity, we also calculated the Tau-squared, 
which measures variance of the true effect sizes. Assessment of clinical relevance was 
made using three categories: small effect (mean differences [MD] < 10% of the scale; 
standardised mean difference [SMD] < 0.5); medium effect (MD from 10% to 20% of 
the scale; SMD from 0.5 to 0.8); large effect (MD > 20% of the scale; SMD > 0.8) 
(Furlan et  al., 2009 ). In addition, the effect size was assessed by the Cohen’s d. 
Heterogeneity and clinical relevance assessments together allow inferences on the 
intervention efficacy and enable professionals to decide about the applicability of 
the results to their target population. A funnel plot for identifying possible publication 
bias was calculated, and a sensitivity analysis was planned to identify if a specific 
trial changes the overall effect, by repeating the meta-analysis with one trial omitted 
at a time (forest plot inspection for outliers). We adopted a significance level of 5% 
for all tests.
Results
Study selection
The initial search in the electronic databases yielded 3,544 trials. After removal of 
duplicates 2,587 trials were screened. After abstract and title screening, we assessed 
75 full-texts for eligibility. We subsequently included 31 trials in the systematic review 
and 13 trials were selected for meta-analysis. The PRISMA-based flow diagram provides 
an overview of the trials’ selection process ( Figure 1 ).
Characteristics of the included studies
The characteristics of the individual trials are summarized in Table 1 . The publication 
year of the selected trials ranged from 2009 to 2022, and the participants’ age ranged 
between 59 and 82 years old. The included trials had a total of 2,783 participants of

Meta-analyses
Here we present the meta-analyses of each executive function subdomain according 
to a core triad of functions. Only trials that reported pre- and post-intervention data 
were included (i.e. MD and standard deviation). Based on the available data for the 
meta-analysis, we presented the results for the most frequent tasks conducted: Stroop 
and Go/No-Go tasks for inhibitory control; Digit Span (Forward and Backward), N-Back, 
and Corsi Blocks tasks for working memory; and Semantic Fluency and Trail Making—
Part B tasks for cognitive flexibility.2
Effects on inhibitory control
The effects of cognitive training on inhibitory control were evaluated in four trials 
(Kazazi et al., 2021 ; Nouchi et al., 2019 ; Perrot et al., 2019 ; Weicker et al., 2018 ), which 
were measured by the Stroop and Go/No-Go tasks. The meta-analysis on inhibitory 
control measured by the Stroop task resulted in a statistical significance (overall effect) 
in favour of cognitive training intervention when compared to active/passive controls 
(Figure 2  upper half; n = 143 participants, SMD  = .78, CI [.33, 1.22], p < .001, d = 1.64). 
There was low heterogeneity in the overall analysis ( I2 = 35%, Tau2= .05). Additionally, 
the meta-analysis resulted in a statistical significance (subgroup effect) in favour of 
cognitive training when compared to the active control ( n = 120 participants, SMD  = .61, 
CI [.25, .98], p = .001, d = 6.41, I2 = 0%, Tau2= .00) and passive control ( n = 23 partici -
pants, SMD  = 1.53, CI [.58, 2.48], p = .002, d = .41).
The meta-analysis on inhibitory control measured by the Go/No-Go task did not 
show statistical significance (overall effect) in favour of cognitive training intervention 
when compared to active/passive controls ( Figure 2  bottom half; n = 92, SMD  = −0.24, 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 11
CI [–1.79, 1.30], p = .76, d = .59). There was considerable heterogeneity in the overall 
analysis of cognitive training on the Go/No-Go task ( I2 = 92%, Tau2= 1.15). In an overall 
analysis (without comparison of subgroups and tests) the meta-analysis did not show 
statistical significance ( n = 118, SMD  = .42, CI [–0.27, 1.11], p = .76, I2 = 84%, Tau2= .50).
Effects on working memory
The effects of cognitive training on working memory were evaluated in ten trials 
(Ballesteros et  al., 2014 ; Basak et al., 2008 ; Grönholm-Nyman et al., 2017 ; Jaeggi et  al., 
2020 ; Kazazi et al., 2021 ; Lee et al., 2020 ; Nouchi et al., 2019 ; Perrot et al., 2019 , Shatil 
et  al., 2014 ; Weicker et  al., 2018 ), which were measured by the Digit Span (Forward 
and Backward), N-Back, and Corsi Blocks tasks. The meta-analysis on working memory 
measured by the Digit Span Task—Forward showed a marginal statistical significance 
(overall effect) in favour of cognitive training intervention when compared to active/

passive controls (see first forest plot in Figure 3 ; n = 259 participants, SMD  = 2.78, CI 
[–0.07, 5.62], p = .06, d = .92). There was considerable heterogeneity in the overall 
analysis ( I2 = 98%, Tau2= 8.27). The meta-analysis resulted in a statistical significance 
(subgroup effect) in favour of the cognitive training when compared to the passive 
control ( n = 40 participants, SMD  = 2.70, CI [1.82, 3.57], p < .001, d = .09), although 
such output was solely based on one trial; and significance was not achieved when 
cognitive training was compared to active control group ( n = 219  participants, 
SMD  = 2.81, CI [–0.98, 6.61], p = .15, d = .93, I2 = 99%, Tau2= 11.10).
The meta-analysis on working memory by Digit Span—Backward did not show 
significance (overall effect) in favour of cognitive training intervention when compared 
to active/passive controls (see second forest plot in Figure 3 ; n = 292 participants, 
SMD  = .45, CI [–2.05, 2.96], p = .72, d = .95). There was also considerable heterogeneity 
in the overall analysis ( I2 = 98%, Tau2= 7.99). The meta-analysis resulted in a statistical 
significance (subgroup effect) in favour of the passive control when compared to the 
cognitive training ( n = 40 participants, SMD  = − 2.57, CI [–3.43, −1.72], p < .001, d = 
.06), although such output showed a small size effect and was solely based on 
one trial.
The meta-analysis on working memory measured by the Corsi Blocks task showed 
a statistical significance (overall effect) in favour of cognitive training intervention 
when compared to active/passive controls (see third forest plot in Figure 3 ; n = 
133 participants, SMD  = 2.28, CI [.84, 3.73], p = .002, d = .16). There was considerable 
heterogeneity in the overall analysis ( I2 = 90%, Tau2= 1.93). This large heterogeneity 
could be a result of the outcome of the second study of Weicker et  al. ( 2018 ), since 
a reduced heterogeneity ( I2 = 51%, Tau2 = .18) was observed without the data of 
Weicker et  al. ( 2018 ) and the overall effect remained significant. The subgroup effects 
showed near significance and statistical difference in favour of cognitive training when 
compared to active ( n = 80 participants, SMD  = 3.19, CI [–0.42, 6.79], p = .08, d = .57, 
I2 = 96%, Tau2= 6.48) and passive controls ( n = 53 participants, SMD  = 1.49, CI [.22, 
2.76], p = .02, d = .25, I2 = 75%, Tau2= .63), respectively.
The meta-analysis on working memory measured by the N-Back task did not show 
statistical significance (overall effect; see fourth forest plot in Figure 3 ): n = 442 par -
ticipants, SMD  = −1.62, CI [–3.54, .30], p = .10, d = .26). There was considerable hetero -
geneity in the overall analysis ( I2 = 98%; Tau2= 7.38). Interestingly, results showed a 
marginal subgroup effect in favour of the active control when compared to the 
cognitive training ( n = 118 participants, SMD  = −5.47, CI [–10.98, .04], p = .05, d = 1.04, 
I2 = 98%; Tau2= 23.02). In an overall analysis (without comparison of subgroups and 
tests) the meta-analysis did not show statistical significance ( n = 565, SMD  = .49, CI 
[–0.60, 1.57], p = .38, I2 = 98%, Tau2= 6 .18).
Effects on cognitive flexibility
The effects of cognitive training on cognitive flexibility were evaluated in five 
trials (Grönholm-Nyman et  al., 2017 ; Schoene et  al., 2015 ; Shatil et  al., 2014 ; 
Simon et  al., 2018 ; Van Het Reve & De Bruin, 2014 ), which were measured by the 
Trail Making Task—Part B, and Semantic Fluency tasks. The meta-analysis on 
cognitive flexibility measured by the Trail Making Task—Part B did not show

when compared to active/passive controls ( Figure 4  upper half; n = 458 partici -

heterogeneity in the overall analysis ( I2 =91%; Tau2= .52). The meta-analysis 
resulted in a statistical significance (subgroup effect) in favour of the passive 
control when compared to the cognitive training ( n = 81 participants, SMD  = −0.53, 
CI [–0.98, −0.09], p = .02, d = .33), although such output was solely based on one 
trial; and significance was not achieved when active control group was compared

The meta-analysis on cognitive flexibility measured by Semantic Fluency tasks

Methodological quality assessment
The methodological quality was assessed in the thirteen trials included in the 
meta-analysis. The trials of Lee et  al. ( 2020 ), Nouchi et  al. ( 2019 ) and Weicker et  al. 
(2018 ) had the highest score in the seven categories ( Figure 5 ). The categories incom -
plete outcome data  and selective reporting  had a higher percentage of trials with low 
risk of bias ( Figure 6 ).

Discussion
The aim of the present systematic review with meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of 
cognitive training on executive functions in healthy older people. The theoretical framework 
that proposes a core triad of cognitive functions (Diamond, 2013 ; Lehto et  al., 2003 ; Miyake 
et  al., 2000 ) was adopted to segment the meta-analysis in its subdomains (inhibitory 
control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility). We considered different modalities of 
cognitive training (e.g. multidomain/single domain training and combined interventions). 
However, we provided a fine-tuned control over the outcomes and, as far as we know, 
this is the first review with task-specific meta-analytic data targeting executive functions 
in older people. For the investigation of cognitive training efficacy in inhibitory control, 
we adopted the Stroop and Go/No-Go tasks; for working memory, we adopted the Digit 
Span (forward and backward), Corsi Blocks, and N-Back tasks; and for cognitive flexibility, 
we adopted the Trail Making—Part B and Semantic Fluency tasks. Our search obtained 
21 trials that evaluated inhibitory control, 27 trials that evaluated working memory, and 
21 trials that evaluated cognitive flexibility in the systematic review. Most of the selected 
trials also assessed other cognitive functions (e.g. language, processing speed, general 
cognition). Thirteen trials were considered for the meta-analysis, which resulted in mixed 
evidence for the subdomains inhibitory control and working memory, and no evidence 
of improvement for cognitive flexibility.
The evidence regarding the cognitive gains of cognitive training in executive functions 
is also mixed when we consider the first meta-analyses that investigated the main cognitive 
functions in healthy older adults. The review conducted by Lampit et  al. ( 2014 ) selected 
29 randomized controlled trials and found no significant effect for executive functions ( p 
= .96; g = .09). Conversely, Chiu et  al. ( 2017 ) found a small effect size for executive func -
tions ( p < .001; g = .42) in 14 randomized controlled trials. Further reviews then broke 
down executive subdomains in their analyses, and so do we.
Effects on inhibitory control
Our task-specific meta-analysis on inhibitory control measured by the Stroop task 
resulted in a statistical significance ( p < .001; d = 1.64) in favour of cognitive training

when compared to controls. Despite the low quantity, the studies considered for 
analysis on active control showed high methodological quality; and cognitive training 
improved the outcomes on the Stroop task when compared to both passive and 
active controls. In addition, low heterogeneity and high effect size were observed. 
However, cognitive training did not improve the outcomes on the Go/No-Go task. 
This may be related to the duration of the intervention (see Chiu et  al., 2017 ). The 
total number of training hours was 52.9% higher in the studies selected for 
meta-analysis of the Stroop task outcomes compared to the studies selected for the 
Go/No-Go task outcomes. As new studies are carried out, characteristics of cognitive 
training such as training duration should be considered in the future meta-analyses.
Two previous reviews segmented the analysis by executive function subdomains 
(inhibitory control included). Nguyen et al. ( 2019 ) examined the efficacy of single- and 
multidomain cognitive training targeting executive functions in healthy older people. 
The study was not limited to randomized controlled trials and considered 13 studies 
for near-transfer inhibitory control outcomes. The results showed a significant differ -
ence in favour of the cognitive training and a small effect size ( p = .048; g = .13). 
The study by Wollesen et  al. ( 2020 ) investigated the effectiveness of cognitive-motor 
training on executive functions in older people. Eleven randomized controlled trials 
entered the meta-analysis that showed that the intervention enhanced inhibitory 
control ( SMD  = .61; p < .001). Taking all the results together, it is highly plausible to 
assume that inhibitory control can present a mild-to-moderate enhancement by cog -
nitive training in older adults.
Effects on working memory
We also obtained mixed results on working memory outcomes. The meta-analysis on 
working memory measured by the Digit Span task—Forward showed a marginal 
statistical significance in favour of the cognitive training when compared to controls 
(p = .06, d = .92), and no difference was observed in the Digit Span task—Backwards 
(p = .72, d = .95), and in the N-Back task ( p = .10, d = .26). It is likely that more com -
plex tasks (i.e. Digit Span—Backwards and N-Back) would require more training for 
any cognitive improvement than simpler tasks (i.e. Digit Span—Forward). Thus, likewise 
for inhibitory control, the duration of the training may play a role in cognitive gains. 
The near-transfer observed in the Corsi Blocks task in the present work ( p = .002, d = 
.16) may be seen as an argument for the training duration influence. The total number 
of training hours was 21.3% higher in the studies selected for meta-analysis of Corsi 
Blocks task outcomes (significant in favour of the cognitive training) compared to the 
studies selected for Digit Span—Backward and N-Back task outcomes (non-significant 
results). In addition, classic designs of Digit Span tasks require free recall of numbers, 
while classic designs of Corsi Blocks tasks require recognition of spatial locations 
visually available. Therefore, Corsi Blocks is generally an easier task than Digit Span.
Another route of explanation is related to the nature of the task: verbal vs. spatial. 
Our results showed an improvement in working memory due to cognitive training in 
a spatial task (i.e. Corsi Blocks) but not in verbal tasks (i.e. Digit Span—Backward and 
N-Back3). Most influential models of working memory support distinct visuospatial 
and verbal subsystems (Baddeley, 1986 ; Luck & Vogel, 1997 ; Smith et  al., 1996 ) which 
18 R. L. OLEGÁRIO ET AL.
are linked to functional disparities. For instance, participants are usually worse in the 
backward than forward version of the Digit Span, but they have similar performance 
in backward and forward versions of the Corsi Blocks (Donolato et  al., 2017 ). The 
distinction between the two subsystems was also observed in its neural basis since 
visuospatial and verbal working memory activate different brain areas (Chein et  al., 
2011 ; Nagel et  al., 2013 ). Considering the literature and our results, it is reasonable 
to presume that one working memory subsystem may be more prone to enhancement 
from cognitive training than the other.
Previous reviews also investigated the effect of cognitive training on working 
memory in healthy older adults. Wollesen et  al. ( 2020 ) entered five randomized 
controlled trials in the meta-analysis, and there was no effect on working memory 
(p = .19). Three other reviews (Chiu et  al., 2017 ; Lampit et  al., 2014 ; Nguyen et  al., 
2019 ) showed significant differences favouring the cognitive training over controls 
but with small effect sizes (20–45 studies entered the meta-analyses; all p < .001 
and .22 < g < .35). The meta-analysis of Chiu et  al. ( 2017 ) considered overall 
memory outcomes, including short-term memory and working memory; and the 
meta-analysis of Nguyen et al. ( 2019 ) considered short-term memory and working 
memory. The high heterogeneity observed in the Digit Span and N-Back 
meta-analysis ( I2 = 98%) hamper the conclusions. Nevertheless, considering our 
results and previous reviews in older adults, it is plausible to assume that cog -
nitive training causes a near-transfer for some tasks that may present a none-to-
mild enhancement in working memory.
Effects on cognitive flexibility
Both the meta-analysis on cognitive flexibility measured by the Trail Making task—Part 
B and Semantic Fluency tasks did not show statistical significance in favour of cog -
nitive training intervention when compared to controls ( p > .08; d < .11). Wollesen 
et  al. ( 2020 ) entered five randomized controlled trials in the meta-analysis, and also 
found no effect on cognitive flexibility ( p = .09). Nguyen et  al. ( 2019 ) considered 13 
studies, and the analysis revealed a significant difference in favour of the cognitive 
training and a small effect size for the cognitive flexibility outcomes ( p = .031; g = 0.16). 
The few studies altogether support the idea that cognitive flexibility can present a 
none-to-mild enhancement by cognitive training in older adults.
Clinical considerations
In the very best scenario considering the current knowledge, cognitive training is 
likely to provide up to moderate enhancement of executive functions in healthy older 
adults. Thus, health professionals should whenever possible keep recommending other 
interventions that have been proven to maintain or boost general cognition and 
executive functions: physical activity, healthy diet, social and meaningful connections, 
and daily-life complex cognitive tasks (Dominguez et  al., 2021 ; Kelly et  al., 2017 ; 
Newson & Kemps, 2006 ). Nevertheless, despite the modest results, the area must 
maintain efforts to investigate a low-cost non-invasive and highly flexible behavioural 
PSy CHOLOGy & HEALTH 19
intervention. Possibly, the plurality of interventions and outcomes seen in cognitive 
training may produce a fog in the literature of this very recent area.
Although our review summarized studies were carried out in healthy older 
adults, it may also have implications for clinical populations. For instance, exec -
utive dysfunction can be present in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. The 
most frequent neuropsychological alterations range from mild executive dysfunc -
tion in the early stages to mild cognitive impairment, and then dementia in the 
later stages (Dirnberger & Jahanshahi, 2013 ). Thus, the implementation of cognitive 
training focusing on executive functions can be adopted as a complementary 
treatment in an attempt to delay neuropsychological impairments. Similarly, 
people living with HIV experience cognitive decline, including in executive func -
tions (Kanmogne et  al., 2018 ). Previous research has shown that cognitive training 
is associated with improvements in cognitive and daily function among this 
population, and has suggested that better results occur after longer cognitive 
training sessions (Wei et  al., 2022 ). Finally, when dealing with older adults, it is 
necessary to consider the limitations of these individuals when it comes to 
mobility and sensorial loss, in addition to age-adjusted task complexity and 
cognitive load.
Highlights, limitations, and future directions
This study is the first review with task-specific meta-analytic data targeting executive 
functions in older people. We believe that a fine-tuned control over the outcomes 
provides better clarity regarding the efficacy of cognitive training interventions, and 
hence helps professionals and decision makers who seek for reviews with detailed 
data and higher degrees of specificity. Given that the world’s population is aging 
faster than ever before and that innovative approaches to improving the quality of 
life of older people have been investigated in the literature, this study provides an 
overview of prospective experimental design data (e.g. dose, sessions, length, tests) 
for the implementation of cognitive training programmes targeting executive functions 
in healthy older adults, as well as the subdomains of executive functions with greater 
and less effectiveness, according to the literature. In addition, for the present review 
we conducted the search in databases and directories not considered in previous 
reviews with meta-analysis that investigated the effect of cognitive training on exec -
utive functions in older adults (Chiu et  al., 2017 ; Lampit et  al. 2014 ; Nguyen et  al., 
2019 ; Wollesen et al., 2020 ); they were: Scielo, Web of Science, Lens.org, epistemonikos.
org, and cognitivetrainingdata.org.
Since we had tight control over the cognitive training outcomes in the pre- and 
post-testing, we ran meta-analyses with few studies. Our study also presents a lim -
itation regarding the types of the selected trials. We have not restricted combined 
trials (i.e. cognitive training plus a second intervention), and we made no distinction 
regarding the type of training sessions (simultaneous or sequential training), the 
duration of the sections, and the cognitive function trained (single-domain or multi -
domain training). In addition, the present review only compared data of pre- and 
post-training. Future investigations may tackle long-term efficacy of task-specific gains 
in executive function in older people.

Hopefully, as new trials are published and accumulate, it would be optimal to 
obtain task-specific meta-analytic data segmented by efficacy duration (immediate 
and long-term), type of transfer (i.e. near and far), and type of outcome. In par -
ticular, it would be of great interest to obtain results on ecologically-validated 
outcomes due to the close relation of executive functions and functional everyday 
life activities.
Conclusion
The present review on the effect of cognitive training for healthy older adults showed 
mixed evidence for inhibitory control and working memory enhancement, and no 
evidence of improvement for cognitive flexibility.
Notes
 1. A passive control group refers to protocol with no intervention between pre- and 
post-testing (i.e. no-contact control group). An active control group refers to protocol 
with an intervention, ideally with similar topography of the experimental group’s inter -
vention, but planned to promote no enhancement in the cognitive processes of interest 
that is evaluated in the pre- and post-testing (e.g. playing Sudoku when the experimen -
tal intervention seeks to promote gains in inhibitory control) in order to control 
placebo-like effects of the cognitive training.
 2. The Stroop task assesses the ability to inhibit cognitive interference, which occurs 
when the processing of a stimulus feature simultaneously affects the processing of 
another attribute of the same stimulus (Scarpina & Tagini, 2017 ). The Go/No-Go task 
involves a series of decisions in which participants are asked to respond to one 
class of stimuli, that is, the go stimuli, but not to another class of stimuli, that is, 
the no-go stimuli ( young et  al., 2018 ). The Digit Span task involves reading out a 
series of strings of digits to the participants who are required to repeat them in 
the same or reverse order of presentation (i.e. forward and backward conditions; 
Tripathi et  al., 2019 ). In the N-Back task participants are presented a series of visu -
al stimuli and they are asked for each stimulus whether it matches a stimulus n 
positions before, which requires maintaining continuous updating and processing 
of information (Gajewski et  al., 2018 ). The Corsi Block consists of a surface of scat -
tered blocks in which the examiner taps a sequence of blocks and the participant 
has to repeat the sequence in the same order or backwards (Kessels et  al., 2000 ). 
In the Trail Making – Part B, subjects connect 25 encircled numbers and letters in 
numerical and alphabetical order, alternating between numbers and letters (Linari 
et  al., 2022 ). In the Semantic Fluency tasks the individuals are required to recall 
items. Some variations of this test include the fluency of certain classes of words 
or different semantic categories such as animals and fruits (Lopes et  al., 2009 ).
 3. From the total of 5 trials that entered the N-Back task meta-analysis, two used pictorial 
stimuli instead of verbal stimuli (Jaeggi et  al., 2020 ; Kazazi et  al., 2021 ). Both trials com -
pared the cognitive training to passive controls and account for a small treatment effect 
(SMD  = .32).
