The use of systematic dose-finding designs to develop behavioral health interventions is lacking. In
contrast, drug development research consistently follows a prescribed, regulated, and iterative pathway
that begins with empirically establishing optimal drug dose. Adapting dose-finding methodologies from
the drug development literature offers several advantages to increasing the feasibility, efficiency, and
rigor of this important intervention refining step for behavioral intervention development. This article
discusses the current state of the science for dose finding within the behavioral intervention development
literature. A detailed overview of one drug development dose-finding methodology (the Accelerated
Biased Coin Up-and-Down design) is then presented, using our work to adapt the Prevention Plus
Intervention for treatment of pediatric obesity for mHealth delivery as an example of how this design can
be applied to empirically derive the dose for a behavioral intervention.

Empirically deriving dose is an important yet rarely completed
step to maximizing the effectiveness of behavioral health interven-
tions and their implementation and dissemination potential. New
models for translational research, like the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) ORBIT model, specify that dose-finding studies
should be included as part of early phase behavioral intervention
development to ensure that all components of interventions sub-
jected to efficacy testing are optimized ( Czajkowski et al., 2015 ).
In the absence of this refining step, a potentially efficacious
intervention may be categorized as ineffective and abandoned
when in fact a slightly higher dose may have led to very differentresults ( Kalichman, 2019 ). Alternatively, an efficacious interven-
tion may not be implemented in real-world settings because it is
deemed too expensive, when perhaps a smaller dose would have
achieved the same health outcome. Finally, suboptimal dosing may
also result in high rates of attrition and therapist burnout ( Kalich-
man, 2019 ;Voils et al., 2012 ,2014 ).
Instead of conducting empirical investigations, behavioral inter-
vention dosing is typically derived from precedent, anecdotal
evidence, clinical experience, and/or asking the targeted popula-
tion about dosing preferences ( Kalichman, 2019 ;Voils et al., 2012 ,
2014 ). Each of these approaches has significant limitations. Insuf-
ficient attention to dose has substantial negative effects on at-
tempts to evaluate the literature in a given area. Systematic reviews
often include only a small fraction of extant intervention trials
because dosing information is not reported ( Kalichman, 2019 ). For
example, in their systematic review and metaregression of behav-
ioral prevention and intervention programs for pediatric obesity,
Heerman and colleagues (2017) excluded 25% of identified RCTs
because publications did not include sufficient information to
determine dose. Further, this metaregression only included in-
tended dose because the majority of trials reviewed did not report
actual (received) dose. Dose derived from anecdotal evidence may
have limited generalizability (e.g., population, provider, or setting-
specific). Finally, while asking a targeted population about dosing
preferences is important to developing human-centered interven-
tions, individual responses may not be consistent, optimal in terms
of efficacy, or cost-effective. Another challenge to empirically
establishing dose of behavioral interventions is the absence of
systematic and efficient dose-finding methodologies. Instead, mul-
tiple and iterative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often
necessary because design and power limitations restrict the num-X

ber of dosing levels that can be evaluated within a single study
(Voils et al., 2014 ). This increases the already lengthy timeline
from intervention development to effectiveness and implementa-
tion trials.
In contrast, traditional drug development follows a pre-
scribed, regulated, and iterative pathway. Efficacy trials (Phase
III) do not occur until a recommended drug dose is empirically
identified (Phase I) and its impact on the desired health outcome
is empirically established (Phase II; Voils et al., 2012 ,2014 ).
Phase I studies aim to identify either (a) the maximally tolerated
dose (MTD) or the largest dose of drug that can be administered
that minimizes the toxicity rate of the medication to only a
small, predetermined proportion of the targeted population
(e.g., chemotherapy yielding negative or adverse health out-
comes to only 5% of the population) or (b) the minimally
effective dose (MED) or the smallest dose of the medication that
yields the desired health outcome in a large, prespecified pro-
portion of the targeted population (e.g., pain medication pro-
viding pain relief in 90% of the population; Pace & Stylianou,
2007 ). Testing is completed via application of established and
efficient dose-finding methodologies. Characteristics of these
designs address many of the challenges faced by behavioral
scientists and their use could thus improve the rigor of early
phase behavioral intervention research.
While there are many pharmaceutical dose-finding designs,
this article focuses on the Accelerated Biased Coin Up-and-
Down Design (ABCD; Stylianou & Follmann, 2004 ). ABCD is
a frequentist method and type of “up-and down” dose-finding
design that aims to achieve balance between tolerability (de-
fined by toxicity or nonresponse or failure) and dose response
(defined by the desired outcome of interest or success). Under
the assumption of monotonic relationship between drug inten-
sity and toxicity, participants are allocated to a higher or lower
drug dose based upon treatment outcome from the previous
participant. Intervention dose is thus identified in a systematic
and empirical fashion. ABCD is based upon the Biased Coin
Up-and Down method, which has better operating characteris-
tics than other up-and-down designs ( Pace & Stylianou, 2007 ;
Stylianou & Flournoy, 2002 ;Stylianou, Proschan, & Flournoy,
2003 ). ABCD’s primary modification to the Biased Coin Up-
and Down method is that ABCD allows multiple participants to
be enrolled at a given time whereas BCD permits only one
participant at a time. The advantages of ABCD to behavioral
intervention development are its simplicity to implement com-
pared to other dose-finding designs (e.g., Continual Reassess-
ment Method, see Voils et al., 2012 ,2014 ), its adaptive ap-
proach that includes randomization, the fact that it requires a
relatively small sample (20–40), and its ability to evaluate
multiple dosing levels in the same study.
Adapting ABCD for Use in Behavioral Intervention
Development Research
In the sections to follow, we describe the ABCD methodology
and use our ongoing work to adapt the Stage I pediatric obesity
treatment (the Prevention Plus Intervention [PPI]) for mHealth
delivery to illustrate how this method could be applied to empir-
ically derive dose for a behavioral health intervention.Adapting Stage I Pediatric Obesity Treatment for
mHealth Delivery
The Expert Committee for Prevention, Assessment, and Treat-
ment of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity recom-
mends a stepped approach to treating pediatric obesity ( Barlow,
2007 ). As a Stage I intervention, the PPI is intended for delivery to
every child who meets criteria for overweight and obesity and by
every provider (e.g., pediatricians, nurse practitioners). High scal-
ability, wide reach, and achieving small but significant changes for
as many children as possible are aims for population-level inter-
ventions such as PPI. When delivering PPI, it is recommended that
providers use Motivational Interviewing (MI; Miller & Rollnick,
2012 ) to collaboratively set goals with families to modify behav-
iors that may increase a preschooler’s obesity risk (e.g., increase
fruit and vegetable intake and decrease screen use). Intervention is
stepped up (Stage II: Structured Weight Management) if “im-
proved BMI status” is not evident after 3–6 months. Multiple
barriers to PPI implementation have been documented. Chief
among these are lack of training for providers in MI or pediatric
weight management and insufficient time to integrate PPI into
already brief well-child visits (e.g., He, Piche, Clarson, Callaghan,
& Harris, 2010 ;Perrin, Flower, Garrett, & Ammerman, 2005 ;
Spivack, Swietlik, Alessandrini, & Faith, 2010 ).
Currently, we are developing an mHealth Prevention Plus In-
tervention for Preschoolers (mPPI-P) with two technology-
delivered components: (a) two brief, motivational sessions sepa-
rated by (b) 1 month of automated, MI-tailored text messages.
While text messaging is the most common type of mHealth inter-
vention component in the obesity treatment literature ( Siopis,
Chey, & Allman-Farinelli, 2015 ;Thomas & Bond, 2014 ), no study
has empirically evaluated what dose (frequency) leads to effective
weight control. Further, in contrast to many published mHealth
interventions for obesity, the text-message component of
mPPI-P is an intervention and all exchanges are two-way.
Text-messaging is thus an ideal candidate for a dose-finding
study. While we focus on one dimension of dose (frequency),
researchers might also select designs to evaluate duration (total
length of the intervention) or amount (length of each interven-
tion contact; Voils et al., 2012 ).
Selecting MED Versus MTD
An important first step in applying ABCD is to determine
whether the design will focus on identifying the MED or MTD.
The MED may seem a more intuitive selection for behavioral
intervention development research because this design aims to
identify the smallest dose that achieves a particular health outcome
response. To apply ABCD to identify the MTD, it is first necessary
to define what it means for a behavioral intervention to be toxic. A
strict translation from drug development cannot be made because
behavioral interventions do not yield physiological toxicity as a
medication might ( Voils et al., 2014 ). However, adverse or nega-
tive outcomes that could occur when dose of a behavioral inter-
vention is too high include “psychosocial toxicity” (e.g., therapist
burnout or patient dependency; Kalichman, 2019 ), excessive costs
associated with treatment delivery, and attrition.
In our applied example, we set our ABCD to focus on
identifying the MTD of text messages that can be administeredThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

over 1 month and define toxicity as attrition. Our choice of an
MTD instead of MED study is because while dose is a sug-
gested moderator of pediatric weight outcomes ( Janicke et al.,
2014 ), attrition from pediatric obesity interventions is high
(Dhaliwal et al., 2014 ). Further, while one of the benefits of text
messaging is the opportunity for real-time intervention, there is
insufficient evidence in the behavioral intervention develop-
ment literature to conclude what frequency of text messaging
(and particularly two-way messaging) individuals will tolerate
before it becomes overly burdensome. Given our choice of an
MTD study, all subsequent sections we describe design proce-
dures in terms of this type of ABCD design. Readers are
referred to Stylianou and Follmann (2004) for more details on
designing an ABCD study to identify the MED.
Determining Dosing Levels
As noted above, ABCD evaluates multiple dosing levels in the
same study. To the extent possible, dosing levels should be derived
from a combination of the strategies commonly used in the behav-
ioral intervention development literature: systematic review of the
literature, identifying preferences of the targeted population,
and/or anecdotal or clinical experience. From these efforts, re-
searchers need to decide what is the hypothesized target dose. For
studies that aim to identify the MTD, the targeted dose is the dose
that will produce toxicity or an undesired outcome in a small
predetermined percentage of the population. While there is no
maximum to the number of doses that can be included in the
design, researchers are encouraged to include a minimum of two
doses above and below the hypothesized target dose ( Liu, Cai, &
Ning, 2013 ).
For mPPI-P, we reviewed the obesity treatment outcome liter-
ature, considered the text message dose within an intervention
using the same motivational interviewing technology platform as
mPPI-P all yielded improvements in motivation, controller medi-
cation use, and lung functioning ( Kolmodin MacDonell, Naar,
Gibson-Scipio, Lam, & Secord, 2016 ;MacDonell, Gibson-Scipio,
Lam, Naar-King, & Chen, 2012 ), and our formative work with
caregivers of young children who exceeded the PPI recommenda-
tion for sugar-sweetened beverages. A review of the adult and
pediatric obesity treatment outcome literatures revealed a wide
range of text messaging doses ranging from once per week up to
four times per day ( Militello, Melnyk, Hekler, Small, & Jacobson,
2016 ;Nezami, Ward, Lytle, Ennett, & Tate, 2018 ;Price et al.,
2015 ;Siopis et al., 2015 ). The only intervention using the same
technology platform to include text messaging found young adults
were highly satisfied with receiving messages daily for 30 days
between motivational sessions and that this treatment package
overall yielded improvements in motivation, medication adher-
ence, and lung functioning ( Kolmodin MacDonell et al., 2016 ;
MacDonell et al., 2012 ). Finally, our formative work revealed
most caregivers of the targeted population also preferred daily
text messaging. As such, in our example, we identified daily
text-messaging as our target dose and set the ABCD to evaluate
seven dose (frequency) levels: (a) once weekly, (b) twice weekly,
(c) every other day, (d) daily, (e) twice per day, (f) three times per
day, and (g) four times per day.Defining /H9003
Prior to initiating the dose-finding study, researchers must de-
fine/H9003, which in an MTD study is the targeted toxicity level or the
proportion of the targeted population expected to experience tox-
icity. In an MTD study, /H9003must be /H110210.50 ( Stylianou & Follmann,
2004 ). For our example with mPPI-P, we want to identify the
MTD of text messaging over 1 month that results in minimal
intervention attrition (e.g., 20%), and thus we set /H9003/H11005 0.2.
Determining Sample Size
Extensive simulations considering a large variety of dose–
response curves were conducted during development of the ABCD
design. These simulations concluded that a sample size of 20–40
is adequate to obtain an estimate of the target dose that is within
one dose level of the true dose ( Stylianou et al., 2003 ). Additional
information about sample size considerations can be found in the
Appendix in the online supplemental materials and in Stylianou
and Follmann (2004) . There are no formal rules for determining
what number in this range is appropriate. Rather, factors such as
length of the intervention being tested, timeline, and project budget
will have a stronger impact on sample size decisions.
Dosing Procedures
ABCD uses a two-step approach to promote faster arrival at the
MTD (see Figure 1 ). Step 1 begins with the first participant
allocated to the hypothesized target dose or dose expected to yield
toxicity. If the participant has a nontoxic response, then Step 1
continues with the next participant allocated to the next highest
dose. This pattern of one participant in active intervention at a time
and each subsequent participant being allocated to the next higher
dose repeats until a participant meets criteria for “toxicity,” at
which time the study moves to Step 2.
Figure 2 presents a hypothetical example of dosing flow for the
first seven families to participate in the dose-finding study. In Step
1, the first family (Family A) is allocated to the hypothesized target
dose of daily text messaging and meets the criterion for a nontoxic
response (retention) on Day 30 because the family has replied to
all messages in the allocated dose. Since Family A did not expe-
rience toxicity, the study remains in Step 1. On Day 32 Family B
is allocated to the next highest dose of text messages (twice daily).
On Day 40, Family B did not respond to a text message, so they are
considered to have a toxic response and the study moves to Step 2.
Per ABCD methodology, the first participant in Step 2 is allo-
cated to the next lower dose than the dose that yielded a toxic
response in Step 1. Dosing procedures depend upon three factors:
(a)/H9003or the desired target toxicity level for the intervention, (b)
dose response of the previous participant, and (c) biased coin flip
based upon a predefined probability of success ( Stylianou &
Follmann, 2004 ). As noted in Figure 1 , if the previous participant
meets the criterion for toxicity, then the next participant is allo-
cated to the next lower dose. If the previous participant meets the
criterion for nontoxicity, then the next participant is randomized
based upon probability b/H11005/H9003/1/H11002/H9003to the next higher dose and
with probability 1 /H11002bto the same dose. In Step 2, a response is
counted as complete either once a participant reaches the end of his
or her evaluation period (the length of the intervention) or as soonThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

as the criterion for toxicity is met. As such, dose allocation for
newly enrolled participants may not be (and usually is not) based
upon the last participant to enroll in the study. In efforts to
minimize bias that might occur from a burst in recruitment and to
ensure the sample is not exhausted on any one dose, ABCD also
limits the number of participants that can be enrolled at a particular
dose at the same time to three ( Stylianou & Follmann, 2004 ).
In continuing with our applied example (see Figure 2 ), Step 2
begins by allocating the next family (Family C) to a dose of daily
text messaging because this dose is the next lower dose that
achieved toxicity in Step 1. Family D begins on Day 50 and, since
Family C has not met the criterion for toxicity or nontoxicity, is
also allocated to the dose of daily text messaging. Family E begins
on Day 52 and, since neither Family C nor Family D has met
criterion for toxicity, they are also allocated to the dose of daily
text messaging. Family F arrives on Day 53 but, because we have
three families at the dose of daily text messaging already, we must
wait to start Family F until one of the families currently amid the
intervention (C, D, or E) meets criterion for toxicity (attrition) or
nontoxicity (retention). This occurs on Day 60, when Family Dfails to respond to a text message and thus meets criterion for
toxicity (attrition). Family F begins the intervention the next day
and because Family D had a toxic response (attrition) is allocated
to the next lower dose (every other day text messaging). Family G
enrolls on Day 72 and because the last family to complete (Family
C on Day 71) had a nontoxic response, is allocated at a probability
ofb/H110050.2/(1–0.2) /H110050.25 to the next higher dose and 1–0.25 /H11005
0.75 to the same dose. In our example, the outcome of the ran-
domization is that Family G receives the same dose (daily text
messaging). The study would continue in this manner until the
desired sample size ( n/H1100520–40) is achieved.
Stopping Rules
If the target dose is not within the levels being tested, then
participants will keep being allocated to the lowest dose (if the
target dose is actually lower than the minimum dose included in
the design) or the highest dose (if the target dose is actually higher
than the maximum dose included in the design). If allocation to the
minimum or maximum dose occurs for more than three to four

consecutive participants, then it is reasonable to stop the study,
reassess the specified dose range, and initiate a new study with a
different dosing range informed by the previous study.
Determining the MTD
The estimation of the recommended dose is determined by
assuming the probability of toxicity increases with increasing dose.
Isotonic regression using a pooled adjacent violators algorithm
(PAVA; Robertson, Wright, & Dykstra, 1998 ) is a natural way to
estimate the probability of toxicity for each dose level tested.
Isotonic estimates of the probability of toxicity are used to produce
an estimator of the target dose. An R code is available to produce
these estimates along with the confidence intervals (contact author
MS).
Conclusions
Despite its importance to treatment optimization and improving
the translational process ( Czajkowski et al., 2015 ), most early
phase work to develop behavioral interventions does not include
studies to empirically determine dose. Identification of systematic
and efficient dose-finding designs may help to address this gap.
Methodologies from drug development, such as ABCD, can be
adapted for use by behavioral researchers and provide several
advantages to increasing the feasibility and rigor of dose finding in
early phase intervention development research including that many
are adaptive, include randomization, and require a range of doses
be tested. Designs are also implemented with small samples with-
out compromising power, making them ideal for grant mechanisms
specific to early phase research (e.g., NIH R21 and R03) that often
have shorter timelines and smaller budgets.
As with any intervention development, consideration must be
given to variables that may impact dosing. Examples include
sociodemographic characteristics, time since diagnosis and disease
severity, neurocognitive and emotional states, content, and also
context if the intervention includes text messaging like the exam-
ple presented in this article. Some variables might be addressed in
work that informs the dose-finding design and others at a later
point in the developmental trajectory when sample sizes are larger
and there is sufficient power to explore mediation and moderation.
Drug development dose-finding methodologies may not be suit-
able for all behavioral interventions, however. For example, de-
fining response for a study that aims to identify the minimally
effective dose of a behavioral intervention is more intuitive as the
majority of behavioral interventions target specific behaviors or
health outcomes (e.g., weight loss or adherence). However, defin-
ingtoxicity is more difficult. Kalichman (2019) suggests the term
psychosocial toxicity to describe unintended outcomes of behav-
ioral interventions like therapist dependency and exhausting emo-
tions. Additional toxic outcomes might include attrition and ther-
apist burnout. Whether and how to explore toxicity of behavioral
interventions warrants additional thought and exploration. Another
consideration is that drug development dose-finding designs are
intended to evaluate interventions and treatments delivered at the
individual level, so they may not be appropriate for behavioral
interventions delivered at the group level.
In summary, empirically deriving dose is imperative to optimiz-
ing behavioral health interventions. However, systematic designsfor completing this step in the behavioral literature are lacking.
The drug development literature offers several designs that can be
adapted for use in behavioral intervention development to address
this critical gap.
