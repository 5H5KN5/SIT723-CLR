Abstract 
Background Despite effective treatments, one fifth of patients develop chronic depression. Music therapy may offer 
a different approach. This study aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability of a music therapy intervention and trial 
methodology.
Methods A parallel two-arm randomised controlled trial with wait-list control, mixed feasibility/acceptability meas-
ures and nested process evaluation. Adults with long-term depression (symptom duration > 1 year) were recruited 
from community mental health services and computer randomised to 42 sessions of group music therapy with 
songwriting three times per week or wait-list control. Depression, social functioning, distress, quality of life, satisfac-
tion and service use were assessed by blinded researchers at enrolment, 1 week and 3 and 6 months post-therapy. 
Outcomes were analysed descriptively, controlling for baseline covariates. Recruitment (number eligible, participation 
and retention rates) and intervention (fidelity, adherence) feasibility were assessed using pre-defined stop–go criteria. 
Attendance, adverse events, mood, relationship satisfaction and semi-structured interviews were analysed in a nested 
process evaluation.
Results Recruitment processes were feasible with 421 eligible, 12.7% participation and 60% (18/30) retention. Thirty 
participants were randomised to intervention (N = 20) and control (N = 10). Session attendance was low (mean 10.5) 
with four withdrawals. Music therapist adherence was good but changes to session frequency were suggested. 
Outcomes were available for 10/20 treatment and 9/10 wait-list participants. Depression increased in both arms 
post-therapy. Treatment depression scores fell below baseline 3 and 6 months post-therapy indicating improvement.

Wait-list depression scores increased from baseline 3 and 6 months post-therapy. At 3 months, the treatment arm 
improved from baseline on all measures except satisfaction and functioning. At 6 months, quality of life, distress and 
functioning improved with reduction in health service contacts. High-attending participants improved more than 
low-attending. Seven adverse events (one serious) were reported.
Limitations As this was a feasibility study, clinical outcomes should be interpreted cautiously.
Conclusion A randomised controlled trial of group music therapy using songwriting is feasible with inclusion criteria 
and session frequency modifications, but further intervention development is required.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibil -
ity?
Music therapy is a promising intervention for 
depression but has not been tested in a group song -
writing format for long-term depression. We were also 
uncertain about the numbers that would meet our def -
inition of long-term depression and how best to iden -
tify and recruit them to our study.
• What are the key feasibility findings?
The study methods were feasible and acceptable 
to participants and we were able to recruit suffi -
cient numbers within the timeframe required. Group 
attendance was low, with a high proportion not attend -
ing a single session, and initial high attrition. Inclu -
sion criteria may require a more stringent assessment 
of depression severity and this may aid identification 
of participants more likely to attend the interven -
tion. Outcomes suggested a worsening of symptoms 
post-intervention in both arms before improvements 
3  months later. The intervention requires further 
modification in terms of frequency, location, music 
therapist technological support and support for group 
members once the groups come to an end.
• What are the implications of the feasibility find -
ings for the design of the main study?
Recruitment is most successful from secondary 
mental health services, with options for patient self-
referrals. Further development of the intervention 
and piloting to determine the primary endpoint are 
required before a larger trial is implemented.Background
The global burden of depression is well-recognised: 
Despite many effective treatments, around one in five 
diagnosed with an acute depressive disorder devel -
ops chronic depression [1 ]. The severity and course of 
symptoms vary from ‘milder’ symptoms of dysthymia to 
chronic major depression [2 ]. For this specific patient 
group, median durations are estimated between 5 and 
20  years [3 , 4] with associated increased health care 
costs through greater use of services and rates of hos -
pitalisation [5 –7]. Known risk factors include younger 
age of onset, childhood adversity and abuse [8 –18], 
family history of mood disorder and problems within 
the social environment (such as low social integration, 
support and negative social interaction) [3 ].
Chronic or persistent depression is defined by symp -
toms lasting 2 or more years. However, durations of 
1  year or longer are still both clinically relevant (in 
terms of distress) and may be indicative of a chronic 
course [8 , 19]. Around 40% of chronically depressed 
patients fulfil the criteria for treatment resistance, 
which can be identified as soon as 6 months post-diag -
nosis (or after two trials of antidepressant drugs) [20]. 
This suggests that symptoms enduring for 1  year or 
longer are both an indicator of future chronicity and a 
need for further intervention. For the purposes of this 
study, we use the term ‘long-term depression’ to define 
patients with symptoms of depression that have lasted 
1 year or longer.
Treatment of long-term depression is particularly 
difficult: Frequent relapses can lead to pessimism and 
demoralisation of both patient and professional [4 ] 
leading, in turn, to a lack of compliance or ‘giving up’ 
on treatment. There is evidence for both pharmaco -
therapy [21, 22] and psychotherapy [23] as effective 
treatments. These effects appear to be maximised when 
used in combination [24] although around 18 sessions 
of psychotherapy may be necessary in order to see clin -
ical effects [25]. A later review found limited evidence 
Page 3 of 30
 Carr et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:75 
 
for their use in combination [26] but suggested psycho -
therapy might have a continued role in promoting and 
maintaining treatment adherence, given patient pref -
erences are often for psychotherapy over medication 
and achieving wider clinical benefits (such as improved 
coping strategies and quality of life). As a result, clinical 
guidelines recommend combined treatment with a per -
sonalised approach [9 ].
There is good evidence for psychotherapy interventions 
that target interpersonal problems (such as the cognitive 
behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) 
and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) [27]. Similarly, 
long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy has been 
shown to improve long-term outcomes in treatment-
resistant depression [28]. Given the social environment 
is a known risk factor for this population [3, 29], group 
formats may promote social integration and interaction, 
provide emotional and social support and offer potential 
cost-effectiveness.
Group music therapy
Music therapy is a complex intervention provided by 
music therapists that uses a range of expressive and 
receptive musical activities, verbal reflection and the 
relationships developed through this to improve health 
[30]. Within the United Kingdom (UK), music therapists 
are regulated by the Health and Care Professions Coun -
cil (HCPC) and must have completed accredited Masters 
level training. Within the UK, practice most often uses a 
combination of active musical improvisation and verbal 
reflection within sessions, which can take an individual 
or group format.
There is promising evidence for the effectiveness of 
music therapy in treating depression [31] and it may 
benefit this population for several reasons. As an inter -
vention, it may be appealing and motivating given the 
different focus on use of the art form and thus encour -
age attendance and engagement [32, 33]. The experience 
of making music provides a very different therapeutic 
encounter; music has an immediate impact (often posi -
tive) on mood [34] and within groups (especially singing) 
can promote social bonding [35]. A positive experience 
within a community-based group may then place the 
person in contact with their musical and psychologi -
cal ‘resources’ [36], which—linking to wider theories of 
recovery in mental illness—may provide opportunities to 
build inner resources of coping, resilience and promote 
hope [37, 38].
Through co-created musical improvisation, it is pos -
sible to give sound to experience, express and transform 
feeling states, form relationships and communicate with 
others without words. These experiences may promote 
opportunities for more positive social interactions than those experienced verbally. The musical attunement 
facilitated by music therapists when improvising may 
help patients to experience nonverbal social contact, 
closeness, emotional containment and address feelings of 
social isolation [39]. This process is implicated in build -
ing initial therapeutic trust, which is an important factor 
for this patient group [40]. Notably, a randomised con -
trolled trial of individual psychodynamic improvisational 
music therapy for depression [41] found additional bene -
fits on alexithemia, suggesting that musical improvisation 
assisted patients in naming internal feeling states.
A further music therapy trial used group songwriting 
for patients with severe mental illness and demonstrated 
improved quality of life [33]. Creating bespoke songs as a 
group has the potential for participants to begin to find 
ways of putting their internal experiences into words and 
to have this supported through group discussion and 
music-making [42].
Clinical benefits are associated with the number of ses -
sions received. One meta-analysis [43] suggested around 
4 sessions would be required for a small effect on depres -
sive symptoms, 10 for a medium effect and 16 for a large 
effect. The impact of session frequency and duration is 
less clear. Within the UK, sessions are often offered on 
a weekly basis. However, internationally, frequency can 
range from 1 to 6 sessions per week [43].
In designing the intervention for this study, we con -
sulted with patient and carer groups, who suggested that 
singing would be a more accessible and acceptable way of 
making music than instrumental improvisation. They also 
emphasised the importance of having an ‘end product’ 
in promoting self-esteem, self-efficacy and achievement 
in their recovery. We therefore took a group songwrit -
ing protocol [33] as our starting point and through focus 
groups with music therapists and clinical psychologists 
and interviews with patients with depression, incorpo -
rated principles from psychodynamic improvisational 
music therapy [40] and resource-oriented music therapy 
[36, 44].
By offering a regular intensive group format (3 ses -
sions per week), we hypothesised that patients would 
have opportunities to make music together thus provid -
ing opportunities to build trust and bond with others, 
improve mood and build relationships. We hypothesised 
this could lead to a range of relevant outcomes such 
as short-term reduction in psychological distress and 
improved social functioning. The above could also con -
tribute to improved self-esteem and self-efficacy and, 
taken as a whole, a reduction in depression symptoms. 
Secondary impacts of a reduction in depression were 
hypothesised to be improved satisfaction with services, 
a reduced impact of depression upon work and life and 
improved quality of life.

Current evidence suggests group music therapy may 
offer an alternative and potentially clinically beneficial 
treatment for long-term depression. However, the inter -
vention has not been specified or tested specifically for 
this population using a group and songwriting format 
within a UK National Health Service (NHS). Whilst 
music therapy is commonly provided in NHS mental 
health care, provision is often to diagnostically hetero -
geneous groups. Similarly, whilst songwriting is a recog -
nised music therapy technique, it is less frequently used 
in the UK. It was therefore important to assess whether 
the intervention was delivered as described, and its gen -
eral acceptability to both patients and music therapists.
In terms of the research design, it was important to 
assess our proposed methods for identifying, recruiting 
and retaining participants. In particular, we were unsure 
of the numbers who might meet our definition of ‘long-
term’ depression, where they might be identified within 
services, nor of the best ways to identify them. Running 
the study on a small scale enabled us to examine how 
feasible our proposed processes were and to estimate the 
resources and most effective approaches required [45]. 
We were similarly unsure which measures might be most 
appropriate in terms of acceptability of completion, the 
variability of outcomes and what level of clustering might 
be expected within groups.
Aims and objectives
This study aimed to pilot a group songwriting music 
therapy intervention for patients with long-term depres -
sion and assess the feasibility and acceptability both of 
the intervention and of conducting a larger randomised 
controlled trial. In addition, the study sought to gather 
descriptive information on health service use in order to 
inform a future health economic evaluation.
Objectives
a) Feasibility and acceptability of research methodology
1. Assess the feasibility of recruitment processes
2. Identify the number of eligible participants, par -
ticipation and retention rates
3. Assess the researcher time required
4. Assess the appropriateness of outcome measures, 
including providing data on the variability of out -
come, an estimate of the control group mean and 
the intra-cluster correlation coefficient.
5. Assess the acceptability of the research method -
ology to professionals and patients
b) Feasibility and acceptability of intervention6. Assess the intervention in terms of testing use 
of components, measuring adherence and esti -
mating the likely intervention effect.
c) Assessment of service use for health economic evalu -
ation
7. Assess the services received by participants in 
preparation for a health economic evaluation.
Methods
A parallel two-arm randomised controlled feasibility 
trial with mixed methods evaluation. Participants were 
assessed at the point of enrolment (baseline), the week 
post-intervention and 3 and 6 months post-intervention. 
Shopping vouchers of £10 were offered at baseline and 
for subsequent assessments for treatment participants. 
Wait-list participants were paid £15 per follow-up to 
acknowledge the delay to treatment. The study was given 
favourable ethical opinion from the Health Research 
Authority (IRAS project ID: 198,964, REC reference:16/
WA/0248), and the study protocol was published with 
open access in March 2017 [46].
Four amendments were made during the study. We 
amended the patient information sheet and consent form 
to include the possibility of payment for travel to therapy 
sessions where patients did not hold a ‘freedom pass’; a 
substantial amendment was made to move the post-test 
assessment point from 1  month post-intervention to 
immediately at the intervention end to maximise follow-
up rates and capture any immediate treatment effects; we 
clarified payment of £10 for participation in qualitative 
interviews to ensure consistency with previous assess -
ments; finally, prior to commencing music therapy for 
the wait-list group, we opened up two spaces to patients 
outside the study to ensure a critical mass of group mem -
bers could be maintained.
Eligibility criteria
As this was a feasibility trial, our inclusion criteria were 
as broad as possible. Participants were eligible if they 
had a confirmed diagnosis in the International Classifi -
cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems (version 
10) (ICD10), of depression (ICD10 F31-39), including 
post-schizophrenic depression (ICD10 F20.4) and pro -
longed depressive reaction (ICD10 F43.21), had received 
pharmacological and/or psychological treatment for 
12 months or longer, were aged 18 years or above and had 
capacity to give written informed consent. We excluded 
any diagnosis of organic mental disorder (ICD10 F00-
09), bipolar affective disorder if current manic episode 
(ICD10 F30, F31.0, F31.2, F31.6, F31.7–4), if they lacked 
capacity to give informed consent or were at risk of

suicide necessitating hospitalisation. Previous receipt of 
music therapy or other psychological therapies did not 
form part of the eligibility criteria, but were recorded as 
part of baseline clinical characteristics.
Setting and participant identification
The study took place in East London NHS Foundation 
Trust. Research assistants recruited participants via (a) 
primary care, via General Practice (GP) surgeries and 
(b) secondary care via improving access to psychological 
therapies (IAPT) services and community mental health 
care teams. GP surgeries were invited to sign up to act 
as recruiting centres. A practice staff member then sent 
letters of invitation to any potentially eligible patients. 
Within secondary care, caseloads were screened by a 
clinical studies officer who was part of the care team 
and potential participants were approached by the pro -
fessional responsible for their care. An unexpected 
third means of recruitment was via patient self-referral 
through presentations about the study to patient and 
carer groups across the Trust. Where patients expressed 
interest, permission was gained to contact their health -
care professional to check eligibility and then a meeting 
arranged to go through informed consent.
Participant consent
Recruitment lasted for 8 weeks between September and 
November 2016. Interested patients were provided with 
an information sheet and then met with a member of the 
research team to give written informed consent and com -
plete baseline measures. To support retention, we aimed 
wherever possible for the researcher conducting baseline 
assessments to continue with that participant for all fol -
low-up assessments.
Intervention (Group music therapy with songwriting)
The Synchrony group music therapy with songwrit -
ing intervention is summarised according to the Tem -
plate for Intervention Description and Replication 
(TIDieR) checklist [47] in Table  1. A manual for the Syn -
chrony group music therapy with songwriting interven -
tion [Additional file  1], based on Grocke et  al. [33] and 
informed by individual psychodynamic music therapy 
for depression [40] and resource-oriented music ther -
apy [36], was developed prior to the study taking place 
through focus groups with music therapists, psycholo -
gists and interviews with patients with depression. The 
manual was finalised through regular meetings with the 
music therapists providing the intervention and Heads of 
Arts Therapies.
Adaptations to Grocke et  al. ’s intervention [33] 
included group members sharing pre-known songs in 
the early phases of the group; group improvisation after ice-breaker activities and before working on songs; and 
building time for the group to decide what they would 
like their end product to be (e.g. a compact disc (CD) or 
a group performance). Unlike Grocke et al. [33] who used 
a recording studio at the end of therapy, recording took 
place during the music therapy sessions using Garage -
Band software [48] and formed a major part of the group 
process.
Based on feedback from patient and carer groups, group 
music therapy took place in non-NHS premises in a com -
munity centre within one London borough. The centre 
offered facilities for additional social contact, such as a 
café and wider non-medical community groups. Ses -
sions were provided three times per week over 14 weeks 
by two HCPC-registered music therapists. Sessions lasted 
90  minutes and consisted of opening warm-up activities 
(such as passing an instrument), sharing current state 
(which, with permission, was written onto a flip chart for 
later lyric writing) and then moving into group improvi -
sation. Music therapists transitioned into songwrit -
ing from this point, focusing on lyric creation, musical 
ideas or motifs and later recording. Opportunities were 
offered after each activity for verbal reflection. The last 
15 minutes were dedicated to reviewing the session either 
through group discussion, or by playing music together.
Wait‑list control
The wait-list control group received treatment as usual 
for the study duration, which involved either psychop -
harmacological medication, psychological therapy or 
a combination. At the end of the final follow-up assess -
ment, a further songwriting music therapy group was 
offered to these participants.
Assessment measures
The purpose of a feasibility study is to determine whether 
or not it is possible to proceed with a given interven -
tion or research design before moving to a larger scale 
[49]. In order to do this, it is recommended to estab -
lish pre-defined stop–go criteria [49] to aid the deci -
sion of whether or not to proceed. Whilst the criteria 
can vary from study to study, many take the format of 
a ‘traffic light’ system to aid identification of thresholds 
where a criterion is feasible (‘green’), not feasible (‘red’) 
or potentially feasible with modifications (‘amber’). Our 
pre-defined stop–go criteria were published in the study 
protocol [46] and are summarised in Table 2.

Table 1 TIDieR [47] summary of the Synchrony group music therapy with songwriting intervention
TIDieR item Description
1 Brief name Synchrony group music therapy with songwriting for chronic depression
2 Why Chronic depression is associated with challenges with low mood, motivation and social isolation. Group formats may 
promote social integration, interaction, provide emotional and social support and offer potential cost-effectiveness [3, 29]
Music therapy has promising evidence in treating depression [31] and offers a different therapeutic encounter. The inter -
vention may be appealing and motivating encouraging attendance and engagement. Music has an immediate (often 
positive) impact upon mood [34] which may reduce symptom distress and within groups (especially singing), can pro -
mote social bonding [35]. Musical improvisation may support initial nonverbal communication of feeling states and aid 
patients in learning to name these [41]. Group songwriting may further aid verbal expression of internal experiences and 
is associated with improved quality of life [33]. Patient and carer groups value the accessibility of singing and importance 
of an ‘end product’ in promoting self-esteem, self-efficacy and achievement in recovery
By offering a regular intensive group format, patients will have opportunities to make music together thus providing 
opportunities to build trust and bond with others, improve mood and build relationships. We hypothesise this will lead 
to short-term reduction in psychological distress and improved social functioning. The above will contribute to improved 
self-esteem and self-efficacy and taken as a whole, a reduction in depression symptoms. Secondary impacts of reduced 
depression will be improved satisfaction with services, reduced impact of depression upon work and life and improved 
quality of life

enspiel, harmonica, thumb piano, chime bars, hand bells, etc
• 2–4 microphones for recording and stand
• Recording equipment: zoom digital audio recorder, iPad with compatible external microphone and Garageband or 
similar software
• Amplification for iPad and electric guitar/keyboard where required

4 What: procedures Group music therapy with songwriting, based on an adapted songwriting intervention [33] and informed by psychody-
namic music therapy for depression [40] and resource-oriented music therapy [36]
1. Pre-therapy induction session with music therapists to meet each other, set expectations, answer questions and intro -
duce the equipment and sorts of music-making that will happen
2. Text message reminders sent to participants to encourage group attendance
3. First session: Extended introductions, overview of 14-week schedule, group rules, introduction to songwriting
4. General group structure and format: Instrumental/body warm up and check in. Initial sessions use reflection on a piece 
of music brought to the session by a group member. Music therapists encourage group discussion. Warm-up improvisa-
tion using a theme from previous discussion to prepare for songwriting. Group reflection on the experience and ideas/
themes they wish to take forward into the songwriting. Group songwriting with option to rehearse and/or perform 
elements. End of session check in on how feeling now compared to the beginning. Reflection on the group events and 
decisions
5. Sessions 2–31: Songwriting and developing group song list
6. Sessions 32–42: Group review and closure—Sessions are dedicated to reviewing the songs written, including possibility 
to rehearse and record or perform. Reflection on group processes and relationships
5 Provider Two HCPC-registered NHS music therapists
6 How Face-to-face, group format, up to 10 participants per group
7 Where Community centre, room with space to seat up to 12 (10 participants and 2 music therapists). Some décor such as paint -
ings, plants, natural light. Reasonable soundproofing from interior to exterior. Room to be free from interruption or loud 
external noise for duration of session. Wifi to enable access to the internet for song-sharing and mobile phone signal
8 When/how much
a) Intensity High intensity
b) Frequency Three sessions per week
c) Session time 90 min consisting of 60 min session with 15 min pre/post for socialisation
d) Overall duration 14 weeks
9 Tailoring Group structure was permitted to become more flexible (in terms of improvisation and songwriting content) as sessions 
progressed to tailor to the evolving needs of the group. Songwriting elements are used interchangeably where appropri-
ate to aid the songwriting process (creating lyrics, developing the song, choosing genre, developing rhythmic structure, 
developing verse/chorus melody, choosing mode/harmony, adding instrumental accompaniment/possibilities for 
improvisation, rehearsing, final song performance)

participation and retention rates (objective 2) were 
assessed through descriptive analysis of recruitment and 
drop-out rates and qualitative end interviews with par -
ticipants and referring staff. Researcher time (objective 3) 
was assessed through researchers keeping logs of contact, 
dates of visits and time taken throughout the study. Out -
come measure appropriateness (objective 4) was assessed 
by examining descriptive statistics and missing data. For 
clinical outcomes, our proposed primary endpoint was in 
the week following the intervention end (post-interven -
tion), with secondary endpoints 3 and 6  months post-
intervention. Acceptability of the research methodology 
to participants and patients (objective 5) was assessed 
through thematic analysis of qualitative interviews at the 
end of intervention.
(b) Feasibility/acceptability of the intervention (objective 
6)
Feasibility/acceptability of the intervention (objec -
tive 6) was assessed through a nested process evalua -
tion which aimed to understand (a) how the intervention 
was delivered in practice (treatment fidelity analysis), (b) 
describe processes of attendance and hypothesised pro -
cess factors of self-reported depression, mood and group 
relationships from week to week and (c) understand 
subjective experiences and attributions for change of 
the intervention from the perspective of patients, music 
therapists and referring staff. To assess treatment fidel -
ity, music therapist self-reported adherence to the man -
ual each session and video analysis of 25% of sessions by 
independent raters (both music therapists) was collected 
using the same adherence proforma. To examine attend -
ance and hypothesised process factors, group attendance, 
self-reported depression and weekly process measures of 
mood and group relationships were collected. For sub -
jective experiences and change attributions, end of ther -
apy interviews were conducted with patients and music 
therapists using the Client Change Interview [50]. This 
was adapted for referring staff and music therapists to reflect on changes observed in participants. Qualitative 
interviews were conducted by unblinded members of the 
research team and clinical studies officers supporting the 
study. Finally, as part of good clinical practice, adverse 
events were monitored throughout the study and were 
considered in relation to intervention safety and potential 
adverse outcomes.
 (iii) Health service use (objective 7)
Health service use data were collected by examining 
medical records for any hospitalisation and using the Cli -
ent Services Receipt Inventory at baseline, in the week 
following the intervention (post-intervention), 3 and 
6 months post-intervention.
Proposed primary symptom outcomes
Both observer-rated and self-report measures were used 
to assess depression symptoms.
Montgomery‑Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [51]
The MADRS is an observer-rated 10-item scale known 
to be sensitive to change with good predictive valid -
ity for major depressive disorder [52]. Symptoms are 
rated from 0 (not present) to 6 (extreme problems) 
and summed to form a total score (0–60). Research 
Assistants were trained in its use with the accompa -
nying interview guide (SIGMA [53]) prior to assess -
ments with high inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.995 
(p < 0.001), 95% CI 0.987–0.999). Estimates for the 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) range 
from a 1.6 to 1.9 change from baseline with remission 
cut-off at < 9 points [54, 55]. Bandelow et  al. found 
scores ≤ 5 are symptom-free remission, ≤ 11 remission 
and a decrease in 39% from baseline corresponded to 
‘much improved’ on the clinical global impressions

sensitivity to change and established cutoffs for minimal 
(raw score < 13), mild (14–19), moderate (20–28) and 
severe (29–63) depression [58]. Items are rated on a scale 
of 0 (no problems) to 3 (extreme problems), and summed 
to form a total score (0–63). The estimated MCID is esti -
mated at either a reduction of 5 points [59, 60] or a 30% 
reduction in total score [61], 17.5% reduction in scores 
for depressed patients and 32% for those with a longer 
duration and non-response to antidepressants [62].
Secondary and exploratory outcomes
Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) [63]
The BSI is a widely used 53-item self-report measure of 
psychological distress with good internal consistency 
and established outpatient norms in both United States 
and UK samples [63, 64]. Symptoms are rated on a Likert 
scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). There are nine 
subscales for symptom clusters (0–4) and three global 
indices of distress; global severity index, positive symp -
tom distress index and positive symptom total, of which 
global severity is used as a single summary measure.
Rosenberg self‑esteem scale (RSES) [65]
The RSES is a widely used 10-item self-report measure 
of self-esteem. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale 
from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’ . Four items are 
reverse scored, and item totals are summed (0–40). The 
scale has good internal consistency (0.68–0.86) [66] and 
construct validity [67].
General Perceived Self‑efficacy Scale (GPSES) [68]
The GPSES is a 10-item self-report measure of personal 
agency, rated on a 4-point Likert scale from ‘not at all 
true’ to ‘exactly true’ . Item totals are summed (10–40). 
The scale has confirmed uni-dimensionality and good 
internal consistency (0.82–0.93) [68].
Client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ) [69]
The CSQ measures self-reported satisfaction with ser -
vices and is rated on an 8-item scale from 1 (dissatisfied) 
to 4 (very satisfied) and items summed (8–32). The scale 
is widely used in health services research and has good 
internal consistency (0.83–0.93) [69].
Work and social adjustment scale (WSAS) [70]
The WSAS is a self-report 5-item scale that measures the 
degree to which work and social life are impaired due to 
a health condition. Items are rated on an 8-point scale 
from 0 (not at all impaired) to 8 (very severely impaired). 
Item totals are summed (0–40). The scale has demon -
strated internal consistency (0.70–0.94) and a test–retest 
correlation of 0.73 [70].Manchester Short Quality of Life scale (MANSA) [71]
The MANSA is a 16-item self-report scale measuring 
satisfaction with different areas of life. Twelve items are 
rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (‘couldn’t 
be worse’) to 7 (‘couldn’t be better) which are summed 
(12–84). Four items are dichotomous (yes/no) to indi -
cate whether the person has a close friend, saw a friend 
in the last week, was accused of a crime or was a victim 
of physical violence. The scale has good internal con -
sistency (0.74) and correlations of 0.83 and higher with 
the longer Lancashire Quality of Life Profile [71].
Life Skills Profile (LSP) [72]
The LSP is an observer-rated 39-item profile, origi -
nally designed for patients with schizophrenia. Various 
domains of social functioning are rated on a 4-point 
scale from no difficulty (4) to considerable difficulty (1). 
Items are summed into five subscales: self-care, non-
turbulence, social contact, communication and respon -
sibility and overall functioning score (39–154). Internal 
consistency ranges from 0.67 to 0.88, and the scale 
demonstrated good sensitivity to change in community 
patients with chronic mental illness within an assertive 
outreach service [73].
Level of hospitalisation
Psychiatric hospital admissions, length of stay and 
readmissions were recorded from medical records for 
the purposes of this study.
Client services receipt inventory (CSRI) [74]
The CSRI was used to collect information on face-to-
face professional contacts, use of day care services, 
contact with police, medications, time off work/college 
and receipt of state benefits.
Process measures
Within the treatment arm, process measures of mood 
and group relationships were administered once per 
week pre- and post-session. In addition, the BDI-II 
was completed post-session in weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12 of 
the intervention to track any self-reported changes in 
depression during the intervention period. Attendance 
was logged by the therapist at every session, and rea -
sons for non-attendance were recorded. Finally, quali -
tative end of therapy interviews were completed with 
participants in both treatment and wait-list groups. 
These interviews were optional for participants.
Dispositional Mood Scale (DMS) [75, 76]
The DMS is a self-report scale consisting of 20 adjec -
tives describing current internal states. Adjectives are 
Page 11 of 30
 Carr et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:75 
 
rated on a scale of 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 
(extremely) and summed as four subscales of positive 
energy, tiredness, negative activation and relaxation. 
A further two-factor solution is possible: ‘Pleasant-
Activation, Unpleasant Deactivation’ and ‘Unpleasant 
activation, Pleasant deactivation’ . Internal consistency 
varies between α: 0.83 and 0.93 [75].
Relationship Satisfaction Scale (RSS) [77]
The RSS is a 7-item self-report scale assessing the qual -
ity of a relationship. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert 
scale from 0 (‘very dissatisfied’) to 6 (‘very satisfied’) and 
summed to form an overall satisfaction score. The scale 
has not been validated, but assessed domains of rel -
evance to group relationships (e.g. communication and 
openness, conflict resolution, intimacy and closeness).
Music therapy group attendance
Attendance was recorded by the music therapists every 
session on a pre-designed proforma, including space to 
record reasons for non-attendance.
Experience of therapy and research incorporating adapted 
client change interview [50]
A topic guide was pre-designed to enquire about expe -
riences of both the therapy and taking part in the study 
in qualitative interviews. For participants in the treat -
ment arm, the Client Change Interview [50] was used to 
explore helpful and hindering factors in therapy, changes 
experienced during therapy and attributions for this.
Adverse events
Adverse events were recorded from the point of written 
informed consent to 7  days post-cessation of the study. 
Active monitoring commenced from the first point of 
attendance of group music therapy to 1  week after the 
intervention finished. Expected adverse events were 
defined as:
• A participant exhibiting aggression (nonverbal or 
verbal behaviour)
• A participant causing harm to another person
• Disclosure of thoughts or plans which may place the 
individual or others at risk of harm.
Serious adverse events that were defined for this study 
context included:
• A participant making a suicide attempt
• A participant causing life threatening injury to 
another• An event occurring during the course of the study 
which resulted in hospitalisation or prolongation of 
existing hospitalisation related to their mental health.
Rationale for sample size
Papers considering sample size for feasibility studies sug -
gest inclusion of upwards of 24–50 participants [78–80]. 
As the feasibility of our recruitment processes and sam -
ple were unknown, we based our sample size around 
what was practicable to provide within the study time -
frame. We aimed to recruit 30 patients to participate in 
three groups of 10 patients in each. Participation rates 
in similar studies were between 25% and 33% of eligible 
patients consenting [81–83]. A sample size of 30 would 
allow us to estimate a participation rate of 25% to within 
95% confidence interval of + / − 15%. We estimated 1300 
patients would be eligible within primary care (assum -
ing one fifth of those with current depression) and 
that each practice in the locality would therefore have 
around 20 with enduring symptoms. Secondary care ser -
vices reported around 1960 patients with a diagnosis of 
depression, suggesting 392 would be potentially eligible 
for this study. Assuming a participation rate of 25%, we 
aimed to approach 128 patients, with the aim of recruit -
ing 4 per week over 8–10 weeks.
Randomisation
To gain sufficient information regarding the interven -
tion, we used an imbalanced design, randomising 20 par -
ticipants to group music therapy and 10 to the wait-list 
control. We used simple block randomisation once all 30 
participants were recruited and baseline measures com -
pleted. Randomisation was generated by a researcher 
independent to the study team, using the Experimen -
tal Design Generator and Randomiser (EDGAR-II) [84]. 
One unblinded study team member and music thera -
pists were informed of the allocation, who then informed 
participants.
Blinding
Researchers conducting assessments and the co-Chief 
Investigator (Priebe) were blinded to participant allo -
cation. Due to the trial design, participants, music 
therapists and the clinical teams were not blinded to allo -
cation. One Chief Investigator (Carr) and Clinical Studies 
Officers were unblinded to enable communication with 
clinicians and administration of process measures.
To maintain blinding of researchers, it was explained 
to participants on allocation that it was important not 
to reveal this to the researcher who had conducted 
their assessments. Participants were reminded in every 
Page 12 of 30 Carr et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:75 
communication from researchers not to mention 
whether they had received music therapy or not.
Analysis
For research methodology feasibility measures (objec -
tives 1–4), we calculated screening, recruitment and 
drop-out rates, distributions of baseline characteristics 
and all outcomes 1 week and 3 and 6 months post-inter -
vention. Clinical outcomes were analysed as intention-
to-treat, using mean scores for each group and 95% 
confidence intervals. We then used a mixed linear model, 
adjusting for baseline scores of the given outcome and 
any significant baseline characteristics. The intra-cluster 
correlation coefficient was calculated for group cluster -
ing. Adverse events were categorised and reported for 
each trial arm.
For intervention feasibility measures (objective 6), 
we explored using descriptive statistics, any differences 
between compliant/non-compliant attenders, respond -
ers and non-responders. Qualitative interviews were ana -
lysed in two stages. In the first stage, participants who 
had received music therapy were analysed to explore 
their experiences of the intervention and any changes 
(objective 6) using interpretative phenomenological anal -
ysis [85]. This enabled us to gain an in-depth understand -
ing of participants’ experiences during the songwriting 
groups including the meaning attributed by participants 
to their experiences. Further details of the analysis and 
findings are published in full elsewhere [85]. In a sec -
ond stage, given the larger number of interviews and 
pre-defined format of research procedures, comments 
relating to acceptability and experiences of research 
procedures (objective 1) were analysed using deductive 
coding against each element of the research design and 
then grouped to form a basic thematic analysis [86]. For 
health service use (objective 7), hospitalisation and use 
of services were examined descriptively and compared 
between groups.
Results
Feasibility and acceptability of research methodology 
(objectives 1–5)
Recruitment
Flow of participants in the study is shown in the Con -
solidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 
diagram (Fig.  1) and baseline characteristics in Table  3. 
A total of 421 patients were screened and 235 poten -
tially eligible participants identified. Reasons for exclu -
sion at this stage were not meeting the inclusion 
criteria (N = 105), no clinician assent for contact (N = 63), 
researchers unable to make contact (N = 25) or partici -
pants being deemed too unwell to approach (N = 13) or 
unsuitable by clinicians (N = 5). Five were discharged from services before they could be approached. Of the 
235 participants approached, 83 expressed interest with a 
participation rate (from potentially eligible participants) 
of 12.7%. Forty-six declined whilst 146 were unable to 
contact or did not respond. One GP practice participant 
expressed interest but was too late to join the study, and 
one self-referred participant was too unwell to recruit 
within the study window. Whilst there were equivalent 
numbers of potentially eligible participants within GP 
and Community Mental Health settings, recruitment 
was most successful via Community Mental Health 
teams (CMHT) and self-referral from public engagement 
events. The recruitment target was achieved, with 30 
participants providing informed consent over an 8-week 
period and recruitment rate of 12.5% (Table  4). Recruit -
ment was initially slow with six participants recruited in 
the first 4 weeks and recruitment then peaking in weeks 
5 (9 recruited) and 8 (5 recruited) (Table  4). Researcher 
time was adequate to cover the necessary research tasks 
over the course of the study.
Baseline characteristics
Participants were on average 44  years old, with the 
majority holding a diagnosis of recurrent depressive 
disorder (ICD10 F33.0, 12/30 participants). Mean dura -
tion of diagnosis was 10.7 years (range, 1–40 years). Few 
(3/30) had previously attended music therapy. Groups 
differed significantly at baseline regarding gender (65% 
of the treatment arm were female compared to 30% in 
the wait-list arm), self-efficacy, BSI scores and life skills 
of self-care and communication. The treatment arm also 
had a greater proportion of participants with English as 
a second language. Depression symptom severity had 
high variance, with participants scoring a large range 
of the MADRS (0–48), and BDI-II (1–48). Two wait-list 
participants met the criteria for remission at baseline 
(< 9) on the MADRS, whilst seven met criteria for mild 
or moderate depression on the BDI-II (3 in treatment, 4 
in wait-list).
Retention
Ten participants withdrew from the study between allo -
cation and post-intervention with 60% retention (n = 18) 
at 6-month follow-up. On allocation, one wait-list partic -
ipant withdrew due to no longer being able to take part. 
The remaining nine withdrawals were in the treatment 
arm, of which six did not attend any sessions. Those who 
did not attend withdrew from both study and interven -
tion due to being unable to commit to the group sched -
ule (n = 2), life events (n = 2), symptom severity (n = 1) 
and loss of contact (n = 1). Of those who did attend, 
one was withdrawn due to risk after the first session, 
one felt that the study was not of benefit to depression

after four sessions and one felt further study participa -
tion was invalid having only attended three sessions and 
gained employment. At 3 months follow-up, one further 
treatment participant who did not attend any sessions 
withdrew due to too many other commitments and one 
wait-list participant due to commencing employment. 
Outside of withdrawals, two separate losses to follow-up 
occurred, once at 3 months and once at 6 months in the 
treatment arm.
Blinding
There were four instances of unblinding. One post-
allocation, where an intervention participant called 
the researcher to inform of the outcome; twice when arranging 1  week post-intervention assessments with 
intervention participants and one wait-list participant at 
the 6-month follow-up. In the three cases of scheduling 
assessments, all were due to participants sharing upcom -
ing intervention-based appointments. With two blinded 
team members, there was capacity within the research 
team to cover these assessments enabling all assessments 
to be completed with blinding intact.
Clinical outcomes
Raw and adjusted outcomes are shown in Tables  5 and 6 
respectively.
Primary outcome—MADRS
Groups differed at baseline (treatment 25.85, wait-list 
19.20) with greater severity in the treatment group. 
Measures indicated a worsening of symptoms in both 
groups post-intervention (treatment 31.28; wait-list 
25.51), with the treatment group then improving to bet -
ter than baseline at 3- and 6-month follow-ups (3 month

than baseline scores at 3 and 6 months (3 months: 23.51; 
6  month 23.31). The intra-class correlation coefficient, 
demonstrating the level of clustering between groups was 
0.088.
After adjusting for baseline scores, a change of greater

not at 1 week or 6 months post-intervention (Fig.  2). Four 
participants in each arm saw reductions of more than 
39%, equating to ‘much improved’ on the Clinical Global 
Impressions scale. For the four treatment participants, 
this was 3 and 6 months post-intervention. For the four 
wait-list participants, this was across all follow-up time -
points. Three participants qualified for remission (scores 
less than 9): One participant in the treatment arm (com -
pliant attender) qualified as complete remission (< 5) and 
two in the wait-list arm (< 9). Both the wait-list partici -
pants in remission withdrew from the study at the point 
of offer of music therapy.
Secondary outcomes
Treatment group scores were worse compared to the 
wait-list group on all secondary measures 1  week post-
intervention apart from BSI Somatisation (treatment: 
2.08; wait-list 2.09) and BSI Hostility (treatment 1.74; 
wait-list 1.88). In the treatment group, mean difference 
improvements from baseline to 1  week post-interven -
tion were seen in self-efficacy (+ 0.88), LSP communica -
tion (+ 1.64) and BSI subscales of somatisation (-0.36), 
interpersonal sensitivity (− 0.18), depression (− 0.17), 
anxiety (− 0.24), hostility (− 0.82), phobia (− 0.17), para -
noia (− 0.21), psychosis (− 0.15), global severity (− 0.17), 
positive symptom totals (− 1.05) and positive symptom 
distress (− 0.22). In the wait-list group, all scales scored 
worse in mean differences from baseline to 1 week post-
intervention apart from LSP subscales of non-turbulence 
(+ 0.05), social communication (+ 0.07), communication 
(+ 0.49) and responsibility (+ 0.05).
At 3  months, treatment group scores were more 
favourable compared to the wait-list group on all 
measures except the BDI-II (treatment 30.72; wait-
list 29.60), CSQ (treatment 21.46; wait-list, 22.86) and 
WSAS (treatment 27.71, wait-list, 27.07). The treat -
ment group showed mean difference improvements 
compared to baseline on all measures apart from CSQ 
(− 2.69), WSAS (+  0.86) and LSP social contact (−  0.97). 
The wait-list group showed mean difference deteriora -
tion compared to baseline on all measures apart from 
satisfaction (+  0.66), LSP non-turbulence (+  1.94), LSP 
communication (+  0.04) and BSI Obsessive–Compul -
sive subscale (−  0.02).
At 6  months, scores favoured the treatment group 
on CSQ (treatment, 22.56; wait-list, 20.17), MANSA 
(treatment, 3.67; wait-list 3.41), BSI subscales of soma -
tisation (treatment 1.73; wait-list 1.78), interpersonal 
sensitivity (treatment 2.18, wait-list, 2.28), depression 
(treatment 2.42; wait-list 2.57), psychoticisim (treat -
ment 2.56; wait-list, 2.74) and LSP self-care (treat -
ment 35.82; wait-list 33.06), non-turbulence (treatment 45.46; wait-list 44.89), Communication (treatment 
22.30, wait-list, 22.22) and LSP sum score (treatment 
137.60; wait-list 133.91). Mean difference change com -
pared to baseline was favourable on all measures apart 
from BDI-II (+  3.08), Satisfaction (−  1.59), Self-esteem 
(− 2.25), WSAS (+  6.89) and BSI Obsessive–Compul -
sive (+  0.51). Wait-list mean difference scores deteriori -
ated compared to baseline on all measures apart from 
the LSP sum score and subscales (LSP SUM + 0.01).
A negative MCID was detected 1 week post-interven -
tion for the treatment arm after adjusting for baseline 
scores in the BDI-II (gain of 5.26). A positive BDI-II 
MCID was detected in three treatment group and four 
wait-list group participants via reduction of 5 + points, 
whilst two treatment and four wait-list participants 
had reductions of > 30%. Two treatment participants 
and five wait-list participants met criteria for ‘minimal’ 
depression.
Acceptability of research methodology to professionals 
and patients (objective 5)
End interviews with 10 participants and 7 clinical staff 
indicated generally good acceptability of the research 
methodology and study procedures. Clinicians stated 
that the referral process had been easy. Referrers were 
positive about the intervention being offered, par -
ticularly its intensity and opportunities for socialisa -
tion and enjoyment. One suggested that it had been 
a reminder that more was available than cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT). Patients declined par -
ticipation mostly due to not being interested or to 
the time commitment of attending groups. Clinicians 
valued researchers being physically present in clinics 
to reduce delays between the study offer by the clini -
cian and researcher contact. Written study informa -
tion and weekly email reminders were appreciated 
alongside prompt responses to clinical queries. The 
music therapists reported challenges in not assess -
ing participants prior to groups and suggested that 
group allocations post-intervention should take into 
account individual characteristics beyond capacity to 
attend a morning or afternoon group. There were fur -
ther challenges as the music therapists worked across 
more than one clinical borough, requiring rapid famil -
iarisation with wider clinical teams. Similarly, where 
participants did not clearly fall under a specific care 
pathway, this led in some cases to the music therapists 
having to case hold whilst awaiting allocation to the 
relevant team. Music therapists reported joint work -
ing with the research team as supportive especially 
when linking up for weekly process measures which 
often provided further evidence to back up clinical 
concerns.

Participants spoke positively about their experiences 
of participating in research even if their experience in 
music therapy was less so. Some likened being invited 
to “winning the lottery” . Written materials were help -
ful as were consistent and clear communication. Whilst 
waiting for the allocation caused some apprehension, 
participants felt well-enough informed to accept that 
this was something they had signed up to. Participants 
valued the relationships that they built with research -
ers and the continuity of seeing the same person each 
time along with flexibility for appointments. They cited 
understanding, friendliness, support, encouragement 
to attend the next appointment and being thanked for 
their time as important. The vouchers provided after 
assessments were welcomed and cited as a good incen -
tive to continue with research assessments. One par -
ticipant suggested smaller denominations so that there 
was more flexibility in what could be purchased.
Acceptability of outcome measures
Outcome measures were generally acceptable to partici -
pants with < 1% of items missing. No items were missing 
on the primary measure of the MADRS. Three participants 
struggled to answer CSQ questions relating to services 
before they attended music therapy (e.g. CSQ-B – Did you 
get the kind of service you wanted?). A few participants 
declined to answer questions relating to sex (MANSA 
item 13, BDI-II item 21). Items 17, 18 (taking and accept -
ing medication) and 25 (problems living with others) of the 
LSP were most often rated as not applicable by researchers.
Some participants found the assessment questions anxi -
ety provoking but the majority stated they found them help -
ful and appreciated that they went into depth about current 
issues and provoked reflection on how things were right 
now. The length of follow-up duration was also appreciated. 
Participants who were less literate suggested that it was 
challenging to complete but that researchers gave sufficient 
support in order to answer the questions. The most prob -
lematic assessment was the LSP , which researchers found 
awkward to administer in a face-to-face interview. Introduc -
tory text was added to explain the purpose of the questions 
to facilitate this. The CSRI also required updating when 
participants noted that the benefits system had changed to 
those that were in the questionnaire. Participants particu -
larly appreciated the process measures which they stated 
helped them to notice changes from week to week.
Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention (objective 6)
Compliance
Mean attendance was 10.5 (SD 13.8) out of a possible 42 
sessions (25%) with modes of 3 group members per ses -
sion in one group and 2 group members per session in the other. Participants split into compliant (N = 6, mean 
27.8/66% sessions), non-compliant (n = 8, mean 3.5/8% 
sessions) and non-attenders (n = 6). Five out of six com -
pliant attenders had lower MADRS scores than non-
compliant, although one compliant attender scored the 
maximum (range 18–48) (Fig. 3).
Reasons for non-attendance linked directly to study 
withdrawal. Four participants with low baseline MADRS 
scores (< 15) withdrew early on. One wait-list partici -
pant who was recruited from a CMHT scored 0 on the 
MADRS and withdrew prior to the 1  week post-inter -
vention follow-up. Two were participants recruited from 
Talking Therapies who both withdrew due to commenc -
ing employment (one having attended 3 sessions). One 
participant recruited from the CMHT withdrew due to 
childcare issues having attended one session.
Two out of the four participants recruited from GP 
practices did not attend despite scores of > 30 on the 
MADRS, one due to housing and carer issues and one 
due to loss of contact. The remaining four non-attend -
ing participants had baseline MADRS scores ranging 
from 20 to 30 and did not attend due to venue acces -
sibility, worsening of symptoms and being unable to 
commit to the group and life events.
Of the eight non-compliant attenders, one was with -
drawn to risk, two requested to withdraw from the 
group due to group conflict and one left due to com -
mencing employment. The remaining four attended 
over the course of therapy but faced significant chal -
lenges due to refugee status, carer responsibilities, 
homelessness and family illness.
Based on low attendance figures, we opened up 
places to non-study participants for the wait-list group. 
Two additional patients were offered places left by the 
two study withdrawals but did not complete any study 
assessments or measures. One attended regularly and 
one did not attend due to worsening of symptoms prior 
to the group starting. Of the wait-list study partici -
pants, attendance was higher (mean 19.4/46%, SD 15.8) 
with mode of 5 participants per session. Five partici -
pants were compliant (mean 30.8/73% sessions). One 
ceased attendance after a single session and lost contact 
with the research team, one after 6 sessions and one did 
not attend.
Adherence
Mean manual adherence was 44.45% (SD 25.94) with 
moderate reliability when coded by an independent rater. 
The music therapists used all components of the manual 
over the course of the groups but with different sections 
being used at particular times in the therapy process (for 
example, greater focus on introductory activities in early 
sessions, recording happening later on in the therapy 
Page 21 of 30
 Carr et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:75 
 
process). In the two treatment groups, seven song record -
ings were made. One instrumental recording and a num -
ber of improvisations were made in the wait-list group.
The music therapists suggested that further instruc -
tion on how to complete adherence forms would have 
built their confidence alongside a different design of the 
forms that allowed for a less linear approach to the group 
process.
Process measures
Due to low attendance, process measures of mood and 
relationship satisfaction were available for only ten par -
ticipants (morning group: 6/10, afternoon group: 4/10) 
and only six for depression (BDI-II: morning group 3/10, 
afternoon group 3/10). Plots of pre and post mood scores 
(Fig.  4) suggested an increase in positive energy, relaxa -
tion and reduction in tiredness and negative activation 
in the morning group alongside improvements in rela -
tionship satisfaction (Fig.  5). The afternoon group dem -
onstrated a different picture whereby earlier sessions 
reported an increase in negative activation and lower 
relationship satisfaction scores in the first 4  weeks and less marked mood differences pre- and post-session. For 
the BDI-II (Fig.  6), depression scores reduced in both 
groups between weeks 3 and 6, but then increased again 
between weeks 6 and 9. There was a reduction in depres -
sion in week 12 in the afternoon group.
Experiences of the intervention
Ten participants took part in qualitative interviews. 
In terms of group experiences, three superordinate 
themes were identified: The group as a happy and safe 
place; Music stimulates new feelings and songwriting 
aids expression into words; Uncertainty, unmet needs 
and the ending were challenging. Further detail on 
these experiences of the therapy can be found in Win -
dle et  al. [85]. Participants reported an average of 5 
changes (range 1–9) whilst referring clinicians reported 
observing an average of three changes in their patients. 
The majority of these changes were positive, the most 
common being linked to musical engagement, changes 
in mood and confidence. Three participants reported 
increased engagement in other activities whilst three 
reported negative changes in terms of nervousness, Fig. 3 Scatter plot of baseline MADRS score and number of music therapy sessions attended by group

feeling worse at the end of therapy and becoming more 
housebound. Three of the wait-list group participants 
reported changes they had hoped for, but did not hap -
pen, namely: a wish to change memory of trauma, 
to change how they thought and a wish to have been 
more involved in the group. Participants tended to be 
surprised by the changes that they had noticed (65% 
of changes were rated as 4 or 5 on the Client Change 
Interview expectancy-surprised scale) and believed 
them to be unlikely to have happened without therapy 
(58% of changes rated as 1 or 2 on the likelihood scale). 
All participants rated their changes as moderately to 
extremely important (3–5 on the importance scale).
Accessibility of the therapy location, session fre -
quency and managing the group ending were described 
as challenging by participants. Participants suggested 
longer sessions (e.g. 2 hours) but twice per week would 
be preferable to three times per week.
The music therapists reported challenges in the 
make-up of each therapy group alongside high levels of 
drop-out and the impact on group members. Further 
attention to the make-up of the group was suggested 
post-randomisation to ensure a good mix and balance of 
participants.
The music therapists spoke positively about the poten -
tial of group songwriting for this client group, especially 
techniques of song-sharing and combining check-ins and 
improvisation as a basis for songwriting. They reported 
some challenges in group songwriting that were beyond 
their usual scope of practice. Deciding how far to inter -
vene in the songwriting process was described as chal -
lenging in the beginning but they observed greater 
sophistication in the groups’ ability to create over time. 
Technology, whilst opening up new musical and record -
ing possibilities was a challenge and they suggested that 
the manual should include more on editing and record -
ing processes.Potential harms and unintended effects
A total of six adverse events (four in the treatment arm, 
two in the control) and one serious adverse event (treat -
ment arm) were reported during the study (Table  7) in 
seven different participants. All but one (fainting during 
a research assessment) were expected events.
The most frequent adverse event was increased sui -
cide risk, identified during the research assessments. 
One participant disclosed a risk to self/others in a fol -
low-up assessment which appeared unrelated directly 
to the intervention but could possibly have been related 
to the recent ending of the group. Within the treatment 
arm, events that occurred during the treatment phase 
included one verbal threat and one increased suicide risk, 
identified during completion of process measures. The 
verbal threat was assessed as probably unrelated given 
this participant’s risk history although it is not possible to 
say for certain if events in the group were a contributing 
factor. Two instances of homelessness were also reported 
which, whilst not meeting the definition of an adverse 
event, were reported as safeguarding alerts following 
local Trust policies.
Hospitalisation of one treatment arm participant hap -
pened during the follow-up assessment period and was 
reported as a serious adverse event. This participant did 
not attend any group sessions and withdrew without 
completing further assessments.
Health service use (objective 7)
Health service contacts reduced in both groups with a 
greater reduction in the treatment arm. There were no 
further hospital admissions for mental health problems 
in either arm post-baseline. Third sector contacts for self-
help and leisure activities increased from baseline in the 
treatment arm 1  week post-intervention and 6  months 
follow-up but were reduced at 3 months follow-up.Table 7 Adverse events and classification by treatment arm

Discussion
This feasibility trial piloted a group songwriting music 
therapy intervention for patients with long-term depres -
sion and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of both 
the intervention and of conducting a larger randomised 
controlled trial. Descriptive information on health ser -
vice use was collected to inform a future health economic 
evaluation.
(a) Feasibility and acceptability of research methodology
The overall research methodology was feasible and 
acceptable. Recruitment was most successful in second -
ary care community mental health teams and via self-
referrals from patient and public groups. Success may 
be due to the research team’s familiarity recruiting in 
such services or potentially due to a higher threshold of 
symptom severity held by these services. Our approaches 
through GP practices were by letter only and it remains 
to be seen if recruitment could have been more successful 
if researchers were available during clinic time to speak 
to those who express interest to their GP . Similarly, there 
was limited success in recruiting from Talking Therapy 
services, possibly due to lower symptom thresholds and 
recent receipt of talking therapy. Instances of unblind -
ing were due to participants contacting researchers post-
randomisation. Provision of a different contact telephone 
number post-randomisation might help to manage com -
munications and maintain blinding.
In terms of clinical outcomes, there were differences 
between observer and self-reported measures of depres -
sion. Whilst participants did not report large changes 
between assessments, both blinded researchers and cli -
nicians who were interviewed, reported wider observed 
changes. This may be due to the chronicity of symptoms 
experienced by participants making it challenging to 
notice change (for example, the BDI-II asks for changes 
in the last 2 weeks) [87]. We would therefore propose the 
MADRS as a suitable measure for the primary outcome 
of a future trial alongside secondary measures of psycho -
logical distress, quality of life and life skills.
Outcomes suggest a promising effect on the reduction 
of depression and improved social adjustment. How -
ever, these improvements were not seen until 3 months 
post-intervention, suggesting this as the point at which 
greatest improvement might be seen. Eight treatment 
participants and four wait-list participants scored worse 
for their depression symptoms at post-intervention. 
There are two possible explanations. One is that for 
treatment participants, the ending of an intense social 
experience was challenging and therefore measures 
picked up low mood for treatment participants at this 
endpoint. Further preparation, signposting and support of participants for their “next steps” might help to ame -
liorate this. Alternatively, the worsening of symptoms 
might be attributed to the time of year the measures were 
taken as this occurred at the post-intervention follow-
up which took place towards the end of January [88, 89]. 
Finally, symptom improvements at the post-intervention 
follow-up in three wait-list arm participants may also 
capture their expectancy as they awaited to start their 
own groups [90], or they might capture spontaneous 
improvement.
(b) Feasibility and acceptability of intervention
Whilst overall elements of the intervention appeared 
feasible, a number of areas require modification prior 
to any further testing. Attendance was poor in treat -
ment groups, but slightly better for the wait-list group. A 
number of factors may help to explain this: Non-attend -
ing participants tended to either have (a) low symptom 
severity scores (< 15 on the MADRS), (b) were recruited 
from Talking Therapies and commenced employment or 
(c) felt there was too much going on to be able to commit 
to attendance. Childcare, housing and multiple appoint -
ment demands were the main reasons cited for being 
unable to commit. There was also a difference between 
morning and afternoon groups. Participants were given 
the option to choose which time they would prefer, and 
noticeably, those with more severe depression scores 
chose the later time in the afternoon.
The group frequency of 3 times per week was not fea -
sible for this client group, hindered also for many by the 
group location. Participants suggested that twice per 
week would be more manageable in end interviews. Chal -
lenges in attendance are known for this patient popula -
tion [91] and a number of participants faced significant 
issues with complex life situations including homeless -
ness, care responsibilities and safeguarding. Modifying 
the session duration and frequency might also mitigate 
the challenges faced at the end of treatment by partici -
pants and potentially improve outcomes at post-inter -
vention. Whilst the intervention included signposting of 
participants to wider community arts and social opportu -
nities at the end of treatment, few participants attended 
these final sessions. It may therefore be important to 
arrange individual follow-up meetings post-intervention 
to review therapy progress and explore next steps.
Process measures identified important elements of the 
group culture that may impact upon outcomes. The rela -
tionship satisfaction scale in particular gave a good indi -
cation of group cohesion and moments of conflict within 
the group. It may be that greater time was required in one 
group for the music therapists to foster trust and build a 
therapeutic relationship [9] prior to commencing the task 
Page 26 of 30 Carr et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:75 
of writing songs. It is known that early group cohesion is 
a predictor of later outcomes [92, 93], thus these meas -
ures will be useful in explaining outcomes.
The music therapists commented on the lack of control 
regarding group composition, resulting in groups with 
large differences in levels of musicianship and also groups 
where participants were already familiar with each other 
through other services. Neither of these variables were 
considered in the trial, yet both critical mass and homo -
geneity of musical preferences are important factors in 
therapeutic group songwriting [94, 95]. In a larger ran -
domised controlled trial, it would be challenging to 
curate group composition post-randomisation as this 
would rely on sufficient recruitment up-front and may 
result in long delays between consent and commence -
ment of the intervention. This poses a risk of attrition 
and potentially long waits for those who have enrolled 
onto the study as well as resource challenges in delivering 
a larger number of groups all together, rather than a more 
staggered approach [96].
This study encountered issues in the music therapists’ 
use of recording software as part of the intervention. 
Modifications to the intervention include more sup -
port for music therapists on editing and recording songs 
within sessions and further skills training in the tech -
nology. Participants suggested longer sessions of up to 
2 hours would be beneficial to allow for these processes. 
The adherence form also requires re-design to capture 
adherence to core group principles without relying upon 
a linear group process.
 (iii) Assessment of service use
This was relatively simple to ascertain from partici -
pants although further patient and public involvement 
will be important to ensure benefits and related health 
economic questions are relevant and up to date.
Consideration of intervention attendance 
and study withdrawals
This study had a high number of withdrawals (N = 12, 
40%), most having occurred by the point of 1  week 
post-intervention. It was notable that all bar one of the 
non-attending participants in the treatment arm (N = 5) 
chose to withdraw from the study despite encourage -
ment to continue with assessments. For these partici -
pants, elements of housing, caring and life made the 
thought of further participation too difficult. For the one 
participant who did not withdraw, contact was lost and 
the research team were unable to complete any of the 
follow-up assessments with this person. All other with -
drawals were with participants who attended fewer than 
ten sessions. Further examination of the factors prevent -
ing group attendance is therefore important prior to conducting a future trial. Group attendance is known to 
be a challenge for this patient group [90] and strategies 
to address this include ensuring full information about 
the intervention, offering assessment or trial sessions and 
curating the location and time to be as accessible as pos -
sible. Further qualitative exploration with participants 
for example, regarding barriers such as housing, appoint -
ments and childcare, may help to identify exactly how 
and when group music therapy may be appropriate and 
accessible. Further stratification of patient characteristics 
may be useful in a larger trial [97]. For example, stricter 
eligibility criteria on depression severity (e.g. a cut-off  
score of 20 on the MADRS) may help to avoid recruiting 
those with minimal depression scores who attend fewer 
sessions and it may also help to identify those who will 
struggle to attend due to a greater severity of symptoms 
and associated life factors. Recruitment may be most suc -
cessful from secondary care mental health services and 
this may also aid retention. Similarly, it will be important 
to balance randomisation on core characteristics of age, 
gender, duration of depression and symptom severity.
Limitations
The study is limited by necessarily small numbers; hence, 
all outcomes are descriptive only and may not be rep -
resentative of any true effect. The loss of follow-up data 
from those participants who withdrew and may not 
have benefitted from the intervention may similarly have 
impacted the outcomes reported. However, three out of 
four participants who withdrew from the intervention 
due to negative experiences or feeling there was not ben -
efit still took part in assessments and were included in 
the outcome data. Recruitment was from one NHS site 
in East London and therefore findings may be limited in 
their generalisability to other settings.
Conclusion
Based on the study feasibility criteria, a randomised 
controlled trial of songwriting in group music therapy 
is feasible and acceptable but further developments and 
modifications—especially to the intervention and, also, 
the trial design—are required.
In terms of study design, recruitment should focus 
on community mental health teams, and link to patient 
and public forums. A recruitment rate of 4 patients per 
week can be expected, but time should be factored in 
to allow a slower recruitment rate at the start. Inclu -
sion criteria should include screening for depression 
severity prior to informed consent. Randomisation 
should stratify for age, gender and duration of depres -
sion and include an active control to minimise any 
expectancy effect of treatment. Outcomes immediately

 Carr et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2023) 9:75 
 
post-intervention may be influenced by the treatment 
ending with benefits potentially detected at 3 months.
Regarding the intervention, further piloting is 
required to refine the intervention and to determine the 
primary endpoint. Further intervention development 
is required to promote greater attendance and group 
cohesion. Introductory meetings, group location and 
transportation should be considered carefully. Groups 
should be less frequent with a longer course (e.g. 2 per 
week over 6  months) and require a critical mass of at 
least 4 members. More time is required to prepare for 
ending and after-care procedures.
