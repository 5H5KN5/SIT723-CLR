Abstract
Background: Very premature birth (gestational age between 28 and 31 + 6 weeks) is associated with increased risk
of cognitive delay and attention deficit disorder, which have been linked to anomalies in the development of
executive functions (EFs) and their precursors. In particular, very preterm (VP) infants display anomalies in
controlling attention and gathering task-relevant information. Early interventions that support attention control may
be pivotal in providing a secure base for VP children ’s later attainments. The Attention Control Training (ACT) is a
cognitive training intervention that targets infants ’abilities to select visual information according to varying task
demands but had not been tested in VP infants. We conducted a feasibility study to test the processes we intend
to use in a trial delivering the ACT to VP infants.
Methods and design: We tested recruitment and retention of VP infants and their families in a randomised trial, as
well as acceptability and completion of baseline and outcome measures. To evaluate these aims, we used
descriptive quantitative statistics and qualitative methods to analyse feedback from infants ’caregivers. We also
investigated the quality of eye-tracking data collected and indicators of infants ’engagement in the training, using
descriptive statistics.

Results: Twelve VP infants were recruited, and 10 (83%) completed the study. Participants ’parents had high
education attainment. The rate of completion of baseline and outcome measures was optimal. VP infants
demonstrated engagement in the training, completing on average 84 min of training over three visits, and
displaying improved performance during this training. Eye-tracking data quality was moderate, but this did not
interfere with infants ’engagement in the training.
Discussion: The results suggest the ACT can be delivered to VP infants. However, challenges remain in recruitment
of numerous and diverse samples. We discuss strategies to overcome these challenges informed by results of this
study.

Key messages regarding feasibility
/C15The feasibility of delivering a cognitive training
programme, the Attention Control Training (ACT),
to infants born very preterm (28 to < 32 gestational
weeks) may be hindered by challenges inherent in
recruiting this hard-to-reach population, as well as
challenges related to the vulnerability of this popula-
tion to health, cognitive and behavioural difficulties.
/C15The findings indicate that recruitment of very
preterm infants and their families in the ACT
programme presents key challenges, which also
involve recruitment of families from diverse
backgrounds. Nonetheless, retention was adequate
and procedures such as randomisation and
assessment batteries were acceptable. Notably, the
findings indicate that very preterm infants engaged
adequately with the programme.
/C15These findings indicate that recruitment strategies
could benefit from involvement of gatekeepers, and
strategies to build trusting relationships between
researchers and participants. Infants ’engagement
with the training programme suggests it may be
possible to increase the number of training visits.
Background
Advances in obstetric care since the 1990s, particularly
the use of antenatal corticosteroids and surfactants, have
contributed to the increasing survival and improved
health of children born premature [ 9,10]. However,
even with these developments, premature children are
still at increased risk for intellectual deficits [ 17,49,71]
and poorer school attainment [ 2]. These risks may cur-
tail the longer-term wellbeing of the increasing number
of premature children who survive.
Infants born between 28 and less than 32 weeks gesta-
tion age and known as very premature (VP) are atincreased risk of significant intellectual deficits [ 8,17,
32,34,39,46,60], learning difficulties [ 1,38], attention
problems [ 1,27,66], problem behaviours [ 5,14,22,42],
and developmental disorders such as attention deficit
with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [ 15,16,29,30,47].
Moiseev and colleagues suggested that increased risks
for delays in behaviour regulation, cognitive and intellec-
tual abilities experienced by VP infants may be linked to
disruption of pre- and frontal-cortex maturation caused
by very premature birth [ 43]. However, longitudinal
studies suggest that maturation issues alone cannot
explain the long-term delays of children born VP. In
fact, increasing evidence suggests that VP delays may
result from cumulative deficits that start accruing from
an early age. In particular, VP infants display marked
problems in directing, allocating and inhibiting attention
in order to complete experimental tasks [ 25,66], and
findings published by Rose and colleagues suggest that
in the first year of life VP infants display inefficient and
more immature patterns of attention in tasks that
require effortful processing of stimuli [ 56–58]. Collect-
ively, these findings suggest that VP infants display diffi-
culties in attention control —that is, the ability to select
actively what to pay attention to and what to ignore. At-
tention control is considered a key precursor of execu-
tive functions (EFs) [ 3,33], which are top-down
cognitive processes that regulate other cognitive process
(e.g. selection of task-relevant information) in order to
fulfil a goal [ 23,24]. EFs play a key role in cognitive
development, as well as the development of behaviour
regulation. Thus, early appearing anomalies in attention
control may initiate a cascade of effects, such as poorer
EFs, ultimately leading to cognitive deficits [ 36,37,41,
54,55].
The developmental perspective outlined highlights the
importance of early interventions that target foundational
attention control skills. Cognitive training programmes
that allow infants and young children to practise keyPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 2 of 23
components of their emerging cognitive abilities can suc-
ceed by capitalising on the plasticity of neural networks
controlling key cognitive skills, and the fact that anomalies
or deficits are not yet entrenched [ 13,75]. A systematic re-
view and meta-analysis of cognitive training programmes
supports the hypothesis of an augmented effect at younger
ages of delivery [ 78].
A promising cognitive training tailored for infants is
the Attention Control Training (ACT) [ 6,74]. This
training programme involves showing on a screen
cartoon-like characters that move and change in re-
sponse to infants ’direction of gaze. This is possible
thanks to an eye-tracking device that feeds information
in real-time to a computer, which in turn generates
adaptive visual displays. The computer programme capi-
talises on infants ’interest for visual and auditory stimuli
and engages infants in game-like situations, whereby dis-
playing a specific behaviour triggers a ‘reward ’stimulus,
e.g. an animated character appearing and making a
funny noise. Commonly, the games involve rewarding
infants for learning to control their gaze away from a
more salient ( ‘automatically ’attention-eliciting) area of
the screen, in favour of using their endogenous (volun-
tary) attention control to orient towards a less salient
area. In a different task set, infants have to scan a series
of colourful targets on the screen in order to detect a
pre-specified target object, which triggers the reward
animation. In this way, the programme can challenge in-
fants in using attention in flexible and increasingly so-
phisticated ways to obtain the reward animation.
Previous studies involving typically developing infants
suggest effectiveness and generalisability of the ACT
programme, at least in the short term [ 6,28,74,76].
These findings suggest that VP infants may take advan-
tage of this intervention, which could support the emer-
ging development of attention control abilities that are
particularly challenged in this population and are pivotal
for the development of Executive Functions. Evidence
shows that attention control training programmes can ef-
fectively improve abilities in this domain, producing trans-
fer of effects that is more pronounced when these abilities
are targeted at a younger age [ 75]. Furthermore, a recent
meta-analysis indicates that effects of computerised train-
ing programmes may be larger in developmentally at-risk
groups, who may be more susceptible to training that tar-
gets key abilities [ 61]. Since VP infants may be generally
more susceptible to environmental influences [ 62], it is
possible they may benefit particularly from early interven-
tions that address abilities at the basis of later attainment,
such as attention control.
However, the implementation of the ACT with VP
infants necessitates testing some of the underlying pro-
cesses to be used in a randomised trial. VP infants repre-
sent a small population: in high-income countries, VPbirths account for approximately 1% of all births [ 21],
and 0.8% of all births in England and Wales were VP in
2018 ([ 48], 2019). Furthermore, VP infants are at risk of
health problems and complications [ 7], and VP birth is
also associated with increased likelihood of parents ’
mental health issues [ 20,69,70]. Furthermore, VP births
are more prevalent among households in deprived areas
[11,63]. These characteristics make families of VP in-
fants a hard-to-reach population. We thus aimed to
study and resolve challenges in recruiting and retaining
a sample of VP infants. Furthermore, VP infants may be
more likely to display a difficult temperament [ 40] and
poorer ability to sustain attention [ 53], which may hin-
der their ability to engage with the ACT tasks and other
types of lab-based assessments.
Differences in temperament, irritability and fidgetiness
may also affect the quality of eye-tracking data collected
from this population: abrupt head movements and
changes in posture can hinder the correct identification
of the pupil and the head position, on which eye-
tracking data rely. Although the ACT training is not af-
fected by quality of the eye-tracking data [ 6], lower qual-
ity of eye-tracking data can affect results of eye-tracking
outcome tasks, introducing biases that can inflate differ-
ences in performance [ 77]. Since VP infants may be
more fidgety and restless than typically developing in-
fants, comparisons in tasks that rely on eye-tracking data
must ensure that the quality of data collected is compar-
able across groups.
Aims of the study
There are different intervention programmes that aim to
improve cognitive abilities of preterm infants [ 64], but
few target exclusively the infants and their abilities. Fur-
thermore, to the best of our knowledge, computerised
training programmes have been tested with ex-preterm
children [ 4,72], but not with ex-preterm infants and
toddlers. Finally, few studies have used eye-tracking
methods to examine preterm infants ’attention abilities
[25,35,59,67]. Our overarching aim was thus to test
the feasibility of delivering the computerised ACT to VP
infants. In particular, our objectives were to test (a) the
recruitment process; (b) retention in the programme; (c)
number and duration of VP infants ’completed training/
control sessions and VP infants ’engagement in the
programme; (d) acceptability and completion of baseline
and outcome assessments; (e) quality of eye-tracking
data collected and (f) feedback from parents regarding
obstacles and facilitators to study participation.
The a priori criteria set for determining success of
feasibility (see [ 50]) were (1) recruitment of 20 VP
infants in the study; (b) retention of 80% of the sample,
defined as in point dbelow; (c) infants retained in the
study to complete at least two training or control weeklyPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 3 of 23
visits, defined as attending at least two tasks for 240 s
and (d) infants retained in the study to complete at least
50% of the pre- and post-test tasks.
To control for preterm infants ’maturation, we consid-
ered VP infants ’corrected age, i.e. their age adjusted for
total age since conception. Using corrected age ensures
that premature infants are compared to term infants that
are at similar developmental and maturational stages.
Methods
Trial design
The study followed the protocol described in a previous
publication [ 50] and involved a feasibility randomised
trial whereby eligible infants were allocated with 1:1
ratio to either the Attention Control Training (ACT) or
a control procedure. Families and infants in both arms
of the study were invited to take part in five sessions for
five consecutive weeks, matching the protocol used in
previous studies [ 6,73]. Researchers attempted to sched-
ule the first session around the time the infant was 12
months (corrected age). The first session involved a
baseline assessment of attention and cognitive skills
carried out by a blinded assessor (see ‘Blinding ’). If the
infant was in a calm and alert state at the end of the
baseline assessment, the experimenters attempted to de-
liver the training or control programme within this first
visit. If the infant was not calm or alert, or the parents
did not agree to stay for the training/control procedure,
the first training or control visit was scheduled for the
following weekly session.
In weeks 2, 3 and 4 of the study, the infant partici-
pated in the training or control procedure, according to
their random group allocation. In week 5, infants com-
pleted the same battery of tasks delivered during the
baseline assessment. The baseline and post-test assess-
ments were delivered by a post-graduate student,
dubbed in the reminder of this manuscript as the asses-
sor, who was blind to infants ’group allocation. Another
experimenter (from now on the experimenter ) was
responsible for delivering the training or control proced-
ure and was instructed not to divulge this information to
the assessor (see ‘Randomisation ’for more details).
The study protocol initially stipulated to run all the
study sessions in a dedicated room in the premises of
the local collaborating charity. However, after initial
feedback from parents enrolled in the study and discus-
sion within the study steering group, we changed the
protocol to allow parents to opt to conduct the training
or control sessions in their own house. The goal was to
facilitate participation of parents who might have had
difficulties travelling to attend the weekly sessions with
their child. To ensure that training or control sessions
were comparable when delivered in different settings,
the same set-up was used ( see‘Interventions ’). Wedevised a questionnaire to collect feedback concerning
parents ’experience of the study. Following suggestions
by the study steering group, parents were also asked to
take part in a short telephone interview to provide more
detailed feedback. Consent to take part in the study did
not imply consent for this interview (see ‘Ethical
approval ’).
In order to incentivise participation, we offered fam-
ilies compensation for travel expenses incurred in at-
tending the study sessions (at 0.40 GBP per mile).
Furthermore, families of infants that completed the
study were offered gift vouchers for a value of 60 GBP.
These incentives had been agreed in consultation with
the charity to compensate for potential child-caring
costs.
A steering group that included practitioners working
in neonatal services and a parent representative, as well
as the study group, met approximately every 2 months
to monitor progress of the study. These meetings
commenced before recruitment started and ended when
the study was concluded and a report for the funders
produced.
Participants
Eligibility criteria were infants born very preterm (gesta-
tional age 28 to less than 32 weeks), residing in Northern
Ireland, age 12 months (± 1 month) at the time of first
scheduled appointment and corrected for prematurity.
Exclusion criteria were infants with significant visual
and/or hearing difficulties, congenital anomalies that
impacted on cognitive and sensory-motor development,
or participation in other trials that could affect infants ’
attention and cognitive skills. These criteria excluded,
for instance, children with Down syndrome or suspected
cerebral palsy: the rationale was to recruit a group of VP
infants with relatively homogeneous sensory-motor and
cognitive skills.
Eligible participants were identified by two categories
of gatekeepers: (a) collaborating neonatology practi-
tioners in hospitals within the Belfast, South Eastern,
and Northern Trust in Northern Ireland; (b) a local
charity for families of premature children. We organised
preliminary individual meetings between the principal
investigator (OP) and practitioners to illustrate the
rationale and procedures of the study and discuss ways
to present the study to parents of eligible infants. Similar
group meetings with charity workers were also carried
out, followed by discussions. The gatekeepers ensured
that parents or caregivers of eligible infants received in-
formation about the study. Parents or caregivers inter-
ested in the study had to contact the research team in
order to receive more details and decide whether to take
part. While participants who received information
through practitioners were known not to meet exclusionPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 4 of 23
criteria, families approached by the local charity were
asked to have a consultation with one of the collaborat-
ing practitioners to ensure their child did not meet any
exclusion criterion. Parents who agreed for their child to
take part provided written consent before starting the
study.
Interventions
Infants in the ACT intervention watched interactive car-
toons on a computer screen connected to an eye-tracker
which recorded the infant ’s eye movements: the com-
puter ran a software that produced the animations on
the screen (see ‘Equipment and material ’). We used
three type of tasks that trained key abilities such as the
following: search for a target among distracters (three
games —‘Stars ’,‘Usual Suspects ’and ‘Disengagement ’);
short-term memory of objects embedded in scenes
(‘Puzzle Memory ’,‘Windows ’,‘Tausendfuss ’and ‘Three
Little Maids ’); maintaining a goal ( ‘Butterfly ’and
‘FlyMe ’). Further details on these tasks are provided in
the published protocol [ 50] and the Supplementary
Material .
The types of tasks presented were spread across the
three categories and delivered according to a compu-
terised random order. The experimenter was instructed
to present each game for at least 240 s without interrup-
tions. Training games could be interrupted if the child
became sleepy or irritable: games were interrupted when
infants failed to engage with the game for a continuous
period of over 30 s. A web camera mounted above the
screen displaying the cartoons recorded the infant ’s face:
this was used in order to check quality of data produced
and to complement potential loss of data.
The control procedure prescribed presenting cartoons
in the same way as in the ‘Interventions ’and with the
same equipment. The key difference was the type of
presentation on the screen: in the control procedure,
these were not interactive and thus did not change con-
tingently with infants ’gaze direction. To ensure presen-
tations were similar in length and characteristics to
those in the intervention group, infants in the control
group were matched infant-by-infant and visit-by-visit
with participants in the ACT training. Thus, the car-
toons displayed to a control child were the same ones
produced by the corresponding matched child in the
intervention group: The pivotal difference was that the
display was generated according to a pre-set schedule
for those in the control group.
Infants watched the training or control games while
sitting on the parent ’s lap, approximately 40 cm from the
screen. The screen, the parent and the infant were inside
a cubic photo light tent to avoid visual distractions and
sudden changes in light.The experimenter introduced the training tasks to par-
ents describing them as ‘games ’and stating the aim was
for infants to play the games for as long as possible. The
experimenter also explained that the eye-tracker had a
limited ‘head box ’, i.e. an area within which the devise
can detect the infant ’s eyes: parents were asked to try to
keep the baby ’s head within this headbox. The experi-
menter told parents they should try to re-engage their
child ’s attention in the direction of the screen if she
turned away, but to do so by using non-descriptive
phrases such as ‘look’. Otherwise, parents were encour-
aged not to talk or to do anything that could distract the
child while the games were running. The experimenter
was instructed to monitor the parent and infant ’s behav-
iour through the web camera, and if necessary remind
parents about these instructions.
The training and the control sessions could take place
in a dedicated room in the charity ’s premises, or at the
parents ’home, according to parent ’s preferences. When
conducting the sessions in the family ’s home, researchers
asked for collaboration in minimising any other potential
source of distraction, e.g. loud or sudden noises. To
monitor differences in conditions across settings, a coder
(author MJ) reviewed the recordings of the visits, rating
the presence of noise and light interference in a Likert-
type scale (from no interference tomajor interference )
and the infant ’s state (drowsy, calm and alert, mild pro-
test, distressed or crying). The main author reviewed a
sample of these sessions (30%) to check inter-rater reli-
ability, obtaining adequate indices (Cohen ’sκ> .75 for
all categories).
Equipment and material
The games were presented on a standard 19 ”4:3 com-
puter screen. Stimuli presentations were controlled by
an Apple MacBook Retina running Matlab scripts, oper-
ating via Psychtoolbox/GStreamer and the Tobii SDK. A
Tobii X-60 eye-tracker mounted at the bottom of the
screen fed information to the laptop, after an initial cali-
bration sequence. Matlab also recorded the eye-tracker
gaze data.
Outcomes
(a)Recruitment : Recruitment was defined as the
percentage of the eligible families approached who
agreed to take part in the study and were
randomised.
(b) Retention: This was the percentage of randomised
participants for whom data were available at
baseline and post-test.
(c) Number, percentage and duration of training/
control sessions attended and completed by infants.Perra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 5 of 23
(d) We also assessed changes in performance of trained
infants during the training: improved performance
would indicate infants were engaging with the
training and gaining proficiency.
(e) Percentage and type of tasks for which data are
available at pre- and post-test.
(f) Quality of eye-tracker data collected during baseline
and post-test assessments, such as the number of
usable fragments and the degree of consistency in
the reported position of gaze between recorded
samples (see ‘Statistical analysis ’).
We also collected feedback from participating parents
using a short questionnaire and a semi-structured inter-
view. In the latter, parents were asked about difficulties
and obstacles in taking part and remaining in the study,
as well as their motivations in taking part and their ex-
perience of the study.
Baseline and post-test assessments
We used a battery of tests to gather information about
the infants ’general cognitive and motor development,
their attention and their social cognition abilities. The
presentation of tasks took place in four pseudo-
randomised sequences, counterbalanced between infants
and across baseline and post-test within each infant. At
baseline, parents also completed a questionnaire to col-
lect socio-demographic information about them (e.g.
educational attainment) and their child (e.g. birth
weight). We describe these tasks to illustrate thecommitment required by infants and families and their
ability to complete these, the main aim of this study.
Further analyses of task-specific results will be presented
in another paper.
Setting of baseline and post-test assessments
The battery of tasks took place in a dedicated room in
the premise of the participating charity. The room had
no windows and contained the photo light tent used for
the eye-tracking attention tasks, as well as a desk and
two chairs where all the tasks not requiring eye-tracking
data were delivered. Two CCTV cameras were placed at
opposite angles around the desk in order to obtain a
simultaneous recording of the infant and the parent, and
the assessor. In most of the desk-based tasks, the asses-
sor sat on one side, and the infant sat on the parent ’s
lap, opposite the assessor.
General cognitive and sensory-motor development
We administered the Mullen Scales of Early Learning [ 44].
These provide scores on different domains of infants ’devel-
opment (e.g. expressive language; fine motor abilities), in-
cluding norms. Results at baseline are reported in Table 1.
Computer-based measures of attention
We delivered widely used measures of sustained atten-
tion, visual recognition memory, disengagement and in-
formation processing. These took place inside the
photographer tent, while the infant sat on the parent ’s

lap in front of a computer screen. The tasks are
described in the study protocol [ 50].
Naturalistic attention tasks
We used the Orientation Task from the Lab-Tab
[31,51], as well as a semi-structured interaction
between parent and infant. In the latter, four age-
appropriate attractive toys were placed in front of
the infant and the parent sat across the table. Par-
ents were instructed to play with the infant as they
‘would normally at home ’for 4 min.
Social attention and cognition
We administered the Gaze Following, Object Spectacle
and Book Presentation tasks from the Early Social
Communication Scales (ESCS) [ 45]. These provide infor-
mation on the infant ’s ability to share attention with
other people and her communicative abilities.
Temperament
Information on some temperamental traits is provided
by the Orientation Task mentioned among the naturalis-
tic attention tasks. We also administered the Attractive
Toy Placed in a Box task from the Lab-Tab [ 31,51]. The
latter provides measures relating to behaviour regulation.
Furthermore, parents were also asked to complete the
very-short form of the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire
(IBQ) [ 52].
Sample size
The intended sample size for the study had been deter-
mined using a confidence interval approach to power
calculation [ 19]: our aim was to recruit 20 infants.
Randomisation
Sequence generation
The random allocation sequence was created in two
blocks ( n= 10 each) using randomly generated numbers
from the uniform distribution. These were generated
using Stata 13 [ 65] and constraining the intervention/
control ratio to be 1:1.
Allocation concealment mechanism
The experimenter responsible for delivering of the inter-
vention/control received the allocation in a sealed
opaque envelope when a new participant was due to
commence testing. The experimenter opened the enve-
lope only when the child finished the baseline assess-
ment and was instructed not to disclose allocation to the
assessor responsible for delivery of the post-test.
Implementation
The sequence generation was produced by the first
author and project PI. Participants were enrolled by theexperimenter, who did not administer the baseline and
post-test outcome measures, but during these tasks
attended to the recording cameras.
Blinding
To ensure blinding, the assessor did not contribute to
administration of the training/control procedures, nor
were they involved in data analyses concerning training
and control procedures. We informed parents that we
were not going to tell them in which group their child
had been allocated. Parents were thus intended to
remain blind to group allocation. Since the parents were
present during the training or control sessions, they
might identify whether the games were part of the train-
ing (i.e. they were interactive displays), or the control
procedure (i.e. games were not interactive). Our experi-
ence suggested it was unlikely parents recognised the in-
fant’s group allocation since infants in both conditions
react to the displays with signs of interest, due the
attention-grabbing nature of the stimuli (e.g. moving
high-contrast stimuli). Furthermore, parents could not
see the eyes of their infant while the infant was on their
lap, and therefore, it might have been difficult for them
to assess if the cartoons were responding contingently to
the infant ’s eye direction. However, at the end of the
study, we asked parents to indicate whether they thought
they had recognised to which study arm the child had
been allocated, and in which study arm they thought
their child was.
Ethical approval
The study had been reviewed and approved by the
Health and Social Care Research Ethics Committee A
(HSC REC A), REC reference: 18/NI/0010; IRAS project
ID: 37537. The original protocol was changed to allow
researchers to ask parents to take part in a phone inter-
view at the end of the study and relate their experience
of participating in it. Parents who agreed to take part in
this interview expressed their informed consent recorded
before commencing the interview. The protocol was also
changed to allow families to opt to carry out the inter-
vention or control procedure in their own home.
Statistical analysis
Recruitment and retention
We used descriptive statistics to indicate the number
and proportion of participants recruited relative to eli-
gible and approached individuals, and the absolute and
relative numbers of participants retained and their
characteristics.
Duration and completion of training and control session
The duration of training and control sessions was re-
ported in minutes. Descriptive statistics were used toPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 7 of 23
report the average number and duration of training or
control tasks by sessions, as well as cumulatively across
the study. Further analyses indicated the number and
duration of training tasks by type of tasks (goal mainten-
ance, target search, short-term memory).
Performance during training tasks
Performance indicators varied according to tasks ’
demands and criteria (see Supplementary Material ).
Performance indicators were standardised into Zscores
to ease comparisons across tasks. We then collated indi-
vidual participants ’Z scores across tasks of the same
type (goal maintenance, target search, short-term mem-
ory) in each training visit: thus, each infant contributed
several performance measurements during each visit.
We used multilevel growth regression models to test if
trained infants displayed linear changes in performance
across visits: linear effects would indicate significant per-
formance improvement across tasks. In these analyses,
the units of observations were the Zscores registered
across visits, which were considered nested within in-
fants. The models allowed to estimate the initial status
(average Zscores in the first visit) and the rate of change
(the average change in performance Zscores from one
visit to another), as well as residual variances around
these parameters (see Supplementary Material ). Multi-
level growth models allow to control for inter-individual
differences and can also control for the fact that partici-
pants contribute different number of observations:
multilevel models are thus ideally suited for analyses of
our data.
Completion of pre- and post-test assessment tasks
We used descriptive statistics to report on the number
of pre- and post-assessment tasks completed by group.
Quality of eye-tracking data
The quality of eye-tracking data recorded was assessed
in the gap-overlap task of all participants at pre- and
post-test. We chose this task because, in our experience,
it is generally the most attractive to infants and they
tend to engage in this task more than others. Thus, the
task provides a meaningful sample of the eye-tracker
data quality; insofar, the recording should be less
affected by infants ’losing interest and disengaging from
the task.
Following methods described by Wass et al. [ 77], we
calculated two indices: precision of tracking, and flicker ,
which is an indicator of the robustness of the recording.
Precision of tracking indicated variability in the degree
to which the position of gaze was consistent between
recorded samples. Increased variability in the recording
of the position of gaze from one gaze sample to the next
would indicate increased sampling error and a ‘noisiersignal ’. Thus, more precise recordings are characterised
by lower degree of variation in position of gaze reported.
Flicker was defined as the duration in seconds of
usable fragments of eye-tracking data during the task re-
cording. The loss of usable fragments during a recording
can be caused by unavailability of any of the elements
the eye-tracker uses to assess gaze direction (e.g. when
infants turn away from the screen). Thus, a longer dur-
ation indicated more robust recordings.
These two indicators of data quality are important in-
sofar as lower-quality data can lead to unwarranted con-
clusions when comparing performance of different
groups (e.g. typically vs. at-risk infants): for example,
worse quality of data can bias reaction times to appear
shorter (see [ 77]). To gauge the quality of data obtained
from our sample of VP infants, we compared the values
of Precision and Flicker with the values obtained in the
study by Ballieux et al. [ 6] and the study by Wass et al.
[74]. Both these studies involved typically developing in-
fants born at term, but Ballieux et al. conducted their as-
sessments in a setting more akin to that used in this
study (a day centre), while Wass et al. conducted their
assessments in a laboratory.
Qualitative outcomes
Follow-up semi-structured interviews with parents that
had taken part in the study were conducted on the
phone by the first author, who followed an interview
schedule. These were transcribed verbatim and analysed
using thematic analysis to identify common themes re-
lated by participating parents. These analyses were con-
ducted by a researcher not involved in the project who
independently identified themes. The first author
reviewed the transcripts to ascertain validity of
interpretation.
Results
Recruitment
The recruitment phase encompassed 13 months from
April 2018 to April 2019. Results are reported using the
CONSORT flow diagram (Fig. 1). Overall, of all the
families eligible and contacted by the gatekeepers, 27
recorded their interest for the study by contacting the
research group: a large proportion of these thus failed to
register their interest in the study after receiving infor-
mation through the gatekeepers. Seven of these families
had twins, thus representing 34 eligible participants that
expressed interest in the study. Out of these, 11 families
agreed to take part (41% of those who recorded their
interest). These accounted for 12 infants being rando-
mised to take part in the study, as one family had twins.
Information on infants and their families was available
for 11 infants who attended the first session with their
families. The primary caregiver of infants who took partPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 8 of 23
in the study was the biological mother. The highest edu-
cational attainment for most of them (73%) was a uni-
versity degree. Furthermore, 7 mothers reported
attainment of A-levels, and 8 reported attainment of
GSCEs, which are the minimal educational attainments
expected in the UK. Overall, participating families had
parents with higher educational attainments than aver-
age. Families whereby mothers were in full-time employ-
ment also had partners in full-time employment: onlyone family reported both parents were not in paid em-
ployment. Parents ’and infants ’characteristics are
reported in Table 1.
Retention
Out of the 12 infants randomised in the study, 10 (83%)
were retained (see Fig. 1). These 10 completed the tasks
in the baseline and post-test assessments (see section on
‘Completion of pre- and post-test assessment tasks ’, for
Fig. 1 CONSORT diagramPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 9 of 23
more details). One infant, who had been randomised to
the intervention, did not attend the baseline assessment
and our attempts to reschedule other appointments were
unsuccessful. Another infant completed the baseline as-
sessment and was randomised to the control group but
did not attend the visits afterwards. The 10 infants that
completed the study were evenly split between the inter-
vention and control groups.
In Fig. 2, we report the corrected age (CA) in months
when infants attended the pre- and post-test sessions:
these are calculated based on infant ’s gestation age and
expected date of birth reported by parents. The average
age at pre-test was 11.90 months CA ( SD= 0.79) and
13.04 months CA ( SD= 1.21) for the intervention and
control groups respectively. The average age at post-test
was 12.95 months CA (SD = 0.78) and 14.43 months CA
(SD = 1.01) for the intervention and control group re-
spectively. The families of two infants in the control
group agreed to take part in the study and had sched-
uled an appointment to take place by the time the in-
fants were 12 months CA, but because of family
commitments were only able to attend the pre-test as-
sessment when aged over 13 months CA. Family com-
mitments also caused delays in completing the post-test
of ID 4 (control group), who was approximately 12months CA at pre-test and was over 14 months CA
when completing the post-test. Since differences in age
and maturation have an impact on attention control,
these differences across participants and across groups
must be taken into account: in future data analyses, we
will have to either control for age effects or exclude par-
ticipants tested outside the range of 12 months (± 1
month). Overall, results indicate some difficulties in
scheduling appointments within the intended age range
of our study.
Number, duration and characteristics of training/control
sessions completed
All infants in the training and the control group
attended the visits scheduled in weeks 2 to 4 of the pro-
cedure. Furthermore, two infants in the intervention
group and one in the control group also started their
training/control procedure on week 1, after they com-
pleted the pre-test assessments. Thus, the 10 partici-
pants cumulatively completed 33 visits, comprising 17
intervention and 16 control completed visits respectively.
Overall, 2 out of 17 intervention visits, and 6 out of the
16 control sessions had been completed at the partici-
pants ’home: only one infant in the intervention group
received the training at home (and only for 2 out of 3

sessions), and two infants in the control group com-
pleted the control procedure at home.
Participants in the intervention group completed 4.65
games per session (SD = 1.62), see Table 2. For partici-
pants in the intervention group, a game was deemed
completed if the infant engaged in it for at least 240 s: in
previous studies using the ACT, this had been identified
as an adequate length of engagement with training
games. The average percentage of games completed was
73.16% (SD = 26.63). The average duration of completed
games per visit in the intervention group was 24.59 min
(SD = 9.39). Participants in the intervention group cu-
mulatively completed 83.60 min of training games per
child, with a range between 65.95 and 104.05 min.
The cumulative training time of 84 min was remark-
ably similar to the 77 min of cumulative training time
displayed by typically developing infants in the study by
Wass and colleagues [ 74], which prescribed the same
number of training/control sessions as our study. Infants
in the intervention group completed an average of 25
min of training (respectively 5, 25, 27, and 30 min from
the first visit following pre-test to the last visit): these
times were also very similar to those reported in another
study involving typically developing infants [ 6] who on
average completed 10, 21, 19, and 25 min of training
from the first to the last visit, respectively.
The average duration of the games displayed to partic-
ipants in the control group was 23.46 min (SD = 8.88).
Overall, the five participants in the control group
attended 75.07 min of games per child, with a range
between 61.41 and 87.88 min. The procedure of display-
ing to controls the training sessions of a matched trained
infant should have enabled identical duration of sessions
for the control group: instead, the results indicated a
relatively shorter cumulative duration of the control
sessions. This can be partly explained by the contingent
fact that one control child completed only a few minutesof the procedure in week 1 (as reflected by lower average
duration for the controls in week 1, see Table 2). How-
ever, the average duration of training and control
sessions was similar (24.59 and 23.46 min respectively).
The two training visits delivered at home to one par-
ticipant had an average duration of 26.99 min (SD =
2.72), which compared favourably with the average dura-
tions of training visits in the lab across participants
(mean = 24.27 min; SD = 9.96). Across control partici-
pants, the average duration of the visits at home and in
the lab was 21.61 min (SD = 10.04) and 24.57 min (SD =
8.47) respectively.
The median duration of each training game presented
to the intervention group are reported in Fig. 3a: these
summarise durations of completed and attempted pre-
sentations for each game. Despite some variability (e.g.
the duration of the goal maintenance task #2, due
partly to some technical prob lems with this task), all
the median durations were above the 240 s threshold.
Figure 3b presents the median duration of the com-
pleted games (i.e. those lasting at least 240 s): overall,
participants displayed adequate durations of engage-
ment across all the tasks. In Table 3,w ea l s or e p o r tt h e
cumulative number and duration of completed games
by type of games. Participants engaged for adequate
amount of times with all types of tasks. It is notable
that every child across the study completed at least
three tasks within each of these categories, indicating
that they received training of all the three abilities
targeted.
The training or control visits delivered in the home
setting were overall rated to take place in adequate con-
ditions. Approximately 2% of the tasks delivered at the
participants ’home were considered to take place while
some acoustic distraction was present and when abrupt
changes in light took place, which might have interfered
with the task delivery. In approximately 89% of the tasks,

Performance during training
In Fig. 4, we report standardised ( Z) performance
scores across the three types of tasks delivered, while
details about the model parameters and results are re-
ported in the Supplementary Material . A multilevel
growth model indicated that infants displayed a rele-
vant linear increase in performance in the goal main-
tenance task, rate of change coefficient 0.41 ( 95% CI
0.23 to 0.59; z= 4.50). Infants also displayed a linear
increase in Target Search performance across visits,
rate of change coefficient 0.40 ( 95% CI 0.04 to 0.76; z= 2.20). Finally, multilevel regression indicated a mar-
ginal linear increase in short-term memory perform-
ance across visits, rate of change coefficient 0.12 ( 95%
CI−0.01 to 0.25; z= 1.79). Overall, these results in-
dicated that infants improved performance across
training visits, suggesting adequate engagement with
the training.
Percentage and type of tasks for which data are available
at pre- and post-test
The completion of the test battery devised took between
42 and 99 min to complete, with an average of 66.62 min
(SD= 16.51). All the participants that attended the pre-
test sessions in the intervention and control groups ( n=

tention tasks; all those that attended the post-test in the
intervention and control group ( n= 5 in both groups)
completed the screen-based attention tasks.
We also recorded good rates of completion of social
attention and cognition tasks from the ESCS, as re-
ported in Table 4. Overall, all the tasks were com-
pleted by participants from both groups who attended
the pre-test. Only one participant in the intervention
group failed to complete both the Gaze Followingand the Object Spectacle tas ks during the post-test
because of tiredness. While non-completion of these
tasks because of tiredness may signal obstacles that
may be experienced by other participants, it should
be taken into account that this participant was from a
couple of twins enrolled and being tested on the
same day: The participant was randomly chosen to be
tested after the other twin, therefore remaining in the
premises where we conducted testing for longer, com-
pared to other participants.

All participants who attended the pre- and post-test
completed the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, as well
as the as well as the naturalistic attention tasks: the Lab-
Tab Orienting task and the semi-structured parent-
infant interaction, although the latter had not been re-
corded at post-test for one child from the control group
because of an error using the recording equipment. All
infants that attended the experimental sessions also
completed the Lab-Tab Frustration task, and the IBQ
questionnaires were returned by parents for all infants at
pre- and post-test, save for the parents of an infant in
the control group that did not return the questionnaire
at post-test. Overall, the results indicate that the battery
of tasks we administered was feasible.
Quality of eye-tracker data collected during baseline and
post-test assessments
We used two indicators recorded during the pre- and
post-test gap-overlap task: variability in Precision and
Flicker. The Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) of the
variability in Precision obtained from 21 completed gap-
overlap tasks at pre- and post-test was 6.2e −03 s ( SD =
.6e−03 s, range 3.0e −03 s to 13.9e −0.3 s). This was a rela-
tively higher value compared to similar studies that re-
ported SEM = 4.0e−03 s and SD = .2e −03 s [ 6] and SEM
=3.2e−03 s and SD = .1e −03 s [ 74] respectively, indicat-
ing less precise tracking overall.
Flicker was indexed by values indicating continuous
recording, whereby higher values indicate fewer in-
stances of information loss. The SEM of Flicker recorded
across 21 completed tasks in our sample was 1.51 s ( SD
=0.24 s; range 0.47 to 4.88 s). The SEM of this indicator
was lower compared to that obtained in other similar
studies: SEM =2.0 s and SD =.18 s [ 6]; SEM =3.7 s and
SD =.18 s [ 74], respectively, indicating less robust
tracking.
Feedback from parents
End-of-study questionnaire
Seven parents completed the end-of-study questionnaire,
accounting for 8 participating infants (5 of whom allo-
cated to the intervention). In Table 5, we report sum-
mary statistics of parents ’answers: scores ranged from 5
(strongly agree) to 1 (strongly disagree), so that higher
scores indicate agreement with the question statement.
Parents generally agreed that the information pro-
vided and the communication by the research team
was clear, were convinced about the importance of
the study, and would recommend taking part to other
parents. In Fig. 5, we report a more detailed break-
down of the questions that concerned obstacles in
study participation and the infants ’perceived experi-
ence. These results indicate some parents across the
two groups found the study sessions too long, and allparents generally agreed that infants were tired at the
end of these sessions. However, only one parent indi-
cated taking part was demanding. Nonetheless, all
parents who replied agreed their infants had enjoyed
taking part in the study.
Results also indicated that parents generally accepted
the process of randomisation: the need for random allo-
cation was explained in the information sheet and par-
ents required to agree to this process. Furthermore,
parents did not express the desire to know in which
group had been allocated, see Table 5. Finally, parents
correctly identified the group allocation of their child in
4 out of 8 instances.
Semi-structured interviews
Five parents from five different households of infants
who took part in the study were available to conduct an
interview at the end of the study. Three of these had in-
fants who had been allocated to the intervention, and
two completed the study before the option of home
visits had been offered. The themes identified are sum-
marised in Table 6.
The first topic concerned the decision to take part in
the study. Our analyses identified some ‘proximal ’fac-
tors that concerned their relationship with the gate-
keepers who approached the family in the first instance.
All respondents emphasised trust and a sense of grati-
tude towards the gatekeeper. For example:
‘It was because of the consultant ringing, because
we have a relationship with him, and he was very
very good with [baby]. ’[Father participant ID 14,
intervention group].
‘It was just what I could do to give back really: we
had got quite a bit of support from TinyLife, so be-
cause it was through them, we were like: Oh yeah,
will give it a go. ’[Mother participant ID 11, control
group].
Parents also discussed other more general, ‘distal ’fac-
tors as important in their decision to take part. These in-
cluded the desire to potentially help families and
preterm infants by contributing to research, as well as
interest in learning more about infants ’cognitive
development.
Respondents discussed a series of factors that facil-
itated their and their child ’s participation in the
study. Some were ‘extrinsic ’insofar they involved re-
search staff behaviour and contextual factors, such
as the study schedule. All respondents appreciated
researchers being approach able and providing flexi-
bility in scheduling appoin tments and valued the op-
portunity to run the training/control games in theirPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 14 of 23

own home. Some parents also commented positively
on the study schedule, for example:
‘T h ef a c ti tw a so n l yo n c eaw e e kw o r k e dw e l l
because I have a busy schedule anyway with the
baby so, but I think if it was more than once a
week it, you know, would be hard to fit into our
schedule. ’[Mother participant ID 60, interven-
tion group].
Other factors that facilita ted participation in the
s t u d yw e r ec o n s i d e r e dt ob e ‘intrinsic ’,i . e .t h e y
concerned the fact that infants engaged and enjoyed
some of the tasks, and the satisfaction of being able
to observe baby ’s progress across time. For
example:‘[…] Just even for my own benefit to see that [baby]
was progressing and, you know, learning as the
weeks went on, and by the end of it was able to do
stuff he couldn ’t at the beginning. Haha, you know,
that was probably the best part of it for us, seeing
the progress. ’[Mother participant ID 11, control
group].
Respondents reported a series of difficulties in partici-
pating to the study. Parents commented on the chal-
lenges of fitting study attendance with infants ’routines
(e.g. meal and sleep times), and they also commented on
the challenges related to travel to attend study visits
while accommodating infants ’feeding and sleep patterns.
Some also commented on difficulties related to infants ’
mood being ‘unpredictable ’, and the challenges provided
Fig. 5 Parent ’s responses to questions on obstacles to participation by group allocationPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 16 of 23
by attempting to maintain infants ’concentration for the
length of the study games and tasks.
Finally, parents mentioned some potential incentives
and facilitators to the study procedure. One parent
(infant ID 14) suggested the possibility of providing light
meals and refreshments to facilitate participation of fam-
ilies, particularly if testing took place outside of normal
working hours. Other issues concerned the potential
benefit of providing some physical activity for infants
before they were expected to sit in front of the screen
during the testing/control games (Parent of infant ID
60). One parent also emphasised the importance of pro-
viding a testing environment that was safe from dangers
of infection that may derive, for example, from infants
sharing the same toy. Finally, some comments con-
cerned the provision of more detailed information con-
cerning the length of the testing/control games:
‘If there was some way for the parent to have an
idea of how each clip was going to run for. Because
obviously we ’re trying to sit and hold them in place,
it would be good to know how long they ’re going to
last and when it ’s going to end. ’[Father participant
ID 14, intervention group].
Discussion
We conducted a study to investigate the feasibility of de-
livering a computerised cognitive training intervention,
the Attention Control Training (ACT), to infants born
very preterm. Our overarching aim was to test the pro-
cesses to be used in a randomised trial, including re-
cruitment, retention, treatment adherence and
acceptability of the outcome measures. We had set apriori criteria for assessing feasibility (see ‘Background ’)
that were mostly met. In particular, (a) we had aimed to
recruit 20 VP infants within a year, but managed to re-
cruit 12, thus failing to meet this criterion; (b) we con-
sidered successful retention if 80% of recruited infants
completed the study: 10 out 12 (83%) did so according
to the criteria set (see point dbelow); (c) we considered
success in the procedure if infants retained completed at
least two tasks for 240 s on at least two weekly session:
the 10 infants retained in this study met this criterion
(see Table 2and‘Results ’section); (d) we considered the
battery of pre- and post-test assessments feasible if
retained infants completed at least 50% of these tasks: all
10 infants retained met and exceeded this criterion (see
Table 4and‘Results ’section). The results therefore indi-
cate the study is feasible overall, but also emphasise key
challenges in recruitment. In what follows, we will map
our results onto the study questions.
Recruitment
The results indicate that while it is possible to recruit
families of very preterm infants, there are challenges that
still need to be addressed. We had aimed to recruit 20
infants, but recruited 12 infants from 11 households.
Furthermore, most participants came from households
where the main caregiver reported higher than average
educational attainments. Improving recruitment rates
would also necessitate recruiting families with diverse
backgrounds.
VP infants and their families represent a relatively
small and hard-to-reach population. Vulnerability to
health problems and differences in temperament and at-
tention, which are evident from an early age, may hinderTable 6 Themes and sub-themes identified by the thematic analysis of interviews with parents of infants who took part in the study

VP infants ’participation in cognitive training pro-
grammes like the ACT. Furthermore, parents may also
be affected by a VP birth by displaying increased con-
cerns, anxiety and mental health issues [ 69]. Recruitment
should thus be tailored to take into account these issues.
Our recruitment process relied on two types of gate-
keeper to inform eligible participants about the study:
practitioners known to the family, and a dedicated char-
ity. The findings of the qualitative analyses of partici-
pants ’feedback suggest that this strategy was effective:
parents reported that one of the drivers in their decision
to take part in the study was trust and their personal re-
lationship with the gatekeeper. Furthermore, charity
workers promoted the study, a strategy that has proven
successful in involving ‘hard-to-reach ’populations [ 12].
The relatively high proportion of participants who
failed to register interest in the study (see Fig. 1) can be
explained by our protocol, which prescribed that contact
between the research team and eligible participants had
to be initiated by eligible participants: despite expressing
interest in the study when contacted by the gatekeepers,
many eligible participants did not contact the re-
searchers. Indeed, the recruitment protocol of this study
may have been too complicated, thus hindering partici-
pation: in particular, parents firstly agreed to receive an
information package by the gatekeeper; they then had to
read the information, and successively phone the re-
search team on at least one occasion to register their
interest and ask for more information. All these steps
may have discouraged parents, particularly those less fa-
miliar with research and more preoccupied by other pri-
orities of daily living. Practitioners who contributed to
the Study Steering Group highlighted that the procedure
‘prevented families from backgrounds with lower levels
of education and literacy to make contact with the re-
search team ’(Minutes 6thMeeting, Study Steering
Group, Aug 16 2019). Based on the findings from this
study and our experience from other studies, we advo-
cate a different strategy that would involve a contact
from the research group, provided the family consent to
receive information about the study.
However, even within families that registered their
interest in the study, only 41% eventually agreed to take
part in the study. The steering committee discussed this
issue (e.g. Minutes of Steering Group meeting Sep 14
2018) whereby some obstacles to recruitment were iden-
tified in the following: (a) a study schedule that may
have appeared too strict and demanding for parents; (b)
the use of specialised and technical language in describ-
ing the study to parents. A series of action points were
agreed that included the following: emphasising flexibil-
ity around the study schedule (e.g. possibility to skip a
weekly session if parents were on holiday); increasing re-
searchers ’flexibility by allowing evening and weekendappointments; changes in the script used by researchers
to describe the study to interested parents, and particu-
larly reduced use of technical terms, as well as emphasis
on the novelty of the study.
We did not promote this study through media or mar-
keting campaigns, and we made very limited use of so-
cial media: The study was only promoted through the
social media of the charity involved. However, media
and social-media promotion and public information
campaigns may be useful, particularly in addressing bar-
riers relating to lack of familiarity with research and low
health literacy [ 12,68]. Further improvements to the re-
cruitment strategy may involve communication with
families. In developing social-media promotion with the
charity, we discussed the opportunity to use terminology
that promotes trusting relationships (e.g. substituting the
term ‘study ’with less intimidating ones, see [ 26]).
We attempted to incentivise participants by reimburs-
ing parents for travel expenses when they attended lab
visits and giving gift vouchers at the end of the study.
The latter incentive was meant to cover potential costs
of child care (e.g. in looking after participants ’siblings).
However, none of the parents who took part in the study
described this as an incentive, while some mentioned
difficulties in arranging child care as one of the difficul-
ties in taking part. Alternative strategies to support
child-care arrangements and its costs may be important
in promoting participation. A final consideration con-
cerns the effectiveness of appealing to participants ’altru-
ism: many participants mentioned their desire to
contribute to research that may benefit families and in-
fants ’like their own in the future, a finding that is con-
sistent with other research with hard-to-reach
populations [ 12].
In conclusion, the results suggest the feasibility of
recruiting this population, but indicate the need to re-
view the recruitment process by improving opportunities
for contact and building trusting relationships with the
research team, including reduced use of specialist and
complex language, and information campaigns using dif-
ferent media. Further ways to minimise practical obsta-
cles (e.g. child-care arrangements) would also be
important. In reviewing the recruitment strategy, it will
be pivotal to involve and incentivise co-production with
third-sector bodies and parents from the communities.
Retention
Although we recruited a small sample, retention ap-
peared satisfactory: only two infants who had been ran-
domised (17%) did not complete the study. The results
however indicate some difficulties in testing infants
within the narrow 1-month window at 12 months: two
infants started the study when they were past age 13Perra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 18 of 23
months (see Fig. 2), due to family engagements that pre-
vented attendance of testing sessions at an earlier age.
Parents who completed the study mentioned chal-
lenges that involved the difficulty of making time to at-
tend the study sessions: Some of these challenges
concerned ensuring infants attended the sessions in their
best condition, i.e. well rested and fed. Other challenges
concerned obstacles related to daily life demands, par-
ticularly work commitments and arrangement of child
care.
Some of these obstacles to retention had been mit-
igated by delivering the training/control games in
the participants ’home: after this option became
available, three out of four families recruited in the
study opted for delivery o f the procedure at home.
Only one family declined this option, citing they
lived closely to the charity premises where the study
was delivered. Feedback from parents emphasised
the convenience of avoiding travelling to a lab, hav-
ing infant ’s food and resting facilities at hand, and
conducting the study in an environment familiar to
the infant. Comparisons between home and lab ses-
sion are undermined by the fact that only three par-
ticipants had the programme delivered at home, but
so far, these suggest that most of the sessions at
home were conducted in adequate conditions with-
out significant distractions and interferences, and the
infants were mostly seen in an alert and calm state.
Feedback from parents also emphasised the import-
ance of the researchers being flexible and responsive
in scheduling study sessions, a factor that other
studies indicate facilitate retention of hard-to-reach
populations [ 12]. Feedback from parents indicated
that potential facilitators of retention may involve
providing more precise information about duration
of tasks in advance, breaks that involve infants ’phys-
ical activity, as well as refreshments, and provision
of a safe testing environment whereby risks for in-
fections are minimised, an aspect that may be par-
ticularly salient following the COVID-19 pandemic.
The intervention required relatively long sessions sit-
ting in front of a screen for young infants and all parents
that provided feedback reported their child being tired
at the end of these sessions. However, parents also re-
ported their child enjoyed the programme. This
programme had been developed to be child-friendly, but
it had never been trialled with VP infants before: Our re-
sults indicate that while the intervention purposely chal-
lenges VP infants ’abilities, parents appreciate their VP
children ’s engagement with the programme, and some
parents also reported their gratification in noticing
changes in their child ’s performance over time.
To summarise, the results indicate that it is pos-
sible to retain families of VP infants using thecurrent design. Key facilitators are flexibility and re-
sponsiveness to changing situation by the research
team, and the possibility to have the training
programme delivered in the family ’s house. However,
implementing this intervention in the future may
benefit from increasing the duration of training time:
it will thus be pivotal to be able to mitigate obsta-
cles relating to daily life aspects (e.g. parental work
commitments).
Do infants engage with the training or control games?
One of the key questions in testing the feasibility of
the ACT with VP infants was whether these infants
would engage in the programme adequately. The re-
sults of our study indicate a positive answer to this
question.
Firstly, infants in both the intervention and control
group engaged in the games presented for an ad-
equate number of visits an da m o u n to ft i m e .A l li n -
fants across the two groups completed at least three
training or control visits, as we intended. On aver-
age, infants in the intervention group accumulated
approximately 84 min of tr aining, while infants in
the control group watched the non-interactive dis-
plays for 75 min in total, on average. The training
time in this study was remarkably similar to the
training time accumulated by typically developing in-
fants in previous studies that prescribed the same
study schedule as our study [ 6,74]. Notably, every
infant in the training group had accumulated at least
66 min of training time. Furthermore, across the
study, all infants in the intervention group com-
pleted at least three games from each of the categor-
ies we had devised (search for a target among
distracters, short-term memory, goal maintenance),
demonstrating they had received an adequate
amount of training across these domains of attention
control (see also Table 4). A consideration for future
studies is the short time and small number of infants
that completed the training or control games after
the pre-test assessment (see Table 2): since the re-
sults suggest completing th is training/control session
was challenging, it may be reasonable to only deliver
it when infants have had the time to rest.
Another key index of engagement was trained infants ’
performance during training. The results (see Fig. 4) in-
dicated that trained infants generally improved their per-
formance across training visits, indicating that they were
progressing and increasingly mastering these tasks.
In conclusion, the results indicate VP infants in this
study engaged in the ACT games: The training time ac-
cumulated by VP infants was consistent with that re-
ported in other studies involving typically developing
infants of the same age [ 6,73]; VP infants increased theirPerra et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:66 Page 19 of 23
performance during training, an indication they were ad-
equately engaging with the training material.
Acceptability of study processes: randomisation, baseline
and outcome assessments
Another aim of this study was to test processes we in-
tend to use in a larger trial. The results indicated that
randomisation was acceptable: the rationale for random-
isation was explained before parents agreed their child
to take part, and feedback received from parents indi-
cated they appreciated this rationale, as well as the fact
that their child ’s allocation was not disclosed at the end
of their participation (see Table 5).
This study also investigated how feasible and
acceptable was the battery of pre- and post-test we had
devised. This battery included several measures of atten-
tion and general development, and its delivery lasted
over an hour on average. Despite the length and the na-
ture of the testing battery, whereby tasks challenged in-
fants ’socio-cognitive skills, all the VP infants that
attended the pre- and post-sessions completed most of
the tasks. Indeed, only one infant in the intervention
group did not complete two tasks (both tasks from the
ESCS). Feedback from parents did not indicate the
length and the nature of these assessments to be
problematic.
Quality of eye-tracking measures
Eye-tracking is a research technology that affords several
advantages when applied to the study of gaze behaviour,
such as high temporal and spatial resolution, and the au-
tomated processing of large amount of data that can be
readily used in analyses. This technology has also been
adopted in the study of infants ’behaviour and cognition,
but some methodological challenges remain and have
been relatively less investigated [ 77].
The recording of a participant ’s gaze direction relies
on correct detection of a series of variable (e.g. the pupil
position), which can be disrupted by infants being
fidgety and abruptly changing their head and eye pos-
ition. In assessing the quality of data collected among
our sample of VP infants, we focused on two indicators:
precision and robustness. Our results suggested moder-
ate quality of eye-tracking data among VP infants.
However, this issue is unlikely to have significantly
interfered with the training and its effectiveness,
s i n c et r a i n i n gt a s k sa r en o ts e n s i t i v et od a t aq u a l i t y
[6]. Furthermore, results reported in previous sec-
tions indicate that VP infants ’training times were
very similar to those of typically developing infants,
and indices of performance also followed consistent
patterns that indicated infants ’improvement, hence
engagement with the tasks. Were the training tasks
significantly affected by lower quality of eye-trackingrecordings, we would have expected infants ’engage-
ment to follow more haphazard patterns.
Nonetheless, the results of moderate quality of eye-
tracking data suggest that future studies comparing perform-
ance of VP and typically develo ping infants in eye-tracking
tasks (e.g. habituation tasks) need to monitor and report the
quality of the data collected. Lower quality of data collected
among VP infants may bias the results, inflating group differ-
ences when VP infants are compared to typically developing
infants in eye-tracking task outcomes [ 77]. Studies that plan
to compare performance of VP infants with other groups
might have to mitigate factors that can reduce quality of data
such as infants ’fidgetiness, for example by ensuring infants
are tested when in a calm and alert state.
Limitations of the study
Our results are limited by the small number of partici-
pants, and their homogeneity: most of the VP infants in
the study came from higher socio-economic status
households, at least according to the educational attain-
ment of the main caregiver. Parents and caregivers from
different backgrounds may face more and diverse chal-
lenges in taking part in a similar intervention. It will also
be important to further investigate the engagement with
the ACT intervention of VP infants from different back-
grounds, who may differ in temperament and reactivity
from an early age [ 18].
Conclusions
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study
that attempts to deliver a cognitive training
programme to VP infants. Our results suggest the
feasibility of delivering the ACT intervention to VP
infants when they are approximately 1 year of age
from their due date. However, the results also indi-
cate challenges in recruiting sizeable and diverse
samples, which will have to be addressed in future
studies. To mitigate these challenges, the study indi-
cated some processes that were successful in recruit-
ment (e.g. trusting relationships with gatekeepers;
appeal to participants ’altruism) and in retention
(e.g. flexibility in scheduling visits; delivery of the
training at home). The results indicate that VP in-
fants engaged successfully with the training, accumu-
lating adequate total training times for their age and
improving performance across training visits.
