Abstract
Background: Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are disproportionately burdened by premature mortality. This
disparity is exacerbated by poor continuity of care with the health system. The Veterans Health Administration (VA)
developed Re-Engage, an effective population-based outreach program to identify veterans with SMI lost to care and
to reconnect them with VA services. However, such programs often encounter barriers getting implemented into
routine care. Adaptive designs are needed when the implementation intervention requires augmentation within sites
that do not initially respond to an initial implementation intervention. This protocol describes the methods used in an
adaptive implementation design study that aims to compare the effectiveness of a standard implementation strategy
(Replicating Effective Programs, or REP) with REP enhanced with External Facilitation (enhanced REP) to promote the
uptake of Re-Engage.
Methods/Design: This study employs a four-phase, two-arm, longitudinal, clustered randomized trial design. VA sites
(n = 158) across the United States with a designated Re-Engage provider, at least one Veteran with SMI lost to care, and
who received standard REP during a six-month run-in phase. Subsequently, 88 sites with inadequate
uptake were stratified at the cluster level by geographic region (n = 4) and VA regional service network (n = 20) and
randomized to REP (n = 49) vs. enhanced REP (n = 39) in phase two. The primary outcome was the percentage of
veterans on each facility outreach list documented on an electronic web registry. The intervention was at the site and
network level and consisted of standard REP versus REP enhanced by external phone facilitation consults. At 12 months,
enhanced REP sites returned to standard REP and 36 sites with inadequate participation received enhanced REP for six
months in phase three. Secondary implementation outcomes included the percentage of veterans contacted directly
by site providers and the percentage re-engaged in VA health services.

Discussion: Adaptive implementation designs consisting of a sequence of decision rules that are tailored based on a
site’s uptake of an effective program may produce more relevant, rapid, and generalizable results by more quickly
validating or rejecting new implementation strategies, thus enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of
implementation research and potentially leading to the rollout of more cost-efficient implementation strategies.

Background
Persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI), e.g., bipolar
disorder or schizophrenia, experience a disproportionate
burden in morbidity and premature mortality from com-
mon medical conditions includ ing cardiovascular diseases
and certain cancers [1-3]. These physical health disparities
may be exacerbated by long gaps in care from the health-
care system due to psychiatric symptoms or access barriers
such as lack of transportation, insurance, or relationship
with a primary care provider [4,5]. Many evidence-based
practices help to mitigate these risks when this population
remains engaged in care [6].
Continuity and coordination of care for vulnerable health
populations with chronic conditions such as SMI are key
components of the Chronic Ca re Model [7,8]. The Chronic
Care Model is a population- and measurement-based
approach that calls for healthcare organizations to use
electronic registries to monitor vulnerable populations
and to adjust treatment according to patient response.
Not only has this model of care been successful in man-
aging mental health across various healthcare settings
[9,10], a number of large health care providers including the
Veterans Health Administration (VA) have demonstrated
that this model of care is effective for re-engaging persons
with SMI who had been lost to care to prevent adverse
health effects [11-13].
Despite the promise of the Chronic Care Model and
similar population management programs, they are rarely
routinely implemented in practice [14,15]. Several reasons
that contribute to this resear ch-to-practice gap have been
described elsewhere [16] and include system and provider-
level barriers to program uptake.
Identifying effective implementation interventions that
address system and provider barriers can speed program
uptake in routine practice. Impl ementation interventions are
operationalized techniques ba s e do na nu n d e r l y i n gf r a m e -
work or theory that are designed to enhance the uptake of
effective programs across diffe rent healthcare settings [17].
Implementation interventions address multilevel barriers to
program adoption, such as organi zational culture, leadership
buy-in, and provider training and capacity [16,18-24] to
ultimately enhance program uptake [25].
Studies involving implementation intervention strategies
have been referred to as type III hybrid-effectivenessimplementation studies [17], where the intervention is the
implementation strategy and the primary outcomes are fo-
cused on program uptake rather than testing the effective-
ness of the program itself on patient outcomes.
A handful of type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation
studies based on underlying implementation frameworks
[26-30] have been recently c onducted [17,31-34]. These
studies involved highly specified implementation interven-
tion strategies such as Replicating Effective Programs,
Facilitation, or Evidence-based Quality Improvement
that address multiple organizational and provider barriers
[17,32,34]. These studies typically randomized sites to re-
ceive a new implementation strategy or standard dissem-
ination to enhance the uptake of an effective program.
Most of these studies take place in highly organized sites
or treatment settings such as the VA.
Applying traditional randomized trial designs to complex
implementation interventions can be challenging because
they require several sites to achieve adequate power, and
involve monitoring of both program and implementation
intervention fidelity. Hence, these designs may not accom-
modate lower resourced sites that are less willing to be
randomized or participate in study assessments [35] —the
very sites implementation interventions are designed to
assist. Moreover, not all sites may require the same level
of implementation intervention, and some may require
additional assistance due to underlying barriers to pro-
gram adoption that are not apparent or measurable at
baseline. This can lead to less cost-efficient use of imple-
mentation resources such as provider training, technical
assistance, and the time require to build relationships with
leaders and frontline providers across sites. In many situa-
tions, it is also unclear how long an implementation inter-
vention is needed to improve program uptake [36,37].
In response to these challenges, we describe a new
approach to implementation interventions. Increasingly
used in clinical research, adaptive interventions guide the
decisions to augment (change or adapt) existing interven-
tions given signs of non-response (or other intermediate
outcomes) during treatment [38-41]. When applied to im-
plementation intervention studies, adaptive interventions
allow sites that are not responding to an initial implemen-
tation strategy to receive an augmented implementation
intervention. In contrast to simply measuring correlates ofKilbourne et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:136 Page 2 of 14
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/8/1/136
implementation non-response across sites, studies of adap-
tive implementation interven tions can help to determine
the added value of a more intensive implementationintervention strategy and how long the more intensive
implementation strategy should be continued to achieve
improved program uptake at individual sites.
Aims and objectives
The aim of this study is to use an adaptive implementa-tion design to compare the effectiveness of an enhanced
versus standard version of an implementation strategy
(Replicating Effective Programs, or REP) to promote theuptake of a population management program for patients
with serious mental illness who have dropped out of care
(‘Re-Engage ’). REP is a previously operationalized im-
plementation strategy that has been shown to improve
the uptake of effective Chronic Care Model and related
programs [28,31,42] and consists of program manualdissemination, training, and brief technical assistance.
Enhanced REP includes standard REP with facilitation,
which involves proactive coaching by a program expert thatis focused on enhancing pr ovider buy-in and uptake.
The primary implementation outcome is the uptake
of the Re-Engage program, defined as the percentage ofveterans ’with an updated documentation of their clinical
status within 12 months, which is a central component of
Re-Engage population management. The primary hy-pothesis is that among facilities not initially responding
to standard REP , the addition o f facilitation (enhanced REP)
will be associated with increased percentages of docu-mented updates to veterans ’clinical status. Secondary
outcomes include facilities ’percentage of veterans who
were provided brief care management, defined as per-centage contacted or percentage returning to VA care.
Additionally, we seek to explore whether among facilities
t h a ti n i t i a l l yd i dn o tr e s p o n dt os t a n d a r dR E Pt h ei m -mediate addition of facilitation (enhanced REP) is asso-
ciated with better outcomes t han receiving Facilitation
after a six-month delay.
Methods
Described previously [5,11,13,43-48] Re-Engage is a VAnationally mandated brief care management program for
veterans with serious mental illness [48]. At the time of
protocol submission, the tria l intervention had already
started and collection of outcomes had begun. This study
was reviewed and approved by the local VA Institutional
Review Boards and was registered as a clinical trial(Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN21059161).
Trial design
This study employed a four-phase, two-arm, longitudinal,
clustered randomized trial design (see CONSORT diagram-
Figure 1). The four phases, described below, are: run-in,phase one, phase two, and follow-up (Figure 2). The unit
of intervention in this study is the site. All VA sites in the
50 United States (N = 158) within the VA ’s2 1r e g i o n a l
networks that were required as part of the VA National
Directive [48] to implement Re-Engage and had at least
one veteran with serious mental illness who had droppedout of care were included and received standard REP in the
run-in phase of the trial.
The six-month run-in phase included standard REP
components, and at the end of the run-in phase, sites
not responding to standard REP were identified. Phase one
involved randomization to two site-level implementationinterventions: Enhanced REP (adding Facilitation) or
continuation of standard REP technical assistance on an
as-needed basis. Phase two involved offering sites who wererandomized to standard REP in phase one the enhanced
REP facilitation, and discontinuing facilitation among sites
who received facilitation in phase one.
Run-in phase
During the initial run-in phase (1 March 2012 to 31 August2012), all eligible VA sites nationally received standard REP
to implement the Re-Engage program. As in the original
study [11], providers implementing Re-Engage were askedto identify and document their pa tients' current disposition
based on a pre-generated list of those who had dropped out
of care, as well to attempt to contact them and invite themback to VA health services. The initial run-in phase began
when the requirement to implement the program was com-
municated to sites in March 2012 and continued until 31August 2012 [48]. During this phase, the designated mental
health provider was identified at each eligible facility, and
he or she received a computerized list of patients who haddropped out of care and a website link to track their status,
a package describing the Re-Engage program, training, and
brief technical assistance.
Phase one
Sites with inadequate implementation of Re-Engage(i.e., non-responding sites) as of 1 September 2012 were
then identified based on a previously established eligibility
criterion and randomized to receive enhanced REP orcontinued REP. Inadequate implementation of Re-Engage
was defined as documenting and attempting to contact
less than 80% of patients on the drop-out list, based ona review of the website registry from each site. This
previously established measure is considered a core
component of the Re-Engage program because it is anindicator of whether the provider reviewed the list and
attempted to find the patient. This measure was used
to benchmark implementation response because thismeasure is most likely to be impacted by individual
providers. A cut-point of 80% was selected because it is
a standard definition used to determine adequate adherenceKilbourne et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:136 Page 3 of 14

to practice guidelines based on the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality [49].
Sites having successfully implemented Re-Engage by
the end of the run-in phase (31 August 2012) continued
to receive standard REP for phases one, two, and the
follow-up phase of the trial (Figure 2).
Sites that had not adequately implemented Re-Engage as
of the end of the run-in phase ( i.e., non-responding sites)
were stratified by geographic region and 1:1 randomizedby the sites ’VA regional network (n = 20) to enhanced or
continued standard REP. Because each VA regional network
has mental health leaders that communicate across sites,randomization was conducted at the VA regional networklevel to minimize potential for contamination. Non-
responding sites randomized to receive enhanced REP
received six months of facilitation and those randomizedto standard REP received technical assistance calls only if
they requested it for six months during phase one.
Phase two
After the end of phase one (28 February 2013), sitesoriginally randomized to receive standard REP and who
were still non-responsive (<8 0% documentation of patients ’
clinical status) received enhanced REP facilitation. Sites that
were initially randomized to receive standard REP and met

receiving enhanced REP during phase one received stand-ard REP in phase two regardless of responsiveness.
Follow-up phase
After the end of phase two of the study (31 August, 2013),
standard REP will continue and outcomes including VA
use [50] will be monitored through 31 August 2014 usingpreviously established methods [51,52].
Participants
This implementation trial is being conducted at the VA
facility-level between January 2012 and August 2013. A
VA facility was eligible for the current trial if it wasincluded in the national VA Re-Engage program. VA
facilities were included in the national Re-Engage program
if they were within the 50 United States or Puerto Rico,were required, per VA policy [53], to have a mental
health provider who filled the role of a Local Recovery
Coordinator, and had at least one veteran with seriousmental illness who was lost to care —i.e., had been seen
at the facility in fiscal year (FY) 2008 or FY 2009, but had
no subsequent outpatient visits or an inpatient stay of lessthan two days as of January 2012. There were a total of
158 facilities eligible for Re-Engage, of which 139 were
medical centers ( i.e., with hospital beds) and 19 were
community-based outpatient clinics.
Setting and target population
Re-Engage is a national VA program which has three core
components: panel management, brief care management,
and proactive outreach services that are designed tore-engage in VA healthcare veterans with serious mental
illness ( i.e., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) who pre-
viously received VA healthcare, but have not been seen
in VA healthcare for at least one year. Re-Engage was
initially developed by VA Office of Medical Inspector as aquality improvement program based on awareness that vet-
erans with serious mental illness face high rates of medical
comorbidities that require regu lar medical care [43-45], and
that gaps in healthcare services among this population con-
tribute to early mortality [5,46]. The VA Office of Medical
Inspector quality improvem ent program was completed in
2010 and found that veterans with SMI who returned to
care had lower rates of mortality (0.3%) than veterans who
were targeted for re-engagement, but did not return to care(3.9%) [11,47]. As a result, VA mandated that Re-Engage be
implemented as part of standard clinical care [48].
One provider at each VA facility, specifically the Local
Recovery Coordinator, [53], is designated to implement
Re-Engage components at his or her facility. Local Recovery
Coordinators are typically so cial workers or psychologists
who have both administrative and clinical duties [53].
Re-Engage core components were designed to be partof Local Recovery Coordinator ’s clinical duties [48], and
include the following: panel m anagement: receiving a list of
veterans with SMI whose last VA healthcare visit was attheir facility, reviewing the medical record and other infor-
mational sources to locate the veterans, updating their clin-
ical status or disposition ( e.g., vital status, whereabouts, etc.)
in a web-based clinical registry; outreach :i . e ., attempt-
ing to contact the veterans in person, via telephone,
or mail; and brief care management: completing a semi-structured assessment of veterans current health status*Non Response was defined using the as having less than 80% of Veterans on the site’s list with an updated documentation of clin ical status in the web-based

and healthcare needs and inviting veterans to return to
VA care and assisting with the scheduling of any desired
VA appointments.
As part of the Re-Engage program, the VA National
Serious Mental Illness Treatment Resource and Evaluation
Center (SMITREC) provides the Local Recovery Coordinatorat each facility with lists containing the names, last known
contact information, and last known recent clinical history
for the veterans for the Re-Engage program. Based onpreviously described proces ses [11,13], patients were
eligible for Re-Engage if they had at least one diagnosis of
schizophrenia (International Classification of Diseases,Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes
295.0 –295.4; 295.6 –295.9) or bipolar disorder (ICD-9-CM
codes 296.0 –296.8) recorded in an inpatient or outpatient
visit in FY 2008 or FY 2009; had not been seen in VA care
for at least one year ( i.e., dropped out of care: defined as no
recorded outpatient visits or an inpatient stay of less thantwo days in the FYs after their last year with any visit);
and were still alive as of March 2012 based on currently
available mortality information from the VA BeneficiaryIdentification and Records Locater Subsystem (BIRLS),
a well-established resourc ef o rV Am o r t a l i t yd a t a ,t h e
Social Security Administration Death Master File, and theNational Death Index [54].
As of March 2012, a total of 5,240 veterans were identi-
fied through Re-Engage. The average number of identifiedveterans at each facility was 33.2 (standard dev = 22.5),
with a range of 4 to 147. Of these, a subset of veterans
were targeted as high-priority for the Re-Engage program ifthey had at a history of at least one inpatient hospitalization
prior to drop out and were less than 65 years of age
(i.e., less likely to be in a nursing home or covered by
Medicare services). All high priority veterans were included
on initial lists that were diss eminated to facilities in March
2012. Additional veterans (up to a total of 42 per facility)were included on initial lists based on the dates they
were last seen in VA healthcare. Each facility ’s initial list
contained no more than 42 veterans in order to provideLocal Recovery Coordinators with a manageable number of
veterans to contact. In March 2012, contact information for
a total of 2,733 veterans was d isseminated to facilities on
the initial lists (n = 2,733, mean per facility = 17.3, std dev
6.3, range: 4 –42). Contact information for the remaining
2,507 veterans ( ‘second list ’) identified in March 2012 was
disseminated in July 2012.
Although Re-Engage is an ongoing clinical program
and over time additional veterans who have been lost-
to-care will continue to be identified and their names
disseminated to local Recovery Coordinators at eachfacility, this implementation study focused on the first
list of veterans (n = 2,733) identified and disseminated
in March 2012, and outcomes will be measured on theb a s i so ft h i sc o h o r t .Randomization
In phase two of the trial, facilities with insufficient im-plementation of Re-Engage were stratified by geographicregion and randomized at the VA integrated services
network-level to receive enhanced REP or continue receiv-
ing standard REP. We stratified by geographic regionbecause preliminary analyses indicated that uptake of
Re-Engage at the end of phase one differed by geographic
region. Randomization was conducted by the studyprogram analyst and occurred at the veterans integrated
service network-level as opposed to the facility level
because in enhanced REP External facilitation involvedcommunications with regional VA leadership and we sought
to minimize the potential for contamination across facilities
within the same integrated service network. Because the pro-viders involved in the implementation knew that they were
receiving enhanced versus stan dard REP , allocation conceal-
ment and blinded randomization were not applicable.
Implementation interventions
REP is based on the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention ’s Research-to-Practice Framework [28,29,42].
Derived from Social Learning Theory [55] and Rogers ’dif-
fusion model [56], REP consists of three central operational
components: program ‘packaging ’(i.e., translation of
treatment materials into user-friendly language), provider
training, and brief technical assistance for providers toaddress barriers to uptake. The combination of these
three components compared to package dissemination
alone resulted in improved uptake and fidelity to HIVprevention intervention programs in AIDS service or-
ganizations [42,57].
Although standard REP employs key tactical strategies
that can promote effective adoption of effective programs
[42,58], it was not designed address multilevel barriers
to implementation, such as competing demands onproviders and limited leadership support for new pro-
grams [59]. Hence, REP was enhanced by including fa-
cilitation based on the Pr omoting Action on Research
Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework
[58,60-62]. Facilitation is a systematic and iterative process
in which implementation experts promote program uptakeby working with frontline providers to identify and mitigate
barriers to program adoption [63,64].
Enhanced and standard REP implementation intervention
components [11,13] that were developed for this current
study are described previously [13]. In brief, standard REP
consists of dissemination of a Re-Engage package describingthe program ’s core components ( e.g., registry of patients
lost to care, website to document patient status), training
the mental health providers implementing Re-Engage(e.g., using the registry and website, contacting patients, and
routing them to services), and brief technical assistance
calls to the mental health providers who were to implementKilbourne et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:136 Page 6 of 14
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/8/1/136
Re-Engage (Table 1). Enhanced REP included additional
External Facilitators [65] with backgrounds in psychology
who made calls on a weekly basis to mental health pro-viders to provide specific guidance to overcoming bar-
riers to implementing Re-Engage (Table 1). Facilitators
also reached out to VA regional mental health leadersto promote the program and provided feedback on imple-
mentation progress based on monthly reports on uptake
across sites.
Outcomes
Primary implementation outcome
The primary measure of the uptake of Re-Engage was
the percentage of veterans on each facility ’s list whose
clinical status was updated in the Re-Engage web-based
clinical registry. The Veteran Clinical Status Updated
measure was calculated as the number of veterans withan update on their clinical status or disposition in the web-
based registry compared to the total number of veterans on
each facility ’s list. This outcome measure indicates whether
facilities are actively attempting to locate and contact the
veterans who have dropped out of care and is independent
of whether the veterans are reachable, and thus is a goodindicator of implementation. Consistent with recommen-
dations from previous studies of cut-points used to estab-
lish adequate adherence to clinical processes or guidelines[66,67], inadequate uptake of Re-Engage is defined as
whether an updated clinical status was available for less
than 80% of the veterans on a given facility list. Althoughthis measure is tabulated monthly for the purposes of the
VA Re-Engage program, for the purposes of this imple-
mentation study, this outcome measure was examined atthe end of the run-in period (end of August 2012), the
end of phase one (end of February 2013), the end of phase

regarding the program intervention, facility-level, regional, or national leadership.√Kilbourne et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:136 Page 7 of 14

two (end of August 2013), and during the follow-up phase
(end of February 2014, end of August 2014).
Secondary outcomes
Secondary measures of imple mentation include the per-
centage of veterans that the Local Recovery Coordinatorssuccessfully contacted among those who were on their
lists and still alive and able to be contacted ( e.g.,h a d
available address or phone number, no documentationof institutionalization or inca rceration), and the percentage
of veterans contacted who re-engaged in VA healthcare
services. These measures, percentage of veterans con-tacted and percentage of veterans Re-Engaged, reflect
the brief care management strategies that are part of
Re-Engage.
Additional secondary outcome measures include veteran-
level variables. All-cause mortality and utilization of
VA healthcare services will be compared as a functionof whether or not veterans were able to be contacted, and
if contacted, whether or not they indicated an interested
in returning to VA healthcare. Healthcare utilizationvariables will include number and length of stay of inpatient
medical and mental health hospitalizations, number of
outpatient mental health and general medical visits, andnumber of emergency department visits. Utilization of
mental healthcare will be further examined by identifying
the number of visits to recovery-oriented mental healthservices ( e.g., psychosocial rehabilitation and recovery
centers, supported employment services), as these services
are targeted to veterans with SMI [53]. Moreover, becausea large proportion of homeless veterans have a psychiatric
diagnosis [51,52], the number of visits to VA homeless
program services will be examined.
Analysis
To examine the implementa tion of Re-Engage, we will
use generalized estimati ng equations repeated mea-
sures models to examine facility-level changes in the
percentage of veterans with an updated clinical status,percentage of veterans contacted, and percentage of
veterans re-engaged over time (end of phase one, end
of phase two, end of phase three, follow-up periods),controlling for veteran-level ( i.e., percentage of veterans
on a facility ’s list with particular demographic or clinical
characteristics) and facility-level characteristics. Thecovariates section below and Table 2 contain specific
veteran-level and facility-level variables.
To examine the effects of contacting veterans and re-
engaging veterans on patient-level outcomes of mortal-
ity and healthcare utilization, we will use generalized
mixed effects models to account for VISN and facility-level covariates as well as patient-level characteristics.
We will employ logistic regression models or Poisson
models as appropriate, based on whether dependentmeasure is dichotomous ( e.g., mortality) or a count variable
(e.g., number of hospitalizations).
Sample size
Our study included all eligible VA facilities (n = 158) within
the 21 VA integrated service networks (VISNs) that had aprovider to implement Re-Engage at the time of this
study. All 158 VA facilities received standard REP in phase
one of this trial. Among these, at the end of phase one, 88facilities (55.7%) in 20 of the 21 VISNs had updated the
clinical status of less than 80% of veterans ’, indicating in-
sufficient implementation of Re-Engage. These 20 VISNs(containing 88 facilities with insufficient implementation
of Re-Engage) entered phase two of the trial and were thus
randomized (as described above) to continue standard REPor receive enhanced REP. Through randomization, nine
VISNs that included facilitie s were assigned to enhanced
REP, and the remaining 11 VISNS that included 49 facilitieswere assigned to standard REP.
Statistical power considerations
T h ed a t aa n a l y s i sp l a nf o rt h ep r i m a r ya i mi sat w o - s a m p l e
comparison of facilities within VISNs randomized to
enhanced versus standard REP. Based on the samplesizes described above, we conducted analyses to determine
whether we had adequate statistical power to detect
a significant difference in our primary (percentage ofveterans with updated clinical status) and secondary
(percentage of veterans contacted, percentage veterans
Re-Engaged) facility-level implementation outcomes
between the two groups of facilities.
At the end of phase one, the average percentage of
veterans with and updated clinical status (primaryimplementation outcome) among the 88 underperforming
facilities was 22% (SD = 25%). To account for the between-
VISN variation induced by the within-VISN correlation inthe average rate of the percentage of veterans with updated
clinical status, we inflate the variance term in the standard
sample size formula by 1 + (n-1)*ICC where ICC is theVISN interclass correlation coefficient for the average
percentage of veterans with updated clinical status. The
ICC for the average percentage of veterans with updatedclinical status among the 20 VISNs entering phase two
was 0.177. Using a two-sided, two-sample ttest based on
the sample sizes given above, a Type-I error rate of 5%, anICC = 0.177, we will have 80% power to detect an effect
size of 0.72 (Cohen ’s D). This effect size corresponds to
ab e t w e e n - s i t ed i f f e r e n c eo f2 1p e r c e n t a g ep o i n t si nt h epercentage of veterans with an updated clinical status.
For the secondary outcome the percentage of veterans
contacted, based on the initial values of 35% (SD = 29%),and ICC = 0.31, with 80% power we will can detect an
effect size of 0.78 (Cohen ’s D), which corresponds to an
approximate difference of 22 percentage points. Similarly,Kilbourne et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:136 Page 8 of 14

Covariates of implementation outcomes
Drawing on the Consolidated Framework for Implementa-
tion Science (CFIR) [68] and the PARiHS Framework, we
identified organizational and facility as well as patient-levelvariables that we will adjust for in examining implementa-
tion of Re-Engage. Covariates are listed in Table 2, along
with the constructs they represent based on CFIR, and thedata source(s) that will be used to ascertain the variable.
Data sources for patient-level data will include informa-
tion ascertained from national VA administrative databases(e.g., National Psychosis Registry) as well as information
gathered through Local Recovery Coordinators ’contacts
with veterans. Data sources for organizational and context-ual factors will include VA administrative records and the
all-employee survey, minutes from standard REP technical
assistance calls, and surveys co mpleted by facility clinicians
and administrators. Surveys were disseminated to facility
Local Recovery Coordinators, H omelessness Coordinators,
and Mental Health Service Line Leaders beginning inMarch 2012. The surveys sent to the Local Recovery
Coordinators and Homeless C oordinators ascertained
their job duties and the frequency of their interactionswith clinicians in other roles. Mental Health Service Line
Leaders were provided with the Mental Health Program
Survey [69] to assess structural and organizational char-acteristics of mental health services at the facility. For
facilities that received enhanced REP , Facilitators ’notes
on contacts with facilities and stakeholders will serve asadditional data sources.
Qualitative data from Facilitators ’notes and technical
assistance minutes will be coded to identify possiblebarriers and facilitators to program implementation. Al-
though many of the potential covariates were identified
a priori (e.g., structural and organizational characteristics),
additional potential covariates have been identified through
standard REP and enhanced REP processes.
Monitoring implementation intervention
A central component of the Re-Engage adaptive implemen-
tation intervention design was documenting and monitor-ing activities related to the implementation interventions.
A primary reason for documenting these activities was not
only to monitor whether the implementation interven-tions are being conducted with fidelity, but to monitor the
time and effort required in order to determine the added
costs of enhanced REP over time. For sites that receivedenhanced REP , Facilitators completed a regular log form
for each contact with each site provider, and notes from
these contact sheets serve as additional data sources tomonitor facilitation activities and time (Table 3). Data
from Facilitators ’notes and minutes from the Facilitators ’
weekly meetings will be coded using a previously establishedfidelity tool for enhanced REP [13] to determine to what
extent Facilitators utilized core components of facilitation.
The tool will assess core tasks of facilitation, notablywhether the Facilitators iden tified possible barriers and
solutions to Re-Engage implementation at each site, and
whether site providers used Facilitator recommendations.
Trial status
To date the run-in phase and phase one of the imple-mentation trial have been completed, and phase two of
the trial is ongoing at this time. All 39 sites within 9
VA regional networks that received enhanced REP dur-ing phase one have now returned to receiving standard
REP. Of the 49 sites within 11 VA regional networks
that were randomized to standard REP during phaseone of the trial, 36 sites (73.5%) in 10 VA regional net-
works continued to have less than 80% of their patients
on their list with updated clinical status at the end ofphase 1 and will receive enhanced REP.
Discussion
This paper describes to our knowledge one of the first
adaptive implementation intervention trial designs. The
study is testing the effectiveness of facilitation as an adjunctto standard REP among non-responding sites on the imple-
mentation of a national VA pr ogram, Re-Engage, which is
designed to assist patients with serious mental illness whohave dropped out of care return to VA services.
An adaptive implementation design was optimal for
this particular study because enhanced REP includedadditional personnel time and effort that may, over
time, be too expensive to implement. Not all sites may
need a more intensive implementation intervention(enhanced REP facilitation) to promote the uptake of an
effective program. Hence, the adaptive nature of this trial
randomized sites that required additional assistance, whichallowed for more efficient use of facilitation resources.
In addition, comparing the timing of added facilitation
(immediately after observed non-response in phase one orsix months later during phase two) provided an opportunity
to focus on the impact of facilitation among later adopters
of effective programs at the site level.
In addition, this study was also to date one of the first
implementation intervention trials that took advantage
of a population-based, national rollout of an effectiveprogram within a US health system. Hence, the study
sought to use the VA ’s national mandate to implement
Re-Engage as the foundation for a natural experiment totest different implementation intervention strategies.
The VA was an ideal setting in which to conduct this
adaptive implementation trial because of the availabilityKilbourne et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:136 Page 10 of 14
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/8/1/136
of national patient data and provider networks to identify
those who had dropped out of care and to monitor sub-
sequent use and outcomes at the patient and site levels.
By including all sites that were required to implementRe-Engage per the mandate, there was opportunity to
test the implementation interventions among sites that
were less likely to initially respond to a lower-cost im-plementation strategy (REP ). Previous implementationintervention trials often had to seek permission first
from sites to participate in a study, often leading to poten-
tial cherry-picking and selection effects that may skew im-
plementation results [19].
Another advantage in conduc ting an adaptive implemen-
tation strategy is that measuring site contextual factors that
might influence program uptak e is not required. Instead,
sites are included in the randomization portion of the studyTable 3 Documentation of enhanced REP Facilitators ’Core Component Tasks and Time

only if they are not responding to an initial implementation
strategy, and the reasons for non-response may not be
observable or measurable even with organizational as-sessments. Moreover, because the national rollout of
Re-Engage occurred relatively quickly, the window of
opportunity to ascertain or ganizational data across all
of the sites to predict implementation non-response was
limited. Several organizational assessments exist [70], but
to date most have not been systematically used to identifypredictors of program uptake, and those predictors may
vary depending on the particular program.
There are limitations to this type of design that warrant
consideration, especially when deciding to replicate the
design in other settings. Notably, adaptive implementation
intervention designs are potentially less feasible in settingswithout large numbers of sites that are either willing or
mandated to provide the effective program, and have access
to common data sources to ga uge patient outcomes.
Second, the large number of sites precluded more intensive
monitoring of program fidel ity beyond documentation
by the frontline provider via the website. Third, costconsiderations precluded having Facilitators as part of
the enhanced REP intervention make site visits or involve
local site leaders on a more regular basis. At least one priorstudy or enhanced REP included an Internal as well as
External Facilitator who can provider more on-the-ground
coaching and guidance to the frontline mental health pro-vider, linking them to leaders and resources not available
or known to an outside External Facilitator [31-34].
Conclusions
The results of this study will yield new information on
how to conduct adaptive implementation intervention trialsat the national level. These findings will have the potential
to inform not only further implementation research,
but also the actual implementation of effective programsin large healthcare settings. This study also sets the stage
for determining the added value of more intensive imple-
mentation interventions within sites that need additionalsupport to promote the uptake of effective programs.
Ultimately, adaptive implementation designs may produce
more relevant, rapid, and generalizable results by morequickly validating or rejecting new implementation strat-
egies, thus enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of
implementation research and potentially lead to the roll-out of more cost-efficient implementation strategies.
