Abstract
Background: There is a considerable evidence base for ‘collaborative care ’as a method to improve quality of care
for depression, but an acknowledged gap between efficacy and implementation. This study utilises the
Normalisation Process Model (NPM) to inform the process of implementation of collaborative care in both a future
full-scale trial, and the wider health economy.
Methods: Application of the NPM to qualitative data collected in both focus groups and one-to-one interviews
before and after an exploratory randomised controlled trial of a collaborative model of care for depression.
Results: Findings are presented as they relate to the four factors of the NPM (interactional workability, relational
integration, skill-set workability, and contextual integration) and a number of necessary tasks are identified. Using
the model, it was possible to observe that predictions about necessary work to implement collaborative care that
could be made from analysis of the pre-trial data relating to the four different factors of the NPM were indeed
borne out in the post-trial data. However, additional insights were gained from the post-trial interview participants
who, unlike those interviewed before the trial, had direct experience of a novel intervention. The professional
freedom enjoyed by more senior mental health workers may work both for and against normalisation of
collaborative care as those who wish to adopt new ways of working have the freedom to change their practice
but are not obliged to do so.
Conclusions: The NPM provides a useful structure for both guiding and analysing the process by which an
intervention is optimized for testing in a larger scale trial or for subsequent full-scale implementation.
Background
There is now a considerable evidence base for collabora-
tive care as a ‘technology ’in the broadest sense for
improving quality of care depression in the community
[1,2], but an acknowledged gap between demonstrated
efficacy of this novel intervention in randomised con-
trolled trials and implementation in everyday practice
[3]. Gunn and her colleagues [4] have described colla-
borative care for depression as a ‘system level ’interven-
tion with four key characteristics:1. A multi-professional approach to patient care: This
requires that a general practitioner (GP) or family physi-
cian and at least one other health professional ( e.g.,
nurse, psychologist, psychiatrist, pharmacist) are
involved with patient care.
2. A structured management plan: in the form of
guidelines or protocols: Interventions may include both
pharmacological ( e.g., antidepressant medication) and
non-pharmacological interventions ( e.g., patient screen-
ing, patient and provider ed ucation, counselling, cogni-
tive behaviour therapy).
3. Scheduled patient follow-up: An organised approach
to patient follow-up by systematically contacting* Correspondence: Linda.Gask@manchester.ac.uk

patients to provide specific interventions, facilitate treat-
ment adherence, or monitor symptoms or adverseeffects.

introducing mechanisms to facilitate communication
between professionals caring for the depressed person.
This might include team meetings, case conferences,
individual consultation/supervision, shared medicalrecords, patient-specific written or verbal feedbackbetween caregivers.
In the United Kingdom (UK) the Medical Research
Council (MRC) guideline for the evaluation of complexinterventions provided a phased methodological frame-work [5] highlighting the need for evaluation of process,
which is essential for understanding the problems of
integration of interventio ns into healthcare settings.
Application of the framewor k suggested exploration of
barriers and facilitators to implementation, which is an
approach that has now been extensively used to under-stand the difficulties in implementation of collaborativecare in the United States (US) [6-9]. However, the meth-odology used in these analyses has also been largely
pragmatic, with only limited use of theoretical models
to either interpret their find ings or develop hypotheses
for future research. The revised MRC Framework pub-lished in 2007 [10] emphasiz ed the iterative nature of
the tasks of defining and understanding the problemand its context, developing and optimizing and thenevaluating the intervention, rather than viewing these asdistinct conceptual stages. The utility of theoretical
models drawing on health psychology (if the problem to
be tackled is individuals ’health behaviour) or social and
organisational theory (to understand health service andpractitioner factors) was specifically highlighted in thisiteration of the framework, however the process bywhich an intervention is optimized for testing in a largerscale trial or for subsequent wide scale implementationremains ad hoc , with no clear framework to guide the
researcher or future service developer.
Recently, May [11] proposed that the Normalization
Process Model (NPM –s e eT a b l e1 )p r o v i d e sat h e o r e t i -
cal framework for understanding the workability (cap-able of being put into operation) and integration(assimilation into practice) of a complex interventionand demonstrated how this can used to understand trialoutcomes [12]. Normalisation is concerned with the
routine embedding of a classification, artefact, techni-
que, or organisation practice in everyday work, and theNPM is specifically concerned with the work that peopledo to make a complex intervention work in everydaypractice. It is therefore complementary to diffusion the-ory [13,14], which is concerned with the diffusion ofinnovation across networks, and psychological theories[15,16] that are concerned with intention and individualbehaviour that might dispose professionals to adopt an
intervention. May and colleagues have suggested thatthe NPM might be used to assess the normalizationpotential of a working practice (see table 1).
Brief description of the collaborative care trial
As part of an exploratory trial of collaborative care fordepression in a UK setting [17-19], we carried out aprocess evaluation to explore how the interventionmight be adapted and made to work optimally in prac-tice. The study team undertook a Phase II patient-levelrandomized controlled trial in primary care [18], nestedwithin a cluster-randomize d trial (this was in order to
determine whether cluster- or patient-randomization
would be the most appropriate design for a Phase III
clinical trial –s e eF i g u r e1 ) .T h et r i a lu s e da ni n n o v a t i v e
design to determine the existence of contamination, aswell as the effect of the collaborative care intervention.
Collaborative care includes a component that impacts
on the individual patient (e.g., medication managementfrom the case manager) and a component that impactson the professionals and the practice (e.g., feedback of
patient information to the GP, changes in practice orga-
nisation). In a standard, indi vidually randomised trial,
the component that impacts on the professional and thepractice can lead to contamination, because it may influ-ence patients in the control group. This trial used anindividually randomised trial nested within a clustertrial. The design enables an analysis of the effect of thewhole collaborative care intervention (through a com-
parison of group one and group three), and an analysis
of any potential contamination (through a comparisonof group two and group three).
Depressed participants were randomized to ‘collabora-
tive care ’–case manager-coordinated medication support
and brief psychological treatment, enhanced specialistand GP communication –or a usual care control. The
primary outcome was severity of depression (PHQ-9
[20]). In all, 114 participants were recruited, 41 to the
intervention group, 38 to the patient randomized con-trol group, and 35 to the clus ter-randomized control
group. For the intervention compared to the clustercontrol, the PHQ-9 effect size was 0.63 (95% CI 0.18 to1.07). There was evidence of substantial contamination
between intervention and patient-randomized controlparticipants, with less difference between the interven-
tion group and patient-randomized control group (-2.99,
95% CI -7.56 to 1.58, p = 0.186) than between the inter-vention and cluster-randomized control group (-4.64,95% CI -7.93 to -1.35, p = 0.008).
From this ‘trial platform ’study, we aimed to develop a
larger scale phase IV clinical multi-centred trial (which,given the results reported a bove, would subsequently

recognised early in the conception of the project that a
considerable amount of work would be required to opti-mize an intervention originally designed in the US for aBritish setting, and we thus aimed to collect extensive
qualitative data at different stages of the process.
Aims of this study
In this paper, we will apply the NPM to our process
data in order to consider what we can learn about theadditional or ‘hidden ’work ( i.e., that which is not imme-
diately apparent at conception of the project or notusually included in publication of results of a trial) that
needs to be done to make a collaborative care interven-
tion for depression in primary care both workable andintegrated into routine practice in both our forthcomingfull-scale trial of collaborative care for depression in theUK and the wider healthcare settings following the trial.In initiating this task, we were particularly interested inthe value of application of the NPM to process data inorder to aid us in further development and evaluation of
this intervention in the UK. This is a novel approach
which has not, to our knowledge, yet been widelyadopted for use at different stages in the formal analysisof a complex intervention to inform further iterations ofthe research process, even though it was originallyintended for purpose [11].
Methods
Application of the NPM to data collected in both focusgroups and one-to-one interviews with both practi-tioners and patients before and after an exploratory ran-domised controlled trial of a collaborative model of carefor depression (see Figure 2).We utilized the data to both understand and identify
the ‘hidden work ’essential to optimizing the interven-
tion not apparent at the conceptualisation and designstage of the intervention and make predictions about
future issues in implementation. Key questions (see
table 1) relevant to the specific intervention werederived from the four factors of the NPM by the leadauthor, who had previous of experience of working withthe NPM and discussed with the wider research team.They were considered to be highly relevant to therequirements of the study and no further iterations wererequired. We considered that data collected before the
trial would enable us to test out the predictive value of
the NPM in terms of what actually happened in the trialplatform, and the data collected after the trial would beof particular value in revising the content of the inter-vention in terms of both the forthcoming large scaletrial and wider dissemination.
Before the trial
The detailed description of protocol development can befound elsewhere [17]. We identified key prototype colla-borative care components using a systematic review andmeta-regression [21]. We used qualitative methods toprovide a contextualized picture of the views of key sta-keholders on the acceptability, feasibility, and barriers tocollaborative care for depression in the UK.
Sample
A convenience sample of stakeholders was recruitedfrom primary care organizations (PCOs) in the north oft h eU K .P r i m a r yC a r eP h y s i cians (PCPs) and practice
nurses were recruited from practices in PCOs that hadTable 1 Normalization Process Model from May et al . 2007
The collective action and interactions of patients, professionals and others are governed by four factors. We have derived questions from
these factors as follows:
(i) Interactional workability : This refers to how work is enacted by the
people doing it. A complex intervention will affect co-operative interactionover work (congruence), and the normal pattern of outcomes of this work(disposal).How does collaborative care for depression (CCD) impact on basic
communication, clinical care and treatment at the level of patient andprofessional?
(ii) Relational integration : This refers to how work is understood within the
networks of people around it. A complex intervention will affect not onlythe knowledge required by its users (accountability), but also the ways thatthey understand the actions of people around them (confidence).How does CCD impact on the way that health professionals relate to
each other?Does it seem to be the right thing to be doing?It is perceived as valid and/or useful?
Who needs to be involved in the work?
How do we inform them and link with them?
(iii) Skill-set workability : This refers to the place of work in a division of
labor. A complex intervention will affect the ways that work is defined anddistributed (allocation), and the ways in which it is undertaken andevaluated (performance).Does this mean health professionals learning new skills or doing
things differently?Is there a person available with the right set of skills to implementCCD?Does CCD challenge professional autonomy over working practices?Does it impact on case load and allocation of work?
(iv) Contextual integration : This refers to the organizational sponsorship
and control of work. A complex intervention will affect the mechanisms
that link work to existing structures and procedures (execution), and for
allocating and organizing resources for them (realization)Who has the power to make CCD happen?
Does the system want it to happen?
How can we divert resources to it?Gask et al.Implementation Science 2010, 5:15

agreed to participate in the trial. Other participants were
recruited from teams and specialist care providers that
provided primary and secondary mental healthcare to
the PCOs. Patients were recruited by four participatingPCPs who each mailed a letter to 20 of their patientswho were receiving treatment for depression in primarycare. No participants had had any experience of thismethod of organizing care and none been involved in
the trial design.
We interviewed 49 participants. All 38 professionals
who were asked to participate in the study agreed to do
so: 12 PCPs, four psychiatrists, four clinical psycholo-gists, four practice nurses and 14 mental health workers(seven mental health nurses, two counsellors, threegraduate mental health workers, one social worker, andone unqualified support worker). We had planned toconduct focus groups with all respondents, but toarrange mutually convenient times for separate groups
of GPs, professionals, and patients proved to be impossi-
ble. Therefore, most interviews were conducted indivi-
dually apart from two focus groups with 11 of the 14mental health staff. From the 80 letters posted topatients, 17 consented to participate of which 11 wereinterviewed, five subseque ntly declined or could not be
contacted, and one became so distressed that the inter-view was abandoned on ethical grounds and the patientwas encouraged to contact the PCP.
Data collection
We had earlier filmed four role-plays, representing thosekey clinical features of collaborative care that could berepresented on film. These included the necessity forbrevity of contact in this therapeutic approach (not
hour-long sessions); use of telephone consultations; theGroup 2

need for a patient-centered, collaborative approach to
care, problem-focused interviewing style; informationgiving; the skills of medication management and beha-vioural activation (BA) –an evidence-based psychological
treatment for depression [22], which has been used in
the low-intensity manner required for short patient con-tacts in collaborative care. Participants were sent a copyof this videotape/DVD to view prior to their interview.
Interviews and focus groups were structured using an
identical topic guide. Althou gh topic areas were similar
for patients and professionals, questions to patientsfocused on their views about potential receipt of the
intervention, whereas questions to professionals focused
on delivering it. The interviews lasted approximately 30to 40 minutes, while the focus group activity lasted 1 to1.5 hours.
After the trial
We carried out a further round of one-to-one interviewswith case managers and patients who have received the
intervention..
Sample
All of the eight case managers from the trial –five gradu-
ate mental health workers, one counsellor, two mentalhealth nurses(who had both participated in the pre-trialfocus groups) –and 13 of the patients who had been in
receipt of the intervention were purposively selected for
age, gender, and profession of case manager. We were
unable to obtain interviews with the PCPs involved inthe study due to our resource pressures.Data collection
Data were collected using semi-structured interviews.Patients were asked what they thought about how theintervention was structured, the relationship with thecase manager, what they learned about depression fromthe intervention, and their views about the different ele-ments of the intervention. They were also asked if con-
tacts with, or attitude to, their PCP had altered as a
consequence of their involvement in the trial, andwhether their symptoms improved or not as a result oftheir participation. The de tailed findings from the
patient interviews are reported elsewhere [19].
Case managers were asked how the study protocol dif-
fered from their usual approach to assessment and treat-ment, whether they had any problems with adapting
their style of working at all, either in specific ways or
with specific clients. We also explored whether therewas anything about the protocol that they found benefi-cial or difficult, and what was its impact on both profes-sional and patient. We asked how easy or difficult itwould be for them to adapt their routine way of work-ing to the Collaborative Care for Depression protocol,and the personal and organisational barriers that might
exist. Finally, we requested their views on the written
materials and the supervision they had received.
Analysis of the data for this paper
Data analysis was led by the lead author. Two sets ofdata were entered into the analysis: the pre-trial datathat was obtained from interviews and focus groupswith participants who observed the DVD of role-played

happen in trying to adapt the intervention; and post-trial
data with patients and practitioners who enacted theintervention in the trial platform study.
LG coded the data utilising a simple template [23] or
ap r i o r i coding manual specifically derived from May ’s
original description of the NPM [11], with specific ques-
tions derived from the four factors to address imple-
mentation of collaborative care for depression (see table1). This was then entered onto MAXqda2 qualitativeanalysis software [24]. A total of 61 transcripts (consist-ing of 59 individual interviews and two focus groups)were included in the analysis. Only data that could becoded according to the NPM-derived template was con-sidered. The findings were discussed in detail with the
trial research team, and underwent subsequent revisions
to achieve consensus that th ey accurately reflected the
original data and the lessons to be learned from thestudy for future implementation.
Results
We will present the findings as they relate to the ques-tions derived from the four factors of the NPM. Several
of these arose in relation to the factors in the pre-trial
interviews and focus groups that we had not previouslyconsidered (and thus were ‘hidden work ’that needed to
be considered and carried out to make the study workthat not apparent at the time of trial design), and othersarose during the study (and were not predicted in thepre-trial interviews and focus groups) and thus were‘hidden ’until participants had direct experience of this
kind of intervention, and will inform future work.
Interactional workability of collaborative care
How does collaborative care for depression impact on basiccommunication, clinical care, and treatment at the level ofpatient and professional?
The specific communication and confidentiality issues
that might and did indeed arise in telephone interviews
were successfully predicted beforehand:
’I’d see difficulties with not being able to pick up on
cues. ’(mental health nurse, before trial)
’Maybe the interviewer would have to say ‘I’dl i k et o
speak to you now but some of the questions mightbe quite sensitive. Could you tell me where you are?Are you alone? Are you happy to speak? ”(psychia-
trist, before trial)
Also predicted was the always potentially difficult task
of‘ending ’a brief therapeutic relationship:
’It should be an open-ended thing. I don ’tt h i n k
treatment should stop, but it would be ‘Iw o n ’tb e
ringing you up now –but I ’ll ring you in six month ’stime, but you can always ring me if there are any
issues ’.I’d say probably [end] over two to three
months –but it would be between the case worker
and the patient. ’(Patient two, before trial)
Engaging the patient in the process of collaborative
care by simultaneously building up trust, but also
explaining the systematic a nd collaborative nature of
this approach to care, with regular structured assess-ments of progress, was challenging, and undoubtedlyeasier if the first contact was face-to-face:
’They wanted...counselling, even though I did
emphasize that I wasn ’t counselling,...it took time, to
b u i l du pt r u s tw i t ht h e m . ’(case manager graduate
worker, after trial)’I think it was important that they went through the
standard set of questions every time they spoke. Ifelt that everything was exp lained to the client, why
he was doing what he was doing –it was very much
‘I’ll work together with you ’rather than ‘I’mj u s t
another professional that wants to get rid of you. ’
(patient eight, after trial)
Postal preparation for th e telephone session also
proved to be important:
’Sometimes it ’s useful to use diagrams to explain
specific things to people and you can ’td ot h a to v e r
the phone. ’(case manager/graduate worker after
trial)
We have previously reported the divergence of views
in the before-study interviews about the impact of thetelephone on the process of care [17]. This divergenceof views was also mirrored in our post-study data:
’Probably it was easier speaking over the phone,
because I was busy at work and it was very conveni-
ent. ’(patient.four, after trial)
’It seemed a lot more impersonal on the phone...I
know it ’s daft, but it seems like they care more when
you can see them, the reactions on their faces andthings. ’(patient nine, after trial)
However, given that the collaborative care protocol
also had a positive impact on both quantitative and qua-
litative outcomes [18,19], and was perceived by the casemanagers as improving access to treatment for peoplewho might otherwise not engage, it could certainly bec o n c l u d e dt h a ti tc o n f e r sa na d v a n t a g eo v e re x i s t i n gapproaches to clinical care. Indeed sceptical profes-sionals were won over to it:Gask et al.Implementation Science 2010, 5:15
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/15Page 6 of 11
’I always tended to look at using the telephone...well
it’s a second way, a substandard way of offering a
therapeutic intervention...but I suppose my viewshave changed from being part of this project. ’(case
manager/mental health nurse, after trial)’I suppose, [I] learned to listen to what was not
being said rather than what was being said and sort
of trying a bit more to pay attention to the silencesa little. Trying to pick up more when peoplesounded uncertain or unsure and tones of voicesmostly. Yes, it was just a bit different. ’(case man-
ager/mental health nurse, after trial)
Some of the case managers adjusted their own clinical
styles of working with patie nts to the trial protocol.
Others found this difficult (the counsellor –see below)
whilst some, particularly those trained as graduate men-tal health workers, did not need to do so to any greatdegree:
’I was fortunate in that the style with which I nor-
mally work is very similar, in fact identical to this. ’
(case manager/graduate mental health worker, after
trial)
But others, as we have indicated, questioned some
aspects of the protocol as a valid way of interacting withpatients, for example when it came to the need foractive engagement:
’It’s got to be there from the client, they have to
want to help themselves to move forward. ’(case
manager/counsellor, after trial)
The tasks that we identified as necessary work to opti-
mise interactional workability for future studies aresummarised in appendix 1.
Relational integration
How does Collaborative Care impact on the way thathealth professionals relate to each other?
Who needs to be involved? How do we inform them
and link with them? Issues that arose in the trial with
respect to the need for clari ty of arrangements for liai-
son between patient, PCP, and case manager, and theroles and responsibilities of the specialist supervisors in
relation to the PCP were predicted beforehand:
’Different doctors have different approaches. Some
don ’tl i k ea n y o n ee l s ei n t e r f e r i n ga ta l l ,o t h e r sa r e
fairly open. ’(PCP, before trial)
’I would expect to be the person doing the referral,
even if we ’d discussed it....We might debate it, but I
don ’t think I would argue with somebody withmental health experience saying, ‘I’mh e a r i n gt h i n g s
that bother me. ’I would do the referral. ’(PCP,
before trial)
We can anecdotally confirm that these did indeed pro-
vide to be important. However we were unable to
explore these issues in greater depth after the interven-
tion because we did not carry out post-interventioninterviews with the PCPs.Does it seem to be the right thing to be doing? Is itperceived as valid and/or useful? Aw i d ev a r i e t yo f
views were expressed before the study about the ele-ments of the protocol [17], with some degree of scepti-cism about the evidence base:
’It h i n kI ’dj u s tg ob a c kt ot h ef a c tt h a ti fy o u ’re
looking at developing these roles, there needs to begood evidence that people are going to benefit fromit..... It ’sg o tt ob ear e a l l ys t r o n ge v i d e n c eb a s et h a t
it’sag o o du s eo ft i m e ,m o n e ye t c . ’(psychiatrist,
before trial)
I tw a sn o tas u r p r i s et of i n dt h a tc a s em a n a g e r s
described some hostility to the model amongst their col-leagues:
’I think the biggest organisational resistance is, that I
hear constantly, is ‘b u tw h a ta b o u tt h eu n d e r l y i n g
themes, what about the core beliefs that reoccur, ’
and without working on the underlying themes...
then what we are doing is, people would say, sticking
a plaster over the cracks...when I have presented thisat Psychology Awayday...those were the type of com-ments I got. ’(case manager/mental health nurse,
after trial)
From the viewpoint of the case managers who partici-
pated in the trial, there was a need to adjust the depres-
sion focus of the protocol in research practice to the
reality of co-morbidity issues in primary care practice:
’There ’s things like abuse, self-harm, and stuff like
that, underlying things that may come up...a protocolon what happens when you cover the more nastysort of experiences will be an issue. Anxiety...its aprotocol for depression,...we get such a mixed pic-
ture.... ’(case manager/mental health nurse, after
trial)
The tasks that we identified as necessary work to opti-
mise relational integration for
future studies are summarised in appendix 2.Gask et al.Implementation Science 2010, 5:15

Skill-set workability
Does this mean health professionals learning new skills or
doing things differently? Is there a person available withthe right set of skills to implement Collaborative Care?
Before the trial experienced mental health professionals
had strong views about who would be qualified to carryout the role:
Interviewer: ‘What kind of people do you see as case
managers? ’
CPN [community psychiatric nurse]: ‘Oh, CPNs.
Definitely CPNs! Social workers. Anybody but pri-mary care mental health workers. ’(case manager/
mental health nurse, before trial)
But some recognised the potential for graduate or new
primary care mental health workers [25], who are health
or social science (typically psychology) graduates with
one further year of training, to fulfil the role of casemanagers:
’I’mn o ts u r ei ft h eg r a d u a t ew o r k e r sa r e n ’td o i n ga
lot of it already....That ’s the training that they ’ve
been given and that ’s what they ’re doing. ’(psychia-
trist, before trial)
Five of the eight case managers in our study had
received such training and two of the other three clearlyfound it (relatively) easy to adapt their style of working(the counsellor found it more problematic):
’I tw a st h ew a yt h a tw ew e r et a u g h ti no u rt r a i n i n g
to do that. ’(case manager/graduate worker, after
trial)
’I felt quite daunted at first, I consider myself to be
an experienced mental health professional, but, I feltvery strange at first just thinking am I asking all theright questions...and it felt like I was starting againreally. ’(case manager./mental health nurse, after
trial)
Does Collaborative Care challenge professional autonomy
over working practices? Does it impact on case load and
allocation of work?
We observed that working practices at the organisa-
tional level sometimes made it difficult for some of thecase managers to utilize their skills and/or work to theprotocol:
’...our protocol is, you must never ever call a patient
from home, ever. If you are going to call a patient
you have to call them where you have access to ser-vices if something goes wrong. That means that youhave to have access to a doctor. ’(Case manager/
graduate worker, after trial)It was those case managers who held more senior
posts, and not holding the post of graduate mental
health worker ( i.e., not those basically trained in the
desired skill set) who had the most freedom to be ableto overcome these difficulties because of the relatively
autonomous way in which they worked within the orga-
nisation:
’I have had to take time, I have been taking time
back from phoning people on an evening. ’(case
manager/mental health nurse, after trial)
In addition, the working practices and governance
arrangements concerned with management of risk need
to be well developed:
’It needs to cover the area of risk .... They need clear
guidance, a protocol to follow and a pathway foreach scenario if something happens. ’(mental health
nurse, before trial)
And the role of supervision predicted in the pre-trial
data was confirmed in post-trial interviews with the casemanagers:
’If you see the case manager as replacing the CPN,
which is how I see it, in a way, then the next personup who we need advice from, is going to be the con-sultant psychiatrist. ’(PCP, before trial).
’That was quite nice, being able to have any queries
about medication being answered straightaway by aconsultant psychiatrist. ’(case manager/mental health
nurse, after trial)
Given the small number of cases managed by each
worker in the trial, the impact on workload was difficultto assess. Key issues for skill- set workability in future
studies are summarised in appendix 3.
Contextual integration
Who has the power to make collaborative care fordepression happen? Does the system want it to happen?How can we divert resources to it?
Although funding is a major factor in contextual inte-
gration, it is not the only issue. The management sys-
tems set up to oversee how care is delivered are also
crucial and management needs to be capable of facilitat-ing new ways of working. In the pre-trial data, the issueof out-of-hours working to allow for flexibility in con-tacting people by telephone was not predicted butproved to be an issue. However systems proved inflex-ible in accommodating this:Gask et al.Implementation Science 2010, 5:15

’Yes. I ’m sure it would be useful to [telephone] in an
evening, if it was possible, if that makes sense. Ifthere was a place we could do it. And I supposethere is a reluctance, obviously getting people towork during evenings, just trying to find the workersthat are willing to do that late shift if that makes
sense. ’(Case manager/graduate worker, after trial)
We have noted above the flexibility in working prac-
tices that experienced mental health professionals enjoyin the National Health Service (NHS) that thereforemakes introduction of new working practices potentiallyboth more and less problematic. Our experienced pro-fessionals were free to choose to adopt this model of
working, but the same professional freedom for mental
health workers makes it harder to impose a new work-ing practice across the board.
Change is especially problematic where professional
rivalries surface:
’There are always barriers, be cause different profes-
sionals have views about their own importance and
are wanting to protect their ‘tribal ’interests...It ’sa n
issue about who manages who and who has thepower –that ’s always an issue. But not insurmounta-
ble. ’(psychologist, before trial)
Introduction of any new way of working in an organi-
sation will require effective and informed leadership tomanage inter-professional rivalries and the interests of
existing services and the development and implementa-
tion of a credible business plan:
’There are not a lot of people in primary care at the
moment working with dep ression. So if you take
people away to do that, you will be taking themaway from doing something else, and I think theresistance will be that the something else is very
important, so will it be worth it? ’(psychiatrist, before
trial)’Somebody somewhere has to get up in the helicop-
ter and look down and dec ide what they want. But
that ’s not how it seems to happen. What happens is
that people come along and build on sexy new bitsof project, to what exists currently. And you end upwith a bigger mess than when you started. What you
need is for someone to stand back and work out
what is really wanted and how it should all be linkedtogether. ’(psychologist, before trial)
Issues in optimising contextual integration are
addressed in appendix 4.Discussion
The value of the NPM
The NPM provided us with a neat and conceptually richframework to guide analysis and our thinking about a
range of key issues in the implementation of collabora-
tive care for depression in both research trials and rou-tine practice. It provided a novel way of evaluating andinterpreting process data that added value to the analy-sis. Using the model, it was possible to observe that cer-tain predictions about work that would need to be donethat could be made from analysis of the pre-trial datarelating to the four different factors of the NPM were
borne out in the post-trial data. This work was impor-
tant in our detailed preparation for the trial, althoughwe were still not able to characterise exactly what itinvolved until completing the trial platform study. Addi-tionally, it may be difficult to predict exactly what workis involved if participants have no experience of a novelintervention, thus we gaine d some particular insights
from post-trial data. In our experience, the importance
of doing this work in the preparation for a trial, in order
to make a novel intervention work in the setting of astudy, is rarely reported with the findings of the trial,and thus this work remains hidden.
Lessons for collaborative care trials
In our large scale, MRC-funded trial of collaborativecare for depression [26], we have learned that it will be
essential to address a number of key issues in the pre-
paration of both case managers and supervisors. Theseinclude how to engage the patient and explain both thesystematic nature of the approach to care (particularlythe regular assessment of severity using the PHQ-9) andthe time-limited nature of the intervention. There isalso a need to address the acquisition of the skillsrequired for telephone working. Clear protocols have
been agreed for liaison between professionals and the
issue of how to deal with co-morbidities (such as anxietydisorders) has been explicitly addressed.
Further lessons for wider implementation of collaborative
care
The implementation of collaborative care models in the
setting of the NHS means that existing relationships,
received wisdom about ways of working, and profes-
sional roles are challenged, and the organisational tasksrequired for implementation are considerable but by nomeans insurmountable. Our findings under the headingof‘contextual integration ’will be of particular relevance
here. The professional freedom enjoyed by more seniormental health workers in the NHS may work both forand against normalisation of collaborative care as thoseGask et al.Implementation Science 2010, 5:15
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/15Page 9 of 11
who wish to adopt new ways of working have the free-
dom to do so but are not obliged to do so.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
Our failure to interview PCPs after the intervention hadbeen delivered was undoubtedly a weakness of the pre-
sent study. However, we collected a considerable num-
ber of interviews in both phases of data collection, andthe post-intervention data was not collected from onebut four different Primary Care Trusts in the North ofEngland. Nevertheless, we a re aware that our partici-
pants who were essentially a convenience sample mayhave been biased, and more open to considering changein practice from more routine and familiar styles of
care. We are also aware that we may not have asked all
of the important questions of the data, and otherresearchers may have derived a wider range of questionsfrom application of the four factors of the NPM to this
study. This is something that we will revisit in futurestudies utilizing the model. Additionally, we have notaddressed in this research the range of complex issuesinvolved in bringing about organisational change in
healthcare, only what needs to be done [27]. Future
research might utilise the NPM in addressing the workthat is required to implement collaborative care on amuch larger scale into a routine healthcare setting,using results of this study in the development ofhypotheses that can be tested in the full-scale trial.
Summary
The NPM provides a useful structure for both guidingand analysing the process by which an intervention isoptimized for testing in a larger scale trial or for subse-quent wide-scale implementation. Using this framework,we have developed what we hope will be useful guidancefor those already implementing collaborative care mod-els, both in the UK, (as part of the Improving Access toPsychological Therapies initiative being led by the
Department of Health [28]) and internationally, as it
focuses not simply on what are the barriers but whathas to be done in practice to make an intervention reallywork.
