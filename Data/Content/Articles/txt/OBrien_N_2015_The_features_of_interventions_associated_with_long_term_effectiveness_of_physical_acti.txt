 Abstract  
Content , delivery  and effects of physical activity (PA) interventions are heterogeneous . There 
is a need to identify intervention  features (content and delivery) related to long -term 
effectiveness. Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and modes of intervention delivery were 
coded in 19 randomised controlled trials  included in a systematic review of PA interventions 
for adults aged 55 -70 years , published between 2000 and 2010,  with PA outcomes ≥12 months 
after randomisation ; protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42011001459.  Meta -analysis, 
moderator analyses and meta -regression were conducted. Meta -analysis revealed that  
interventions were effective in promot ing PA compared with no/minimal intervention 
comparator s (d=0.29, 95% CI=0.19 to 0.40 , I2=79.8%, Q -value=89.16 (df=18, p<0.01) ). 
Intervention features often concurred  and goal setting  was the most commonly used BCT . 
Subgroup analyses suggest ed that interventions using the BCT  feedback may be more 
effective, whilst interventions using printed materials  or the BCTs information on where and 
when to perform the behaviour  and information on consequences of behaviour to the  individual  
may be less effective. Meta -regression revealed that neither t he number of BCTs nor self -
regulatory BCTs significantly relate d to effect size. Feedback  appear s to be  a potentially 
effective candidate BCT for future interventions  promoting  long-term PA.  Considering 
concurrence of i ntervention features alongside  moderator analyses is important.

Introduction  
The health benefits of engaging in regular physical activity (PA) are numerous and well 
documented (Kohl et al., 2012 ). Moreover, there is a  positive association between physical 
 
4 
 inactivity and the prevalence of age -related disease and disability (Lee et al., 2012 ).  
International guideline s recommend  that each week adults, including those  aged 65 years and 
over, should do at least 150 minutes of moderate -intensity aerobic PA, 75 minutes of high -
intensity aerobic PA, or a combination thereof  (World Health Organization, 2010 ).  Despit e 
this recommendation, less than 10% of middle to older age adults meet current 
recommendations when using  objective measures of PA (Tucker, Welk, & Beyler, 2011 ). 
Short to medium -term, m oderate positive effects of PA interventions in middle to older age 
have been identified through systematic reviews (Conn, Hafdahl, & Mehr, 2011 ; Foster, 
Hillsdon, & Thorogood, 2005 ). Extending this evidence base , we conducted a systematic 
review with meta -analyses to quantify the longer -term effects  (≥12 months)  according to  the 
method of PA assessment and the duration of follow -up, and concluded that there is evidence 
for improvements in PA in adults aged 55 to 70 years at 12 months but not beyond (Hobbs et al 
2013).  However, like other reviews  of behavioural interventions  (Dombrowski et al., 2012 ; 
Michie, Abraham, Whittin gton, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ), our review identified moderate to 
high le vels of heterogeneity in effect , which begs the question of what factors may be 
moderating the effects .  
Behavioural interventions  are complex and typically contain multiple, varying features  and 
components, and it has been suggested that these features may help to explain the observed 
heterogeneity . To explore whether these  features moderate the intervention effects identified by 
systematic reviews, one first needs to reliably identify the features which were used in each 
intervention. Development of  taxonomies of behaviour change  techniques (BCTs)  (Abraham & 
Michie, 2008 ; Michie et al., 2011 ; Michie et al., 2013 ) has provided a framework to reliably 
code the content of behavioural interventions . In addition to syn thesising the evidence for 
interventions that target a particular health behaviour in a particular population, health 
psychology research has also utilised BCT taxonomies to investigate the  moderating effects of  
individual and empirically or theoretically derived clusters of  intervention features  (Bird et al., 
 
5 
 2013 ; Dombrowski et al., 2012 ; Dusseldorp, van Genugten, van Buuren, Verheijden, & van 
Empelen, 2013 ; Greaves et al., 2011 ; Michie et al., 2009 ; Taylor, Conner, & Lawton, 2012 ; 
Webb, Joseph, Yardley, & Michie, 2010 ). Consequently evidence is accumulating for the most 
and least effective intervention features , in turn, inform ing the devel opment of future 
interventions  (Michie & Johnston, 2012 ). However, a debate exists surrounding the methods 
used to synthesise the evidence of the impact of behavioural features, such as BCTs  (Michie, 
Johnson, & Johnston, 2014 ; Peters, de Bruin, & Crutzen, 2013 ). In particular, ensuring that 
analyses consider and account for  the concurrence of BCTs  (i.e., the simultaneous use of  more 
than one BCT  in an intervention)  has been highlighted  due to the potentially synergistic effects 
of combinations of BCTs . 
In addition to the potential moderating role of BCTs on intervention effectiveness, the mode of 
intervention delivery may also play an important role. Intervention modes of delivery , in terms 
of the provider, format, setting and intensity , can be coded in line with guidance on the 
minimal intervention characteristics that should be reported in public health interventions 
(Davidson et al., 2003 ). 
This systematic review synthesises evidence for long -term ef fects of PA interventions in adults 
aged 55 to 70 years. The aims of the analyses are twofold: 1) to identify the co ncurrence and 
potential inter -relationships between  intervention features (modes of delivery  and BCTs ); and 
2) to explore association s between intervention features and intervention effect ivenes s.  
 
Method  
Study selection criteria and search strategy  
This systematic review adhered  to a registered protocol  (Hobbs et al., 2011 ). Full details of the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the search strategy  are provided in an earlier paper  
report ing intervention effects according to PA outcomes and duration of follow -up assessment  
(Hobbs et al., 2013 ). Briefly we included RCTs of interventions assessing and reporting PA 
 
6 
 behaviour ≥12 months after ra ndomization. Interventions were compared with no intervention, 
minimal intervention or usual care control comparisons. Included trials studied free-living, 
healthy participants or those ‘at risk’ of chronic disease with a mean or median age of 55 to 70 
years . Publications of any language with an English language abstract and from one of the 
‘most developed countries’ within the United Nations index  (United Nations Development 
Program, 2011 ) were considered for inclusion.  Trials of participants recruited on the basis of 
taking a particular medication or with a pre -existing chronic or acute medical condition  were 
excluded . Trials of l aboratory -based exercise, performance training  and those that reported 
physiological rather than behav ioural measures of PA were also excluded.  Twelve electronic 
databases were searched for articles published between January 2000 and November 2010  
using s earch terms relating to PA, middle - to older -aged people and RCT  (see supplementary 
file 1 for OVID Med line search strategy) . Title, abstract and full text screening was conducted 
independently by two reviewers  and, when necessary, in consultation with a third reviewer . 
Reference lists of included publications and reviews of PA interventions were searched f or 
additional publications.    
Data extraction  
Outcome d ata from each included publication were extracted by one reviewer and 
independently checked by another  (Kappa = 0.86); a third reviewer was consulted to resolve 
discrepancies. Authors were contacted for missing data and additional published and 
unpublished intervention materials, manuals and descriptions to facilitate the accuracy of 
coding intervention features.  
The following intervention features were coded: BCTs employed and  modes of delivery 
(intervention provider, format, setting and intensity  (Davidson et al., 2003 )). The CALO -RE 
taxonomy of BCTs (Michie et al., 2011 ) was used to code BCTs as it was specifically 
developed for use with PA and dietary interventions. The presence of each of the 40 BCTs was 
judged against each BCT definition provided in the taxonomy. When interventions addressed 
 
7 
 lifestyle behaviours, such as diet or smoking, in addition to PA behaviour, then only BCTs that 
were specific to changing PA were coded as present. BCTs in the control conditions were also 
coded. To isolate the effect of an individual BCT as part of the intervention, if a BCT was 
identified in both the in tervention and control conditions, then the BCT was only coded as 
being present in the intervention when it was used in a more intensive way than in the control 
condition. That is , the BCT was coded when it was used in a longer total period of active 
intervention contact and/or administered using more intensive, active modes of delivery (e.g. 
face-to-face rather than in printed material). Where the theoretical basis of the design or 
delivery of the intervention was stated, the theory/model(s) used were extr acted.  
Intervention intensity was coded in terms of  the length of the intervention period and the 
number of intervention contacts . The intervention period was defined as beginning  when 
participants were first exposed to the intervention (i.e., when the first intervention contact 
occurred) and ending when the intervention finished (i.e., after the last intervention contact 
occurred). Intervention contacts included sessions to boost o r promote maintenance of 
intervention effects but not those where only s tudy outcomes  were assessed . The intervention  
features of each included trial were coded independently by two of three  reviewers , all of  
whom had been trained to code by one of the authors of the taxonomy and were  experience d 
using the approach in other  systematic reviews  (NH, SMcD  & VAS ) (Kappa = 0.88);  
discrepancies were resolved in consultation with the other reviewer .  
Trial  quality was assessed usin g the Cochrane risk of bias tool (Higgins & Green, 2011 ). For 
each of the seven bias criteria (adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding 
(participants, personnel and assessors), incomplete outcome data addressed and  free of 
selective outcome reporting) trials  were categorized as low  risk of bias scoring  0, or unclear or 
high risk of bias sc oring  1. Therefore, a n overall score from  0 to 7 was calculated for each trial , 
with higher scores indicating  greater  risk of bias . 
Data Analysis  
 
8 
 The effect of interventions on PA behaviour when compared with the control condition was 
examined. To identify the potential moderating effects of intervention features , data reported at 
the follow -up time point which occurred  immediately at the end of the intervention period were  
used for meta -analyses.  
If trials assessed PA using multiple methods, then data collected objectively rather than by self-
report, on total PA rather than  specific PA domains and reported as  duration rather than 
metabolic equivalents  were used for analyses . When  a trial reported PA both on a continuous 
and a dichotomous measure , the continuous measure was used for analysis to maximise 
statistical power and retain more  information about the construct. Data from intention -to-treat 
analyses were used when reported.  
When trials reported change scores from baseline, final values were computed where possible 
or requested from authors. When only the median and range values we re reported, mean and 
standard deviation values were requested from authors. When mean and standard deviation 
values were unavailable, missing data were imputed using the median instead of the mean and 
by estimating the standard deviation from the standard  error, inter -quartile range or range  
(Higgins & Green, 2011 ; Hozo, Djulbegovic, & Hozo, 2005 ). 
The following rules were applied when  trials had multiple intervention arms: the PA 
intervention arm was compared with the control condition  when the other intervention arm 
targeted diet; and the most intensive PA intervention arm was compared with the control 
condition  when the other intervention  arms also targeted PA. The most intensive intervention 
was defined as the intervention  which included the  most  intervention contacts , modes of 
intervention delivery or BCTs . 
Standardis ed mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios with 95%  confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calc ulated for all trials . Results  were pooled using a random effects model  (inverse -
variance approach based on weighted SMDs and odds ratios) using RevMan software (version 
5.1) (Review Manager, 2011 ). Random effects models  were used to estimate the mean of a 
 
9 
 distribution of effects across the included tria ls of behavioural interventions. B y their very 
nature , such interventions  are heterogeneous in terms of modes of delivery and content (BCTs).  
Trials with d ichotomous outcomes were merged with trials  with continuous outcomes using 
Comprehensive Meta -Analysis software  (CMA)  (version 2.2 ) (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & 
Rothstein, 2005 ) to produce SMDs for each trial, which are equivalent to C ohen’s d (Cohen, 
1988 ).  
The Cochran Q test was used to investigate the presence or absence of statistical heterogeneity 
(i.e., true differences) in effect sizes across trials. The I2 test statistic was used to indicate the 
percentage of total variation explained by any identified heterogeneity (Higgins & Green, 
2011 ). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings when trials 
with missing d ata, high attrition and/or high risk of bias were removed from the analysis. As 
previously reported (Hobbs et al., 2013 ), there was no statistical evidence that publication bias 
affected the results.   
Exploratory analyses of the concurrence  of intervention features were conducted using 
incidence and concurrence matrices developed using Minitab (version 17). The incidence 
matrix showed whether each intervention feature (modes of delivery and BCTs) was used or 
not used in each inclu ded trial. The concurrence matrix, which is the transpose of the incidence 
matrix multiplied by the incidence matrix1, showed how often each feature was used together 
with any other feature, i.e., the concurrence or co -occurrence of pairs of features. Individual  
intervention feature s were  included in the se exploratory analyse s only when they  had been 
used in at least 25% of included trials but not more than 75% . These cut -offs were used to  
ensure there was sufficient variability in the number of trials where each intervention feature 
                                                           
1 An incidence matrix shows the relationship between two factors, which in this case is each trial and each 
intervention feature. The incidence matrix uses ‘1’ to show when a featu re was used in a trial and ‘0’ to show 
when a feature was not used. This matrix is multiplied by its transpose (i.e., where the incidence matrix rows are 
interchanged with columns) which produces the concurrence matrix.  
 
10 
 was coded as present or absent for  the analyses . The percentage of trials employing  all possible 
combinations of pairs of intervention features was calculated.   
Random effects subgroup  analyses with Q statistic tests of subgroup differences were 
conducted using C MA software. These univariate moderator analyses were applied to 
investigate the association between  use of  specific intervention features and intervention 
effectiveness . Trials were further categorised as lower or higher risk of bias using a median 
cut-off split of the overall risk of bias score (median = 5). Random effects u nivariate meta -
regression analysis  was conducted to explore whether  the number of BCTs and the number of 
self-regulatory BCTs employed in each intervention was associated with intervention 
effectiveness.   
 
Results  
Nineteen trials were included in the meta -analysis. The number of publications included and 
excluded at each stage, and reasons for exclusion  are shown in supplementary file 2 . 
Supplementary file 3 displays the characteristics of included trials, which includes  information 
on the study population;  PA outcome data and assessment time ; attrition rates ; intervention  
materials coded  in addition to the text in the publication ; modes of delivery and BCTs used in 
the intervention and control conditions ; and risk of bias score . In total, trials r eported on 10,423 
participants with a mean age of 60.7 years (SD = 6; range 55.0 to 67.6) and 64% of whom were 
female . Trials were conducted in the USA , Europe, New Zealand, Japan, Australia and Canada.  
Modes of Delivery  
A detailed description of the intervention modes of delivery is reported in our earlier 
publication  (Hobbs et al., 2013 ). In summary, the majority of intervention providers  were 
health care professionals  (16 of 19) , one intervention was delivered by the participant under 
instruction, and the intervention provider was unclear in the remaining two trials. The majority 
of interventions (16 of 19) were , at least in part,  delivered on a face -to-face basis  on an 
 
11 
 individual and/or group basis. Eleven of the trials with a face -to-face component were also 
delivered using printed materials and/or the telephone. The three trials  with no face -to-face 
component were  delivered via printed material, the internet and /or the telephone.  Fourteen 
trials were delivered in a home setting , at least in part , because they were delivered wholly or 
in part over the telephone  or internet.  On average, the intervention period, including  the 
principal intervention and  any maintenance intervention period, was 11  months ( SD = 7.2 ; 
range 1 to 24) with 29  contacts (SD = 42 ; range 1  to 164 ).  
Behaviour Change Techniques  
A mean of 9 BCTs per intervention was coded (SD = 6; range 1 to 29). The most common 
BCTs used were behavioural  goal setting (n=13), self-monitoring of behaviour  (n=13), graded 
tasks (n=11), feedback  (n=11), barrier identification  (n=10) and information on consequences 
of behaviour to the individual  (n=10). Interventions for which additional intervention material 
was provided by authors (n=7) had a mean of 13 BCTs coded compared with 7 BCTs in 
interventions for which additional materials were not provided.  
Theoretical Basis of the Intervention  
Ten tr ials reported employing one or more behaviour change theory or model to design and/or 
deliver the intervention. The most common theories or models reported were the 
Transtheoretical Model (n=7) and Social Cognitive Theory (n=4).  
Overall T rial Effectivenes s  
The included trials reported PA outcomes as dichotomous measures (n= 3) and continuous 
measures (n=16). Data reported at 12 month post -randomisation follow -up time point were 
used for 14 trials , data at 18 month follow -up time point for two trials, data at 24 month 
follow -up time point for two trials, and data at 36 month follow -up for one trial. Comparing 
intervention and control conditions, a small positive effect was identified in favour of the 
intervention s (Figure 1 : SMD=0.29 , 95% CI =0.19 to 0 .40, k=19). Statistical heterogeneity was 
high with an I2 of 79.8% and a Q -value  of 89.16 (df=18 , p<0.01).

Sensitivity analysis remov ing trials for which  missing mean and standard deviation  values 
were imputed or estimated reduced the size of t he intervention effect (SMD=0.21, 95% 
CI=0.13 to 0.28 , k=15) and heterogeneity ( I2 = 54.9%, Q =31.07 ( df=14, p<0.01)). However, 
sensitivity analysis  removing additional trials with attrition rates over 30%  and/or high risk of 
bias did not alter the effect size (SMD=0. 22, 95% CI=0.13  to 0.31 , k=12) or heterogeneity ( I2 = 
59.1%, Q =26.92 ( df=11, p<0.01)) any further  (see supplementary file 3 for data on trials with 
missing data, high attrition and/or high risk of bias ).   
Exploratory  Concurrence and Moderator Analyses of I ntervention F eatures  
Each  feature included in the exploratory  analyse s had been coded as present  in at least 25% of 
trials  (5 of 19) but not more than 75% (15 of 19) . Thus, the following BCTs were not included: 
shaping , anticipate d regret , fear arousal , self-talk, imagery , stress management , time 
management , communication skills  and anticipation of future rewards  (n=0); information 
about others’ approval , reward effort , prompt generalisation , behavioural contract  and 
identification as role model  (n=1); focus on past success  and environmental restructuring  
(n=2); information on consequences of behaviour in general  and reward success  (n=3); 
normative information , action planning , review outcome goals , prompts/cues , social 
comparison , relapse prevention  and motivational interviewing  (n=4). The following modes of 
delivery were also excluded from analysis due to a lack of variability in occurrence: health 
professional as intervention provider (n=16) and internet as intervention format (n=2).  
Concurrence of Features  
Using the included intervention features, i ncidence and concurrence matrices were developed 
to explore how often each intervention feature was coded as being used  and how often it 
occurred in combination with another  (Table 1 ). The percentage of trials employing all possible 
combinations of pairs of intervention features was calculated as an indication of concurrence .  
 
13 
 Table 1  about here  
 
One hundred percent of the time, all i nterventions that used the BCT outcome goal setting were 
delivered at home, whilst all interventions that used the BCT barrier identification  also used 
the BCT self-monitoring of behaviour . When the BCT behavioural goal review  was used, the 
interventions were always delivered at home  and used the BCTs behavioural goal setting  and 
follow -up prompts . When the BCT model /demonstrate the  behaviour  was used, the 
interventions always used the BCTs graded tasks  and instruction on how to perform the 
behaviour . When the BCT prompt practice  was used, interventions also always  used the BCT 
graded tasks . Finally, w hen the BCT follow -up prompts  was used, interventions also always 
used the BCT behavioural goal setting . All interventions that were delivered on the telephone 
were also coded as being delivered at  home, at least in part .  
Table 2 about here  
 
Moderating Effects of BCTs used  
Table 2  displays which  intervention features were used in each of the included trials . Trials are 
ordered from most to least effective using the trial SMD. The trial sample size and risk of bias 
(high or low) are also presented.  Modes of delivery and BCTs are grouped separately. 
Subgroup analyses comparing the effect size estimate for interv entions using each feature 
compared with interventions not using the feature are presented. Features are ordered within 
their respective group of modes of delivery or BCTs by the size of the difference in effect size 
estimate between interventions using an d not using each feature. Use of t he BCT feedback  was 
the only feature found to be associated with being more effective ; interventions using feedback 
were significantly more effective than interventions that did not use feedback  (Q=4.14, 
p=0.042).  In contrast, interventions  that used printed materials  as mode of delivery , and the 
BCTs information on where and when to perform the behaviour , and information on 
consequences of behaviour to the individual  were found to be associated with being less 
 
14 
 effective  (printed materials: Q=9.47, p=0.002; information on where and when to perform the 
behaviour: Q=6.06, p=0.014; and information on consequences of behaviour to the individual:  
Q=10.52, p=0.001). 
Moderating Effects of the Number of BCT s used 
Univariate meta -regression analysis found no significant association between the number of 
BCTs used and intervention effectiveness (beta = -0·003, 95%CI: -0.009 to -0.002; Q = 1.32 
(df=1, p=0·25)). BCTs intrinsic to self -regulation theory (goal setting, g oal review , self-
monitoring , feedback ) were  some of the most commonly coded BCTs in interventions ; 
therefore , the association between the number of self -regulatory BCTs used and intervention 
effectiveness  was also explored; univariate meta -regression analysis found no significant 
association (beta = 0·012, 95%CI: -0.025  to 0.0 49; Q = 0.42 (df=1, p>0·05)).  
 
Discussion  
This systematic review  and meta -analysis  is the first to explore the concurrence  and 
moderating effects of intervention features within  19 RCTs promoting  long-term (≥12 months) 
PA behaviour in adults aged 55 to 70 years . Using standardised and reliable methods to code 
the intervention features of BCTs (Michie et al., 2011 ) and modes of delivery (Davidson et al., 
2003 ), we identified feature  conc urrence  and found that many features were not used in 
isolation but occurred in combination . Particular features were associated with intervention 
effectiveness but the total number of BCTs or  the number of self -regulatory BCTs  did not 
moderate effects .  
Findings in C ontext  and Implications  
There was no evidence that intervention setting is important for effectiveness; neither a 
healthcare or home setting were associated with effectiveness, which is in line with other 
findings from PA interventions (Greaves et al., 2011 ). The lack of  a dose response relationship 
between the  total number of BCTs used in interventions and intervention effectiveness is also 
 
15 
 not a novel finding. The meta -analyses by Dombrowski et al  (2012 ) and Taylor et al (2012 ) 
similarly concluded that using more BCTs does not  necessarily lead to improved effectiveness.   
The potentially moderating effect of the number of self-regulatory BCTs was also tested but 
again no association was identified. Evidence for the role of self -regulatory techniques is 
mixed. P articular clusters of BCTs taken from self -regulation theory have been shown to be  
associated with PA intervention effectiveness  (Greaves et al., 2011 ; Michie et al., 2011 ). 
Conversely, self-regulatory BCTs have been shown to be  associated with lower levels of PA  in 
interventions in older adults  (French, Olander, Chisholm, & Mc Sharry, 2014 ). Our univariate 
moderator analyses found  that use of the self -regulatory BCT  feedback  was associated with 
more  effective  interventions , which has been reported previously (Dombrowski et al., 2012 ; 
Greaves et al., 2011 ; Michie et al., 2009 ). The BCT feedback  is defined in the CALO -RE 
taxonomy  as providing the person with data about their own recorded behaviour  (follow ing the 
BCT self-monitoring of behaviour ) or commenting on discrepancies between a person’s 
behavioural performance and goals (link ing with the BCT behavioural goal setting ). Our 
concurrence analyses  showed  that feedback  did not occur in combination  with either  of these 
BCTs  100% of the time;  however,  all 11 interventions which used feedback  also used at least 
one of these other self-regulatory techniques . If the BCT feedback  is related to more effective 
interventions  but always concurs with at least one other self -regulatory technique , then the 
possible combined effects  of self -regulatory techniques need to be further investigated.  
Debate about methods used to synthesise evidence of the impact of behavioural features, such 
as BCTs (Michie et al., 2014 ; Peters et al., 2013 ), highlights  the importance of analyses which 
consider , and account for , the concurrence  of BCTs. If BCTs are coded as being used togethe r 
in a given intervention, then conclusions based on univariate meta -regression analyses of the 
association between discrete BCTs and intervention effectiveness  (Dombrowski et al., 2012 ; 
Taylor et al., 2012 ) may be confounded by the fact that the BCT was not used in isolation. For 
example, the moderator analyses in the present review revealed that interventio ns using printed 
 
16 
 materials  were  less effective . However, t he concurrence analyses  show ed that seven of  the 
eight  interventions  that used printed materials  also used the BCT information on consequences 
of behaviour to the individual , which was also shown to be less effective . Thus, it is possible 
that the presence or magnitude of the identified negative  moderating effect of using printed 
materials  is not true but rather a confound due to the BCT  information on consequences of 
behaviour to the individual  being  used at the same time  in 88% of possible cases . In fact, the 
BCT information on consequences of behaviour has previously been identified as a negative 
moderator  of PA behaviour change ; less effective PA interventions were associated with use of 
the technique  (Dombrowski et al., 2012 ). 
The other BCT  shown to negatively moderate intervention effectiveness was the BCT  
information on where and when to perform the behaviour . This finding replicates that found by 
French et al (2014 ) in their review of BCTs associated with PA in older adults. This finding is 
counter -intuitive since one would anticipate  that knowing about possible opportunities to be  
more physically active  would be helpful  in doing so . It is noted however, that the exploratory, 
post hoc nature of th ese moderator analyses means that spurious or chance findings are a 
possibility and therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution . Nonetheless, the 
findings can be used to generate hypotheses for future research  about which BCTs may be 
more or less effective. Such hypotheses can be used  to inform the design of interventions 
where the effectiveness of particular intervention features can be investigated. For example, 
factorial trials would be a useful design through which intervention features could be 
investigated systematically to help isolate the effects of individual and combinations of BCTs. 
Moreover, with advances in statistical approaches to understand the combined effects of BCTs 
in interventions  (Dusseldorp et al. , 2013 ), future analyses based  on evidence with sufficient 
statistical power have  the potential to allow more sensitive analyses of BCT synergistic effects.  
This review  focused on the long -term effectiveness of physical activity interventions and  only 
included trials with at least a 12 -month follow -up. This focus may help to explain some of the 
 
17 
 discrepancies between the BCTs identified as being associated with effectiveness in  this review 
and those identified in other reviews of the effectiveness of BCTs  on physical activity , which 
considered shorter term outcomes (e.g.,Bélanger -Gravel, Godin, & Amireault, 2011 ). It is 
worth highlighting, therefore, that together with evidence on the  determinants of physical 
activity maintenance  (Amireault, Godin, & Vézina -Im, 2012 ), the findings  in this review are 
particularly informative for the design of in terventions with potential long -term effectiveness .  
Strengths and Limitations  
The coding of intervention features was conducted using reliable methods and a standardised 
and appropriate BCT taxonomy, the 40 -item CALO -RE taxonomy which was specifically 
developed for use with PA and dietary interventions  (Michie et al., 2011 ). BCT s were coded by 
health psychologists trained and experienced in coding intervention features, yielding high 
inter-rater reliability  (Kappa = 0.88) . Where possible, intervention f eatures were coded using 
all available intervention materials provided by authors. Noticeably, approximately twice as 
many BCTs were coded in trials for which additional intervention materials were provided 
compared with trials for which only the original publication was available . This finding mirrors 
that reported by  Lorencatto et al  (2012 ). The rigorous approach we adopt ed to code BCTs 
using whatever material was provided by authors meant that in some cases BCTs were coded 
from lengthy intervention manuals or doctoral theses, whereas in other cases BCTs were coded 
from short, concise intervention descriptions in a journal  article. As a consequence, more BCTs 
may have been coded in trials for which additional materials were available (because there was 
significantly more text from which judgements could be made), and this may have introduced a 
systematic bias in subsequent analyses. However, it may also be the case  that those trials for 
which additional material was available did use more BCTs because these interventions had 
been developed with a stronger basis in behaviour change science. With the available evidence, 
we can not distinguish between these alternatives. Developments in open access publishing 
including widespread availability of  supplementary online files, the advent of journal policies 
 
18 
 that require authors to provide intervention manuals with the article , and g uidance for the 
reporting of interventions  (Hoffmann et al., 2014 ) are likely to diminish the adverse effects of  
article word limits . Future systematic reviews of behaviour change interventions will then be 
able to undertake more robust investigations of differences in the n umber BCTs coded between 
trials .  
Another strength of this review was the careful consideration for the potential active content of 
no/minimal  intervention, or usual care  control conditions in the analytic strategy , which has 
been  highlighted as an important limitation in previous analyses  (Peters et al., 2013 ). A BCT 
was only coded as present in an intervention when it had not been identified in a control 
condition or when it had been used more intensively compared with the control condition. This 
approach was adop ted to isolate the effect of an individual BCT as a unique feature of the 
intervention.   
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our meta -analysis findings . Even though the 
size of the intervention effect  was reduced by the removal of  trials for which missing data had 
been estimated  or those with a higher risk of bias  (i.e., SMD of 0.29 reduced to 0.21 and 0.22 
respectively) , the significance of the positive effect  of interventions was retained . Nonetheless, 
the association s between in tervention features and effectiveness can be further interpreted  in 
light of trial risk of bias . As presented in Table 2, the trial by Babazono (2007 ) is the most 
effective  trial with a low risk of bias . The intervention in this trial used the BCT  feedback , 
which was shown to be associated with more effective interventions in the m oderator analyses, 
but did not use printed materials  or the BCTs information on where and when to perform the 
behaviour  and information on consequences of behaviour to the individ ual, which were shown 
to be associated with less effective interventions.  However, the trial by Hertogh (2010) , which 
was the most effective trial in the review , similarly used feedback  but not  printed materials  or 
the BCTs information on where and when to  perform the behaviour  and information on 
consequences of behaviour to the individual ; yet this trial  was rated as  high risk of bias as the 
 
19 
 method s of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding could not be ascertained  from 
the publication. It may be the case that  the robustness of the identified moderating role of 
particular intervention features is unaffected by trial bias  in the same way as was seen in the 
sensitivity analysis of the main meta -analyses. Nevertheless, both  of these  trials  have limited 
sample sizes and th erefore the overall  findings would need to be replicat ed in larger trial s.  
A limitation of this review is that the findings are only applicable to interventions conducted 
with participants in countries categorised as being  one of the ‘most developed countries’ within 
the United Nations index (United Nations Development Program, 2011 ); therefore, their 
generalisability to lower income countries needs to be ascertained.  
A possible limitation of the meta -analysis is that in order to examine the potential moderating 
role of intervention features on effectiveness, all included trials were aggregated regardless of 
the way in which the PA behavioural outcome was measured  (objectively or self -report ed). 
Inaccurate recall and social desirability may result in self -reported measures of PA being over - 
or under -estimated (Kowalski, Rhodes, Naylor, Tuokko, & MacDonald, 2012 ) which means 
that the intervention effectiveness of a trial reporting object ive measures of PA using  
accelerometry data may not be comparable with that of a trial using self -reported data. In our 
earlier paper from this systematic review  (Hobbs et al., 2013 ), we conducted meta -analyses 
according to the metho d of PA assessment and the duration of follow -up and concluded that 
when compared with controls at 12 months, interventions had a larger positive effect on 
pedometer measured step -count (SMD = 1.09, n=4) than on self -reported continuous outcomes 
(SMD = 0.19, n=11) or self -reported dichot omous outcomes (OR = 1.63, n=3). This suggests 
that self -reported measures may underestimate intervention effects ; however t his explanation 
warrants further enquiry.   
Despite our attempt to explore co ncurrence of BCTs and  modes of delivery, our analyses were 
limited by the relatively small number of trials. Multivariate analyses of combinations and 
clusters of BCTs could not be conducted due to a lack of statistical power; thus, co ncurrence of 
 
20 
 features in pairs only was co nducted. Another  limitation  that should be noted is that the 
reliability of our findings is dependent on intervention fidelity  in terms of whether the 
intervention features coded are a true reflection of what actually occurred in the intervention . 
Fidelity checks would allow knowledge to be gathered about whether the intervention was 
delivered as planned, the extent to which the features were delivered , and the quality of 
delivery thereof . Only two trials reported on the independent assessment of i ntervention 
fidelity through audio and video recordings (Harting et al., 2006 ; King et al., 2007 ) and 
therefore this issue cannot be examined  further.  
Replication of these findings is needed when  a larger set of trials is available. The intricacies of 
the moderating role of individual and clusters of particular intervention features on long -term 
effectiveness should be further scrutinised alongside data  on feature concurrence. Moreover, 
the moderating roles of theory  in intervention design  and multiple behaviour  focus  (i.e., 
interventions targeting other behaviours in addition to PA) are additional hypotheses that could 
be explored in a larger data set .  
Conclusion  
The long -term e ffectiveness of PA interventions in middle to older age adults was not 
associated with the total number of BCTs or the number of self -regulatory BCTs used. 
Moderator analyses suggested that interventions aiming to promote PA in this population 
should consider using the BCT feedback in order to enhance effects. However, m any pairs of 
intervention features were used in concurrence making it difficult  to isolate  the effects of 
specific BCTs unambiguously .

Note . Trials are ordered from most to least effective using the SMD. Modes of delivery and behaviour change techniques are grouped  separately. 
Within each group, features are o rdered from left to right by the size of the difference in effect size estimate (SMD) between  intervention s using  
and not using each feature.
