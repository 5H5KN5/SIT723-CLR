Abstract
Background: Adapting interventions that have worked elsewhere can save resources associated with developing
new interventions for each specific context. While a developing body of evidence shows benefits of adapted
interventions compared with interventions transported without adaptation, there are also examples of interventions
which have been extensively adapted, yet have not worked in the new context. Decisions on when, to what extent,
and how to adapt interventions therefore are not straightforward, particularly when conceptualising intervention
effects as contingent upon contextual interactions in complex systems. No guidance currently addresses these
questions comprehensively. To inform development of an overarching guidance on adaptation of complex
population health interventions, this systematic review synthesises the content of the existing guidance papers.
Methods: We searched for papers published between January 2000 and October 2018 in 7 bibliographic databases.
We used citation tracking and contacted authors and experts to locate further papers. We double screened all the
identified records. We extracted data into the following categories: descriptive information, key concepts and
definitions, rationale for adaptation, aspects of adaptation, process of adaptation, evaluating and reporting adapted
interventions. Data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers, and retrieved data were synthesised
thematically within pre-specified and emergent categories.
Results: We retrieved 6694 unique records. Thirty-eight papers were included in the review representing 35 sources
of guidance. Most papers were developed in the USA in the context of implementing evidence-informed interventions
among different population groups within the country, such as minority populations. We found much agreement on
how the papers defined key concepts, aims, and procedures of adaptation, including involvement of key stakeholders,
but also identified gaps in scope, conceptualisation, and operationalisation in several categories.
Conclusions: Our review found limitations that should be addressed in future guidance on adaptation .Specifically,
future guidance needs to be reflective of adaptations in the context of transferring interventions across countries,
including macro- (e.g. national-) level interventions, better theorise the role of intervention mechanisms and contextual
interactions in the replicability of effects and accordingly conceptualise key concepts, such as fidelity to intervention
functions, and finally, suggest evidence-informed strategies for adaptation re-evaluation and reporting.

Background
Population health interventions comprise a spectrum of
interventions, programmes, and policies in public health
and health services research that seek to change the
population distribution of risk [ 1]. This includes inter-
ventions delivered to whole populations (e.g. regulatory
restrictions on alcohol sales), and interventions targeting
defined sub-populations (e.g. based on age), or specific
groups with increased levels of risk (e.g. brief alcohol
interventions for harmful drinkers or health service in-
terventions to prevent obesity [ 1]). Increasingly, inter-
ventions are seen as interacting with the complex
systems into which they are introduced [ 2–4]. From this
systems perspective, all interventions can be conceptua-
lised as complex, as they operate through active context-
ual interactions, influence and are influenced by
mechanisms of the entire system [ 3].
Implementing interventions that have worked elsewhere
(we refer to these as evidence-informed interventions) can
save human and financial resources associated with build-
ing evidence de novo for each context. However, this often
involves implementing an intervention in systems with
different norms, resources, and delivery structures to the
original context. While there are examples of complex
population health interventions that have successfully
been transferred to new contexts [ 5,6], others have been
ineffective [ 7,8], or even harmful [ 9,10]. Potential reasons
for transferability failure include contextual disparities,
local adaptations which compromise important interven-
tion functions, or different evaluation methods in the
original and new contexts [ 11].
Context can be thought of as a set of characteristics
and circumstances that consist of active and unique fac-
tors within which the implementation of an intervention
is embedded [ 12]. Intervention effects are generatedthrough interaction of new ways of working with exist-
ing contexts [ 13]. When implementing interventions in a
new context, adaptation and re-evaluation is often re-
quired to be confident that the intervention will achieve
the same benefits as in the original study. Simultaneous
recognition of the value of using evidence from else-
where, and the need to adapt interventions to achieve fit
within new contexts, has stimulated research on the im-
plementation and/or re-evaluation of evidence-informed
interventions in new contexts.
A number of papers, including editorials and case
studies, have been published in recent years providing
recommendations on how to adapt interventions for
new contexts [ 11,14]. However, few attempts have been
made to systematise them [ 15], and no overarching and
consensus-based guidance is currently available. Further-
more, there are debates in the field on how to define
and operationalise important concepts, such as adapta-
tion and fidelity. For example, Stirman et al. define adap-
tations based on the targets of modification [ 16]: (i)
modifications made to the content of the intervention
and its implementation; (ii) modifications made to the
context; and (iii) modifications made to procedures for
intervention evaluation [ 16]. In the meantime, Resnicow
et al. suggest defining adaptations based on degrees of
modification: modifications made to observable charac-
teristics of the intervention (i.e. surface structures) and
those made to the underlying psycho-social and environ-
mental factors (i.e. deep structures). Different ap-
proaches have also been put forward regarding “fidelity ”.
Implementation fidelity has commonly been conceptua-
lised as delivery of a (manualised) intervention as
intended by developers [ 17]. Proponents of complex sys-
tems thinking, however, have suggested alternatively de-
fining fidelity as retaining important functions (i.e. the
mechanisms and theoretical principles) of the interven-
tion while allowing adaptations to form (i.e. specific con-
tent and delivery) of the intervention [ 18].
The ADAPT Study has been funded to develop an
evidence-informed and consensus-based guidance for
adapting complex population health interventions to
new contexts [ 11,19]. Commensurate with best prac-
tices in guidance development [ 20], the ADAPT Study
follows a phased process, incorporating existing meth-
odological knowledge through literature reviews and ex-
pert consultations, as well as the use of consensus
development methods. A comprehensive literature re-
view serves to consolidate existing knowledge on the
topic, notably the spectrum of necessary considerations,
and to identify relevant stakeholder groups to consult.
This systematic review has thus been designed as the
first stage of a broader guidance development to synthe-
sise existing recommendations on adaptation and inform
the further phases of the study, including qualitativeContributions to the literature

health often relies on evidence from a different context.

interviews with key stakeholders and an international
Delphi panel [ 11].
We found only one recent scoping review of adapta-
tion frameworks in public health [ 15], which maps exist-
ing recommendations on adaptation. However, the
review only focuses on key steps described in the frame-
works and does not provide in-depth analysis of import-
ant concepts and strategies in adaptation or assess
approaches to intervention re-evaluation in new con-
texts; nor does it extend to health services research. To
address this gap, the present systematic review aims to
provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing guidance
on intervention adaptation in relation to (i) key con-
cepts, (ii) the rationale for adaptation, (iii) different types
of adaptations, (iv) the processes recommended for con-
ducting intervention adaptation, and (v) methodological
approaches suggested to re-evaluate and (vi) report the
adapted intervention.
Methods
The systematic review was conducted in accordance
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see
Additional file 1for completed PRISMA checklist) [ 21].
The review protocol was pre-registered in PROSPERO
(CRD42018112714) and the Open Science Framework
(osf.io/wn5f8).
Search strategy
We designed the search strategy iteratively in consult-
ation with information specialists to achieve balance be-
tween sensitivity and specificity so that the search would
retrieve all pre-identified eligible studies and yield a
manageable number of studies to screen. We ran the
searches on October 12, 2018 in the following databases:
Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts (ASSIA),
Conference Proceedings Citation Index –Social Science
& Humanities (CPCI-SSH), Dissertations and Theses
Global: The Humanities and Social Sciences Collection,
EMBASE, MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In-
Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and
Versions, PsycINFO, and Social Science Citation Index
(SSCI). We used citation tracking (backward and for-
ward in Google Scholar) of all included studies and con-
tacted authors and international experts to locate further
studies and updates (see Additional file 2for the search
strategy).
Eligibility criteria
To be included, a document had to be full-length and
provide recommendations on how to adapt and/or re-
evaluate interventions in new contexts. We define full-
length documents as those with substantive narrative,
such as research, analysis, methodological papers, ordissertations, theses, and book chapters. We did not
consider commentaries, abstracts, information available
on web-pages, and conference proceedings without a
link to a full report as full-length documents. To include
a range of perspectives, we did not limit the review
scope to only those papers that described a formal
process of guidance development, but rather included all
papers that described recommendations for practice. Pa-
pers providing only conceptual discussion on or exam-
ples of intervention adaptation without explicit
recommendations for practice were not included; these
were saved in a separate category during data screening
for consideration in a related scoping review on “cases
of adaptation ”(Open Science Framework registration:
osf.io/udzma). Further inclusion criteria were as follows:
(i) focus on public health and/or health service interven-
tions rather than on specific clinical procedures, such as
surgery, (ii) publication from 2000 onwards, as this was
when discussions on evidence-informed interventions
and their adaptation came to the fore [ 15,22], (iii) publi-
cation in English, German, French, Italian, Russian, or
Swedish, as these languages could be comprehensively
covered by the project team members. Table 1provides
further clarifications for the eligibility criteria.
Study selection
Results were imported into the Endnote reference man-
agement software and de-duplicated. One reviewer (AM)
screened publications on title level and removed clearly
irrelevant retrievals using the eligibility criteria in Table
1. Two reviewers (shared among AM, BH, LA, and LP)
independently screened the titles and abstracts of the
remaining records followed by full-text screening (AM
and LA). Disagreements or uncertainties regarding eligi-
bility were resolved by discussion among the two re-
viewers, with recourse to a third when necessary (RE).
Data screening was performed using the Rayyan web
application for systematic reviews [ 23].
Extraction
We developed the data extraction form based on the re-
view objectives (see Additional file 3). The initial form
was piloted by four reviewers (AM, ER, LA, and RE) on
two eligible papers. Uncertainties during piloting were
noted and discussed among the four reviewers to revise
and finalise the form. Two reviewers (AM and LA) then
independently extracted all data onto seven pre-specified
categories:
1. Descriptive information including publication
author, year, title, and source.
2. Key concepts of adaptation used, including
employed definitions and nomenclature.Movsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 3 of 20
3. Rationale for intervention adaptation, including why
and when adaptations should be undertaken.
4. Types and components of adaptation
5. Processes for undertaking adaptation
6. Approaches for deciding on an appropriate
methodology for re-evaluating the adapted
intervention.
7. Suggested criteria or recommendations on how to
report intervention adaptations.
Disagreements and ambiguities regarding the extrac-
tion were resolved by discussion among the two
reviewers.
Synthesis
We synthesised extracted data using procedures derived
from thematic and cross-case analyses, such as descrip-
tive coding and cross-case tabulation [ 24–26]. Thematic
analysis is widely used for analysing textual data, and in
combination with cross-case analysis facilitated examin-
ation of commonalities and differences of the content of
the guidance papers in this review [ 26]. First, we used
the seven pre-specified categories described above to
sort the data. To do this, we employed structural coding
described by Saldaña [ 24], which applies a content-based
phrase representing a topic of inquiry to large segments
of data relating to a specific research question (e.g. ra-
tionale for adaptation). Drawing on the cross-case ana-
lytical approach described by Miles and Huberman [ 25],
two reviewers (AM and LA) charted the data to examine
how data in each category were described across thepapers (e.g. how different papers described the rationale
for adaptation). For this, we employed a more inductive
and descriptive line-by-line coding. Synthesis drafts and
descriptions of each category were then developed by
two reviewers (AM and LA), examined by all authors,
and revised based on their feedback.
Quality appraisal
We assessed included papers against pre-defined cri-
teria designed by the project team drawing on related
previous work [ 12,27,28]. While papers were not ex-
cluded on the grounds of this assessment, we assigned
more interpretive weight to those with clearer concepts
and more comprehensive guidance. Included papers
were assessed against three criteria, namely practicality
(defined as understandability and clarity of key con-
structs, ease of use and comprehensiveness in terms of
coverage of adaptation and evaluation recommenda-
tions), relevance (defined in terms of applicability to
different types of interventions and by different stake-
holder groups, such as researchers and funders), and le-
gitimacy (defined as following a “formal process ”of
guidance development, such as using a literature review
and/or a consensus-based methodology). We assigned a
rating of 0 (criterion is not addressed at all), + (criter-
ion is partially addressed), or ++ (criterion is fully ad-
dressed). Two reviewers independently conducted
appraisals (AM and LA) and resolved any disagree-
ments through discussion (see Additional file 4for fur-
ther details on the criteria).Table 1 Eligibility criteria

Results
Our database searches identified 6694 unique records of
which 38 records were included in the review describing
35 guidance papers (see Fig. 1for the PRISMA flow
diagram). No additional papers were found based on
citation tracking or expert recommendations.
Characteristics of included studies
As shown in Table 2, papers varied in their topic area
and largely focused on sexual health and HIV/AIDS pre-
vention programmes ( n= 8, 23%), parenting and family-
based interventions ( n= 8, 23%), and psychotherapies ( n
= 6, 17%). Thirty-one papers (89%) described and drew
on micro-level interventions (i.e. those that focus on
intervening with individuals and their immediate social
network and relationships, such as the family) to illus-
trate the application of the guidance. Meso-level inter-
ventions (i.e. those that focus on intervening with
population groups, such as neighbourhoods, schools, orother community organisations) were discussed in five
(14%). We did not identify a paper that discussed adap-
tation of macro-level interventions (i.e. those that focus
on intervening with overarching social systems that op-
erate at the national or global level). Based on the affili-
ation of the first author, 28 papers (80%) were developed
in the USA and 24 of these discussed adaptations across
different populations within the USA (e.g. transferring
interventions to ethnic minority groups within the USA)
[29–52]. Most papers were published in peer-reviewed
journals ( n= 31, 89%) [ 29–31,33–36,38–61]; we identi-
fied 4 papers (11%) from grey literature sources, includ-
ing two book chapters [ 32,37] and two governmental
agency reports [ 62,63].
Quality of studies
With respect to practicality, we rated 21 papers as pro-
viding clear definitions of key constructs and 24 papers
as offering a well-operationalised procedure for adapting

interventions. The latter primarily involved a sequential
stepwise approach. However, we judged 21 papers as
only partially addressing the criterion of comprehensive-
ness (defined as coverage of both intervention adaptation
and re-evaluation), as they did not provide thorough
guidance on intervention re-evaluation in a new context
(see Additional file 4for detailed ratings).
We judged only six papers as fully addressing rele-
vance; the rest had a specific and narrow focus on
individual-level interventions (e.g. psychotherapy and be-
havioural interventions, see Table 2), and we down-rated
their relevance for broader health service and public
health interventions, notably policy-level interventions.
Finally, we rated 23 papers as partially addressing legit-
imacy, as they did not report a transparent and rigorous
development process, such as consulting a broader range
of stakeholders beyond the immediate author team. The
papers, however, frequently reported having conducted a
literature review or drawing on theoretical principles to
ground their approach —primarily the principles of
Roger ’s diffusion of innovations theory and community-
based participatory research (CBPR) (see Table 2).
Categories
In the following, we describe the findings of the synthe-
sis undertaken for each of the pre-defined categories.
We did not find recommendations on reporting of
adapted interventions, so this category has been omitted.
During data sorting, we identified a new category of
stakeholder involvement in adaptation.
Category 1: Key concepts and definitions
Table 3summarises key concepts and their definitions
as used in existing guidance papers. In most cases,
papers discussed concepts related to adaptation in the
background sections of the guidance by referring to pre-
viously published literature and debates [ 29,31–34,36,
43,45,49,51–54,56–59,61]. Papers commonly concep-
tualised adaptation as a systematically planned and pro-
active process of modification with the aim to fit the
intervention into a new context and enhance its accept-
ability [ 29,30,34,35,45–49,51–54,57,61,62,64]. This
approach was contrasted to unplanned modifications,
which were seen as undesirable changes happening dur-
ing intervention implementation in a real-world setting
likely to result in “intervention drift ”(see Table 3)
[29,32,36,45,54,62]. Alternative terms to adapta-
tion were suggested in some papers. Specifically, the
term reinvention , originating from diffusion of innovations
theory, was used to describe adaptations occurring at a
deeper structure level [ 57]( s e e “Category 3: Aspects of
adaptation ”section below). Nápoles and Stewart used the
term transcreation to highlight active participation of
community partners in the process [ 47].Adaptation and fidelity were commonly viewed as mu-
tually exclusive concepts. Sometimes, as remarked by
Perez et al., this paralleled a distinction between impos-
ing an intervention on the intended population versus
actively engaging with the population to bring about
change: “fidelity is underpinned by a professionally
driven or “top-down ”approach to implementation, while
adaptation seems to be closer to a user-based or “bot-
tom-up ”approach, which is more politically appealing to
promoters of social development ”[57]. Resolving the “fi-
delity-adaption ”tension was seen as one of the most
challenging tasks in intervention adaptation and was de-
scribed as a dynamic process that requires strategic revi-
siting throughout different stages of implementation
[62]. In this light, identification of intervention core com-
ponents was highlighted as important in providing a
scope for adaptation (see Table 3). Informed by intervention
theory, which specifies the the oretical relations between an
intervention and its outcomes [ 34,45,58,62], these compo-
nents were seen to fundamental ly define the intervention
[34,45,48,59,62] and therefore not to be modified during
adaptation [ 30,45,48,52]. In contrast, modification of dis-
cretionary components was suggested to enhance an inter-
vention ’s social validity, that is the perceived acceptability
and utility of the intervention [ 45,52,58].
Category 2: Rationale and pre-requisites for adapting
interventions
Adapting evidence-informed interventions was often de-
scribed as requiring fewer human and financial resources
than newly designing and evaluating interventions in
each specific context [ 39,40,45,48,52,55,58]. As an
overarching aim of adaptation , the papers highlighted
assuring intervention salience and fit with the new
context and addressing the specific needs of the local
population [30,32,36,40,43,45,48,53,56,57,64].
Where detailed, more specific aims of adaptation in-
cluded enhancing acceptability, local commitment, sup-
port, collaboration, and ownership of the intervention
[35,42,45,49,52,54,57,62], facilitating enrolment, en-
gagement, retention, and satisfaction with the interven-
tion [ 40,42,44,49,51,54,55,57], as well as supporting
successful implementation of the intervention, its use
and sustainability [ 42,44,48,49,52,57]. Only a few pa-
pers explicitly mentioned maintaining intervention ef-
fectiveness as the direct aim of adaptation [ 49,51,53].
To inform the need for specific adaptations, a few pre-
requisite activities were described, including exploring
the theory underlying the intervention (also referred to as
programme theory and including identification of core
components, which should not be modified), examining
the generalisability of intervention effects in multiple con-
texts (such as through moderation analysis within rando-
mised controlled trials or other studies), as well asMovsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 8 of 20
assessing the extent of mismatch between the candidate
and the replication contexts , and the acceptability of the
intervention in the new context (see“Category 4: Process
of adaptation ”on the recommended procedures to as-
sess these) [ 31,32,34,42,43,50,53,56,58]. In most
cases, the process of identifying mismatch was de-
scribed as an assessment of the availability of the
resources and infrastructure in the new context (e.g. fund-
ing, staffing, and local agency capacity) [ 34,45,48,49,58],
as well as the distinctive characteristics of the new popula-
tion (e.g. age, socio-economic status, and cultural norms)
[31,33,36,37,39,47–49,56]. While these factors might
be linked to intervention theory, none of the papers expli-
citly emphasised the possible interactions of thesecontextual factors with intervention mechanisms and im-
plications of these interactions for effects in a new
context.
The level of the identified mismatch between the ori-
ginal and new contexts was generally seen to inform the
decision about which intervention to select and the ex-
tent of adaptations that might be required. As noted by
one of the papers: “if mismatches between a candidate
programme and a replication context are significant —for
example [ …] if the implementing agency does not have
and cannot obtain the resources needed to implement
the programme —the programme should probably not be
selected for implementation in one ’s site. Less significant
mismatches may, however, be successfully addressedTable 3 Key concepts and definitions
Key concept Definition
Adaptation A systematically planned and proactive process of intervention modification [ 29,30,34,35,45,47,48,51–54,57,62,64] with
the aim to suit the specific characteristics and needs of a new context and enhance intervention acceptability [ 29,30,34,35,
45,46,48,49,51,53,54,57,61,62,64].
Mutual adaptation involves adaptation of both the intervention and of the community or organisation in which the
intervention is implemented for the purposes of institutional accommodation [ 57,62].
Adaptive
interventionsThose interventions for which stakeholders are allowed, or even encouraged, to bring changes to the original design. These
changes are pre-defined by intervention developers. In the context of complex public health interventions, involving different
organisational levels and targeting collective behaviours, implementers can also make changes which are not pre-defined by
the developers [ 31,57].
Core components Those features in the intent and design of an intervention which are responsible for the effectiveness of the intervention [ 32,
34,36,41,43,45,48,49,52,62]. Guidance suggests that these components fundamentally define the intervention [ 34,43,45,
48,62] and therefore should not be modified in adaptation [ 30,45,48,52], e.g. developing a natural support system for
youth and families as part of a family-based intervention.
Alternative terms: essential, necessary, prototypical components or elements, or intervention ’s deep structure.
Discretionary
componentsThose features which are not essential for the target audience and which are not supported by the theory of change and
thus are assumed to be modifiable without major impact on intervention effectiveness [ 45,52,58,62], e.g. provision of an
additional class as part of a parenting intervention addressing trauma related to natural disasters.
Alternative terms: optional components or intervention ’s surface structure.
Drift A misapplication or a mistaken application of an intervention involving technical errors, abandonment of core components,
or introduction of counterproductive elements resulting in a loss of intervention benefits [ 29,54].
Fidelity (adherence) The degree to which an intervention is implemented as intended by its developers [ 29,47–49,54,58,59,62] with the aim to
maintain intervention ’s intended effects [ 57,58]. The components of fidelity (also dimensions for measuring fidelity) include
dose, frequency, exposure, quality of delivery, participant responsiveness, and programme differentiation [ 29,49,57,59,62].
Programme theory Refers to the causal model that specifies the empirical and theoretical relations between intervention activities, mediators of
change, and ultimate outcomes [ 34,43,45,58].
Alternative terms: theory of change, internal logic
Reinvention The degree to which an innovation (i.e. an intervention) is changed or modified by the user in the process of its adoption
and implementation [ 37,57,62].
Replication The process of re-implementing an established intervention in a new context in a way that maintains fidelity to core goals,
activities, delivery techniques, intensity, and duration of the original study [ 34].
Transcreation The processes of planning and delivering interventions so that they resonate with the targeted community, while achieving
intended health outcomes [ 47].
Scale-out The deliberate use of strategies to implement, test, improve, and sustain an intervention as it is delivered to new populations
and/or through new delivery systems that differ from those in effectiveness trials. Aarons et al. distinguish three types of
scale-out: type I scale-out: population fixed, different delivery system; type II scale-out: delivery system fixed, different popula-
tion; type III scale-out: different population and delivery system [ 30].
Scale-up The deliberate effort to broaden the delivery of an intervention with the intention of reaching larger numbers of a target
audience. It often targets the same or very similar settings, under which the intervention has already been tested [ 30].
Social validity Refers to perceived acceptability, utility, and viability of the intervention. These perceptions might be influenced by cultural
worldview and the practical realities of life circumstances (e.g. transportation, insurance coverage, and work schedules) [ 31,42].Movsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 9 of 20
through the adaptation process ”[34]. Exploration of
intervention theory was also seen as important in
informing the decisions on the degrees of adaptations.
Category 3: Aspects of adaptation
Papers discussed different aspects of adaptation. We
categorised these in terms of the targets of adaptation
(i.e. what is modified) and the degrees of adaptation (i.e.
to what degree).
Targets of adaptation Most frequently, papers dis-
cussed content modifications as changes including
adding, deleting, or changing existing components
[33,35,43,44,46,54,57,64]. While modifications to
an intervention ’s content were seen to accommodate
the needs of the target group, papers cautioned against
modifications of “core components ”, which were seen as
unsafe changes [ 48,57]. Papers also discussed modifica-
tions to intervention delivery : these could include changes
to delivery agents (e.g. health practitioners vs. lay health
workers), or format of delivery (e.g. face-to-face vs. media)
[43,46,64]. Papers mentioned context as a potential target
of modification, such as changes to locations or settings
(e.g. community centre vs. church); however, we found lit-
tle detail and guidance on how to implement contextual
adaptations in practice [ 30,33,46,54]. For example,
Aarons et al. mention possible adaptations to the interven-
tion’s inner (e.g. changes within the organisation where
the intervention is delivered) and outer contexts (e.g.
changes to funding and contracting to support implemen-
tation) [ 30]. Finally, cultural adaptation was often consid-
ered as a distinct type of adaptation broadly defined as
changes to increase an intervention ’s cultural relevance
[33,35,42,46,60,61,64]. Beyond taking into account the
broader socio-cultural, economic, and political factors, pa-
pers emphasised the importance of considering transverse
cultural processes, exemplifying acculturative stress,
phases of migration, developmental stages, availability of
social support, and connections to the culture of origin
[33]. These processes were highlighted to be of particular
importance within the context of specific treatment adap-
tation and culturally sensitive delivery of psychotherapies.
Degrees of adaptation In the context of cultural adap-
tation, papers drew on Resnicow et al. to distinguish
between surface and deep structure modifications [65].
The former was reported as relating to harmonising
intervention materials (e.g. handbooks as part of manualised
interventions) to observable characteristics of the target
population, such as using cult urally appropriate messages,
language, and product brands to improve outward appeal,
acceptance, and face validity [ 35,51,56,58,61]. Deep struc-
ture adaptations, on the oth er hand, were commonly seen as
aligning the intervention with core values, beliefs, norms,and worldviews to increase salie nce (e.g. incorporating col-
lectivist values that emphasise interpersonal relationships in
a health promotion intervention) [ 35,43,51,56,58,61].
This distinction between surface and deep structure modifi-
cations was rather theoretical, and no guidance paper
described a specific method for applying such a
classification.
Category 4: Process of adaptation
Most papers provided a stepwise approach to adaptation
[29,31,32,34,36–38,40,41,43,45–53,55–60,62,63,
66]. Based on the analysis of commonalities and differ-
ences in these approaches, we identified 11 unique steps
for planning, conducting, and evaluating an adaptation
and categorised them into four overarching phases of
the EPIS implementation framework (see Fig. 2)[67]:
Exploration (steps 1 –3),Preparation (steps 4 –6),Imple-
mentation (steps 7 –9), and Sustainment (steps 10 –11).
Table 4provides a short description of these steps
(Additional file 5presents the steps as described in
each included paper and the frequency of reporting of
each step across the papers).
Before implementing an adaptation, many papers
highlighted the value of an exploration phase, including
an initial assessment (step 1) to identify the needs of the
target population, the system, the organisational cap-
acity, and thereby the need for a new intervention. After
this, it is important to select the appropriate intervention
for adaptation (step 2) involving identification of rele-
vant evidence-informed interventions, judgment of their
fit with the new context, and selection of the best match.
The selected intervention is then examined (step 3) for
its components and theory to determine its adaptability
to the new context. Following these, there are several
steps to prepare for the adaptation, including identifica-
tion of potential mismatches (step 4), development of an
intervention model (step 5), and establishment of im-
portant networks and capacity (step 6). The next phases
are concerned with the actual undertaking of the adapta-
tions, including development of the adaptation plan
(step 7), pilot testing of the proposed adaptations (step
8), and revisions and implementation of the adapted
intervention (step 9). Finally, the adapted intervention is
evaluated (step 10) both for important outcomes and for
the establishment of routine and ongoing supervision
and monitoring. The last step (step 11) involves activities
to disseminate the adapted intervention and sustain it
through training systems and ongoing re-assessments.
Paper authors described how these steps did not neces-
sarily follow a linear process. In line with best practice in
intervention development [ 68,69], individual steps within
the four phases were often described to take place in paral-
lel or had a different order across the papers. Furthermore,
there were differences in phas e attribution. For example,Movsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 10 of 20
some papers outlined establishment of relevant networks
(preparation phase, step 6) as a sub-step in the initial as-
sessment step (exploration phase) [ 36,37,45–47,56,58].
In contrast, some papers prior itised an in-depth needs as-
sessment at the beginning of the adaptation process (ex-
ploration phase) [ 32,41,62,63].
Category 5: Stakeholder involvement
Papers recommended a range of stakeholders to involve
in adaptation. While different papers emphasised differ-
ent stakeholders, we categorised the most commonly re-
ported stakeholders into five main groups: (i) local
community leaders, partners, and implementers [29,31,
32,34,36–41,45–47,49,50,52–56,58–62];(ii) repre-
sentatives of the target population [31,32,34,36–41,
44–47,49,52,53,55,58,60,61,63];(iii) intervention de-
velopers and topic experts [29,31,36,45,48,52,54,58,
62,63];(iv) researchers [29,36,43,46–48,55,59,60];
and (v) practitioners and policy-makers [29,31,32,34,
36–41,43–56,58–63,66]. Involvement of policy-makers
in intervention adaptation was mentioned in only twopapers [ 58,66], perhaps reflecting the predominant
focus of papers on micro- and meso-level interventions
(see Table 1).
Papers described different ways to involve these groups
of stakeholders across different steps of adaptation. For
example, needs assessment through formative research
and pilot testing was commonly proposed to engage and
learn from the local community partners and implemen-
ters during the exploration phase of adaptation [ 29,31,
36–41,45–47,50,52–54,58,60,62,63,66]. As part of
preparation and implementation phases, meetings and
consultations were suggested with intervention devel-
opers and topic experts to guide the adaptation process
and monitor fidelity [ 29,45,48,52,62,63]. Many papers
recommended following the CBPR approach to engage
with and seek input from community partners and rep-
resentatives of the target population [ 31,34,36–38,40,
41,45–47,49,52,53,56,59–61,66]. For example, focus
groups or elicitation interviews were often discussed as a
way to assess local capacity, resources, and preferences.

outcome research results and the lessons learned in the transportation
of the evidence-based intervention[29,41,53,66]Movsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 13 of 20
involve representatives of the target population respond-
ing to a demonstration of an adapted intervention were
also suggested [ 52].
A few papers highlighted the value of forming specific
stakeholder committees to lead the entire process of
adaptation [ 29,34,36,41,60,66]. A range of stakeholders
from those listed above were recommended for inclusion
in these committees depending on the topic and level of
the intervention. These committees were differently re-
ferred to in the papers as a Community Advisory Board
[60], a Community Working Group [ 41], and an Imple-
mentation Research Team [ 29].
Category 6: Evaluating adapted interventions
Papers often highlighted the need for additional testing
of effects of an adapted intervention in a new context,
however did not offer an explicit rationale for such an
evaluation or guidance for choosing and prioritising
among different evaluation approaches and methods.
Outcome evaluation was the most frequently reported
approach [ 30,34,35,38,41,46,47,49,50,52] with a
range of specific methods discussed, including different
types of randomised and non-randomised study designs.
Process evaluation [30,34,38,41,45–47,49,66],piloting
[31,35,45,52,58,63], and fidelity monitoring [29,41,
50,54,57,58] were also commonly mentioned. These
approaches were described separately, most frequently
as part of the distinct steps in the adaptation process.
Table 5provides further details on a range of ap-
proaches for re-evaluation, including the rationale and
specific methods for each approach.
We found only one paper proposing a strategy to deter-
mine the level of empirical evidence required for an
adapted intervention to retain its evidence-informed
standard in a new context [ 30]. Aarons et al. make a con-
ceptual argument for the possibility to “borrow strength ”
from evidence in the original effectiveness study to allow
for a more limited evaluation when scaling-out interven-
tions to new populations and/or using new delivery sys-
tems [ 30]. This would include, for instance, using
implementation evaluation rather than a new effectiveness
study when a strong case can be made for similar mecha-
nisms between original and new contexts. The authors ’
statements were largely theoretical, and they argue that
these require further empirical testing.
Discussion
Main findings in the context of other research
This study is the first systematic review of guidance on
adapting complex population health interventions to
new contexts. The review explores the content of 35 pa-
pers and sheds light on contested issues by providing a
thorough synthesis of key concepts frequently used in
adaptation research (see Table 3) and a comprehensiveoverview of adaptation processes (see Fig. 2and Table 4).
The review explicates the overall aims of adaptation,
which are largely framed as enhancing cultural relevance
and the sense of local ownership of the intervention with
explicit commitment to the principles of CBPR and
Roger ’s diffusion of innovations theory (see Table 1)[70].
Both perspectives highlight the sense of local ownership
as an important driver of intervention acceptability and
adoption [ 71,72].
Our findings are largely consistent with those of the
previous scoping study of adaptation frameworks [ 15].
As in the previous scoping study, we identified 11 com-
mon steps of adaptation. However, our review further
extends the previous work through a systematic ap-
proach and a broadened scope, including additional in-
sights from papers on cultural adaptation and a range of
topic areas beyond public health. In line with the previ-
ous scoping study [ 15], our review also finds relatively
widespread agreement in key concepts and the process
of adaptation.
Strengths and limitations of this systematic review
This review consolidates existing guidance on adaptation
following systematic searches in databases complemen-
ted by expert consultations to help locate additional
sources. Its key strengths lie in the thorough exploration
and synthesis of the content of the existing guidance fol-
lowing best practices in systematic reviewing, including
a broad search strategy in terms of databases and search
terms, double screening and data extraction, pilot testing
of the extraction form, and an evidence synthesis strat-
egy combining deductive and inductive approaches.
There were some limitations. First, while we aimed to
include papers in a range of languages, searches were
conducted in English, potentially missing relevant non-
English papers. Second, while we included a range of
terms related to adaptation in the search strategy (e.g.
replication, transfer), we might have missed terms used
synonymously by other researchers. This particularly re-
lates to guidance papers on macro-level interventions,
which were underrepresented in our review, as adapta-
tion may be framed and conceptualised differently for
these broader types of interventions (e.g. policy changes
rather than adaptations). Third, we had to use a strict
definition of guidance for practical considerations and
had rounds of discussions within the author team to de-
termine eligibility. As shown in Table 1, we included
only papers which explicitly provide recommendations
for practice. Many papers, which did not meet this
definition, but provided important discussions on inter-
vention adaptation, were left out, such as the classifica-
tion of adaptations by Stirman et al. [ 16] and works on
cultural adaptation by Castro et al. [ 17] and Resnicow
et al. [ 65]. It should, however, be noted that the includedMovsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 14 of 20

papers often referred to these conceptual resources to
support their definitions and recommendations. We can
thus argue that much of the thinking in these resources
has shaped the guidance papers included in our review.
Finally, we did not assess the utility of the guidance pa-
pers from a user ’s perspective and used data as reported.
Our quality appraisal, for example, may have missed im-
portant information that was not included in the papers.
However, we used pre-defined criteria for quality ap-
praisal to enhance the rigour and transparency of our
approach.
Limitations of existing guidance and recommendations
for future research and guidance
While our review found large agreement with respect to
terminology, reasons, types, and processes of adaptation,
the papers included in our review have predominantly
been developed and applied in the USA. The key gov-
ernmental agencies supporting the work on adaptation
frameworks have been those responsible for child health,
the control of infectious diseases and substance abuse,
which explains the predominant focus on topics, such as
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV prevention,
and parenting. This questions whether the current guid-
ance adequately reflects intervention adaptation for a
broader set of topic areas and across a broader range of
countries, particularly when adapting interventions to
low- and middle-income settings with varying levels of
resources and systems of provision.
Our review also identified important gaps in scope,
conceptualisation, and operationalisation in the existing
guidance. First, as noted above, the available guidance
has a predominant focus on micro-level (behavioural) in-
terventions and their transfer to specific sub-groups.
While important insights for adaptation can be gleaned
from this body of work, the applicability of the suggested
procedures for transferring broader macro-level inter-
ventions across countries and continents might be ques-
tioned. This includes, for example, potential challenges
associated with using CBPR principles and procedures
(as widely discussed in the current papers) and engaging
with policy-makers at national-level institutions and
decision-making. While papers published later in the
2010s were more inclusive of meso-level interventions
(see Table 1), they were few in our review. This suggests
a need for additional research on scaling-out and adapta-
tion of meso- and macro-level interventions (e.g. policy
interventions), including literature reviews using tailored
searches to identify studies, that may use a different
framing of and terms for adaptation.
Our findings also suggest lack of theorisation in terms
of intervention mechanisms and broader systems think-
ing in the existing guidance [ 3,4]. It is increasingly
recognised that interventions represent events incomplex systems and that their effects are a result of in-
teractions between context, implementation, and inter-
vention design itself [ 73,74]. At present, this perspective
is not adequately reflected and operationalised in the
existing guidance. Interventions are exclusively seen as
relatively fixed and bounded entities consisting of a set
of distinct components (core or discretionary), the pres-
ence, absence, or combinations of which are seen as re-
sponsible for the observed outcomes without explicitly
linking them with intervention mechanisms. Further-
more, while there is a common emphasis on the need to
distinguish between intervention core and discretionary
components, we did not find guidance on how to iden-
tify the core components that need to be maintained
during adaptation. If this was intended to be accom-
plished through engagement with the developers of the
original intervention, it was not transparently discussed
in the papers as a key purpose of such engagement. It is
important that future guidance more transparently de-
scribes the processes of intervention exploration (see
Fig. 2), including the specific roles of key stakeholders
and management of potential conflicts that may arise
from their involvement. In general, transparent reporting
of an interventions ’theory and how it may be imple-
mented in practice (i.e. theory-based strategies) will also
be informative for adaptation research [ 75,76]. While a
lot of work has been done on articulating intervention
theories in the literature on the development and evalu-
ation of interventions [ 68,77], it does not seem to have
adequately translated into adaptation research, and fu-
ture work should aim to fill this gap.
Key concepts, such as adaptation and fidelity (see
Table 3), are also largely conceptualised in relation to
intervention form, that is, specific design features rather
than intervention mechanisms and functions. While
intervention components can be linked to specific mech-
anisms, as highlighted by Hawe et al. [ 18], it is arguably
not the design components that need to be standardised,
but rather the aspects of intervention mechanisms that
these components are aiming to facilitate. Similarly,
there is a lack of critical engagement with different types
of context. Where discussed, it is primarily seen as a fac-
tor facilitating or impeding implementation rather than
as an inherent and active element in the construction of
intervention effects. No paper directly guides the user to
critically examine the underlying mechanisms and the
possible contextual interactions that could matter in the
replicability of the effects [ 78,79]. While many papers
highlight the potential mismatches in the contextual
characteristics between the original and the new con-
texts as important pre-requisites for adaptation, they do
not discuss the implications of these mismatches for
intervention effects in a new context. This is a particu-
larly important issue to tackle in light of the evidenceMovsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 16 of 20
suggesting no added benefits associated with extensively
adapted interventions [ 5] alongside the evidence in
favour of these adaptations [ 7,80]. Future guidance
needs to reflect more critically on intervention mecha-
nisms and contextual interactions to inform decisions
on the need and the extent of adaptation that might be
warranted. There is a growing body of literature on how
to design and implement interventions in a context-
sensitive manner [ 12,74,77,81]. This involves, for ex-
ample, delineation of important contextual characteris-
tics, such as epidemiological, socio-cultural, socio-
economic, ethical, legal, and political factors [ 81] and
theorisation and testing of how intervention effects may
be contingent upon these factors.
Another key gap relates to the appropriate evaluation
of adapted interventions. While different approaches to
and methods of evaluation are described, ranging from
feasibility studies to full-scale randomised evaluation
studies, no guidance is given on how to choose among
these methods. Full-scale evaluation of an adapted inter-
vention can be costly and resource-intensive, and further
research should empirically test the conceptual arguments
set forth by Aarons et al. on the possibility of an adapted
intervention to “borrow strength ”as a potentially efficient
approach [ 30]. In a similar vein, our review identified a
range of stakeholders to be consulted during the adapta-
tion process. While stakeholder involvement is widely
viewed as positive in achieving greater acceptability and fit
of the intervention, it might be associated with additional
financial and human resource costs [ 82]. Further research
and testing on which stakeholders should be prioritised
during which phase of the adaptation process and on the
optimal types and levels of involvement is warranted to
provide efficient solutions.
Finally, as highlighted previously [ 14], further guidance
also needs to be established on how best to document
and report intervention adaptation. Although our review
aimed to extract data on intervention reporting, we did
not find any guidance providing recommendations for
adaptation reporting. Recently, Stirman and colleagues
published the updated Framework for Reporting of Ad-
aptations and Modifications to Evidence-based interven-
tions (FRAME) approach [ 83]. While the framework
largely focuses on documentation of adaptations during
the implementation process, it includes a range of items
potentially applicable for different contexts of adaptation
(e.g. planned and unplanned adaptations). Further appli-
cation and testing of this framework would be warranted
in the context of planned intervention adaptations to
new contexts.
How to use this systematic review?
We see three broad uses of our review. First, it can serve
as a catalogue of existing guidance papers on adaptationand therefore aid researchers and practitioners in easily
locating relevant resources to consult for their context
of work. Second, by synthesising existing recommenda-
tions and delineating important gaps, this review
contributes in setting the research agenda for future
methodological work on adaptation where further
innovation would be required. Specifically, the review
findings inform the next steps of the ADAPT Study. The
synthesis of the key concepts (see Table 3), and
highlighting areas of clarity and uncertainty in concep-
tual thinking, will inform the planned overarching guid-
ance. It is important to further problematise the review
findings in light of the key gaps and seek further input
and agreement around contested issues, such as concep-
tualisation of fidelity in relation to intervention form vs.
intervention function, differentiation between interven-
tion core vs. discretionary components, and the language
used around these concepts and procedures. Some of
our review findings, specifically the phases and steps of
adaptation (see Table 4and Fig. 2), provide clear first
drafts for structuring the ultimate guidance and will
serve as the starting point for the next stages of the
study. Issues such as whether the number of steps in the
process of adaptation as identified in this review is prac-
tical and how the steps may be further revised and opti-
mised will be explored in the next stages of the ADAPT
Study, which include a scoping review of cases of inter-
vention adaptation followed by qualitative interviews
with a range of stakeholders, such as researchers, editors,
and funders to examine adaptation practices and com-
pare those with the existing guidance. Subsequently, an
international Delphi panel will be convened, where key
considerations and issues from previous stages, including
this review, will be examined and refined through several
rounds of revisions and feedback [ 11]. Finally, our review
findings can provide those adapting interventions to new
contexts with interim tools to consult until the ADAPT
Study guidance is available. It should, however, be noted
that we do not intend for our review findings to be used
as a source of expert advice on adaptation, but rather
that it should be considered reflectively as a descriptive
synthesis of existing concepts and recommendations.
Conclusion
This systematic review synthesises currently available
guidance on adapting interventions to new contexts. It
can be used as a resource for researchers, policy-makers,
and practitioners working to adapt interventions to new
contexts. By highlighting important gaps in the field, the
findings also serve to inform future methodological work
and guidance development on adaptation. The findings
will be used to inform the ADAPT Study guidance on
adapting population health interventions to new contexts.Movsisyan et al. Implementation Science          (2019) 14:105 Page 17 of 20
