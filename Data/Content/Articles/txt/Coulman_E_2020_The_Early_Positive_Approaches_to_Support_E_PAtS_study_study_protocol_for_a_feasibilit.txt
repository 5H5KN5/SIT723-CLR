Abstract
Background: Children with intellectual disability have an IQ < 70, associated deficits in adaptive skills and are at
increased risk of having clinically concerning levels of behaviour problems. In addition, parents of children with
intellectual disability are likely to report high levels of mental health and other psychological problems. The Early
Positive Approaches to Support (E-PAtS) programme for family caregivers of young children (5 years and under)
with intellectual and developmental disabilities is a group-based intervention which aims to enhance parental
psychosocial wellbeing and service access and support positive development for children. The aim of this study is
to assess the feasibility of delivering E-PAtS to family caregivers of children with intellectual disability by community
parenting support service provider organisations. The study will inform a potential, definitive RCT of the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of E-PAtS.

Methods: This study is a feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process evaluation. Up to 2
family caregivers will be recruited from 64 families with a child (18 months to 5 years) with intellectual disability at
research sites in the UK. Participating families will be allocated to intervention: control on a 1:1 basis; intervention
families will be offered the E-PAtS programme immediately, continuing to receive usual practice, and control
participants will be offered the opportunity to attend the E-PAtS programme at the end of the follow-up period
and will continue to receive usual practice. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months post-randomisation and 12
months post-randomisation. The primary aim is to assess feasibility via the assessment of: recruitment of service
provider organisations; participant recruitment; randomisation; retention; intervention adherence; intervention
fidelity and the views of participants, intervention facilitators and service provider organisations regarding
intervention delivery and study processes. The secondary aim is preliminary evaluation of a range of established
outcome measures for individual family members, subsystem relationships and overall family functioning, plus
additional health economic outcomes for inclusion in a future definitive trial.
Discussion: The results of this study will inform a potential future definitive trial, to evaluate the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of the E-PAtS intervention to improve parental psychosocial wellbeing. Such a trial would have
significant scientific impact internationally in the intellectual disability field.

Background
Children with intellectual disability (ID) are defined as
having an IQ < 70. They have associated deficits in adap-
tive skills, with impairments emerging in the ‘develop-
mental period ’—typically considered to be before age 18
years. Just over 2% of children in England have been
identified by local authorities/schools as having ID, ac-
cording to data by the UK Learning Disability Observa-
tory [ 1], and although prevalence varies slightly with
socio-economic factors, it appears broadly similar across
the UK.
UK population-based data have shown that children
with ID are 4 –5 times more likely to have a diagnosable
mental health disorder [ 2] compared to other UK chil-
dren. In addition, high proportions (60 –80%) of children
with ID in population-based samples have clinically con-
cerning levels of behaviour problems (including hyper-
activity and conduct problems) [ 3]. These health
inequalities for children with ID emerge by the time the
child with ID is 3 –5 years of age at the latest [ 4].
Furthermore, longitudinal studies suggest that in-
creased behavioural and emotional problems in the child
with ID leads to deterioration in parental wellbeing over
time, and vice versa [ 5,6]. Data from UK population-
based research show that parents, especially mothers, of
children with ID are 2 –3 times more likely to report ele-
vated or clinically concerning levels of mental health and
other psychological problems when compared to parents
who do not have a child with ID [ 3]. Population-based
data for the UK and other countries suggest that rates of
mental health problems at a level of clinical concern
range from between approximately one third and onehalf of this population of parents [ 5]. Thus, parents of
young children with ID represent a high-risk population
in terms of parental psychosocial (ill) health.
Moving beyond the dyadic association between the
wellbeing of a child with ID and a parent, family re-
search studies applying family systems theory [ 7,8] show
findings that reflect similar data in other family mem-
bers. For example, the psychological problems of the
child with ID can negatively affect sibling wellbeing, as
well as that of parents [ 5]. In addition, parental relation-
ship problems, parent-child relationships, sibling rela-
tionships and overall family functioning may all be
adversely affected in families of children with ID [ 5].
Parental wellbeing in families of children with ID may
also be more strongly (or at least as strongly) associated
with their partner ’s wellbeing than with their child ’s[5].
Furthermore, access to specialised supports is also a
challenge for families of children with ID. For example,
less than 30% of parents of children with ID who also
had a diagnosable mental health problem had access to
mental health services in the preceding 12 months [ 9].
Thus, children with ID and their parents face significant
health inequalities and potential problems accessing ap-
propriate support.
Given the research evidence, interventions are needed
that target both parental wellbeing and child health out-
comes, especially taking into account the very high levels
of behaviour problems in young children with ID. Fur-
thermore, parenting behaviours and parent-child rela-
tionship factors have been shown in longitudinal
research studies to affect the short- to medium-term
course and severity of behaviour problems in childrenCoulman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:147 Page 2 of 15
with ID [ 5,10]. Thus, interventions that target both par-
enting practices/strategies and parent-child relationships
could have significant potential to support families of
young children with ID.
Recent systematic reviews of parenting interventions
for parents of children with ID have been conducted by
NICE to inform the Mental Health Problems in People
with Learning Disability [ 11]. Although 15 RCTs of par-
enting programmes involving parents of children with
ID were reviewed, parent wellbeing was not the focus of
any of these programmes, the programmes were not de-
veloped specifically for parents of children with ID but
were adapted from mainstream parenting programmes
[12], and the programmes were not targeted at families
of young children specifically. The single exception was
a RCT of an individual-family delivered positive behav-
ioural support intervention for young children with ID
and severe behaviour problems [ 13], comparing the
intervention alone to a version including a parent op-
timism component. Thus, NICE found no evidence of
group parenting programmes designed specifically for
parents of young children w ith ID, without a specific
focus on a problem related to the child (e.g., severe
behaviour problems) and with the explicit aim of im-
proving parent psychosocial wellbeing, therefore dem-
onstrating a gap in the evidence base.
E-PAtS directly addresses the gap in both the availabil-
ity of suitable group parenting programmes and in the
evidence base. The E-PAtS bespoke family caregiver
programme has been co-produced by family caregivers
and professionals and is specifically informed by existing
ID research evidence from children with ID and their
families [ 14], in addition to developmental system
approaches to early intervention [ 15]. E-PAtS is also
routinely co-facilitated by a family caregiver and profes-
sional working in partnership as an 8 session group
programme, suitable for all families of young children
with ID, to support caregiver wellbeing, service access
and positive development for children.
Parenting programmes for families of children with ID
are likely to be a priority for UK services for several de-
cades. For example, in England, ID services across the
NHS, local authorities and the for-profit and third sector
are undergoing considerable change as a result of the
government ’s Transforming Care programme. The ser-
vice model from the Transforming Care programme [ 16]
identifies early intervention/early support, and support
and skills training for parents as a part of a regional/
community response to better services for families of
children with ID. In Scotland, parenting interventions
are also a priority and are seen as a key way to improve
the life chances of disadvantaged groups, including chil-
dren with ID. The Scottish Government has proposed a
coordinated parenting strategy across statutory and thirdsector organisations, with partners from the third sector
taking a lead in delivering parenting interventions [ 17].
A feasibility study for E-PAtS, with the potential for a
later large scale RCT evaluation, would therefore make a
significant contribution to providing UK evidence and
informing on-going policy.
Apart from direct relevance to UK policy and practice,
evidence from a robust programme of research on E-
PAtS has the potential for substantial international sci-
entific and policy impact. First, existing RCTs of group
parenting programmes with parents of children with ID
involve small samples only. Second, existing intervention
studies have included, and thus measured outcomes typ-
ically for, only one parent in each family. Thus, effective-
ness for fathers or for the non-included parent in the
family remains unknown. Third, data analysis of existing
group intervention RCTs has often failed to take account
of the nested nature of the data (i.e. failing to account
for parents clustered within the parenting groups that
they attend). This study, as a potential to inform a large
definitive RCT, may be a stepping stone to directly ad-
dress these points and thus have significant scientific im-
pact internationally in the ID field.
Methods/design
Objectives/aim
The aim of the feasibility RCT is to assess the feasibility
of delivering E-PAtS to family caregivers of children with
ID by community parenting support service provider or-
ganisations. The study will aim to contribute to the evi-
dence base on improving outcomes for children with ID
and their family caregivers. Importantly, the study will
inform a potential, definitive RCT of the effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of E-PAtS.
The study ’s primary objectives are to assess the
following:
/C15The feasibility of recruiting eligible participants to
the study and the most effective recruitment
pathways to identify families of young children with
ID.
/C15The feasibility of recruiting suitable intervention
providers and facilitators to deliver the E-PAtS
intervention.
/C15Recruitment rates and retention through 3 months
and 12 months post-randomisation follow-up data
collection.
/C15The acceptability of study processes, including
randomisation, to both service provider
organisations, facilitators and family caregivers
through qualitative interviews.
/C15The acceptability of intervention delivery to both
service provider organisations, facilitators and family
caregivers through qualitative interviews.Coulman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:147 Page 3 of 15
/C15Adherence to the intervention, reach and fidelity of
implementation of the E-PAtS intervention through
attendance records, evaluation of session recordings
and participant/facilitator qualitative interviews.
/C15Usual practice in this setting and use of services/
support by intervention and control participants.
/C15The feasibility and acceptability of proposed
outcome measures for a definitive trial, including
resource use and health-related quality of life data,
as methods to measure effectiveness of the interven-
tion and to conduct an embedded health economic
evaluation within a definitive RCT.
/C15Acceptability of collecting and analysing routinely
collected data within a definitive RCT.
/C15Service provider organisation willingness to
participate in a definitive trial.
Study design
The study is a 2-arm, cluster (family caregivers in fam-
ilies) randomised controlled trial, with 1:1 randomisation
using randomly permuted blocks, stratified by study site
and choice of either study pathway A (control partici-
pants to be offered E-PAtS on a waitlist) or pathway B
(control participants not offered E-PAtS). Participants
will be recruited, asked to select study pathway and ran-
domised. Intervention participants will be offered E-
PAtS immediately, and all participants will continue to
have access to usual support and advice services
provided.
Study setting
The study will take place in up to 4 study sites, defined
as geographical areas where service provider organisa-
tions offer support services to parents provider
organisations.
Site selection
Service provider organisations will be selected as sites
for the E-PAtS feasibility study if they fulfil the following
selection criteria:
1. Service provider organisations are prepared to refer
a sufficient number of potential participants/families
to the study team.
2. Service provider organisations are prepared to
deliver up to 2 E-PAtS courses at two periods
throughout the study: (1) immediately following
randomisation and (2) following data collection 12
months post-randomisation.
Participant selection
Families will be referred to the study team by service
provider organisations in their local area following a
flexible multi-point recruitment method including via:established referral routes, local and national charitable
support organisations, local authority services, special
schools and nurseries, after school/weekend services for
children with special educational needs and disabilities,
parent/family support groups, social media, advertising
in the media in local areas, and self-referral.
The strategy is aimed to be flexible and collaborative,
and information will be gathered regarding the most ef-
fective participant-identification processes to inform a
definitive trial.
All potential participants will have been provided with
a participant information sheet and will have confirmed
interest in participating in the study either directly with
the service provider organisation or by returning a com-
pleted reply slip to the study team. Potential participants
will be contacted by study team researchers to arrange a
short screening/recruitment interview, either by tele-
phone or face-to-face.
Eligibility criteria
Clusters will be family units with at least one young
child with an ID. For each cluster, a primary parent/
caregiver will be recruited to the study. Subsequently, a
secondary family caregiver may be recruited to the
study.
/C15The identified child with ID must meet the
following criteria:
/C15Inclusion criteria
/C15Aged 18 months –5 years (up to the day before
the child ’s 6th birthday)

(learning disability/learning difficulties in UK
terminology), referring to identification of the
child within the education, health or social
care systems as having ID or as eligible for
receipt of specialist ID services or diagnoses
indicating the presence of ID for younger
children (e.g. ‘global developmental delay ’) and
has a standard score on the Vineland Adaptive
Behaviour Scales [ 18] composite score of < 80
(allowing for measurement error but still
indicating significant developmental delay) at
the time of the screening interview.

quire urgent case management; alternative
forms of support will be recommended to
families in crisis.

Intervention
E-PAtS is a manualised programme for family caregivers
of children with ID and will be provided in addition to
usual practice (UP).
Intervention
The E-PAtS programme comprises (1) an individual
preparation interview for family caregivers with the co-
facilitator or a representative from their organisation, (2)
8 (typically weekly) 2.5 hourly group sessions, and (3) a
personalised workbook and associated resources.
Preparation interview
Each family caregiver will attend an individual, support-
ive, preparatory interview with a co-facilitator or repre-
sentative of the organisation to enable family caregivers
to plan for the attendance, to ensure the group is an

appropriate fit to their needs and to resolve any potential
barriers, with the ultimate aim to encourage and support
attendance and engagement.
Group sessions
The group sessions are delivered at times of day deter-
mined by the service provider organisation in accord-
ance with the needs and preferences of participating
families and may be delivered in a range of community
settings including child development centres, commu-
nity centres and church halls. The content of each ses-
sion provides an overview of each subject area and
focuses on supporting family caregiver wellbeing and
parenting behaviour in the context of raising a young
child with ID. It provides targeted support and resources
to family caregivers to support future engagement with
other professional services and systems of social support.
The content is evidence-based and utilises theoretical
and practical considerations to empower family care-
givers and activate improved patterns of family inter-
action (following the developmental systems model forearly intervention [ 9]). Session content is delivered via
presentation and structured exercises but primarily
through group discussion. See Table 1for a summary of
each session content.
The E-PAtS group process aims to create an emotion-
ally and socially supportive setting that encourages en-
gagement and supports the wellbeing needs of family
caregivers. Both working with peers who are experien-
cing similar challenges and difficulties and being sup-
ported by a facilitator who is also a caregiver provide
emotional validation and inspiration to group members.
Presentation of materials and exercises, via a combin-
ation of oral and video presentations, group discussion
and in-vivo exercises are also designed to support family
caregiver engagement, identify their particular needs and
strengths and empower them to build upon these.
The content of each session is focused to the needs
and circumstances of the attending family caregivers.
Prior to delivery of each programme, facilitators are re-
quired to make localised adaptions to programme mate-
rials (e.g. information provided about current and local

financial and service supports). Facilitators are also
trained to respond to the specific needs of individual
group members during delivery of each session (e.g. cit-
ing examples and strategies that are aligned with the
presenting needs and circumstances of family caregivers
who are in attendance and their children). Family care-
givers are given opportunities to rehearse and develop
strategies and skills within sessions but not assigned
tasks to complete between sessions. This is based on the
assumption that participants will likely present with a
range of different needs and circumstances and are likely
to need to develop family support systems and personal
resource as a pre-requisite to implementing self-
management and child-focused strategies outside of the
session. This may be possible for some participants
within the time-frame of programme delivery but more
typically is predicted to occur following programme
completion.
Family caregivers are encouraged to attend all sessions
whether or not they or their child is currently displaying
a difficulty in the topic area. This recommendation re-
flects the fact that caregivers and children with ID are at
increased risk of experiencing difficulties across all topic
areas sometime in their development, but that this could
be reduced through early intervention and proactive
support. In addition, it is considered that participating
caregivers will contribute towards the group process
mechanisms, with the potential to support other group
members in relation to one or more of the curriculum
areas and that this may have potential benefits for both
the caregiver in question and other group members.
However, the structuring of the E-PAtS curriculum is ar-
ranged to allow some flexibility in attendance to further
increase engagement opportunities; key themes (espe-
cially parent wellbeing) are repeated throughout all
sessions.
Personalised workbook
All family caregivers are provided with a workbook to
accompany the programme. The workbook contains
additional materials, tools and signposting resources in
relation to each content area. The workbook is built
around a ‘person-centred profile ’detailing the specific
support needs for each family ’s child. By completing the
workbook throughout the programme, families are
empowered to create a resource, based on their know-
ledge and experience, combined with evidence-based
practices to inform broader systems of family and child
support in the future. The workbook also allows infor-
mation and learning from the programme to be shared
with other family members who are unable to attend
sessions directly, contributing towards engagement with
fathers and other family caregivers and the developmentof a shared, collaborative approach for supporting
children.
Engagement with secondary caregivers
Participation of fathers in group-based parent training
occurs at low rates [ 20]. Engaging with secondary care-
givers (including fathers) is an important part of the E-
PAtS programme which aims (though does not necessi-
tate) to engage with two family caregivers. The involve-
ment of secondary caregivers is, therefore, explicitly
targeted in the programme and a collaborative, shared/
co-parenting approach to supporting children is pro-
moted to family caregivers throughout the sessions and
is supported via the pre-programme interview and work-
book resources.
E-PAtS facilitators
The intervention will be co-delivered by a health or so-
cial care professional facilitator (including education
professionals) and a caregiver facilitator dyad. All facili-
tators complete a 5-day manualised training programme
comprising 1.5 days of teaching in relation to the evi-
dence base, theory and ways of working that underpin
E-PAtS; 1.5 days teaching regarding the programme cur-
riculum for E-PAtS; and 2 days of tutoring practice-
based demonstration regarding curriculum delivery,
group process and co-delivery of E-PAtS. Facilitators
need to be able to demonstrate necessary skills and un-
derstanding of E-PAtS during the final training session,
prior to implementation, and receive a period of super-
vised practice (between 2 and 3 supervision meetings
with the E-PAtS programme trainer during the first fa-
cilitation of a programme). Each service provider organ-
isation will be provided with an implementation manual
detailing practical elements that the service provider or-
ganisation and facilitators need to consider in order to
deliver E-PAtS (e.g. role profiles for facilitators, practical
suggestions about location set-up and all additional re-
sources required to deliver E-PAtS).
Each service provider organisation will be provided
with an implementation manual detailing practical ele-
ments that the service provider organisation and facilita-
tors need to deliver E-PAtS (e.g. role profiles for
facilitators, practical suggestions about location set-up,
and all additional resources required to deliver E-PAtS).
Usual practice/comparator
The comparator intervention will be usual practice (UP)
with optional waitlist E-PAtS. UP includes any service
(mainstream and specialised) provided to families and
their children with ID as a part of an education, health
and care plan (or equivalent outside of England) or via
any other mechanism. Children with ID and their fam-
ilies could receive a wide variety of care and supportCoulman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:147 Page 7 of 15
from health, social and education sectors and the third
sector depending on their needs. UP may vary by func-
tion (e.g. parent support, intervention for the child) and/
or by the main recipient (the parent, the child with ID,
the whole family). UP may include parenting support or
psychological therapy for psychosocial health, but we
will not recruit primary caregivers already receiving a
recognisable parenting programme intervention or a
psychological therapy for mental health problems, at the
time of baseline assessments (see Exclusion criteria). UP
will be recorded in the study in interviews with family
carers and through service use data. In addition, a survey
of parents of young children with ID in the UK will be
carried out (estimated n= 500+) to record their recent
use of early years and early intervention services. These
data will enable us to assess the families ’level of access
to interventions and describe the difference in content,
delivery and value between usual practice and E-PAtS.
This information will inform a later definitive trial and
other future research.
Retention strategy
To maintain engagement, encourage retention and to
thank family caregivers for their time, primary carers will
be provided with a £10 high street voucher when con-
tacted to complete follow-up data collection, as has pre-
viously been shown to be effective [ 21]. Contact details
will be collected during recruitment, and participants
will be reminded by email and text message when a data
collection follow-up is due and to complete question-
naires when posted. Participants will also receive a study
newsletter at approximately 9 –10 months post-
randomisation to maintain participant engagement. Par-
ticipants will be offered three methods of data collection:
via telephone, postal or face-to-face at a convenient loca-
tion. For non-responding participants, a minimum data-
set (consisting of 3 prioritised outcome measures
(Warwick Edinburgh Well-Being Scale, EQ-5D and Par-
enting Sense of Competence Scale) aligning with the
intervention logic model and taking into consideration
participant burden) will be offered to reduce participant
burden and maximise follow-up rates.
Sample size calculation
A total of 64 families (32 families in the usual practice
(UP) arm, 32 in the intervention arm) will be recruited.
As this is a feasibility study, and the purpose is to pro-
vide estimates of key parameters for a future trial rather
than to power the current study to detect statistically
significant differences, a formal a priori power calcula-
tion will not be conducted [ 22]. However, recruiting 64
families will provide a certain level of precision around a
95% confidence interval (CI). While the sample size is
based on families, outcome data will be collected forindividual parents. Parents within the same family will
be randomised to the same arm, making this a cluster
feasibility study with randomisation.
Outcomes —SPIRIT figure
The following primary outcomes will be measured and
used to inform the decision to progress to a definitive
trial:
/C15Recruitment rates and effectiveness of recruitment
pathways
/C15Study retention rates
/C15Adherence to the E-PAtS programme
/C15Fidelity of E-PAtS programme delivery
/C15Service provider organisation recruitment rates and
willingness to participate in feasibility and definitive
trial.
/C15Assessment of the barriers and facilitating factors for
recruitment, engagement and intervention delivery
from the perspective of all stakeholders
/C15Measurement of usual practice
/C15Acceptability of collecting and analysing routinely
collected data within a definitive trial.
The feasibility of using a range of established outcome
measures, proposed to test the intervention in a main
trial, will be assessed. This study is not designed to test
effectiveness; the acceptability of individual proposed
outcome measures (via completion rates, quality of com-
pletion and qualitative data) will inform the selection of
outcome measures for a definitive trial. The proposed
outcome measures will include those for individual fam-
ily members, sub-system relationships and overall family
functioning. Proposed outcomes have been chosen based
on experience in research with families of young chil-
dren with ID including the total measurement load fam-
ily caregivers have been willing to bear, brevity but with
good psychometric properties and potential comparisons
with national datasets (e.g. Millennium Cohort Study) to
provide context for the meaning of scores obtained. All
proposed outcome measures are administered to the
family caregiver. Please see Table 2for details and tim-
ings of all proposed outcome measures for a definitive
trial (SPIRIT figure) and Additional file 1for the SPIRIT
checklist.

process, will be fully explained, and family caregivers will
be provided a participant information sheet by email or
post. Written consent or verbal consent will be obtained
in face-to-face or telephone screening interviews re-
spectively. Screening measures will be taken to establish
eligibility, including the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour
Scales (VABS) [ 18] and the Brief Family Distress Scale
[19]. Scoring of the VABS will be conducted following
the screening visit by the RA and quality checked by a
trained member of the study team. The family caregiver
will be informed of their eligibility and if applicable, a re-
cruitment interview arranged.
Recruitment and consent
A recruitment interview will be conducted either via
telephone or face-to-face with a study team RA. Partici-
pants will have been provided with the participant infor-
mation sheet (see ‘Participant Screening ’section) and
given sufficient time to consider the information prior to
the interview. All study processes will be explained in
detail, including randomisation and burden for the par-
ticipant. Written consent or verbal consent will be ob-
tained in face-to-face or telephone interviews
respectively. The following data collection forms will be
completed: a participant ’s contact form including mul-
tiple methods of contact (address, telephone, email ad-
dress) to minimise loss to follow-up; preferences for
follow-up data collection (face-to-face interview comple-
tion, telephone-based completion or postal question-
naires); preferences for choice of study pathway
(participants randomised to the control group who
choose pathway A will be invited to attend E-PAtS 12
months post-randomisation and participants who choose
pathway B will not be invited to an E-PAtS course);
baseline questionnaire including baseline demographics
and outcome measures.
Frequency and duration of follow-up
Data will be collected at 3 months post-randomisation
and 12 months post-randomisation. Participants will be
contacted by RAs to complete the 5 min speech sample
at 3 months post-randomisation and brief VABS at 12
months post-randomisation, either by telephone or face-
to-face. All remaining outcome measures (see Table 2)
will be collected via postal questionnaire, telephone
interview by the RA or face-to-face interview with the
RA, depending on the participants ’preference at base-
line and whether participants have requested an alterna-
tive means of data collection subsequently. To reduce
the risk of bias, RAs will read questions from the ques-
tionnaire directly, remain blind to the participants ’allo-
cation and will ask participants not to reveal their
allocation. If allocation is revealed, this will be noted.
Intervention participants who requested telephone orface-to-face data collection at the 3 months post-
randomisation follow-up will be contacted by the study/
data manager to complete the group cohesion scale to
prevent unblinding to the RA in these instances.
Programme attendance will be collected by the facilita-
tors and supplied to the research team directly.
Randomisation/sequence generation
The study is a 2-arm, cluster randomised controlled
trial. Clusters will be families with a child with ID, and
up to 2 participants will be recruited per cluster. Fam-
ilies will be randomised post recruitment and comple-
tion of all baseline measures. Families will be
randomised, using randomly permuted blocks, stratified
by study site and choice of study pathway (pathway A or
B) and an equal allocation 1:1 ratio to E-PAtS in
addition to usual practice (UP) or UP alone. The study
manager/data manager will conduct randomisation and
will inform participants, and the service provider organ-
isation, of their allocation by telephone. RAs at site, re-
sponsible for collecting follow-up data, and all remaining
study team members (including the trial statistician) will
remain blind to participants ’allocation.
Process evaluation
MRC guidance [ 9] will be used as a framework for the
process evaluation to describe implementation processes,
refine the intervention logic model through examining
intervention mechanisms and consider the role of con-
text in shaping intervention implementation and mecha-
nisms. The process evaluation will employ a mixed
methods approach and will focus on the study primary
objectives. Quantitative methods including attendance
logs and intervention self-report checklists, completed
by facilitators, and intervention video/audio recordings
will be used to assess recruitment rates/patterns, attend-
ance and intervention fidelity, reach and adherence.
Using a pre-defined checklist, fidelity will be assessed by
determining the proportion of key messages and activ-
ities which are completed as intended in each session.
Qualitative interviews with facilitators, service provider
organisations and family caregivers will examine imple-
mentation processes, intervention mechanisms, and the
role of contextual factors and interrogate patterns in the
quantitative data, as well as inform assessment of the
feasibility of implementing E-PAtS within a definitive
trial.
Data management and security
All data will be checked visually on receipt by the study
administrator, data manager or study manager. Study
management data will be entered on to a MS Access
Database by the study manager or study administrator.
Study data will be entered on to paper questionnaires/Coulman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:147 Page 11 of 15
case report forms either by the participants, facilitators
or by RAs at site and returned to the study team by post
or couriered securely. RAs will be trained in Good Clin-
ical Practice (GCP) and study-specific processes. Partici-
pant data will be pseudonymised and entered manually
onto a secure, password-protected Microsoft SQL data-
base by the study administrator (SA) and data queries
noted. Ten percent of all data will be quality checked
and all data queries actioned by the data manager. Any
key data queries will be taken to the study management
group or steering committee as appropriate. Finally, data
will be checked during data cleaning using SPSS syntax
for validations and missing data. Hard copies of person-
ally identifiable and research data will be held separately
and securely in a locked cupboard, with access limited
to essential research team members.
Qualitative interview and observation recordings will
be recorded on encrypted audio-recorders/video re-
corders and stored on password-protected computers at
site. Recordings will be securely transferred to the study
team at the Centre for Trials Research by Fastfile or
courier. All files will be encrypted, and transcripts will
be fully pseudonymised prior to analysis. All qualitative
interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed fully, and
pseudonymised for analysis. Computer software (NVivo)
will be used to manage the qualitative data and tran-
scripts. Data security and confidentiality will be ensured,
in line with GDPR. A data management plan will be
completed and adhered to. Only the trial team will have
access to the final study dataset.
Statistical methods/analysis plan
This protocol paper follows SPIRIT guidelines, and the
analysis and reporting of this pragmatic randomised
controlled trial will be in accordance with CONSORT
(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines.
Significance tests will not be reported as the E-PAtS
feasibility RCT is not powered to test hypotheses. The
majority of outcome analysis will be descriptive in na-
ture. Continuous data will be reported as means and
standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges,
as appropriate. Categorical data will be reported as fre-
quencies and proportions. Feasibility outcomes will be
estimated with their associated 95% confidence intervals.
The main preliminary analyses of outcomes will be
intention-to-treat-based, accounting for clustering
(groups in intervention arm, family caregivers in fam-
ilies) using multilevel models. Single caregiver families
will be included as a cluster of size 1 .The analysis of the
proposed primary outcome for a definitive trial will
examine mean WEMWBS scores between arms at 12
months post-randomisation, with baseline WEMWBS
scores included as a covariate. The analysis will also ad-
just for randomisation factors. Remaining proposedoutcomes for a definitive trial (including outcomes at 3
months post-randomisation) will be analysed similarly,
with appropriate multilevel regression models. An ex-
ploratory complier average causal effect analysis will also
be conducted, focused on family caregivers who
complete the E-PAtS programme (see earlier definitions
of completion/adherence). Results from all regression
models will be reported using point estimates and 95%
confidence intervals.
Health economic methods/analysis plan
The feasibility study will also be used as a vehicle to: (i)
evaluate the performance of client service receipt inven-
tories (administered at baseline and at 3 months and 12
months post-randomisation) in collecting resource util-
isation; (ii) assess the availability of routine health and
social data sources that can be used to complement and
validate self-reported resource utilisation data; (iii) iden-
tify appropriate sources of unit costs for potential re-
source consequences and assess how much primary
costing research will be required for a definitive trial-
based economic evaluation; and (iv) identify the best
possible way of expressing the cost-effectiveness of the
E-PAtS programme using preference-based approaches.
Qualitative methods/analysis plan
Thematic analysis [ 41] will be used to analyse each
group of interviews (service provider organisations, facil-
itators, family caregivers) separately and independently
followed by qualitative synthesis across all interviews to
provide an over-arching synthesis of family caregivers ’
experiences and perceptions related to the study objec-
tives. A triangulation exercise will be conducted combin-
ing qualitative and quantitative data analysis results.
A full statistical analysis plan will be written by the
statistician and qualitative researcher and approved by
the study management group and study steering com-
mittee prior to any analysis taking place.
Progression criteria for a definitive trial
The following criteria will inform the decision to pro-
gress to a definitive trial, with consideration to issues
that may have affected meeting any of these criteria and
steps that can be taken to overcome these issues within
a full trial:
/C15Recruitment of families —50% of families
approached, and who are eligible, consent to the
study.
/C15Rate of recruitment —the target sample of 64
families is achieved within the study recruitment
period.
/C15Randomisation feasibility —10–16 families are
recruited in a local area of the E-PAtS serviceCoulman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:147 Page 12 of 15
provider organisation to allow randomisation and a
maximum of 8 families per E-PAtS group.
/C15Study retention —75% of primary caregivers are
retained for follow-up at 12 month data collection
point.
/C15Adherence —70% of primary caregivers and 40% of
recruited secondary caregivers adhere to the E-PAtS
programme.
/C15Fidelity —70% of E-PAtS curriculum components are
rated as partially or fully present in all recorded
group sessions available for analysis.
/C15Service provider organisation willingness to
participate in a definitive trial —a sufficient number
of training providers indicate a willingness to take
part in a definitive trial.
/C15E-PAtS intervention is sufficiently different to usual
practice
/C15Study steering committee consensus recommends
progression to a definitive trial.
Adverse event reporting
There are no expected adverse events related to the
intervention or research procedures; the University of
Warwick Humanities and Social Sciences Research Eth-
ics Committee has approved that adverse events should
not be reported for this study. Any families who are con-
sidered in crisis at screening will be referred for urgent
case management, following site-specific protocols. If
throughout the duration of the study, a member of the
study team becomes concerned regarding the wellbeing
or safety of a study participant or their child, study staff
will follow study and site-specific protocols for dealing
with harm.
Auditing
No independent audits are planned.
Study governance
Ethical approval for this study was given by the Univer-
sity of Warwick Humanities and Social Sciences Re-
search Ethics Committee on the 14th of December 2017,
reference number 30/17-18. Any protocol amendments
will be approved by the University of Warwick Human-
ities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee. A
study steering committee (SSC) will meet approximately
every 6 months to provide study oversight. The SSC
comprises two independent academic social workers
(one of whom is the Chair), an independent statistician
and a lay representative.
Confidentiality
All data will be kept for 15 years in line with Cardiff
University ’s Research Governance Framework Regula-
tions for clinical research. Electronic data will be storedconfidentially on password-protected servers maintained
on University networks. All hard copy forms will be
stored in locked filing cabinets. For participant inter-
views, all audio files will be recorded on encrypted
audio-recorders and securely held in password-protected
servers maintained on University networks. Audio files
will be transcribed and pseudonymised using University-
approved transcription companies. No identifiable data
will be published.
Dissemination policy
A publication plan and dissemination policy will be writ-
ten. The study results will be disseminated in full and
with a lay summary on the Centre for Trials Research
(CTR), University of Warwick and University of Kent
websites and a summary of the results will be dissemi-
nated to all participants. Any data requests should be
made to the CTR. The CTR is a signatory of AllTrials
and aims to make its research data available wherever
possible.
Public involvement
A Project Advisory Group (PAG) of family caregivers of
young children with ID will be established to offer rec-
ommendations for participant facing materials including
outcome measures, offer strategic advice on engaging
families, act as ambassadors for the study, create com-
munication pathways with family caregivers of young
children with ID and parent networks, to contribute to
the interpretation of the feasibility study findings and as-
sist in the co-production of dissemination outputs for
family caregivers. A face-to face meeting will take place
at least twice, supplemented by ad hoc contact via email
at study milestones. The SSC will include an independ-
ent lay representative with experience of parenting of
child with ID.
Discussion
Despite the high level of need for parents and children
with ID and the drive and commitment of the NHS to
implement early years parenting programmes, as identi-
fied in the Transforming Care (TC) programme [ 33],
there is currently a significant gap in the evidence base
and availability of suitable programmes. The E-PAtS
logic model directly addresses this gap, and its aims are
specifically aligned to reduce inequalities in service
provision and target health-focused outcomes for family
caregivers and children with ID. The results of this feasi-
bility study will contribute to the evidence base on im-
proving outcomes for children with ID and their family
caregivers. In addition, the findings from this feasibility
study will determine the progression to a definitive trial
to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the
E-PAtS intervention and will inform parameters of studyCoulman et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:147 Page 13 of 15
