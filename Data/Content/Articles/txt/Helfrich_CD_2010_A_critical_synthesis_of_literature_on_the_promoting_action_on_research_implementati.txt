Abstract
Background: The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework, or PARIHS, is a
conceptual framework that posits key, interacting elements that influence successful implementation of evidence-
based practices. It has been widely cited and used as the basis for empirical work; however, there has not yet been
a literature review to examine how the framework has been used in implementation projects and research. The
purpose of the present article was to critically review and synthesize the literature on PARIHS to understand how it
has been used and operationalized, and to highlight its strengths and limitations.
Methods: We conducted a qualitative, critical synthesis of peer-reviewed PARIHS literature published through
March 2009. We synthesized findings through a three-step process using semi-structured data abstraction tools and
group consensus.
Results: Twenty-four articles met our inclusion criteria: six core concept articles from original PARIHS authors, and
eighteen empirical articles ranging from case reports to quantitative studies. Empirical articles generally used
PARIHS as an organizing framework for analyses. No studies used PARIHS prospectively to design implementation
strategies, and there was generally a lack of detail about how variables were measured or mapped, or how
conclusions were derived. Several studies used findings to comment on the framework in ways that could help
refine or validate it. The primary issue identified with the framework was a need for greater conceptual clarity
regarding the definition of sub-elements and the nature of dynamic relationships. Strengths identified included its
flexibility, intuitive appeal, explicit acknowledgement of the outcome of ‘successful implementation, ’and a more
expansive view of what can and should constitute ‘evidence. ’
Conclusions: While we found studies reporting empirical support for PARIHS, the single greatest need for this and
other implementation models is rigorous, prospective use of the framework to guide implementation projects.
There is also need to better explain derived findings and how interventions or measures are mapped to specific
PARIHS elements; greater conceptual discrimination among sub-elements may be necessary first. In general, it may
be time for the implementation science community to develop consensus guidelines for reporting the use and
usefulness of theoretical frameworks within implementation studies.
Background
Only a small proportion of research findings are widely
translated into clinical settings [1], often due to barriers in
the local setting [2]. The Promoting Action on ResearchImplementation in Health Services framework, or PAR-
IHS, is a conceptual framework that posits key, interacting
elements that influence successful implementation of
evidence-based practices (EBPs) [3-7]. Implementation
researchers have widely cited PARIHS or used it as the
basis for empirical work [8-11]. This body of research
has occurred against the backdrop of broad calls to* Correspondence: christian.helfrich@va.gov

incorporate theoretical frameworks in quality improve-
ment implementation activities and research [12-14].
It has been over a decade since Kitson and colleagues
first described the PARIHS framework, and while severalpapers have been published that update and proposerefinements [4-7,14,15], there has not yet been a litera-
ture review to examine how the framework has been
used in implementation projects and research. Our inter-est in PARIHS grew out of its use by numerous research-ers involved in the Veterans Health Administration (VA)Quality Enhancement Research Initiative and theirexpressed need for guidance in how to use it in imple-mentation projects. The purpose of the present article isto critically review and synthesize the conceptual and
empirical literatures on PARIHS to: understand how
PARIHS has been used; understand how its elements andsub-elements have been operationalized; and highlightstrengths and limitations of PARIHS relative to use ofthe framework to guide an implementation study. Weclose with a set of recomme ndations to increase the
value of the PARIHS framework for guiding implementa-tion activities and research.
PARIHS framework
PARIHS outlines the determinants of successful imple-mentation of evidence into practice. It was initially pub-lished in 1998 as an unnamed framework inductivelydeveloped based on the experience of the authors withpractice improvement and guideline implementationefforts [3]. They presented three case examples to illus-
trate its usefulness with accompanying descriptive ana-
lyses. Subsequently, two concept analyses were publishedexploring the maturity, meaning, and characteristics offacilitation [4] and context [5] as they relate to imple-mentation. These concept analyses were based on non-systematic reviews of the literature. The original authorspublished a refined version of the framework in 2002based on theoretical insights from these concept analyses
[15]. This article contained the first published use of the
PARIHS label. A conceptual exploration of evidence waspublished in 2004, which rounded out the PARIHSteam ’s review of their framework ’s three core elements
[6]. Kitson and colleagues published a further clarifica-tion of PARIHS in 2008. This latest paper proposed thatPARIHS is best used in a two-step process: as a frame-work to diagnose and guide pr eliminary assessment of
evidence and context, and to guide development, selec-
tion, and assessment of facil itation strategies based on
the existing evidence base and local context [7].
The framework comprises three, interacting core ele-
ments: evidence (E) - ‘codified and non-codified sources of
knowledge ’[7] as perceived by multiple stakeholders; con-
text (C) - the quality of the environment or setting inwhich the research is implemented; and facilitation (F) - a‘technique by which one person makes things easier for
others, ’achieved through ‘support to help people change
their attitudes, habits, skills, ways of thinking, and working ’
[3]. The core assertion is that successful implementation isa function of E, C, and F and their interrelationships. Thestatus of each of these elements can be assessed for
whether it will have a weak ( ’low ’rating) or strong ( ‘high ’
rating) effect on implementation (Figure 1).
In the PARIHS framework, evidence consists of four
sub-elements, corresponding to four main sources ofevidence: research evidence from studies and clinicalpractice guidelines including, but not limited to, formalexperiments; clinical experience or related professionalknowledge; patient preferences and experiences; and
locally derived information or data, such as project eva-
luations or quality improvement initiatives [6,7]. A fun-damental premise of PARIHS is that while researchevidence is often treated as the most heavily weightedsource, all four sources have meaning and constituteevidence from the perspective of end users.
Context comprises four su b-elements: receptive con-
text, organizational culture , leadership, and evaluation
[5,7]. All four of these sub-elements are defined in PAR-
IHS core papers [5,7], and, for culture, leadership. andevaluation, definitions from the broader literature arecited in a related concept an alysis [5]. For example, cul-
ture is alternatively described as a ‘paradigm, ’as ‘`the
way things are done around here ’and as a metaphor for
the organization-somethin g the organization is rather
than something it possesses; leadership is described as an
i n d i c a t o ro rr e f l e c t i o no ft h e ‘nature of human relation-
ships ’in the organization, pertaining to the types of lea-
dership roles enacted and who enacts them [3,5]; andevaluation is described largely in terms of feedback [5]and how performance data are collected and reported[7]. Descriptions of the sub-elements for each are pro-vided in earlier papers that reflect ‘high ’and ‘low ’ratings
that indicate a more or less favorable context for success-
ful implementation, respectively. Indications for high rat-
ings of context include, for example: clearly defined andacknowledged physical, social, cultural, structural and/orsystem boundaries; valuing individual staff and clients;promoting organizational learning; existence of transfor-mational leadership as well as democratic or inclusivedecision making; and existence of feedback on individual,team, and/or system performance [15,16].
Facilitation includes three sub-elements and an array of
mechanisms to influence implementation of evidenceinto clinical practice. The first sub-element of facilitationfocuses on its purpose; e.g., whether facilitation is to sup-
port attainment of a specific goal (task-oriented) orenable individuals or teams to reflect on and change theirattitudes and ways of working (holistic-oriented) [15]. Inthe PARIHS framework, these two purposes are arrayedHelfrich et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:82

as endpoints on a continuum. The second and third sub-
elements of facilitation are the role of the facilitator(s)and their associated skills and attributes, which are
described for each of the two purposes. On the task-oriented end of the continuu m, the facilitator might
engage in episodic contacts and provide practical focused
help, which requires strong project management/techni-
cal skills but a relatively low level of intensity. On theholistic-oriented end of fac ilitation, the facilitator might
focus on building sustained partnerships with teams toassist them in developing their own practice changeskills. This requires a relatively high level of intensity.
Methods
We used qualitative, critical synthesis methods for thisreview because our objectives were descriptive ( e.g.,
describing how PARIHS has been used) and critical ( e.g.,
appraising relative strengths and weaknesses of the fra-mework), rather than meta-analytic ( e.g., calculating an
average effect size) [17]. We describe our review processbelow.
Search strategy and selection of publications
Our literature search included three sources. First, weconducted key word searches of the PubMed andCINAHL databases using the terms ‘PARIHS ’and ‘pro-
moting action on research implementation in health ser-vices. ’We selected PubMed beca use it represents the
preeminent database of peer-reviewed literature in thehealth fields, and CINAHL because it focuses specifically
on nursing literature, where some of the original PAR-
IHS concept papers were published. We used limitedkey words because this review was focused on the PAR-IHS model, rather than implementation models gener-ally. Second, we reviewed the reference lists of includedarticles. Third, we solicit ed citations from a PARIHS
author and other colleagues familiar with this body ofresearch.
We selected articles based on four ap r i o r i criteria:
published peer-reviewed literature, English language,published prior to March 2009, and explicit reference tothe PARIHS framework either by name or citation ofcore conceptual articles. We did not specify ap r i o r i
exclusion criteria.
Appraisal and abstraction of articles
We appraised and abstracted include articles in a three-step process. First, each article was read by a primaryreviewer who wrote a narrative synopsis using a tem-plate (see Additional File 1, Synopsis template). The
purpose of the initial synopsis was to provide an overallsummary and critique of the article. Second, the com-pleted synopsis was distributed and reviewed by all co-authors, and discussed and refined on a conference call.Third, one of the co-authors condensed each synopsis
using a structured summary table, with a separate tablefor each article. The purpose of the summary tables wasto create a concise, structured appraisal and critique foreach article. Some papers were empirical and otherswere conceptual. Summary tables for empirical articles
included the overall method/design, an appraisal of
study quality, study outcomes, how PARIHS was pro-posed to be used and actually used, and assessment ofcongruency between PARIHS and study methods (seeAdditional File 2, Empirical article summary table).These tables also listed how PARIHS elements and sub-elements were defined and measured or operationalizedin the study, along with findings, barriers, and enablers
to implementation. The summary tables for core con-
cept articles focused on the framework ’se l e m e n t s ,s u b -
elements, limitations, recommendations, and otherobservations (Additional Fi le 3, Core-concept article
summary table). These summary tables were reviewedby the primary reviewer for that paper and again by allco-authors, discussed as a group, and affirmed or revisedas needed. This collection of empirical and core sum-
mary tables constituted the analytic foundation for our
meta-summary and synthesis.
Meta-summary and synthesis
Four co-authors reviewed the final set of summarytables and independently highlighted key points per arti-cle to create a meta-summary. Key points representedconcepts, specific findings related to PARIHS generally
and/or to specific elements or sub-elements, observa-
tions about the use of the framework, and conclusions.Information highlighted as ak e yp o i n tb ya tl e a s tt h r e e
of the four co-authors was discussed further at a two-day, in-person working conference. The purpose of thediscussion of key points was to explore and summarizesimilarities and differences across the papers (bothempirical and core conceptual) and to develop qualita-
tive themes. Some of the themes were descriptive, e.g.,
regarding the actual versus articulated use of PARIHS.Other themes were interpretive, e.g.,o u rc o n s e n s u s
judgments regarding overall limitations, related issues,and strengths of the framework relative to the ability ofresearchers to effectively use it to guide an implementa-tion study. We developed implications for using the fra-mework as well as related recommendations based on
these synthesized findings. As with the article appraisal,
the synthesis and recommendations were discussed withall co-authors and refined until consensus was reached.
Results
Search results
We initially identified 33 unique articles (Figure 2). Weexcluded an unpublished doctoral dissertation [18], andHelfrich et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:82
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/82Page 4 of 20
eight commentaries [19-26]. Commentaries did not
reflect planned or actual application or refinement of
PARIHS (See Additional File 4, Table of commentaries
excluded from the synthesis). We included the remain-
ing 24 articles in our review.
We characterized six articles as core concept articles
(Table 1 Overview of core concept articles for the PAR-
IHS framework). These were written by members of a
PARIHS coordinating group (http://www.PARIHS.org/
pages/contact_us.html) for the stated purpose of intro-
ducing [3] or elaborating on the framework, either as a
whole [7,15], or on one of its three core elements [4-6].
The remaining 18 articles (Table 2 Overview of empiri-
cal articles included in the synthesis) were a mix of case
reports and qualitative or mixed-methods studies
[27-33], quantitative studi es [9-11,34-36], literature
reviews [37-39] and study protocols [40] or frameworks[41]. We refer to these collectively as empirical articles
to distinguish them from the core concept articles.
Two of the empirical articles reported on the same
s t u d yi nw h i c ht h eC o n t e x t Assessment Instrument
(CAI) was developed based on PARIHS [35,36]. We also
obtained an unpublished final report for the project
[42], which included all of the material in the two arti-
cles plus more methodological detail. We combined
these sources into a single entry in Tables 3 and 4,
yielding 17 study entries.
How and why PARIHS was used in studies
Empirical studies generally used PARIHS as an organiz-
ing framework for analyses, such as examining predictors
of nurses ’research utilization (RU) [9,10,34], or reporting
findings, such as highlighting differences between a series
of efficacy studies and a planned translational study [40]

(Table 2 Overview of empiric al articles included in the
synthesis).
Stated reasons for using PARIHS included that it
acknowledges the complexity of implementation (orknowledge translation) [39]; it includes contextual fac-tors [38]; and that it explicitly includes and describescontext and facilitation [30]. Generally, users referred tothe intuitive appeal of the t hree main elements (evi-
dence, context, and facilitation) and PARIHS ’s explicit
acknowledgement of the complex interrelationshipsamong elements and their effects on implementation.Five empirical articles provided no explicit rationale forselecting PARIHS.
How PARIHS elements were operationalized
Three empirical papers described development of survey
instruments based on PARIHS, two exclusively on the
same survey assessing the element of context [35,36]and the other on evidence and context [11]. A series ofthree studies mapped survey items from secondary data-sets to PARIHS elements, and tested their associationwith nurses ’RU: one focused on context [34], and two
on context and facilitation [9,10]. Except for a study bythe PARIHS team [8], the empirical articles were not
designed to validate or refine PARIHS.
Among non-quantitative empirical articles, two pro-
vided details of how PARIHS was operationalized: onespecified questions used in a program evaluation [33],and another proposed a PARIHS-based framework toenhance reflective professional practice [41]. The nineremaining empirical articles did not specify how elementsand sub-elements were measured or assessed, such as
coding definitions or logic models for drawing conclu-sions about observed relationships.
A critical appraisal of reviewed studies
A key strength of the existing PARIHS literature (Table 3Core concept articles, and Table 4 Empirical articles) wasthat several studies used findings to comment on the fra-
mework in ways that could help refine or validate it. One
example was a suggestion to address underlying motiva-tion for change, such as relative advantage and tension forchange [27,28]. Another was a qualitative exploration bythe PARIHS team of how the framework fit with empiricalfindings [29]. A series of three articles attempted to quan-tify measures of context and facilitation and test quantita-tive multi-level models using facilitation and context as
predictors of RU by nurses [9,10,34].
We identified two major issues with the PARIHS litera-
ture through our review. First, none of the studies usedPARIHS prospectively to design implementation strategies.With the exception of articles reporting on survey devel-opment [11,35,36], all of the empirical studies were retro-spective or cross-sectional. The six core concept papersdescribed analyses that were conducted at a high level
addressing broad concepts, and relied on non-systematic
review of the literature.
Second, there was significant lack of detail about how
variables were measured [39], mapped to PARIHS ele-m e n t s[ 3 8 ] ,o rh o wr e s u l t so rc o n c l u s i o n sw e r ed e r i v e d[33].

individuals ’on the ‘low ’end and ‘patient centered ’on the ‘high ’end) (p. 151).
Sources considered ‘high ’research evidence are limited. Culture seems to
include everything and lacks clarity. Does not differentiate external facilitationversus internal facilitation ( e.g., through management or champions). Judges task-
oriented facilitation as ‘low ’and ‘holistic ’facilitation as ‘high. ’Some concepts
seem conflated ( e.g., receptive context includes ‘inclusive decision-making
processes ’which seems equally related to sub-element of leadership).
Proposed as a diagnostic tool to help prepare the context and select the most
appropriate intervention but supportive studies were limited and retrospective.Strengths:
Theory paper that proposes PARIHS as an inductively developed framework to
help understand complex implementations.Issues:
Rationale for mapping findings from sample studies into PARIHS elements is
unclear and loose. For example, in one case, physicians rejected evidence-basedguidelines and the authors attribute this to inadequate facilitation without clearrationale for the attribution.
Harvey 2002 J Adv Nurs Strengths:
Authors suggested that there is some evidence that facilitators may help
change clinical and organizational practice, although current data limited theirability to make conclusions.Issues:Regardless of their suggested changes to the framework per the literature, the
authors point out that further research is still needed on this inherent part of the
framework, i.e., regarding different models of facilitation.
Definitional clarity in related sub-elements remains an issue; and some
promising, potential sub-elements identified in the paper did not make it intotheir suggested refinements.Strengths:
Literature review included ‘analysis of a broad range of health care literature. ’
(p. 579). Provided information on the level of maturity of the facilitation concept.Provided information for model refinement.
Pointed out the need for more research on different models of facilitation; e.g.,
the need to better differentiate external and/or internal facilitation.
Issues:

Missing details about how the analysis was conducted, beyond authors ’brief
description of Morse (1995) and Morse et al. ’s (1996) approach.
McCormack 2002 J Adv Nurs Strengths:
Provided some substantiation of contextual elements; especially for holistic view
of implementation.
Provided some conceptual backing.
Evolved a sub-element in context from measurement to evaluation.
Issues:Concept of context lacks clarity because of the many ways it is characterized; e.
g.,‘what is clear from studies reviewed that have included a consideration of
context is that there is inconsistency in the use of the term and that this has animpact on claims of its importance. Thus the implications of using context as a
variable in research studies exploring research implementation are as yet largely
unknown. ’p. 101.
Muddles whether Context is an overarching element or a sub-element on equal
footing with Culture, Leadership, Evaluation that needs to be subsumed undersome other broader category: i.e.,‘the analysis of the characteristics and
consequences of context suggests that other characteristics are equally
important...and that these sub-elements need to be taken into account in any
articulation of the concept of context. ’p. 101.Strengths:
Draws on broader literature addressing context.
Issues:
Key details of methodology missing, including parameters such as years
covered by search and numbers of articles reviewed and included.Seemed to focus more on holistic organizational change versus task-oriented
implementation.Helfrich et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:82

settings with poor context, but not both poor context and
poor facilitation. However, the authors did not indicatewhich cases supported those conclusions and what char-acterized context and facilitation at those sites [30].
A critical appraisal of the PARIHS framework
Several overarching strengths of PARIHS emerged(Table 3 Core concept articles, and Table 4 Empiricalarticles). First, though studies have not done so to date,the developers describe an explicit method for usingPARIHS to guide diagnosti c analysis of evidence and
context [7], findings from which should be used to planfacilitation strategies to accomplish implementation.
Second are its flexibility and applicability to a range of
settings, as well as perceptions by users that it captureskey elements of the implementation experience. This
includes PARIHS ’expansive acknowledgement of what
can and should constitute ‘evidence, ’and its recognition
that implementation is a complex and multi-facetedprocess that is dynamic and often unpredictable. InTable 4: Empirical articles (Continued)

additional, several articles reported findings that support
specific PARIHS elements or sub-elements, such asEstabrooks and colleagues ’finding that measures of
facilitation and context are significantly associated withnurses ’RU [10].
The primary issue related to the framework was a
need for greater conceptual clarity about the definitions
of sub-elements and the nature of dynamic relationshipsamong elements and sub-elements. In many cases, sub-elements appear to have significant conceptual overlap.For example, criteria for evaluating receptive contextinclude ‘power and authority processes ’and whether or
not cultural boundaries are clearly defined and acknowl-edged. These two criteria appear to overlap with the cul-
ture and leadership sub-ele ments, which include being
‘able to define culture(s) in terms of prevailing values/
beliefs ’and ‘democratic inclusive decision making pro-
cesses. ’It is not clear what distinguishes receptive con-
text, as a construct, from culture and leadership.Another example is that facilitation is defined solely as arole, and in terms of the individual who fills the roleand the relationship they have with those implementing
the change. As presently described, this element does
not address implementation interventions such asreminders, web-based education, toolkits, social market-ing, and audit and feedback that may be undertaken tofacilitate implemen tation, and which c ould conceivably
be untaken by a number of actors. Although PARIHSacknowledges the dynamic relationships among ele-ments, the elements and sub-elements are described in
linear terms, from ‘low ’to ‘high, ’with little explicit
account of how or in what form dynamics among andacross the sub-elements might emerge.
Both a strength and issue for PARIHS was the specifi-
cation of the outcome ‘successful implementation. ’It
was a strength in that the framework stipulates an out-come where many implementation models do not. How-ever, there was little information in the six core articles
about how to conceptualize or define successful imple-
mentation, and the empirical articles adopted a range ofoutcomes. Some articles used a broad outcome of RU[10,39], i.e., the degree to which clinicians apply
research knowledge in their practices generally. Othersused the degree of implementation or uptake of specificpractice changes [30,31].
Discussion
Our objectives in the present synthesis were to under-stand how PARIHS has been used in implementationstudies, how it has been operationalized, and thestrengths and limitations of PARIHS and its supportingliterature. We found a reasonably large published litera-ture (33 published papers, 18 of which were empirical),b u tt h i si sab o d yo ff i n d i n g st h a tr e f l e c t sm a n yo ft h ecurrent limitations of the broader implementation
science literature. These limitations provide great oppor-tunities for improvement, notably three.
First, PARIHS was largely used and operationalized as
an organizing device or heuristic, usually post hoc . How-
ever, PARIHS developers intended the framework to be
used to assess evidence and context prior to implemen-
tation and then using these findings to guide facilitationof implementation. To move the framework forward, weneed empirical studies that use PARIHS to prospectivelydesign or comprehensively evaluate implementationactivities. Researchers should explain the degree towhich intervention design decisions and change strate-gies are based on PARIHS. The lack of prospective
implementation studies is not unique to PARIHS; all
but a fraction of published i mplementation studies fail
to explicitly use any theory at all [43,44], so researchersdo not appear to be conducting prospective implemen-tation studies based on any conceptual frameworks; asimilar lack of theoretical foundation is reported amongstudies of organizational factors linked to patient safety[45]. Our findings echo those of Kajermo and colleagues
in a recent literature synthesis on use of the BARRIER
scale, which is intended to prospectively identify barriersto research use by nurses [46]. Based on a paucity ofprospective studies, they concluded that no furtherdescriptive studies should be done, and that only pro-spective studies would move the science forward. Weextend the same call for studies using PARIHS.
Second, though a strength of the empirical literature
was that some studies showed empirical support for
PARIHS, this finding needs to be interpreted in light ofthe overall study designs, which were retrospective casereports or cross-sectional analyses, and often lacked keymethodological details. Furthermore, authors rarely con-trasted findings to previous studies; the citation of priorwork using PARIHS occurred almost exclusively in theintroduction to set the stage for the study or conceptual
rationale of the study. This too, may in part, be a func-
tion of the current development of the implementationscience literature, and the natural evolution of standardsand expectations about what d etails researchers most
need to report. It may be time for something akin toCONSORT [47] or MOOSE [48] guidelines for report-ing results of implementation intervention studies orimplementation project evaluations. While implementa-
tion science may not be amenable to the same manner
of checklists that have been applied to randomized trialsand meta-analyses, there are key elements that could bedescribed in sufficient specificity to provide guidance toboth journal editors and researchers. These mightinclude an explanation or rationale for mapping studyfindings to the constructs of the conceptual frameworkbeing used; a rationale for excluding certain elements;Helfrich et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:82
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/82Page 16 of 20
details about operationalization of constructs, including
coding definitions for qualitative analyses; and discus-sion of the criteria authors use to draw conclusionsabout relationships between determinants and imple-mentation outcomes. This might help address a key cri-ticism of efforts to promote more theory-based
implementation research, namely that translation of the-
ory into intervention design is too subjective and opa-que [49].
Finally, there are opportunities to improve the concep-
tual clarity of the framework itself, including refiningconceptual definitions to more clearly draw distinctionsamong related sub-elements, such as receptive context,leadership, and culture. This will help provide for more
rigorous studies by making it easier for users to map
measures back to PARIHS consistently, derive testablehypotheses using the framework, and design more effec-tive implementation strategies. We have drafted animplementation guide, being published separately, whichdiscusses in more detail recommendations for thoseusing PARIHS in task-oriented implementation projectsand research, or seeking to refine the framework. Below,
we briefly discuss three specific opportunities to refine
the PARIHS framework.
First, PARIHS acknowledges the dynamic relationships
among elements and sub-elements in the frameworkand the often unpredictable nature of implementation.However, dynamic implies th at elements/sub-elements
interact or act as modifiers or contingencies, such thatt h ee f f e c t so fo n ei sd e p e n d e n to no t h e r s[ 5 0 ] .A sa
result, the same implementation intervention may have
wildly different effects in different settings [51]. PARIHSw o u l db es t r e n g t h e n e de v e nm o r eb yb e g i n n i n gt odescribe how those dynamics might emerge and provideexamples that could eventually help identify more gen-eralizable patterns. Identifying and describing all poten-tial interactions is clearly i mpossible, but currently,
PARIHS elements are described on a continuum, low to
high, that strongly implies linear relationships, which are
inconsistent both with the broader concept of PARIHSas a dynamic model and with available evidence. Forexample, we have prospective studies that find seniorleadership support changes dramatically over time, withsenior leaders shifting among roles ranging from institu-tional mentors for the change to critics of it [52]; andthat senior leadership support is not always a strong dri-
ver and certainly not always a necessary condition for
implementation [53,54]. It may be possible to identifygeneralizable contextual interactions, such as senior lea-dership support being necessary for EBPs that involvecoordination across depar tments or services, require
large capital investments o r lack strong professional
endorsement.In part, the lack of specifics about interactions among
elements may arise from PARIHS straddling the linebetween a higher order planned action (or prescriptive)theory (PAT) for use by change agents to guide theirimplementation strategy, and a classical (or descriptive/explanatory) model meant to describe or explain how
change occurs. The core concept articles explicitly pro-
pose that PARIHS be used to guide implementation byassessing evidence and context in order to inform facili-tation, strongly positioning PARIHS as a prescriptivemodel, albeit not with the detail of a PAT as describedby Graham and Tetroe [53].
Second, we also noted that a more explicit definition
for ‘successful implementation ’is needed. This again is
both a key strength of the framework and an opportunity
to strengthen it. A clear def inition of successful imple-
mentation is critical for moving implementation scienceliterature forward, and we may do well to draw on the lit-eratures of other disciplines. For example, researchers ineducation [55] and health pr omotion [56] have written
specifically about criteria for determining when new pro-grams are fully implemented. Likewise, scholars in man-
agement have written about conceptual considerations
for defining effective implementation of new practicessuch as IT systems [57] and banking practices [58],including distinguishing implementation from ‘compli-
ant ’use that is either incomplete or likely to degrade.
Conceptually, successful implementation might com-
prise three distinct aspects, identified as part of ouraforementioned implementation Guide. All represent
seemingly necessary conditions for concluding that a
project has achieved successful implementation: realiza-tion of the implementation pl an or strategy; achieve-
ment and maintenance of the targeted EBP; andachievement and maintenance of end-point patient ororganizational outcomes. These three componentsreflect a logic model linking an implementation strategyto ultimate outcomes. This definition of successful
implementation affords an understanding of when and
how an implementation program has delivered the ben-efits as hypothesized. To accomplish that, we need toassess whether the implementation strategy occurred asplanned, whether the EBP was established as needed,and whether desired outcomes followed.
Third, other conceptual models should be drawn on
and compared to better elaborate the core PARIHS ele-
ments or to better position work using PARIHS in the
broader literature. The PARIHS core concept papersmake it clear that the developers envision PARIHSbeing used in combination with other conceptual frame-works. Findings in some of the studies suggest the valueof making additional attributes of the evidence-basedchange more explicit such as those identified in Rogers ’Helfrich et al .Implementation Science 2010, 5:82

Diffusion of Innovation framework [34]. For example,
Rogers ’innovation attribute of the observability of a
new practice ( i.e., the extent to which its use by an indi-
vidual is readily perceived by others in their social net-work) [2,59] does not appear to have an analogue inPARIHS. These types of comparisons and extensions
would help build cumulative knowledge and inform
refinements to the framework.
The PARIHS authors continue to revisit and refine the
framework, recognize its limitations, and call for furtherresearch [7]. We consider a critical strength of any fra-mework. Researchers [60] an d practitioners [61] con-
t i n u et ou s eP A R I H Sa n dw ee x p e c tm o r er i g o r o u sstudies will be published. Already in the period since we
completed our literature search, we are aware of at least
five new publications citing PARIHS including two arti-cles presenting results of validations of survey instru-ments based on the framework [62,63]. Also, severalprospective research studies based on the framework arein progress by both the PAR IHS team (http://www.par-
ihs.org) and other research teams, including one con-ducting research in Vietnam and several conducting
research in the Veterans Health Administration QUERI
program within the US.
Limitations
Our review had two limitations. First, we did not assessthe ‘gray ’or unpublished literat ure or publications in
languages other than English. In doing so, we may havemissed important work relating to PARIHS.
Second, we focused exclusively on the PARIHS frame-
work, and not on literature regarding other frameworksthat may include similar or related constructs. Doing sowas beyond the scope of our synthesis, though we docomment on the need for greater comparison and lin-kages between PARIHS and other frameworks.
Some may also view our methods as limited because
we did not conduct a quantitative meta-analysis. How-
ever, we used methods appropriate to our research
questions and to the literature being reviewed, whichincluded few quantitative studies. We also took severalsteps to increase the transparency and reliability of ourresults.
Summary
The single greatest need for r esearchers using PARIHS,
and other implementation models, is to use the frame-
work prospectivel y and comprehensively, and evaluate
that use relative to its perceived strengths and issues forenhancing successful imple mentation. Ultimately, the
proof of any implementation framework is its demon-strated usefulness in pract ical terms to design imple-
mentation interventions and make implementation moreeffective under various conditions. Studies using the fra-
mework in this way will move the whole field forward.
Researchers using PARIHS in studies or to guide
action research should clearly explain how PARIHS isused and how interventions or measures map to specificPARIHS elements. For exampl e, studies of facilitation
activities should explain how facilitation purpose, role
and skills and attributes were defined or taken intoaccount. Other reviews have similarly called for more
explicit and detailed explanation of how theory is usedin implementation studies [43,44]. It may be time forthe implementation science community to develop con-sensus guidelines for what should be reported.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Synopsis template . The synopsis template is a semi-
structured form for initial narrative abstraction and critique of the
included articles. It included the article abstract and six sections to befilled out by the reviewer, such as aspects of the PARIHS framework saidto influence the study.
Additional file 2: Summary table template for empirical articles .T h e
summary table template is a semi-structured tool for article abstractionand critique that was in tabular format and included more discrete dataelements than the synopsis template, e.g., broken down by PARIHS
element and sub-element. The summary table differed between the
core-concept and empirical articles because of the types of publication(e.g., differences in the purposes and methods of the papers). This is the
summary table for the empirical articles.
Additional file 3: Summary table template for core concept articles .
The summary table template is a semi-structured tool for articleabstraction and critique that was in tabular format and included morediscrete data elements than the synopsis template, e.g., broken down by
PARIHS element and sub-element synthesis. The summary table differed
between the core-concept and empirical articles because of the types of
publication and related content ( e.g., differences in the purposes and
methods of the papers). This is the summary table for the core conceptarticles.
Additional file 4: Commentaries excluded from the synthesis . This is
a table of eight papers that were reviewed as part of our literaturereview and ultimately excluded because we defined them ascommentaries that neither presented empirical research related to
PARIHS nor conceptual critique or elaboration of the framework. The
table includes abstracted data on the purpose of paper; the rationale forusing PARIHS; and how PARIHS was to be used.
