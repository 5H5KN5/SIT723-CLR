Abstract 
Introduction Adolescents who drop out of sport often report  that  it had become less ‘fun’ and ‘enjoyable’  over time. 
Although preadolescent sport typically emphasizes experiences of fun, emphases on competition and elite perfor -
mance often dominate during adolescence. We theorized that adherence to adolescent sport  might be improved 
if the overarching goal were to maximize repeated experiences of fun during sport and, subsequently, increase reflec-
tive evaluations of sport enjoyment. To that end, this manuscript reports on the rationale and design of the PlayFit 
Youth Sport Program (PYSP), as well as its preliminary feasibility and acceptability. The main objectives were to evalu-
ate the feasibility of  recruitment strategies and data collection procedures and the acceptability of the intervention.
Setting An outdoor, multipurpose grass field at a south-central Pennsylvania middle school.
Methods A mixed-methods, single-arm feasibility trial lasting for 8 weeks (August–October 2021) offered 3-times 
per week for 1-h per session. The equipment, ruleset, and psychosocial environment of the PYSP sport games were 
modified to reduce several of the constraints theorized to impair experiences of fun during sport and hamper reflec-
tive evaluations of enjoyment afterward. 
Results Eleven healthy, but sedentary adolescents in grades 5–7 completed the program. The median number 
of sessions attended (of 16 possible) was 12 (range = 6–13). Post-intervention, 9/10 respondents indicated that they 
‘looked forward’ to the PYSP , 8/10 would recommend it to a friend, and 8/10 were interested in continuing the pro -
gram. Ten  of 11 participant guardians expressed interest in reenrolling their children if the PYSP were offered again. 
Some changes recommended were to improve recruitment via advertising the positive aspects of the program 
and “word of mouth” techniques, offering the program immediately following the school day, having contingencies 
for inclement weather, and minor changes to the sport equipment to improve the experience among the population 
the PYSP intends to attract.
Conclusions The adjustments recommended in this preliminary work could be used to further refine the PYSP . 
A future efficacy trial could explore whether the PYSP may reduce attrition for adolescents who experience existing 
sport programs negatively by offering an alternative that better matches their unique needs and preferences.

Key messages regarding feasibility
• What uncertainties existed regarding  feasibility?
◦ We were unsure whether sedentary adolescents 
would express interest, enroll, and adhere to the 
PlayFit Youth Sport Program (PYSP). In addition, we 
wondered whether the time of day, duration, and fre -
quency of sessions were ideal for participant recruit -
ment and retention.
• What are the key feasibility findings?
◦  Ninety-two percent of  adolescents who enrolled 
completed the PYSP intervention and 80% expressed 
interest in continuing to participate.  Additionally, we 
learned that offering sessions earlier in the day (e.g., 
following school) and having contingencies in place 
for inclement weather (i.e., ability to move indoors), 
could increase the number of sessions available and 
daily attendance. The participants also offered sug -
gestions to improve the experience via minor changes 
to the sport equipment of the games.
• What are the implications of the feasibility findings 
for the design of the main study?
◦ The PYSP intervention could be a promising 
approach to physical activity promotion among sed -
entary adolescents, but alternative advertising strate -
gies may be required to increase recruitment. Prior 
to conducting an efficacy trial of the PYSP , the rec -
ommendations for improvement gathered from the 
present study should be considered.
Introduction
Recent estimates suggest that approximately one-third of 
youth sport participants drop out annually and 70% of all 
children will have done so by 13 years of age [1–3]. More -
over, up to 80% of adolescents are insufficiently active 
[4–9], suggesting that those who drop out of sport may 
not be substituting physical activity (PA) through sport -
with participation in alternative physical activities. These 
inactive children may be less likely to realize the many 
physical and mental health benefits [10–15] of regular 
PA. Inactivity during childhood also tends to track into 
adulthood [16–18] —meaning it  could become inter -
generational—as adults often influence the PA behavior 
of their children [19, 20]. Despite these concerns, inter -
ventions that reduce, and, perhaps, reverse youth sport attrition have been characterized as  ‘urgently needed’ 
since at least the 1980s [21–23].
There are numerous explanations for adolescent sport 
attrition (e.g., lack of time, competing priorities, poor 
access, high costs; [24– 27], but one deserving more atten -
tion could be that those who drop out of sport frequently 
report that it was no longer fun  and enjoyable [28– 31]. 
While most youth athlete development models [32, 33] 
suggest that childhood sport should maximize experi -
ences of fun  and enjoyment, adolescent sport program -
ming often focuses on elite performance, competitive 
success, and progressing athletes to the ‘next level’ [22, 
23, 33, 34]. ‘Having fun’ during sport may be incompat -
ible with these outcomes [35], as those who play to have 
fun are seen as ‘carefree’ [36] ’goofing off, ’ or ’not caring’ 
about the outcome [37]. Perhaps due to this negative con -
notation, the term ’fun’ appears frequently in the earlier 
(i.e., younger) stages of the Developmental Model of Sport 
Participation [32] and Long-Term Athlete Development 
Model [33] but receives little attention in later stages. 
This shift toward focusing on performance and competi -
tion  outcomes could introduce several of the  intraper -
sonal, interpersonal, and structural constraints that are 
theorized to reduce experiences of fun [30].
Ideally, so-called recreational sport would provide an 
alternative to elite and competitive sport for adolescents 
who wish to participate primarily to have fun. Indeed, 
the explicit missions of  many recreational sport organi -
zations are to provide programming that balances fun, 
enjoyment, performance, and competition [38, 39]. At 
the same time, ‘recreational’ is a nebulous term, meaning 
what characterizes recreational sport can vary depend -
ing on the organization and its administrators. Moreover, 
the personalities, expertise, and training of the (often) 
volunteer coaches influence the participant experience 
[38, 40–42]. That is, recreational sport leaders are often 
current or former athletes who are well-versed in sport 
knowledge, but may have little coaching experience or 
expertise in positive  youth development and motiva -
tion [38]. Consequently, the  experience of recreational 
sport programs may closely resemble more ‘traditional’ 
competitive and elite  programs—leaving many adoles -
cents without programming to meet their unique needs 
and preferences. We suggest that, to mitigate youth sport 
attrition, an alternative pathway must be developed for 
those who negatively experience existing youth sport 
programming. The PlayFit Youth Sport Program (PYSP) 
could serve as one such alternative.

Rationale for the PlayFit Youth Sport Program
Dual-process theories [43] guided the development of the 
PYSP . Dual process theories suggest that decision making 
is underpinned by the interactions between automatic 
associations and reflective (i.e.,  cognitive) evaluations. 
Accordingly, we suggest that sport becomes automati -
cally associated with ’fun’ when a player repeatedly and 
consistently experiences pleasure and positive emotions 
during  participation. Afterward, the  player more slowly 
and deliberatively reflects on the quality of their experi -
ences during sport. A player may, for example, consider 
whether the experience  fostered perceptions of compe -
tence, autonomy, and relatedness [44]. These retrospec -
tive evaluations coalesce to form an overall positive or 
negative reflective evaluation of sport. Critically, dual-
process theories suggest that behavior is more likely when 
automatic associations and reflective evaluations are con -
cordant [45]. That is, a player who both automatically 
associates sport with fun and has a positive reflective 
evaluation of it is more likely to participate than some -
one who has high perceived sport competence but does 
not automatically associate sport with being fun. Conse -
quently, the  philosophy of the PYSP is that repeated and 
consistent experiences of fun should be the ‘prime direc -
tive’ (i.e., principal emphasis) that supersedes all others 
(e.g., changes in fitness, skillfulness, performance).
The PYSP leverages several theoretical models and  
empirical findings to help mitigate the myriad con -
straints [30] that may reduce experiences of fun during  
and degrade reflective evaluations after  sport partici -
pation. For instance, fun-integration theory (FIT; [46] 
posits that three ‘fun-dimensions’ (i.e., ‘trying hard, ’ 
‘positive team dynamics, ’ and ‘positive coaching’) are 
important influences on fun during sport. Moreover, 
sport programming that fulfills the basic psychologi -
cal needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness 
[44] may lead to increased positive emotional expe -
riences, stemming from perceptions of competent 
performances or playing with friends. In addition, 
experiences of fun during sport may be greater if the 
program culture matches the goal orientations [47] of 
the participants. That is, those with task (or mastery) 
goal-orientations may have less fun during sport if the 
culture encourages interpersonal comparisons of abil -
ity and performance instead of perceptions of personal 
achievement.
Findings from exercise psychology could also help 
augment the experience of fun during sport. For exam -
ple, there is considerable interindividual  variability in 
the affective responses (pleasure-displeasure) elicited 
by  differing exercise intensities. Specifically, some peo -
ple report feeling better,  and others worse, during vig -
orous-intensity exercise. [48]. Moreover, many children and younger adolescents report decreasing pleasure 
throughout continuous and incremental exercise [49, 50]. 
Allowing these individuals to self-regulate their physical 
effort (i.e., slow down or stop if experiencing discomfort/
displeasure) without negative consequences (e.g., being 
punished or shamed) may increase their experiences of 
fun during sport and improve their  subsequent reflec -
tive evaluations. Finally, evidence from youth PA pat -
terning [51, 52] suggests that children tend to gravitate 
toward  movements that closely approximate the game -
play of ’tag’ (i.e., intermittent light-to moderate-intensity 
PA, with shorter bursts of vigorous-intensity activity 
interspersed throughout). Sport programming that mir -
rors these  seemingly inherent movement propensities 
may be more likely to be experienced as fun by children. 
Table  1 outlines in more detail how and where previous 
these theoretical models and empirical  findings were 
incorporated into the design of the PYSP .
Study objectives
The present study was designed to explore the prelimi -
nary feasibility and acceptability of the PYSP program  to 
understand whether a future efficacy trial may be war -
ranted. Because the terms pilot and feasibility are often 
used interchangeably, distinguishing between them can 
be difficult. For instance, Whitehead and colleagues 
[53] suggested that, in contrast to feasibility studies, 
pilot studies have stricter study methodology, an explicit 
intention for future work, are smaller versions of the 
primary trials (i.e., they often include randomization to 
groups), and focus on trial outcomes. We considered 
the present work a  feasibility study as it was “iterative, 
formative, and adaptive [54]” and used flexible method -
ology that allowed changes to be made when necessary 
to improve intervention delivery [55]. To investigate the 
feasibility (i.e., the extent to which procedures are suc -
cessfully delivered in a distinctive context that is not fully 
controlled) and acceptability (i.e., the extent to which 
procedures are perceived as fit, satisfying, and appealing) 
of the PYSP , we adapted the social and behavioral feasi -
bility study data collection and evaluation framework 
suggested by Orsmond and colleagues [54] that included 
the following criteria (see Table 2 for more details):
1. Recruitment capability and resulting sample charac -
teristics.
2. Evaluation and refinement of data collection proce -
dures and outcome.
3. Acceptability and suitability of intervention and 
study procedures.
4. Resources and ability to manage and implement the 
study and intervention.

• Leaders value and praise prosocial behaviors 
(e.g., players who encourage one another, pass 
to teammates who do not frequently receive 
one, allowing another player to have a ’re-do’)

Method
Trial design and setting
A mixed-methods single-arm feasibility trial describing a 
formative version of the PYSP . All study activities took place 
in south-central Pennsylvania in the midst of the COVID-
19 pandemic. As recommended by the editorial board for 
non-randomized feasibility studies focused on interven -
tion development [56], our findings are reported using 
the applicable items from the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT)—extension to randomized 
pilot and feasibility trials [57] (see Supplementary files for 
CONSORT diagram).  Human-subjects approval for the 
study was provided by the Institutional Review Board.
Participants
We aimed to recruit up to 20 participants for this study. 
Males or females between the ages of 10 and 12 years of 
age who were healthy enough for physical activity [58], 
but sedentary (defined as participating in fewer than 
60-min of moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activ -
ity; [MVPA] per day) [59] were included. Individuals 
were excluded if they were unable to speak and read Eng -
lish, could not assent both verbally and in writing, and/or 
those whose guardians did not provide written informed 
consent. The participants were compensated for answer -
ing questionnaires at baseline and week 8.
Intervention delivery
The local public school district provided a multi-use field 
to host the PYSP sessions. We offered 8 weeks of outdoor 
PYSP sessions from August–October 2021. The program was offered from 6  pm–7  pm 3  days per week (Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday). The outdoor grass playing area 
was demarcated using plastic cones and was 100’ × 50’ (i.e., 
approximately the size of a regulation basketball court). 
This  size was chosen deliberately to bring players closer 
to one another, allowing more ‘touches’ during games, and 
to increase the feasibility of conducting indoor sessions in 
subsequent versions of the program. Because we offered the 
program during the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented 
several safety precautions suggested by amateur and profes -
sional sport agencies and required by the university (e.g., 
pre-participation health screenings, temperature checks 
upon arrival). However, mask wearing was not required.
The sport game played changed at the beginning of 
each week, rotating between Ultimate Frisbee, Ultimate 
football, handball, netball, and soccer (see Table  3 for full 
game rules and equipment). Each session began with a 
5-min warm-up period of ‘catch’ between participants 
using the sport implement of the day (e.g., ball, Frisbee). 
Following the warm-up period, the leader reviewed the 
rules of each game and selected teams randomly. Because 
the participants were sedentary and nearly 50% had never 
participated in an  organized sport, play periods during 
the first 2  weeks were 6-min long (i.e., 30-min of total 
playing time) followed by a 5-min hydration and sociali -
zation break, to allow adaptation to increased PA. Dur -
ing the remaining 6  weeks, each period was 8  min (i.e., 
40  min of total playing time) followed by 3-min breaks. 
The leader also played, switching teams after each period. 
See Table  3 for a more detailed explanation of PYSP rules 
and equipment.

site, and report any adverse events, while participants 
could report them via a monthly survey or by contacting 
research staff.
Adolescent acceptability questionnaires
Program satisfaction was measured at week 8 using 
several face-valid items. The first item asked, ‘Would 
you recommend PlayFit to a friend?’ (Yes/No). If yes, 
participants were presented with a ‘Net Promoter 
Score’ item [61] asking how likely they were to rec -
ommend the PlayFit program to a friend, using a scale 
of 0 (‘Not at all likely’) to 10 (‘Extremely likely’). The next item asked, ‘Do you look forward to doing Play -
Fit?’ (Yes/No). If yes, participants responded to the 
following question ‘I look forward to doing PlayFit… ’ 
with the options being 1 (‘Not very much’), 2 (‘ A lit -
tle’), and 3 (‘Very much’). Participants rated the next 
item ‘How would you feel if you could no longer do 
PlayFit?’ using the options 1 (‘Very disappointed’), 2 
(‘Somewhat disappointed’), or 3 (‘Not disappointed’). 
The participants next provided their rating of the pro -
gram leader from 1 (‘Poor’) to 5 (‘Excellent’). The par -
ticipants could also explain their ratings of each of the 
items qualitatively.Table 2 (continued)

Individual sport game ratings
At week 8, the adolescents rated their level of satisfaction 
with each of the 5 sport games using the scale 1 ‘(I did 
not like it’), 2 (‘I liked it a little’), or 3 (‘I liked it a lot’). The 
participants could also explain their ratings of each of the 
items qualitatively if they answered with a rating of 1 (i.e., 
‘I did not like it’).
Guardian acceptability questionnaire
The guardians of the participants completed 6 open-
ended items at week 8. The included items asked (1) 
what they may enroll their child in as an alternative to 
the PYSP , (2) what they thought the main benefit of the 
PYSP was for their child, (3) what aspects we should not 
change, (4) whether they would recommend the PYSP to 
a friend, (5) whether they would enroll their child if the 
PYSP were offered in the future, and (6) suggestions for 
how we could improve future iterations of the PYSP .

tionnaire (TEOSQ; [47] was used to measure goal orien -
tation at baseline. Each item was prefaced by the stem, 
‘I feel most successful in sport when… ’ Task-orientation 
items include examples such as ‘I learn a new skill and it 
makes me want to practice more, ‘while examples of ego-
orientation items include ’I’m the only one who can do 
the play or skill. ’ Each item is rated using a 5-point Likert-
type scale. The reliability of each scale was good  to excel -
lent (i.e., 0.86 for the task scale and 0.85 for the ego scale).
Overall physical activity enjoyment
Enjoyment of physical activity was measured using the 
Short Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (S-PACES; [62], 
developed for children in grades 3–6. The S-PACES consists of 7-items rated using 5-point Likert-type scales. 
Each item begins with the stem, ’When I am active… ’ 
with sample endings including ‘I feel bored’ and ‘I dislike 
it. ’ The reliability of the scale was good  (0.85).
PlayFit Youth Sport Program enjoyment
Enjoyment of the PYSP was measured at week-8 using 
a modified version of the S-PACES. The original stem 
‘When I am active… ’ was replaced with ’When I do Play -
Fit… ’ followed by the endings of the original scale and 
using the same 5-point Likert-type scales. The reliability 
of the scale was excellent (0.97).
Situational needs satisfaction
At week 8, the 12-item Activity Feelings State Scale (AFS; 
[63] was used to measure whether the PYSP satisfied the 
basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and 
relatedness. The participants responded to the stem ’Par -
ticipating in PlayFit made me feel … ’ followed by such 
items as ‘free to decide for myself what to do’ (Autonomy 
scale), ’like my skills are improving’ (Competence scale), 
or ‘involved with close friends’ (Relatedness scale). The 
participants rated each item on a 7-point Likert-type 
scale. The reliability of the scales was questionable to 
good  (i.e., 0.65 for autonomy, 0.88 for competence, and 
0.50 for relatedness).
Accelerometry
Each participant wore ActiGraph (Pensacola, FL) 
wGT3X-BT tri-axial accelerometers around the waist for 
7 days prior to the sport game sessions to measure base -
line physical activity. Intra-session accelerometry data for 
Ultimate Frisbee and Netball were improperly recorded 
and unusable. As recommended by Trost and colleagues 
[64], time spent sedentary and in physical activity was 
determined using the cutoffs proposed by Evenson and 
colleagues (i.e., sedentary ≤ 100, light 101–2295, mod -
erate ≥ 2296, and vigorous intensity ≥ 4012 counts per 
minute; [65]. To reflect the intermittency of the games of 
PlayFit, the accelerometers recorded at 3-s epochs.
Data analysis
Quantitative data
Demographic data are presented as medians and/or 
counts. Because of the small sample size, scores for the 
outcome variables are reported as medians and  ranges, 
total out of total number possible, or percentages of the 
total possible.
Qualitative data
Qualitative data were analyzed by two researchers inde -
pendently using deductive (i.e., top-down) and inductive Table 4 Participant baseline characteristics

(i.e., bottom-up) content analysis to categorize the 
responses into specific themes. Deductive content analy -
sis was used a priori to generate broad themes. Inductive 
analysis was used to allow additional themes not pre -
dicted by the researchers a priori to emerge. Once the 
themes were established, the frequencies for each were 
tabulated.
Results
Objective 1. Recruitment capability and resulting sample 
characteristics
Twelve White adolescents 10 to 12  years of age and in 
grades 5 to 7 enrolled and consented (baseline data are 
illustrated on Table  4). The participants were of mostly 
‘healthy weight’ according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (i.e., between the 5th and 85th 
percentile for their age and sex; [61]). Seven of 12 par -
ticipants reported playing an organized sport in the 
past and 3/7 were doing so currently. One 11-year-old 
male participant was lost to contact following baseline 
measurements (due to reasons not provided), leaving 11 
participants to complete the program (see Fig.  1 for par -
ticipant flowchart).
How many potential eligible members of the targeted 
population are accessible in the local community?
We mailed 5,057  recruitment letters  using  a listing of 
pediatric healthcare  patients. This system allowed us 
to partially prescreen participants by general char -
acteristics, including age, but not by other eligibility 
Fig. 1 Participant flow throughout the intervention
Page 10 of 16 Ladwig et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:118 
requirements (e.g., physical activity level). There was no 
other direct public involvement or patient involvement 
through the College of Medicine, besides accessing pedi -
atric patient databases to mail recruitment letters.
What are the recruitment rates?
Forty guardians responded with interest in enrolling their 
children and 32 continued to correspond to be assessed 
for eligibility. Seventeen were deemed  eligible for the 
study and 5 were lost prior to consent, leaving 12 partici -
pants to consent and enroll in the study.
How feasible and suitable are eligibility criteria?
The eligibility criteria did not appear to be overly restric -
tive or too inclusive. The biggest challenge to recruit -
ment may have been related to COVID-19 restrictions, as 
explained below.
What are the obstacles to recruitment?
The most meaningful obstacle of this study was delays to 
beginning human-subjects research related to COVID-19 
mandates. These delays  forced an abbreviated recruit -
ment schedule to allow the outdoor intervention to 
be held in its entirety prior to the early darkness and 
lower  temperatures of the fall. Therefore, letters were 
mailed between July 19 2021 and August 06 2021 for an 
intervention start date of August 9 2021 and an end date 
of October 10 2021. At the time, approximately 2000–
4000 new COVID-19 cases were reported daily in Penn -
sylvania [66]. Although well-ventilated outdoor settings 
are associated with reduced risk of infection [67, 68], per -
ceptions that participation may have been unsafe could 
have limited recruitment. Other important obstacles 
were that bedtimes, homework, and other evening activi -
ties conflicted with the ability of  children to attend.
How relevant is the intervention to the intended population?
The participants in the study showed need for the inter -
vention, as to qualify, their daily physical activity was 
below the minimum recommendation of 60-min per 
day of MVPA [69]. The median accelerometer-derived 
MVPA of the participants at baseline  was 28.5  min/day 
(range = 4.2–41.1). In addition, the guardians of the par -
ticipants expressed a desire to enroll their child in a physi -
cal activity program that their children would like and 
adhere to.
Are the characteristics of the study participants consistent 
with the range of expected characteristics as informed 
by the research literature?
The characteristics of the participants were mostly 
consistent with what was predicted based on the theo -
retical design of the PYSP . For example, the participants typically had higher scores for task-related compared 
to ego-related goal-orientation  items. Moreover, their 
median physical activity levels at baseline were below 
the eligibility criteria of no more than 60  min/day of 
MVPA.
Objective 2. Evaluation and refinement of data collection 
procedures and outcome measures
How feasible and suitable are the data collection procedures?
There were no issues provided by the adolescents or 
guardians in understanding the questionnaires and data 
collection instruments. Possibly due to attention checks 
(e.g., ’a question was not answered. Would you like to 
answer this item?’), every questionnaire that was started 
was completed.
How feasible and suitable is the amount of data collection?
No participants reported feeling overwhelmed or bur -
dened by the amount of data collection at each time 
point, with most spending fewer than 15 min completing 
the items.
Do the measures appear to be performing in a consistent way 
with the intended population as compared to measurement 
information available in the research literature?
The reliability coefficients of the questionnaires were 
‘good’ to ‘excellent, ’ except for the ‘autonomy’ and ‘relat -
edness’ subscales of the Activity Feelings State Scale. Due 
to the small sample size, outliers could have biased these 
estimates. 
Objective 3. Acceptability and suitability of intervention 
and study procedures
What are the retention and follow‑up rates 
as the participants move through the study and intervention?
Eleven of the 12 (91.6%) participants who consented and 
enrolled at baseline remained in the study at the end of 
the 8-week intervention.
What are the adherence rates to study procedures, 
intervention attendance, and engagement?
The participants attended a median of 12 (range = 6–13) 
of 16 sessions offered. While 24 sessions were originally 
planned, 6 were canceled due to severe weather (e.g., light -
ning and/or heavy rain) and 2 by leader absence. Besides 
cancelations, the most common reasons  for  missed ses -
sions were conflicting commitments such as band prac -
tice, other extracurriculars, interference with bedtimes or 
schoolwork, and/or lack of transportation.
Every assigned questionnaire was completed by 12/12 
enrolled adolescents at baseline and 10/11 at week 8. The 
single adolescent that did not complete every question -
naire at week 8 completed 4/5 questionnaires. Additionally, 
Page 11 of 16
 Ladwig et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:118 
 
12/12 guardians at baseline and 11/11 at week 8 completed 
every questionnaire.
What is the level of safety of the procedures 
in the intervention?
The participants and guardians reported no adverse 
events during or following the intervention.
Objective 4. Resources and ability to manage 
and implement the study and intervention
Does the research team have the administrative capacity, 
expertise, skills, space, and time to conduct the study 
and intervention?
The intervention sessions were delivered by the lead 
author. Recruitment and enrollment activities were car -
ried out by one research project manager and one research 
technologist. The administrative tasks of the current inter -
vention could likely be achieved using fewer personnel.
Can we conduct the study procedures and intervention 
in an ethical manner?
The present study complied with all approved human-
subjects’ protocols as well as federal, state, and University 
COVID-19 pandemic mandates. There were no adverse 
events reported throughout the intervention period by the 
adolescents or their guardians, but adverse advent report -
ing was to be completed by the PYPS leader or reported to 
research project staff.
Can the study and intervention be conducted 
within the designated budget?
The budget for the present study was not precisely esti -
mated prior to the intervention.  However, the intervention 
was delivered below the budget submitted during the fund -
ing application.
Is the technology and equipment sufficient to conduct 
the study and intervention, including collection, 
management, and analysis of data?
REDCap longitudinal data collection software was suf -
ficient to conduct the study and was available through 
contracts with the University. Basic data entry skills and 
training are necessary to input these data accurately. 
Depending on the sample (e.g., access to the inter -
net), paper format instruments are available if the need 
for a non-electronic measurement delivery is deemed 
necessary.
Are we able to efficiently and effectively manage data entry 
and analysis?
REDCap offered the study team members a seamless and 
efficient means to manage data collection.Objective 5. Preliminary evaluation of participant 
responses to intervention
Does examination of quantitative data suggest 
that the intervention is likely to be successful?
The quantitative data suggest that, in its current form, 
the intervention could be a promising approach to pro -
mote activity among sedentary adolescents. Following 
the conclusion of the program, 8/10 participants who 
completed all post-study satisfaction items reported 
that they would recommend the PYSP to one of their 
friends, and their median net promoter score (i.e., likeli -
hood of recommending the program to a friend, out of 
10) was 7 (range = 6–10). Nine of 10 reported looking 
forward to the sessions with a median rating (out of 3) 
of 2.5 (range = 1–3). The median ratings (out of 3) for 
the individual sport games ranged from 3 (range = 2–3) 
for handball and Ultimate frisbee (range = 2–3), to 2 for 
soccer (range = 1–3), Ultimate football (range = 2–3), 
and netball (range = 1  –  3). Finally, 8/10 participants 
responded that they would be interested in continu -
ing the program if it were offered to them in the future. 
Individual counts and proportions for each item are 
included in Table 5 .
In general, scores for overall physical activity enjoy -
ment (median = 23.0, range = 22–35) were lower than 
enjoyment of the PYSP (median = 26.5, range = 21–35). 
However, we were not adequately powered to examine 
these differences statistically.
Among the 3 sport games evaluated for MVPA, the 
proportion of total playing time spent in MVPA was 
between 30–50% and 68–91% for all physical activity 
intensities. That is, despite providing little direct encour -
agement beyond the self-referenced ‘try as hard as you 
can, ’ the proportion of time in MVPA was comparable 
to more traditional sport games (e.g., 48.3% ± 13.9%; [70] 
and practices (e.g., ~ 33%; [71, 72].
Finally, at week 8, 10/11 guardians reported that they 
would consider enrolling their children in the program if 
it were offered in the future.
Do participants or relevant others provide qualitative 
feedback that may be indicative of the likelihood 
that the intervention will be successful?
The qualitative responses provided useful information 
that could be used to improve future versions of the 
PlayFit program. For example, the participants noted 
the characteristics that they liked most about the leader, 
who, based on the ‘positive coaching’ dimension of the 
fun-integration theory, was theorized to play an inte -
gral role in facilitating experiences of fun during pro -
gram sessions. The participants reportedly liked that 
the leader was encouraging, supportive, fair, and tried 
to include everyone (i.e., focused on providing every 
Page 12 of 16 Ladwig et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:118 
player ‘touches’ during games). The responses also sug -
gested that the games of PlayFit were easy to play with 
few skill barriers to entry, were low pressure (i.e., did 
not introduce pressure to score or to perform), provided 
an opportunity to sample a variety of sport games, and 
a chance for socializing with  similar peers. However, 
changes to netball and Ultimate football were suggested. 
For netball, the participants indicated the regulation 
size basketball hoop was too difficult to score on, while 
the foam ball for Ultimate football was easy to catch but 
no easier to throw than a normal football (qualitative 
responses among the adolescent participants are sum -
marized in Table 6 ).
The guardians also provided helpful qualitative feed -
back. Interestingly, several guardians reported not know -
ing what other sport programming would be satisfactory 
for their children, highlighting the unique needs of this 
group. Most reported encouraging their children to par -
ticipate in individual pursuits (e.g., Karate) or walking. 
Some opined that increasing competition and speciali -
zation made it difficult for their child to wish to partici -
pate in youth sport. Many guardians responded that what 
they liked about the program was that their children were 
exercising and socializing with other children, trying a 
multi-activity program, and that it was a non-competitive 
environment with little pressure to perform (qualita -
tive responses from the guardians of the participants are 
summarized in Table 7).Are the findings congruent with the proposed theoretical 
model for the intervention?
The qualitative and quantitative data collected during 
this small-scale feasibility study could offer preliminary 
support for the theoretical model proposed in the design 
section of this manuscript.
Discussion
Strengths
Retention among those who enrolled in the interven -
tion was high (i.e., 91.7%), providing support for its fea -
sibility. Although several sessions were canceled due to 
leader absence or   inclement weather, those that were not 
canceled were delivered in their entirety. The responses, both Table 5 Participant Net Promoter Scores, satisfaction with the

quantitative and qualitative, among the adolescents and their 
guardians suggested that the program required only minimal 
modification to improve the experience of the stakeholders.Challenges
Initial recruitment was hampered by an abbreviated 
timeline and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Many guardians and adolescents may have been fear -
ful of enrolling in a program where close contact would 
occur. Other  activities, such as other extracurriculars, 
homework, and scheduled bedtimes also impacted  
session attendance. Moreover, several sessions were 
canceled due to inclement weather or unexpected leader 
absence, which limited the total sessions available  to the 
participants.
Recommended refinements
Despite the short recruitment timeline, the manner in 
which the study was advertised may have  limited uptake. 
Participants were recruited via physical mail which may 
not have been checked on a regular basis. Although 
the letters appeared to be from the medical provider of 
the child, they could have been misidentified as ’junk’ 
mail and discarded. Though physical mailings may be 
a component of an effective recruitment campaign, in 
the future we could incorporate more “word of mouth” 
approaches to garner interest. For example, a more out -
ward focus on the strengths of the program relative to 
existing sport options for adolescents (e.g., non-compet -
itive/contact, easy to play at any skill level, no pressure 
to perform) may help increase recruitment. In addition, 
social media advertising and video media “commercials” 
demonstrating what a session of the PYSP looks like, in 
practice, may prove attractive.
Some of the responses from the adolescents also sug -
gested advertisement  might be more successful if there 
were more focus on its atypical, unstructured, and non-
competitive design. For example, the 3-s rule did not 
allow players to hold the sport implement (e.g., Frisbee, 
soccer ball) for extended periods. Along with mirroring 
the movement patterns of children and allowing them 
to self-regulate their effort, the intention was to involve 
more players by preventing more skilled players from 
‘hogging the ball’ or running from ‘end-to-end’ to score. 
However, we understand that this could be frustrating for 
more skillful or ego-oriented players.
Based on the observations of the PYSP leader and the 
qualitative responses of the participants, there were a 
few minor adjustments to the sport games of the pro -
gram that may improve the experience. For example, 
the ball used for ultimate Football (a foam football) 
was easy to catch but difficult to throw. In future itera -
tions, the use of a football similar to the Nerf™ Vortex 
(i.e., with a tail for stabilization) may prove easier to 
use for Ultimate football. Moreover, a larger sized net 
may allow for more scoring opportunities  for  lower-
skilled players.Table 7 Guardian responses to program satisfaction qualitative

Limitations
Despite the encouraging results, several important limita -
tions should be considered. First, because this was a form -
ative evaluation of a preliminary version of the PYSP , we 
did not have formal feasibility hypotheses, nor prespecified 
feasibility thresholds or progression criteria. In addition, 
current methodological limitations precluded us from 
empirically evaluating experiences of fun during  sport 
without interrupting gameplay. Therefore, we cannot con -
clude whether  retrospective perceived sport enjoyment 
of the participants was influenced by experiences of fun 
during the PYSP sessions, or other unmeasured variables. 
Future studies utilizing noninvasive, measures of auto -
matic affective (i.e., fun) responses during sport, such as 
facial expressions [73] or other psychobiological responses 
[74], may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying dif -
ferences in perceived enjoyment.
Generalizing these findings is difficult due to the small, 
homogeneous sample and short intervention duration. 
The participants were all White, higher socioeconomic 
status (mean family income = $125,000), and had regular 
transportation to the evening sessions. Children whose 
guardians worked multiple jobs or abnormal schedules 
may not have had similar access. We also conducted this 
study from August to October 2021, during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Adolescents who expressed interest and guard -
ians willing to enroll their children may have been unique 
in that they felt safe with proximity to others in the throes 
of the pandemic. Finally, at this point in the development 
of the PYSP , we did not conduct an economic evaluation.
Conclusions
In its current form,  the PYSP shows signs of promise. 
However, before continuing to an appropriately-powered 
efficacy trial, it should be further refined based on the pre -
sent recommendations. We anticipate that some criticisms 
of the PYSP will center on the contention thatoutcomes 
such as increased fitness, skillfulness, and performance 
should be considered ‘secondary’  relative to maximizing 
repeated experiences of fun during sport. We understand 
this criticism but suggest that improvements in these sec -
ondary outcomes may follow naturally when children dis -
cover a sport (or PA) to which they adhere. That is, to reap 
the benefits of PA, people must adhere to PA.
Moreover, because the PYSP is intended to be an alterna -
tive to typical elite and recreational sport, we do not explic -
itly aim to advance players to the ‘next level. ’ Therefore, 
changes in fitness, skillfulness, and performance matter less 
and participants can self-reference them (if they wish to do 
so, at all). For example, participants in the PYSP may freely 
decide to remain in the program indefinitely, try (or return 
to) an elite or recreational sport, or drop out altogether to 
pursue other, more enjoyable, physical activities. Therefore, in contrast to many athlete-development models, the inten -
tion of PYSP-style programming is to increase the likeli -
hood of lifelong PA among those whose needs are not being 
met by existing sport programs. The PYSP may also help 
rectify one of the common  shortcomings of recreational 
sport programs—specifically that their quality depends on 
the mission of the program as well as the personality types, 
experiences, and expertise of those leading them [38, 40–
42]. That is, children who participate in the PYSP may one 
day become adults who can more easily empathize with, 
and lead, children like themselves as children (i.e., those 
who experienced typical youth sport as not fun). As with 
how many elite and recreational sport participants return 
to coaching  as adults, the PYSP could generate a ‘grass -
roots’ network of future leaders, helping to disseminate the 
program and insure its long-term survival.
