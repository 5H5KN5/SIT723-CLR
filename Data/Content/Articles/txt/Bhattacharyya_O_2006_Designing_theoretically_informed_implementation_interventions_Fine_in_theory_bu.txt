Abstract
The Improved Clinical Effectiveness through Behavioural Research Gr oup (ICEBeRG) authors
assert that a key weakness in implementation research is the unknown applicability of a given
intervention outside its original site and problem, and suggest that use of explicit theory offers an
effective solution. This assertion is problematic fo r three primary reasons. Fi rst, the presence of an
underlying theory does not nece ssarily ease the task of judging the applicability of a piece of
empirical evidence. Second, it is no t clear how to translate theory re liably into intervention design,
which undoubtedly involves the diluting effect  of "common sense." Thirdly, there are many
theories, formal and informal, and it is not clear why any one should be given primacy. To
determine whether explicitly theory-based interven tions are, on average, mo re effective than those
based on implicit theories, pragma tic trials are needed. Until empirical evidence is available showing
the superiority of theory-based in terventions, the use of theory sh ould not be used as a basis for
assessing the value of implementation studies by research funders, ethics committees, editors or
policy decision makers.
Introduction
The Improved Clinical Effectiveness through Behavioural
Research Group (ICEBeRG) authors assert [1,2] that a key
weakness in implementation research is the unknown
applicability of a given intervention outside its original
site and problem. They argue that more widely applicable
interventions (and imply that more effective interven-
tions) should be created by: (1) using explicit behavioral
theories to quantitatively characterize the determinants of
professionals' behavior choices, (2) identifying predictorsthat are common across many settings and problems, and
(3) designing interventions based on the most powerful
predictors. Though this view is logical, it is problematic,
and not based on empirical evidence.
First, the presence of an underlying theory does not 
necessarily ease the task of judging the applicability of a 
piece of empirical evidence

(page number not for citation purposes)to the underlying theory from which grew the empirical
study. Behavioral theory is possibly less predictive of
behavior than physiological theory is of physiology. It is
further diluted in its predictive power by contextual differ-
ences, such as health service design and medical cultural
differences whose effects on choice cannot be directly
translated into the internal psychological forces which are
the subject of behavioral theory. We should also bear in
mind that the physiological theory predicting a cardio-
protective physiological effect for hormone replacement
therapy was so convincing that millions of women were
prescribed it, but in empirical studies it failed to achieve
the predicted benefits, and indeed resulted in substantial
harm [3]. Formal theory may be an unreliable predictor of
outcome even within the theorized group, and thus a poor
framework for extrapolation of outcome to other settings
and subjects.
Secondly, it is not clear how to  translate theory rigidly into 
intervention design
There is no reproducible, algorithmically operationalised
process for taking predictor variables from a quantitative
theory based descriptive study and turning them into ele-
ments of an intervention. Since this process will be diluted
by human judgment, which is influenced by many factors
other than the theory (i.e., knowledge of context and per-
sonal prior beliefs), we believe that theory is contributing
less to this part of the process than it appears. Theory
could be merely a cover for common sense, or a grounded
approach to designing an intervention.
Thirdly, there are many theories, formal and informal, and 
it is not clear why any one should be given primacy
Theories overlap and contradict each other. Even theoreti-
cians are forced to distill from the multitude of testable
formal theories relevant to professional behavior change
a common core of domains; in itself a new, meta-theory,
but because of its reverse engineering, based upon little
more than common sense [4]. Many formal theories and
concepts in the field of psychology had already been
described recognizably using lay terms and ideas, suggest-
ing that these ideas are accessible without theories. We
live in our own psyche, observe ourselves, reflect on our
situation, and ask our colleagues why they make choices.
Others observe our choices, directly, through inquiry or
by analysis of routine data, and speculate on its determi-
nants. Though not particularly rigorous, all these
approaches are plausible sources of informal 'theories.' As
such, they can explain professional behavior and inspire
ideas for the design of interventions to change behavior,
which can then be tested.How could we decide whether formal theory offers the 
best approach for designin g interventions to change 
behavior?
Abstract arguments on this question will continue incon-
clusively [5]. On the one hand, theory development may
lead to a greater meta-understanding and move the field
forward. On the other hand, the phenomena being stud-
ied may be so complex that all this work will not lead to
theories with greater predictive power than implicit theory
or "common sense." The exercise may be so time-consum-
ing (e.g., the 20 to 80 years spent conceptualizing cogni-
tive behavioural theory is Eccles et al.'s example [2]) that
it may not be a particularly efficient way to proceed. We
need an empirical answer to Eccles et al.'s assertion that
"better evaluations of what does and does not work in
implementation research will only be possible with the
explicit use of theoretically informed interventions." We
need to know, in practice, whether interventions to
change professional behavior, designed using formal the-
ory applied in a predefined and reproducible manner, are
more effective at changing the targeted behavior than
alternative, less theory bound approaches. Given a suffi-
cient set of replicates, across a reasonable range of settings
and professional behavior choices, we can reach an empir-
ical answer. One such randomized trial is underway
(TRYME protocol, Francis et al, in submission).
Until there is empirical evidence that interventions
designed using theories are generally superior in impact
on behavior choice to interventions not so designed, the
choice to use or not use formal theory in implementation
research should remain a personal judgment. Research
funders, ethics committees, systematic reviewers, editors,
and policy decision makers should not in any way restrict
this choice.
