(Received 26 October 2011; ﬁnal version received 26 April 2012 )
We describe the development process and completed structure, of a self-help
online intervention for bipolar disorder, known as MoodSwings (www.moods-
wings.net.au). The MoodSwings program was adapted as an Internet intervention
from an eﬃcacious and validated face-to-face, group-based psychosocial
intervention. The adaptation was created by a psychologist, who had previously
been involved with the validation of the face-to-face program, in collaboration
with website designers. The project was conducted under the supervision of a
team of clinician researchers. The website is available at no cost to registered
participants. Self-help modules are accessed sequentially. Other features include a
mood diary and a moderated discussion board. There has been an average of
1,475,135 hits on the site annually (2008 and 2009), with some 7400 unique
visitors each year. A randomised controlled trial based on this program has been
completed. Many people with bipolar disorder are accepting of the Internet as a
source of treatment and, once engaged, show acceptable retention rates. The
Internet appears to be a viable means of delivering psychosocial self-help
strategies.

Background
Bipolar aﬀective disorder is a common chronic disabling condition, with a
population prevalence rate estimated between 1% and 4% (Kessler et al., 2005).
Direct service costs for bipolar disorder in the coming decade were estimated at
AU$400 million per annum, with more indirect costs consequent upon losses in
productivity, carer burden and welfare beneﬁts increasing this ﬁgure by a factor of
four (Access Economics and SANE Australia, 2003).
Medication is the primary treatment approach and can signiﬁcantly improve
outcomes (Malhi et al., 2009). Issues of non-adherence, high rates of relapse even
when treatment adherent and a reduction of functionality between episodes are
challenges to the treatment and management of this disorder (Gitlin, Swendsen,
Heller, & Hammen, 1995; Keck, McElroy, Strakowski, Bourne, & West, 1997).
Ongoing diﬃculties outside of an acute episode have also been noted, with evidence
of impairment across multiple psychosocial domains (Hammen & Cohen, 2004). A
review by MacQueen, Young, and Joﬀe (2001) noted that studies of psychosocial
outcomes consistently found that 30–60% of people with bipolar disorder
experienced compromised psychosocial functioning. These issues of functionality,
adherence and the medication eﬀectiveness–eﬃcacy gap have established a role for
adjunctive psychosocial interventions (Berk et al., 2010; Lauder, Berk, Castle, Dodd,
& Berk, 2010).
There is strong emerging evidence that psychosocial interventions can enhance
medication adherence in bipolar disorder (Colom, Vieta, Martinez-Aran et al.,
2003). Meta-analyses and systematic reviews indicate that adjunctive psychosocial
interventions also have the ability to both prevent and delay relapse (Castle et al.,
2010; Lam, Burbeck, Wright, & Pilling, 2009; Vieta et al., 2009). The eﬃcacy in terms
of relapse goes beyond medication adherence (Colom, Vieta, Reinares et al., 2003)
and may, inter alia, be accounted for by fostering a greater personal understanding
of the disorder, identiﬁcation of prodromes and the development of healthy coping
strategies (Beynon, Soares-Weiser, Woolacott, Duﬀy, & Geddes, 2008; Colom,
Vieta, Reinares et al., 2003). The ability of psychosocial interventions to be eﬀective
in both poles of the illness has been demonstrated by a number of studies (Castle
et al., 2010; Colom et al., 2009). Miklowitz (2008) recent review of adjunctive
psychotherapy also noted a number of positive functional outcomes in terms of
social, occupational and quality of life domains. A range of psychological
approaches have been evaluated using randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs,
including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; Lam, Hayward, Watkins, Wright, &
Sham, 2005; Scott et al., 2006), psychoeducation (Colom et al., 2009), family-focused
therapy (Miklowitz et al., 2000), social rhythm therapy (Frank et al., 2005, 1999),
caregiver interventions (Perlick et al., 2010; Reinares et al., 2008) and interventions
that include multiple elements (Castle et al., 2010).
Although psychosocial interventions can provide treatment beneﬁts, access to
these specialist interventions are limited, due to supply and access constraints. This is
particularly so outside of capital cities, where rural and regional centres are under-
serviced by health professionals (Bamford et al., 1999). In Australia, for example,
91% of psychiatrists’ main practices are based in metropolitan areas, with a similar
pattern for psychologists (Judd & Humphreys, 2001). Wang et al.’s (2005) study of
the use of mental health services in the United States noted that those living in rural
areas and those on low incomes were among those not receiving adequate treatment.2 S. Lauder et al. 156
The use and acceptability of the Internet as a medium for information on a
range of physical and mental health issues is well documented (Fox et al., 2000).
Those with stigmatised illness have also been found to use the Internet signiﬁcantly
more for health information than those with non-stigmatised illness (Berger,
Wagner, & Baker, 2005). Increasingly over the past decade, the Internet has also
been the vehicle for psychosocial interventions (Barak, Hen, Boniel-Nissim, &
Shapira, 2008; Lauder, Chester, & Berk, 2007). Online programs can provide
access to specialist programs either where they may not exist, such as in rural or
remote areas (Ybarra & Eaton, 2005) or where demand exceeds supply (Titov,
2007). Online programs are able to transcend the barrier of stigma, as individuals
are free to seek information in relative privacy (Abbott, Klein, & Ciechomski,
2008).
A number of Internet-based psychosocial interventions have been developed and
validated in the mental health area (Barak et al., 2008).These include interventions
for unipolar depression (Andersson et al., 2005; Mackinnon, Griﬃths, &
Christensen, 2008), panic disorder (Klein, Richards, & Austin, 2006), phobias
(Schneider, Mataix-Cols, Marks, & Bachofen, 2005), post-traumatic stress disorder
(Klein et al., 2010) and eating disorders (Winzelberg et al., 1998). The take-up of
such programs is impressive; for example, the publicly accessible MoodGYM
depression program recorded 17,646 sessions (an indication of visitor numbers) over
a 17-month period (Christensen & Griﬃths, 2002). Overall, results of such studies
support their eﬀectiveness and highlight their potential in enhancing mental health
outcomes (National Institute of Clinical Studies, 2003).
Preliminary research suggests that e-therapy is less expensive than face-to-face,
with similar eﬀect sizes (Klein et al., 2009, 2010; Mihalopoulos et al., 2005). Current
online programs diﬀer in level of support and use of interactive tools. Greater eﬀect
sizes have previously been found in interactive programs, which are typically CBT-
based, in comparison with static sites that tend to use simply a psychoeducation
model (Barak et al., 2008). Interventions also vary from being completely self-guided
to having some level of therapist support. Although therapist-assisted models have
generally been associated with greater eﬀect sizes than self-help models, the meta-
analytic research conducted in this area (Barak et al., 2008; Spek et al., 2007) has
been plagued by methodological limitations such as the use of waitlist controls
confounding any deﬁnitive conclusions.
We are aware of four other online interventions for bipolar disorder. A
psychoeducation-only program (Proudfoot et al., 2007) created interest, with 8000
visitors in its ﬁrst six months, including people with bipolar disorder, service
providers and caregivers. This program is currently being evaluated via an RCT
comparing psychoeducation alone with consumers as online ‘‘informed supporters’’
for those newly diagnosed with bipolar disorder (Proudfoot et al., 2009). Barnes,
Harvey, Mitchell, Smith, and Wilhelm (2007) have evaluated a self-help 21 session
program containing elements of psychoeducation and CBT and comparing it with an
attention control group directed to public websites that focus on healthy living. No
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in time to relapse were found between the intervention and
control groups (Barnes et al., 2007). More recently, a psychoeducation program
developed in the UK is combining both online and face-to-face delivery. The
‘‘beating bipolar’’ intervention combines an initial face-to-face session with eight
fortnightly online modules and a clinician-moderated discussion board. The
intervention is being compared with treatment as usual in an RCT (SimpsonPsychology, Health & Medicine 3157
et al., 2009). Preliminary results of this study failed to separate on the primary
outcome measure (Smith et al., 2011).
The fourth bipolar intervention, and the focus of this paper, is known as
MoodSwings www.moodswings.net.au. MoodSwings is alone as an online adapta-
tion of a face-to-face program, in this case the MAPS program (Castle et al., 2010).
It utilises the content of eﬀective face-to-face group sessions as the core program
modules and follows a similar approach to the post-program booster sessions.
The aims of this paper are to describe the process by which the MoodSwings
website was developed from an eﬃcacious face-to-face program and to describe the
content of the website and key features of the online program.
Method
The MoodSwings website was constructed by adapting a validated face-to-face
group-based psychosocial intervention, the MAPS program for bipolar disorder
(Castle et al., 2010) as an Internet-based intervention. The original face-to-face
intervention administered 12 weekly sessions and 3 follow-up monthly booster
sessions. The multidimensional program included key components of other validated
modalities, psychoeducation and CBT, as well as elements of dialectical behavioural
therapy, social rhythm therapy and motivational interviewing. The MoodSwings
website was constructed by the current authors. These included some of the key
people who designed and validated the original face-to-face program. The team also
included members with expertise in bipolar disorder, as well as previous experience
and expertise in the development of online interventions (e.g. Klein et al., 2006). The
team members regularly communicated through emails and regular telephone and
group meetings. Website content was drafted by one of the authors (SL) and agreed
and ﬁnalised by consensus. The SDH consulting (Melbourne, Australia) was
engaged on a fee for service basis, as experts in web design and online technologies.
Funding was provided by beyondblue: The national depression initiative . This is a
non-proﬁt organisation supported by Australian Federal and State Governments as
well as community donations. Draft versions of the MoodSwings web pages were
circulated among team members in an iterative manner until the team agreed that it
was ready for the site to go live.
Results
MoodSwings program
An outline of the MoodSwings program is shown in Table 1. For pragmatic reasons,
it contains fewer modules than the face-to-face intervention, but covers the same
content areas. The core modules denote the active therapeutic content. Participants
are given access to only those modules that are applicable to their type of bipolar
disorder. Following the recommendation of Andersson et al. (2005), core modules
become available every two weeks, giving participants time to review all the material
in one module before moving on to the next. Previous modules can be accessed for
the duration of the program.
The self-assessment measures provide a hurdle task for entry into the modules
(see Table 2). The booster modules were designed as ‘‘information only’’ to
correspond with follow-up outcome measures, at 3, 6 and 12 months. Module
content was entered into the program via a content management system interface4 S. Lauder et al. 158

Interactive tools
The basic content of MoodSwings employs a psychoeducational approach along
with a limited skills component. In addition, the active intervention group receives
CBT-based interactive elements. These include:
.Mood monitoring , including monitoring of depression, elevated mood, anxiety
and irritability. Journal entries help link triggers and stressors with changes in
mood and are visible on the mood monitor as scroll-overs on any of the data
points. The mood monitor also allows for recording of number of hours slept,
and whether medication has been taken as prescribed. Mood, irritability and
anxiety ratings are also represented graphically.
.Themedication monitor records current medication, along with the identiﬁca-
tion of perceived beneﬁts and side eﬀects.
.A life chart tool helps develop an understanding of the course of the
participant’s mood cycle and identiﬁes past triggers of illness.
.Cognitive strategies are used to develop helpful thinking in both poles of the
illness via monitoring and challenging unhelpful thoughts (Lam et al., 2003).
These speciﬁc tools facilitate awareness of the cognitive changes that occur
when becoming unwell. Strategies include thought monitoring and challenging
and replacing unhelpful thinking patterns.
.Motivational interviewing techniques are used in weighing up goal directed
activities (Miller & Rollnick, 2002). These are operationalised by evaluating
strategies within a cost–beneﬁt framework. This also links to problem solving
and goal setting strategies where applicable. The tool directs participants to
reﬂect on their current strategies in managing stresses and mood changes.
Participants are able to enter their own personal responses.
.A self-reﬂection tool aﬃrms elements of self to diﬀerentiate ‘‘self’’ from
‘‘illness’’. Participants identify pleasant activities that can be included in their
depression relapse plan.
.Problem solving and the setting of small goals is used as a strategy to reduce
stress, set realistic targets and overcome diﬃculties and barriers.
.Participants are able to record their personal triggers of illness and illness
proﬁle – including early warning signs and symptoms typically experienced
during an episode of illness.
.Participants can develop their personalised ‘‘ preventing relapse plan ’’ that
builds on material in the program and can readily be edited by the participant.
The psychosocial tools operationalise the program material and enable participants
personally to apply the strategies utilising the online tools. At its most simplistic
level, these are the forms that involve check boxes and selection of suggested options
that provide the application of the content material in a personalised way. More
sophisticated tools provide instant feedback, such as the mood monitor via its
graphic capabilities. All of these tools have the potential to enhance engagement
(Barak, Klein, & Proudfoot, 2009) and improve program outcomes. All pages can be
printed by the participant and shared with their healthcare service provider.6 S. Lauder et al. 160
Participants are encouraged to engage in the interactive elements of the modules
to whatever level they are comfortable. Participation is encouraged though reminder
emails if a module has not been commenced. The website tracks every individual
page view (along with details of which user is viewing the page and their progress in
the website), allowing the researcher to analyse usage patterns. All research data can
be exported from the website in CSV format, which can be easily imported into
SPSS.
Moderated discussion board
The MoodSwings program includes a moderated asynchronous discussion board for
participants to communicate and share experiences via small groups with others
enrolled in the program. The posts are moderated in that they are reviewed by a
researcher prior to being posted to ensure that no distressing or inappropriate
material is posted onto the board, but there is no active moderator presence on the
board.
Beta testing of MoodSwings
MoodSwings was tested in a small beta-testing study to assess both the functionality
and content of the program. Seventeen participants including healthcare service
providers, postgraduate psychology students and a consumer consultant reviewed
the site. The postgraduate students were used as a mock group and proceeded
through the program in a similar, but accelerated manner to real participants. Issues
identiﬁed were primarily around site navigation and with the usability of the
questionnaires. In particular, a lack of automated direction to missed questions and
the automated email reminders were the most problematic.
A small pilot group ( n¼12) tested the intervention, in a clinical sample.
Participants were recruited by referrals from service providers, and also through
online sources such as general searches and links to the MoodSwings site. The
majority of the pilot sample was female (83.3%) and had a diagnosis of bipolar 1
(75%). The mean age of the pilot was 41.92 (SD ¼11.16). Of the 12 participants, 2
never logged onto the site. The remaining participants spent an average of three hours
on the program (range 20–180 minutes). A number of technical issues related to
usability were found to impact use of the program. Qualitative feedback from
participants included support for the ﬂash object used to illustrate key points, the
usefulness of the online mood monitor and having the educational information
presented in a sequential manner. This allowed the program to be reﬁned and
debugged in an iterative manner.
Discussion
Online interventions have been found to be eﬀective in a range of clinical disorders.
A number of new and innovative online programs as adjunctive treatments in
bipolar disorder are now emerging. Our experience to date with MoodSwings
suggests a high demand for such services: The fact that a high proportion of users
live in rural areas suggests the paucity of face-to-face services for specialist
psychosocial interventions in many such jurisdictions and aﬃrms that online
programs such as MoodSwings can go some way towards bridging this gap.Psychology, Health & Medicine 7161
The feedback from the pilot group has supported the type of program we
have developed, with a clear stepwise ‘‘journey’’, staged knowledge and skills
acquisition, regular assessments and feedback and the online discussion board
which seems to engage people as a virtual group; and in part the nature of
bipolar disorder itself, with an often unmet need for the sort of information on
oﬀer. A future challenge will be to ascertain precisely which elements enhance
retention, and to build on these.
Conclusion
MoodSwings is an online adaptation of the MAPS program, a validated eﬀective
face-to-face intervention for bipolar disorder (Castle et al., 2010). The process of
establishing and evaluating the face-to-face program allowed us to reﬁne the content,
build the eﬀective learning and skills acquisition tools and determine the overall
content and structure of the online version. The site has demonstrated an
encouraging degree of acceptance and may have advantages over traditional face-
to-face therapies due to low costs, high reach and accessibility, impervious to time
and distance and anonymity.
We are currently undertaking a formal evaluation of the outcomes associated
with the use of MoodSwings: These ﬁndings will be reported elsewhere. At this
stage, we believe that we have established a program that meets an unmet
treatment need and which has good engagement and retention of patients with
bipolar disorder.
