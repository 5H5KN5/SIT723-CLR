ABSTRACT
Background: The diet of toddlers is often not in accordance with
dietary recommendations, putting them at risk of poor health
outcomes later in life. Parents can struggle to provide theirtoddler with a healthy diet and interventions are needed. Helping
parents to form healthy feeding habits may facilitate healthy
feeding behaviours. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
establish the feasibility of a 6-week online intervention to build
healthy feeding behaviours in parents of toddlers.Methods: Parents and primary caregivers of children aged 2 –3( N=
75) were recruited to complete a 6-week online intervention
consisting of 6 modules targeting habit formation, planning, goalsetting, self-e ﬃcacy, interpersonal in ﬂuences and picky eating.
Demographics and feeding behaviours were measured with self-
report at baseline and follow-up. Intervention acceptability and
feasibility ratings were also gathered post-intervention.
Results: Most participants were recruited online, highly educated
and in a relationship. After 6-weeks, 17 participants completed
the follow-up questionnaire, 11 of whom indicated that they had
completed the whole intervention. Improvements were found for
some feeding behaviours. Generally, participants who completed
the programme reported that they found it acceptable.Conclusions: This study provides insights for future intervention
development. Firstly, an online healthy feeding intervention
seems to be acceptable but may need to focus on fewer change
techniques. Further, engagement should be improved by
including target group members and compulsory reminders. Thetarget behaviours seem to be relevant. Online recruitment seems
to be preferable and reaches parents and primary caregivers
nationwide.ARTICLE HISTORY

A balanced diet is an integral part of child health as it provides essential nutrients for
growth and development while helping to prevent overweight and obesity. Childhood
overweight and obesity are signi ﬁcant risk factors for poor health outcomes including
a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, psychological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases inlater life (Lifshitz, 2008). Additionally, children with obesity are ﬁve times more likely
to have obesity in adulthood than other children (Simmonds et al., 2016). This suggests
that ensuring a healthy diet in childhood may be protective of health risks in adulthood.Many children in Western society, however, do not meet recommendations for food and
beverage consumption (Demmer et al., 2018; Mihrshahi et al., 2019) and obesity rates
among children in Australia have increased over the past two decades (Australian Insti-tute of Health and Welfare, 2017).
Given that obesity is a serious health risk factor, and that recommendations for
achieving and maintaining a healthy diet are rarely met for young children, interventionstargeting the prevention of obesity and overweight in young children by promoting a
healthy diet are needed. During the ﬁrst years of life, children learn much about food
and eating (Savage et al., 2007). These early experiences with food in ﬂuence later food
preferences (Savage et al., 2007) which supports the need for establishing healthy
eating habits from a young age. Findings also indicate that dietary interventions to
prevent childhood obesity that are initiated earlier in life tend to be more successful
than those initiated later in life (Birch & Ventura, 2009).
However, children ’s eating behaviours are typically in ﬂuenced and controlled by their
parents (Birch & Ventura, 2009; Chesnut et al., 2018). Parents usually select the type and
quantity of food provided to their children and determine the context in which food iseaten (Birch & Ventura, 2009). Additionally, a recent meta-analysis suggests that inter-
ventions focusing on parental feeding behaviour can be useful for changing children ’s
diet (Redsell et al., 2016). Therefore, designing interventions that focus on promoting
healthy feeding behaviour in parents and primary caregivers may allow for earlier inter-vention and more consistency in children ’s dietary behaviours as facilitated by their
caregivers.
Despite the role that parents play in the dietary behaviours of children, comparatively
few studies have explored the e ﬀectiveness of home-based, diet-only interventions
(Wang et al., 2015). Therefore, little is known about the feasibility of those kinds of inter-
ventions. Given that developing and implementing behaviour change interventionsinvolves signi ﬁcantﬁnancial and time commitments it is important to establish the feasi-
bility and acceptability of any intervention prior to further dissemination (Bartholomew
et al., 2001). Considering this, more research is needed that explores the feasibility of
interventions that attempt to foster healthy eating among young children by promoting
the healthy feeding behaviours of parents and primary caregivers.
Theory of planned behaviour
Interventions to change behaviour must identify and then address the determinants ofbehaviour (Kok et al., 2017). To adequately explore the determinants of behaviour it is
important to consider an appropriate theoretical framework, for example, the theoryof planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991) which has previously been used to investigate par-
ental feeding behaviours (McKee et al., 2019). The theory of planned behaviour suggestsHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 1021
that an individual ’s attitudes (overall feeling towards enacting the behaviour), subjective
norm (beliefs about the extent to which others engage in the behaviour and other
people ’s opinions) and perceived behavioural control (perception of control over the
behaviour) predict intention to engage in a behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). An individual ’s
intention to engage in a behaviour, in turn, is proposed to predict actual behaviour. In
addition, a direct association between perceived behavioural control and actual behav-
iour is proposed such that an individual ’s perception of their own level of control over
the behaviour is said to directly in ﬂuence their performance of that behaviour.
However, although many behaviours are planned, it is understood that even if people
have the intention to act in a certain way they may still fail to do so (Sheeran & Webb,2016). Therefore, other factors aside from intention alone are expected to in ﬂuence
behaviour.
Habit
Habitual behaviour is an important aspect of behaviour that is commonly studied in relationto the theory of planned behaviour (Gardner et al., 2014; McKee et al., 2019; Mullan &
Novoradovskaya, 2018). Habitual behaviours form through frequent repetition in a stable
setting (Lally et al., 2010) and once a habit has been formed it is performed without thinking
(de Bruijn & van den Putte, 2009; Gardner et al., 2011;v a n ’t Riet et al., 2011). This makes
habits less likely to be a ﬀected by di ﬀerent intentions, as intentions are reasoned while
habits are performed automatically (de Bruijn & van den Putte, 2009). Therefore, people
often act on their habits even if they do not intend to (Gardner et al., 2020).
Considering this, future interventions targeting healthy feeding behaviours should
potentially consider the impact of habit on parents ’feeding behaviours. In fact, a
recent study that used an extended theory of planned behaviour that incorporated
habit to investigate parental feeding behaviour found that, in combination, intention,
perceived behavioural control and habit strength explained 47% of the variance inparent ’s healthy feeding behaviour (McKee et al., 2019). In comparison, another recent
study that examined parental feeding behaviours using the theory of planned behaviour
alone, found that although attitude, perceived norms and behavioural control predicted58.3% of the variance in parental feeding intentions, intention only predicted 25.2% ofthe variance in children ’s actual fruit and vegetable consumption (Yee et al., 2019).
Although only a few intervention studies have focused on the role of habit for behav-
iour change, there are some habit-based interventions that have had promising results forhabit formation (Mullan & Novoradovskaya, 2018). For example, a systematic review of
habit-based weight loss interventions found that, compared to controls, the interventions
that targeted habit formation resulted in signi ﬁcantly better weight loss outcomes for
participants compared to control groups (Cleo et al., 2020).
A study by McGowan et al. ( 2013) provides further support for the e ﬀectiveness of a
habit-based and parent-focused intervention to promote healthy feeding behaviours forchildren. This intervention was delivered to parents of children aged 2 –6 years in the
United Kingdom and addressed three parental feeding behaviours (providing fruit and
vegetables, healthy snacks or healthy drinks). Habit strength, including automaticity,for all three feeding behaviours was signi ﬁcantly higher for parents in the intervention
group than for parents in the control group. Furthermore, intake of vegetables,1022 L. ENGELS ET AL.
healthy snacks, and water was signi ﬁcantly greater for the intervention group than for the
control group. Despite this success, the intervention was delivered face-to-face making it
costly and reducing the likelihood of up-scaling (Andersson & Titov, 2014). In compari-
son, an online intervention o ﬀers a valuable tool to increase cost-e ﬀectiveness and acces-
sibility (Andersson & Titov, 2014) while being generally as e ﬀective as face-to-face
interventions (Vandelanotte et al., 2016).
Barriers and enablers of healthy feeding behaviour
Given the proposed unique relationship between perceived behavioural control and actual
behaviour (Ajzen, 2002) it is expected that the level of control parents feel they have over
healthy feeding practices is an important element of the translation of intentions to behav-iour. That is, it would be expected that if a parent has a high perception of control over theirability to feed their child a healthier diet, they will be more likely to form the intention to do
so and will ultimately be more likely to engage in the behaviour successfully.
The theory of planned behaviour proposes that perceptions of behavioural control are
inﬂuenced by one ’s beliefs about the barriers and enablers underlying a particular behav-
iour (Ajzen, 1991). For example, previous ﬁndings have shown that picky eating, the con-
sumption of an insu ﬃcient amount or a limited variety of food and/or an unwillingness to
try new food items (food neophobia) (Boquin et al., 2014; Hafstad et al., 2013), is quite
common in children aged 1.5 –4 years and tends to act as a barrier to healthy feeding prac-
tices (Goh & Jacob, 2012; Mascola et al., 2010). If a parent perceives their child ’s picky
eating to be a barrier to their healthy feeding practices, they may have lower perceivedbehavioural control as a result and be less likely to perform the healthy feeding behaviour.
A closely related concept to perceived behavioural control is self-e ﬃcacy. Whereas per-
ceived behavioural control is directly related to control over behaviour, self-e ﬃcacy is
more appropriately described as someone ’s belief about their ability to perform a behav-
iour (Ajzen, 1991). The two concepts are interconnected such that strengthening self-
eﬃcacy regarding a behaviour then increases an individual ’s perceived level of behavioural
control over that behaviour (Ajzen, 2002). In addition to the relationship between per-
ceived behavioural control and self-e ﬃcacy, the level at which someone feels they are
receiving social support has also been shown to in ﬂuence their self-e ﬃcacy (Guan & So,
2016) such that a lack of social support can negatively a ﬀect self-e ﬃcacy.
Furthermore, communication skills and problem-solving skills are strongly related to
self-eﬃcacy (Erozkan, 2013). Therefore, improving an individual ’s communication skills
and problem-solving skills may increase their ability to deal with social con ﬂict through
building their self-e ﬃcacy. Assertiveness is a communication skill that has been shown to
eﬀectively reduce con ﬂict and foster positive relationships (DeVito, 2013). Therefore, by
improving parents ’communication skills, their self- e ﬃcacy and perceived behavioural
control may increase.
Role of time management and planning in feeding behaviour
interventions
In addition to habit strength and perceived behavioural control, previous research has ident-
iﬁed time management and planning skills as additional factors that may in ﬂuenceHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 1023
behaviour and contribute to strengthening the relationship between intentions and behav-
iour (Mullan & Novoradovskaya, 2018; Sniehotta et al., 2005). In a recent study, parents
reported that they found planning to be essential in ensuring a healthy diet for their children(Mullan et al., 2018). However, although studies have repeatedly shown that planning in ﬂu-
ences goal achievement (Adriaanse & Verhoeven, 2018;G o l l w i t z e r , 1999; Gollwitzer &
Sheeran, 2006) parents have also stated that they frequently struggle with planning and
with sticking to their plans, which hinders their ability to perform healthy feeding behaviours(Mullan et al., 2018). In line with this, it has been suggested that simply having strong inten-
tions may not be enough to achieve one ’s goals (Adriaanse & Verhoeven, 2018).
The actual approach to planning is important to consider, for example, coming up
with speci ﬁc action plans formulated in an ‘if-then ’structure, has been found to facilitate
goal achievement and to increase the automaticity of goal-directed responses (Gollwitzer
& Sheeran, 2006; Hagger et al., 2016). Other forms of planning that have also been found
to facilitate goal achievement are coping planning (Pakpour & Sniehotta, 2012; Sniehotta
et al., 2005) and action planning (Adriaanse & Verhoeven, 2018). Coping planning
involves anticipating potential barriers and forming plans on how to overcome themwhile action planning means the preplanning of certain behaviours. Recent researchfound that while intention was a strong predictor of dietary behaviours the relationship
was moderated and mediated by both action and coping planning respectively (Hamilton
et al., 2017). These ﬁndings suggest that both planning and goal setting are important
factors to consider when developing a behaviour change intervention that aims to help
parents ensure a healthy diet for their children.
The current study
The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an online parental
feeding intervention targeting three healthy feeding behaviours which prior research ident-iﬁed as ones which parents often struggle to successfully engage in (Mullan, 2018). Namely,
providing a healthy breakfast, providing healthy drinks (i.e. water and milk), and including
vegetables at dinner. This was done to increase the relevancy of the programme and toallow for the opportunity to explore whether the intervention was more or less successful
for diﬀerent behaviours. However, the programme was not speci ﬁcally designed for par-
ticular behaviours but rather was targeted towards parental feeding behaviour in general.
Assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were the primary objec-
tives. Secondary objectives were to document the characteristics of participants taking
part in this healthy feeding intervention and to explore the potential impact of the inter-vention on parental feeding behaviours. It was expected that the intervention would beacceptable to participants and that participants ’feeding behaviours would become heal-
thier thereby improving their toddlers ’diet.

acceptability of the intervention. Data were obtained by a pre –post design. The pro-
gramme was advertised in two researcher interviews with local radio stations and adver-
tisements on social media networks, supermarket notice boards, and childcare centres.Upon completion of the modules and the follow-up measures, participants couldclaim an AUD 30 shopping voucher as compensation for their time and e ﬀort. After pro-
viding their consent, participants completed a baseline questionnaire and received the
link to the online intervention. Subsequently, participants took part in the six-weekCreating Healthy Eating Environments for Toddlers by Adopting Habits (CHEETAH)
online intervention by following the instructions and completing the modules provided
on the intervention ’s website.
Each week participants were asked to complete a one-hour module. Participants chose
when to do the module and were able to split the modules into subparts as needed. Par-
ticipants were able to choose to receive reminders which were sent out via e-mails once aweek prompting participants to continue through the programme. Upon completion of
the 6-week intervention period, participants were asked to ﬁll in a follow-up question-
naire which duplicated the baseline questionnaire and included additional questionsabout the acceptability of the intervention. Ethical approval was granted by the Univer-sity’s Human Research Ethics Committee (HRE2019-0094).
Participants
Eligible participants were a parent or primary caregiver of a child aged two to three.
Parents and primary caregivers were required to be able to speak and understandEnglish. Participants were ineligible if their child had a chronic disease a ﬀecting their
ability to eat a typical/unrestricted diet. Considering the primary objective of this
study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention prior to a larger trialassessing behaviour change, we aimed to recruit a minimum of 12 participants (Moore
et al., 2011). However, as the intervention was previously untested we anticipated a
large drop-out, especially given the extended time frame and self-directed aspect ofthe intervention. Therefore, we endeavoured to over-sample with the aim to retain at
least 12 participants. As almost all of the ﬁrst 30 participants came from the same Face-
book group an ethics amendment was submitted that would allow for the recruitment ofadditional participants through childcare centres and supermarket notice boards. A total
of 75 participants gave consent to participate in the study, completed the baseline survey
and were provided with a link to the intervention materials. Findings from this feasibilitystudy will be used to inform sample size calculations for any subsequent trials.
Intervention
The intervention consisted of six weekly modules, with interactive and re ﬂective tasks to
build healthy feeding behaviours. Throughout the programme, parents worked on a per-sonalised goal related to one of three behaviours they were asked to select (see Module 1).
Each module focused on one intervention component to help parents and primary care-
givers of toddlers reach their goal. Given ﬁndings from the literature and content of other
interventions this programme focussed on habit formation, planning and goal setting,self-eﬃcacy, social in ﬂuences and support, and habit strengthening.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 1025
Each module included self-re ﬂection tasks whereby participants were provided with
examples and text boxes to serve as prompts and then instructed to think of a particular
situation and to write down their thoughts and re ﬂections. Participants were encouraged
to contact the research team informally to provide them with any feedback.
Content of the six modules
Module 1. Theﬁrst module focussed on providing a foundation for habit formation that
would be built on throughout the remaining modules. Participants ﬁrst received general
information about what habits are, how they develop, and how they may help with ensur-
ing their child engages in healthy eating behaviour. Next, participants were asked toidentify the context in which they usually performed the three feeding behaviours.
After that, participants were asked to choose one of the three behaviours to work on
throughout the programme and to describe how they wished to change the behaviourin concrete terms.
Module 2. This module was centred on action planning and goal setting to help parents
build healthy routines and improve their time management skills. Participants learnt
what makes a good goal and were introduced to the concept of SMART goals (Locke
& Latham, 1990,2002). Participants were then asked to re-frame their chosen healthy
feeding behaviour as a goal, thus building on the content of the prior module. Partici-
pants were also encouraged to use a meal planner and shopping list template throughout
the duration of the programme. Lastly, participants were encouraged to re ﬂect on the
goal they set in Module 1 and to revise/re ﬁne it as needed.
Module 3. In the third module, participants learnt about self-e ﬃcacy and barriers.
Speciﬁcally, participants learnt how to overcome barriers, that may hamper their goal
achievement, and were shown how to use coping planning. They were also guided
through the formation of implementation intentions to facilitate goal achievement.
Finally, participants were asked to take another look at their goal and revise it ifnecessary.
Module 4. The fourth module was concerned with interpersonal in ﬂuences. Speci ﬁcally,
participants learnt how to manage con ﬂict with other adults such as partners, family
members, and friends. Participants were asked to think about one person who supported
their healthy feeding goal and one person that they wanted more support from. Parentswere provided with information on strategies suggested by the Australian government to
address con ﬂict and to increase assertiveness, such as anger management, improving
communication and teamwork, and disclosing one ’s needs (Better Health Channel,
2022).
Module 5. This module was about helping to manage disagreement with one ’s own child.
Participants received tips that could help them take control and to prevent or reduce
conﬂict with their child (Henry & Borzekowski, 2011). They were introduced to some
techniques that could improve picky eating, such as repeated exposure to disliked food(Cooke, 2007; Hetherington et al., 2015; Wardle et al., 2003), and were asked to pick
one of them and specify how they would action it.1026 L. ENGELS ET AL.
Module 6. The last module of the programme provided advice on how to strengthen any
newly formed behaviours and how to e ﬀectively merge them into one ’s daily routine
moving forwards. Participants were introduced to setting graded tasks (i.e. startingwith easy tasks and increase the di ﬃculty until goal behaviour is reached; Kelder et al.,
2015) and provided with a goal template to use in the future.
Data collection
Baseline measures
Demographics
Participants provided details on their age, their child ’s age, the number of children they
had, their educational background, employment status and relationship status.
Parental body mass index (BMI)
Participants provided their height and weight from which parental BMI was calculated.
Previous research has found it to be associated with child ’s health behaviours and weight
(Lee et al., 2019).
Index of relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage (IRSAD)
To determine which decile of the IRSAD participants fell into they were asked to providetheir postcodes. The IRSAD provides information about the economic and social con-ditions of people living within certain areas (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018).
IRSAD deciles range from 1 to 10 with higher values indicating a relative lack of disad-
vantage and greater advantage (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018).
Feeding behaviours
To measure feeding behaviours participants were asked to indicate, using a timelinefollow-back method (Sobell & Sobell, 1992), how many servings of drinks and vegetables
their child had and what their child had eaten for breakfast for a period of three days.
Participants were asked to pick three recent days, with at least one day on theweekend to account for di ﬀerences depending on the day of the week, and were asked
to indicate whether any special events took place on the days. The healthiness of the
items provided was rated on a 5-point Likert scale based on the Australian Health Star
Rating (Commonwealth of Australia, 2019). For the healthiness of breakfast, the
health star rating for each item was added and divided by the total number of items,
mean scores were calculated with higher scores indicating a healthier breakfast. Mean
scores for the provision of healthy drinks and servings of vegetables were also calculated.
Follow-up measures
Primary outcomes: engagement, adherence and acceptability
Acceptability and feasibility questions were based on previous studies examining theacceptability and feasibility of food-related online interventions (Kothe & Mullan,2012; Sainsbury et al., 2015).HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 1027
To determine the level of engagement they had with the programme content partici-
pants were asked which modules they had completed and how much time they spent
using the website. Participants were categorised as having completed the programmewhen they indicated that they completed at least 5 out of the 6 modules of theintervention.
Adherence was operationalised as the amount of time that participants reported
having spent attempting to apply what they learnt using the programme.
Measures of acceptability of the intervention included attrition and ratings of pro-
gramme content. Attrition was calculated as the percentage of individuals who provided
consent to take part but did not complete the ﬁnal survey. Participants rated, using
sliding scales from 1 to 100 (1 = ‘Not at all ’, 100 = ‘Very ’), whether the programme
content was: annoying; interesting; credible; logical; easy to understand; personally rel-
evant; confusing; comprehensive; too long and/or useful.
Secondary outcomes: parental
To measure feeding behaviours post-intervention participants were asked to ﬁll in the
questionnaire using the timeline follow-back method (described above) again. Any
changes in parental feeding behaviours were used to assess the likelihood of harm result-
ing from participation in the programme.
Analysis
Initially, it was planned to use dependent samples t-tests for di ﬀerences between those
who participated in the follow-up questionnaire and either completed 5 or more
modules of the programme (completers) or completed less than 5 modules of the pro-gramme (non-completers) related to acceptability and feasibility ratings and independent
samples t-tests for investigating participants ’behaviour scores pre-and post-intervention.
However, given the small sample size due to dropout, this analysis was not possible.Instead, the outcomes were assessed as described below.
Primary outcomes: engagement, adherence and acceptability
Two primary outcome variables were compared between completers and non-comple-
ters. Engagement level, de ﬁned as time spent on the website and adherence to the inter-
vention, in the form of time spent applying what was learned.
Acceptability of the intervention was assessed comparative to the attrition rate
reported by Sainsbury et al. ( 2013) in their 6-week, online, TPB dietary behaviour inter-
vention. Namely, an attrition rate of ≤50% would be interpreted as indicating that the
intervention was acceptable to participants. Additionally, ratings of intervention
content were categorised as endorsing or refuting the characteristic if the medianrating was above 70 or below 30 respectively.
Secondary outcomes: parental feeding behaviours
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine the behaviour scores for breakfast,
drink and vegetables pre- and post-intervention. Any di ﬀerences in behaviour scores,1028 L. ENGELS ET AL.
irrespective of statistical signi ﬁcance, should indicate that there are no negative changes
pre- and post-intervention that may indicate a risk of harm as a result of participation in
the intervention.
Results
Participants
Seventy- ﬁve parents of children aged 2 –3 gave informed consent and received a link to
the programmes website. Out of the 75 participants that signed up 28 chose to receive
weekly reminders to continue participation. Table 1 outlines the characteristics of the
study participants at baseline and follow-up.
Primary outcomes: engagement, adherence and acceptability
All participants who completed the baseline questionnaire received an invitation to com-
plete the follow-up questionnaire regardless of whether they had completed the interven-
tion or not. Fifteen out of 75 participants at baseline completed the follow-up
questionnaire (20.0%), however an additional 2 participants started the questionnairebut did not complete the outcome measures and have not been included in reportingof the reporting of the primary outcomes. Of the 15 who completed the follow-up ques-
tionnaire, 11 indicated they had completed at least 5 out of 6 modules and were therefore
categorised as ‘Completers ’of the programme while the remaining 4 who completed less
than 5 modules were catagorised as non-completers of the programme. Thus, the result-
ing attrition rate from the study was 85%.
Table 2 provides an overview of the scores for each acceptability measure, as well as
engagement and adherence. The medians of completers and non-completers indicate
that the content was rated as interesting, credible, logical, easy to understand, relevant,
comprehensive, and useful. Conversely, the content was rated as neither annoying norconfusing. Di ﬀerences between completers and non-completers indicate that non-com-
pleters more often rated the intervention as being ‘too long ’compared to completers.
Trends indicate that completers rated the content as less annoying, more interesting,
credible, logical, easier to understand, more relevant, less confusing, more comprehen-sive, and more useful than non-completers.
In regard to engagement and adherence, completers reported that they spent less time
on the website than non-completers but more time attempting to apply the knowledgethey gained from the programme.
Secondary outcomes: parental feeding behaviours
Due to the small sample size there was insu ﬃcient statistical power to adequately assess
the impact of the intervention on parental feeding behaviours. Instead, changes in par-
ental feeding behaviours were used to assess whether or not participation in the pro-
gramme was likely to result in harm.
Table 3 outlines the behaviour scores pre- and post-intervention for the 11 partici-
pants who completed the intervention. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests indicated thatHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 1029
participants had signi ﬁcantly improved scores for serving vegetables on the Timeline
follow-back (z = −2.251, p< .024) with a large e ﬀect size (r = .48). The scores for
drinks and breakfast on the Timeline follow-back did not change signi ﬁcantly (z =
−1.293, p< .196; z = −.561, p< .575). E ﬀect sizes were medium for drinks (r = .28) and
small for breakfast (r = .12). As improvements or no signi ﬁcant changes were detected,
participation in the programme is considered to be unlikely to cause signi ﬁcant harm
in regard to the target behaviours.Table 1. Characteristics of participants at baseline and follow-up and those who dropped out.

Discussion
The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention
to promote healthy feeding behaviours in parents and primary caregivers of toddlers. The
ﬁndings provided insights into how to further develop and adjust the intervention to
improve ﬁt for future participants and increase engagement.
Primary outcomes: engagement, adherence and acceptability
Participants who completed the follow-up questionnaire and completed the intervention
found the intervention was acceptable and feasible. The majority of the participants,
however, did not complete the intervention or the follow-up questionnaire. Thedropout rate was high with parents either dropping out immediately or after ﬁnishing
theﬁrst two to three modules. Despite this being a common problem with online inter-
ventions, which often have dropout rates as high as 84% (Reinwand et al., 2015), the high
drop-out rate for this study suggests that changes to the intervention are needed to make
it more feasible and acceptable to a larger cohort.
A possible explanation for the high drop-out rate could be that non-completers rated
the programme as being too long. In line with this, most dropout was after 2 –3 weeks.
Thisﬁnding is supported by post-survey data of non-completers indicating that they
found the intervention too repetitive and long. Overall, this is problematic as 2 –3
weeks is not enough time to form habits. For habits to form, participants must engageregularly and su ﬃciently long with the intervention content and practice the behaviour
in their daily routine (Gardner et al., 2011). Additionally, the intervention may have been
too broadly focused and may have bene ﬁtted from exploring fewer techniques toTable 2. Engagement, adherence and acceptability ratings.

facilitate behaviour change. In future research, participants could be randomised to
diﬀerent conditions and encouraged to utilise one speci ﬁc technique with results com-
pared between groups. This may reduce participant burden and heighten engagement.
Another reason for the high dropout might be related to participants forgetting to
engage with the intervention. Although this study included weekly reminders, receiving
them was optional and most participants did not sign up to receive them (N = 47). Due to
the modular nature of the intervention participants were required to engage weekly andwithout reminders, they may have forgotten to keep up the intervention. This is in line
with prior research suggesting that receiving reminders is important for engagement with
online interventions (Milward et al., 2018).
Secondary outcomes: parental feeding behaviour and participants ’
characteristics
Although participants were directed to choose a behaviour to focus on throughout the
modules, they still received information regarding all three behaviours therefore therewas the potential for them to change their behaviour in regard to all three. The
ﬁndings suggest that improvements were made in serving vegetables at dinner while
serving healthy drinks and providing a healthy breakfast did not show any relevantchanges. This may be because participants might have chosen to work on serving veg-
etables, instead of the other two target behaviours. In addition, the behavioural
measure showed that the healthiness of drinks and breakfast provided by the participantswas already very high, which could explain the lack of improvement (i.e. ceiling e ﬀect).
To determine whether choice of behaviour impacted the e ﬃcacy of the intervention
future research should ensure the participants choice of behaviour was recorded.
The characteristics of the participants indicate that the intervention was most interest-
ing for parents/primary caregivers in their thirties ( M= 33.8, SD4.4) in a relationship
(97.5%) with 1 –2 children (86.7%) living in urban areas (73.3%). Furthermore, most par-
ticipants had at least an undergraduate degree or TAFE certi ﬁcate (92.0%), indicating
that most participants had a high education level. Additionally, the average BMI
among participants was 27.6, which implies that participants, on average, were over-
weight. However, calculation of parental BMI relied on participant ’s providing estimates
of their height and current weight which are both commonly inaccurate resulting in
lower BMIs (Gorber et al., 2007). Participants ’characteristics also showed that most par-
ticipants were recruited through online advertisements. Moreover, the programme wasable to reach participants nationwide, with 37% from a state other than Western Austra-lia despite the programme being mainly advertised in Western Australia.
Strengths, limitations and future directions
A strength of this study was to clearly document the intervention and associated content.
To adequately determine the e ﬀectiveness of an intervention it is necessary to clearly
identify the behavioural determinants that the intervention is attempting to a ﬀect
change upon. By clearly outlining the design and aims of this research we were able tobe transparent about how we hoped to create change. Additionally, by conducting a com-prehensive feasibility analysis we have gathered extensive evidence for the acceptability of1032 L. ENGELS ET AL.
this type of intervention. We have also provided clear directions for any further develop-
ment or adaption of the intervention below.
The learnings from this study include some potential changes to the intervention that
may help to increase engagement. Although previous research by Mullan ( 2018) was used
to inform the choice of target behaviours, there was limited further consultation with the
target population for this research. To tailor the programme as best as possible to partici-
pants ’needs, more members of the target group should be involved in the future. Having
more target group members involved might also allow for the detection of potential
issues or improvements in the development stage (Eldredge et al., 2016).
An additional limitation that should be considered is that information about com-
pletion of the modules and time spent on the website was only available via self-report
for those who completed the follow-up survey. Instead, the website could be designed
to collect data on access to the website and time spent on each section to gain furtherinsight into module completion and engagement. Additionally, drop-out could be pin-
pointed to speci ﬁc modules and this could provide further direction for improvement.
It is necessary to provide this kind of detail to allow for feasibility and acceptability tobe tracked throughout di ﬀerent aspects of online interventions and to allow for compari-
son between studies. Although it was decided to conduct the intervention online to
ensure the cost was as low as possible, we did not conduct an analysis of the costs of
the intervention. Future studies should record this data to ensure that interventionsare not only e ﬀective but also economically viable.
Additionally, as this was a feasibility study the number of participants was lower that
would be needed to provide an in-depth comparison between those who completed andthose who did not complete the intervention. Lastly, prior research (Milward et al.,
2018) suggests that reminders may be important to keep participants involved in the
intervention. Unlike the current study, receiving reminders should be compulsory infuture interventions to increase engagement with the intervention and to lower thedropout rate.
Conclusion
Overall, this study established that an intervention aimed at promoting healthy feeding
behaviours in parents and primary caregivers of toddlers that was acceptable for the par-
ticipants who completed the intervention. However, acceptability and feasibility overall
were limited by the high drop-out rates. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that the inter-vention is feasible in its current format. The main focus of future intervention develop-
ment should be to increase engagement with online interventions. As supported by our
ﬁndings, potential avenues to increase engagement may include having a group of poten-
tial participants involved in the intervention development (Eldredge et al., 2016) and
including compulsory reminders (Milward et al., 2018). Furthermore, targeting fewer
change techniques may additionally increase feasibility. The three target behaviours,especially serving vegetables, seem to be relevant and improvable. Lastly, future online
intervention should focus on advertising online as it seems to be more successful than
traditional methods and reaches potential participants nationwide. Despite the limitedsuccess of the intervention, this study provides important insights that cannot only beused to further develop and improve the current.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND B EHAVIORAL MEDICINE 1033
