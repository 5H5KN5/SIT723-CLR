Abstract
Background: While a number of preventive intervention s delivered within schools have shown
both short-term and long-term impact in epidemio logically based randomized field trials, programs
are not often sustained with high-quality implemen tation over time. This  study was designed to
support two purposes. The first purpose was to te st the effectiveness of a universal classroom-
based intervention, the Whole Da y First Grade Program (WD), aimed at two early antecedents to
drug abuse and other problem behaviors, name ly, aggressive, disruptive behavior and poor
academic achievement. The second  purpose--the focus of this pape r--was to examine the utility of
a multilevel structure to support high levels of implementation during th e effectiveness trial, to
sustain WD practices acro ss additional years, and to train ad ditional teachers in WD practices.
Methods: The WD intervention integrated three compon ents, each previously  tested separately:
classroom behavior management; instruction, specifically reading; and family-classroom
partnerships around behavior and learning. Teac hers and students in 12 schools were randomly
assigned to receive either the WD  intervention or the standard first-grade program of the school
system (SC). Three consecutive cohorts of first graders were randomized within schools to WD
or SC classrooms and followed through the end of  third grade to test the effectiveness of the WD
intervention. Teacher practices were assessed over three years to examine the utility of the
multilevel structure to support sustainability and scaling-up.
Discussion: The design employed in this trial appears to  have considerable utility to provide data
on WD effectiveness and to inform  the field with regard to structu res required to move evidence-
based programs into practice.

The educational sector, as a normative setting for children,
is an important delivery system for drug abuse prevention.A number of preventive interventions directed at aggres-sive, disruptive behavior and other antecedent risk factorssuch as poor achievement have shown both short-termand long-term impact in epidemiologically-based rand-
omized field trials. However, prevention programs are
often not implemented with high quality in schools [1-3].Until recently, the primary concern of preventionresearchers has been to test the impact of interventionsthrough efficacy and effectiveness trials. The result is thatmany interventions have been tested without precise spec-
ification of the model of support necessary to implement
and sustain intervention practices with high quality overtime.
In fall 2003, we began the third randomized field trial car-
ried out by the senior members of this research team incollaboration with the Baltimore City Public School Sys-
tem. This trial focused on testing interventions aimed at
aggressive, disruptive behavior and poor achievement,separately and in combination. Results of the first two tri-als [4-15] provided support for undertaking this trial inwhich we combined three intervention components--classroom-behavior management; academic instruction,
particularly in reading; and family-classroom partner-
ships--into one integrated intervention called the WholeDay First Grade Program (WD). This trial was designed tobring together effectiveness and implementation research.The design supported an effectiveness trial of the WDcompared with the standard school district program (SC).
The design also supported an examination of the utility of
a multilevel structure to support high levels of implemen-tation during the effectiveness trial, to sustain WD prac-tices across additional years, and to train additionalteachers in WD practices. This paper presents the imple-mentation portion of the protocol in which we followed
teachers with subsequent cohorts of children to study sus-
tainability and scaling-up. Also see Additional File 1:'Description of WD intervention, student sample, andmeasures of student outcomes' and Additional File 2: 'WDcohort two student sample figure'.
Specific aims and hypotheses
The specific aim and hypotheses regarding implementa-tion (aim three) follow logically from the aims of theeffectiveness trial (aims one and two).
Aim one
Model the malleability of developmental paths by evalu-
ating the effectiveness of the WD program, directed at
reducing the antecedent risk factors for later substanceabuse, comorbid mental and behavioral disorders, andschool failure. We hypothesize that students in WD class-rooms will exhibit less aggressive, disruptive behavior,
more on-task behavior, and gains in student achievement,
particularly in reading, compared with their counterpartsin SC classrooms over the course of first grade and to theend of third grade.
Aim two
Measure the variation in the impact of WD by examiningmoderating factors at the level of the child and the socialcontexts of family, classroom and school, peers, and com-munity. In line with the results from our previous trials,we hypothesize that: the impact of WD will be strongeramong children who begin first grade with lower readi-
ness and poorer student behavior than their classmates;
and the impact of WD will vary as a function of the qualityof teacher practices, with improved teacher practices lead-ing to student improvements in behavior and achieve-ment, proximally and through third grade.
Aim three
Examine the utility of the support structure: during theeffectiveness trial; as teachers implement WD in consecu-tive cohorts of first graders (sustainability); and as WDpractices are taught by school system employees to teach-ers new to WD (scaling-up). We hypothesize that: themultilevel support structure will result in sustained high
levels of WD practices with three consecutive cohorts of
first graders; and the multilevel support structure willresult in high levels of WD practices with additional teach-ers when they are trained in WD practices.
Methods
Overview of the design
The within-school design involved 12 public elementaryschools and two first-grade classrooms within eachschool. Within each school, three consecutive cohorts ofchildren were randomly assigned to first-grade classroomsas they enrolled. Classrooms/teachers were randomized
to intervention condition in the first year, with one
teacher assigned to WD and one teacher assigned to SC.Because every school had a WD and a SC classroom,schools served as blocking factors, and comparison ofintervention effects could be obtained for each school.This two-level randomized block design allowed us tohold school, family, and community catchment area fac-
tors fixed while examining intervention effects at the class-
room level, and examine main effects and testhypothesized variations in impact on the basis of varia-bles such as gender, students' individual aggressive behav-ior, teacher self-efficacy, and classroom levels of aggressivebehavior. Random assignment of children to classrooms
allowed two classrooms within a school to be comparable
at baseline and was extremely efficient in testing the maineffect of a classroom intervention [5,6,16,17].

(page number not for citation purposes)Aware of the possibility of intervention leakage with this
classroom-based, within-school design, we implemented
procedures that had successfully limited such leakage inthe prior trials, such as meeting with principals monthly[16]. In addition, the SC teachers received training andsupport in WD as part of the design in the third year of thetrial. We found no evidence of contamination in the
schools with internal controls in either of the first two tri-
als [5,16] or in this trial.
Procedures for random assignment
We drew upon our prior experience as well as knowledgein the field to develop protocols for the random assign-
ment of both students and teachers. Here, we describe the
procedures for random assignment in this multilevel trial.For details regarding the effectiveness arm of the trial inwhich we followed students over first grade and into thirdgrade, see Additional File 1: 'Description of WD interven-tion, student sample, and measures of student outcomes'and Additional File 2: 'WD cohort two student sample fig-
ure'.
Schools
We began with a pool of 66 elementary schools in two
adminstrative areas of the school district. Schools wereexcluded if all the students attending the school received
special education or other special services; the school was
operated by an entity other than the school system; thefirst-grade curriculum was not the standard district curric-ulum; or the school had fewer than two or more than fivefirst-grade classrooms. We excluded large schools becausethey were less common and tended to have different
organizational structures than smaller schools. Twenty-six
of the 66 schools were excluded as a result of these criteria.Because academic achievement was a primary target of theWD intervention, we decided that the schools performingless well academically would be eligible to be part of theWD initiative. The 40 schools remaining after the first
exclusion step were ranked by third-grade academic
achievement on the standardized achievement test usedby the school system, third grade being the lowest grade atwhich a standardized achievement test was used to ratestudent achievement. In October 2002, principals of the20 lowest performing schools participated in a lotterydraw to randomly assign schools to participate either as
one of eight schools deemed development schools, where
we piloted intervention components and conducted stafftraining on assessment procedures, or as one of 12schools deemed trial schools, where the randomized fieldtrial would take place (see Figure 1). The trial was con-ducted in these 12 schools for three consecutive school
years beginning in 2003 to 2004.Classrooms/teachers
In April 2003, all 37 first-grade classrooms/teachers in the
12 schools participating in the randomized field trial wererandomly assigned to condition. In each school, oneteacher was randomly assigned to be a WD classroom/teacher, one was randomly assigned to be a wait-listed SCclassroom/teacher, and all other first-grade teachers were
randomly assigned to be nonparticipating classrooms/
teachers. Teachers in both WD and SC classrooms werefollowed as they taught three consecutive cohorts of firstgraders. In a type of wait-listed control, SC teachers whoserved as controls for cohorts one and two were trained inthe third year to deliver WD to cohort three first-grade stu-
dents. The effectiveness trial relied on efficient within-
school comparisons of WD and SC for cohort one andcohort two students from first to third grade. The sustain-ability question centered on whether WD teachers' prac-tices remained high or fell off across the three cohorts. Thescale-up question centered on whether the practices of theformer SC teachers improved--as well as the consequent
child outcomes--when they were trained to deliver WD.
While each of the 12 schools maintained the design by
having one WD classroom and one SC classroom eachyear for three years, there were changes at the teacher levelas teachers left the school. We anticipated that some
teachers would change over the years, and we established
a protocol for such changes. We stipulated that if a teacherleft, the classroom would not change condition and thenew teacher would be assigned the departing teacher'sintervention status. If the replacement was a teacheralready in the school, our protocol stipulated that this
teacher could not have previously been assigned to a con-
dition (WD or SC) within the trial. The patterns of teachermobility are shown in Figure 1. There were no changes ineither WD or SC teachers in schools one to five; the sameteachers taught the WD and SC classrooms for all threeyears of the trial. Schools six to 12 experienced some
degree of teacher mobility.
Overall, the changes were typical of staffing in large urban
school districts and a reality when conducting research inreal-world settings. For example, in schools seven andeight, the original SC teacher stopped teaching during thefirst year of the study and a long-term substitute taught for
the remainder of the year. In the second year of the study,
these classrooms were assigned a permanent teacher whotaught first grade in both the second and third years of thestudy. Of note is the fact that in the second year, school sixhad two SC classrooms. After the initial assignment of stu-dents to classrooms, the school decided to add a third
first-grade classroom because enrollment was greater than
anticipated. Because we did not have an established pro-tocol for the situation, we worked with the school todetermine appropriate actions to maintain the random

(page number not for citation purposes)design. We randomly selected 10 students to come out of
the original WD and SC classrooms before the interven-
tion began, creating a new control classroom. The teacher
of this newly formed classroom did not have experienceteaching first grade and was not trained in the school sys-tem's first-grade curriculum, so the original SC class andthe new control classroom were combined in a team-teaching model. By the end of the year, these two classes
had separated back into two traditional, discrete classes.
We decided to collect data in all three classrooms at eachtime point throughout the year. As a result, we have oneWD classroom and two SC classrooms for school six in thesecond year of the trial. In the third year, school six hadonly two first-grade classrooms and they were taught bythe initially assigned WD and SC teachers. In spite of this
unexpected design modification, we were able to main-
tain random assignment of children.
Although there were no instances of protocols being bro-
ken--no teachers changed their design--it is important tonote that SC teachers were replaced at twice the rate over
the three years of the study (n = 8) compared with WD
teachers (n = 4). We have hypothesized that as teachersgain mastery in their classroom with regard to their prac-tices in classroom behavior management and instruc-tional content, they will be less likely to leave a school or
the teaching profession. In keeping with this hypothesis,
we would expect to see a lower rate of attrition in WD
classrooms than in SC classrooms. As we move to an anal-ysis of the data, we will test for systematic bias at the levelof the classroom and at the school/community level.
Structure to support sustainability and scale-up
In developing the support structure required for teachersto learn, implement, and sustain WD practices and foradditional teachers to be trained, we focused on threeareas: understanding the multilevel organizational struc-ture of the school system; delivering professional develop-ment to teachers; and systematically monitoring teacherpractices and support to teachers.
Multilevel structure of the school system
To understand the level and nature of the mandate,authority, accountability, and resources necessary to sus-tain and scale-up WD practices, we needed to understandthe multilevel organizational structure of the school sys-
tem. Figure 2 presents the organizational structure at the
time of the WD trial. The Board of School Commissioners(the school board) had the legal authority to oversee alloperations of the school district. The chief executiveWD Teachers Over Three YearsFigure 1

(page number not for citation purposes)officer (CEO) of the school district (the superintendent)
oversaw all aspects of school district administration. The
chief academic officer (CAO) served under the CEO andwas responsible for all K through 12 instruction, academicas well as behavior and social emotional learning. Underthe direction of the CAO, the city schools were dividedinto four elementary areas, a middle school area, and a
high school area, each overseen by an area academic
officer (AAO). AAOs were responsible for providing sup-port to principals as well as to the schools more generally.Each area office had at least one coach who workeddirectly with schools to provide professional develop-ment. Within the school building, teachers were sup-
ported by the principal, school-based instructional
coaches, and support staff such as social workers and psy-chologists.
We worked with the school system to create two teams to
support the effectiveness trial and the goal of sustainingand scaling-up practices in the school system--the Core
Team and the Schools Committee. The Core Team com-
prised individuals who held key positions of authority inthe school system, along with senior members of theAmerican Institutes for Research (AIR team). Districtmembers included the CAO, senior staff from the officesof curriculum and instruction and professional develop-
ment, and the area superintendents whose schools were
participating in the trial. The Core Team was responsiblefor the implementation and continued monitoring of therandomized field trial within the school district, and metmonthly to review progress against benchmarks and toanticipate and resolve problems. The Core Team's role
was also to address the challenges that often impede the
uptake of interventions into general practice, includingthe time to deliver the intervention, the ease of implemen-tation, the compatibility of the intervention with the mis-sion and vision of the institution, and the cost of theintervention [1-3,18-29].
Principals of the 12 participating schools, along with Core
Team members and senior AIR staff, participated on theSchools Committee. The committee met monthly toaddress issues pertinent to the field trial, such as maintain-ing fidelity, developing procedures for randomization ofteachers/classrooms and students, engaging with parents
and garnering consent, determining ways to introduce the
field trial to the school community, maintaining themorale of standard classroom (comparison) teachers, andmaking decisions at the school level regarding oversight,monitoring, and allocation of resources.

(page number not for citation purposes)Professional development to teachers
As part of the WD trial, we addressed the primary concern
of school system leaders with regard to professional devel-opment for teachers, namely, that the role of the WD facil-itator be specified with precision so that practices wouldbe observable and replicable. Because we were interestedin building capacity within the school system, we decided
that AIR staff would not train teachers directly but would
train school district employees to be WD facilitators whowould work directly with teachers. This model was decid-edly in contrast to the prior two field trials in whichresearch staff worked directly with classroom teachers.
In developing the model of coaching and support to
teachers, we were informed by the emerging literature onprofessional development for educators and on adultlearning. This work highlights the importance of provid-ing opportunities for active learning through observation,meaningful discussion, practice, and reflection [30-32].Research also suggests that professional development is
best conceptualized as an ongoing process rather than a
single event, and that professional development activitiesshould be aligned with one's professional work [30,33-35] and incorporated into one's daily professional work[30,36-38].
Literature on adult learning and school reform empha-
sizes the importance of collective participation of teacherswithin schools, grouped by grade level, or of principalsacross schools [39-42]. A concept that became critical toour coaching model and our work with the Schools Com-mittee and the Core Team is that supporting change at the
organizational level requires linkages across levels in the
system, not just within levels in the system [43,44]. Statedanother way, while professional community matters atspecific levels such as schools [45], it is critical to createcommunities of learners within and across the various lev-els of the organization [46,47]. As defined by Resnick and
Glennan, nested learning communities are 'organizations
in which all individuals and units are expected to upgradetheir capacities continuously in accord with a shared set ofinstructional principles and strategies. In this design,instructional leadership, coupled with reciprocal account-ability between 'layers' of the organization, provide pro-fessional learning opportunities specifically geared to the
district's vision of instruction' [46].
The support provided to the teacher was primarily techni-
cal in that the WD facilitator was considered the expert inWD implementation practices and served as a mentor tothe teacher. WD facilitators had expertise in the theory
and practice of WD and classroom behavior management
more broadly as well as the interpretation and use of dataregarding teacher practices and student behavior. WDfacilitators spent one day per week in the classroom witheach teacher and supported teachers in bringing together
the new knowledge of WD learned in the pre-implemen-
tation training with their craft knowledge of classroomteaching [48]. The WD facilitators spent most of their timeworking directly with teachers in classrooms, observing,planning, modeling and mentoring, and providing feed-back [48,49].
Observations of teacher practices in the classroom pro-
vided the foundation of the WD facilitators' work. Thefacilitators used the WD implementation checklist eachmonth throughout the entire school year to determine thetype, amount, and focus of professional development.
The checklist provided information regarding the occur-
rence and quality of teacher practices on both generalpractices and specific core elements of each component ofWD. Using these data, the WD facilitators prioritizedcoaching needs and worked with the teacher to create aprofessional development plan that specified goals, targetareas for mentoring, and coaching strategies and activities
to be undertaken. WD facilitators supported teachers in
WD practices through modeling of practices, guided prac-tice, visits to other classrooms to observe WD implemen-tation, conferences, and joint planning. The ability towork through trust with the teacher was a critical skill forfacilitators; not all teachers welcomed a facilitator into
their classroom or were open to the support the facilitator
offered [50,51].
The extant literature provided little guidance about the
pace and focus of coaching over the course of a year. Wedecided on a predetermined amount of coaching support,
with WD facilitators spending additional time with teach-
ers who needed more support. Each facilitator supportedfour schools, devoting one day per week supporting theWD teacher in each school. WD facilitators were trainedduring the first year of the trial by intervention team mem-bers who were part of the research staff.
Systematic monitoring of intervention practices and 
support
In recent years, researchers have recognized that the deliv-
ery of intervention practices is usually variable and thatthis variability affects outcomes [1,16,52-59]. To under-stand the occurrence and quality of WD practices and the
support delivered directly to teachers, we measured teach-
ers' practices with regard to WD implementation as dis-cussed above; facilitators' practices in supporting teachers;and the availability of resources such as materials, plan-ning time, and release time for professional development,particularly those provided by the principal.
Measures and data collection
Classroom observations of student behavior and teacherpractices were conducted three times in first grade: base-
Implementation Science  2009, 4:56 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/56
Page 7 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)line/autumn, mid-year/January, and spring/May. Each
observation took four hours over two days, and did not
disrupt the classroom activities. Teacher interviews aboutstudent behavior were conducted with first-grade teachersat the same three time points. When each cohort reachedthird grade, its current teacher was interviewed. In fall andspring of first grade and spring of third grade, students
were assessed individually in a quiet area of the school on
reading and reading-related skills; students were alsoasked about experiencing symptoms of depression andanxiety; see Additional File 1: 'Description of WD inter-vention, student sample, and measures of student out-comes'. School records were collected at the end of each
school year.
Measures of teachers' practices
We conducted classroom observations using a variation of
teacher observation/student engagement [60]. In thistime-sampling schema, a teacher's instructional practiceand students' behavior are recorded minute by minute.
For a teacher's instructional practice, observers code the
instructional format and content of teaching. Eightinstruction categories range from whole class to smallgroups to students working on their own, and include acategory for non-reading instruction. Twenty contentcodes cover four domains: reading comprehension, word
work, oral language and writing, and non-reading-related
activities. The content codes were extended to includefeedback in response to behavior (corrective, praise, puni-tive, directive). Inter-rater reliabilities of >0.80 are main-tained. At the end of each timed observation, observersuse the checklist of teacher's practices to rate the instruc-
tional and behavior management strategies exhibited dur-
ing the session. The form parallels the WDimplementation checklist and provides an independentmeasure of program implementation in WD classrooms,as well as information on classroom behavior manage-ment and instructional strategies in SC classrooms. Items
were added to the teacher interview to assess the strategies
that teachers used to engage with families and the level ofcaregiver response to the strategies.
Measures of fidelity
The WD implementation checklist provided informationabout teacher practices along two dimensions, practices
that were general to the classroom and practices that were
intervention-specific. Thirty-six behavioral indicators pre-cisely defining the core elements of the three interventioncomponents were rated on whether defined practicesoccurred (yes/no) and with what quality (scale of one tosix). A global rating was also given for each of the three
intervention components. Measures of family-classroom
partnership included attendance sheets for activities towhich parents were invited, such as classroom orienta-tion, class meetings, and the family read-alouds. The useof the home-link telephone line, a messaging system for
teachers and parents, was monitored. Checklists were
developed to rate the degree to which principals and facil-itators fulfilled their clearly defined roles related to sup-porting the teacher and the implementation of the WDprogram.
Statistical analyses and power
The analyses for Aim three, sustainability and scaling-upof WD practices, proceed logically from the analyses sup-porting the effectiveness trial of WD.
Analyses for Aim one: Malleability of developmental paths
We are carrying out formal growth analyses to evaluatehow WD affects the course of reading skills and achieve-ment, aggressive behavior, and depressive symptoms.Intervention effects will be modeled as both mean differ-ences in latent growth trajectories for the slope and differ-ences in the covariance between intercept and slope byintervention group, a type of intervention by baseline
interaction [61]. These analyses will include school- and
classroom-level clustering. Following this series of multi-level analyses for single repeated measures, we will con-duct multilevel growth analyses for first-grade throughthird-grade outcomes [62] to test for both main effectsand interactions involving the intervention with baseline
characteristics.
Analyses for Aim two: Variation in impact
We will also examine whether the intervention affects
children differently by using baseline measures of readingskills and aggressive behavior, as well as parent involve-
ment. We have found that additive models [11,15],
because they include nonparametric models with smoothchanges in impact as a function of baseline, are excellenttools to distinguish the degree of benefit that differentchildren receive from this particular intervention. A sec-ond method for examining variation in impact is examin-
ing how baseline interacts with intervention condition to
affect growth trajectories [61,63-65]. These intervention-by-baseline models extend the univariate models into thegrowth curve framework, and allow changes in slope to beaffected simultaneously by both intervention and base-line. Thus we will examine whether the best growth trajec-tory improvement from the intervention occurs more for
higher- or lower-risk children.
A further set of analyses will be based on growth mixture
modeling (GMM) [15,64,66] using Mplus software [62].GMM allows fitting multiple growth trajectories, forexample, early and late starters for aggression, and testing
whether the intervention affects these groups differently.
We can also carry out growth mixture analyses with a cat-egorical distal outcome as well as time-to-event, or sur-vival, measures (such as time of first suspension). In these
Implementation Science  2009, 4:56 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/56
Page 8 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)general growth mixture models (GGMM) [15,64], param-
eters of individual growth trajectories, including inter-
cepts, slopes, and higher-order shape parameters, may beinfluenced by baseline characteristics, intervention status,and time-dependent covariates. GGMM also allows indi-viduals to follow a class of growth trajectories. An impor-tant part of this model is that class membership is an
unobserved category variable. Nevertheless, like latent
class analyses, GGMM permits both predictors andresponses to be related to the unobserved class member-ship. Model selection for GGMM will be based on boththe bootstrap likelihood ratio test and the Bayesian Infor-mation Criterion [67] with examination of model fit
[64,68,69].
Analyses for Aim three: Sustainability and scaling-up of 
WD practices
We will examine the extent to which the impact of WD on
children's learning and behavior is explained by the levelof by the teacher implementation, as well as school-level
support, over time. We have successfully examined such
implementation measures in the past [16] when we deter-mined that poor implementation of the intervention fullyexplained the lack of improvement in some schools. Sus-tainability will be tested by comparing the practices andsubsequent child outcomes for the WD teachers over two
as well as three years with those of their SC counterparts
for the first two years. Scaling-up will be tested by compar-ing the practices and child developmental outcomes forthe original SC teachers in their last year with those in pre-vious years and with those of WD teachers. The differencein SC measures across cohorts assesses this extendibility,
and the power is expected to be similar to that for testing
the intervention in cohort one because here each teacherserves as his or her own control.
Statistical power
In cohort one, we expect to have power of 0.79 to test the
WD main effect on end-of-first-grade reading when the
true effect size is 0.25, compared against total variation inthe sample. This calculation is based on specification ofmultivariate means, variances, and covariances from datafrom prior trials conducted in Baltimore. The prior studiesprovide estimates of each source of variation as well (chil-dren, classrooms within schools, and schools) [70]. It
assumes that individual variation is twice as large as
school variation, that classroom variation at the time ofrandomization was negligible, and that the variation inintervention impact by school is a third of the overall var-iation, with effect size. Because this earlier trial involved asmaller number of schools (nine instead of 12 schools)
and a less comprehensive intervention compared with
that in the present trial, we anticipate having higher statis-tical power than in the previous trial. In that trial, we wereable to report significant main effects and interactions[10,16]. The power is nearly identical for third-grade main
effect analyses as it is for end-of-first-grade analyses, even
when we allow for 20% attrition, primarily from mobility.This loss in power through attrition is generally more thanoffset by the increase in power from growth curve analysis[61].
For testing whether the intervention improved teacher
practices, statistical power is slightly higher, for the samesize effect, compared with analyses of child outcomes.This difference occurs because the teacher measures arenot subject to the added statistical error arising from childvariation. Thus, we expect to have sufficient power to
detect moderate size effects in this trial on teacher prac-
tices across cohorts. Our hypotheses state that the WDeffects on the original WD teachers should increase fromcohort one to cohorts two and three. We plan to test thiswith a two-level linear trend model across cohorts. A testfor nonlinear trend (one DF) can also be carried out. Thetrend tests are expected to have higher power than our
original tests of sustainability because there should be
stronger improvements of these teachers over the cohorts.
Discussion
The WD trial was deliberately designed to bring togetherresearch on program effectiveness with research on pro-
gram implementation. Although the model of support to
teachers was not experimentally manipulated, we arelearning a great deal about the multilevel structure thatneeds to be in place to ensure that teachers can learn,implement, and sustain evidence-based intervention prac-tices with high quality over time and that support prac-
tices being scaled-up. This information will inform the
next generation of interventions focused on enhancingprogram implementation.
Ethical review
Ethical approval for this trial was obtained by the Institu-
tional Review Board at the American Institutes for
Research on July 17, 2002.
