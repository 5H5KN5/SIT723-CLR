Objective: Low-cost (e.g., computer-tailored) interventions with sustained effects are needed to
increase and maintain physical activity in older adults. This study examined the long-term efficacyof 2 computer-tailored physical activity interventions for older adults and its psychosocial andenvironmental mediators. Methods: A clustered randomized controlled trial ( N/H110051,971) was
conducted that included 3 research arms: (a) basic computer-tailored print intervention, targetingpsychosocial mediators; (b) environmentally computer-tailored print intervention, targeting psycho-social and environmental mediators; and (c) no-intervention control group. Interventions weredeveloped using the intervention mapping approach and consisted of 3 computer-tailored lettersdelivered over 4 months. Questionnaires assessed the study outcomes (i.e., total weekly days andtotal weekly minutes of physical activity) at baseline and 12 months. Potential mediators (i.e.,awareness, attitude, self-efficacy, intention, social influence, intrinsic motivation, self-regulation,and perceived environment) were assessed at baseline and at 3 or 6 months. Results: Multilevel
regression analyses revealed that both interventions significantly changed total weekly days ofphysical activity compared with the control group, but only the environmentally computer-tailoredprint intervention significantly changed weekly minutes of physical activity. Multiple mediationmodels showed that the effects of both interventions on weekly days of physical activity weremediated by changes in awareness and intention. Conclusions: Computer-tailored interventions
were effective in inducing long-term behavioral changes in physical activity behavior of olderadults. Awareness and intention were found to be important mediators of changing daily physicalactivity and should be included in future computer-tailored intervention studies.

The high prevalence of inactivity in older adults worldwide
requires immediate action to stimulate regular physical activity(PA) in this age group (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, 2005). Physical inactivity , defined as not meeting the inter-
national recommendation of 30 min of moderate PA a day on atleast 5 days of the week (Physical Activity Guidelines AdvisoryCommittee, 2008), increases the risks of health problems (Depart-
ment of Health, 2004). Therefore, important health benefits can beachieved with low-cost (e.g., computer-tailored) interventions pro-moting PA in older adults that demonstrate sustained effects.
Research has shown that PA behavior of older adults can be
effectively changed through PA interventions (Conn, Minor,Burks, Rantz, & Pomeroy, 2003; King, Rejeski, & Buchner, 1998;Van der Bij, Laurant, & Wensing, 2002). Computer-tailored inter-ventions, in which computer technology facilitates the broad im-
plementation and fine-tuning of program materials to the individ-ual characteristics and interests (De Vries & Brug, 1999; Kreuter,Farrell, Olevitch, & Brennan, 2000), is a low-cost strategy that hasthe potential to reach a large population. Computer-tailoring hasshown promising effects in different health promotion programs(Kroeze, Werkman, & Brug, 2006; Noar, Benac, & Harris, 2007)and in PA promotion in older adults (Jancey et al., 2008; King etal., 2007; Walker et al., 2009). However, evidence on long-termeffects of computer-tailored PA interventions for older adults isstill lacking. In addition, most PA interventions have focusedsolely on intervention effects and failed to analyze the workingmechanisms of the intervention (i.e., mediators). Analyzing medi-

ators of intervention effects can evaluate whether the intervention
is working as expected (Mackinnon, 2008) and can prompt futureintervention developers to add effective intervention componentsand remove ineffective strategies, resulting in more cost-efficacious interventions (Hafeman & Schwartz, 2009).
In one study, two computer-tailored PA interventions targeted at
the adults over 50 years of age were developed (van Stralen et al.,2008). Both interventions consisted of personalized feedback let-ters for changing PA behavior by targeting potential psychosocialmediators. One such intervention (the intervention-plus condition)additionally targeted potential environmental mediators by provid-ing tailored environmental feedback (e.g., presenting detailed in-formation about PA possibilities at home and in the neighborhoodand providing access to a website including a forum and e-buddysystem). In the short term, both interventions were effective inchanging PA behavior compared with the control conditions, withmedium effect sizes (ESs) at 6 months ES
Ibasic/H110050.30 and
ESIplus/H110050.35 (van Stralen, De Vries, Mudde, Bolman, & Lech -
ner, 2009a, 2009b). No differences in intervention effects on totalPA behavior between the two interventions were found at 6months.
The aim of the current study was twofold. First, we aimed to
examine the long-term efficacy of two computer-tailored printinterventions (one including and one excluding environmentalinformation) aimed at promoting PA in older adults. We hypoth-esized that the interventions would be effective in changing PAover 12 months compared with the control condition. Second, weaimed to examine the mediated effects of changes in potentialpsychosocial and environmental mediators on changes in PA be-havior over 12 months. As both interventions targeted all under-lying psychosocial mediators, we hypothesized that changes inthese concepts would mediate changes in PA. We further hypoth-esized that the working mechanisms of the two interventionswould differ. Because only the intervention with environmentalinformation was developed to change underlying environmentalmediators, we expected that the mediated effect of social andphysical environment factors (i.e., perceived environment, socialinfluence) would be more explicit in the environmental interven-tion.
Method
The study was registered at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR920)
and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of MaastrichtUniversity and the University Hospital Maastricht.
Participants and Procedure
The procedure of the study, including the selection and enroll-
ment of participants and the distribution of the questionnaires andinterventions, is shown in Figure 1. Participants were eligible toparticipate when they were 50 years of age or older, were citizensof one of the selected municipalities, and when their generalpractitioner did not advise against participating in PA behavior. Aclustered randomized controlled trial was conducted that includedthree research arms: (a) basic computer-tailored print intervention ,
a motivational focused computer-tailored intervention targetingpotential psychosocial mediators; (b) intervention plus , a motiva-
tionally and environmentally computer-tailored print interventiontargeting potential environmental mediators in addition to the
motivational focused computer-tailored feedback of the basic in-tervention; or (3) waitlist control , receiving no intervention. In
2007, all Dutch Regional Municipal Health Councils (MHCs; N/H11005
39) were invited to participate in the program. Nine MHCs agreedto participate, after which six MHCs were randomly assigned toone of the three research arms. Randomization was stratified byurbanization level. Per MHC, depending on the size of the invitedmunicipalities, one or two municipalities were invited to partici-pate, resulting in two municipalities per research condition. Onlymunicipalities with a minimum of 20,000 inhabitants and who didnot (plan to) participate in another Dutch PA promotion programwere eligible for participation. All invited municipalities werewilling to participate. In total, a random sample of 8,500 adults 50years of age and over was selected and invited to participate so asto include 2,000 participants. Based on a significance level of .05and a power of .90, the minimum sample size for each researchcondition at 12 months should be 450 subjects to detect a relativeincrease of 5% in PA behavior. Given that 30% of dropout isexpected between baseline and 12 months, 2,000 participants needto be included at baseline. Participants were invited to participateby an invitation letter, signed by the project leader and a repre-sentative of the MHC or municipality (e.g., mayor), accompaniedby a baseline questionnaire and informed consent form.

to win city trips or gift vouchers. Baseline measurement lastedfrom March to June 2007.
Intervention and Design
The content of the computer-tailored interventions has been
described in more detail elsewhere (van Stralen et al., 2008) but isbriefly described below. The intervention programs were devel-oped according to the intervention mapping protocol (van Stralenet al., 2008), which is a six-step protocol that facilitates a stepwiseprocess for theory- and evidence-based development of healthpromotion interventions: (1) conduct a needs assessment and de-fine program objectives, (2) define performance objectives andcreate matrices of change objectives, (3) select theory-based inter-vention methods and practical strategies, (4) produce programcomponents and materials, (5) plan a program adoption and im-plementation, and (6) plan a process and effect evaluation.
The intervention development was based on the theoretical under-
pinned assumption that an intervention effect can be achieved bychanging certain underlying mediators. The selection of mediatorswas based on a Delphi study (van Stralen, Lechner, Mudde, De Vries,& Bolman, 2010) and a literature review on determinants of PAbehavior change in older adults (van Stralen, Lechner, Mudde, Bol-man, & De Vries, 2009). Theoretical methods and practical strategieswere selected on the basis of focus groups with the target group (vanStralen et al., 2008) and theoretical models such as the I-Changemodel (De Vries, Mesters, Van ’t Riet, Willems, & Reubsaet, 2006),the social cognitive model (Bandura, 1986), the transtheoreticalmodel (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983), the health action processapproach (Schwarzer, 2009), the precaution adoption process model(Weinstein, 1988), self-regulation theory (Baumeister & Vohs, 2004),and self-determination theory (Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2007). Sup-plemental material files 1a and 1b (available online) show the poten-tial mediators, theoretical methods, theories related to the theoreticalmethods, practical strategies, and tools used in the interventions.Because computer-tailored print interventions were found to be moreeffective in changing PA maintenance than telephone-tailored inter-ventions (Marcus et al., 2007), especially in older adults (Castro,King, & Brassington, 2001), we developed two computer-tailoredprint interventions.
Basic computer-tailored intervention participants ( n/H11005654) re-
ceived three computer-tailored letters with personalized PA advice.The first and second tailored letters were based on personal datagathered at baseline and were sent 2 weeks and 2 months afterbaseline, respectively. The third letter was sent 2 weeks after receiv-ing the 3-month questionnaire and was based on the data gathered atbaseline and 3 months; it addressed any changes each adult hadundertaken during these 3 months. By targeting potential mediatorsthat underlie each specific phase of behavior change, the interventiontried to influence awareness of own PA level (e.g., by targetingpsychosocial mediators such as knowledge and awareness), initiationof PA (e.g., by targeting psychosocial mediators such as attitude,social influence, action planning), and maintenance of PA (e.g., bytargeting psychosocial mediators such as coping planning and com-mitment). The letters comprised between the three and 11 pagesdepending on (changes in) PA level and mediator scores.
Intervention-plus participants ( n/H11005737) received the same
motivationally focused computer-tailored information as the basicintervention participants but additionally received environmentally
focused computer-tailored information about PA opportunities intheir neighborhood combined with access to a forum and e-buddysystem on a website. The tailored environmental information in-cluded handouts with walking and cycling routes in their ownneighborhoods, examples of exercises to do at home, contactinformation of neighborhood sports clubs that matched their inter-ests and abilities, and a map of their close neighborhood on whichwalking and cycling possibilities were highlighted (see Supple-mental file 1b, available online). This tailored environmental in-formation was gathered via GIS, municipality and regional guides,walking and cycling guides of the Dutch transport association, andthe Internet.
Waitlist control participants ( n/H11005586) received nothing during
the intervention period. They did receive one computer-tailoredletter, which was a combination of the three computer-tailoredletters from the basic computer-tailored print intervention, aftercompletion of the research period.
Data Collection
All participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire at baseline,
3, 6, and 12 months assessing demographics, the potential medi-ators, and the outcome variables.
Demographics. At baseline, weight, height, age, gender,
highest completed educational level, employment status, and hav-ing a partner were assessed using a questionnaire. Educationallevel was categorized into low, middle, and high, according to theDutch educational system. Body mass index (BMI) was calculatedfrom weight and height.
Mediators. At baseline, all potential mediators were mea-
sured. Based on the content of the intervention, we measureddifferent potential mediators at different posttests. For example, ifthe potential mediator was targeted in the first two letters of theintervention (e.g., attitude and self-efficacy), the potential media-tor was measured at the 3-month posttest. If the interventiontargeted the potential mediator (also) in the third letter (e.g.,awareness, intention, self-regulation concepts), the potential me-diator was also measured at the 6-month posttest. As a result, at the3-month posttest, awareness, attitude, social influences (i.e., socialsupport, social modeling, and having a sports partner), intrinsicmotivation, and self-efficacy were assessed. At the 6-month post-test, awareness, intention, perceived environment, commitment,strategic planning, action planning, and coping planning weremeasured. Because awareness was targeted in all three letters andadditional changes were expected after the 3-month posttest, wedecided to measure awareness also at 6 months. Awareness wasclassified by combining self-rated PA level with compliance withthe PA norm. Compliance with the PA norm (yes/no) was derivedfrom the total weekly days of PA measure. Based on the combi-nation of the two measures, we then divided the participants intoparticipants unaware of their personal PA level, including overes-timators (do not comply with PA norm but rate their PA as [highly]sufficient) and underestimators (do comply with PA norm but ratetheir PA as [highly] insufficient), scored as 0; and participantsaware of their personal PA level, including high realists (docomply with PA norm and rate their PA as [highly] sufficient) andlow realists (do not comply with PA norm and rate their PA as444 VAN STRALEN, DE VRIES, MUDDE, BOLMAN, AND LECHNER

[highly] insufficient), scored as 1 (Lechner, Bolman, & Van Dijke,
2006). Table 1 shows answering options and Cronbach’s alphas.
Outcome variables. The primary outcome measures were
total weekly days of PA and total weekly minutes of PA, assessedwith the self-administrated Dutch Short Questionnaire to AsessHealth-Enhancing PA (SQUASH) at baseline and 12 months. Theoverall reliability ( r
Spearman /H11005.57) and relative validity of the
SQUASH in relation to actigraph activity monitors ( rSpearman /H11005
.67) were reasonable in older patients (Wagenmakers et al., 2008).
Weekly days of PA was measured using a single item question,“On how many days per week are you, in total, moderatelyphysically active, such as heavy walking, cycling, chores, garden-ing, sports or other physical activities for at least 30 minutes?”Weekly minutes of PA was measured using the frequency (howmany days per week) and duration (how many hours and minutesper day) of leisure and transport walking, leisure and transportcycling, sports including both organized exercises (e.g., gymnas-tics) and activities done on one’s own (e.g., running), gardening,and doing odd jobs. For each activity category, examples wereprovided.Statistical Analyses
One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to
test for baseline differences in participant characteristics amongthe three conditions. Logistic regression analyses were conductedto examine whether dropout was associated with baseline charac-teristics. Analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (Ver-sion 15.0).
Participants were nested in neighborhoods within their munici-
pality using the probability of interdependence between them. Toaccount for this interdependence, we completed multilevel linearregression analyses with a random intercept for two levels (neigh-borhood [2], individual [1]) to analyze the efficacy and mediationeffects using MLWin (Version 2.02). The research condition vari-able was recoded into two dummy variables (control group asreference). Assumptions of regression analyses were tested (nor-mal distribution of outcome variables, nonzero variance, multicol-linearity, homoscedasticity, independent errors, and normally dis-tributed errors). Because the outcome variables were not normallydistributed, we used normally distributed residual change scores ofthe outcome variables and potential mediators. Residual change

scores represent the amount of change in the variable independent
of its baseline value and can be calculated by regressing thefollow-up values of the variable onto their baseline values. Resid-ual change scores are preferred above absolute change scores. Thisis because, if possible baseline differences are not taken intoaccount, groups with lower levels are more likely to increase theirlevels by chance alone than groups with higher levels (Twisk,2003). To analyze intervention effects ( c
Ibasic andcIplus), the re -
sidual PA change scores were regressed onto the two interventiondummies and covariates and confounders (i.e., age, BMI, gender,educational level, having physical limitations, and marital status).Covariates and confounders were selected on the basis of theirassociation with PA or their confounding influence on the inter-vention effect as found in earlier analyses (van Stralen, De Vries,Mudde, Bolman, & Lechner, 2010). For improved interpretationand comparison, we calculated Cohen’s ESs by dividing the dif-ference between two means at follow-up by the pooled baselinestandard deviation (Cohen, 1988).
Mediation Analyses
Given that the interventions targeted multiple mediators simul-
taneously, we conducted multiple mediator models informed bythe product-of-coefficients test (Mackinnon, 2008) to be able toevaluate the independent contribution of each mediator. First, theintervention effects on the theoretical mediators were calculated ( a
path). Second, the effects of the theoretical mediators on theoutcome were calculated when controlling for the research condi-tion ( bpath). Third, by multiplying the aandbvalues to provide
abcoefficients, we estimated the specific/individual-mediated ef-
fects ( a
1–15b1–15), the total mediated effect ( /H20858a1–15b1–15), and the
proportion mediation to the total intervention effect ( /H20858a1–15b1–15/
(c/H11032/H11001/H20858 a1–15b1–15)). The total intervention effect is the sum of the
total mediated/indirect effect ( /H20858a1–15b1–15) and the direct interven -
tion effect when accounted for the total mediated effect ( c/H11032). The
statistical significance of the mediated effect is estimated by di-viding the abcoefficients by their standard error. The standard
error of the specific mediated effect was calculated with the Sobeltest ( SEab/H11005/H20844 (a
2*SEb2/H11001b2*SEa2), whereas the standard
error of the total mediated effect was calculated with the multi-
variate delta method /H20844(a12*SEb12/H11001b12*SEa12/H11001a22*
SEb22/H11001b22*SEa22/H11001.../H110012*a1a2COV b1b2; Bollen, 1987).
All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat
principle (Hollis & Campbell, 1999).
Missing Data
Logistic regression analyses, using SPSS (Version 15.0), were
conducted to examine whether the drop-out rate was associatedwith baseline characteristics of the participants (i.e., age, gender,BMI, marital status, employment status, education level, baselinePA level, and research condition). Participants who did not have apartner (odds ratio [OR] /H110051.32, 95% CI [1.16, 1.51]) or partici-
pants who were randomly assigned to one of the interventionconditions (OR
Ibasic/H110052.09, 95% CI [1.81, 2.40]; ORIplus/H110052.48,
95% CI [2.17, 2.83]) were more likely to drop out at 12 months.
Subsequent analyses were corrected for marital status. With regardto the selectiveness on research condition, Carpenter, Kenward,and White (2007) stated that no objection for further analyses canbe raised when dropout is missing at random. Dropout is missing
at random when within each research condition the data are miss-ing completely at random. Subsequent analyses found no signifi-cant predictors of dropout within each research condition, raisingless concern that the selectiveness on research condition under-mined the results.
Missing values were not imputed. In a study examining ways to
handle missing data, it was found that multilevel analysis is veryflexible in handling missing data, leaving no need to impute thedata. Moreover, applying multilevel analyses to an incomplete dataset gave more accurate estimations than applying imputation meth-ods (Twisk, 2003; Twisk & de Vente, 2002). Data were thereforeanalyzed using the incomplete data set including missing data(total data analyses).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
In total, 1,971 older adults (response rate 23%) completed the
baseline questionnaire. The selection and enrollment trends ofparticipants are shown in Figure 1. At 12 months, 1,348 completedthe questionnaire (T3 /H1100568% retention rate). Participants were on
average 64 years old ( SD/H110058.6) and had an average BMI of 25.5
(SD/H110053.8), 81% had a partner, 48% had a low level of education
(primary, lower vocational, preparatory vocational, or mediumgeneral secondary school), and 47% were employed. Significantbaseline differences were found for the level of education, inwhich significantly fewer participants in the intervention-plus con-dition had a low level of education (42%) compared with the basiccomputer-tailored print intervention (51%) and control conditions(50%), F(2, 1928) /H110055.0,p/H11021.01. Baseline and posttest scores of
the total PA behaviors and mediators are shown in Table 2.
Intervention Effects on PA Behavior (c path)
As shown in Table 2, at 12 months, participants in the basic
computer-tailored print intervention condition and intervention-
plus condition had increased their total weekly days of sufficientPA from 4.3 ( SD/H110052.2) to 4.7 ( SD/H110052.0) days per week.
Participants in the control condition had increased their totalweekly days of PA from 4.0 ( SD/H110052.2) to 4.3 ( SD/H110052.0) days per
week. Significant intervention effects for both the basic computer-tailored print intervention condition ( c
Ibasic/H110050.39, SE/H110050.12,
p/H11021.01) and intervention-plus condition ( cIplus/H110050.28, SE/H110050.12,
p/H11021.01) were found when compared with the control condition,
with small effect sizes (ESIbasic/H110050.18, ESIplus/H110050.18). No
significant differences were found between the two intervention
conditions in total weekly days of PA (results not shown). Regard-ing the other PA outcome variable, only the intervention-pluscondition was effective in significantly changing total minutes ofPA per week. On average, participants in the intervention-pluscondition increased their weekly PA behavior by more than 1 hrper week (ES
Iplus/H110050.19, cIplus/H11005/H1100561.8, SE/H1100527.8) compared
with the control condition. No significant intervention effect of the
basic intervention condition was found on weekly minutes of PAwhen compared with the control condition.446 VAN STRALEN, DE VRIES, MUDDE, BOLMAN, AND LECHNER

Intervention Effects on Mediators ( apath)
The first step of the mediation analysis was to estimate the effect
of the interventions on changes in the potential mediators ( apath).
The final two columns of Table 2 show the intervention effects oneach mediator for the intervention basic ( a
Ibasic) and intervention-
plus ( aIplus) conditions, respectively, compared with the control
group. The basic computer-tailored print intervention increased the
participants’ perception of social modeling ( aIbasic/H110050.20, SE/H11005
0.08, p/H11021.05) and self-efficacy ( aIbasic/H110050.08, SE/H110050.04, p/H11021
.05) over 3 months, and the participants’ awareness ( aIbasic/H110050.09,
SE/H110050.03, p/H11021.01), participants’ intention to be sufficiently
physically active ( aIbasic/H110050.39, SE/H110050.12, p/H11021.001), and
participants’ action planning skills over 6 months ( aIbasic/H110050.13,
SE/H110050.07, p/H11005.06) compared with the control condition, although
the latter association was borderline significant. The intervention-plus condition was found to have positively changed the partici-pants’ perception of social modeling ( a
Iplus/H110050.17, SE/H110050.08,
p/H11021.05), participants’ awareness ( aIplus/H110050.08, SE/H110050.03, p/H11021
.01), environmental perceptions ( aIplus/H110050.48, SE/H110050.16, p/H11021
.001), intention ( aIplus/H110050.40, SE/H110050.12, p/H11021.001), and com -
mitment to PA behavior ( aIplus/H110050.06, SE/H110050.03, p/H11021.05)
compared with the control condition.
Mediator Effect on PA Behavior ( bpath)
The second step of the mediation analysis was to estimate
whether the changes in the mediator were associated with changesin weekly days and weekly minutes of PA behavior over 12months ( bcoefficient). Table 3 shows the results of the multiple
regression model. Changes in total weekly days of PA werepredicted by changes in participants’ awareness ( b/H110050.57, SE/H11005
0.14, p/H11021.001), sports partner ( b/H11005/H11002 0.41, SE/H110050.16, p/H11021.01),
and self-efficacy ( b/H110050.28, SE/H110050.14, p/H11021.01) over 3 months
and by changes in participants’ awareness ( b/H110050.44, SE/H110050.14,
p/H11021.001), strategic planning behavior ( b/H110050.39, SE/H110050.15, p/H11021
.01), and intention ( b/H110050.19, SE/H110050.05, p/H11021.001) over 6 months.
Changes in total weekly minutes of PA over 12 months were pre-dicted by changes in self-efficacy ( b/H1100567.5, SE/H1100530.8, p/H11021.05) and
changes in strategic planning ( b/H1100579.3, SE/H1100532.8, p/H11021.05).
Mediated Effects ( abcoefficient)
The last step of the mediation analysis estimated whether the
potential mediators significantly mediated the intervention effectand what proportion of the intervention effect could be explainedby the total mediated effect. Table 3 presents the specific mediatedeffects ( abcoefficient), which are the independent mediated effect
of each individual potential mediator and the proportion of eachspecific mediated effect on the total intervention effect (% ME). Inboth intervention conditions, the intervention effects on totalweekly days of PA were mediated by changes in awareness ( ab

For the basic computer-tailored print intervention, the direct

Discussion
We aimed to examine the efficacy of two computer-tailored PA
intervention studies in changing PA behavior in older adults in thelong term (1 year after the start of the intervention) and to identifythe mediating mechanisms through which the interventions in-duced their effect on PA behavior. Based on the results, we coulddraw three conclusions.
First, the two computer-tailored PA interventions had significant
positive effects on the total weekly days of PA of older adults inthe longer term. Small effect sizes (ES /H110050.18) were found for
both interventions. These findings are important considering theneed for effective long-term PA promotion interventions for thisage group. Although several studies found short-term effects ofprint computer-tailored PA interventions for older adults (Janceyet al., 2008; Walker et al., 2009), to our knowledge, only one studyhas assessed the long-term efficacy of a print computer-tailoredintervention in this specific age group (Greaney et al., 2008).Contrary to our study, Greaney et al. (2008) found no significantlong-term effects. Our results are consistent with the findings ofstudies analyzing the long-term efficacy of (tailored) PA telephonecounseling interventions in older adults (Kolt, Schofield, Kerse,Garrett, & Oliver, 2007; Pinto, Goldstein, Ashba, Sciamanna, &Jette, 2005).
Although both interventions were effective in changing total
weekly days of PA, only the environmental intervention waseffective in changing total weekly minutes of PA. In-depth anal-yses (unpublished data) showed that this increase in weekly min-utes of PA in environmental intervention participants was due toan increase in both days of PA per week and a nonsignificantincrease in minutes of PA on days they were active. Participants ofthe basic intervention, on the other hand, only increased weeklydays of PA and (nonsignificantly) decreased minutes of PA perday. Although the basic intervention was able to increase thenumber of PA days, it did not significantly increase the totalamount of PA. This can be explained by the provided environ-mental information in the environmental condition. The cycling/walking routes could have initiated cycling/walking on a dayparticipants were already active, thereby increasing both weeklydays and daily minutes of PA. The results indicate that the two PAmeasures are different, and both outcomes should be presented inthe future.
Second, awareness of personal PA level and intention to be
sufficiently active were mediators of the intervention effect onweekly days of PA. The results confirm that awareness of personal
PA level is important in changing PA behavior and support theo-retical models such as the precaution adoption process model(Weinstein, 1988), the health action process approach (Schwarzer,2009), and I-Change model (De Vries et al., 2006). Studies haveshown that people have a tendency to overestimate their PAbehavior, in which they incorrectly think their PA behavior issufficient (Lechner et al., 2006; Ronda, Van Assema, & Brug,2001). Consequently, people unaware of their personal insufficientPA level do not perceive a need to change. In our study, the twointerventions focused explicitly on increasing awareness of peo-ple’s own PA level by providing personalized and normativefeedback of participants’ own PA level compared with the PAguidelines and PA level of others. The effectiveness of theseintervention strategies can be confirmed by two computer-tailoredinterventions targeting nutrition behavior using similar strategies(Kroeze, Oenema, Dagnelie, & Brug, 2008; Oenema & Brug,2003). Intention was targeted directly by providing computer-tailored feedback about participants’ intention and indirectly bytargeting participants’ attitude, self-efficacy, and social influence.This multicomponent nature of the intervention makes it hard todraw definite conclusions on the pathway that caused the increasein intention. No other significant mediators were identified, whichis in contrast to some other PA interventions for older adults thatfound mediating effects of self-efficacy (Brassington, Atienza,Perczek, DiLorenzo, & King, 2002; Michael & Carlson, 2009),attitude (Brassington et al., 2002; Pinto, Lynn, Marcus, DePue, &Goldstein, 2001), and social influences (Barrera, Toobert, Angell,Glasgow, & Mackinnon, 2006), although some studies could not,as in our study, confirm these results (Brassington et al., 2002;McAuley, Courneya, Rudolph, & Lox, 1994; Michael & Carlson,2009; Pinto et al., 2001).
In contrast to our expectations, we found no differences in
working mechanisms between the two interventions. Although theenvironmental intervention yielded changes in perceived environ-ment, its intervention effect on PA behavior was not mediated bythese changes in the multiple mediation models. In a single me-diation model, on the other hand, we found that environmentalperceptions mediated the effect of the environmental interventionon weekly days of PA (results not presented in this study). Thissuggests that the association between perceived environment andweekly days of PA is mediated by a more proximal variable (e.g.,awareness or intention). This confirms theoretical models such asthe I-Change model (De Vries et al., 2006) or the environmentalresearch framework for weight gain prevention framework (Kre-mers et al., 2006), which assume that environmental conceptsindirectly influence health behaviors via more proximal awarenessor motivational factors. Although the environmental interventiontargeted social environmental mediators (e.g., providing access toa website with a forum and e-buddy system to stimulate socialinfluences), the intervention did not additionally affect the socialenvironmental mediators. This could be explained by the lownumber of intervention-plus participants (i.e., 11%) who had ac-tually visited the website (van Stralen et al., 2009b).
Third, based our mediation analyses, recommendations for fu-
ture interventions aimed at changing PA in older adults can bemade. Intervention developers should add the significant interven-tion strategies that increased awareness and intention to theirintervention. In our cases, a mediating effect was not confirmed,

but future research can be informed in two ways. First, if a change
in a concept did not affect the outcome (i.e., social modeling), thisconcept may be irrelevant in changing the behavior and should beremoved from the intervention. Other explanations are that ourstudy lacked power, the mediator’s indirect influence of behaviorvia other mediators (Ajzen, 1991; De Vries et al., 2006), insensi-tivity of our measures, or a low variability in the mediators(Hafeman & Schwartz, 2009). Second, in case the interventionsdid not affect the mediator (i.e., self-regulation and self-efficacy),the strategies targeting these mediators could have been ineffec-tive, the study lacked power, the measures were insensitive (Hafe-man & Schwartz, 2009), or the intervention was ineffective insubgroups (e.g., unmotivated participants). In-depth analysis (notpresented in this study) showed that some strategies (e.g., fill in anaction plan) were effective in changing a targeted mediator amongthe participants who applied the strategy. However, because onlya few participants applied this strategy (e.g., 49 vs. 640 who didnot; van Stralen et al., 2009a), no overall intervention effect wasdetected. Therefore, before adapting or deleting the interventioncomponents, in-depth analyses are needed to study the effective-ness of the intervention strategies in participants who adequatelyused the strategy.
Our study was subject to some limitations. First, the measure-
ments of mediators and outcomes relied on self-report. The resultscould therefore be biased by social desirability and overreporting.Furthermore, given that we measured changes in mediators at 3and 6 months, it is very likely that, because of changes in PA,several mediators have continued to improve over time (e.g.,self-efficacy, intention, awareness). Therefore, if the mediatorswould have been measured at 12 instead of 3 or 6 months, theirassociation with PA might have been stronger, resulting in strongermediated effects. Third, generalizing the results might be biased bythe initial response and selective dropout. Intervention participantswere about twice as likely to drop out as control participants. Apossible reason for this higher dropout is that intervention partic-ipants, who had made fewer PA changes, had fewer reasons tocontinue. Furthermore, because intervention participants receivedtheir advice at the start, they could have been less reluctant toremain in the study and return additional questionnaires. Waitlistcontrol participants, on the other hand, had the prospect of receiv-ing computer-tailored advice at the end and could have been moremotivated to stay in the study. Higher dropout rates among inter-vention participants have also been reported in other computer-tailored intervention studies (Oenema, Tan, & Brug, 2005; Spit-taels, De Bourdeaudhuij, & Vandelanotte, 2007). By analyzing thetotal data set, including the missing data using multilevel analyses,we tried to account for selective dropout (Twisk & de Vente,2002). Fourth, the measures might not have been sensitive enoughto detect changes in the mediators. Most of our mediator measureswere translated and adapted from existing validated questionnairesbecause validated Dutch measures are not available. Although thequestionnaire was tested for indicators of construct validity (vanBree, 2006), it was not tested for internal validity or sensitivity.
To conclude, the two interventions were effective in changing
weekly days of sufficient PA in older adults. In addition, theenvironmental intervention was effective in changing weekly min-utes of PA. Awareness of personal PA level and intention to besufficiently active were found to be significant mediators of theintervention effect on weekly days of PA. In total, 41% and 37%of the total intervention effects on weekly days of PA of the basic
computer-tailored intervention and environmental intervention, re-spectively, could be explained by changes in the targeted media-tors. This indicates that the interventions were effective in chang-ing some of the mediators, and that the changes in some of themediators induced by the interventions were causally associatedwith PA behavior change.
