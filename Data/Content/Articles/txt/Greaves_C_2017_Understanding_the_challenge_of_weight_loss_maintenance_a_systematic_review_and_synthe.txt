ABSTRACT
Behaviour change interventions can be effective in helping people to lose
weight, but weight is often regained. Effective interventions are required
to prevent this. We conducted a systematic review and synthesis of
qualitative research on people ’s experiences of weight loss maintenance.
We searched bibliographic databases for qualitative studies about the
experience of currently or previously overweight adults trying to
maintain weight loss. We thematically synthesised study findings to
develop a model of weight loss maintenance. Twenty six studies from
five countries with 710 participants were included. The modeldeveloped through our synthesis proposes that making the behaviour
changes required for weight loss maintenance generates psychological
‘tension ’due to the need to override existing habits, and incompatibility
of the new behaviours with the fulfilment of psychological needs.Successful maintenance involves management or resolution of thistension. Management of tension can be achieved through self-
regulation, renewing of motivation and managing external influences,
although this can require constant effort. Resolution may be achieved
through changing habits, finding non-obesogenic methods for
addressing needs, and potentially through change in self-concept.Implications for the development of weight loss maintenance
interventions are explored.ARTICLE HISTORY

Managing obesity to prevent type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other health conditions is a
major global priority (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2014 ; World Health
Organisation [WHO], 2014 ). However, although a number of effective interventions and key interven-
tion components for weight loss have been identified (Adams et al., 2012 ; Greaves et al., 2011 ; Padwal
& Majumdar, 2007 ), weight regain is common (Dansinger, Tatsioni, Wong, Chung, & Balk, 2007 ; Dom-
browski, Knittle, Avenell, Araujo-Soares, & Sniehotta, 2014 ). Following non-surgical interventions,
people regain, on average, a third of the weight lost within a year and the rest in 3 –5 years
(Avenell et al., 2004 ; Dansinger et al., 2007 ). Even following bariatric surgery, around a quarter of
the initial weight loss is regained over 6 –10 years (Adams et al., 2012 ; Sjostrom, 2013 ). In order to
address this, it is important to understand more about the phenomenon of weight regain.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2017.1299583
A recent review of individual interventions to support weight loss maintenance found that the rate
of weight regain can be reduced by a mean 1.6 kg per year (Dombrowski et al., 2014 ) and several
specific intervention techniques, such as self-regulation (goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback)
and problem solving, as well as increased physical activity, are associated with increased success
(Madigan et al., 2014 ; Simpson, Shaw, & McNamara, 2011 ). However, even though some individuals
are able to maintain weight loss with such interventions, on average weight is still regained. These
reviews also show that the intervention methods used to support maintenance largely replicate or
extend the same methods used for initial weight loss.
Further insights into the phenomenon of weight regain may be obtained through qualitative
research methods. Qualitative research can focus on the perspectives and experiences of the persontrying to maintain weight loss and provides an opportunity for theory building. Understanding thecomplex social, contextual, cognitive and emotional influences on weight loss maintenance might
also help to identify new, innovative intervention strategies. A common criticism of qualitative
studies is that their transferability may be limited to some extent by their sample size and the specificsetting or population studied. However, it is possible to combine the findings of such studies using
meta-synthesis (Barnett-Page & Thomas, 2009 ; Britten et al., 2002 ). This can generate a more in-
depth understanding of the problem and may help to formulate models and theories that are appli-
cable to a broader range of contexts (Barnett-Page & Thomas, 2009 ). Meta-synthesis of qualitative
data has been used to help build understanding of a range of health conditions and develop interven-tions to address them (Britten et al., 2002 ; Carroll, Booth, & Cooper, 2011 ; Wingham, Harding, Britten, &
Dalal, 2014 ). In this study, we systematically reviewed qualitative studies of weight loss maintenance or
weight regain in adults, and synthesised their findings. The aims of the synthesis were to (a) identify therange of factors and strategies that influence weight loss maintenance and (b) generate a conceptualmodel that might inform future interventions.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and thematic synthesis (Thomas & Harden, 2008 ) of qualitative
studies of weight loss maintenance. The study protocol is available on the PROSPERO register(CRD42014008666), and this report follows ENTREQ guidance for reporting qualitative syntheses
(Tong, Flemming, McInnes, Oliver, & Craig, 2012 ).
Eligibility criteria
We included peer-reviewed papers published since 1990 in English which qualitatively assessed the
views of currently or previously overweight adults about the maintenance of intentional weight loss.
Studies that addressed maintenance within a broader investigation of weight management (e.g.,
mixed methods studies) were included if they contained substantial material relating specifically tomaintenance. Based on assessment by two independent reviewers and negotiation around any dis-
agreements, we classified articles as having ‘substantial material ’if weight loss maintenance was a
major focus of the study, or if at least several paragraphs of data or interpretation were concerned
with weight loss maintenance. Papers were excluded if the study population changed weight due to
pregnancy, or as a side effect of medication, an eating disorder or other medical condition.
Literature search
We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA, International Bibliography of the Social
Sciences (IBSS) and Social Sciences Citation Index, using controlled vocabulary and free text search
terms relating to overweight, weight management and weight loss maintenance. We adapted an exist-
ing evidence based search filter to identify qualitative studies (Wong, Wilczynski, & Haynes, 2004 ). Sup-
plementary File 1 provides details of the search strategy. We conducted a ‘berry picking ’search,146 C .G R E A V E SE TA L .
whereby we entered the titles of our included papers into Google Scholar and used the ‘related articles ’
feature to identify potential additional articles. We also tracked citations from the reference lists of
included publications using Web of Science, and consulted the authors of included studies where poss-
ible, in July 2014, along with 15 other experts in the field who were known to the authors, to identify
relevant papers. The search was first conducted in February 2104 and updated in October 2015.
Screening and data extraction
Titles and abstracts were screened, and full texts obtained for any potentially eligible papers. Thesewere read in full to establish eligibility and categorised according to the attention they gave to weightloss maintenance (coded as substantial, partial and minor or unclear). Only those in the ‘substantial ’
category were included in the synthesis. Study and participant characteristics were extracted, alongwith descriptions of features relevant to quality appraisal. The text of included studies was coded andorganised using NVivo 10. Screening and data extraction was conducted by one researcher, and
another independently screened 25% of papers both at this stage and during full text screening.
Any disagreements were resolved by discussion but agreement levels were above 95% in each case.
Study appraisal
There is no clear consensus on methods for the appraisal of methodological quality in qualitative synth-eses (Hannes & Macaitis, 2012 ). We appraised the studies on the basis of their trustworthiness, transfer-
ability and usefulness to our study, including assessment of methods of data collection and analysis,
sample characteristics and study context (Wallace et al., 2006 ;W a l s h&D o w n e , 2006 ). We assigned a
rating of low, moderate or substantial for methodological quality and (separately) for value to our syn-
thesis, based on the quality assessment criteria provided in Supplementary File 2. One researcher
(Author2) appraised all the included studies and another (Author1) checked these ratings. All disagree-
ments on study quality and usefulness were discussed and resolved between these two researchers.The appraisal process was not used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the synthesis, but to
inform judgements about the strength of evidence for different elements of the synthesis, and as a
source of information to help account for any discrepancies between study findings.
Analysis and synthesis
We adapted thematic synthesis methods described by Thomas and Harden ( 2008 ). Text and tables
from the abstracts, results and discussion sections of papers were coded line by line to identify
themes relating to weight loss maintenance. Coded data were additionally categorised as either ver-
batim quotes from study participants or interpretations by study authors. This process was initiallyconducted with eight papers, selected to represent a range of study populations and methods. Analy-
sis was conducted independently by two researchers (Author 1, Author2), both of whom had training
and experience in qualitative research methods and evidence synthesis. The resulting coding anddescriptive themes were compared, discussed and agreed at several meetings. The remaining
papers were then coded line by line by one researcher, and read by both researchers to identify
any new themes or data suggesting variance or dissonance within or between studies. Summariesof the main findings and any models proposed in each study were also agreed. The reviewers met
several times during the analysis process to generate a synthesis comprising higher level interpretive
concepts and an explanatory model linking them. Themes and concepts were iteratively developedby repeated comparison with extracted material from the individual studies, giving particular atten-
tion to identifying and seeking explanations for any deviant cases or dissonant themes. The sum-
maries we created from the main findings of each study were also consulted, to ensure that theintegrity of these findings was preserved in the synthesis.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 147
We conducted a sensitivity analysis (Carroll, Booth, & Lloyd-Jones, 2012 ) to investigate whether any
elements of the synthesis depended on the inclusion of lower quality studies. This involved removing
the data from lower quality studies and checking the remaining level of support for the themes and
concepts we had generated. Using a similar method, we also considered whether our findings were
influenced by the inclusion of studies where bariatric surgery was used for initial weight loss.

mentioned but not given substantial coverage, or was not distinguished from weight loss, were
excluded from the synthesis (see Supplementary File 3).
Study characteristics and appraisal
Supplementary File 4 shows the characteristics of the included studies, which were conducted inAustralia (2), Finland (3), Greece (1), Ireland (1), Sweden (2), the US (10) and the UK (7). Theyinvolved a total of 710 participants, 552 of whom (78%) were women. Ethnicity was not always
reported but studies included African American, Caucasian and multi ethnic samples. Of the
total sample, 296 participants (42%) were classed as successful weight loss maintainers. Definitionsof successful weight loss maintenance varied, but the most common required maintenance of at
least 10% bodyweight loss for at least one year. In many cases the weight loss was greater and the
maintenance periods were considerably longer. Seventeen studies specified that participants hadinitially lost weight by behaviour change alone; participants in five studies had bariatric surgery;
and five studies did not specify the methods of initial weight loss. Eleven studies made explicit
comparisons between successful and unsuccessful weight loss maintainers. One study includedinterviews with 10 people who had stopped smoking (and were not trying to manage their
weight), and three studies included 33 lifetime healthy weight maintainers. However, it was poss-
ible to identify the views of people who had experience of trying to maintain weight loss in thesestudies, so they were retained.
Our appraisal of the methodological qualities of the included studies and their value to our syn-
thesis is summarised in Supplementary File 5. Only one study (Engstrom & Forsberg, 2011 ) was
longitudinal, tracing changes in people ’s perceptions over time; the remainder were cross-sectional.
Data collection was through focus groups (6 studies), or individual interviews which were eitherface to face (15 studies), by telephone (2 studies) or email exchange (1 study), or using a combi-nation of focus groups and face-to-face individual interviews (2 studies). Evidence of trustworthi-
ness was substantial in 4 studies, moderate in 13 and limited in 9 (see Supplementary File 5 for
details). The main areas where trustworthiness was potentially threatened were lack of supportingquotes for interpretations, poor descriptions of recruitment and sampling, and poor evidence of
researcher reflexivity. All but one paper were considered to be of moderate or high value to the
synthesis.
Synthesis
Based on our analysis and interpretation of the data, we developed a set of common descriptivethemes and sub-themes representing the data from the included studies. In doing this, we ident-
ified a number of factors (physiological, social, environmental or psychological influences on
weight loss maintenance) and strategies (cognitive or behavioural approaches adopted by theindividual to assist their weight loss maintenance). In keeping with the principles of thematic syn-
thesis, we also developed ‘third order interpretations ’(reviewer-generated concepts) that go
beyond the content of original studies (Thomas & Harden, 2008 ). This included a conceptual
model of weight loss maintenance. In the following account, the themes (in italics) are organisedwithin the conceptual framework that we developed. Table 1 indicates which studies supported
each theme, either through participant quotes or interpretations made by their authors. Illustra-
tive quotes are from the authors of papers unless specified as being from a study participant,
and participant descriptors are given where available. A more detailed table of quotes is in
Supplementary File 6. The account is followed by a description and illustration ( Figure 2 )o f
the conceptual model that we developed to organise and relate the themes and concepts to
each other.HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 149

The tension of maintenance
Maintaining the changes is a struggle
Both weight regainers and maintainers depicted weight management as a constant battle, requiring
significant and ongoing mental effort and resources and leading to cognitive fatigue. This was experi-
enced both when trying to eat more healthily and when trying to increase physical activity. ‘Look, the
maintenance phase is always the hardest for me. For I have to eat as much as when dieting, without
losing weight ’(Maintainer) (Karfopoulou, Mouliou, Koutras, & Yannakoulia, 2013 ). For many, it exacted
an increasing toll, leading to instability in weight management behaviours, and a downward spiral inwhich negative thought patterns, maladaptive learning and poor coping strategies reinforced oneanother, eventually resulting in relapse and a return to the previous obesogenic lifestyle.
Sources of tension
Old habits and impulses
Several sources of the above-mentioned tension were identified. Firstly, changing obesogenic beha-
viours involves breaking old, often long-ingrained habits and making new ones. Study authors noted
the ever present potential to return to former eating or sedentary habits and a sense of being‘somehow stuck with or habituated in a certain kind of lifestyle ’(Jallinoja, Pajari, & Absetz, 2008 )o r
being constantly ‘on guard ’against their return (Lynch & Bisogni, 2014 ). One participant (regainer)
reported that ‘It was very gradual. I didn ’t really notice it. Kind of slipped back into old habits and
it sort of crept on over a few years and then sort of escalated ’(Reilly et al., 2015 ). Related to this is
the acknowledgement of impulsive responses to the presence of tempting foods in the environmentas a particular problem. When tasty (and unhealthy) foods were present or offered, some individualsexperienced transitory but strong impulses to overeat or ‘food cravings ’, which could precipitate
lapses (Green, Larkin, & Sullivan, 2009 ; Lynch & Bisogni, 2014 ).
Unmet needs
A second source of tension was the failure of new behaviour patterns to meet personal needs pre-
viously served by obesogenic behaviours. Unhealthy eating was widely cited as a strategy to help
regulate emotion or stress, for the relief of boredom, and for delivery of simple pleasure. Followingweight loss through bariatric surgery, one participant said ‘I eat when I ’m sad, when I need comfort,
when I celebrate or when I ’m happy or hungry.’ (Engstrom & Forsberg, 2011 ). In some cases, the need
to overeat was characterised by respondents as a personal addiction. It was also seen as a necessarypart of social or cultural engagement (e.g., eating for celebration or to fit in with a particular socialTable 1. Continued.

group). ‘I found the only way around going out with friends was to sit at the table and not eat. That ’s
very hard ’(Regainer) (Janse Van Vuuren, Strodl, White, & Lockie, 2015 ). Similarly, changes in physical
activity could conflict with other priorities in life (often expressed as time pressure), or the need for
social inclusion (e.g., through embarrassment around exercising in public). If behaviour changes for
weight management disrupted the fulfilment of such needs, they could generate a sense of innerconflict. This was particularly evident among those who had undergone bariatric surgery, for
whom the sudden incapacity to consume food for emotional regulation (and the effects on social
eating) could be intensely distressing (Janse Van Vuuren et al., 2015 ).
Thoughts and beliefs about identity or self-concept
Tension could also be generated when new behaviours, or weight loss itself, appeared to cause con-
flicts with self-concept or identity. As one participant put it, ‘It’s a regime isn ’t it, and I probably rebel
from that a bit …so I, for me, I need to tame my –not my spirit, but personality I suppose ’(Green
et al., 2009 ). The conflict was expressed as a struggle between the individual ’s‘good ’and ‘bad’
selves in everyday life (Green et al., 2009 ), and as of ‘a tension between the [individual ’s] obese
past and the present day ’(Sarlio-Lähteenkorva, 2000 ). For some, weight loss was associated with a
loss of physical power or sexual attractiveness (Sarlio-Lahteenkorva, 1998 ; Sarlio-Lähteenkorva,
2000 ). There was also discomfort at the perceived requirement to stigmatise the previous ‘overweight
me’, and a sense of loss of a previous carefree self, unconstrained by a societal obsession with thin
and perfect bodies. Weight management could also be seen as threatening social identity, forinstance as a fun-loving, hedonistic member of a social group, or as a caring parent and spouse,
who shows their love through providing (unhealthy) food to the family.
Thoughts and beliefs about weight management
These also fuelled inner conflict. Weight regainers often viewed weight management as a rigid, rulebound, all-or-nothing affair, to be endured temporarily until they lost weight. This often evoked asense of deprivation and negativity or resentment, so that even positive outcomes could be
judged as unsatisfactory. One regainer stated ‘I have very strict ideas about what failure and
success are made of. In my head, I always think I ’d like to be 8 stone. Obviously if you don ’t get to
8 stone you ’re still fat’ (Byrne, Cooper, & Fairburn, 2003 ). Catastrophic thinking (i.e., thoughts of
failure and hopelessness) in response to lapses was reported as a particularly negative pattern of
thought that could lead to abandonment of weight management efforts.
It’s an obvious self-defeating concept that just because you have eaten one bad thing you should then eat lots of
it. It’s some sort of weird psychological thing to think it ’s all or nothing; if you can ’t do it perfectly you might as
well not do it at all. (Maintainer) (McKee, Ntoumanis, & Smith, 2013 )
These negative scripts could become self-ful ﬁlling as they undermined self-ef ﬁcacy and belief in the
possibility of positive outcomes (McKee et al., 2013 ).
Tension also appeared to be generated by conflict between lifestyle change and other priorities in
life. This is captured in the model by the need for social inclusion (e.g., to prioritise the needs of otherpeople). It also applies to some modifiers of tension (e.g., time pressures) and to some identity-related
beliefs (e.g., being competent at one’s job). ‘I’m everywhere. I ’m working and I ’m doing their home-
work and it ’s all that tumbling down on top of you and you see you just grab whatever’ (Participant)
(Reilly et al., 2015 ).
Modifiers of the tension
Factors influencing the challenge of maintenance
The tension of maintenance was experienced as a dynamic phenomenon, modified by personal,
social and environmental factors that could change over time and in intensity (represented asthe outer ring in Figure 2 ). Personal factors include illness and mood, which may cause sudden152 C .G R E A V E SE TA L .
spikes in the tension of maintenance. The attitudes and behaviours of family and friends were
thought to be particularly important external factors, influencing personal attitudes, motivationand maintenance behaviours. For example, one post-bariatric surgery female participant reported
that ‘My mom is self-destructive and disapproving. She ’s a saboteur. She says that she wants to
help me, but then she makes me brownies. It ’s frustrating ’(Benson-Davies, Davies, & Kattelmann,
2013 ). Karfopoulou et al. ( 2013 ) reported that ‘external factors leading to changes in everyday rou-
tines were frequently mentioned as causal, such as changes in marital status, changes at work,
moving house or ﬁnancial issues ’.
The challenge of weight loss maintenance is therefore to deal with the tension generated by chan-
ging habits, disrupting personal needs fulfilment and conflict with beliefs, and to manage the manycontextual factors that influence the tension. Our analysis suggested two main ways of dealing with
the tension of weight loss maintenance: managing it and resolving it.
Managing the tension
Learning and insight
Several studies depicted a weight management journey in which the process of individual change is
driven by learning through repeated experiences of dealing with the tensions of maintenance. The
learning can be maladaptive, so that weight management becomes increasingly difficult. Forexample, some studies suggested regainers could become trapped in a negative emotional –cogni-
tive–behavioural cycle in which eating provided temporary relief for negative feelings about body
image, but the resulting weight gain provoked further negative feelings and guilt, as well as amore generalised lowering of self-esteem and self-confidence. The ‘lessons ’learned from experience
in this scenario were counterproductive, increasing the chances of failure. In contrast, successfulmaintainers reported adaptive learning from their experiences of both success and failure inweight management. They ‘learned from past mistakes, made adjustments, and moved on ’(Berry,
2004 ). More broadly, maintainers learned ‘what works for me ’and found lifestyle behaviours that
would be sustainable for them in the long term.
Over time, some individuals reported an increased awareness of how their weight related beha-
viours were influenced by personal attitudes, emotions, personal needs, other people and externalcircumstances. Study participants referred to specific insights that led to a breakthrough in eithertheir attitudes or approach to weight management. For example, a realisation that food was being
used to manage stress or boredom stimulated some participants to find alternative ways to
manage these feelings (Benson-Davies et al., 2013 ; Haeffele, Trunnell, & Kinney, 2011 ).
This type of learning creates a dynamic that supports long-term weight loss maintenance: Bertz,
Sparud-Lundin, and Winkvist ( 2015 ) propose that the experience of a successful outcome following
behavioural changes may increase motivation, improve self-image, and through repetition of this vir-tuous cycle lead to the eventual alignment of previously conflicting, cognitive and emotional drivers
(Bertz et al., 2015 ). This positive feedback can then support further change and persistence with
weight loss efforts. Furthermore, as people become increasingly skilful in managing the tension of
maintenance, some reported that the effort required decreased over time (Haeffele et al., 2011 ;
Jallinoja et al., 2008 ).
Self-regulation
Many of the strategies reported by successful maintainers are examples of self-regulation. Theseinclude setting targets and goals, regular self-monitoring of behaviour and outcomes, makingplans to deal with ‘high risk situations ’, and responding quickly to lapses. So, for example, maintainers
regularly checked their weight (by direct measurement, monitoring body shape, clothing fit or a moregeneral sense of fitness and well-being). They also set boundaries for what constituted acceptableweight variation and used these as triggers for compensatory action when a lapse occurred. OneHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 153
maintainer stated ‘I give myself 10 pounds, but once you get to 10 pounds, turning that ship around is
hard. So maybe I ’ll adjust it to five pounds to be my alarm weight ’(Reyes et al., 2012 ). Maintainers also
reported using a stepwise approach to lapse management, in which eating and physical activity plans
were normally flexible, but became more rigid (and more intensively managed) when warning signs
were observed. Flexible restraint was a key principle for many maintainers, and rigidity was regardedas counterproductive, since it could increase the tension of weight management and so made
sudden relapse more likely. These approaches contrasted with those of weight regainers, who
appeared to use self-regulatory practices inconsistently or not at all. Self-weighing was unpopularbecause it might generate unwelcome news, and although in some cases weight gain boundaries
were set, they were often ignored or reset when crossed, to avoid the perception of failure or the
need to take remedial action (Chambers & Swanson, 2012 ).
Managing internal and external influences
Maintainers reported that they actively identified and found ways of addressing the personal and
contextual factors that modified the tension of maintenance. They established explicit strategies
to identify and deal with high risk situations such as sudden impulses to overeat, holidays, socialeating events, stress and low mood. Stuckey et al. ( 2011 ) report that participants ‘planned their
meals for the day in advance to avoid impulsive behaviour ’. Other strategies included engaging
family or friends in weight management behaviours, not giving in to peer pressure to eat more,and choosing not to attend social eating occasions.
Some people used to tell me that I look bad, that my body is too skinny and my complexion looks old. They say
that I am not like I used to be. I have told them that I don ’t intend to be like I used to be. I wanted to change and I
have changed, (Maintainer) (Sarlio-Lähteenkorva, 2000 )
In contrast, regainers ’strategies for managing these inﬂ uences were poorly developed (McKee et al.,
2013 ). Their accounts often suggested a relationship of dependence on external factors, particularly
social in ﬂuences. For instance, many reported dependence on ongoing social support programmes
for weight management, because of the sense of peer acceptance, guidance and accountability they
provided. Some maintainers also valued such support, but others were ambivalent about ongoinggroup membership because they perceived it as reducing their sense of personal control (Jallinoja
et al., 2008 ). These ﬁndings are consistent with the idea that successful maintenance depends on
management ofexternal in ﬂuences rather than management bythem.
Willpower or motivation
Several studies reported that successful maintenance required new sources of motivation, as motiv-ations that were present during weight loss (e.g., awareness of improvements in functional capacity,
positive feedback from others) became less noticeable (Cioffi, 2002 ; Karfopoulou et al., 2013 ; Reyes
et al., 2012 ). This presented a problem for those who needed ongoing motivation or ‘willpower ’to
resist the tension created by their behaviour change, particularly in times of acute stress (Hindle &Carpenter, 2011 ). Some maintainers found new motivation through a sense of determination not
to return to the ‘old me ’, or by setting themselves new goals that required or would result in
either maintenance or further weight loss. As one maintainer put it,
I could not appear at my workplace as an overblown fatty. Many in the audience would just stare at my fat body
and miss the words. I used to do that myself. When I was obese, I always focused on the body shapes of others.
This work requires that I am presentable, all the time. (Sarlio-Lähteenkorva, 2000 )
Some people reported a need for extrinsic motivators, such as peer support from weight manage-
ment groups (Hindle & Carpenter, 2011 )o r ‘catalytic interactions ’from care providers (Bertz et al.,
2015 ). For successful maintainers, however, there was evidence of increased intrinsic motivation as
they found enjoyment and satisfaction in lifestyle behaviours that underpinned their weight
control, particularly physical exercise (Chambers & Swanson, 2012 ; Stuckey et al., 2011 ), and less154 C .G R E A V E SE TA L .
dependence on external ‘pushes’ (Haeffele et al., 2011 ; Sarlio-Lähteenkorva, 2000 ). These findings
suggest that motivations for weight management change over time as individuals transition from
weight loss to maintenance, and that intrinsic motivation may be particularly important to
maintenance.
Reducing the tension
The data suggested that successful maintainers found ways to go beyond resisting the tension of
maintenance (fighting a never ending battle), and took steps to reduce or eliminate it. When this hap-
pened, it led to a more stable and less effortful pattern of weight maintenance. We identified three
distinct ways that tension could be reduced or resolved.
Developing automaticity
Although some maintainers experienced an ongoing struggle with managing their weight, othersreported that the new patterns of thinking and behaviour associated with their new lifestyle
became more automated and habitual over time. These ‘advanced maintainers ’thought less
about their eating and physical activity behaviours and described them as ‘automatically pro-
grammed, natural and not subject to change ’(Haeffele et al., 2011 ). In such cases, motivation
seemed to play a lesser role, since the desired behaviours were enacted unconsciously, and did
not drain cognitive resources. Maintainers actively used habit changing strategies, such as identifyingsituations in which unhelpful behavioural habits occurred and repeatedly using self-talk, distraction
or other techniques to challenge the existing habit and establish an alternative, healthier habit in its
stead. ‘The dif ﬁcult bit was coming up with what that new routine would be but once that was in
place it was kind of comforting’ (Maintainer) (McKee et al., 2013 ).
Other examples included using cues or reminders to associate the new behaviours with particular
contexts or times of day. For example, this could involve putting running shoes by the bed to stepinto each morning (Haeffele et al., 2011 ), or substituting chocolate with a lower calorie alternative
when watching evening TV –effectively ‘piggy backing ’on old habits to create new ones. Self-regu-
latory strategies, particularly self-monitoring and compensating for lapses, were also reported ashabitual by some maintainers. Initially, the repetition of these strategies required considerable cog-
nitive resources, but in time they became automatic, and were no longer experienced as a burden.
Successful maintainers sought to make habits of the behaviours they used to lose weight and toreplace unhealthy habits with healthier and sustainable eating and physical activity behaviours
that they found worked for them personally, or that fitted well with their lifestyle (Stuckey et al., 2011 ).
In contrast, regainers often treated weight loss behaviours as temporary measures and were less
likely to convert them into habits. Post bariatric surgery, some people reported initial improvementsin eating behaviours and a renewed sense of self-control, but others regressed. This was because their
initially healthier food choices were driven by temporary adverse physiological responses to poor diet(e.g., rejection of fatty foods) rather than enjoyment, so once the physiological response reduced, old
habits could return (Engstrom & Forsberg, 2011 ).
Meeting needs more healthily
Some maintainers reported finding alternative means of meeting needs that were previously fulfilled
by obesogenic behaviours. For instance, some addressed perceived hunger with low calorie drinks(Karfopoulou et al., 2013 ), and others used physical exercise rather than food as a way to destress
(Benson-Davies et al., 2013 ) or to provide a ‘high’ (Green et al., 2009 ), or used other techniques
such as self-talk, distraction or relaxation techniques to manage stress. The most common strategyto deal with emotional eating was to employ an alternative activity to either distract participants
from the desire to eat or ‘to find some other release for what you are feeling ’(Participant –Lynch
& Bisogni, 2014 ) This approach required recognition of the needs that drive obesogenic behaviours
(Hindle & Carpenter, 2011 ), and experimentation to find alternative ways of meeting these needsHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 155
(Karfopoulou et al., 2013 ). It did not necessarily entail large step changes in the individual’ s lifestyle,
but could be achieved by implementing a series of smaller changes that still met the individual ’s
needs (Chambers & Swanson, 2012 ; Seale et al., 2013 ).
Changing beliefs and self-concept
The tension caused by unhelpful thoughts and beliefs can, in theory, be reduced by insights and by
finding alternative ways of thinking. For example, Maintainers tended to view weight management
less as a challenging project and more as a long-term change in lifestyle and were more positive
about even small achievements (Byrne et al., 2003 ). They did not regard lapses as disasters but as
events to learn from and move on from (McKee et al., 2013 ; Metzgar, Preston, Miller, & Nickols-
Richardson, 2014 ; Seale et al., 2013 ). Many still found weight control challenging, but a flexible,
self-forgiving and positive attitude was perceived as helpful.
In particular, successful long-term weight loss maintenance was often accompanied by changes in
self-concept (i.e., changes in the way individuals saw themselves and the way they related to theworld). As one maintainer stated, ‘I feel like a new person. My whole life has changed. I could
never go back again ’(Berry, 2004 ). In contrast to the narrative of being trapped or helpless reported
by some regainers, maintainers often talked about a growing sense of liberation and personal control,along with growing confidence and self-esteem and the emergence of a ‘new me ’. Epiphaniou and
Ogden ( 2010b ) reported that ‘Following weight loss maintenance, participants described a shift in
identity from that of a previously restricted individual who was restrained across a number of differ-ent domains, towards one who was liberated. ’Maintainers spoke of a more positive body image fol-
lowing weight loss, but also of a decreasing preoccupation with weight and shape, possibly because
their self-esteem was now less driven by body image and increasingly by other elements of their
identity. In contrast, for regainers, body image often remained central to the self-concept and self-esteem and could continue to evoke negative and debilitating self-appraisals.
For some maintainers, the new self-concept was associated with the healthier lifestyle they had
adopted, for instance, seeing themselves as (and taking pride in being) an active person (Epiphaniou& Ogden, 2010b ), a runner (Reyes et al., 2012 ), or a home chef (Barnes et al., 2007 ). Increased physical
activity was commonly reported as integral to the lifestyle of maintainers. In some cases it was specifi-cally seen as a weight control strategy, but in others it was more broadly embraced as part of theindividual ’s new life. Regainers, on the other hand, often saw physical exercise as incongruent
with their identity and lifestyle (Barnes et al., 2007 ; Chambers & Swanson, 2012 ).
The change in identity could go well beyond the realms of weight management, as the sense of
renewed confidence prompted a realisation that positive change was possible in other areas of life.
Maintainers described a process of evolution into a new person with a different outlook, social life,
priorities, leisure pursuits and career.
And it ’s everything, joy and belief in the future, work and what I manage at work, there is just no comparison.
Before it was just to get to work, to get out of the car, everything was a task, an effort and I often fell asleep
before I got out of the car at home, you know I even fell asleep in the yard, my children found me there,
because I could not manage any longer. And now when I get home it ’s like, well now I shall do this and that
and I have other activities besides my job, like evening courses, so there is no comparison. (Maintainer) (Engstrom& Forsberg, 2011 )
Overview and relationship between themes and synthesis concepts
The central concept of our analysis (represented by the spring in Figure 2 ) is that individuals experi-
ence a psychological conflict or ‘tension ’when making the behaviour changes required for sustained
weight loss. High levels of tension increase the likelihood of relapse and low tension is associated
with maintenance. This tension may arise from several sources: The new lifestyle may conflict with
existing habits, it may fail to satisfy personal needs or goals previously met by obesogenic behaviours(including social, emotional and hedonic needs), or because the lifestyle changes made are156 C .G R E A V E SE TA L .
incongruent with the individual ’s existing beliefs and self-concept. This tension can be modified by a
range of internal and external influences (depicted in the outer circle in Figure 2 ) that may change
over time, such as mood and social interactions. The tension is experienced as an ever present debil-
itating struggle, and tends to draw the individual back to their previous obesogenic lifestyle and so torelapse. However, adoption of a number of approaches and strategies (as outlined above) can help
manage the tension or reduce it (even to the point of resolving it entirely), resulting in successful
weight loss maintenance.
Sensitivity analyses and dissonant cases
All the major synthesis themes are supported by at least four of the included studies (see Table 1 ).
None of the themes were dependent solely on studies with low methodological rigour. However,
two of the studies with low evidence of rigour did add some conceptual richness to the synthesis.
In particular, Haeffele et al. ( 2011 ) suggested that maintenance of weight loss required a number
of cognitive changes, including the development of intrinsic motivation for maintenance behaviours.
Sarlio-Lahteenkorva ( 1998 ) proposed that unfulfilled personal needs and the perceived threat the
new lifestyle posed to self-concept could be triggers for relapse.
With regard to differences in concepts and themes relating to bariatric surgery populations, none
of the major synthesis themes were derived solely from studies in which initial weight loss was due to
bariatric surgery. However, one of the strategies for reducing tension (finding alternative means tomanage stress) was only seen in these studies. In addition, several of our synthesis themes were
not well-represented in the studies with bariatric samples, particularly regarding the strategies of
self-regulation, dealing with external influences, and developing automaticity. The conceptualfocus of these studies was more on the experience of ‘tension ’than its management.
We specifically sought examples of divergent and dissonant findings, and the following individual
accounts appeared to diverge from our derived themes: One participant suggested that maintenancebehaviours could never be automatic (Cioffi, 2002 );‘dieting ’was portrayed in one study both an

abnormal state and a normal part of modern life (Green et al., 2009 ); and negative self-judgements
following lapses were voiced by some successful maintainers (Sarlio-Lähteenkorva, 2000 ). Whilst
success in weight loss maintenance was generally associated with a greater sense of personal
control, one study suggested that ongoing external accountability was also needed in the mainten-
ance phase (Metzgar et al., 2014 ). A majority of studies characterised maintenance as an ongoing
struggle, even for successful maintainers, but two (Haeffele et al., 2011 ; Jallinoja et al., 2008 )
suggested that maintenance can get easier. These examples of apparent dissonance may beaccounted for in our model by different participants having been more or less successful in resolvingthe tension of maintenance.
Discussion
Our synthesis identified a wide range of processes and modifying factors involved in long-termweight management. It also generated a coherent model of weight loss maintenance, which was con-sistent with all the literature examined.
Our synthesis is consistent with quantitative literature on weight loss maintenance. Systematic
reviews of weight loss maintenance interventions (Dombrowski et al., 2014 ; Simpson et al., 2011 )
suggest that self-regulation and problem solving are key skills for maintaining the lifestyle
changes needed for weight loss. A systematic review of quantitative studies testing mediators of
weight loss and maintenance (Teixeira et al., 2015 ) found that intrinsic motivation, positive body
image and self-management skills such as self-monitoring and flexible eating restraint mediated
long-term weight control. Many of the synthesis themes and concepts are also echoed in studies cor-
relating personal attributes and behaviours with success in weight loss maintenance. These includeincreasing insight into influences on behaviour (Colvin & Olson, 1983 ), positive attitudes towards
weight management (Epiphaniou & Ogden, 2010a ), practising self-regulation with flexible levels of
self-restraint (Elfhag & Rossner, 2005 ; Teixeira et al., 2015 ), rapid compensation for and restoration
after lapses (Grilo, Shiffman, & Wing, 1993 ; Wing & Phelan, 2005 ), and the use of physical activity
to help maintain weight loss (Elfhag & Rossner, 2005 ).
Our synthesis is also consistent with prior reviews of qualitative evidence on weight management
(Garip & Yardley, 2011 ; Gupta, 2014 ). In a review of 17 qualitative studies of weight management
(mostly relating to weight loss), Garip and Yardley ( 2011 ) identified several factors associated with
successful weight management that are consistent with our synthesis. These include thoughts andbeliefs about weight management, self-perceptions, self-regulation, social, emotional and environ-
mental influences (including habits and eating to regulate mood or emotional stress). They also
emphasised the role of positive feedback (experiencing benefits from weight loss, and positive/sup-portive experiences of the weight loss programme) as a factor that may provide ongoing motivation.
Gupta ( 2014 ) conducted a thematic analysis of qualitative and quantitative data which included nine
qualitative studies. This identified similar themes to Garip and Yardley ( 2011 ) as well as suggesting a
possible relation between camaraderie in group-based interventions and long-term weight lossmaintenance. Our review adds to these studies by (a) identifying a larger sample of studies, with a
specific focus on weight loss maintenance and (b) synthesising the data into a coherent model ofweight loss maintenance.
Our synthesis is also consistent with a recent review of theories of maintenance of health behav-
iour change (Kwasnicka, Dombrowski, White, & Sniehhota, 2016 ). This identified several major
themes: motivation (including satisfaction and enjoyment of the behaviour, and its congruence
with identity and values), self-regulation, habit development, external influences, and the psychologi-
cal resource costs of maintenance, all of which are represented in our model.
The model we have developed suggests several novel ideas for interventions to support weight
loss maintenance. One approach might be to identify the sources and modifiers of tension for an indi-vidual and use this information to guide personalised interventions. This would require the assess-ment of the psychological and identity-related needs that are currently served by obesogenic158 C .G R E A V E SE TA L .
behaviours, as well as the range of (positive and negative) internal and external factors influencing
the individual ’s behaviour. A personal profile based on this assessment could be used to target inter-
vention strategies.
The idea of encouraging ‘flexible restraint ’when self-monitoring weight or behaviours is consist-
ent with other literature (Benn, Webb, Chang, & Harkin, 2016 ; Ferguson, Brink, Wood, & Koop, 1992 ;
Westenhoefer et al., 2013 ). This implies that interventions should take steps to avoid catastrophic
interpretation of lapses. They should also encourage specific action plans and self-monitoringwhilst avoiding unrealistically rigid rules. For example, this might involve setting a target weightwith an acceptable range (e.g., the weight that I want to maintain is 74 kg and I will take action if
it goes above 75 kg), or specifying changes which incorporate some flexibility (e.g., I will walk the
dog for 10 –20 min every Wednesday evening).
The model also suggests that interventions should aim to help disrupt obesogenic habits and to
establish new habits that support weight control. Theories have been developed to explain the pro-cesses of habit change (Rothman, Sheeran, & Wood, 2009 ; Verplanken, 2006 ), and interventions based
on these are available (Adriaanse, Gollwitzer, De Ridder, de Wit, & Kroese, 2011 ). However, there are
only a few examples of such strategies being used to support weight management (Gardner, Sheals,Wardle, & McGowan, 2014 ; van ’t Riet, Sijtsema, Dagevos, & De Bruijn, 2011 ). Hence further research is
needed to evaluate the effectiveness of habit changing intervention techniques for weight loss
maintenance.
It is not clear whether changes in self-concept are a cause or a consequence of improved main-
tenance. However, their close association suggests that it may be worth evaluating intervention strat-egies to encourage the development of identity-related beliefs that are consistent with energy
balanced lifestyles. It may be feasible, for instance, to facilitate changes in personal and social identitybeliefs, similar to those described in our analysis, such as becoming a healthy person, or being a role
model for others (Wang, Shih, & Carroll, 2015 ).
Although our model suggests that interventions should target the management and resolution of
tension, it also implies that tension could be prevented by making lifestyle changes at the weight lossstage that are less likely to conflict with personal needs or self-concept. For instance, if larger changes
generate higher levels of tension, as the model would suggest, we speculate that making a series ofsmall changes (which nevertheless add up to a substantial change in energy balance) might induce a
more manageable pattern of tension (spread across several domains/contexts/times of day) than a
large context-specific change (such as skipping a meal each day). This idea is currently recommendedby NICE ( 2014 ) guidance on obesity management, based largely on expert opinion. Further research
is needed to assess whether and in what circumstances this approach might be beneficial. Anotheridea for preventing tension would be to check the likely sustainability of behavioural changes at theplanning stage (i.e., aiming to make changes for life rather than the short term). The majority of
weight loss maintenance interventions to date have taken the approach of adding an intervention
at the end of the weight loss phase (Dombrowski et al., 2014 ). However, given that many of the
ideas we have proposed for interventions could also be applied to initial weight loss, it may be pre-
ferable to integrate these weight loss maintenance components within weight loss programmes,
rather than adding them post weight loss.
Strengths, limitations and suggestions for further research
The main strength of our synthesis is the generation of a coherent and parsimonious model that
incorporates and summarises the main themes identified in the included papers, posits relationships
between them, and depicts a process through which they may be addressed. However, the synthesismay be limited by several methodological issues. The literature search may not have been exhaustive,
although we included a wide range of studies from different disciplines with a variety of sample
characteristics and using different methodological approaches. The quality appraisal scheme weused was adapted from published systems but has not been validated, and involved subjectiveHEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW 159
judgements by the researchers. However, the involvement of two researchers in the process provided
some protection against subjective bias. Regarding data saturation, we found that the findings in thelast five papers analysed generated no new major themes. The proposed model is based almost
entirely on retrospective accounts provided at a single time point, so, to some extent the findings
may reflect post hoc rationalisation of events. Hence, there is a need for more prospective longitudi-
nal studies to examine whether changes over time in such variables as insight, automaticity, per-
ceived ‘tension ’and self-concept, are indeed associated with success in maintenance.
Observational, ‘in the moment ’methods such as ecological momentary assessment might also
help to identify such mechanisms in action. Research to identify how unhealthy habits (and theother sources of tension) develop in childhood and the possible role of parenting interactions
might help to identify more preventative intervention strategies. The data were dominated by nar-ratives concerned with managing food intake, so the challenges of maintaining changes in physical
activity were not fully explored, and further research in this area is warranted. It was not possible to
differentiate the views of women and men in the included studies, although the differential impactsof culture and physiology according to gender could produce differences in the dynamics of contex-
tual influences and their management. Finally, the transferability of the data to bariatric surgery
populations may be limited, particularly regarding the strategies of self-regulation, dealing withexternal influences, and developing automaticity. These issues require further study.
Conclusions
This study has created a model of weight loss maintenance that is firmly based on the personal stories
of people who are trying to control their weight. It is, therefore, a credible and relevant resource both
to increase our understanding of their experience and perspectives, and to inform development ofinterventions that can support their efforts.
