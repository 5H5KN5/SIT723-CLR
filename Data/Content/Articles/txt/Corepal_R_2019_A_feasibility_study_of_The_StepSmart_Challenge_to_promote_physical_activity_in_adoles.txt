Abstract
Background: Inactive lifestyles are becoming the norm and creative approaches to encourage adolescents to be
more physically active are needed. Little is known about how gamification techniques can be used in physical
activity interventions for young people. Such approaches may stimulate interest and encourage physical activity
behaviour. The study investigated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a physical activity intervention for
adolescents which included gamification techniques within schools. We tested recruitment and retention strategies
for schools and participants, the use of proposed outcome measures, and explored intervention acceptability.
Methods: This school-based feasibility study of a randomised cluster trial recruited adolescents aged 12 –14 years
(n= 224) from five schools (three intervention; two control) in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The 22-week intervention
(The StepSmart Challenge) informed by self-determination theory and incorporating gamification strategies
involved a school-based pedometer competition. Outcomes, measured at baseline, and post-intervention (at 22
weeks post-baseline and 52 weeks post-baseline) included daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) (measured using ActiGraph accelerometer), mental wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale),
social support for physical activity, time preference (for delayed and larger rewards or immediate and smaller
rewards), pro-social behaviour (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)) and the influence of social networks.
The intervention ’s acceptability was explored in focus groups.
Results: We invited 14 schools to participate; eight showed interest in participating. We recruited the first five who
responded; all five completed the trial. Of the 236 pupils invited, 224 participated (94.9%): 84.8% (190/224) provided
valid MVPA (minutes/day) at baseline and 57.2% (123/215) at 52 weeks. All other outcomes were well completed
apart from the SDQ (65% at baseline). Qualitative data highlighted that participants and teachers found The
StepSmart Challenge to be an acceptable intervention.

Conclusions: The level of interest and high recruitment and retention rates provide support for the feasibility of
this trial. The intervention, incorporating gamification strategies and the recruitment methods, using parental opt-
out procedures, were acceptable to participants and teachers. Teachers also suggested that the implementation of
The StepSmart Challenge could be embedded in a lifelong learning approach to health within the school
curriculum. As young people ’s lives become more intertwined with technology, the use of innovative gamified
interventions could be one approach to engage and motivate health behavioural change in this population.

Background
Despite the clear benefits of physical activity, globally
80% of adolescents fall short of meeting required levels
[48]. In Northern Ireland, only 14% of 11 –16-year-olds
are meeting the target of 60 min of daily MVPA [ 20]. As
physical activity patterns track into adulthood [ 8,58],
adolescence is a crucial period with lifelong effects for
health and habits. One suggested explanation is that ad-
olescents are more present-oriented than adults; they
overemphasise the ‘costs ’of health-related decisions and
discount the value of future benefits [ 22] and, therefore,
can be less likely to engage in health-related behaviours
[33,57]. The use of an engaging intervention using be-
havioural incentives could help initiate physical activity
motivation in more present-orientated individuals by off-
setting the immediate ‘costs ’[56].
Gamification is an emerging area in physical activity
research that incorporates the use of relevant game de-
sign elements in non-gaming contexts [ 13] which can
add fun and enjoyment to physical activity interventions.
Gamification theory suggests that it should be possible
to turn a routine non-game activity such as travel to
school into an engaging and fun game [ 12]. Although
some argue that gamification is just a fad [ 30,62], the
recent success of Pokémon GO illustrates the potential
of gamified interventions for encouraging physical activ-
ity [37] and provides insights into how to engage and
initiate the most inactive people in physical activity in
the short term [ 63]. Additionally, the recent feasibility
testing of gamified interventions using school-based walk-
ing competitions to increase active travel in children and
adolescents shows promise [ 7,23].
Key gamification strategies include using extrinsic (e.g.
incentives) and intrinsic (e.g. perceived enjoyment, in-
creasing skills) motivators, the use of challenges and
competitions and fostering social connectivity [ 50]. There
is emerging evidence that incentives, which are provided
contingent on effort towards the behaviour or successful
performance of the target behaviour [ 38], can be success-
fully incorporated into physical activity interventions tar-
geting adolescents [ 10]. Competitions and challenges haveshown some success in smoking cessation interven-
tions in adolescents [ 26] but there is currently limited
research investigating the effects of competition on phys-
ical activity behaviour change [ 10]. In addition, friendship
networks and the use of peer influencers are associated
with physical activity behaviour in adolescents [ 35,36,51,
53] and may influence physical activity behaviour within
interventions [ 24].
Gamification interventions have rarely been grounded
in well-established theoretical frameworks [ 28,30].
Nonetheless, research has suggested a link between self-
determination theory and gamification concepts, as ex-
emplified by the use of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators,
competition and challenges and social interaction [ 47,
52]. Furthermore, the fact that games can make inter-
ventions more enjoyable aligns with self-determination
theory which postulates that enjoyment is a key aspect
of intrinsic motivation [ 13]. This is reinforced by Best
et al. [ 1] who used survey data to investigate correlates
of daily physical activity behaviour in children and ado-
lescents and found fun and enjoyment to be predictors
of physical activity.
Although schools appear to be a suitable location in
which to deliver physical activity interventions [ 3,14,
25], there is a need for more high-quality studies, with
process evaluation to understand whether the interven-
tion itself is ineffective or how contextual factors might
influence this [ 31,39].
This study investigated the feasibility of implementing
and evaluating a school-based gamified pedometer com-
petition designed to promote physical activity among
12–14-year-olds, known as ‘The StepSmart Challenge ’
(trial number: NCT02455986), which integrates core
gamification strategies with self-determination theory. A
previous publication details the participants ’experiences
of The StepSmart Challenge, in particular the compe-
tition formats and use of incentives [ 9] which ap-
peared to encourage most participants. Participants
wore Fitbit Zip pedometers, which appeared to be im-
portant for self-directed goal setting, monitoring and
immediate feedback.Corepal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:132 Page 2 of 15
The specific aims of the feasibility study were to
1. Test recruitment strategie s for schools and adolescents;
2. Determine retention rates for schools and adolescents;
3. Assess the appropriateness of proposed outcome
measures based on completion rates, missing data
and proportion of valid data provided; and
4. Explore the intervention ’s acceptability and possible
refinements to improve its design.
Methods
Study design
The present study was a two-arm parallel feasibility clus-
ter randomised controlled trial comparing ‘The StepS-
mart Challenge ’and a no-intervention control arm. Five
post-primary schools from Belfast, Northern Ireland
were recruited. Randomisation took place at the school
level, with three schools randomised to the intervention
and two schools to the control. The intervention took
place from April 2015 to September 2015. Ethical ap-
proval was granted by the School of Medicine, Dentistry
and Biomedical Science Research Ethics Committee
(Queen ’s University, Belfast) (Ref: 15.09).
Recruitment of schools
Schools
The sample consisted of post-primary schools in Belfast.
For pragmatic reasons, we choose to select our sample
from a list of schools which had previously participated in
research projects with QUB and were therefore familiar
with the time and processes involved. We sent letters of in-
vitation to participate in the trial to a purposive sample of
14 of these schools and made follow-up phone calls to the
school principal to explain the purpose of the study. We
aimed to invite a mix of schools from affluent and deprived
areas (using free school meal eligibility as a proxy meas-
ure), and of single-sex and co-educational schools (using
public information [ 15]). Only the first five schools to
accept the invitation were recruited due to the scope of the
study and the resources available. A stratified randomisa-
tion process (stratified by socio-economic status, and
whether schools were single-sex or co-educational) was
undertaken by an independent statistician to assign schools
to the intervention or control group using software avail-
able at http://www.randomization.com .A st h er a n d o m i s a -
tion was undertaken to assess the feasibility of the
randomisation process, all school characteristics were in-
cluded despite the small number of participating schools.
Randomisation resulted in thr ee schools allocated to the
intervention group, and two schools to the control group.
Participants
Schools were asked to identify ear 9 classes (12 –14-year-
olds) to participate, aiming to recruit up to 50 adolescentswithin each school. No formal criteria were applied to
class selection; however, we asked teaching staff to recruit
classes that were representative of the wider school popu-
lation in relation to academic ability, gender (if relevant)
and perceived physical activity behaviour. We believe the
class teachers were well placed to have knowledge regard-
ing perceived physical activity levels, based on, for ex-
ample, whether adolescents were involved in sports teams
or not. Input from teaching staff was important as they
were best placed to assess any potential conflicts that may
have impacted upon the team component of The StepS-
mart Challenge.
Following class selection, the research team organised
an information session in each school to provide
teachers and the selected classes with more details about
the study and an opportunity to ask questions. Informa-
tion sheets, consent forms and parental/guardian opt-
out consent forms were provided to adolescents to read
and take home to parents/guardians, to allow them time
to assimilate the information and make an informed
decision. If adolescents wished to take part, they were
asked to provide written consent. Adolescents were
excluded from the study if (a) their parents informed the
school that the adolescent had been advised by their
general practitioner not to undertake moderate physical
activity, (b) they were not in Year 9, and (c) they had not
provided assent or if their parents had completed the
parental opt-out written consent form.
Intervention
The StepSmart Challenge used gamification strategies,
combined with the core tenets of self-determination the-
ory, to encourage and support physical activity behav-
iour change by moving participants along the motivation
continuum (from more external forms of motivation,
e.g. external regulation) towards intrinsic motivation
(e.g. identified regulation) [ 46], as shown in the interven-
tion logic model (Fig. 1). Researchers visited each inter-
vention school at baseline to collect outcome measures.
It was during this time that researchers reiterated (pro-
vided initially during the information session) the spe-
cific details about what the intervention involved, e.g.
explanations were provided about the competition
elements, the material and social incentives and The
StepSmart Challenge website.
The StepSmart Challenge consisted of two distinct
phases (Table 1shows key intervention components and
potential mechanisms). In summary, phase 1 (8 weeks)
comprised of competitions on three levels: inter-school,
between the three intervention schools; within-school,
team-based; and within-school, individual. This phase
used a range of material and social incentives to pro-
mote physical activity. For the inter-school competition,
Fitbit Zip data collected from the three interventionCorepal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:132 Page 3 of 15
schools was collated to produce an aggregate score for
each school. Teachers informed participants on the pro-
gress of their school on a weekly basis. This information
was also available to participants via The StepSmart
Challenge website. At the end of phase 1, the interven-
tion school with the highest number of aggregate steps
was awarded a £1000 prize. The within-school team-
based competition ran alongside the inter-school compe-
tition and involved approximately 10 teams within each
school (four to five adolescents within each team). The
selection of teams took current physical activity levels
and friendship networks into account (obtained from
baseline outcome assessments), to ensure that each team
included participants with a range of physical activity
levels and at least one friend. The aggregate step count
of each team was updated weekly on The StepSmart
Challenge website leader board. The team with the high-
est number of aggregate steps within each school at the
end of phase 1 were the winners. The team competition
was comprised of social incentives such as the publica-
tion of results on The StepSmart Challenge website and
a trophy which was awarded to the leading team in each
school at the end of the competition. The within-school
individual competition ran alongside the inter-school,
and within-school team-based competitions. Each week,
participants within each school competed to be the
‘walker of the week ’(the participant that had accumulated
the most steps in the week) or the ‘most improved ’partici-
pant (the participant that had increased their step count
the most from the previous week). The two weekly win-
ners in each school would receive material incentives suchas selfie sticks and vouchers (approximate value of £10)
and a social incentive (a certificate of achievement).
Phase 2 (14 weeks) began immediately after phase 1
ended and consisted of a within-school individual ped-
ometer competition. Participants were encouraged to
complete weekly challenges to increase their steps via
The StepSmart Challenge website. Other missions encour-
aged participants to go walking with friends and family.
This encouraged pro-social behaviour among participants
in relation to physical activity outside of a school and the
team-based competition format. Phase 2 represented a
tapered withdrawal from the extrinsically motivated be-
haviour change techniques towards more intrinsically mo-
tivated behaviours. Instead of weekly prizes, the three
highest performing participants in each school were each
presented with a trophy and a ‘goody bag ’(approximate
value of £30, consisting of an assortment of material in-
centives used in phase 1). Other incentives were more ab-
stract and took the form of ‘virtual badges ’to represent
their achievements; this could be viewed on a participant ’s
personal profile on The StepSmart Challenge website. Be-
fore the start of phase 2, participants were invited to join a
closed Facebook group. This provided participants with a
convenient way to contact research staff an opportunity to
share their progress and a platform for research staff to
suggest different types of physical activity and provide
motivational messages.
Control
Control participants did not receive any form of inter-
vention. The participants were not provided with Fitbit

Competition The participating classes from the three
intervention schools joined a pedometer
competition using Fitbit Zip pedometers.
Phase 1 (8 weeks)
Inter-school pedometer competition
Fitbit Zip pedometer data collected across all three
intervention schools was collated to produce an
aggregate school score. Teachers informed the
participants on the progress of their school on a
weekly basis. This information was also available to
participants via The StepSmart Challenge website.
Within schools team competition
The team competition ran alongside the main
school competition and involved approximately 10
teams within each school (five adolescents within
each team). The highest placed team within each
school at the end of phase 1 were the winners.
Within schools individual competition
Each week, all participants within each school
competed to be the ‘walker of the week ’(the
participant that had accumulated the most steps in
the week) or the ‘most improved ’participant (the
participant that had increased their step count the
most from the previous week).
Phase 2
Within schools individual competition
Phase 2 began immediately after phase 1 ended.
The inter-school and team competitions were re-
placed with an individual level competition within
each school using the Fitbit Zip pedometers. The
individual pedometer competition awarded the
three participants in each school who had accumu-
lated the most steps during this phase.
Participants were encouraged to complete weekly
challenges to increase their steps via The StepSmart
Challenge website in this phase (e.g. ‘your weekly
mission (should you choose to accept it) will be to
walk or run the length of your street at least once
every day ’). Other missions encouraged participants
to go walking with friends and family. This
encouraged pro-social behaviour among partici-
pants in relation to physical activity outside of a
school and team-based competition format.The use of competition and challenges has been
suggested as a way of making a physical activity
intervention more engaging and enjoyable, which
in turn can help maintain continued participation
([13][64];).
Team working and social networks (e.g.
working in teams for the intra-school
competition and inter-school
competition)Selection of teams took current physical activity
levels and friendship networks (using the social
network data collected at baseline) into account, to
ensure that each team (4 –5 participants) included
participants with a range of physical activity levels
and at least one nominated friend.The effect of peers on influencing physical activity
in adolescents has been established ([ 17][51];).
Behavioural economics suggests this can be
harnessed to counteract low levels of self-control
[60]. Teams can also provide an opportunity for
peer recognition which may increase feelings of
self-competence, enjoyment and likelihood of
maintained participation ([ 6][34];).
Workbooks A short workbook was given to participants at the
start of the intervention. This included ‘fun-facts ’,
tips and challenges to promote physical activity
behaviour individually and as part of a team. There
was also as a section for the participant to record
weekly step target (individual and team).Self-determination theory proposes that a sense of
relatedness with (the belonging to a group) is a
fundamental psychological need for motivation
[46]. This can also further foster a sense of
connectedness to the team and thus team
members could help encourage each other to
increase physical activity levels.
Behavioural incentives Phase 1 (8 weeks)
Inter-school pedometer competition
£1000 prize was awarded to the school with the
highest aggregated number of steps at the end of
the phase.
Within schools team competition
The team competition was comprised of social
incentives such as the publication of results on The
StepSmart Challenge website, and a trophy whichBehavioural incentives contingent on successful
performance of a behaviour provide positive
reinforcement that can increase the frequency of
the behaviour [ 54]. Behavioural incentives may also
work to initiate physical activity in participants with
low motivation due to present orientation and high
levels of impulsivity [ 44].Corepal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:132 Page 5 of 15
Zip pedometers, and they did not take part in the
competitions and did not receive material or social in-
centives during the intervention period. Control partici-
pants were asked to complete the same outcome
assessments as the intervention group at each time
point. Control group schools were each given £400 to
cover the cost of staff time associated with participa-
tion in the study.Outcome measures
Recruitment and retention
The numbers of schools and adolescents who were
invited to participate and consented were recorded at T0
(baseline). The numbers of schools and participants who
withdrew, were lost to follow up and retained were
recorded post-intervention, at 22 weeks (T1) and T2
(52 weeks).Table 1 The StepSmart Challenge key intervention components and potential mechanisms (Continued)
Component Activity/task Potential mechanisms
was awarded to the leading team in each school at
the end of the competition.
Within schools individual competition
The weekly ‘walker of the week ’and ‘most
improved ’received a certificate, and a prize which
varied over the course of the competition (e.g.
selfie sticks, cinema tickets, gift certificates).
Phase 2 (14 weeks)
Within schools individual competition
Phase 2 represented a tapered withdrawal from the
extrinsically motivated behaviour change
techniques towards more intrinsically motivated
behaviours. Instead of weekly prizes, the three
highest performing participants in each school
were each presented with a trophy and a ‘goody
bag ’comprising of an assortment of material
incentives, e.g. selfie sticks, £10 vouchers.
Other incentives were more abstract and took the
form of ‘virtual badges ’to represent their
achievements; this could be viewed on a
participant ’s personal profile on The StepSmart
Challenge website.
Fitbit Zip pedometers Participants were given a Fitbit Zip pedometer and
asked to wear it every day of the intervention
(phase 1 and phase 2). Fitbit Zips provided
participants feedback on daily steps, and step data
were uploaded to the study website via the Fitbit
mobile application or a wireless dongle located at
designated areas within schools.Previous research using pedometers have shown
success in increasing children and adolescents
physical activity [ 32]. Pedometers provide real-time
feedback. This continual feedback allows individuals
to self-regulate behaviour by self-monitoring phys-
ical activity [ 45].
Regular feedback can provide positive feedback
and instil feelings of competence when meaningful
achievements are reached e.g. self-directed goals
[46]. Regular feedback and opportunities to self-
monitor behaviour can also counteract low motiv-
ation by keeping the activity salient [ 34].
The StepSmart Challenge website Fitbit Zip data were uploaded to The StepSmart
Challenge website and participants could review
their daily/weekly scores and view the competition
leader board. The website included the provision of
motivational messages, weekly challenges and links
to other physical activity resources.The website provides regular feedback that shows
participants their own physical activity in relation to
the physical activity achieved by peers. This
feedback might help keep the activity salient and
motivate participants to increase their physical
activity to normative levels (relative to the group)
[64].
Facebook group The Facebook group was created to provide
support during the summer months (phase 2). This
was a closed group, which was accessible to only
The StepSmart Challenge participants from all three
intervention schools. As a further protective
measure teaching staff could view and moderate all
communication via Facebook. This group provided
participants with a convenient way to contact
research staff, an opportunity to share their
progress, and a platform for research staff to
suggest different types of physical activity and
provide motivational messages.Facebook is a popular social network site among
adolescents. Utilising this platform provides an
opportunity for researchers to support and engage
with participants, and participants to engage with
each other during the summer months. This group
was also used so researchers could post different
opportunities to increase physical activity in the
local area, and for participants to share their
physical activity achievements.Corepal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:132 Page 6 of 15
Proposed outcome measures
Minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) were measured using validated ActiGraph GT3X/
GT3X+ accelerometers (ActiGraph Inc., USA). Accelerom-
eters were provided to participants at T0, T1 and T2 to
wear for 7 consecutive days and to only remove it when
bathing, swimming or sleeping. Activity counts using the
accelerometers were recorded in 1 s epochs. In order to
obtain total minutes of MVPA per day, the data were
reintegrated in 60 s epochs before Evenson cut off points
were applied to the data [ 16]. Non-wear time was defined
as a run of zero counts lasting more than 60 min [ 5]. Valid
data were defined as (a) a minimum of 8 h/day wear-time
and (b) for at least 3 days [ 2,27]. At each time point, par-
ticipants at each school completed paper-based question-
naires in their respective classrooms. The questionnaires
included the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale
(WEMWBS) [ 59], perceived social support for physical ac-
tivity [ 49], social networks [ 19]a n daf u t u r eo r i e n t a t i o n
scale to measure time preferences [ 42]. Class teachers
completed the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ) at their desk for each participant in their classroom,
while participants were completing the paper-based ques-
tionnaires that they were provided. The SDQ is used to as-
sess emotional and behavioural problems and pro-social
behaviour [ 18].
Outcome measures were administered by members of
the research team (RC, PB, RON, MT and RH) during
agreed scheduled classes on the school premises. Teachers
completed a Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire for
each participating pupil in their class while the pupils were
completing their questionnaires. To explore the accept-
ability of the intervention and study design, focus groups
were conducted at all the above time points and at the
end of phase 1(8 weeks post-baseline) (Table 2).
Intervention acceptability
Repeated semi-structured focus groups were conducted
with a subsample of adolescent participants in each school.
The same participants were invited at each focus group.
Participants were recruited using purposive sampling in
consultation with teaching staff. Teachers identified poten-
tial participants with a range of physical activity levels (low
to high) as well as mixed educational ability. Three focus
groups were conducted in each intervention school (at T0,
T1 and T2), and two focus groups were conducted in each
control school (at T0 and T2). Participants ( n= 33) were
recruited using purposive sampling in consultation with
teaching staff. Teachers identified potential participants
with a range of physical activity levels (low to high) as well
as mixed educational ability. The same participants were
invited at each focus group; however, the number of par-
ticipants varied due to school absences (mean of 6 partici-
pants; range 2 –7 participants). No participants refused totake part or dropped out of the focus group discussions.
Focus groups were conducted by PB, RC and RO ’N. RC
was present at all focus groups, and either PB or RO ’N
supported RC by taking field notes at each session. The
focus groups lasted on average 33 min (range 21 –41 min)
and were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The
topic guide was refined iteratively following interim ana-
lysis at each data collection point. Additional file 1details
the topic guide for the focus groups.
At T2, a focus group was also conducted with three
teachers from intervention schools. This focus group
was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Analyses
Proportions were used to describe the recruitment rates
(for schools and participants) and the retention rates at
T1 and T2. Descriptive analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version
22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Due to the non-normal
distribution of the accelerometer data, median and inter-
quartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for these outcomes.
Accelerometer data were processed using ActiLife version
6.13.1 (ActiGraph Inc., USA). Imputation analysis using
last observation carried forward (LOCF) was conducted to
treat missing data [ 21] for the accelerometer data. Out-
come data from WEMWBS and SDQ were normally dis-
tributed and were therefore presented as mean and
standard deviation (SD). All other outcomes were non-
normally distributed and presented as median and IQR.
Exploratory analysis was conducted on the association
between friendship within teams and physical activity,
using R version 3.3.2. Accelerometer data were processed
using the ActiGraph software package version 1.0.1 [ 11].
Feasibility studies are not designed to investigate the
effectiveness of interventions [ 29]. Thus, no significance
testing was conducted.
Intervention acceptability
All focus group transcripts were imported into NVivo
(Version 10, QSR, Southport, UK) to manage and sup-
port analysis using the thematic analysis framework [ 4].
Initially, researchers (RC and PB) familiarised themselves
with the data. RC and PB developed a sample coding
frame independently and this was refined iteratively with
subsequent discussions. Anonymised illustrative quotes
supporting emerging themes were highlighted and
agreed by researchers.

before a follow-up phone call was made by a member of
the research team. In total, 11/14 schools responded: 8
were interested in participating and we recruited the first
5 of these respondents. Three other respondentsdeclined to take part for the following reasons: (1)
already committed to other research projects, (2) staff
pressures and (3) timetabling issues. Baseline character-
istics of participating schools are shown in Table 3. Most

participating schools were single-sex schools. Three
schools had high levels of free school meal eligibility
(> 37.5%). Of the 236 students who were invited to
participate, 224 (94.9%) provided written consent.
Aim 3: to assess feasibility of using the proposed
outcome measures
At T0, 214/224 (95.5%) participants returned accelerom-
eters, of which 190/224 (84.8%) of participants returned
valid data for minutes/day of MVPA (Additional file 2
shows data by school). At T2, 198/214 (92.5%) partici-
pants returned accelerometers; 123/214 (57.4%) returned
valid data for analysis. Overall, almost half, 21/44 (47%),
of the unreturned devices were attributed to school A.
School A was assigned to the control group and was
based in an area of high disadvantage. Table 4shows the
completion rates for all proposed outcomes. The com-
pletion of WEMWBS ranged from 213/224 (95.0%) at
T0 to 195/224 (87.0%) at T2. Response rates for SDQs
from teachers were low (65%) during T0 due to staff
absence within one school.
Table 4shows the potential for change using the pro-
posed outcomes (for the social network analysis, see
Additional file 2). Daily minutes of MVPA (our proposed
primary outcome) for the intervention group remained
unchanged from baseline at T1 and T2. In the control
group, there was a slight increase from baseline in
MVPA at T1 (47.4 min/day; IQR 32.7 to 65.1), which de-
creased closer to baseline levels at T2 (37.2 min/day;
IQR 26.5 to 53.1). The data from all other outcomes
remained relatively stable at each point.
At each time point, between two and six researchers
facilitated data collection in each school depending on
staff availability, with PB, RC or R ’ON present on every
occasion to lead the collection process. Data collection
in each school would occur at a prearranged time and
day with the majority of participant questionnaire data
collected at this time. On occasion, it would be necessary
to return to schools to collect questionnaire data for par-
ticipants who were absent during the data collection ses-
sion. During the data collection sessions, teachers were
provided with the SDQ ’s to complete. However, it was notalways possible for teachers to complete these during the
time researchers were present in the school. In such cases,
a researcher would return to the school to collect the
SDQ ’s a short time after the data collection visit. At each
data collection period, researchers were often required to
visit each school multiple times to collect accelerometers
due to participant absences, participants forgetting to
bring them into school or having misplaced the acceler-
ometers. At each time point, accelerometer data was
downloaded and processed by one researcher. Accelerom-
eter data was downloaded and processed at each time
point in batches (by school), and it would take approxi-
mately an half a day to complete the process for each
school. At each time point, two researchers were involved
in pedometer data collection and analysis.
Aim 4: to explore intervention acceptability and identify
any refinements that could be made to The StepSmart
Challenge
Our focus group findings are reported under three main
themes: participant acceptability of the intervention,
teachers ’perception of relevance of intervention and key
implementation findings in The StepSmart Challenge.
Participant acceptability of key intervention components
Generally, participants spoke positively regarding taking
part in The StepSmart Challenge. In particular, the com-
petition format and incentives on the offer appeared to
encourage participation, ‘Every week cos you know it ’s
like running out of time for like the prizes, [and I] just
really want to get one ’(school C, male, T1). However,
for some, the competitive nature of the intervention ap-
peared to be viewed as ‘off putting ’as one participant
noted, ‘It’s just sort of cause you knew you probably
were not going to win so you are just like there ’s really
no point in wearing [the FitBit Zip pedometer] ’(school
E, female, T2). This was despite the presence of a weekly
prize for the ‘most improved ’participant.
Team-based competition appeared to be an acceptable
approach to encouraging physical activity among partici-
pants with qualitative data suggesting a significant role
played by peer networks, both in terms of pro-socialTable 3 Characteristics of participating schools

of interventions [ 29]. Thus, no significance testing was conductedCorepal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:132 Page 11 of 15
behaviour ‘when you have your friend with you …you’d
be more encouraged to do more walking ’(female, school
D) and goal setting ‘you’re just trying to beat your friends ’
(male, school C, T1). However, team-based competition
was not without its caveats. While some participants
highlighted its benefits, ‘if they [team mates] want to go
for a run you will want to go for a run with them ’(school
C, male, T0), there were some issues in relation to the
compositions of teams. Girls, in particular, showed a pref-
erence for team(s) based on current friendship networks
rather than on a mix of ability in relation to PA; ‘It would
have been easier if we were with our friends ’(school D, fe-
male, T1) and if ‘you don ’tl i k ep e o p l ei ny o u rt e a my o u ’re
just going to be like …[I’m] not even going to talk to you ’
(school E, female, T2).
Participants ’comments indicated that they did not
use The StepSmart Challenge website regularly and
many preferred using the Fitbit mobile application or
the display on the Fitbit Zip to track scores; ‘Ij u s t
didn ’t think there was any point cause like you could
see it on the pedometer ’(school D, female, T2) and ‘I
think loads of people used the app [Fitbit] much
more. Some people probably didn ’te v e ng oo n t ot h e
website ’(school D, female, T2). Pupils appeared to
engage less with the workbook, preferring to use the
Fitbit application instead.
Teachers ’perceptions of relevance of intervention
The gender component of the competition was reflected
upon within teacher interviews; ‘Boys probably wanted it
more for the competition element …their friendship
groups at our place [school] are pretty much made up
with who they play sport with. Sport ’s a massive social
thing in our place [school] as well. So, they want to beat
their mate, not be in a group with them ’(school C,
teacher 1). While teachers representing the girls ’schools
stated that they were grateful to be involved in this type
of study, they acknowledged the number of girls who
regularly engage in sport was relatively minor: ‘What we
were finding at our sports days was the usual girls were
winning everything ’(school D, teacher 1).
Teachers suggested that the incentives were important
to encourage engagement but felt that the value of prizes
could be reduced in favour of being able to offer them
more often; ‘Scaling down maybe the prizes to make
more prizes but at a lesser value …this is not to be nasty
to children, but they ’ll be impressed by nearly anything. ’
(school C, teacher 1). Moreover, providing incentives for
reaching a certain level was also suggested, ‘[If] they have
reached that level …then you ’re rewarding more children
than just the one, [they] deserve a reward ’(school C,
teacher 2). Teachers suggested that while the workbook
was useful, it felt too much like homework to pupils, ‘I
think they were easy enough to use …[but] they see thatas work; they don ’t see that as that ’s just a sheet or a book,
no, it ’sw o r k ’(school C, teacher 1).
The StepSmart Challenge also appeared to go beyond
physical health and physical activity and was thought of
more as a ‘wellbeing ’or‘social ’intervention by teachers.
As one teacher noted, ‘Some of it could be maths, art or
whatever, but it ’s that sort of feeling of group together-
ness …whether it ’s well-being mentally or well-being
physically, [can have] an impact on them ’(school C,
teacher 1). This view was supported within another school:
‘I think yours [StepSmart] has provided a starting point for
us…that we can take it forward and look at the whole
physical and mental health of pupils ’(school E, teacher 2).
Future implementation
Several participants suggested that wrist-worn devices
for monitoring physical activity could reduce loss and
increase wear time; ‘I think …you can get those [pedome-
ters] in your wrists but they are more expensive and
maybe a lot better like but for people our age …it’s like a
lot like getting changed after the shower etc. so we al-
ways forgot to like put it on. ’(school C, male, T2). This
preference for wrist-worn devices may also extend to the
wearing of accelerometers for measuring physical activ-
ity;‘Something else maybe that you can just put on your
wrist might be a little bit easier ’(school D, female, T1)
and ‘It’s the fact that you could see it like with a crop
top [when] you ’re walking ’(school E, female, T2).
Further, it was suggested that The StepSmart Chal-
lenge may be expanded to other subjects out with Phys-
ical Education (P.E.), ‘It worked very well in the P.E.
department, but I can see how it can lend itself to other
departments in relation to whether it ’s the maths depart-
ment, the science department, which would be good ’
(school E, teacher 1).
Regarding implementation, it was noted that parental
opt-out consent was a particularly valuable and wel-
comed approach, ‘Opt out I find, when you ’re dealing
with children and parents, is always better ’(school A,
teacher 2) and ‘It’s [parental opt-out] easier because they
don’t have to sign anything ’(school B, teacher 1).
Teachers felt this significantly reduced their administra-
tion burden and the task of ‘chasing up ’outstanding par-
ental consent forms.
Discussion
Our findings suggest that The StepSmart Challenge, a
gamified physical activity intervention, is acceptable to
adolescents aged 12 –14 years. Recruitment and retention
rates of schools and participants indicate that it is feas-
ible to scale up the intervention for an effectiveness trial.
In general, the questionnaires were well understood and
completed at each time point and were deemed appro-
priate for use in a future study. However, The StepSmartCorepal et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2019) 5:132 Page 12 of 15
Challenge would benefit from the refinement of the
website used and participant workbooks, and there is a
need to explore how to maximise the return of valid ac-
celerometer data from participants, as well as question-
naire data from teachers.
Participant recruitment and retention was high in both
the intervention and control groups. A contributing fac-
tor to participant recruitment was the use of parental
opt-out consent. Tigges [ 61] noted an increase of ap-
proximately one third when choosing passive (opt-out)
as opposed to active (opt-in) parental consent. Extensive
discussions took place with the schools regarding the
process of parental opt-out consent, but we recognise
that this may depend on the nature of the intervention.
It has also been suggested that passive consent is more
inclusive of those less engaged within the school system
or those from ethnic minority backgrounds [ 61]. A limita-
tion of opt-out consent was not having the contact details
of parents or participants in order to send reminders or
prompt wearing of accelerometers. This disadvantage in
using opt-out consent has also been shown in previous
research by [ 8].
Approaches to improve the return of accelerometer
data require further consideration before scaling up for a
full trial. Difficulties were encountered within one of the
control boys schools which accounted for 11/35 (31.4%)
of accelerometers not returned and of those who
returned only 9/24 (37.5%) provided valid data. A range
of additional efforts was made to try to improve reten-
tion rates and the return of devices, such as additional
visits to the schools by the research team, letters sent to
parents from the school principal and offering vouchers
for the return of devices. Participants in the control
schools did not receive any intervention nor were they
on a waiting list to receive the intervention. Therefore,
participants may not have felt particularly incentivised to
complete the outcome measures. Future research could
explore the use of wrist-worn accelerometers or increas-
ing the value of vouchers provided on return of acceler-
ometers. Many post-primary schools have adopted a text
messaging service to relay information to parents. Utilis-
ing this system to deliver prompts could be one way to
improve participant wear time and the return of acceler-
ometers but would inevitably impose further burden on
the schools.
Research by Hunter et al. [ 23] suggests that competi-
tion may extrinsically motivate and encourage physical
activity behaviour among school children. The findings
from our qualitative data reported in a previous publica-
tion [ 9] highlighted that participants felt competition
could provide a sense of enjoyment, feelings of compe-
tence and wellbeing which is consistent with the self-
determination theory. Building on this, teacher focus
groups proposed the benefit of changing the incentivestructure in the competition which would allow more
participants to be rewarded. This positive feedback
might increase engagement in participants and encour-
age long-term physical activity behaviour change. Imple-
menting The StepSmart Challenge as part of a health
promotion programme embedded in the school curricu-
lum could be a method to add the physical activity edu-
cation and knowledge acquisition elements of The
StepSmart Challenge without increasing the burden on
teachers [ 41]. This holistic approach to The StepSmart
Challenge was supported by teachers who felt that a life-
long learning approach to The StepSmart Challenge
would be needed and to get the buy-in from senior staff
in school [ 43].
A novel aspect of this school-based study was the pur-
poseful effort to continue the study across the summer
months. This was made possible by The StepSmart Chal-
lenge website and Fitbit application, through which partic-
ipants could track and monitor their progress, as well as
complete challenges and receive virtual reward badges
(phase 2). Continuation over the summer holidays was
viewed as important to try and maintain healthy physical
activity habits outside of the school context. The accessi-
bility of the application (via mobile phones) appeared to
be preferable to using the study website and qualitative
data suggested that most participants who were actively
engaged in the study uploaded pedometer data via the
Fitbit application.
Conclusions
As young people ’s lives become more intertwined with
technology, the use of innovative gamified interventions
could be one approach to engage and motivate behav-
ioural change in this population. Results from this feasi-
bility study have provided support for the acceptability
of an intervention that incorporates such approaches. The
study also demonstrated the suitability of the proposed
school and participant recruitment methods and using
parental opt-out procedures. Further thought must be
given to how we boost accelerometer retention in future
studies and how the intervention can be embedded within
the school curriculum. Incorporating process evaluations
and qualitative research in future research would add fur-
ther depth to our understanding of outcome evaluations
and provide insight into the intervention ’se x t e r n a lv a l i d i t y
which is necessary before decisions are made to scale up
public health interventions.
