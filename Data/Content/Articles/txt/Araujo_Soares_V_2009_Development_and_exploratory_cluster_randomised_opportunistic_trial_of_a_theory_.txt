Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 2 - 
Abstract  
This paper reports the development and exploratory test of a school -based intervention 
programme designed to enhance levels of physical activity in adolescents.  The intervention is 
based on social cognitive theory (SCT), self -regulation theory (SRT) and planning as 
evidence -based mediators of physical activity changes. Two classes, paired on social -
economic variables, were selected from each of eight Portuguese schools and randomly assigned to an intervention or control group (N=291). Primary outcome was ‘mode rate to 
vigorous physical activity ’ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire ) measured  pre and 
post intervention and at three and nine months follow -ups. SCT, SRT and planning variables 
were secondary outcomes measured pre and post intervention. At post test, participants in the intervention group reported 18 minutes per week more 
physical activity (PA) , adjusted  for pre -intervention, age and sex , than those in the  control 
group (95% confidence interval - 10 to 46; p = .249). This difference increased  to 33 minutes 
(95% CI – 4 to 71; p = . 082) at three months and to 57 minutes (95% CI 13 to 101, p= .008) at 
nine month follow -up. Moreover, the intervention resulted in changes of some of the 
theoretical target variables, including outcome expectancies an d coping planning . However, 
no evidence was found for the changes in theoretical moderators to mediate the intervention effects on behaviour . Implications for theory and for future research are discussed.

Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 3 - 
 A lack of physical activity (PA) is prevalent amongst adolescents (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 1997; Varo, et al., 2003) and contributes to a tremendous health 
burden of obesi ty, type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases in adolescence and over the 
lifespan (Mokdad et al.,  2004; Ogden, Flegal, Carroll & Johnston, 2002; Ruiz et al., 2006). 
Effective interventions to increase (PA) are needed to prevent disease in adolescence and  the 
early development of sedentary lifestyle ( Hallal et al., 2006; Marcus et al., 2000).  
Previous PA interventions were weakly effective  (Dishman & Buckworth, 1996; Kahn 
et al., 2002; Stone, McKenzie, Welk, & Booth, 1998) and maintenance of effects has been 
poor (Biddle, Gorely & Stensel, 2004). The majority of previous trials have been based in the United States and little evidence about behaviour change in European adolescents is available (Marcus et al., 2006). Many programs have failed to utilize evidence- based theory to identify 
key determinants of behaviour change as targets for interventions (Baranowski, Anderson & Carmack, 1998; Dishman, et al., 2004; Marcus et al., 2000). Interventions addressing evidence -supported mediators of behaviour change ar e more likely to be effective as they 
build upon accumulative research. Moreover, applications of theory -based interventions 
present an opportunity to test if an intervention successfully modifies the hypothesised determinants and if these changes mediate behaviour change effects (Baranowski, et al., 1998; Michie & Abraham, 2004). The present paper introduces the development and preliminary test of a theory -based intervention based on social cognitive theory, self -regulation theory and 
planning designed to enhance PA in adolescents.  
Social Cognitive Theory  
Social cognitive theory (SCT ; Bandura, 1997) assumes that behaviour is guided by 
beliefs that people acquire in their ongoing interaction with the environment; in particular beliefs about the consequences of behaviour and individual capabilities. In line with other social -cognition theories, outcome expectancies, self -efficacy and goals are conceptualised as 
proximal causal determinants of behaviour change (Bandura, 1997; Fishbein et al., 1991). 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 4 - 
Individuals  are more likely set a goal to change their course of action and adopt a new 
behaviour if this new behaviour is expected to result in  more favourable outcomes (action 
outcome expectancies) than previous behaviour (situation outcome expectancies) and if the y 
feel capable of performing the new behaviour (self -efficacy).  A particular strength of SCT is 
that it theorises about both, the determinants of behaviour change and the factors determining 
changes in social cognitions, such as mastery experience, vicario us experience, persuasion 
and physiological feedback (Bandura, 1997). Numerous successful applications of SCT to PA (Dishman et al., 2004; Stone et al., 1998; Winters, Petrosa & Charlton, 2003) and other health behaviours (Holden, Moncher, Schinke, 1990; S chwarzer & Luszczynska, 2006) provide 
evidence that SCT offers a sound background for PA interventions for adolescents.  
Favourable social cognitions and action goals are necessary precursors for behaviour 
change, but  they do not guarantee action. People m ay fail to implement their intentions or to 
cope with self -regulatory problems . Recent research has suggested that post -decisional 
processes of goal pursuit play an important role in translating intentions into behaviour (Abraham, Sheeran & Johnston, 1998;  Gollwitzer, 1999; Schwarzer, 2001).  
Self-Regulation Theory  
Self-regulation theory emphasises self -monitoring and ongoing comparisons of current 
behaviour against individual standards  in order to reduce discrepancies (e.g., Carver & 
Scheier, 1998; Kanfer & Goldstein, 1991). P rompting self -monitoring ha s been shown to be 
effective in behaviour modification (Bandura & Cervone, 1983: Lorig, et al., 1999). Moreover, exercising regular self -control improve s self-regulatory capacity (Muraven, 
Baumeister & Tice, 1999). Goal setting and self -monitoring have been key components in 
many successful health promotion programmes for adolescents (Sallis et al, 1997; Stone et al, 1998; Tell & Vellar, 1987). 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 5 - 
If-then Plans in Self -regulation  
There is compelling evidence that advance planning of the when, where, and how of 
goal pursuit facilitates the realization of intentions (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). If -then 
planning involves defining  the means one will utilise to reach their goals. In SCT, this might 
be described as a graded hierarchical process of goal setting. Defining means -end 
relationships may guide individual self -regulation in reducing discrepancies between current 
behaviour and personal standards (Sniehotta, Scholz & Schwarzer, 2005). Moreover, the 
prospective i f-then link (or implementation intention ) leads to a cognitive representation that 
enhances the accessibility of specified cues and allows for swift and effortless initiation of the 
respective goal -directed responses (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).  
Action P lanning refers to the specification of when, where and how to act in 
accordance with one’s intention. Coping planning  is a barrier -focused strategy to avoid 
unwanted responses to situational demands or social pressure. Coping plans represent a mental link between anticipated risk situations and suitable coping responses (Sniehotta, 
Schwarzer, Scholz & Schüz, 2005) . Individuals who have planned how to cope with risky 
situations are more likely to maintain newly adopted behaviour in the face of difficulties (Marlatt, 1996; Simkin & Gross, 1996; Sniehotta, Scholz & Schwarzer, 2006; Ziegelmann, 
Lippke & Schwarzer, 2006). However, few studies have applied planning as a self -regulation 
aid in adolescents. Although not conclusive, there is some evidence that simila r planning 
effects may be assumed in adolescents and adults ( Araújo -Soares, McIntyre & Sniehotta, in 
press; Mischel & Patterson, 1978; Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).  
The Health Promotion Programme “It’s your body – use it well!”  
The programme “It’s your body  – use it well!” was developed to provide theory -based 
guidelines for school -based health promotion in Portugal . Portuguese adolescents show some 
of the lowest levels of PA in Europe and an overall high prevalence of health risk behaviours (McIntyre et al. , 1998; Riddoch, et al., 2004; WHO, 2000). The overall programme consists 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 6 - 
of 12 weekly sessions and addresses health behaviours including PA, diet, physical and 
psychosexual development, prevention of risk behaviours (sexually transmitted diseases, smoking  and alcohol consumption), as well as general life skills such as assertiveness 
(McIntyre & Araújo -Soares, 2002). The  PA programme targeted SCT variables and post -
intentional self -regulatory strategies such as planning and self -monitoring . Previous research 
had shown that adolescents often lead sedentary lifestyles despite good intentions to be active (Araújo -Soares, McIntyre & Sniehotta, in press ; McIntyre et al., 1998; Riddoch et al., 2004).  
This paper reports findings from an opportunistic cluster -randomised controlled trial 
of the PA module . The term opportunistic refers to the fact that the sample size was 
determined by the availability of schools provided by the funder (Health Administration of 
Northern Portugal ) rather than by formal power analyses. Opportunistic trials  provide 
invaluable guidance when considering a potential full -scale trial in the future. They allow 
testing the feasibility and acceptability of trial procedures, highlighting potential pitfalls to avoid and providing evidence on likel y effect sizes to inform power calculations. Although 
the study was not powered to detect small effects,  it allowed estimating the possible effect 
size, making a  contribution by a) detecting possible medium to large effects, b) cumulating 
evidence towards a full RCT (Campbell, et al., 2000) and c) providing data for systematic reviews. Our research questions were:  
1.) What are the estimated group differences in changes of PA in children that received the intervention and those in the control group after th e intervention and at three and nine months 
following the intervention?  
2.) What are the estimated group differences in changes in the theoretical mediators (outcome expectancies, self -efficacy, goal commitment, action planning and coping planning) in 
children that received the intervention and those in the control group?  
 METHOD  
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 7 - 
Participants and Procedures  
Eight schools from the Northern Portuguese districts of Minho, Trás -os-Montes, and 
Douro Litoral were available for this study. They fulfilled the following criteria 1) they were 
not involved in the European Network of Health Promoting Schools in October 2002, 2) they had a school psychologist and a physical activity teacher that could be trained to deliver the intervention and 3) had at least two class es of either 6
th or 7th grades. Two classes from each 
school, ten 6th grade (64.9%) and six 7th grade (35.1%) classes comprising 291 adolescents 
participated in the study. The mean age of participants in the initial sample was 12.13 years (SD = 1.01) with a range from 10 to 16 years, 76.2% of the participants ranged from 10 to 12 
years. About half of them were male (n=138, 47.4%), 57.4% lived in rural areas.  
The study used a cluster -randomised design. In each school two classes similar in 
socio -demographic  variables were selected and randomly assigned to intervention or control 
condition after initial assessment. The full intervention consisted of 12 weekly sessions  (90 
minutes each) , consisting of an initial session with parents  (90 minutes) , a general 
introduction lesson for the children on the programme goals (90 minutes) , and two 90 minute 
sessions based on a standardised intervention manual in consecutive weeks in a classroom setting.  The remainder sessions of the programme covered other goals such as healthy eating, 
the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and the prevention of smoking, alcohol  and 
other illicit drugs. Assertiveness was another one of the topics covered.   
Physical activity, SCT variables and planning measures were taken at pre -test (3 
weeks in advance of the PA intervention) and post -test (two week after completion of the PA 
intervention) . In addition, PA was measured at 3- months and 9- months follow -up.  
Measures  
The primary outcome  measure was  physical activity  assessed with th e International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire  (IPAQ; Craig et al, 2003) for adolescents using the seven- day 
recall method. Children indicated how many sessions of activities they had engaged and how 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 8 - 
long each of these activities lasted. From this questio nnaire a measure of general moderate -
to-vigorous physical activity and exercise was derived consisting of a composite score that 
multiplied the frequency of sessions per week with minutes per session. 
Secondary outcomes were SCT and planning measures. SCT  measures were 
developed based on a belief elicitation study and pilot studies ( Araújo -Soares , et al., in press ; 
Araújo -Soares , 2006) following the guidelines of leading theorists (Ajzen, 2006; Bandura, 
2005). P articipants were first introduced to the conce pt of moderate to vigorous PA. 
Situation- outcome expectancies  were assessed by agreement with statements about negative 
outcomes resulting from the current levels of PA. The stem ‘If I continue with my current 
level of PA…’ was followed by 7 statements suc h as ‘I will become overweight’. Action -
outcome expectancies  were assessed by 5 items addressing possible positive consequences of 
regular moderate to vigorous PA, for example:  “If I engage in regular moderate to vigorous 
PA, I will have more energy and st rength”.  Self-Efficacy  was assessed by 10 items. The stem 
‘I am certain that I can engage in regular moderate to vigorous PA in the forthcoming months, even if...’ was followed by 10 possible barriers such as a) ‘…I have to study for an exam’. Behavioural Intentions  were assessed by 6 items, e.g., ‘I intend to engage in regular moderate 
to vigorous PA at least 2- 3 times a week for at least 30 to 45 minutes outside school’’. Each 
item was scored on a five -point Likert  scale from completely disagree to completely agree.  
Action planning and coping planning were measured using the Action Planning and 
Coping Planning Scales (Sniehotta, Schwarzer et al ., 2005) adapted to adolescence. Action 
planning was assessed by 4 items: ‘I have made a detailed plan regarding  [when/where/how] 
to engage in regular moderate to vigorous PA’. Coping planning was assessed by 4 items, for 
example ‘I have made a detailed plan regarding...a) what to do when something interferes with my plans (e.g. If I have a test in that week, if my f riends want to go out, etc.).  
Two pilot studies confirmed the factorial, construct and predictive validity of these 
scales (Araújo -Soares, 2006).  A scale on self -reported self -monitoring was not included in 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 9 - 
this study, because the pilot study revealed dif ficulties in understanding the items of a self -
monitoring assessment scale.  Mean values, standard deviations and correlations for Time 1 
and Time 2 and α-coefficients for all scales are displayed in Table 1.  
Intervention  
The intervention followed a detaile d manual . The manual, materials and a detailed description 
of the program are available from the corresponding author.. The PA intervention c onsisted of 
two classroom -based sessions of 90 minutes each and related homework. It was delivered by a 
trained  psychologist assisted by a sports education teacher . The psychologist  received 
manual -based training including a two -day workshop (16 hours training) by the research 
team. In addition, a member of the research team served as supervisor in preparation of each 
session. In the week proceeding both PA intervention sessions, adolescents were asked to keep a self -monitoring diary as part of their homework in which they documented their daily 
physical activities  in detail. After the intervention they were encouraged to keep the diary for 
two more weeks. During the sessions, working sheets and a brief three -minute film were used 
as additional materials . At the end of the sessions, each student received a leaflet, which 
emphasized the main topics of the session. Table 2  describes the intervention using a formal  
taxonomy of behaviour change techniques by Abraham and Michie ( in press ) along with a 
concise description of the procedures used to target the theoretical determinants of behaviour change.  
Pilot studies  
Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and the training procedures were 
established in a one -group design with pre, post and 9 months follow up, with 107 students 
from four different schools in Northern Portugal. A second pilot study tested the feasibili ty of 
the trial procedures in a randomised design with matched control condition in 116 adolescents 
(46% male; Mean age=13.4; SD 
= 1.6). In the intervention group, the proportion of 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 10 - 
participants reporting at least 3 sessions of physical exercise a week increased from 27% at 
pre test to 48% at post -test in the intervention group (McIntyre & Araújo -Soares, 2002).  
Data analyses  
Descriptive data for all outcomes are presented as means (standard deviations in 
parentheses) and correlation coefficients where relevant. Data were analysed using  multilevel 
modelling techniques;  a three level random effects analyses of covariance linear regression, 
adjusting post -intervention PA at each time point for pre -intervention PA, age and sex . We 
used a nested design with chil dren (level 1) nested within classes (level 2) nested within 
schools (level 3). Although we have repeated measures within child we used each post intervention time point as an outcome and correct for pre intervention levels of PA because introducing a four th level to the analyses would complicate the analyses more than desirable 
given the sample size.  Random effects were included for school and class to account for 
potential intra -cluster correlation  (Rabe -Hesketh & Skrondal, 2005) . Changes in cognition 
were also explored using this model. Effect sizes are presented with 95% confidence intervals. 
Missing data were assumed to be missing completely at random  because the students 
discontinuing the study  moved to other schools . All analyses were therefore conduc ted as 
complete cases  intention -to-treat  analyses  (Wood, White  & Thompson, 2004; Wood, White , 
Hillsdon  & Carpenter , 2005) . To test the robustness of the results to this assumption we also 
carried out a conservative sensitivity analysis  imputing the baselin e levels of PA  for any 
missing  data. Potential mediation was investigated following  standard criteria  (Baron, & 
Kenny, 1986) in a three -level multilevel regression framework as above.  Stata Version 9.2 
was used for all analyses.    RESULTS  
Figure 1 shows t he CONSORT trial flow chart. Intervention group and control group 
were similar with regard to age (mean(SD)
intervention = 12.19 (1.1); mean(SD) control = 12.05 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 11 - 
(0.9)), height (mean(SD) intervention = 1.49 m (0.1); mean(SD) control = 1.50 m (0.1)), weight 
(mean(SD )intervention = 42.5 kg  (9.5); mean(SD) control = 44.8 kg (9.5)), gender (47% male in the 
intervention and 48% in the control  group) and grade (65% in grade 6 in both groups). 
Students who dropped out were mostly 6th grade rs who changed to different schools as the 
new school year started between Time 3 and Time 4 and could not be followed up. Attrition 
was unrelated to the intervention and not biased with regard to social -cognitive or behavioural 
baseline measures.    
Estimation of effects  
Table 3 a shows the point estimates  and confidence intervals for PA in the intervention 
and control groups. At post -test, adolescents in the intervention group report an average of 18 
minutes  per week  more of moderate and vigorous PA than adolescents in the control group 
(CL:  -10- 46, ns). This difference increases to 33 minutes per week at 3-month follow -up and 
approaches significance (CL: - 4- 71; p=.08 ). At the 9 -month follow -up, the difference has 
increased to a highly significant difference of 57 minutes  per week  between b oth groups (CL: 
13-101, p<.01).  
The random effects regression analyses show that baseline PA (T 2: B=.33; SE=.04;  
p<.001; T3: B=.41; SE=.06; p<.001; T4: B=.27; SE=.05; p<.001) and sex (T2: B=52.5; SE=14.6; p<.001) both account for significant amounts of va riance in PA, while age does not 
contribute to the equation. The intervention only reaches significance at Time 4 (T2: B=18.1; SE=14.2; p=.20; T3: B=33.4; SE=19.2; p=.08; T4: B=57.2; SE=22.5; p=.01). These models account for 24.9% of the variance at Time 2; 29.8% at Time 3 and 36.9% at Time 4.  
The sensitivity analysis in Table 3b confirms the findings of the complete case 
intention to treat analysis. While imputing pre -intervention baseline data for missing values 
naturally decreases the point estimates of  effects, the sensitivity  analysis confirms the 
significant group differences at Time 4 and the trend approach ing significance at Time 3. The 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 12 - 
intervention seems to facilitate PA  with a cumulative effect over nine months following the 
intervention resulting  in a difference of nearly one hour a week at the end of the trial.  
Process evaluation  
Intervention- effects on theoretical target variables are shown in Table 4.  Participants 
in the intervention group showed significantly higher increases in situation outcome 
expectancies and coping planning than controls, i.e., they became more aware that their current levels of physical activity might not be sufficient to achieve positive outcomes and developed clearer plans about how to deal with barriers for regular P A. Trends for self -
efficacy and action planning favour the intervention group but remain insignificant. Small and insignificant trends favouring the control group were found for action outcome expectancies and intentions. The intervention overall seems to enhance behaviour -related cognitions for 
physical activity. However, there is no evidence that the effect of the intervention on 
behaviour is mediated by effects on cognitions  as there is no significant group effect on 
behaviour at Time 2 ( Baron, & Kenny, 1986) . Explorative analyses of a possible time -lagged 
mediation  of Time 4 effects on  behaviour through more immediate Time 2 effects of 
cognitions found no evidence for mediation.   
 
DISCUSSION  
We introduced a classroom -based intervention to increase level s of moderate and 
vigorous physical activity in adolescents. The intervention was based on social cognitive theory and self -regulation theory and incorporates action planning and coping planning. This 
is the first report to use a formal taxonomy of behaviour change techniques (Abraham & 
Michie, in press) to describe a new intervention, which is also available as full intervention manual  (McIntyre & Araújo -Soares, 2002) . The intervention was found to be acceptable and 
feasible for delivery by a school psychologist and a physical education teacher.  
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 13 - 
Two classes matched on socio -economic variables from each of 8 schools were 
randomly assigned to receive the programme or to a usual -education control condition. The 
sample size was determined by opportunity and availability rather than by formal power 
analysis. Findings need to be interpreted with this in mind, as type two errors, (failure to detect existing group differences) are more likely. Random effects multilevel modelling showed that the estimated differences in changes of physical activity between both groups increased over time from 18 minutes a week post intervention, to 33 minutes a week three months later and 57 minutes per week nine months following intervention. The key purpose of the analysis was to g ain a point estimation of the possible effect. However, the difference at 
the 9 -months follow -up is highly significant and the difference at the 3- months follow -up 
approaches statistical significance. Moreover, the point estimates compare to results of muc h 
more intensive school -based interventions (e.g., Haerens et al., 2006). Conservative 
sensitivity analyses confirmed the general pattern  of findings  while naturally resulting in 
slightly lower effect size estimates.  
The clinical significance of one hour m ore of moderate to vigorous physical activity 
per week might be modest (Rizzo et al., 2006). However, there is a growing body of evidence showing linear relationships between physical activity and health (Hallal et al, 2006). An inexpensive classroom -based  intervention can potentially reach a large number of adolescents 
and produce tremendous health promotion effects if a moderate increase in PA can be delivered to a large number of individuals. The intervention studied is of minimal intensity (two 90 minut e sessions on physical activity) and thus potentially a highly economic means of 
health promotion in schools.  
Differences in PA between intervention group and control group increased over time. 
Most behavioural interventions show immediate effects that over time lack sustainability (Marcus et al., 2006; Biddle et al., 2004). The presented data indicate a trend over time suggesting that the effects might become stronger with time. This may be due to group 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 14 - 
effects, as the intervention might have changed group norms, creating a culture of mastery 
and collective self -efficacy (Bandura, 1997). Moreover, there is evidence that collaborative 
planning interventions might be more effective than individual planning interventions (Prestwich et al., 2005). This could have resulted in a social environment reinforc ing of  
physical activity. Self -regulatory variables such as self -monitoring and coping planning have 
also been shown to be important in the maintenance of behaviour change (Sniehotta, Scholz & Schwarzer, 2005) a nd might have enabled participants in the intervention group to develop 
the skills to keep up regular physical activity. Moreover, seasonal effects might have contributed. Baseline measures were taken in October/November (autumn), post -tests in 
November/De cember (winter), 3 -months follow -up in March (spring and period for school 
exams) and the 9 -months follow -up took place in September (end of summer vacations).  
The underlying rational of a theory -based intervention is that behaviour change is 
achieved by m odifying theory -based determinants of behaviour (Michie & Abraham, 2004). 
Although a formal mediation analysis was beyond the scope of this paper due to sample size and power considerations, pre -post changes in theoretical target variables were analysed to  
test if the intervention reached its immediate targets (Table 4). Multilevel analyses indicated that adolescents in the intervention classes perceived more negative outcomes associated with their current levels of physical activity (situation -outcome expe ctancies) and reported higher 
levels of coping planning. Trends favouring the intervention group were not significant for self-efficacy and approached significance for action planning. While these findings suggest 
that the interventions successfully change d the theory -based targets, a non -significant trend 
for goal intentions in favour of the controls needs further investigation. All theoretical measures at Time 2 were significantly correlated with physical activity, further supporting the rational of targe ting these variables in the intervention (Table 1). These findings are also in 
line with recent evidence that theory -based measures of cognitions mediate the effects of 
theory -based interventions. In a recent study by Dishman et al. (2004) self -efficacy partly 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 15 - 
mediated the effects of a comprehensive school -based physical -activity programme in girls 
with a similar age to the students in this study. However, in this study, no evidence for 
mediation was found. More research is needed to understand the process of behaviour change in complex interventions (Kraemer, Wilson, & Fairburn, 2002).  
 While the SCT and SRT components of the programme “it’s your body – use it well” 
were grounded on compelling evidence in adolescents (Stone et al. 1998), the use of plannin g 
interventions in adolescence is a novel component in the programme. The only health psychology study on implementation intentions in an adolescent sample was conducted on smoking cessation (Higgins & Conner, 2004). This study failed to find beneficial ef fects of 
planning because few subjects turned out to be smokers. Coping planning interventions had not been applied to health behaviour in adolescents before (cf. Mischel & Patterson, 1978)  but 
there is some evidence that joint action planning and coping planning is predictive of changes in PA amongst adolescents (Araújo- Soares et al., in press) . The planning interventions were 
embedded in a broader strategy of preparing students for risk situations and giving them necessary background information to act on  their intentions in the face of  impediments. The 
present study shows that the intervention facilitated coping planning and slightly changed levels of action planning. Both measures show significant correlations with physical activity and the question of m ediation requires further research on planning and in children and 
adolescents.  
Limitations and future research  
This study provided estimates and confidence intervals of the intervention effects on 
PA and theoretical mediators. A full, randomised controlle d trial is needed to provide 
conclusive evidence for its effectiveness in changing behaviour and its cost -effectiveness  as 
well as for the process evaluation . This full trial will be informed by the findings of this study.  
There is some evidence that interventions including  policy and environmental changes 
together with school -based programmes are more effective than school -based programmes 
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 16 - 
alone (Timperio, Salmon & Ball, 2004). This intervention mainly focused on individual and 
social determinants of phys ical activity and involved the families to support the intervention. 
The distinction between individual and environmental determinants of behaviour is somewhat misleading. SCT  is an evidence- based theory about the interaction of individual and 
environmenta l factors and argues that the environment affects behaviour by constraining and 
changing beliefs (Bandura, 1997). Environmental interventions such as providing facilities for physical activity are likely to affect individual behaviour mediated through cognitions about control and costs. As environments will change over the lifespan, the focus on individual and social determinants has an important rational. Individual and environmental interventions are not contradictory approaches; they augment each other.  
Comparing matched  control classes with intervention classes in the same schools 
might have biased the findings due to interaction between adolescents for both classes. Although there is no evidence that casual interaction with individuals undergoing a behaviour change intervention leads to sustainable behaviour change, future studies should randomise classes between schools. If there was a bias in the present study, it would have been in favour of the null hypothesis (no group differences).  
Future research should incorporate objective measures of behaviour (e.g., 
accelerometry), as self -report measures for physical activity are potentially susceptible to bias 
due to limitations in recall accuracy (Sallis & Saelens, 2000). The use of the ‘last seven days‘ reference- period was chosen to circumvent biases in recall. Children from 10 years and above 
were shown to be able to report physical activity accurately over this time period (Kohl, Fulton & Caspersen, 2000). The IPAQ is amongst the best -studied self -repor t measures and 
validation studies indicate good reliability and acceptable validity with regard to accelerometer measures (Craig et al., 2003). O bservational measures and the use of 
monitoring devices can have strong demand characteristics which might affect self -
Theory -based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents  - 17 - 
monitoring. Since self -monitoring was one of the key components of our intervention , the use 
of retrospective self -report measures ensured the internal validity of the intervention trial.  
In conclusion, this study found significant effects of a theory based classroom -
delivered physical activity programme on self -reported physical activity 9 months following 
the intervention. It provided some insight into possible mechanisms involved in behaviour 
change. Further health promotion programmes should be  systematically developed based on 
theory and established behaviour change techniques to modify evidenced mediators of physical activity. The present study emphasised the inclusion of volitional factors such as planning and self -monitoring in an adolescent  sample.
