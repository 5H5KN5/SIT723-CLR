a theory-guided nursing discharge teaching
intervention for adult inpatients aged 50
and over with multimorbidity: a pragmatic
feasibility study protocol

Abstract
Background: Discharge teaching by nurses during hospitalization is essential to provide multimorbid inpatients
with the knowledge and skills to self-manage their health conditions. However, available disease-specific teaching
guidelines do not address the cumulative complexity of multiple chronic diseases that occur with greater frequency
in older adults. Therefore, there is a need for a discharge teaching intervention which uses concepts that
specifically address the needs of these patients, such as considering their level of activation (i.e. knowledge, skills
and confidence to self-manage their health) and the burden of multimorbid disease. The objectives of this
pragmatic study will be to (1) test the feasibility of implementing a nursing discharge teaching intervention and (2)
conduct a preliminary test of this novel discharge teaching intervention with adult inpatients age 50 or greater
who have multiple comorbid conditions.
Methods: This study uses a two-group pre-posttest design. Participants are drawn from medical units in three
hospitals in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The implementation of the intervention will be facilitated by
implementation strategies from the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behavior Change Wheel and will
target change in nurses ’teaching behaviours. Implementation outcomes will include measures of feasibility of the
implementation strategies and the intervention process. Participants in the intervention group will receive tailored
discharge teaching by trained teaching nurses. Patient outcomes will inform the preliminary testing of the
intervention and will be measured with validated questionnaires assessing patients ’activation level, health
confidence, perceived readiness for discharge, experience with the discharge process and rate of and time to
readmission.

Discussion: The study takes a pragmatic approach to examining the feasibility of implementing the discharge
teaching intervention to contribute to the knowledge development within the context of the real-world practice
setting. Results will provide the foundation for clinical trials to build evidence for widespread adoption of this
intervention.
Trial registration: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04253665 ) on the 30 of January 2020 and has
been approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Vaud in Switzerland (2020-00141).

Background
Older patients returning home after an acute health
event have to manage several chronic diseases within the
context of and in addition to their daily tasks. In
Switzerland between 2010 and 2011, 79% of hospitalized
adults discharged from internal medicine departments
were multimorbid [ 1]. When insufficiently prepared for
the transition from hospital care to home, the resulting
burden of combined health, mobility, functional and so-
cial issues can severely threaten their well-being and lead
to costly hospital readmissions [ 2]. Discharge teaching is
a crucial component of discharge preparation as it pro-
vides patients with the nec`essary skills and information
to self-manage their health at home, i.e. problem-solving
skills and abilities to make decisions to improve their
health [ 3–5]. Discharge preparation refers to a multi-
faceted care process that aims to prepare patients and
their families for their return home. This process consists
of three components: discharge planning, discharge coord-
ination and discharge teaching [ 3]. The latter refers to
educational interventions during the hospital stay that aim
to provide patients with the knowledge and skills to self-
manage their health conditions [ 3]. High-quality discharge
teaching is associated with improved readiness for dis-
charge, adherence to discharge care plans and reductions
in mortality, readmission and cost of care [ 6–10].
To teach multimorbid inpatients, healthcare providers
rely mainly on available disease-specific guidelines that
do not address this cumulative complexity and resulting
treatment burden, nor provide guidance for considering
patient preferences [ 11,12]. The work of being a patient
includes a wide range of activities in terms of under-
standing diseases, managing treatments, health self-
monitoring, visits to doctors, self-care, etc. [ 13,14]. To
avoid additional burden by intensifying care, prioritizing
needs for the return home is one of the keys to multi-
morbidity management [ 15,16]. But while patients usu-
ally prioritize the diseases for which they experience the
most symptoms or those that interfere with their social
activities or independence, health professionals prioritize
according to prognosis, severity of the disease and con-
sequences [ 15]. In planning teaching objectives with pa-
tients, it is therefore important to consider the balancebetween the burden of disease management at home
and patient ’s capacity to cope with it [ 15–17]. To ensure
that the teaching is appropriate to the patient ’s abilities,
patient activation also appears to be a crucial character-
istic to consider when tailoring the discharge teaching
[18]. Activation refers to patient knowledge, skill and
confidence for self-management [ 19]. Deficiencies in
current discharge teaching practices for multimorbid in-
patients point to the critical need to develop and test a
teaching intervention that is not disease-specific and
thus applicable to the broad range of patients being dis-
charged from hospital with one or more concurrent
conditions.
Several barriers to discharge teaching delivery interfere
with effective discharge teaching. In a European study
conducted with 33,659 nurses, 41% reported to have left
patient education undone on their last shift [ 20]. De-
creasing average lengths of stay, and thereby the time
available for discharge preparation, result in limited time
to pass on skills, provide targeted information and check
whether patients understand their discharge instructions.
Units ’workflow often results in patients leaving the hos-
pital on the same day the discharge decision is made,
with the consequence that discharge teaching is deliv-
ered hurriedly before the patient returns home [ 21]. In
addition to spending too little time on discharge teach-
ing, assessment of patients ’comprehension of discharge
instructions is not done in a specific or systematic way
[22]. Informational content is forgotten immediately
after discharge by 40 –80% of patients in acute care, and
half of the information received is recalled incorrectly
[23]. Patients ’misunderstanding of discharge instruc-
tions can lead to noncompliance and ineffective self-
management [ 24]. These issues highlight a discrepancy
between professionals ’belief that they address patients ’
needs through discharge teaching, the relevance of the
content and the adequacy of the way of providing teach-
ing for patients returning home [ 4,25,26].
As discharge teaching practice remains unsatisfactory
in French-speaking Switzerland, overcoming implemen-
tation barriers requires understanding of the nature of
the nurses ’behaviour to be changed and identifying
types of intervention that could effectively support thesePellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 2 of 13
changes [ 27,28]. While individual nurses are influenced
by organization level policies and practices, we assume
that any intervention to improve discharge process
would certainly fail without first targeting a practice
change in discharge teaching. To facilitate discharge
teaching implementation as part of the discharge prepar-
ation, the application of a behaviour change framework
will support the design of theoretically underpinned
strategies that aim to change behaviours at individual
nurse level [ 29–31].
With regard to these different elements, undertaking
an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study raises con-
cerns regarding effect size of a non-diseases-specific
teaching intervention and necessary implementation
strategies to change practices at nurses ’level [ 29]. We
will perform this study to address whether a hybrid type
II study will be an appropriate design and feasible with
regard to participant recruitment and retention, out-
come acceptability, intervention feasibility, acceptability
and appropriateness and minimum important difference.
This article outlines a protocol for a feasibility study.
The objectives will be to (1) test the feasibility of imple-
menting a novel nursing discharge teaching intervention
for older patients (age 50 or more) with multiple chronic
conditions hospitalized in medical units and (2) conduct
a preliminary test of this novel discharge teaching inter-
vention on multimorbid inpatients ’activation level,
health confidence, readiness for hospital discharge, ex-
perience with discharge care and rate of and time to
readmission.
Method
Study design
This study is a pragmatic feasibility study using a two
group pre/post-intervention comparative design. This
protocol is presented as per the SPIRIT (Standard Proto-
col Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials)
guideline and Thabane and Lancaster ’s guidance on how
to report protocols of pilot and feasibility trials [ 32,33].
All elements of the SPIRIT checklist adapted with the
CONSORT extension are reported in Additional file 1.
This study has been approved by the Cantonal Ethics
Committee Vaud (2020-00141). Written informed con-
sent will be obtained from eligible patients by the re-
searcher. Nurses participating in the study will receive
an information sheet and be asked for written consent.
Setting
The nursing discharge teaching intervention will be im-
plemented in three medical units, one in a teaching hos-
pital (21 beds, 17 registered nurses) and two in two
community-based hospitals (34 beds, 22 registered
nurses and 22 beds, 15 registered nurses). The three
hospitals are located in the French-speaking part ofSwitzerland. Medical units were preferred to surgical
units because medical patients generally have a higher
proportion of older multimorbid patients who have
complex discharge needs and higher rates of readmis-
sion. Agreement of nurse managers will be the basis for
units to participate. They will provide data on contextual
and organizational characteristics of their units and will
be the contact person for each setting for the coordin-
ation of the study process.
Participants and recruitment
A sample of 12 –15 nurses (4 –5 per unit) will be re-
cruited on a voluntary basis to take part in the study.
Their participation will involve being trained in the
intervention, delivering it during the implementation
phase, participating in qualitative and quantitative evalu-
ations in the pre- and post-implementation phase of
their teaching behaviours and feasibility of the interven-
tion. Inclusion criteria for nurse participants will be reg-
istered nurses, employed full time (80 –100% work rate).
Inclusion criteria for participants will be 50 years old
or more, having two or more chronic conditions, being
hospitalized for more than 48 h, an expected discharge
home defined at the beginning of the hospitalization and
fluent speaking, reading and writing in French [ 34]. The
inclusion criterion of 50 and over was chosen because
from this age onwards the prevalence of multimorbidity
is constantly increasing [ 35]. These criteria are deliber-
ately broad in order to obtain a sufficient diversity of pa-
tients to reflect the variations encountered in patients in
real-world practice. Patients will be excluded if they are
cognitively unable to give their informed consent.
As this is a feasibility study, there is no sample size
calculation [ 36]. A convenience sample of 180 hospital-
ized patients (90 pretest/90 posttest) was determined
based on an estimate of the number of patients meeting
the criteria for inclusion in the medical units of 30 pa-
tients per unit month. With an estimated recruitment
rate of 50%, 30 pretest and 30 posttest patients per unit
could be recruited over a 2-month period to achieve the
180-patient sample. Pretest participants will be recruited
before nurses ’training about discharge teaching to pre-
vent contamination. All eligible patients will be informed
about the study and recruited four preselected days per
week in two sites and 2 days per week in the third site
due to resources ’constraints. Patients in the control and
intervention groups will be recruited within 2 days after
admission. Patients eligible to participate will be identi-
fied by the units ’nurses trained on participants ’inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria. They will routinely screen
newly admitted inpatients and inform the researcher of
eligible patients. During recruitment days, all eligible pa-
tients will be informed about the study and asked for
participation.Pellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 3 of 13
Study procedure
Patients ’outcomes will be measured during a control
period with patients receiving usual care, followed by
outcomes measurements during the implementation
period with patients receiving the discharge teaching
intervention. The discharge teaching intervention will be
implemented as an enhancement to usual care provided
to patients hospitalized on the study units and therefore
requires change/improvement in nurses ’teaching behav-
iours to achieve successful outcomes of the teaching
intervention. The plan for implementation by clinical
nurses of the discharge teaching intervention is based on
the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Be-
havior Change Wheel (BCW) of the COM-B model [ 31,
37].
The TDF consists in 14 domains identifying influences
on health professional behaviour [ 37]. This framework
will be used to identify which domains should be priori-
tized in implementation approaches to change nurses ’
behaviours. These interventions will be informed by the
BCW, which is a synthesis of 19 frameworks of behav-
iour change comprising nine intervention functions [ 31].
Intervention functions are broad categories of interven-
tions that can change nurses ’behaviours [ 31]. To de-
velop the implementation plan, we will rely on the four-
step method proposed by French et al. [ 30,38]. These
are identifying the problem, assessing the problem,
forming possible solutions and evaluating the selected
intervention. Details of steps 1 –4 are presented in Fig. 1
and Additional files 2and3.
Intervention
Conceptual basis for the intervention
We performed a realist review to shed light on the rela-
tional mechanisms triggered between nurses and pa-
tients during the interactive discharge teaching –learning
process [ 39]. The realist review resulted in a programme
theory of discharge teaching, explaining how the inter-
vention might work and in which circumstances [ 40].
This programme theory is formed of configurations be-
tween context, mechanism and outcomes (CMO config-
urations) developed from a synthesis of theories of
learning and patient education, research literature and
expert opinions. Context was defined as the micro-level
setting of patient –nurse relationship in which a dis-
charge teaching intervention takes place. Mechanisms
are defined as “underlying entities, processes, or struc-
tures which operate in particular contexts to generate
outcomes of interest ”[41]. Outcomes are defined as
consequences resulting from intervention activities oc-
curring in a given context [ 42]. The 10 CMOs identified
in the realist review were as follows: (1) information
needs, (2) tailored teaching delivery, (3) patient activa-
tion, (4) interviewing skills, (5) teaching skills, (6)teachable opportunities, (7) priority concerns about go-
ing home, (8) making sense of the hospital stay experi-
ence, (9) discharge teaching as a care and (10) involving
the caregivers (see Additional file 4)[18]. By generating
a more explanatory than descriptive theory of discharge
teaching, this programme theory helped us develop an
intervention that explains in detail how to tailor the
teaching to patients ’needs using the identified mecha-
nisms. To facilitate operationalization of the CMOs, we
incorporated four methodological strategies to guide
nurses to tailor the teaching to the unique needs of mul-
timorbid older patients: the minimally disruptive medi-
cine model (MDM), patient activation, the patient-
oriented discharge summary and the theoretical frame-
work to guide patient/family teaching [ 14,43,44]. Add-
itional files 4and5present how the programme theory,
concepts or theories, intervention components, imple-
mentation components and outcomes are related.
Intervention process
The discharge teaching intervention begins by identify-
ingpriorities to address related to patients ’life situation
(using the Instrument for Patient Capacity Assessment)
and determining the patient ’s current level of activation
(using the Patient Activation Measure) [ 43,45]. A Dis-
charge Teaching Guide developed by the Principal In-
vestigator helps to individualize the teaching to the
patient ’s priorities and level of activation. It will be used
by trained teaching nurses to deliver the teaching and
includes six domains of self-management. These six do-
mains of self-management correspond to those of the
patient-oriented discharge summary (PODS), which is a
document provided to the patient by the teaching nurse
that summarizes what has been addressed in discharge
teaching. For each domain, teaching nurses first report
in the Discharge Teaching Guide whether a priority has
been identified with the Instrument for Patient Capacity
Assessment (ICAN) and what intervention they have
proposed to address it. Then for each domain, this guide
provides teaching objectives which differ according to
the level of patient activation previously evaluated with
the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) (Fig. 2).
Assessment measures used by nurses in the intervention
Patients ’life situation The first element of the teaching
intervention is assessment of the patients ’life situation,
assessed with the ICAN. The ICAN was developed from
a systematic review on patients ’capacity and a user-
centred design of a discussion aid about patient capacity
[45]. Observations during clinical encounters and nurse
home visits were followed by the development and test-
ing prototypes, resulting in the final ICAN Discussion
Aid (see Additional file 6). The ICAN was found feasiblePellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 4 of 13
Fig. 1 Steps of the implementation planPellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 5 of 13
to use during clinical encounters [ 46]. Using video-
graphic coding scheme, results also showed that issues
discussed with the ICAN were seldom discussed during
control clinical encounters [ 46]. A randomized con-
trolled trial is ongoing to test the impact on patient and
healthcare teams ’care experience and communication,
while reducing patient treatment burden
(NCT03017196).
Teaching nurses will give the ICAN to participants in
a leaflet form as soon as they are enrolled early in the
hospitalization, explaining that it will help them to learn
more about their lives and how that interacts with their
health and healthcare. Participants will be asked to check
relevant boxes related to 11 life domains and eight clin-
ical demands to classify these as source of burden or sat-
isfaction/help [ 45]. The ICAN will remain on the
patient ’s bedside table so that the nurse who will deliver
the teaching can read it beforehand. Nurses will check
with participants if there are any priorities among what
they identified as a burden in the different domains that
should be addressed for their return home. Clinical de-
mand domains listed in the ICAN are linked to the self-
management domains of the Discharge Teaching Guide.
Before starting to teach one of the areas of self-
management, teaching nurses must first check with pa-
tients whether there is a priority in terms of clinical de-
mand to be addressed and, if so, will be instructed to
briefly describe the proposed intervention to address it.
Attending to relevant patient priorities and burdenspromote patients ’workload-capacity balance and
prioritization of care [ 47]. The ICAN will also be useful
in identifying possible resources that patients could
mobilize.
Patient activation Participants will be asked by teaching
nurses to complete the Patient Activation Measure
(PAM). The PAM is a 13-item self-report questionnaire
to measure patient activation level [ 43]. Patients can go
through four levels of activation: (1) disengaged and
overwhelmed, (2) becoming aware but still struggling,
(3) taking action and (4) maintaining behaviours and
pushing further. Stages of activation are distributed as
follows in the PAM items: items 1 –2, believing an active
role is important; items 3 –8, having confidence and
knowledge to take action; items 9 –11, taking action; and
items 12 –13, continuing healthy behaviours under stress.
Responses range from 1 = “strongly disagree ”to 4 =
“strongly agree ”. PAM raw score can be calculated by
adding all of the responses to the 13 questions. This
score is then converted into an activation score ranging
from 0 = no activation to 100 = high activation using a
scoresheet provided by Insignia Health®. Psychometric
properties of the PAM in hospitalized multimorbid pa-
tients showed a satisfying reliability (Cronbach ’s alpha =
0.88) and a content validity index of 0.91 [ 48]. Another
study in the inpatient setting provided evidence for the
internal consistency reliability (Cronbach ’s alpha = 0.81)
and the construct validity of the PAM-13 [ 49]. A PAMFig. 2 Summary of the discharge teaching intervention processPellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 6 of 13
research license will be obtained from Insignia Health®,
which will provide a validated French version of the
PAM-13 and the scoresheet [ 50]. The level of activation
calculated with the PAM will define which category of
Discharge Teaching Guide the nurses will use. The guide
corresponding to the participant activation level will
guide them towards which objectives related to self-
management domains are realistic based on this level.
Levels 1 and 2 describe patients who are rather passive
recipients of care and who lack basic health knowledge,
for whom the objectives aim at increasing the awareness
or basic knowledge of their health information. Teaching
objectives for patients with a moderate level of activation
(level 3) aim to support them in developing their know-
ledge and skills in managing their health and encourage
them to play a more active role in their care. For pa-
tients with a high level of activation (level 4), the objec-
tives aim to complete missing knowledge and help them
to prevent relapses.
Teaching methods used by nurses to deliver the
intervention
Discharge Teaching Guide The Discharge Teaching
Guide was designed to guide nurses in how to conduct
discharge teaching incorporating patient priorities iden-
tified using the ICAN, patient activation level identified
using the PAM, and the six self-management domains
identified in the PODS: reason for hospitalization, warn-
ing signs, medication plan, health behaviours, next ap-
pointments and which person to contact if needed. In
the Discharge Teaching Guide, a first row for each do-
main of self-management reminds nurses to first check
with the ICAN if patients experience any burden or pri-
ority that should be addressed for their return home. If
this is the case, nurses must then report in the guide the
proposed intervention to address this burden or priority.
The Discharge Teaching Guide then supports nurses in
addressing teaching objectives in each domain of self-
management tailored to the patient's level of activation
and suggests interventions to achieve these objectives.
The guide also includes checkboxes to remind nurses to
complete the PODS (see below) with patients to
summarize the teaching content discussed for the man-
agement of their health at home. Teach-back is also
recalled as a technique to be used to promote patient
understanding and will have been taught to nurses dur-
ing the intervention training.
Patient-Oriented Discharge Summary Patient-Ori-
ented Discharge Summary (PODS) is a simple tool, con-
taining meaningful information for patients presented in
an easy-to-understand format [ 44]. This summary is a
one-page document, with key information to becompleted, such as the reason for hospitalization, warn-
ing signs to be monitored, who to call depending on the
problem, the treatment plan and upcoming medical ap-
pointments. Participants will receive it at the beginning
of the intervention, at the same time as the ICAN and
the PAM. The PODS will be filled out during the hos-
pital stay by the participant and the teaching nurse as
teaching relevant to discharge occurs. Teaching nurses
will review and verify on the day of discharge that the
information written in the PODS correspond to the
teaching content that was discussed (Fig. 2). Participants
take the PODS home at discharge to serve as a reference
for relevant and individualized discharge information in
the post-discharge period.
Data collection
Study data will be collected and managed using RED-
Cap™electronic data capture tools hosted at the Lau-
sanne University Hospital. Collection of both
quantitative and qualitative data for the objective 1 will
comprise (a) online questionnaires completed by the
teaching nurses at pre- and post-implementation phases
to assess changes in barriers to implementation and be-
liefs and attitudes regarding the importance of patient
activation; (b) online questionnaires at pre-
implementation phase for nurse managers to assess
units ’readiness for research utilization in practice and
structural and organizational environment; (c) a TDF-
based focus group with teaching nurses at pre-
implementation phase to qualitatively assess perceived
barriers to discharge teaching; (d) online questionnaires
at post-implementation phase for teaching nurses to as-
sess feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of the
intervention; (e) self-reported measure by teaching nurses
of intervention fidelity during implementation phase; and
(f) a focus group with teaching nurses at post-
implementation phase to assess the appropriateness and
the relevancy of the implementation strategies (Fig. 3).
Collection of quantitative data for the objective 2 will
comprise (a) patient participants questionnaires at the
beginning of the hospital stay, the day of discharge and a
telephone survey 7 –10 days after discharge and (b) chart
reviews to collect participants ’socio-demographic and
medical data, and readmissions within 7 days (Figs. 2
and3).
Study measures
Objective 1: Test the feasibility of implementing the nursing
discharge teaching intervention
Changes in behavioural determinants regarding the im-
plementation of the intervention will be assessed with
the Determinants of Implementation Behavior Question-
naire (DIBQ), which is based on the TDF domains [ 51].
The DIBQ will be completed by teaching nurses at pre-Pellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 7 of 13
and post-implementation phase. The questionnaire com-
prises 93 items, investigating 18 domains of behavioural
determinants: knowledge, skills, social/professional and
role and identity, beliefs about capabilities, optimism, be-
liefs about consequences, intentions, goals, innovation,
socio-political context, organization, patient, innovation
strategy, social influences, positive emotions, negative
emotions, behavioural regulation and nature of the be-
haviours. Responses are scored from 1 (strongly dis-
agree) to 7 (strongly agree). Discriminant content
validity with the TDF domains resulted in items discrim-
inately assessing 11 out of the 14 domains [ 52]. Internal
consistency values of the 18 domains range from 0.68 to
0.93 [ 51]. The DIBQ will be translated into French ac-
cording to Wild ’s method [ 53].
Changes in nurses ’attitudes regarding the importance
of patient self-management behaviours will be evaluated
with the Clinician Support for Patient Activation Meas-
ure (CS-PAM) [ 54]. The CS-PAM will be completed by
teaching nurses at pre- and post-implementation phases.
The CS-PAM consists of 14 items taken from the PAM
and prefaced with the question “As a clinician, how im-
portant is it to you that patients …”. Responses are
scored on a 4-point Likert scale from Extremely import-
anttoNot important . Data of CS-PAM will be sent to
Insignia Health®, the licensing rights supplier for this in-
strument, who will score the data and send the results
back [ 50]. This 14-item measure had a Cronbach ’s alpha
of 0.86, and Rasch analysis provided an overall person
reliability of 0.80 tested with primary care clinician [ 54].As no French-version is available, the CS-PAM will be
translated according to Wild ’s method [ 53].
Acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of the
intervention will be evaluated in the post-
implementation phase by teaching nurses with three im-
plementation outcome measures recently developed by
Weiner et al. [ 55] to assess the success of implementa-
tion efforts: Acceptability of Intervention Measure
(AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)
and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM). Each
measure has 4 items, with scale values ranging from 1
(completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Higher
scores indicate greater acceptability, appropriateness and
feasibility. These three measures have demonstrated
promising psychometric properties: Cronbach alphas of
0.85 for AIM, 0.91 for IAM and 0.89 for FIM and test-
retest reliability of 0.83 (AIM), 0.87 (IAM) and 0.88
(FIM) [ 55].
Fidelity of the discharge teaching delivery will be de-
termined by entry of intervention activities on the Dis-
charge Teaching Guide. Nurses will use a Discharge
Teaching Guide for each patient enrolled in the study,
on which they will record in check boxes each interven-
tion they delivered to their patient. A descriptive inter-
pretation will be done to analyse the level of fidelity.
Appropriateness of implementation strategies will also
be explored through a focus group conducted by the re-
searcher with teaching nurses during the post-
implementation phase. The nurses will be asked which
implementation strategies were most useful to them inFig. 3 Data collection and implementation processPellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 8 of 13
facilitating the implementation and the delivery of the
discharge teaching intervention.
Objective 2: To conduct a preliminary test of the nursing
discharge teaching intervention
Health confidence The Health Confidence Score (HCS)
is an easy-to-obtain proxy measure for the patient acti-
vation construct [ 56]. As this instrument has been very
recently validated, there are currently no other validation
studies or studies that have tested that it as an activation
proxy. However, many authors in the field agree on this
fact, knowing that confidence is one of the underlying
concepts of patient activation [ 57,58]. The HCS is a
short measure (4 items) of patients ’confidence to man-
age their health and engage with healthcare providers
[56]. Four dimensions are explored: knowledge, self-
management, access to help and shared decision-
making. Items have four response options (3=strongly
agree, 2=agree, 1=neutral, 0=disagree). Scores are re-
ported for each item and the higher the score, the higher
the confidence. A summary score is calculated with a
13-point scale by adding the individual items scores,
with a range from 0 (4×disagree) to the ceiling 12
(4×strongly agree). This instrument has good internal
consistency (Cronbach ’s alpha = 0.82) and construct val-
idity [ 56]. The HCS will be translated in French accord-
ing to Wild ’s method [ 53].
Readiness for hospital discharge The Readiness for
Hospital Discharge Scale –Short Form (RHDS-SF) is an
eight-item self-reported questionnaire [ 59]. Four dimen-
sions measure personal status, knowledge to manage the
post-hospital period, the ability to adapt to new health
needs and the expected support [ 59]. Each item is scored
on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, with the highest score in-
dicating better perceived readiness. A mean score of less
than 7 indicates low ready for hospital discharge [ 6,60].
The short form of the RHDS explains 93% of the scale
variance and reliability was 0.79 [ 59]. Results of predict-
ive validity for older people showed that patients with
higher scores were less likely to be readmitted (OR =
0.89, CI (95%) = 0.80-0.98, P= 0.03) [ 61]. The nine-item
RHDS-SF for older people available in French will be
used although the validation has not yet been carried
out [ 61].
Rate of and time to readmission Rate of and time to
readmission will be measured by consulting administra-
tive hospitalization data 7 days after patient discharge.
Only readmission for the index hospitalization will be
included.Experience with discharge care Patients ’experience
with discharge care process will be assessed 7 to 10 days
after discharge with the 11 items of the Discharge Care
Experiences Survey (DICARES) [ 62]. This instrument in-
vestigates three domains: coping after discharge (4
items), adherence to treatment (3 items) and participa-
tion in discharge planning (4 items). The answer for
each item ranges from 1 ( “Not at all ”)t o5( “To a very
large extent ”), with higher scores indicating more posi-
tive experience. The psychometric evaluation of the
DICARES in older patients showed an excellent test-
retest reliability (ICC=0.76, CI 95; 0.70, 0.82), satisfactory
construct validity (rho = 0.54, p<0.01) and an acceptable
internal consistency (Cronbach ’s alpha = 0.82) [ 62,63].
Sociodemographic and medical characteristics The
following baseline participants sociodemographic and
health data will be collected from health electronic re-
cords and reported in a REDCap ™electronic case report
form (eCRF): age, sex, number of chronic conditions,
years living with a chronic disease, length of stay and
use of home health care services before and after index
hospitalization. To determine the number of chronic
conditions, a list of 75 chronic conditions most relevant
in multimorbidity and developed by experts in
Switzerland will be used to retrieve data on chronic con-
ditions from discharge data from electronic records and
coded as 1=the condition is present and 0= the condi-
tion is absent [ 64]. Total number of chronic conditions
will be calculated for each patient. Number of previous
hospitalizations in the same hospital within the last year
will be retrieved from administrative hospitalization data
and patients will be asked for information about prior
hospitalization in a different hospital. As cohabitation
and education are usually not specified in health elec-
tronic records, these questions will be asked directly to
the participants.
Data analysis
Objective 1: Test the feasibility of implementing the nursing
discharge teaching intervention
Domains-level data of the Determinants of Implementa-
tion Behavior Questionnaire (DIBQ) will be analysed as
categorical data. The proportion of nurses responding
“agree ”or“strongly agree ”, indicating that the domain is
a facilitating determinant of implementation behaviour,
will be reported for items and domain. The same will be
done for hindering domains indicated by “disagree ”or
“strongly disagree ”responses.
CS-PAM responses will be reported in a scoring
spreadsheet provided by Insignia Health® and will be
sent to the license supplier who will calculate and send
back the scoring. Assessment of differences in nurses ’
beliefs and attitudes about patient activation betweenPellet et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2021) 7:71 Page 9 of 13
pre- and post-implementation phase will be undertaken
through comparison tests (Student ’st-test).
Descriptive statistical analyses will be conducted to ob-
tain means and standard deviations of Acceptability of
Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriate-
ness Measure (IAM) and Feasibility of Intervention
Measure (FIM). Higher scores will indicate greater ac-
ceptability, appropriateness and feasibility. The interven-
tion will also be considered as feasible within clinical
practice and for pragmatic clinical research if the re-
cruitment rate is higher than 50%, the loss to follow up
is less than 20% and more than 80% of outcome measure
are completed. Progression criteria that will inform the
decision to conduct a larger and definitive trial are de-
tailed in Additional material 7[65].
Content analysis of focus groups will also be carried
out to provide information on behavioural determinants
for the intervention, as well as acceptability, appropriate-
ness and feasibility of the implementation strategies [ 66].
The focus groups will be transcribed in verbatim and
read through several times first to get a sense of the
whole. Transcripts will be coded deductively, using the
18 TDF domains as well as acceptability and feasibility
of the implementation strategies as categories. The re-
sults will be discussed in the research group on the one
hand linking them to the results of the DIBQ survey and
to understand more fully behavioural determinants for
implementation, and on the other hand to explore, based
on the implementation outcomes, which implementation
strategies could be used best in future trials.
Objective 2: Conduct a preliminary test of the nursing
discharge teaching intervention
Descriptive statistical analyses of all variables will be
conducted to obtain means and standard deviations for
continuous variables and proportions for categorical var-
iables. Assessment of differences in patient activation,
health confidence, readiness for hospital discharge, ex-
perience with discharge care and readmission rates be-
tween pre and post-test participants will be undertaken
through comparison tests (Student ’sttest and chi-
square test). Effect size and confidence interval of the
intervention will be estimated to be able to calculate the
sample size for future efficacy studies [ 67]. Effect size of
the intervention will be estimated with a linear regres-
sion model of level of patient activation and health con-
fidence at discharge on levels measured at admission.
The adjusted model will include following variables: age,
sex, level of education and number of chronic diseases.
In light of our sample size, effect size will be interpreted
with consideration of both the magnitude and pvalue
[68]. All analyses will be carried out using Stata 16 com-
puting software [ 69].Discussion
This paper presents a study protocol for judging the
feasibility of a nursing discharge teaching intervention
for inpatients with chronic conditions in French-
speaking Swiss hospitals. Adopting a pragmatic ap-
proach, the planned feasibility study has the potential to
generate a better understanding of how an intervention
can be implemented and tested in “real-world ”clinical
practice [ 70]. Most of nursing activities are guided by
descriptive frameworks of interventions, prescribing
what nurses should do. The discharge teaching interven-
tion proposed in this study differs precisely because it
has been developed on the basis of an explanatory model
of how discharge teaching works and under what cir-
cumstances [ 39].
The proposed innovative discharge teaching interven-
tion uses the patient activation concept and patients ’life
situation to individualize and better tailor the teaching.
Taking these factors into account is expected to contrib-
ute to changes in how nurses prepare patients for dis-
charge. In addition, this study will also generate new
knowledge in the patient teaching field because the acti-
vation concept has not yet been applied in the context
of preparation for discharge from an acute
hospitalization. Results will therefore contribute to de-
termining whether older and multimorbid inpatients
could benefit from applying the concept of patient acti-
vation to discharge teaching.
As implementation of discharge teaching remains
unsatisfactory in French-speaking Switzerland, a pre-
liminary step appears necessary to enhance nurses ’
awareness about the importance of discharge teaching
[27]. Any intervention to improve discharge process
would certainly fail without targeting a practice
change in discharge teaching. The use of an imple-
mentation framework will help us to generate an un-
derstanding of factors at nurses ’individual level that
contribute to the success or failure of the intervention
implementation. Thus, understanding how to success-
fully implement discharge teaching in the real-world
practice will help to remove obstacles often encoun-
tered when implementing interventions initially tested
in highly controlled conditions, in the real-world
practice. Results will inform future design of a hybrid
type II trial to determine effectiveness of the dis-
charge teaching intervention and implementation ap-
proaches [ 29].
