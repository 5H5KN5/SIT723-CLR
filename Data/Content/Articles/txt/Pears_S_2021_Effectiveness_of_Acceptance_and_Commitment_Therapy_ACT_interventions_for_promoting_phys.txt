ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 2 - 2 
Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and is a key risk 1 
factor for non -communicable diseases ( NCDs) such as cardiovascular d isease, some cancers 2 
and type 2 diabetes (Lee et al. 2012).  Worldwide, inactivity is estimated to cause 9% of 3 
premature mortality, and if inactivity were decreased by 10%, more than 533,000 deaths 4 
could be averted every year  (Lee et al. 2012) .  The World Health Organisation (WHO) 5 
recommendations for adults aged 18 –64 are for at least 150 minutes of at least moderate - 6 
intensity aerobic physical activity (such as brisk walking or cycling) per week (WHO, 2019) . 7 
However, the majority of the world’s population do es not meet these recommendations (Ding 8 
et al. 2016 ; Rhodes , Janssen, Bredin, Warburton, & Bauman,  2017),  and globally physical 9 
inactivity is on the rise (Lee et al. 2012). Given the public health burden associated with 10 
physically inactive lifestyles, there is a critical need for interventions that are effective i n 11 
promoting the adoption and maintenance of regular physical activity , and over the last two 12 
decades, a wide range of interventions have been developed and evaluated in efforts to 13 
improve population levels of physical activity  (PA)  (Howlett , Trivedi, Troop , & Chater,  14 
2019).  15 
Grounding health promotion interventions in theory is often viewed as ‘good pra ctice’  16 
(Glanz & Rimer,  2005 ; Taylor , Conner, & Lawton, 2012 ; Prestwich , Webb, & Conner,  17 
2015) , and in many cases  the development and evaluation of physical ac tivity interventions 18 
has been guided by theory. The most common theories that have been used in the 19 
development of physical activity interventions are intrapersonal and interpersonal theories, 20 
such as the Health Belief Model (HBM ; Rosenstock , 1974 ), the Stages of Change 21 
(Transthe oretical) Model (TTM ; Prochaska & Velicer, 1997 ), the Theory of Planned 22 
Behaviour (TPB ; Ajzen, 1991 ), and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT ; Bandura, 1986 ) (Glanz et 23 
al. 2005) .  All of these theories have in common that they attempt to  promote behaviour 24

change by targeting factors such as an individual’s knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, motivation, 25 
and skills in order to increase their intention to engage in the target behaviour (Glanz & 26 
Rimer, 2005 ; Rhodes & Nigg,  2011) , and all have bee n shown to be effective at inducing a 27 
small to medium effect size on physical activity  behaviour (Gourlan et al. 2016) . Recently, 28 
however, there has been interest in the potential for basing health behaviour change 29 
interventions on a relatively new context ual and acceptance -based approach known as 30 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)  (Zhang et al. 2018 ; Hayes , Strosahl, & Wilson,  31 
1999 ; Hayes , Luoma, Bond FW, & Masuda,  2006) . 32 
 33 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and the Psychological Flexibility Model 34 
of Behaviour Change  35 
Unlike many othe r behaviour change  interventions , ACT doesn’t aim to directly 36 
change internal experiences (such as thoughts, beliefs about capability, memor ies, feelings, or 37 
bodily sensations etc.), but instead aims to foster acceptance and mindfulness skills to enable 38 
greater behavioural regulation in the presence of these internal experiences (Zhang et al. , 39 
2018) . This increase in behavioural regulation has  been called ‘psychological flexibility’, 40 
which is defined as “ contacting the present moment fully as a conscious human being, and 41 
based on what the situation affords, changing or persisting in behaviour in the service of 42 
chosen values ” (Biglan , Hayes, & P istorello, 2008) . In other words, fostering psychological 43 
flexibility encourages individuals to change their relationships with internal experiences 44 
(rather than changing the experiences themselves) in such a way that they can engage in 45 
desired behaviours (e.g. increasing physical activity), even in the presence of difficult 46 
thoughts (e.g. ‘I’m too tired ’, ‘I don’t have time to exercise ’) and feelings (e.g. the physical 47 
discomfort that comes with moderate -vigorous exercise).  48

 49 
To date, ACT is the most researched intervention model based on  the psychological 50 
flexibility model of behavio ur change (Zhang et al. , 2018). According to this model, 51 
psychological flexibility is the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a 52 
conscious human being, and to change or persist in behaviour when doing so serves valued 53 
ends. To build p sychological flexibility , ACT interventions target six core processes  (Zhang 54 
et al., 2018; Hayes et al., 1999; Hayes et al., 2006; Biglan et al., 2008) : 1) Acceptance  (the 55 
willingness to have and accept private experiences); 2)  Defusion  (the ability to see thoughts 56 
as descriptions of one’s experience and not actual reality) ; 3) Contact with the Present 57 
Moment  (the ability to fully open to and aware of what  is happening in the present moment); 58 
4) Self-As-Context  (awareness of an ‘observing self’, as distinct from the experiences 59 
observed);  5) Values  (directions in life that an individual can choose to guide their 60 
behaviour);  and 6) Committed Action  (Engaging in a pattern of behavio ur, in pursuit of short - 61 
and medium -term health -related goals, that is consistent with identified values). More 62 
detailed d efinitions of the six core ACT processes can be found in Supplementary Document 63 
1. In addition to these six key processes , ACT interventions often begin  with Creative 64 
Hopelessness , the aim of which is to undermine the control agenda and promote a more 65 
workable, expansive behavioural repertoire . The control agenda is  the belief that people often 66 
have that in order to engage in behaviours that are important or meaningful, they must first 67 
control how they think or feel – for instance, to feel motivated, to feel less tired, or to have 68 
more confidence. While not one of the six core processes targeted by ACT, Creative  69 
Hopelessness  is often viewed as being critical to opening an individual up to a new way of 70 
relating to their internal experiences and is thought to help pave the way for working with the 71

 - 5 - 5 
six core processes. A more detailed definition  of Creative Hop elessness can be found in 72

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for Physical Activity  75 
Generally, ACT -based interventions have shown promise for promoting a range of 76 
health behaviours, including smoking cessation (Gifford et al. 2004 ; Gifford et al. 2011 ; 77 
Hernández -López , Luciano, Bricker, Roales -Nieto, & Montesinos, 2009 ; Bricker et al. , 2017; 78 
Bricker et al. , 2014) and weight management (Forman & Butryn,  2015 ; Lillis , Hayes, 79 
Bunting, & Masuda, 2009 ; Lillis  & Kendra, 2014) , and evidence is emerging that ACT -based 80 
interventions may be effective for promoting physical activity (Zhang et al. , 2018) . Although 81 
physical activity confers many benefits, it is also inconvenient and requires considerable time 82 
and energy, it may not b e intrinsically enjoyable, and the discomfort associated with physical 83 
activity initiation can be a strong contributor to premature termination (Ekkekakis , 84 
Hargreaves, & Parfitt, 2013) . Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), therefore, is 85 
particularly su itable for physical activity because it encourages:   86 
1. Experiential acceptance:  ACT uses a variety of acceptance -based metaphors and 87 
experiential exercises to increase awareness and acceptance of unwanted thoughts, feelings, 88 
and sensations  (such as the em otional and/or physical discomfort that may be experienced 89 
during physical activity)  in order to foster the ability to make room for  unpleasant internal 90 
experiences without trying to change or eliminate them  (Hayes et al. , 1999 ; Hayes et al. , 91 
2006; Biglan et al. , 2008) ;  92 
2. Behavioural commitment to valued life -directions:  ACT emphasizes the necessity 93 
of identifying desired life directions (i.e. values) in domains related to health and fitness ( e.g. 94 
maintaining physical independence) in order to motivate en gagement in behaviours that are 95 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 6 - 6 
consistent with those values. ACT also aims to foster the willingness and ability to forego a 96 
behaviour that is perceived as more pleasurable or requires less effort (e.g. sitting on the 97 
couch after dinner and watching TV) i n order to engage in a behaviour that is more consistent 98 
with one's  health and fitness  values  (e.g. going for a walk after dinner) (Hayes et al. , 1999 ; 99 
Hayes et al. , 2006 ; Biglan et al. , 2008) . 100 
 101 
Behaviour Change Techniques (BCT s) – the ‘Active Ingredients’ of Interventions  102 
Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) have been defined as the ‘active ingredients’ 103 
of behaviour change interventions in that they are “ observable, replicable, and irreducible 104 
component[s] of an intervention design ed to alter or redirect causal processes that regulate 105 
behaviour ” (Michie e t al., 2013 , p4). In their development of a  BCT taxonomy  (the 106 
Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1, BCTTv1) , Michie  et al. (2013) identified 107 
93 individual BCTs , which cluster into 16 groups of BCTs.  108 
Although it is considered best  practice to develop behaviour change interventions 109 
based on theory, some previous reviews have demonstrated that, on the whole, physical 110 
activity interventions that are guided by a theory are no more effective that atheoretical 111 
interventions (Conn , Hafdahl, & Mehr, 2011 ; Prestwich et al. , 2014 ; McEwan et al. , 2016 ; 112 
Rhodes , Janssen, Bredin, Warburton, & Bauman,  2017) . One explanation for this h as been 113 
that the main ‘driver’ of behaviour change is the specific BCTs  used in interventions, rather 114 
than the theory upon which the interventions are based (McEwan et al. , 2019) . If this were 115 
the case, theory -based and atheoretical interventions could have similar effects if the same 116 
BCTs were used in both types of intervention (McEwan et al. , 2019). Consequently, it has 117 
been recommended that the specific content of an interventi on (in terms of the included 118 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 7 - 7 
BCTs) is considered when examining the effectiveness of physical activity interventions, in 119 
addition to the underlying theory on which the intervention is based (McEwan et al. , 2019).  120 
The main aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of ACT -based 121 
interventions for physical activity. However, the review is also intended to aid the 122 
development of future ACT interventions for physical activity by describing the current state 123 
of the field and highlighting how ACT theory h as been applied to physical activity. ACT 124 
interventions are typically defined by the theoretical processes of change that they target 125 
(namely, Acceptance ; Defusion ; Contact with the Present Moment ; Self-As-Context ; Values ; 126 
and Committed Action ), rather than being defined by the specific techniques used to target 127 
those processes (Zhang et al., 2018; Hayes et al., 1999; Hayes et al., 2006; Biglan et al., 128 
2008; Hofmann a& Hayes, 2019). Consequently, it is currently unclear how the constructs 129 
and content of ACT  interventions relate to  traditional BCTs (such as self -monitoring, action 130 
planning, etc.) - and hence a key aim of this paper was to identify which ACT processes are 131 
typically targeted by ACT -based interventions  for physical activity , and also identify wh ich 132 
BCTs of the BCTTv1 (Michie et al., 2013) are included in the content of ACT -based 133 
interventions.  134 
To summarise, t he aims of this review were  to: 135 
1. Determine the effectiveness of ACT interventions for physical activity  though a meta - 136 
analysis.  137 
2. Identify the ACT processes targeted by effective interventions  through coding intervention 138 
descriptions and protocols (where available) .  139 
3. Identify the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) included in effective interventions  140 
through coding descriptions and protocols (where available) using the BCTTv1 . 141 
4. Identify other intervention characteristics associated with effective intervention s. 142

Methods  144 
This systematic review followed a protocol registered with PROSPERO (registration 145 
number: CRD42018115730) (Pear s, Sutton, & Griffin,  2018) and used the PRISMA checklist 146 
(provided in Supplementary Document 2) for reporting systematic reviews (Moher , Liberati,  147 
Tetzlaff, & Altman , 2009).  148 
 149 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  150 
Studies were required to meet the following criteria: (i) Randomized  controlled trials 151 
(RCTs) or pre-post designs ; (ii) the intervention was designed to increase physical activity 152 
(interventions target ing multiple health behaviours were excluded); (iii) the study must report 153 
a physical act ivity behaviour outcome (either objective or subjective /self -report); (iv) the 154 
study must include an intervention based on ACT (delivered individually or in a group ; via 155 
single or multiple sessions ; by any provider , including fully -digitized interventions ; in any 156 
setting); (v) the study must target  adult participants (≥18 years); (vi) the study must be 157 
available in English language . 158 
 159 
Search Strategy  160 
Seven electronic databases were searched from 1980 up to June 26th 2018 : 161 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane 162 
Library. Searches were restricted to 1980 or later, as acceptance and commitment therapy 163 
was not developed before 1982. The search strategy was designed and conducted with the 164 
help of a university librarian (IK). The search terms were “acceptance and commitment 165 
therapy” AND “physical activity”. Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement 166 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 9 - 9 
produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure . In daily life , physic al activity  167 
can be categorized into work -related , sports, conditioning, household, or other activities  168 
(Caspersen , Powell & Christenson, 1985) . Associated synonyms were identified and keyword 169 
and subject heading searches were performed. The strategy was ad apted for each database. 170 
The full search strategy for each database can be found in Supplementary Document 3. To 171 
address the grey literature the list published on the ACBS (Association for Contextual 172 
Behavioural Science) website of ACT interventions for ph ysical activity was searched . 173 
Reference lists of included studies were hand searched.  The search was updated on May 29 th, 174 
2019.  175 
 176 
Study Selection  177 
Two reviewers (SP/SS ) independently screened titles and abstracts retrieved by the 178 
search strategy. Full -text articles were then reviewed for eligibility by the same two 179 
reviewers . The first instance where studies did not meet eligibility was recorded, and the 180 
study was not a ssessed for further criteria. The selection of studies was recorded according to 181 
the PRISMA guidelines . Conflicts between reviewers were resolved through discussion 182 
between the two independent reviewers . Cohen's kappa  (κ) was calculated as a measure inter - 183 
rater reliability (Landis & Koch, 1977). Figure 1 shows the study search results and  selection 184 
process.  185 
 186 
Data Extraction  187 
One reviewer (SP) extracted the data into a standardized data extraction form 188 
developed specifically for this review. Data extraction w as veri fied by a second reviewer 189 
(SS). Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion.  190 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 10 - 10 
Data were extracted on:  191 
Study characteristics:  number of participants r andomized ; total number allocated to 192 
each trial arm; setting; design ; trial arms; measurement times; physical activity outcome 193 
measures (objective or self -report); retention (calculated as a percentage of those randomized 194 
to the intervention and completed follow -up assessment) . 195 
Participant characteristics:  age (mean and range);  gender  (% female); populatio n. 196 
Effectiveness of intervention:  mean and standard deviation at baseline, 197 
postintervention, and follow -up for all physical activity outcomes (objective and self -report); 198 
effect size at post assessment and follow up. Where not reported, effect sizes were calculated 199 
based on postintervention and follow -up means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for 200 
each condition to produce standardized mean differences ( SMD ), with 95% confidence 201 
intervals (CIs).  202 
Intervention and Comparator characteristics:  Description  of trial arms ; Delivery 203 
provider; Format; Duration ; Intensity (e.g. number of intervention contacts, duration of 204 
contact s, number of m odules); Materials;  ACT processes;  BCTs.  205 
 206 
Risk of Bias  207 
Two reviewer s (SP and SS ) independently assessed risk of bias using  the revised 208 
Cochrane Risk of Bias T ool 2.0 (Higgins et al. 2016 ). Studies were  coded as low, high or 209 
some concerns  of bias in the following five domains : 1) Risk of bias arising from the 210 
randomization process; 2) Risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions 211 
(effect of assignment to intervention); 3) Risk of bias in m issing outcome data; 4) Risk of 212 
bias in measuremen t of the outcome; 5) Risk of bias in selection of the reported result.  An 213 
overall risk of bias rating of low, high or some concerns  was given to each study based on the 214 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 11 - 11 
following criteria:  Low risk:  Low risk of bias across all domains ; High risk:  High risk  of bias 215 
in at least one domain OR some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially 216 
lowers confidence in the result;  Some concerns : Some concerns in at least one domain, but 217 
not to be at high risk of bias for any domain .  218 
 219 
ACT Processes  220 
Two reviewers (SP/SS) independently coded the ACT processes targeted in the 221 
intervention conditions of the included studies using a fixed -choice format to specify whether 222 
ACT processes were explicitly named (when ACT processes were explicitly n amed in the 223 
manuscript ), identifiable  (when processes could be identified from the intervention 224 
description , protocol or supplementary material , but were not explicitly named) or  absent . 225 
Cohen's kappa  (κ) was calculated as a measure inter -rater reliability ( Landis & Koch, 1977). 226 
Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion.  227 
 228 
BCTs  229 
Two reviewers (SP/SS)  trained in the use of the Behaviour Change Technique 230 
Taxonomy v1 (Michie et al. 2013)  coded the BCTs in the intervention and comparator  231 
conditions of the included studies. Coders independently coded the intervention and 232 
comparator  condition using a fixed -choice format to specify if BCTs were definitely present , 233 
probably present  (when techn iques may have been used but this was uncertain) or definitely 234 
absent . Only BCTs targeting physical activity behaviour of intervention participants were 235 
coded. Cohen's kappa  (κ) was calculated as a measure inter -rater reliability ( Landis & Koch, 236 
1977). Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion.  237 
 238

Statistical analysis  239 
For each study, we included the effect size for a physical outcome measure at the 240 
longest follow -up time -point available, choosing where possible a continuous, objective 241 
measure that best reflected overall physical activity.  242 
A random effects meta -analysis calculated the pooled effect size, using the Chi - 243 
Squared test (Q -Statistic) to test for heterogeneity between studies and the I 2 statistic to 244 
estimate the proportion of variance due to real difference across studies rather than random 245 
error, using the widely used cut offs of 25%, 50% and 75% to represent low, moderate and 246 
high heterogeneity respectively (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). A random 247 
effects meta -regression was planned to examine whether intervention components were 248 
associated with intervention effect. We intended to assess publication bias using funnel plot 249 
techniques, Begg’s rank test and Egger’s regression test, as appropriate given the known 250 
limit ations of these methods (Ruszni Nik Idris, 2012).  251 
 252 
Results  253 
A total of 1686 references were returned from the search strategy after removal of 254 
duplicates (Fig ure 1). Fourteen  articles were identified as potentially relevant, with seven  255 
studies fulfilling all review criteria (Butry n, Forman, Hoffman, Shaw, & Juarascio, 2011; 256 
Ivanova , Yaakoba -Zohar, Jensen, Cassoff, & Knäuper 2016; Kangasniemi , Lappalainen, 257 
Kankaanpää, Tolvanen,  & Tammelin,  2015; Martin , Galloway -Williams, Cox, & Winett, 258 
2016; Moffitt & Mohr , 2015; Fletcher , 2011; Stevens , 2017). Cohen's kappa  (κ) was 0.61 for 259 
title selection, 0.62 for abstract selection and 1 for full -text selection, representing substantial 260 
to perfect agreement.  All seven  included studies focused on physical activity interventions. 261 
None reported on sedentary behaviour.  262

Study characteristics  264 
Table 1 summarises study characteristics. The seven  included papers reported seven  265 
studies, including  seven  ACT -based  interventions. Four  studies were conducted in the USA  266 
(Butryn et al., 2011; Fletcher, 2011; Martin et al., 2016; Stevens, 2017),  one in Canada  267 
(Ivanova et al., 2016) , one in Australia  (Moffitt and Mohr, 2015) , and one in Finland  268 
(Kangasniemi et al., 2015) . One study was set in a university campus  (Butryn et al., 2011) , 269 
one was set in the community  (Martin et al., 2016) , one was  set in a centre fo r nutrition and 270 
metabolism  (Fletcher, 2011) , and for four studies the setting was not specified  (Ivanova et al., 271 
2016; Kangasniemi et al., 2015; Stevens, 2017; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015) . There were six 272 
randomized  controlled trials (RCTs), and one pre -post study  (Martin et al., 2016) . Four 273 
studies compared an ACT intervention with another inte rvention  (Butryn et al., 2011; 274 
Ivanova et al., 2016; Kangasniemi et al., 2015; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015) , one study compared 275 
an ACT intervention with two other interventions (Stevens, 2017) , one study compared an 276 
ACT intervention with a no -treatment (wait -list) control group  (Fletcher, 2011) , and one 277 
study  used a single -arm (pre-post) design  (Martin et al., 2016) . 278 
In total, 526 participants were randomized . Sample size ranged from 28 to 138 279 
(median = 72).  Four of the studies  (Ivanova et al., 2016; Kangasniemi  et al., 2015; Martin et 280 
al., 2016; Stevens, 2017)  recruited healthy adult participants who were ‘low active ’ / 281 
‘inactive ’/ ‘sedentary ’ / ‘insufficiently active ’ (all defined as not currently meeting physical 282 
activity recommendations), one study recruited participants who were low -moderately active  283 
and also in the contemplation or preparation stage of the transtheoretical model  (Moffitt and 284 
Mohr, 2015) , one recrui ted adult participants who had been or were currently enrolled in a 285 
weight loss programme and were interested in increasing their physical activity  (Fletcher, 286 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 14 - 14 
2011) , and one study recruited health y college students  (Butryn et al., 2011) . Mean age of 287 
partic ipants ranged from 22.4yrs to 52.6yrs (median = 43.5yrs). Three studies recruited only 288 
female participants  (Butryn et al., 2011; Ivanova et al., 2016; Stevens, 2017) , in the 289 
remaining four studies ≥79% of participants were female.  Time  to final follow -up, measured 290 
from randomisation or baseline measurement,  varied from 8 weeks to 6 months (median = 3 291 
months ).  292 
Measurement of p hysical activity behaviour  varied greatly. Physical activity  293 
behaviour was  objectively measured  in five  studies (one study measured number of visits to 294 
an athletic centre  (Butryn et al., 2011) ; one used an A ctigraph  to measure minutes of physical 295 
activity per day  (Kangasniemi et al., 2015) ; one estimated cardio -respiratory fitnes s as a 296 
proxy measure of phys ical activity  (Martin et al., 2016) ; one used a pedometer to measure 297 
step count  (Moffitt and Mohr, 2015) ; and one used a heart -rate monitor  to measure total 298 
minutes of physical activity over 30 days  (Stevens, 2017) ). Physical activity  behaviour w as 299 
estimat ed by self -report in five  studies (one study assessed  hours per week of exercise using 300 
the Godin Leisure -Time Exercise Questionnaire (Ivanova et al., 2016) ; two assessed  MET - 301 
minutes using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire  (Fletcher, 2011; Mo ffitt and 302 
Mohr, 2015) ; two assessed minutes o f physical activity with 7 -day recall  (Kangasniemi et al., 303 
2015; Stevens, 2017) ; and one used The Voluntary Exercise Questionnaire to assess 304 
voluntary exercise behaviour over the past month  (Stevens, 2017) ). Retention at follow -up 305 
ranged from 68% -100% (mean =82.6%) in the intervention trial arms; and from 71 -95% 306 
(mean = 84.7%) in the comparator trial arms.  307 
Overall risk of bias  (Figure 2) was high for all seven  studies . Five of the six RCTs 308 
were coded as being at high risk of bias in missing outcome data  (Fletcher, 2011; Ivanova et 309 
al., 2016; Kangasniemi et al., 2015; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015; Stevens, 2017) . All six RCTs 310 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 15 - 15 
were  coded as having some co ncerns in the domain of selection of the repo rted result. Risk of 311 
bias could not be  coded for the pre -post study  (Martin et al., 2016) , but overall risk was 312 
judged  to be high, given the lack of a control.  313 
 314 
Intervention Characteristics  315 
Table 2 shows the intervention characteristics, ACT Processes and BCTs present in 316 
the intervention and comparator trial arms for each of the seven studies. The ACT -based 317 
intervention was delivered by the lead author (an ACT interventionist) in one study (Ivanova 318 
et al.,  2016 ),  by clinicians or students trained in the delivery of ACT in four studies (Butryn 319 
et al. , 2011; Kangasniemi et al. , 2015; Fletcher , 2011; Stevens , 2017) , and two studies 320 
(Martin et al. , 2016; Moffitt and Mohr , 2015)  did not specify who delivered t he intervention. 321 
ACT intervention delivery had a face -to-face component in six studies  (Butryn et al. , 2011; 322 
Ivanova et al., 2016 ; Kangasniemi et al., 2015 ; Martin et al., 2016 ; Fletcher, 2011 ; Stevens, 323 
2017 ) and was delivered via a self -managed DVD in one  study  (Moffitt and Mohr, 2015 ). 324 
Two of the studies with a face -to-face component delivered the ACT intervention in a single, 325 
individual session lasting 40 -60minutes (Ivanova et al., 2016 ; Stevens, 2017 ). The remaining 326 
four studies with a face -to-face component delivered the ACT intervention in a group setting, 327 
with durations ranging from a single six -hour session (Fletcher, 2011 ) to eight 90 -minute 328 
sessions over 10 weeks (Martin et al., 2016 ).  In three  studies, the intervention condition was 329 
an ACT intervention focusing on physical activity (Butryn et al., 2011 ; Ivanova et al., 2016 ; 330 
Fletcher, 2011 ). In the four remaining studies, an ACT intervention was combined with 331 
additional  intervention components – self-monitoring with a pedometer plus feedback on 332 
current physical activity  (Kangasniemi et al., 2015 ), a walking programme (Martin et al., 333 
2016 ), and exercise prescription (Stevens, 2017 ).   334 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 16 - 16 
Comparator  conditions varied, including education on physical a ctivity (Butryn et al., 335 
2011 ; Stevens, 2017 ), mailed feedback on physical activity (Kangasniemi et al., 2015 ), 336 
implementation intentions (Ivanova et al., 2016 ), a pedometer -based walking programme  337 
(Moffitt and Mohr, 2015 ), exercise prescription (Stevens, 2017 ), and wait -list control 338 
(Fletcher, 2011 ).   339 
 340 
ACT Processes  341 
The number and name of  ACT processes present in each of the ACT interventions  are 342 
reported in Table 2. On average, the number of ACT processes (including Crea tive 343 
Hopelessness ) targeted by ACT interventions was 5.7 (range 5 -7). Cohen's kappa  (κ) was 344 
calculated for each ACT process and ranged from 0.59 (for  Contact -with-the-Present - 345 
Moment ) to 1 (for Acceptance, Self -As-Context, and Values ), representing moderate to perfect 346 
agreement between raters . Table 3 shows the total number of studies targeting each of the 347 
ACT processes.  Of the six core ACT processes, Defusion , Values  and Committed Action  were 348 
targeted by the ACT intervention in all s even  studies, Acceptance  was targeted in six studies 349 
(Butryn et al., 2011; Fletcher, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2016; 2015; Martin et al., 2016; Moffitt 350 
and Mohr, 2015; Stevens, 2017); Contact -with-the-Present -Momen t was targeted in six  351 
studies  (Butryn et al., 2011; Fletcher, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2016; Kangasniemi et al., 2015; 352 
Martin et al., 2016; Stevens, 2017) , and Self-As-Context  was targeted in three studies  353 
(Fletcher, 2011; Kangasniemi et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2016;) . Creative Hopelessness  was 354 
target ed by the ACT intervention in four studies  (Butryn et al., 2011; Fletcher, 2011; Ivanova 355 
et al., 2016; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015).  356 
Three of the seven studies  (Martin et al., 2016; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015; Stevens, 357 
2017)  explicitly named all processes targeted. In the remaining four studies, the number of 358 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 17 - 17 
processes that were identifiable but not explicitly named ranged from one (two studies , 359 
Butryn et al., 2011;  Fletcher, 2011 ) to four (one study , Ivanova et al., 2016 ) (Table 2). Self- 360 
as-Context (SAC)  and Creative Hopelessness (CH) were more commonly identifiable but not 361 
explicitly named –SAC was targeted in three studies (Fletcher, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2016; 362 
Kangasniemi et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2016) but only explicitly named in one  (Martin et al., 363 
2016;) , and CH was targeted in four studies  (Butryn et al., 2011; Fletcher, 2011; Ivanova et 364 
al., 2016; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015)  but only explicitly named in two (Fletcher, 2011; Moffitt 365 
and Mohr, 2015) . No ACT processes were targeted in the comparator interventions.  366 
 367 
BCTs  (Behaviour change techniques ) Applied in Intervention and Comparator  groups  368 
The number and name of BCTs present in each of the intervention and comparator 369 
conditions are reported in Table 2. On average, the number of BCTs was greater in the 370 
intervention condition (mean of 7.0; range 0-11) than in the comparator condition (mean of 371 
4.5; range 2 -7) (Table 2). In four of the six studies with a comparator group  (Fletcher, 2011; 372 
Kangasniemi et al., 2015; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015; Stevens, 2017) , the number of BCTs was 373 
greater in the intervention condition than in the comparator condition  and was equivalent in 374 
both conditions in one study (Ivanova et al., 2016 ). The number of BCTs was greater in the 375 
comparator condition than in the intervention condition in the one study in which the ACT 376 
intervention was identified as very promising  (Butryn et al., 2011 ).   377 
Table 4 shows the total number of studies with BCTs present ( and probably present) 378 
in the intervention and comparator conditions . Overall, there were 22 different BCTs (out of a 379 
possible 93) identified in the seven studies – 20 diff erent BCTs were identified across the 380 
intervention conditions (ACT intervention plus Additional Components) and 17 different 381 
BCTs were identified across the comparator conditions. Cohen's kappa  (κ) could not be 382 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 18 - 18 
calculated for 61 BCTs as both raters agreed that these were not included in any of the 383 
studies. For the 20 BCTs identified across the intervention conditions (ACT intervention plus 384 
Additional Components), Cohen's kappa  (κ) ranged from 0. 7 to 1 representing substantial  to 385 
perfect agreement between raters. For the 17 BCTs identified across the comparator 386 
conditions, Cohen's kappa  (κ) ranged from 0.46 to 1 representing moderate to perfect 387 
agreement between raters.  388 
 389 
BCTs in  the intervention  condition : ACT intervention . 390 
There were  ten different BCTs across all ACT interventions  (excluding any additional 391 
components)  (Table  4) with a mean of 2.6 (range 0 -4) BCTs per intervention.  The m ost 392 
common  BCTs were  1.2 Problem solving , 1.3 Goal Setting (outcome)  and 1.9 Commitment  393 
(all of which w ere identified in 3 of the 7 ACT interventions) . The BCTs 1.4 Action 394 
Planning , and 5.4 Monitoring of emotional consequences  were identified in 2 of the 7 ACT 395 
interventions. The remaining five BCTs were identified in only one of the seven ACT 396 
interventions.   397 
In all six studies with a comparator, the comparator intervention contained more 398 
BCTs (mean = mean of 4.5; range 2 -7) than the ACT intervention (mean = 2.8; range 0 -4). 399 
Five BCTs were unique to the ACT intervention (not present in the addit ional components or 400 
comparator  intervention ): 1.7 Review outcome goal(s)   (probably present in one intervention , 401 
(Kangasniemi et al., 2015 ), 1.9 Commitment  (present in two interventions  (Fletcher, 2011; 402 
Stevens, 2017) , probably present in one intervention  (Moffitt and Mohr, 2015) ), 5.4 403 
Monitoring of emotional consequences  (present in two interventions  (Martin et al., 2016; 404 
Stevens, 2017) ), 5.6 Information about emotional consequences   (present in one intervention  405 
(Fletcher, 2011) ), 15.4 Self -talk (probably present in one intervention  (Ivanova et al., 2016) ). 406 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 19 - 19 
BCTs in  the intervention  condition: additional components . 407 
There were  14 different BCTs across the additional components (that were combined 408 
with the ACT intervention) (Table 4) with a mean of  6.2 (range 4 -8) BCTs per intervention - 409 
this included one study (Fletcher, 2011 ) in which additional BCTs were identifiable as 410 
probably present in the weight loss programme from which participants were recruited. The 411 
most common BCTs were 1.1 Goal Setting (behaviour) , 1.4 Action Planning , 2.3 Self - 412 
monitoring of behaviour and 12.5 Addin g objects to the environment  (all of which were 413 
identified in 4 of the 4 interventions that combined ACT with additional components  414 
(Kangasniemi et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2016; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015; Stevens, 2017) ). The 415 
remaining ten BCTs were identif ied as additional components in only 1-2 of the  seven 416 
studies .  No BCTs were unique to the additional components (not present in the ACT 417 
intervention or comparator intervention).  418 
BCTs in comparator  condition . 419 
Seventeen  different BCTs  were present or probably present  across the comparator 420 
interventions (Table 4) with a mean of 4.5 (range 2 -7) BCTs per intervention - again  this 421 
included one study (Fletcher, 2011 ) in which BCTs were identifiable as probably present in 422 
the weight loss pro gramme from which participants were recruited. The most common BCTs 423 
were 1.1 Goal Setting (behaviour) , 1.4 Action Planning , and 2.3 Self -monitoring of behaviour  424 
(all of which were identified in 4 of 7 studies ). The remaining fourteen  BCTs were identified 425 
in the comparator  intervention of only 1 -2 of the seven studies . Two BCTs were unique to the 426 
comparator  intervention  (not present in the ACT interven tion or additional components): 1.5 427 
Review behaviour goal(s)  (probably present in one intervention , (Stevens, 2017) ), 10.9. Self - 428 
reward  (probabl y present in one intervention , (Stevens, 2017) ). 429

Statistical analysis  431 
Table 5 reports the physical activity outcome s for each study (outcomes included in 432 
the meta -analysis are underlined). Six studies were included in the random effects meta - 433 
analysis, four studies reported an objective measure of physical activity (Butryn et al., 2011; 434 
Kangasniemi  et al., 2015; Martin et al., 2016; Stevens, 2017) , two studies reported only self - 435 
report measures of physical activity ( Fletcher, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2016) . One study (Martin, 436 
2015) was excluded from the statistical analysis because it was a pre -post st udy with no 437 
control group.  438 
The ACT -based physical activity interventions had a large, statistically significant 439 
effect on physical activity behaviour, (SMD=1.21, 95% CI (0.16, 2.26), p=0.02). (Figure 3). 440 
The Chi -square test indicates that statistically si gnificant heterogeneity is present among 441 
studies (x 2=104.39, p<0.00001) to a high degree (I 2=95%). After removing 1 outlier 442 
(Fletcher, 2011), there was no significant heterogeneity present among the remaining five  443 
studies (x 2=4.79, p=0.31; I 2=17%), and ACT -based physical activity interventions had a 444 
small -to-moderate, statistically significant effect on physical activity behaviour, (SMD=0.32, 445 
95% CI (0.07, 0.57), p=0.01). (Figure 4). There were an insufficient number of studies to run 446 
the planned meta -regre ssion. Publication bias was not assessed as there were inadequate 447 
numbers of included trials to properly assess a funnel plot or more advanced regression -based 448 
assessments.  449

Discussion  451 
The Effectiveness of ACT Interventions for Physical Activity  452 
The main aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of ACT -based 453 
interventions for physical activity. Seven studies , including six RCTs,  reporting seven ACT - 454 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 21 - 21 
based interventions were identified . After the removal of one outlier, t he meta -analysis 455 
showed a significant, small -to-moderate  effect of  ACT -based interventions  on physical 456 
activity. Given the high risk of bias across all  seven studies,  the heterogeneity in physical 457 
activity outcome measures , as well as intervention  and comparator characteris tics, this 458 
finding should be interpreted with caution . Nevertheless, the results of this meta -analysis 459 
show promising results for ACT -based physical activity interventions.  460 
 461 
ACT Processes Targeted by ACT -interventions  for Physical Activity  462 
Three ACT processes Defusion , Values  and Committed Action  were targeted by ACT - 463 
based interventions in all seven of the identified studies , while Acceptance  and Contact -with- 464 
the-Present -Moment  were targeted in six studies. Despite not being one of the six c ore ACT 465 
processes, Creative Hopelessness  was targeted by the ACT intervention in four studies, 466 
whereas Self-As-Context  (which is a core ACT process) was targeted in only three studies.  467 
Given the low number of ACT -based intervention studies , that all studie s targeted at least 468 
five of the seven ACT processes, and that in four studies the ACT intervention was combined 469 
with additional intervention components, it is not possible to speculate about which ACT 470 
processes might be associated with effective interventi ons.  471 
However, the following points are worth noting: (1) Only three of the seven studies 472 
explicitly named all processes targeted ; in the remaining four studies some processes were 473 
identif iable but not explicitly named . For transparency, ease of replication and interpretation 474 
of findings, future studies should explicitly name processes targeted; (2) No reasons were 475 
given for why certain processes were targeted and others were not . Given the synergistic 476 
nature of the ACT processes (inter -related an d over-lapping processes)  (Hayes et al. 1999; 477 
Hayes et al. 2006 ) future studies should  report  the theoretical rational e for targeting some 478 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 22 - 22 
ACT processes and not others ; (3) It is interesting that the least commonly targeted process , 479 
Self-As-Context , is als o the process that is notoriously difficult to understand conceptually, 480 
and one that practitioners often report that they struggle to address in practice (Westrup and 481 
Wright 201 7). This raises the question of whether a process that is considered to be cent ral to 482 
the ACT model is often left out of interventions because intervention developers find it too 483 
tricky to incorporate , or whether the process is difficult to identify when it is not explicitly 484 
named as a targeted process;  (4) As already mentioned, in f our of the seven studies , the ACT 485 
intervention was combined with additional intervention components such as feedback on 486 
current physical activity (Kangasniemi et al., 2015 ), a walking programme  (Martin et al., 487 
2016 ; Moffitt and Mohr, 2015 ), and exercise prescription  (Stevens, 2017 ). To appropriately 488 
examine the effectiveness of ACT -based interventions  for physical activity , we would 489 
recommend that future studies include an ‘ACT -only’ intervention condition that includes no 490 
additional intervention  components.    491 
 492 
Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs)  Present in ACT  Interventions for Physical Activity  493 
Given that ACT processes are theoretical constructs, not intervention techniques, no 494 
BCTs could be identified in an interven tion based on the process name (e.g. Acceptance ) 495 
alone. Instead, BCTs could only be identified from intervention descriptions (Butryn et al., 496 
2011 ; Ivanova et al., 2016 ; Kangasniemi et al., 2015 ; Martin et al., 2016 ; Moffitt and Mohr, 497 
2015 ; Fletcher, 2011 ; Stevens, 2017 ), protocols (Ivanova et al., 2016 ; Fletcher, 2011 ) or 498 
fidelity checklists  (Stevens, 2017 ). However , much of the intervention content did not fall 499 
into the existing BCTTv1 categories – on average over the seven studies, ACT -based 500 
intervention s for physical activity included only 2.6 BCTs per intervention. This number is 501 
surprisingly low for a physical activity intervention, especially one that is theory -based ; a 502 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 23 - 23 
recent meta -analysis of physical activity interventions for healthy inactive adult s (Howlett et 503 
al. 2019) found that the 26 included interventions contained an avera ge of 8.4 BCTs . One 504 
explanation for the finding of the low number of BCTs in ACT interventions for physical 505 
activity is that four of the seven ACT interventions in this review were combined with 506 
additional components, and that when considered together, the overa ll intervention (ACT + 507 
additional components) , the average number of BCTs was much higher at 7.0 BCTs per 508 
intervention.  Alternatively, it is possible that , as five  of the seven studies did not include an 509 
intervention protocol or fidelity checklist, BCT content could only be coded from  510 
intervention descriptions  in the main text, and these descriptions may have been insufficient 511 
to identify the full number of BCTs in these interventions.  This explanation is potentially 512 
unlikely, however, as  the average number of BCTs identified in the comparator conditions of 513 
the current review (mean = 4.5 BCTs) is very similar to that of Howlett et al.  (2019) , who 514 
identified a n averag e of 5.1 BCTs in comparator conditions . Furthermore, only 2 -4 BCTs 515 
were identified in the ACT interventions for which  full protocols (Ivanova et al., 2016 ; 516 
Fletcher, 2011 ) or a comprehensive fidelity checklist (Stevens, 2017 ) were published . 517 
An alternative explanation for these findings is that ACT interventions contain very 518 
little in t he way of ‘active ingredients’  as currently recognised  and defined  by the BCTTv1.  519 
This explanation m ay be plausible given that the model of behaviour change  (psych ological 520 
flexibility) and the behaviour  change processes ( acceptance , defusion , contact -with-the- 521 
present -moment , self-as-context , values , and committed action ) that underlie  ACT are 522 
relatively new in the field of behaviour change, having only been around for the last two - 523 
three decades (Hayes et al. , 1999; Hayes et al. , 2006).  524 
Interestingly, three of the five BCTs  identified  in this current review  as being unique 525 
to the ACT intervention (1.9 Commitment , 5.4 Monit oring of emotional consequences , 5.6 526 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 24 - 24 
Information about emotional consequences ) were not implemented in any of the 26 physical 527 
activity interventions included in Howlett et al.’s review . Furthermore,  Howlett et al . (2019) 528 
found that the most frequently used  BCTs  in physical activi ty interventions were 1.1 Goal 529 
setting (b ehaviour ) (22 studies) and  3.1 Social support (unspecified)  (20 studies) – neither of 530 
which were included in any of the ACT interventions in the current review.  Together, these 531 
findings again could be seen to point to the possibility that interventions based on ACT (and 532 
the psychological flexibility model) may inc lude atypical BCTs (perhaps even some not 533 
currently included in the BCTTv1) because they target unique behaviour change processes 534 
not present in other models of behaviour change.  However, it is important to note that goal - 535 
setting as a technique can be (and  often is) used to target the Committed Action process of 536 
the psychological flexibility model (Hayes et al., 2006).  Given that ACT interventions are 537 
often defined in terms of the behaviour change processes they target, rather than the 538 
individual techniques  used to target those processes, i t is possible that the ACT interventions 539 
included in this review may have included goal -setting, but that this BCT could not be 540 
identified from intervention descriptions, protocols, or fidelity checklists.  541 
If ACT interven tions do indeed contain ‘active ingredients’, and many of these are not 542 
currently included in the BCTTv1, we would recommend that  future work focus on 543 
identifying what techniques are typically employed by ACT interventions, and ultimately aim 544 
to determine whether these techniques meet the criteria for inclusion in the BCTTv1 – 545 
namely that they : 546 
(a) aim to change b ehaviour , (b) are proposed “active ingredients” of 547 
interventions, (c) are the smallest components compatible with retaining the 548 
proposed  active ingredients, (d) can be used alone or in combination with other 549 
BCTs, (e) are observable and replicable, (f) can have a measurable effect on a 550 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 25 - 25 
specified b ehaviour /s, and (g) may or may not have an established empirical 551 
evidence base . (Michie et al ., 2013, p84 ).  552 
Steven Hayes, who developed ACT, has often highlighted that although many of the 553 
techniques in ACT are relatively distinct, many are also shared with other approaches, 554 
particularly cognitive -behavioural  approaches, and he has emphasised that it is important not 555 
to view ACT simply as a collection of techniques, but instead as  “a perspective into which a 556 
wide variety of [techniques], some identified with ACT and some not, can be deployed in a 557 
coherent fas hion linked to basic principles ” (Hayes et al. , 2013, p9 ). ACT is a ‘process -based 558 
therapy’ (Hofmann & Hayes , 2019) and the goal of any ACT intervention (whether it’s 559 
applied to health behaviour, mental health, or any other area) is to effect change the six core 560 
processes (i.e. to increase psychological flexibility) in order to ultimately bring about a 561 
change in behavi our (Hayes et al. , 2013, p9 ). Furthermore, Hayes et al. (2013) have 562 
speculated that understanding what techniques are effective is impossible without first 563 
understanding behaviour change processes (Hayes et al., 2013), and Michie and Johnston 564 
(2012) have h ighlighted the need for “ linking active ingredients to an understanding of the 565 
processes involved, that is, to the theoretical basis of behaviour change ” (Michie & Johnston, 566 
2012, p4). Consequently, in order to link the active ingredients of ACT interventi ons with the 567 
underlying psychological flexibility model of behaviour change, we would also recommend 568 
that researchers aim to clearly identify which specific techniques they have included in ACT 569 
interventions (whether these BCTs are included in the BCTTv1 o r not) and link these 570 
techniques to the  behaviour change processes they are intended to change.   571 
 572 
Other Intervention Character istics  573 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 26 - 26 
It is well known that intervention effectiveness may depend not only the specific 574 
content of the intervention, but also on other intervention characteristics such as how it is 575 
delivered, by whom, to whom, in that format, with what intensity, and for how lo ng 576 
(Davidson et al., 2003 ).  Again, there was an insufficient number of studies in the current 577 
review to draw any conclusions about which of these characteristics may or may not be  578 
associated with the effectiveness of ACT interventions for physical activit y. Nonetheless, it is 579 
perhaps useful to note that ACT interventions for physical activity: (i) have mostly been 580

(iii) can be delivered with  a wide range of intensities and durations  from as little as a single 584

Strengths and Limitations  586 
A robust methodological approach and adherence to a published protocol and 587 
PRISMA are strengths of this review. The use of the BCTTv1 (Michie et al. , 2013) allowed a 588 
thorough analysis of intervention component s included in ACT intervention s, and to the 589 
authors ’ knowledge this is the first time ACT intervention content in any field has been coded 590 
using the BCTTv1.  591 
Several of the limitations of this review are a consequence of  methodological 592 
weaknesses of the in cluded studies , but also represent opportunities for future research.  First,  593 
measurement of physical act ivity behaviour varied greatly, and only four of the six RCTs 594 
included an objective measure of physical activity. We echo previous calls for future research 595 
to standardize measurement of physical activity so that data can be pooled more meaningfully 596 
(Autier & Pizot,  2016; Howlett et al. , 2019).  597 
ACT INTERVENTIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  
 - 27 - 27 
A second limitation was that  included studies were limited by small sample sizes 598 
(with all but one study having fewer  than 100 participants), and a predominance of female 599 
participants. Given that the findings of this review add to the growing body of evidence that 600 
ACT -based intervention s have shown promise for promoting a range of health behaviours 601 
including physical activity, we would recommend that future research focuses on exploring 602 
the effectiveness of ACT for physical activity in large -scale, randomized  controlled trials. 603 
Although the predominance of female participants is typical of health behaviour research 604 
samples, with males comprising about 20% of samples (Ryan  et al.,  2019), future research 605 
should attempt to explore ways to increase  recru itment of male participants, either in mixed - 606 
gender or single -gender studies . 607 
Finally, in all four studies where additional components were added to the ACT 608 
interventions, the additional components contained more BCTs ( identified  using the 609 
BCTTv1) than the  ACT intervention itself. Additionally, in all six studies with a comparator, 610 
the comparator intervention contained more BCTs (as identifiable using the BCTTv1) than 611 
the ACT intervention. The addition of ‘active ingredients’ to many of the ACT intervention , 612 
along with the high number of ‘active ingredients’ in the comparator conditions consequently 613 
reduces the ability to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of ACT interventions for 614 
increasing physical activity. We would recommend that future research : (i) minimise (ideally 615 
to zero) the number of active ingredients in a control comparator condition ; (ii) explore the 616 
effectiveness of ACT interventions delivered with and  without additional intervention 617 
components  (such as the addition of a pedometer, a walking programme, implementation 618 
intentions, etc ); (iii) clearly describe and name the behaviour change processes and 619 
techniques used in ACT interventions, where possible using the standardised terminology of 620 
the Behaviour Change Technique Ta xonomy v1 (Michie et al., 2013), and highlighting where 621

necessary when the ‘active ingredients’ / b ehaviour  change techniques used are not part of the 622 
existing taxonomy.  623 
Conclusions  624 
ACT  interventions show promise for increasing physical activity b ehaviour , but as yet 625 
no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the most effective intervention components 626 
or characteristics. Future de velopment of ACT interventions  for physical activity should 627 
attempt to describe  and name the ACT processes targeted by the intervention, and the 628 
behaviour  change techniques used to target those processes. Future trials should employ more 629 
high-quality study designs, with larger sample sizes, longer -term follow -ups, and use a 630 
standardised, objective measure of physical activity .  631

*Where possible effect sizes were calculated based on postintervention and follow -up means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for each condition to produce standardized mean differences ( SMD)  with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). Positive effect  sizes indicated favourable changes in the ACT intervention groups, compared to the comparator groups. Effect sizes of >0.2, > 0.5 and >0.8 represent small, medium and large 
effects, respectively .  X = unable to calculate effect size.  Outcomes  included in the meta -analysis are underlined.

Supplementary Document  1: The Interacting Psychological Skills/  Processes Identified in the ACT Transdiagnostic Model of Psychological 
Flexibility (Hayes et al. 1999)  
PROCESS  DEFINITION  (HAYES ET AL . 2016)  
Acceptance / 
Willingness 
(A)  “Acceptance is taught as an alternative to experiential avoidance. Acceptance involves the active and aware embrace of those 
private events occasioned by one’s history without unnecessary attempts to change their frequency or form, especially when 
doing so  would cause psychological harm. For example, anxiety patients are taught to feel anxiety, as a feeling, fully and 
without defense; pain patients are given methods that encourage them to let go of a struggle with pain, and so on.”  
Defusion (D)   “Cognitive defusion techniques attempt to alter the undesirable functions of thoughts and other private events, rather than 
trying to alter their form, frequency or situational sensitivity. Said another way, ACT attempts to change the way one intera cts 
with or relates to thoughts by creating contexts in which their unhelpful functions are diminished. For example, a negative 
thought could be watched dispassionately, a person could thank their mind for such an interesting thought, label the process of 
thinkin g (“I am having the thought that I am no good”), or examine the historical thoughts, feelings, and memories that occur 
while they experience that thought.”  
Contact with 
the Present 
Moment 
(CPM)   “ACT promotes ongoing non -judgmental contact with psychological and environmental events as they occur. The goal is to 
have clients experience the world more directly so that their behavior is more flexible and thus their actions more consisten t 
with the v alues that they hold. A sense of self called “self as process” is actively encouraged: the defused, non -judgmental 
ongoing description of thoughts, feelings, and other private events.”  
Self-as-
Context 
(SAC)   “”I” emerges over large sets of exemplars of pe rspective -taking relations (what are termed in RFT “deictic relations”), but 
since this sense of self is a context for verbal knowing, not the content of that knowing, it’s limits cannot be consciously 
known. Self as context is important in part because fr om this standpoint, one can be aware of one’s own flow of experiences 
without attachment to them or an investment in which particular experiences occur: thus defusion and acceptance is fostered. 
Self as context is fostered in ACT by mindfulness exercises, metaphors, and experiential processes.”  
Values (V)   “Values are chosen qualities of purposive action that can never be obtained as an object but can be instantiated moment by 
moment. ACT uses a variety of exercises to help a client choose life directions in various domains (e.g. family, career, 
spirituality) while undermining verbal processes that might lead to choices based on avoidance, social compliance, or fusion 
(e.g. “I should value X” or “A good person would value Y” or “My mother wants me to value Z”).”  
Committed 
Action (CA)   “Finally, ACT encourages the development of larger and larger patterns of effective action linked to chosen values. In this 
regard, ACT looks very much like traditional behavior therapy, and almost any behaviorally coherent be havior change method 
can be fitted into an ACT protocol, including exposure, skills acquisition, shaping methods, goal setting, and the like. Unli ke 
values, which are constantly instantiated but never achieved as an object, concrete goals that are values c onsistent can be 
achieved and ACT protocols almost always involve therapy work and homework linked to short, medium, and long -term 
behavior change goals.”  
Creative 
Hopelessness 
(CH) **  “Purpose:  To notice that there is a control  agenda in place and notice the basic unworkability of that system; to name the 
system as inappropriately applied control strategies; to examine why this does not work . Method:  Draw out what things the 
client has tried to make things better, examine whethe r or not they have truly worked in the client’s experience, and create 
space for something new to happen.  When to use:  As a precursor to the rest of the work in order for new responses to emerge, 
especially when the client is really struggling. ”
