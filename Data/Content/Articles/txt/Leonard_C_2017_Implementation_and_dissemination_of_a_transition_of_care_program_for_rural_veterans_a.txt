Abstract
Background: Adapting promising health care interventions to local s ettings is a critical component in the dissemination
and implementation process. The Veterans Health Adminis tration (VHA) rural transitions nurse program (TNP) is a
nurse-led, Veteran-centered intervention designed to improv e transitional care for rural Veterans funded by VA national
offices for dissemination to other VA sites serving a predominantly rural Veteran population. Here, we describe our novel
approach to the implementation and evaluation = the TNP.
Methods: This is a controlled before and after study that assesses both implementation and intervention outcomes.
During pre-implementation , we assessed site context using a mixed method approach with data from diverse
sources including facility-level quantitative data, key informant and Veteran interviews, observations of the
discharge process, and a group brainstorming activity. We used the Practical Robust Implementation and
Sustainability Model (PRISM) to inform our inquiries, to integrate data from all sources, and to identify factors
that may affect implementation. In the implementation phase , we will use internal and external facilitation,
paired with audit and feedback, to encourage appropriate contextual adaptations. We will use a modified
Stirman framework to document adaptations. During the evaluation phase , we will measure intervention and
implementation outcomes at each site using the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,
and Maintenance). We will conduct a difference-in-differences analysis with propensity-matched Veterans and VA
facilities as a control. Our primary intervention outcome is 30-day readmission and Emergency Department visit rates.
We will use our findings to develop an implementation toolkit that will inform the larger scale-up of the TNP across
the VA.
Discussion: The use of PRISM to inform pre-implementation evaluation and synthesize data from multiple sources,
coupled with internal and external facilitation, is a novel approach to engaging sites in adapting interventions while
promoting fidelity to the intervention. Our application of PRISM to pre-implementation and midline evaluation, as well
as documentation of adaptations, provides an opportunity to identify and address contextual factors that may impede
or enhance implementation and sustainability of health interventions and inform dissemination.

Background
Patients are at high risk for adverse events during the
transition period from hospital to home [1, 2]. The tran-
sition home presents challenges such as adjusting to
new or changed medications, understanding disease
management strategies, and learning home care rou-
tines. “Bridging ”(i.e., pre- and post-discharge) interven-
tions to improve transitional care practices reduce
hospital readmissions [3]. These interventions focus on
creating an “ideal ”transition of care, which includes pre-
paring patients for discharge with thorough education
about self-care, ensuring the completion of medication
reconciliation, arranging for any home care needs, and
organizing appropriate follow-up [3 –9]. Improving the
transition from hospital to home is especially important
in high-risk cohorts [3, 10], such as the elderly or those
who live in a rural setting.
Rural Veterans are a high-risk cohort as they face bar-
riers in nearly all aspects of an ideal transition in care.
One such barrier relates to the structure of the Veterans
Health Administration (VA) healthcare system. The VA is
organized in a hub and spoke system, with large hospitals
in urban areas and affiliated smaller clinics in rural areas.
This structure leads to unique challenges for rural Vet-
erans transitioning back to their primary care provider,
such as difficulties with medication reconciliation between
VA facilities, medication gaps due to limited availability of
specialized medications in rural areas, inadequate dis-
charge plans, lack of communication between tertiary hos-
pitals and rural Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) sites,
and missed follow-up appointments with primary care
providers (PCPs) [11]. In this paper, we describe the
dissemination and implementation plan for the rural
Transitions Nurse Program (TNP), a nurse-led and
Veteran-centered intervention designed to address these
transitional care gaps and improve post-discharge out-
comes for rural Veterans hospitalized at tertiary VA sites.
The dual goals of this project are to (1) improve transi-
tions and reduce hospital readmissions for rural Veterans
hospitalized at tertiary VA facilities, and (2) contribute to
the field of implementation science through a robust ap-
plication of the PRISM framework at every stage from
pre-implementation contextual assessment, to implemen-
tation and adaptation, to evaluation. The PRISM frame-
work has been used to assess site context in a number of
studies [12, 13], but to our knowledge, it has not been
used to organize and integrate data from multiple sources
or in an iterative manner to guide implementation and
evaluation in successive waves. This work will address a
gap in the literature on the use of PRISM to guide
implementation. It will test the utility of PRISM to
guide scale-up efforts of an intervention to diverse
settings and provide an example of an innovative dif-
fusion process in the VA.Methods
Description of intervention
The TNP is an intervention carried out with a Transition
Nurse (TN) in collaboration with a hospitalist site cham-
pion at each intervention site. The intervention is based
on the Ideal Transitions of Care (ITC) framework [3]
and consists of four core components. These are (1) pre-
discharge assessment of patient understanding of self-
care, medications, supports for post-discharge care, and
obtaining a follow-up appointment; (2) structured post-
discharge interactive communication between the hos-
pital and primary care team alerting the primary care
team of discharge; (3) a follow-up call to the patient
within 48 to 72 h of discharge to confirm attendance to
the follow-up appointment with the PCP, reinforce
medication and self-care education provided at dis-
charge, and assess symptoms and concerns; and (4) build
knowledge and capacity at both the tertiary and primary
care site to deliver improved care to future rural Vet-
erans. The TNP was piloted in Denver between 2014
and 2016 with encouraging results such as reduced hos-
pital readmissions and reduced costs relative to a control
population [11]. Based on the success of the pilot, the
TNP was funded by the VA Office of Rural Health with
the support of the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) Office of Nursing Services for expansion to
additional tertiary VA sites over the next 5 years.
Intervention and study design
We will use the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and
Sustainability (PRISM) model [14] to inform the both
implementation and evaluation of TNP. PRISM is ideal
for guiding our multi-site implementation effort because
it accounts for multi-level effects; it builds on several
Implementation Science frameworks and can guide pre-
implementation, implementation, and evaluation. Several
studies show that the adoption, implementation, and
sustainment of interventions are related to how well the
intervention is integrated into the local context [12 –16].
We will assess PRISM domains using convergent mixed
methods, collecting both quantitative facility-level data,
and qualitative data. We will use PRISM in each phase
of our intervention: pre-implementation, implementa-
tion, and evaluation. Figure 1 shows the flow of project
phases.
This is a type II hybrid study, which tests both inter-
vention outcomes and the implementation strategy [17].
TNP implementation will occur in waves, enrolling addi-
tional sites every 12 months. Each wave of implementation
will follow three stages: pre-implementation training and
evaluation, implementation, and outcome evaluation. It is
important to distinguish the evaluation components of
pre-implementation and implementation from the final
outcome evaluation. Pre-implementation evaluation willLeonard et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:123 Page 2 of 8
be used to evaluate the implementation strategy and tailor
the intervention to each site, formative midline evaluation
6 months after implementation will measure the initial
intervention outcomes and provide performance feedback
to each site, whereas summative outcome evaluation will
measure the overall success of the program outcomes and
implementation strategy at each site, and will be used to
adapt future waves of implementation.
Context
In the first wave of implementation, the program will be
implemented at five sites (2017), one site from each of
five geographic VA “regions, ”the North Atlantic Region,
the Southeast Region, the Midwest Region, the Continental
Region, and the Pacific Region. These are tertiary hospital
sites that treat more than 1000 rural Veterans annually,
had leadership willing to sign a letter of support, and an
active hospitalist program that cares for the majority of
medical inpatients at the tertiary site. Prior to the second
wave of implementation, we will evaluate implementation
at the first five sites to test the utility of our implementa-
tion strategy. In subsequent waves, the Office of Rural
Health will use a national solicitation of applicants for par-
ticipation in the TNP through a formal application process.
Sites that serve large rural populations will be encouraged
to apply through targeted promotional materials to hos-
pital leadership.
Description of implementation strategy
We will conduct pre-implementation site assessments
before rolling out the program at each expansion site.
Our implementation strategy combines robust pre-implementation work with internal and external facilita-
tion, and audit and feedback.
Pre-implementation
During the pre-implementation phase, we will collect
qualitative contextual data to (1) understand the current
process for transitioning rural Veterans back to their
PCP after an inpatient hospitalization at a VHA tertiary
medical center, (2) identify and highlight the impact of
factors encapsulated in the PRISM framework that may
enhance or discourage the implementation of TNP at
participating sites, and (3) use these data to facilitate im-
plementation, document adaptations to the program,
and enhance sustainability of the intervention and its
implementation. In addition, we will meet with site lead-
ership and identify a hospitalist champion as an internal
facilitator. A hospitalist was chosen for this role to pro-
vide a link between inpatient and outpatient settings and
to help troubleshoot clinical problems with enrolled pa-
tients. Each site will identify a cohort of rural patients to
enroll in the program and modulate the TN workflow to
avoid overlap with other transition of care practices.
Qualitative methods include key informant interviews,
process mapping, as well as site visits with adapted ethno-
graphic observation and a written group brainstorming ac-
tivity (brainwriting). Key info rmant interviews and process
mapping interviews with provi ders and administrators will
begin prior to pre-implementation site visits. Table 1 sum-
marizes how we use these methods to measure PRISM do-
mains in our pre-implementation evaluation.
We will employ process mapping to understand the
current discharge process for rural Veterans and inform

the implementation process [18]. We will validate
process maps using adapted ethnographic observations
on-site visits [19]. During adapted ethnographic observa-
tion, qualitative analysts will join medical teams on
rounds and observe the patient discharge process. Team
members will collect information on the process, inter-
actions among providers and between providers and pa-
tients, and contextual information on the atmosphere.
Process maps will also aid in return on the investment
(ROI) analyses by identifying each role involved in the
discharge process, the steps in the process, and time and
resources required to complete each step in the dis-
charge process.
Key informant interviews with providers at VA tertiary
hospitals and rural PACT clinics will identify attitudes
and beliefs, initial reactions to the TNP, barriers and fa-
cilitators to implementation of the TNP , and participant
perspectives on the potential value of the program. In-
terviews will be summarized for each site and used to in-
form site visit data collection. In particular, interviews
will determine which areas of the discharge process need
clarification or confirmation and identify remaining
questions.
Finally, during pre-implementation site visits, we will
conduct a brainwriting activity [20, 21]. The brainwriting
activity will be used to clarify the rural patient discharge
process at each site, to identify perceived failure points
in the implementation of TNP and to consider strategies
to overcome these barriers. Site visits provide theopportunity to verify what we learn in key informant
and process map interviews.
Pre-implementation data will inform adaptations to
the intervention. We will provide sites with initial feed-
back from our interviews and observations within 1 week
of the site visit using rapid qualitative analysis tech-
niques [22, 23]. This will allow sites to begin planning
for implementation. Additionally, cross-site barriers and
facilitators will be identified and discussed with site
transition nurses and hospital champions during pre-
implementation training.
Transition nurse training
Transition nurses from each site will be trained in their
role prior to implementation. Transition nurses will
complete care coordination and transitions management
(CCTM) online training and a 2-day in-person training
session in Denver. CCTM is conducted through a course
offered by the American Academy of Ambulatory Care
Nursing (AAACN) and was created from a consensus
statement of the AAACN about the core competencies
for care coordination [24]. The in-person training will
take place at the Center for Advancing Professional
E x c e l l e n c e( C A P E )a tt h eU n i v e r s i t yO fC o l o r a d o
School Of Medicine in Denver, CO. This 2-day training
will focus on learning and practicing relationship-
centered communication skills and goal-based effective
feedback techniques, through utilization of standardized
patients. The skills-based training is interactive,Table 1 Assessing PRISM domains to understand context for implementation

experiential, and grounded in feedback. Training will dis-
cuss skills for initiating and maintaining relationships, as
well as sharing information and negotiating a mutual plan
of action. Pre- and post-training surveys will assess nurse
satisfaction and perceived change in confidence and
knowledge after training.
Implementation
Our implementation strategy uses internal and external
facilitation [25] and audit and feedback [25, 26] to en-
courage real-time adaptation of the intervention to each
site. In our intervention, external facilitation will be con-
ducted by a team in Denver. The primary investigator in
Denver (RB) will meet with individual site leadership
and leverage relationships with the Office of Rural
Health and the Office of Nursing Services. Internal fa-
cilitation is conducted by the hospitalist champion, who
will receive data from the team in Denver and have an
on-the-ground role in establishing successful implementa-
tion of the program. Each site must complete the four
core components of the intervention but will individualize
the intervention by determining how the intervention best
fits their needs and local context. For instance, each site
will be responsible for identifying the high-risk rural pa-
tient population they will enroll, as each site has more
rural Veteran hospitalizations (more than 1000 annually
at each site) than the transition nurse can likely enroll
(pilot data suggests enrollment of 250 –350 rural Veterans
annually).
In the first month of implementation, the TN at each
site will participate in a regular teleconference with facil-
itators in Denver to identify barriers to intervention up-
take and formulate solutions. The teleconference will
serve to support the TNs as they begin enrolling patients
in the program, to continually identify barriers to the
program and to promote a community of practice. The
Denver team will conduct a site visit 6 months after the
initial implementation on TNP. The purpose of this site
visit is to understand local context in order to better as-
sist with remaining implementation barriers and to
evaluate implementation fidelity. This is part of our
audit and feedback strategy. By monitoring implementa-
tion at each site and assessing barriers as they arise, we
will collect actionable data to share with the hospitalist
champions that can be used to customize the TNP to
each site. For example, we will share with each site the
number of Veterans admitted, the number of Veterans
who receive all components of the intervention, the time
required to enroll Veterans in the program, and hospital
readmission rates on a monthly to quarterly basis.
In addition, the facilitators in Denver will also provide
contextual interventions to address problems that may
arise during implementation (e.g., problems identified in
teleconferences and site visits). Possible interventions forbarriers include targeted capacity building, team building,
encouraging and facilitating communication, reaching out
to leadership to enlist support for the intervention, and
providing knowledge sharing opportunities (e.g., best
practices).
We will ask the first five sites to facilitate implementa-
tion at the second wave of sites using a “train the
trainer ”approach. We will create a manual that encap-
sulates lessons learned, common barriers to implementa-
tion, and solutions to these barriers and ask the first five
sites to consider using this manual to “train ”the new
sites in their region.
Implementation outcomes
We will assess both intervention outcomes and imple-
mentation outcomes [27, 28]. We will use the RE-AIM
framework [29] to measure implementation outcomes
(see Table 2).
We will complement RE-AIM with the use of an
adapted version of the Stirman adaptation and modifica-
tion framework [30] to systematically document program
modifications during implementation. Our pragmatic ap-
proach emphasizes the need for careful balance between
fidelity to core program elements and modifications of
peripheral program components (i.e., those components
that are not essential to achieving consistent program out-
comes) to local circumstances and preferences. The
adapted Stirman framework includes tracking who makes
modifications, what is modified, at what level of delivery,
context modifications, and the nature of context modifica-
tions. Using this information in combination with inter-
vention outcome measures, we will determine which parts
of the intervention are necessary for success, in order to
inform subsequent waves of implementation and to en-
sure sustainability in present and future contexts.
All qualitative data will be managed and coded using
Atlas.ti [31] according to PRISM domains. A priori
codes were developed through group discussion; addi-
tional codes that emerge will be applied to all previously
coded manuscripts until saturation is reached [32 –34].
Intercoder reliability will be conducted through team-
based consensus building; qualitative analysts will inde-
pendently code the same three transcripts and then
discuss points of divergence and convergence. These dis-
cussions and coding of additional transcripts will con-
tinue until the group reaches consensus on the code
meaning and application. Investigators with expertise in
qualitative methods and implementation science (JJ, BR)
will moderate these discussions.
Intervention outcomes
Intervention outcomes will gauge the effects of the inter-
vention Veteran health outcomes (e.g., reduction in
30-day readmissions and Emergency Department visits).Leonard et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:123 Page 5 of 8
Due to restrictions of the funding agency, we cannot use
a randomized design. Therefore, we are using a rigorous
non-randomized design. We will conduct a difference-
in-differences analysis using similar VA facilities as a
control. Facilities will be matched based on their pro-
pensity for intervention assignment. Propensity scores
will take into account potential confounders including
both summarized patient and facility-level factors such
as percent rurality, size, readmission rates, and patient
risk factors. Our primary outcome will be 30-day re-
admission and Emergency Department visit rate. We will
compare 30-day readmission and Emergency Depart-
ment visit rates during a defined pre-intervention period
at both intervention and control sites, and again begin-
ning 6 months after implementation. We will also con-
duct an ROI analysis of the TNP, comparing the costs of
implementing the program and the costs of the TN with
reductions in post-discharge utilization costs. Finally, we
will measure client outcomes like Veteran satisfaction.
Discussion
The TNP is an innovative intervention with the dual
goals of (1) improving the transition of care for rural
Veterans hospitalized at tertiary VA hospitals and (2)
testing a novel application of PRISM to assess contextual
elements and tailor the intervention to individual sites.
This study represents a robust application of the PRISMframework to a novel intervention. As a type II hybrid
intervention-implementation study, we are also assessing
novel implementation strategies combining internal and
external facilitation and aud it and feedback. Our implemen-
tation strategy is unique in its use of PRISM to integrate
data from a variety of sources in a pre-implementation
evaluation with the goal of providing real-time feedback to
sites to enhance the impact adop tion, implementation, and
impact of the TNP.
The TNP builds on components of existing successful
Transition Nurse Programs, such as the Department of
Veterans Affairs Coordinated Transitional Care (C-Trac)
program [35, 36]. C-Trac utilizes nurse case managers to
work with patients on care coordination after discharge
to community settings from a VA hospital. Like the TNP ,
C-Trac involves direct communication between the nurse
case manager and patients via a post-discharge follow-up
call. TNP builds on this program by promoting relation-
ship building between the TN at VA tertiary hospitals and
nursing staff at rural PACT sites. The creators of C-Trac
used a modified version of the Replicating Effective Pro-
grams (REP) implementation theory model to adapt C-
Trac to different contexts. REP is most commonly used at
the population level rather than the hospital level and be-
gins with the identification of a local site champion and
documentation of existing process, followed by a pre-
implementation phase that focuses on stakeholderTable 2 RE-AIM measures in the rural transition nurse program

engagement and coaching, identification of barriers, staff
training, and also guiding stakeholders in formally adapt-
ing programs and documenting modifications [37]. We
feel that PRISM is more appropriate for our intervention
because it has a greater focus on understanding local con-
textual factors and organization, allowing for adaptations
to diverse and unique environments. PRISM also includes
the RE-AIM framework for evaluation. In our ap-
proach, external facilitators monitor the intervention
using RE-AIM measures and feed the data to internal
facilitators, allowing them to make targeted modifica-
tions to the intervention when necessary.
PRISM has proven a useful framework for several
interventions. Liles et al. [13] used PRISM to explore
internal and external barriers to colorectal cancer
screening. They were able to identify barriers to colo-
rectal screening at the staff, provider, and patient
levels through stakeholder interviews, and were able
to implement a program that addressed these specific
barriers. Similarly, Beck et al. [12] used PRISM to as-
sess barriers and facilitators in focus groups. As far as
we know, our study is the first application of PRISM
to assess context, barriers, and facilitators using data
from such a wide variety of sources. Our use of PRISM
to integrate data from multiple sources is also unique.
We are unaware of another intervention using PRISM
as a data reduction tool.
This study represents a robust application of the
PRISM framework to a novel intervention. Results of
our analysis will inform the utility of the PRISM frame-
work for developing better implementation and evalu-
ation strategies. Our multi-source data will allow us to
assess the utility of our pre-implementation strategies
and determine which are most successful, and to assess
the utility of our intervention training and implementa-
tion strategies. Our use of the Stirman framework [34]
for tracking modifications to the intervention as well as
RE-AIM [33] for measuring program outcomes will
allow us to assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, im-
plementation, and maintenance of the program in real
time. In each subsequent wave of implementation, we
will be able to use this information to enhance external
facilitation and may be able to utilize novel study designs
or new strategies when appropriate. Our use of stan-
dardized frameworks will make our findings applicable
to the development, adaptation, and dissemination of
new health interventions.
The primary focus of the TNP is to improve the transi-
tion of care for rural Veterans. Successful implementa-
tion will lead to reduced hospital readmissions through
improved follow-up care and communication between
hospitals and rural PACT sites. Our findings will have
implications for the development of programs address-
ing transitions of care for vulnerable patient populations.Abbreviations
