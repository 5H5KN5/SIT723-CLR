 Abstract  1 
Objective:  Childhood sun exposure increases risk of skin cancer in later life. Parents of young 2 
children play an important role in minimizing childhood sun exposure. The aim of the current study 3 
was to identify the motivational, volitional, and implicit a ntecedents of parents’ sun -protective 4 
behavior s based on an Integrated Behavior  Change model. Methods: Parents ( N = 373) of 2 to 5 5 
year-old children self -reported their intentions, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavior al 6 
control, autonomous and co ntrolled motivation,  action plans, habit, and past behavior s with respect 7 
to sun -protective behavior s for their children. Two weeks later  (n = 273) , the parents self -reported 8 
their participation in sun -protective behavior s for their child. Results: Data w ere analyzed using  9 
variance -based structural equation modelling. Results showed significant direct effects of attitudes, 10 
subjective norm, perceived behavior al control , and past behavior  on intentions , and significant 11 
direct effects of autonomous motivation,  perceived behavioral control, intention s, action planning, 12 
habit, and past behavior  on parents’ participation in sun -protective behavior s for their child. There 13 
were also significant total indirect effects of autonomous motivation on intentions mediated b y 14 
attitudes  and subjective norm . Conclusions:  Current results  indicate that parents’ sun -protective 15 
behavior s toward their children are a function of motivational (autonomous motivation, intentions ), 16 
volitional (action planning), and implicit (habit) facto rs. The findings from the current study 17 
provide formative data to inform the development of behavior  change interventions to increase 18 
parents’ participation in sun -protective behavior s for their children.  19

 One in every three cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer (WHO, 2015), with Australia reported 1 
as having the world’s highest age-standardiz ed incidence rate of skin melanoma (AIHW , 2012). 2 
Skin cancers predominately develop as a result of a lifetime of excessive exposure to ultraviolet 3 
(UV) radiation in sunlight (WHO, 2015) . An estimated 50% of total UV exposure to age 60 occurs 4 
before  the age of 2 0 years , and silicone casts of the skin of teenagers aged 13–15 years in four cities 5 
in eastern Australia showed 40% to 70% already ha d signs of UV-induced skin damage  (Green, 6 
Wallingford, & McBride, 2011) . Childhood sun exposure  and multiple sunburns  are associated with 7 
increased  lifetime risk of skin cancer  (Cancer Council Australia, 2016 ; Green et al., 2011).  This is a 8 
concern given that most children (69%) report having been  sunburnt one or more  times  (Green et 9 
al., 2011). Sun-protective behavior s such as the consistent use of sunscreen  during childhood has 10 
been estimated to reduce lifetime skin cancer risk by up to 80% (Stern, Weinstein, & Baker, 1986 ). 11 
Reducing exposure to harmful  levels of UV radiation in childhood is therefore vital in decreasing 12 
skin cancer risk in later life  (Hornung, 2000) . As young children  have limited capacities for self - 13 
regulating their sun-protective  behavior s, parental guidance is needed  (Hamilton, Cleary, White, & 14 
Hawkes, 2016 ; Hamilton, Kirkpatrick, Rebar, Whit e, & Hagger, 2017 ). However, even if parents 15 
are motivated to ensure their child engages in appropriate sun protection, corresponding behavior s 16 
may not ensue  (Hamilton et al., 2016) .  17 
It is well known that people who are motivated to act often do not behav e according to their 18 
intentions (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) and instead act ‘mindlessly’ or impulsively, paying little 19 
attention to the reasoning behind their behavior  or its consequences (Strack & Deutsch, 2004). The 20 
reasons for these failures to act may be because individuals are faced with multiple impediments 21 
(such as distractions  and competing parenting demands , Hamilton, Spinks, White, Kavanagh, & 22 
Walsh, 2016; Hamilton & White, 2010 ; Spinks & Hamilton, 201 6) that tend to derail attempt s to 23 
engage in intended behavior s. If individuals are not equipped with means to meet these obstacles or 24 
their cognitive capacity is low , then motivation alone will be insufficient to ensure they act on their 25 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   5 
 intentions . To overcome this limitation, volitional and implic it processes are thought to operate in 1 
concert with and independent of motivational processes.   2 
Theoretical Bases of Behavior  Change  3 
For decades, social psychologists and behavior al scientists have attempted to develop 4 
comprehensive, parsimonious theoretic al models that are effective in predicting people’s intentions 5 
and behavior . Human behavior , however, is complex with multiple processes guiding decision 6 
making. Motivational models and theories  such as theory of planned behavior  (Ajzen, 1991)  and 7 
self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) ; volitional, dual -process models such as health 8 
action process approach  (Schwarzer, 2008) ; and implicit, automatic  theories such as reflective 9 
impulsive model  (Strack & Deutsch, 2004)  have been attempts aimed at better  understanding 10 
human behavior . Researchers have also attempted to integrate and extend these models to further 11 
understanding  of the processes that impact health behavior  engagement and maintenance (e.g., 12 
Allom, Mullan, Cowie, Hamilton, 2016; Arnautovska, F leig, O’Callaghan, &  Hamilton, 2017; 13 
Hagger , Chan, Protogerou, & Chatzisarantis , 2016 a; Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2014; Hagger, Trost, 14 
Keech, Chan, & Hamilton, 2017; Hamilton, Cox, & White, 2012 ; Reyes Fernández , Knoll, 15 
Hamilton, & Schwarzer, 2016 ).  16 
For ex ample, Hagger and Chatzisarantis (2014) recently proposed an integrated behavior  17 
change (IBC) model. The model integrates processes from  key motivational theories that have been 18 
previously employed to predict participation in health -related behaviors. The model outlines  the 19 
factors that relate to  intention formation ( Ajzen, 1991; Deci & Ryan, 1985) , the self -regulatory and 20 
volitional processes that lead to the enactment of intention s (Gollwitzer  & Sheeran , 2006 ; 21 
Schwarzer, 2008) , and  the non -conscious, impl icit processes that lead to behavior al engagement 22 
beyond an individual’s awareness ( Hagger, 2016; Strack & Deutsch, 2004) . The integrated model 23 
addresses the limitations of traditional social cognitive and motivational models that do not account 24 
for voliti onal and implicit processes (for a complete  overview of the model see Hagger & 25 
Chatzisarantis, 2014). Three processes  in the integrated model  - motivational, volitional, and 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   6 
 implicit  – are proposed to guide  behavior  change . The relative contribution of eac h process is 1 
important when identifying the pathways to action and should be considered when designing  2 
interventions to change behavior . To date, little research has examined how these three processes 3 
operate together to explain behavior , and no attempt ha s been made to formally test these three 4 
processes  in the area of sun safety . Further, given that parents are likely to express positive attitudes 5 
and intentions regarding their child ren’s health behavior s but fail to act consistent with their beliefs, 6 
the model may shed light on the processes for these failures and point to possible strategies to 7 
intervene.  8 
The Current Study and Hypotheses  9 
The aim of the current study  was to test the predictions of an IBC model in the context of 10 
parents’ behavior  to sun protect their young children. The approach is unique as it is the first to 11 
simultaneously account  for three sets of process es likely to impact on  behavior  derived from 12 
theories of motivation, social cognition, and volition : motivation, volitional, and  implic it. The 13 
motivational pathways are represented by the effects of motivational and social cognitive constructs 14 
from the integration of self -determination theory and theory of planned behavior , respectively. The 15 
volitional pathway s are represented by the effe cts of action planning on the intention -behavior  16 
relationship. The implicit  pathways are represented by participants’ self -reported habit.  All of these 17 
processes are stated  formally in a series of a priori hypotheses  listed in Appendix A (supplemental 18 
mate rials). We outline the hypotheses in the next section. The hypotheses are illustrated in Figure 1, 19 
which can be used as a reference guide alongside  the hypotheses listed in  Appendix A to clarify 20 
model predictions . 21 
Turning first to the motivational effects in the proposed model, autonomous forms of 22 
motivation from self -determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) are hypothesized  to serve as distal 23 
predictors of the social co gnitive antecedents of behavior  from the theory of planned behavior , 24 
attitudes (H 1), sub jective norm (H 2), and perceived behavior al control (H 3). These effects ar e based 25 
on previous integration  of these theories consistent with  the premise that autonomous forms of 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   7 
 motivation lead to adaptive outcomes because they are self -endorsed and satisfy  psychological 1 
needs. Attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavior al control  are proposed to  mediate 2 
autonomous motivation effects on intentions and behavior because individuals are proposed to align 3 
their beliefs with their motives. These effects ha ve been supported empirically in multiple studies 4 
(e.g., Hagger & Chatzisarantis , 2016 ; Hagger et al., 2017, 2016a,b ). In contrast, controlled forms of 5 
motivation are hypothesized to predict subjective norm only (H 5) and have null effects on attitudes 6 
(H4) and perceived behavior al control (H 6). Non-self determined beliefs reflect externally - 7 
referenced motives , are not need satisfying  and, therefore , tend not be congruent with attitudes and 8 
perceived behavior al control. Conversely,  as subjective norm  reflect s social pressure for engaging 9 
in the future action, these beliefs tend to be aligned with subjective norm.  Consistent with the theory 10 
of planned behavior  (Ajzen, 1991)  and meta -analytic studies in health behavior (McEachan, 11 
Conner, Taylor, & Lawton, 2012;  Rich, Brandes, Mullan, & Hagger, 2016) , attitudes (H 7), 12 
subjective norm (H 8), and perceived behavior al control (H 9) are proposed to predict intentions ; and 13 
intentions (H 10) and perceived behavior al control (H 11) are proposed as predictors of behavior . The 14 
model also account s for the predictions of self -determination theory which propose s direct relations 15 
of autonomous (H 15) and controlled (H 16) motivation on behavior,  with support  found for these 16 
effects  in studies in health contexts ( Hagger & Chatzisarant is, 2015) . 17 
Consistent with theories and models that propose a volitional process that operates in a post - 18 
decisional manner to facilitate the enactment of goal intentions, it is proposed that intentions would 19 
predict action planning (H 12) and action plannin g would predict behavior  (H13). These predictions 20 
are consistent with the health action process approach  (Schwarzer, 2008)  and previous studies 21 
adopting the model across various  health behaviors (e.g., Reyes Fernández  et al., 2016; Zhou, Miao, 22 
Hamilton, Kn oll, Schwarzer, 2015) . It is further proposed that action planning would moderate the 23 
intention -behavior  relationship  consistent with the model of action phases (Gollwitzer  & Sheeran , 24 
2006 ) (H17). This is based on the premise  that individuals adopting plan ning strategies are more 25 
likely to convert their good intentions into action behavior , and has been empirically supported in a 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   8 
 number of studies (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) . The IBC model also predicts that individuals with 1 
considerable experience with th e behavior  and likely to have developed  a routine to engage in the 2 
behavior , will have a more automatic, non -intentional pathway to behavior . These effects have been 3 
predicted in studies using dual process approaches to health behavior (Hagger, 2016; Rebar  et al., 4 
2016 ; Strack & Deut sch, 2004 ) and is represented by the direct effect of habit on behavior  (H14). 5 
Finally, the effects in the model are expected to be independent of past behavior  in that proposed 6 
effects will hold even while controlling for past behavior . This is an important consideration given 7 
the pervasive effects of past behavior on behavior in tests of psychological theories in health 8 
contexts (Hagger et al., 2016 a). According ly, past behavior is  essential t o evaluate whether a model 9 
has effi cacy in accounting for unique variance in the behavioral outcome. If past behavior 10 
attenuates all model effects to trivial values, then the model would be considered redundant.  In the 11 
current study, it is proposed  that significant effects of past behavior  on all constructs in the model 12 
will emerge (H18). 13 
A set of indirect effects consistent with the premises of the IBC model  are also specified . 14 
Consistent with Ajzen’s (1991) exposition of the theory of planned behavior  and previous research 15 
(Hagger et al., 2016 a), it is proposed that  indirect effects of attitudes  (H19), subjective norm  (H20), 16 
and perceived behavior al control  (H21) on behavior  through  intentions  will emerge . Consistent  with 17 
the integration of the theory of planned behavior and self -determinat ion theory, it is proposed that 18 
autonomous motivation will predict intentions (H 22) through attitudes, subjective norm, and 19 
perceived behavior al control, and  predict  behavior  through these variables and intention s (H24). 20 
Empirical research has suppor ted these indirect effects in health contexts (Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 21 
2016).  Similarly, the same pattern of effects for controlled motivation on intentions (H 23) and 22 
behavior  (H25) is expected , but mediated by subjective norm and subjective norm and intentions , 23 
respectively.  This is, again, congruent with t he premise that subjective norm  reflect s perceived 24 
pressures from significant others and controlled motives reflect externally -referenced reasons for 25 
action.  Finally, consistent with hypotheses from the healt h action process approach  (Schwarzer, 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   9 
 2008) , action planning is proposed to mediate the effect of intention s on behavior  (H26). These 1 
effects are, however , conditional on the multiple direct effects that make  up the mediation effects.  2 
Method  3 
Participants  4 
Participants  (N = 373) were residents of  Queensland, Australia and comprised parents  who 5 
had at least one child aged between 2 and 5 years who usually resided in the same household as the 6 
parent. Parents were independent, with only one partner from each cou ple completing the 7 
questionnaire . Two weeks later, 273 (73% of the baseline sample ) of the parents completed the 8 
follow -up survey . Lack of time and  going on school holidays  were the main reasons for attrition . 9 
Participants were recruited via online adverti sing (e.g., online parenting forums such as “BubHub” 10 
and “Raising Children Network”, social media such as “Facebook”),  face-to-face (e.g., dance 11 
schools, shopping centres), and th rough schools and childcare facilities. As an incentive to 12 
participat e in the  study, p articipants were offered the opportunity to enter a prize draw to win one of 13 
three double movie passes. Sample demographic characteristics are presented in  Table 1.  14 
Design and Procedure  15 
The study was conducted at two major universities in Queensla nd, Australia  – Griffith 16 
University and Central Queensland University . The University Human Research Ethics Committee  17 
of both universities approved the study . Data were collected between October 2014 and August 18 
2015, with recorded UV index values during th e data collection months ranging between 4-13, 19 
indicat ive of  a UV exposure category of “moderate ” to “extreme ” (ARPNSA , 2017 ). Sun protection 20 
is highly recommended for UV index values of 3 or higher  (Cancer Council Australia , 2016). The 21 
study used a correl ational design with a two week behavioral follow -up. At Time 1 (T1), 22 
participants completed a questionnaire either face-to-face or on -line assessing motivational 23 
processes (autonomous and control motivation, attitude s, subjective norm, perceived behavior al 24 
control , intention s, and past behavior ), volitional processes (action planning), and automatic 25 
processes ( habit ). Demographic variables were also collected. At Time 2 (T2), a follow -up 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   10 
 telephone call was conducted to measure the decisions parents had made  regarding their child ren’s 1 
sun-protective behavior s during the previous two weeks. Consent was gained through the 2 
completion of the T1 questionnaire, and consent to contact participants for the T2 follow -up was 3 
given through the provision of contact detai ls. Data across each of the time point s were able to be 4 
de-identified and matched using a unique code identifier created by the participant.  5 
Measures  6 
Psychological constructs were measured on multi -item psychometric instruments developed 7 
using standardized  guidelines and validated in previous studies and adapted for use with the target 8 
behavior in the current  study  (Hamilton et al., 2016; Thomson , White,  & Hamilton, 2012; White 9 
Starfelt, Young, Hawkes, Leske, & Hamilton, 2015) . Brief details of the measures  are provided 10 
below  and a full set of items are available in Appendix B (supplemental materials ). Items from each 11 
instrument were used as indicator s of latent variables representing each model construct in a 12 
structural equation model.  13 
Sun-protective behavi or. The target behavior  was sun-protective behavior s based on the 14 
guidelines of sun protection outlined by Cancer Council Australia (201 6): (a) applying SPF 30+ 15 
sunscreen ; (b) wearing sun -protective clothing such as a hat, long -sleeved shirt, and sunglasse s; and 16 
(c) seeking shade between 10am and 3pm. The target behavior  was to be adopted every time their 17 
child was outdoors in direct sunlight for more than 10 minutes. Parents were asked to think of the 18 
sun-protective behavior s they engaged in for their youn gest child aged 2 to 5 years. Given that 19 
adequate sun protection does not require performing of all sun -safety  behavior s simultaneously 20 
(e.g., if a person wear s a hat, seeks shade, and applies sunscreen, long -sleeved clothing may not be 21 
necessary), separat e measures of individual sun -protective behavior s are not essential to reflect 22 
adequate protection (Hamilton et al., 2016 ; White  et al., 2015 ). Examples of sun -protective 23 
measures were provided to parents and  they then decided whether the measures they had  undertaken 24 
for their child provided sufficient sun protection . 25 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   11 
 At T1 and T 2, sun-protective behavior s performed by the parent for their child in the 1 
previous two weeks  was measured using four items (e.g., “Think about the past 2 week s. In general, 2 
how often did you perform sun -protective behavior s for your child ”) with responses given on 7 - 3 
point Likert scales ranging from  never (1) to always  (7). Similar measures have been used in studies 4 
on sun safety ( White et al., 2015 ). 5 
Intention.  Parent i ntention to perform sun -protective behavior s for their child was measured 6 
using four items (e.g., “ I intend to perform sun -protective behavior s for my child  every time they go 7 
in the sun for more than 10 minutes in the next 2 weeks ”, scored (1) strongly disagree to (7) 8 
strongly agree ). 9 
Attitude.  Parent a ttitude to perform sun -protective behavior s for their child was assessed 10 
using five semantic differential items (e.g., “ Performing sun -protective behavior s for my child 11 
every time they go in the sun for more than 10 minu tes during the next 2 weeks would be...  bad – 12 
good ”, scored (1) to (7). 13 
Subjective n orm.  Subjective norm was measured using five items assessing how likely 14 
parents ’ believe important others in their life would want them to perform sun -protective behavior s 15 
for their child  (e.g., “ Those people who are important to me  would want me to perform sun - 16 
protective behavior s for my child  every time they go in the sun for more than 10 minutes in the next 17 
2 weeks ”, scored (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree ). 18 
Perceived behavior al control.  Perceived behavioral control was assessed using four items 19 
measuring parents ’ level of self -efficacy and control over performing sun -protective behavior s for 20 
their child  (e.g., “I have complete control over whether my child’s su n-protective behavior s are 21 
performed  every time they go in the sun for more than 10 minutes in the next 2 weeks ”, scored (1) 22 
strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree ). 23 
Autonomous and controlled motivation.  An adapted version of Ryan and Connell’s  (1989) 24 
measure of perceived locus of causality was used to measure parents’ autonomous and controlled 25 
motivation to perform sun -protective behavior s for their child. Participants were presented with 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   12 
 initial instructions: “The following questions relate to the reason s why you would perform sun - 1 
protective behavior s for your child every time they go in the sun for more than 10 minutes. 2 
Different people have different reasons for doing that, and we want to know how true each of the 3 
following reasons is for you”. They wer e next presented with a common stem: “ The reason I would 4 
perform sun -protective behavior s for my child every time they go in the sun for more than 10 5 
minutes is: …” followed by four reasons  for autonomous motivation (e.g., “… because it is very 6 
important for  my child being as healthy as possible ”) and four reasons for controlled  motivation 7 
(e.g., “…b ecause others would be upset with me if I did not”).  Responses were measured on seven - 8 
point scales ranging from (1) not at all true to (7) very true .  9 
Action plan ning. Action planning was measured by four items developed by Sniehotta, 10 
Schwarzer, Scholz, and Schuz  (2005) and assessed the extent to which parents had made a plan in 11 
relation to performing sun -protective behavior s for their child every time they go in t he sun for 12 
more than 10 minutes during the next 2 weeks. Participants were required to respond to the stem: “I 13 
have made a plan regarding...” followed by the four items of the scale (e.g., “…when to perform 14 
sun-protective behavior s for my child”) on Likert  scales ranging from not at all true (1) to exactly 15 
true (7). 16 
Habit . The 12 -item Self -Report Habit Index (Verplanken & Orbell, 2003) was used to 17 
measure the extent to which child sun -protective behavior s were  performed habitually by parents . 18 
Participants w ere required to respond to the stem: “ Performing sun -protective behavior s on my 19 
child  is something…” followed by the 12 items of the scale (e.g., “… I do frequently ”) on Likert 20 
scales ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (7). 21 
Demographic var iables.  Participants self -reported their gender, age in years, number of 22 
children, highest education level ( junior  school, senior  school, TAFE/high school diploma, 23 
university undergraduate degree, university postgraduate degree), ethnicity (Caucasian, 24 
Indigenous/Torres Strait Islander, Asian, Pacific Islander, African, other), employment status 25 
(currently unemployed/full -time caregiver, currently employed full -time, part -time/casual 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   13 
 employed, full -time/part -time student), and family income (zero -$18,000, $18201 -$37,000, $37001 - 1 
$80,000, $80,001 -$180,000, $180,000+). For subsequent analyses , these variables were represented 2 
as dichotomous dummy -coded  variables for highest education level (1 = university undergraduate 3 
degree, university postgraduate degree; 0 =  primary school or secondary school or TAFE/high 4 
school diploma),  ethnicity (1 = Caucasian; 0 = non -Caucasian),  employment status (1 = currently 5 
employed full -time; 0 = currently unemployed/full -time caregiver or employed part -time/casual 6 
employed or full -time/part -time student) , and family income (1 = zero -$18,000; 0 = $18201 - 7 
$37,000 or $37001 -$80,000 or $80,001 -$180,000 or $180,000+).  8 
Data Analysis  9 
We used variance -based structural equation modeling (VB -SEM) to test our hypothesized 10 
model. VB-SEM is simil ar to covariance -based SEM in that it explicitly models measurement error 11 
using latent factors. However, VB -SEM is based on ranked data and is, therefore, distribution -free 12 
and less affected by model complexity, sample size, or non -normality. This makes it  optimal for use 13 
in the current analysis given the complexity of the model and the greater statistical power offered by 14 
the VB -SEM method. Models were estimated using the Warp PLS v5.0 software (Kock, 2015). 15 
Missing data were treated using stochastic hiera rchical regression imputation which has been shown 16 
to minimize standard errors in simulations  with the amount of data replaced ranging from 0.37% to 17 
1.10% across all variables  (Kock, 201 5). Items from the measures of the psychological and 18 
behavioral constr ucts were set as indicators of latent variables. All paths  among constructs  of the 19 
proposed model detailed in Figure 1 and Appendix A ( supplemental  material) were specified as free 20 
parameters in the model. In addition, paths were included from the demograp hic variables to each 21 
of the psychological and behavioral variables in the model to statistically control for these variables.  22 
Validity of the proposed measures was assessed by observing  the parameters of the 23 
measurement aspects of the SEM. T he loading of each indicator on its respective latent factor  was 24

were expected to exceed .700 and .500, respectively . Discriminant validity of latent variables was 2 
confirmed if the square -root of the AVE of the variable was larger than its correlation with the other 3 
variables in the model.  4 
Overall g oodne ss of fit of the proposed model was evaluated using multiple criteria: the 5 
goodness -of-fit (GoF) index  with values of .100, .250, and .360 correspond ing to small, medium, 6 
and large effect sizes , respectively  (Tenenhaus, Vinzi, Chatelin, & Lauro, 2005),  the average path 7 
coefficient (APC ) and the average R2 (ARS) , both of which should be significantly different from 8 
zero for an adequate model , and the average variance inflation factor for model parameters (AVIF) 9 
statistic , with values less than 5.000 indicati ng a well -fitting model  (Kock, 2015). Hypothesized 10 
mediation effects were tested by calculating indirect effects using a bootstrap resampling method 11 
with 100 replications.  12 
Results  13 
Participants  14 
Demographic characteristics of the sample at the two time point s are presented in Table 1. 15 
Data were missing from 100 participants due to absences at either time point, resulting in a final 16 
sample of 273 participants (females = 238; males = 35, M age = 34.80, SD = 5.21). Attrition 17 
analyses indicated that there were no  significant differences in number of children ( t(371) = 0.495, 18 
p = .062 , d = 0.051 ), age ( t(371) = 1.73, p = .084, d = 0.179) , highest education level (χ2(1) = 0.567, 19 
p = .452, d = 0.077), or psychological and behavior al variables (attitude s, subjective norm, 20 
perceived behavior al control, intention s, autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, action 21 
planning, habit , and past behavior ) measured at the first time point (Wilks’ Lambda = .966, 22 
F(9,352) = 1.379, p = .196, d = 0.122) between participants that dropped out of the study and those 23 
who completed the T2 assessment. There were, however, differences in gender distribution (χ2(1) = 24 
6.87, p = .009, d = 0.274), ethnic distribution (χ2(1) = 9.11, p = .003, d = 0.315), employment status 25 
(χ2(1) = 19.25, p < .001, d = 0.465), and family income (χ2(1) = 4.34, p = .009, d = 0.217). There 26

 was a greater proportion of females, non-Caucasians, full -time employees , and high income earners 1 
among participants that dropped out relative to those that remained in the study.  2 
Preliminary A nalyses  3 
Measurement  model  statistics  from the VB-SEM conf irmed that the latent variables met 4 
criteria for construct and discriminant va lidity.  Factor loadings for each latent factor are presented 5 
in Appendix C (supplemental materials). All loadings exceeded the .700 criterion  supporting the 6 
validity of the factors. T he only exception was one item for the SR HI, but given this factor was 7 
indicated by 12 items, the errant loading was not considered a threat to validity. Composite 8 
reliability coefficients, AVE , and intercorrelations for model variables are presented in Table 2. 9 
Reliability coefficients exceeded the .700 criterion and AVE value s exceeded  the recommended  10 
.500 criterion  for all factors . Factor correlations am ong the latent variables also indicated no 11 
problems with discriminant validity. Goodness of fit statistics revealed  acceptable overall fit of the 12 
model with the data according to the multiple indices  adopted  (GoF Index  = .527 ; APC = . 111, p = 13 
.016, ARS = .337, p < .001; AVIF = 1.195 ). 14 
Model  Effects  15 
Standardized parameter estimates for t ests of hypothesized  structural relations among the IBC 16 
model factors  identified in Figure 1  and Appendix A (supplemental materials) are presented in 17 
Figure 2. A full breakdo wn of  estimates including direct, indirect, and total effects are presented in 18 
the table in Appendix D (supplemental materials) . In addition, effects  of control variables in the 19 
model are  available in a separate table in Appendix E (supplemental materials) . Autonomous 20 
motivation had statistically significant direct effects on attitudes (H 1), subjective norm (H 2), and 21 
perceived behavior al control (H 3), as predicted. Controlled motivation had a statistically signif icant 22 
effect on subjective norm (H5), and no effect on attitudes (H 4) and perceived behavior al control (H 6) 23 
consistent with hypotheses.  This suggests that parents who endorsed more self -determined reasons 24 
for acting were more likely to hold positive attitudes, perceived control, and normative beliefs  for 25 
engaging in sun -protective behaviors for thei r children.  As predicted, attitudes (H 7), subjective 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   16 
 norm (H 8), and perceived behavior al control (H 9) were all statistically significant  positive predictors 1 
of intentions.  These results suggest that parents ’ attitudes, perceptions of control, and beliefs about 2 
norms with respect to sun -protective behaviors for their children directly impacted their self - 3 
reported intentions to engage in such behaviors.  There were also statistically significant positive 4 
effect s of intention s on behavior (H 10) and action planning (H 12), and of action planning on behavior  5 
(H13), as hypothesized.  It seems that parents who form intentions and action plans for sun -protective 6 
behaviors for their children are more likely to report hav ing engaged in those behaviors.  In addition, 7 
perceived behavior al control (H 11) and habit (H 14) were significant predictors on behavior , as 8 
hypothesized . Autonomous motivation was also a significan t direct predictor of behavior (H 15), 9 
consistent with our h ypothesis.  There was no statistically significant direct effect of controlled (H 16) 10 
motivation on behavior , so this hypothesi s was rejected. Also, contrary to hypothes es (H 17), action 11 
planning did not moderate the intention -behavior  relationship. Past beha vior statistically 12 
significantly predicted all variables in the model as hypothesized (H 18). 13 
Turning to the hypothesized indirect effects, there were no statistically significant indirect 14 
effects of attitudes (H 19), subjective norm (H 20), and perceived behavior al control (H 21) on behavior , 15 
leading to a rejection of these hypotheses. There was, however, a significant total indirect effect of 16 
autonomous motivation on intention s mediated by attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived 17 
behavior al control consisten t with our hypothesis (H 22, β = . 180, p = .001).  Parents who hold 18 
autonomous motives to engage in sun -safety behaviors are more likely to form intentions to engage 19 
in those behaviors because their beliefs are aligned with their motives and intentions accordingly.  20 
There was, however , no total indirect effect of controlled motivation on in tention s through 21 
subjective norm , so this hypothesis was rejected (H 23, β = . 039, p = .260 ). There was no significant 22 
total indirect effect of autonomous motivation on behavior  through attitudes, sub jective norm, 23 
perceived behavior al control, and intentions , leading to a rejection of our hypothesis  (H24, β = . 044, 24 
p = .23 1). Similarly, controlled motivation did not significantly predict behavior  through subjective 25 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   17 
 norm  and intention s (H25, β = . 007, p = .426 ). Finally, there was no indirect effect of intentions on 1 
behavior  through action planning, so this hypothesis was also rejected (H 26, β = . 023, p = .296 ).  2 
Discussion  3 
The aim of the current study was to test the predictions of an IBC model (Hagger & 4 
Chatzisarantis, 2014) with respect to parents’ sun -protective behavior s for their children. The model 5 
identified key processes derived from multiple theoretical models of motivation, social cognition, 6 
and volition and adopted hypotheses from self -determi nation theory, theory of planned behavior , 7 
the health action process approach and action -control theory, and dual process models of action. 8 
Results indicated significant effects of motivational, volitional, and implicit factors on parents’ 9 
intentions and behavior  to engage in sun -protective behavior s for their children. Intentions , 10 
perceived behavioral control,  and autonomous motivation had small but significant direct effects on 11 
behavior . Action planning and habit were also direct predictors of behavior , also with small effect 12 
sizes, supporting the effects of volitional strategies and implicit processes. The relative contribution 13 
of intention s, action planning, and habit on behavior  were similar, indicating that each process 14 
appears to have independent effe cts on behavior . Importantly, the effects were independent of past 15 
behavior , so these psychological factors account for unique varia nce in behavior , regardless of 16 
previous experience.  17 
A key contribution of the current research is the confirmation of multip le pathways by which 18 
parents’ psychological constructs affect sun -protective behavior s toward their children. Consistent 19 
with the social cognitive and motivational theoretical components  that comprise the 20 
deliberative/reasoned component of the IBC model , belief-based ( e.g., attitudes) and motivational 21 
(autonomous motivation) factors predicted the sun safety behavior of parents for their children . 22 
However, we also found that volitional and implicit processes account ed for significant variance in 23 
behavior , independent of the deliberative component. Specifically, it seems that both action 24 
planning and habit are important unique predictors of behavior . It is interesting, however, that 25 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   18 
 planning did not account for the intention -behavior  effect, as predicted by th e health action process 1 
approach (Schwarzer, 2008) , but predicted behaviour directly .  2 
A number of potential interpretations of this pattern of effects exist. It is possible, for 3 
example, that all of these effects are present simultaneously for all partici pants, such that the 4 
behavior  is controlled, in part, by all three processes at once. A more likely interpretation, however, 5 
is that the different processes impact behavior  for specific groups of people with certain 6 
characteristics with sufficient strength  to present as non -trivial effects at the group level. In other 7 
words, some participants’ behavior  may be more controlled by deliberative effects while others may 8 
be more influenced by volitional or implicit factors. This trade -off between deliberative and  9 
volitional or implicit factors likely occurs between people as well as within people, shifting across 10 
time as behavior s become more habitual. The critical question arising from this interpretation is 11 
what conditions determine the processes  that control th e behavior . In other words, what moderator 12 
or set of moderators will determine whether the deliberative and intentional, volitional, or implicit 13 
processes predominate in determining parents’ sun -protective behavior  toward young children ?  14 
In the current re search, such moderators were unmeasured. Future studies, therefore, would 15 
need to systematically identify candidate moderators of these processes and test their impact within 16 
an analysis of the validity of the nomological network (Hagger et al., 2016). For  example, 17 
individual difference factors such as capacity of self -regulation or conscientiousness may moderate 18 
the impact of the intentional pathways on behavior . Self -control or affective states may moderate 19 
the within -person links between intention s and behavior . The inclusion of such moderators, which 20 
have yet to be specified in the IBC model but have been explored in other tests of the component 21 
theories (Rhodes, Courneya, & Jones, 2002), may further elucidate the factors that magnify or 22 
diminish the pro posed processes on behavior  according to the model.  23 
The current research also has ramifications for improving  sun protection behavior . Based on 24 
the findings that motivational, volitional, and implicit  factors are all key processes in sun -protection 25 
behavio r of parents toward their children , future interventions and campaigns should target all three 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   19 
 processes to increase sun -protective intentions and behavior  of parents for their young children, 1 
ideally using a multifaceted approach.  Ongoing Australian commu nity-based campaigns (e.g., 2 
“SunSmart”) are aimed at improving the awareness and knowledge about UV exposure and 3 
messages have, to a large extent, taken the form of education and risk awareness  (e.g., “UV. It all 4 
adds up” - a recent campaign  aimed at incre asing people’s  awareness of the risk of developing skin 5 
cancer through incidental exposure to UV radiation ) and reminders to be sun safe (e.g., “Slip [on 6 
sun-protective clothing]! Slop [on SPF 30+ sunscreen]! Slap [on a broad brimmed hat]! Seek 7 
[shade]! Sl ide [on sunglasses]!”).  Community  and nation -wide programs have established an 8 
improvement in attitudes  and behavior  over time which corresponds with the public campaigning of 9 
these sun -safe messages ( e.g., Volkov et al., 2013) , and some program s for paren ts have been 10 
shown to increase sun protection for their children (Dadlani & Orlow, 2008) . However, reviews on 11 
health behavior  interventions suggest that the evidence relates more to short -term effects rather than 12 
sustained, longer -term impact (Jepson, Harr is, Platt, & Tannahill, 2010). Further, it is suggested that 13 
multi -component programs achieve greater success in changing behavior  (Chase, 2015;  Dadlani & 14 
Orlow, 2008 ). Given that current interventions more commonly employ motivational as opposed to 15 
struct ural or environmental strategies to change behavior , the findings of the current study suggest 16 
that future interventions should complement techniques targeting motivation and planning with 17 
structural and environmental strategies (e.g., prompts or cues to a ctivate implicit constructs for 18 
desired behavior s or structuring the environment so as to make unwanted behavior s difficult) , which 19 
would either activate implicit factors that lead to sun -protective habits or prevent individuals acting 20 
‘mindlessly’. By ide ntifying key theory -based constructs, the findings of the current study can be 21 
translated into practice by linking key predictors identified with relevant behavior  change 22 
techniques (see Kok et al., 2016 ), to develop effective empirical - and theory -based i nterventions to 23 
facilitate parents provision of sun-protection for their young children.  24 
Based on the findings of the current study there are some specific strategies  to consider when 25 
understanding parental sun protection decision s for young children . Firs t, parents should be 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   20 
 provided with choices for performing such behavior s to instil a sense of internal value and interest 1 
toward sun protecting their children , thus improving parents’ ratings of their beliefs toward 2 
behavior al performance. This strategy is  particularly important given that self -determined 3 
motivation drives parents’ intentions via their social -cognitions. Second, strategies to increase 4 
parents’ attitudes  (e.g., information giving) , perceptions of social norms  (e.g., social support 5 
provisions ), and perceptions of control (e.g., behavior al modelling) should be considered to promote  6 
intentions  as a direct predictor of behavior . Third, given  volitional and implicit processes also 7 
emerged as direct predictors of behavior , these processes are also important to consider . Engaging 8 
parents in formulating plans for sun-safety, monitoring their behavior , and providing cues to action 9 
may facilitate greater participation in sun protection behaviors  by parents for their children.  10 
Strengths and Limitations  11 
To date, there is a dearth of research that has investigated how motivational, volitional, and 12 
implicit  processes operate to explain behavior  or that attempt ed to integrate these multiple processes  13 
into a testable model. The current study was the first to  apply a comprehensive IBC model to the 14 
area of sun safety. However, as is the case with most correlational research designs, we recognize 15 
that our results d o not permit the inference of causality on the basis of the data, only theory . Future 16 
research that  attempts to manipulate theoretical constructs and measures their influence on behavior  17 
change is essential in supporting the tenets of the IBC model for this behavior . The current research 18 
does, however, highlight important potential routes to behavior al engagement, which can be used as 19 
a basis for interventions that may be efficacious in eliciting behavior  change.  Moreover, the current 20 
study focused on a key target group, parents  of young children , whose decisions play an important 21 
role in the enforcement  and adoption of their children’s sun -protective behavior s (Hamilton et al., 22 
2016;  Thomson  et al., 2012 ). In addition, a large community -based sample of parents from a region 23 
with a high risk of skin cancer was obtained. These findings and future strategie s could be used for 24 
not only other high risk populations but for various risk populations as well.  25 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   21 
 Despite these strengths, the results should be considered in light of some limitations. 1 
Although various sampling methods  were used , the sample predominately  comprised  married 2 
Caucasian mothers  and the attrition rate was 27%, with a greater proportion of females, non - 3 
Caucasians, full -time employees, and high income earners remaining in the study . Although other 4 
studies have found attrition to be higher among p arent samples and involving multiple follow -ups 5 
(Hamilton, Daniels, Murray, White, & Walsh, 2012; Thomson et al., 2012; Walsh, Hamilton, 6 
White, & Hyde, 2015) , current results may not generali ze across other family structures  and cultural 7 
groups and reflect  predominately the decision  making processes of mothers. Measurement 8 
limitations  also need to be taken into account when interpreting the findings. The study used self- 9 
report measures  of sun -protective behavior , which may be susceptible to social desirabil ity and 10 
recall bias. This was evident by the high means of both intention s and follow -up behavior  observed 11 
in the current study , contrasting to empirical research which suggests fewer  than 50% of parents 12 
reported providing regular sun protection for their children (Johnson, Davy, Boyett, Weathers, & 13 
Roetzheim,  2001 ). Further , reporting behavior  via a telephone follow -up may have induced demand 14 
characteristics, inflating estimates of sun -protective behavior . Although there is no gold standard for 15 
measuring s un protection behavior  (Dadlani & Orlow, 2008), self -report, prospective diaries, and 16 
observation techniques show small positive correlations (Buller & Borland, 1999). In addition, 17 
previous research demonstrates an acceptable overlap between self -report an d objective measures of 18 
sun exposure as well as sun -protective behavior s (Hillhouse, Turrisi, Jaccard, & Robinson, 2012) . 19 
Also, t he item stems of the TPB measures were devised specifically for the target behaviour (albeit 20 
adapted from established TPB guide lines and similar TPB studies). Ideally, some preliminary pilot 21 
testing of these measures would have ensured that the scales were valid and reliable prior to their 22 
use in the current investigation. Finally, in the current study all the sun -protective behav iors were 23 
combined in an overall measure of sun protection . This decision was made based on previous 24 
research suggesting that adequate sun protection does not require performing of all sun -protective 25 
behavior s simultaneously and, thus, separate measures of  individual sun -protective behavior s are 26 
RUNNING HEAD: Child Sun Safety   22 
 not essential to reflect adequate protection (Hamilton et al., 2016; White et al., 2015) . Nevertheless , 1 
given sunscreen is reported as the most common method of sun protection that parents use for their 2 
children (Johnson et al., 2001 ), it may be advantageous for future research to identify parents’ 3 
specific intentions and behavior s by examining individual sun -protective behavior s.  4 
Conclusion  5 
The current study tested an IBC model in a sun  safety context. Overall, we found support for 6 
the majority of the core proposed effects among the motivational, volitional, and implicit factors in 7 
the model, as well as their effects on parents’ behavior for their children’s sun protection. The 8 
current study fills a significant know ledge gap in the literature on the multiple processes that guide 9 
health behavior  and suggests that the  IBC model may have utility in explaining health behavior . 10 
Future research should investigate possible moderators to establish which of the motivational, 11 
volitional, or implicit processes predominate in determining action . Despite the correlational design 12 
of the current study, findings suggest multiple potential routes to behavior al performance that can 13 
serve as a basis for the development of future sun saf ety interventions that are efficacious in 14 
eliciting behavior  change. Future interventions aimed at improving sun -protective practices of 15 
parents for their children should therefore consider the application of an IBC model and the 16 
multiple -processes it advo cates as necessary for motivated action . 17
