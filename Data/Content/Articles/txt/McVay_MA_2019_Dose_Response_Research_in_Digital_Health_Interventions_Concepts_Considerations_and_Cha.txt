Abstract
To optimize digital health interventions, intervention creators must determine what intervention 
dose will produce the most substantial health behavior change—the dose-response relationship—
while minimizing harms or burden. In this manuscript we present important concepts, 
considerations, and challenges in studying dose-response relationships in digital health 
interventions. We propose that interventions make three types of prescriptions: (1) intervention 
action prescriptions , prescriptions to receive content from the intervention, such as to read text or 
listen to audio; (2) participant action prescriptions , prescriptions to produce and provide content to 
the intervention, such as to send text messages or post intervention-requested photos on social 
media; and (3) behavioral target action prescriptions , prescriptions to engage in behaviors outside 
the intervention, such as changing food intake or meditating. Each type of prescription has both an 
intended dose (i.e., what the intervention actually prescribes) and an enacted dose (i.e., what 
portion of the intended dose is actually completed by the participant). Dose parameters of 
duration, frequency, and amount can be applied to each prescription type. We consider adaptive 
interventions and interventions with ad libitum  prescriptions as examples of tailored doses. 
Researchers can experimentally manipulate intended dose to determine the dose-response 
relationship. Enacted dose cannot generally be directly manipulated; however, we consider the 
applicability of “controlled concentration” research design to the study of enacted dose. We 
consider challenges in dose-response research in digital health interventions, including 
characterizing amount with self-paced activities and combining doses across modality. The

Designing digital interventions to improve health behavior requires making decisions about 
how much intervention to deliver and how to distribute that delivery over time. This is a 
matter of designing the intervention dose. Dose, like other elements of digital health 
interventions, should be selected based on empirical evidence of what will produce the most 
substantial behavioral change--the dose-response relationship--while minimizing harms or 
burden. Dose is a critical feature of an intervention. An intervention may be ineffective if the 
dose is too small or too large, even with otherwise perfectly selected and executed behavior 
change techniques. Thus, the study of dose in digital health interventions is essential for 
progress in developing maximally effective digital health interventions. Existing literature on 
the dose-response relationship has primarily focused on traditional intervention modalities 
such as in-person sessions or synchronous telephone calls ( Lin et al., 2014 ; Martín Cantera 
et al., 2015 ; Powers, Vedel, & Emmelkamp, 2008 ). It is not clear if dose-response 
relationships observed in traditional intervention modalities apply to digital health 
interventions, which, more often than traditional interventions, are dynamic, delivered in 
individuals’ natural environments, and are delivered using frequent, brief contacts (e.g., 
daily text messages or social media postings).
The study of dose-response relationships in digital health interventions will be most 
productive if the concept of dose is clearly and consistently operationalized. Existing 
writings on operationalization of dose in behavioral interventions ( Manojlovich & Sidani, 
2008 ; V oils et al., 2012 , 2014 ) do not address how dose concepts and parameters apply to 
digital health interventions. Given the differences between traditional and digital health 
interventions, there is a need to update the conceptualization of dose to better fit elements of 
digital health interventions. Thus, in the current manuscript we present a modified 
conceptualization of dose and provide suggestions for operationalizing and quantifying dose 
in digital health interventions. We purposefully design this conceptualization to apply across 
intervention modalities (including in-person modality) to facilitate discussion among 
researchers working in different modalities and to account for the many interventions that 
involve multiple modalities. After presenting a refined conceptualization of dose, we 
describe how this conceptualization might inform empirical research aiming to identify 
optimal doses for digital health interventions. Finally, we consider challenges that can arise 
when conducting dose-response research in digital health interventions and present strategies 
to overcome these challenges. The aim of our manuscript is to stimulate discussion, rather 
than to present a definitive or prescriptive description of these topics.McVay et al. Page 2

Conceptualizing Dose for Dose-Response Research in Digital Health 
Interventions
Dose, when applied to behavior change interventions, has been described as how much of an 
intervention has been delivered and received ( V oils et al., 2012 , 2014 ). The parameters of 
dose that have been suggested include duration, frequency, and amount ( Manojlovich & 
Sidani, 2008 ; V oils et al., 2012 ). Duration is the total length of time over which an 
intervention is delivered; frequency is how often contact is made; and amount is the length 
of each contact. For example, an intervention can deliver content for a duration of six 
months at a frequency of twice per week, with each contact having an amount of one hour. 
Total number of contacts can be described by multiplying duration and frequency, while the 
total dose can be described by multiplying duration, frequency, and amount ( V oils et al., 
2012 ). Other ways of characterizing dose are tailored versus untailored and fixed versus 
variable ( V oils et al., 2012 ). An intervention with a tailored dose provides different doses to 
different individuals based on individual characteristics, whereas an untailored dose provides 
the same dose across all participants. An intervention with a variable dose provides different 
doses across time during the intervention, whereas a fixed dose provides a consistent dose 
across time.
Determining What Counts Towards Dose in Digital Health Intervention.
A central challenge in applying these dose parameters to digital health interventions is 
determining to which components of the intervention dose should be applied. To explore this 
potential challenge, we consider the example of Track , a digital health intervention for 
weight loss among adults with obesity developed by Bennett and colleagues (2018) . In 
Track, participants are assigned individualized diet and physical activity goals informed by 
their response to a series of questions. On a weekly basis, they receive a text message or an 
Interactive V oice Response (IVR) message (modality of message is based on participant 
preference) requesting that they report their progress on these goals over the prior week. 
They then have the opportunity to text or verbally respond to the IVR system to indicate 
extent of achievement of their goal. Based on their responses, the intervention sends a text or 
IVR message to the participant with feedback to encourage future goal attainment. The 
Track intervention also includes 30-minute counseling phone calls with a coach that occur 
every two weeks initially then every four weeks. To apply the dose parameters of frequency, 
amount, and duration to Track, one must first decide to which intervention elements these 
parameters apply. With Track, dose can apply to: texts/IVR calls sent by the intervention to 
the participant asking about goal attainment; texts/IVR calls sent by the participant to the 
intervention to report their goal attainment; texts/IVR calls sent by the intervention to the 
participant containing tailored feedback; counseling calls; and/or those activities that 
participants do in response to the intervention, such as walking more or increasing the 
frequency of grocery shopping. If dose can be applied to all of these components, then one 
must consider if they should be combined to provide one total dose of the intervention or if 
there are meaningful differences in these components that warrant presenting dose 
separately for different components.McVay et al. Page 3

To determine what counts towards dose, it may be useful to focus on the behavioral 
prescription of the intervention—i.e., what the intervention asks the participants to do. 
Interventions’ behavioral prescriptions can be grouped into three meaningful categories: (1) 
prescriptions that participants receive content from the intervention, which can be called 
intervention action prescription ; (2) prescriptions that participants produce and provide 
content to the intervention, which can be called participant action prescription ; (3) 
prescriptions that participants engage in behaviors outside the intervention, which can be 
called behavioral target prescription  (see Figure 1). There are commonalities of this 
categorization with existing conceptualizations of behavioral interventions. For example, the 
expert-developed ORBIT model of intervention development and testing distinguishes 
between the delivery of intervention and the behaviors in which participants engage (i.e., the 
behavioral targets; Czajkowski et al., 2015 ). Additionally, researchers in the area of 
intervention fidelity have distinguished between the delivery of the intervention and the 
receipt of the intervention ( Bellg et al., 2004 ). In the next section, each of the three proposed 
prescriptions are considered in detail.
Intervention action prescription.— Intervention action prescription  refers to the 
intervention content participants are asked to receive. Depending on the modality, receiving 
can involve reading content (e.g., reading a mobile application notification), listening to 
content (e.g., listening to a message on a smart speaker), viewing content (e.g., watching a 
video in a social media feed), or some combination of these actions. Intervention action 
prescriptions are often stated explicitly by the intervention. For example, when individuals 
enroll in an intervention, they may be instructed to attend a one-hour group session each 
week for eight weeks, to enter a virtual reality world for 30 minutes once per week, or to 
log-in to their Twitter account daily to read messages from the study group. In some cases, 
the intervention action prescription is prescribed not only through explicit communication, 
but also is “pushed” by the intervention to participants ( Klasnja & Pratt, 2012 ). Pushing 
content refers to a practice used by many digital health interventions in which content is 
delivered in a way that is intended to be integrated into their typical technology usage and 
thus is difficult to ignore. Examples include sending an email to a regularly used e-mail 
account, placing a post to appear in participants’ stream of social media, or sending a text 
message or an app notification to participants’ smart phones. The Track intervention, 
described previously, pushes text messages to participants’ smart phones; participants are 
thus prescribed to read these messages and respond accordingly.
Participant action prescription.— Participant action prescription  refers to what the 
intervention asks the participant to produce and deliver in response to the intervention. 
Examples of participant action prescriptions include requesting a participant to send a text 
message indicating progress on a goal (as in the Track example); prompting participants to 
post a photo of themselves exercising on social media; encouraging participants to “talk” to 
a virtual person while in a virtual reality world; or asking participants to make an audio 
recording describing their mood.
Some interventions involve rapid exchange between interdependent intervention actions and 
participant actions. For example, a text messaging intervention can involve a constant McVay et al. Page 4
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
exchange of texts with an interventionist (or bot). In the proposed framework, texts sent by 
the intervention comprise the intervention action prescription , and the request that the 
participant will respond is the participant action prescription . Describing the dose of these 
frequent, interdependent interactions poses a challenge, which is considered later.
Behavioral target prescription.— Behavioral target prescription  refers to requests by the 
intervention to engage in the health behavioral targets of the intervention. This can include 
instructions to meditate twice a day; requests to consume more fruits and vegetables; or 
reminders to participants to take their medications. Behavioral target prescriptions may 
require intermediary behaviors that are implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 
participants in the Track program may be assigned the goal of eating at least three fruits and 
vegetables per day; this also has the implicit prescription that the individual may need to go 
to the grocery store to buy these fruits and vegetables. On occasion, an intervention may 
influence individuals to engage in behaviors that are not directly prescribed by the 
intervention. For example, an intervention focused on stress reduction may inspire a 
participant to start using a meditation app, even if meditation was not prescribed. This 
“spontaneous” engagement in health-related activities (digitally mediated or otherwise) can 
be observed and described by the research team; however, because it does not involve 
prescribed activities, it would not count as part of dose in the present conceptualization.
The dose of the behavioral target prescriptions may have an important influence on 
outcomes, as it contributes to the total amount of time a participant devotes to the 
intervention. In the remainder of this manuscript, we focus on intervention and participant 
action prescriptions because they involve direct interaction between the participant and the 
intervention.
Intended and enacted dose for intervention and participant action prescriptions.
Previous conceptualizations of dose distinguished between how much intervention was 
intended by the intervention developers or implementers, called intended dose , and how 
much was actually received by the participants, called received dose  (Saunders, Evans, & 
Joshi, 2005 ; V oils et al., 2012 ). These dose concepts can be applied to digital health 
interventions, and can be applied separately to the intervention action prescription and the 
participant action prescription (see Table 1). Enacted dose  is used herein in place of received 
dose because it is inclusive of both intervention action and participant action prescriptions. 
These types of doses can be described using the dose parameters previously presented—
frequency, amount, and duration.
Application of the dose parameter amount to digital health interventions is worth additional 
consideration. Describing the dose amount can be challenging in some digital health 
interventions, owing to the self-paced nature of many elements (e.g., reading of texts, 
navigating interactive web interventions) and individual differences (e.g., reading speed). 
For textual content, it may be sufficient to describe amount in terms of the number of words 
or characters. In other cases, it may be useful to convert written and other digital health 
content to a time unit, such as when comparing across different formats. Given that the 
average reader with an eighth grade level of education can read about 150 words per minute McVay et al. Page 5
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
(Hasbrouck & Tindal, 2015.), one approach to translating textual data into time units is to 
describe content with 150 words or less as having an amount of one minute and content over 
150 words a time value based on 150 words/minute. Alternatively, a time unit for an 
intervention can be estimated by having a small sample of participants complete an 
intervention task, perhaps during pilot testing, to identify an average or range of times.
Case studies.— We now present case studies to demonstrate the application of these dose 
parameters on digital health interventions. Consider again the Track intervention. One of the 
prescriptions is for participants to read weekly brief text messages (about 20–30 words) 
asking about goal progress. This is an intervention action prescription because the 
intervention is asking participants to receive this intervention content. The intended dose of 
this component can be characterized as duration of 12 months and frequency of once per 
week. The amount can be summarized as one minute based on the number of words 
presented to participants. The enacted intervention prescription dose for this intervention is 
how many of these IVR messages were listened to or text messages were read. The 
feasibility of determining the enacted dose varies depending on the technology used. In this 
example, the portion of IVR calls answered may be easy to obtain and provide a partial 
indicator of enacted dose for those participants who selected the IVR mode. With use of 
certain technology, it is also possible to determine if a text message was viewed.
Track participants are also asked to send a weekly text message indicating if they met their 
goals. This is a participant action prescription  because they are asked to provide content to 
the intervention. The intended duration of this prescription is 12 months and frequency is 
once per week. There is no pre-specified number of words requested from participants, 
making the assignment of an intended amount unclear. However, given that the mode is 
texting and that participants are asked to answer a brief question, it can be assumed that the 
amount is one minute. Alternatively, the amount parameter may be deemed irrelevant to this 
particular intervention. The enacted dose of this participant action prescription can be 
determined by recording how many responses were sent to the intervention.
We next consider another digital health intervention, Tweet2Quit, a social media-based 
smoking cessation intervention that has been piloted ( Pechmann, Delucchi, Lakon, & 
Prochaska, 2017 ) and is now being tested in a fully powered randomized controlled trial. 
Tweet2Quit intervention components include: a one-time automated email encouraging 
participants to start tweeting at least daily; a series of five automated emails with links to 
smokefree.gov  modules (delivered at varying intervals); daily “auto-question” tweets to the 
group from the intervention; and daily “auto-feedback” text messages, sent to participants’ 
smart phones that encourage them to tweet. The intended intervention action prescription is 
as follows: (1) read automated emails and modules at smokefree.gov , which has a variable 
dose with a duration of 22 days and average frequency of every 5.5 days; (2) read Twitter 
auto-question messages, which have a duration of 100 days and frequency of daily; and (3) 
read auto-feedback text messages, which have a duration of 100 days and frequency of daily. 
The enacted intervention action of reading the smokefree.gov  module can be partially 
estimated by determining how often the modules sent via email were opened. However, it 
may not be feasible to determine if the tweets were read. For Tweet2quit, the intended 
participant action prescription is to tweet daily over the course of the intervention, which has McVay et al. Page 6
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
a duration of 100 days and frequency of once per day. The amount parameter for this 
prescription can be expressed in number of words prescribed to read or translated into a 
minute unit. The enacted participant action dose in this example is how much the 
participants tweet; the authors reported that an average of 72 tweets were written per 
participant, out of the prescribed 100 ( Pechmann, Delucchi, Lakon, & Prochaska, 2017 ). 
Note that this value combines frequency (1/day) and duration (100 days) to provide total 
number of contacts.
Tailored and ad libitum interventions.— Digital health interventions have substantial 
promise for facilitating interventions that are precisely tailored to characteristics of the 
participants—that is, adaptive interventions. Examples of adaptive intervention approaches 
include just-in-time adaptive interventions ( Nahum-Shani et al., 2016 .) and control systems 
engineering-based approaches ( Hekler et al., 2018 ). Adaptive interventions can tailor both 
the content and the intended dose. Consider an intervention that aims to improve adherence 
to oral medication for patients with diabetes by delivering a text message reminder only 
when the electronic pill container is not opened in a pre-specified time ( Vervloet et al., 
2012 ). The intended intervention action frequency can be described as 0–1 times/day. 
Describing the enacted dose of tailored interventions requires additional considerations. It 
may be most appropriate for enacted dose to be presented in relation to the intended dose for 
each particular participant based on the tailoring schema used. Alternatively, a range of 
enacted doses can be presented.
One important sub-type of tailored dose is ad libitum , in which no specific dosage of use is 
prescribed. Rather, with ad libitum  prescriptions participants either are instructed to use the 
intervention according to their need or desire or are not given any explicit instructions on 
usage frequency, amount, or duration. All or just some components of an intervention may 
have an ad libitum  dose. Consider as an example Healthy Mind, an app-based intervention 
that includes nine different stress management tools ( Morrison et al. 2017 ). Healthy Mind 
participants are informed that they can use these tools “on demand” and are sent periodic 
push notification messages encouraging use of the tools. A dose can be described for both 
the push notifications and for the stress management tools. The dose of the push 
notifications may be described in terms of the standard parameters of frequency, duration, 
and amount. Describing the dose of the stress management tool component is less 
straightforward. The prescription for these tools may be best described as having a minimum 
dose corresponding to the dose of the notifications sent (since these notifications are 
functioning as “prescriptions”) as well as having an ad libitum  dose beyond that minimum 
dose (since participants can use the tools beyond those times when they receive push 
notifications).
Passively acquired data.— Some interventions collect data on participant behavior that 
does not require participant input, such as step counts or Global Positioning System (GPS) 
location acquired from a smart phone. In many cases, these data are used to provide tailored 
intervention content. As an example, the HeartStep intervention uses automatically acquired 
geolocation information and other data to tailor the content, timing, and frequency of 
physical activity recommendations ( Klasnja et al 2018 ). Thus, different doses of intervention McVay et al. Page 7
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
are delivered across individuals and across time. Although passively acquired data can 
influence dose, the acquired data are not counted as part of the intervention dose per the 
currently presented conceptualization because there is no action prescribed to the 
participant.
Implications for the Empirical Study of Dose
Intended Dose
Researchers interested in optimizing intervention dose can manipulate the intended 
intervention action dose and/or the intended participant action dose and observe outcomes of 
interest ( V oils et al., 2012 ). With regard to intervention action dose, researchers can 
systematically vary what is asked of participants to receive. For example, researchers can 
randomize individuals to be asked to complete daily or weekly virtual reality sessions or to 
receive a text message daily or weekly. Morrison et al. (2017)  randomized participants to 
three different doses of app notifications in the previously described Healthy Minds 
intervention: daily, every 72 hours, or at intervals tailored based on participant data. While 
this is an example of testing frequency, other dose parameters can be varied. For example, a 
three-level factorial study can vary the prescription of duration (12 vs. 24 weeks), frequency 
(one per week vs. once per day), and amount (one vs. three minutes).
As with intervention action dose, the effects of participant action dose  on outcomes can be 
studied by systematically varying what participants are prescribed to produce. In the 
Tweet2quit intervention, researchers can examine effects of requesting that participants write 
one tweet per week versus one tweet per day. Factorial design can be used to simultaneously 
manipulate both intervention and participant action dose. For example, a currently ongoing 
study by Bennett and colleagues ( Bennett, 2018 ) is varying whether individuals are sent 
texts once per week or daily; this is a test of the intervention action prescription dose. In the 
same study, they are also randomizing individuals to different prescribed frequency of 
response; this is a test of participation action prescription dose. For interventions with 
tailored doses, researchers can utilize experimental studies to determine the most effective 
tailoring schema. For example, researchers can systematically vary different tailoring 
schemes and ranges of intended dose. In addition to these experimental methods, researchers 
can use non-randomized approaches to evaluate dose-response for intended intervention 
action and participant action prescriptions (see V oils et al., 2012 , 2014 ).
Dose can also be categorized and studied based on the specific behavior change techniques 
used ( Tate et al., 2016 ). In the Track intervention, for example, dose can be described 
separately for self-monitoring technique and feedback on self-monitoring. Many digital 
health intervention modalities lend themselves to this fine-grained analysis and thus provide 
an opportunity for further probing of mechanisms of change.
Enacted Dose
Unlike manipulating intended dose, researchers cannot directly manipulate enacted dose 
because the enacting is at the discretion of the participant. Thus, research on the relation McVay et al. Page 8
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
between enacted dose and response is necessarily observational and subject to limitations in 
identifying causal relationships.
The difficulty of determining the relationship between enacted dose and outcomes has a 
parallel in the field of clinical pharmacology. In clinical pharmacology, investigators are 
interested in understanding how specific blood concentrations of a drug (vs. the amount of 
drug ingested or administered) influence clinical outcomes. This is challenging, however, 
because individual differences in metabolism of the same delivered drug dose can result in 
different blood concentrations, biasing estimates of the blood concentration-outcomes 
relationship. A parallel in digital health interventions is that the same intended dose can 
result in different enacted dose due to individual differences, biasing estimates of the enacted 
dose-outcome relationship. In clinical pharmacology, this challenge has been addressed via 
concentration-controlled trials ( Sanathanan & Peck, 1991 ), in which participants are 
randomized to a specified blood concentration of a drug, their blood concentration levels are 
continuously monitored, and the delivered dose is adjusted to achieve the assigned blood 
concentration. A parallel design in digital health behavioral interventions might involve 
randomizing participants to a targeted enacted dose, continuously monitoring their achieved 
enacted dose, and delivering more dose as needed to obtain the assigned enacted dose. For 
example, consider a study aiming to compare daily versus weekly viewing (i.e., enacted 
dose) of smoking cessation motivational messages that are delivered by participants clicking 
on a web link embedded in text messages. A concentration-controlled design might involve 
monitoring participants’ opening of the web link and sending additional text messages in 
order to obtain the assigned amount of enacted dose. Such an approach is consistent with an 
adaptive design, in which participants may receive different intervention elements as a 
function of their initial response to an intervention. A potential challenge with this approach 
is that participants who are not initially engaging may not be responsive to efforts to increase 
engagement. Additionally, for this approach to work there must be an accurate indicator of 
enacted dose that can be continuously monitored.
Researchers can also study enacted dose by manipulating intervention features that are 
hypothesized to effect enacted dose. For example, researchers may hypothesize that 
participants will be more likely to read a text and respond to a text (i.e., have a greater 
enacted dose) if it is delivered at certain times of day. To test this, the researchers can 
randomize participants to be sent texts at different times of day and examine effects on 
enacted dose and clinical outcomes of interest.
One notable intervention characteristic that may affect enacted dose is the intended dose of 
the intervention ( V oils et al., 2014 ). Intended dose may affect enacted dose by setting 
expectation of participants’ actions and by providing an upper limit on the dose (i.e., highest 
possible amount of content in which they can engage). Further, an intended dose that is very 
low may lead to a lack of engagement in the intervention, thus leading to less enacted dose. 
Alternatively, an intended dose may be high enough that it is viewed as burdensome or 
annoying, leading to withdrawal and a lower enacted dose, or lack of willingness to initiate 
the intervention in the first place ( V oils et al., 2014 ; see further discussion below). Thus, 
researchers manipulating intended dose in an experimental design should examine the effect McVay et al. Page 9
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
on enacted dose to help guide interpretations of outcomes and refine intervention dose for 
future studies.
The concepts of enacted dose and intervention engagement  are closely related. While 
intervention engagement in digital health has been defined in many ways, a recent literature 
review developed an integrative definition of engagement that proposes two elements: extent 
of usage of an intervention, and subjective experience characterized by “attention, interest, 
and affect.” ( Perski, Blandford, West, & Michie, 2017 ). Enacted dose as presented here has 
complete conceptual overlap with the usage component of engagement but does not overlap 
with the subjective experience portion. Researchers focusing on the usage components of 
engagement may consider applying the concepts outlined herein by distinguishing between 
engagement with the intervention action prescription and participant action prescription.
Intervention Burden and Adverse Events
Adverse events, unanticipated problems, and intervention burden are integral to consider 
when designing an intervention. An adverse event is an “untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence,” physical or psychological, attributed to an intervention ( Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks & Adverse Events Guidance, 2007 ). Intervention burden is a 
subjective experience of the participant in which the intervention requirements are greater 
than the participants’ resources at a point in time ( Nahum-Shani et al., 2016 .). Burden and 
adverse events can be influenced by characteristics of the individual (e.g., monetary 
resources, motivation), the environment, and the intervention. Notably, intervention-related 
burden and risk of adverse events may differ for in-person compared to digital health 
interventions. For example, an in-person intervention may be perceived as burdensome if it 
requires a long drive to an intervention site. A digital health intervention may be perceived 
as burdensome if it interrupts participants’ daily activities with intrusive notifications 
(Dennison, Morrison, Conway, & Yardley, 2013 ). Intervention burden and adverse events are 
undesirable on their own accord and may make an intervention less effective, such as by 
leading to intervention disengagement. Potentially, burden and adverse events can be 
influenced by the intended dose of all three types of intervention prescriptions (intervention 
action, participant action, and behavioral target). Researchers can systematically measure 
how intended dose affects experience of burden and enacted dose, and if burden mediates 
relationships between intended dose and outcomes.
Overcoming Challenges in the Empirical Study of Dose-Response 
Relationships.
Combining Dose Prescriptions across Modalities.
Many digital health interventions use multiple modalities. For example, Track uses both text 
messages and counseling calls, while Tweet2quit sends text messages and tweets. When 
studying the dose of these interventions, should these modalities be combined to make a 
complete dose or should the dose of each be separately described? The answer should 
depend on the purpose of the research study. On some occasions, researchers may wish to 
study the dose of specific modalities separately. In other cases, the total dose of an McVay et al. Page 10
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
intervention across modalities may be of interest, for example, if the goal is to compare an 
overall low dose and high dose.
Describing Dose When Intervention and Participant Action Prescriptions Occur in 
Interdependent Bursts.
As previously noted, some interventions include components for which the intervention 
actions and participant actions are interdependent and occur in rapid succession, such as 
with a series of text messages from the intervention and participant, or conversations in a 
virtual world (or real world) that typically involve inter-dependent exchanges of participant 
and intervention actions. When conducting experimental studies, it may not be possible or 
desired to control the total number of exchanges in these interactions. Instead, researchers 
might focus on manipulating the frequency with which new bursts of communication are 
started. For example, if researchers send text messages offering to engage in back-and-forth 
dialogue to help with problem solving, they may be interested in varying if that initial text is 
sent daily or three times a week (and ignoring the number of contacts within that burst of 
communication). If studying enacted dose in these types of exchanges, however, researchers 
may consider more fine-grained relationships.
Conclusions
Most research in dose-response relationship has focused on in-person modalities. As a 
result, little is known about the optimal doses for digital health interventions. Further, 
current treatment guidelines suggest doses based on research from in-person interventions, 
which may not be appropriate for digital health interventions. Further discussion about dose 
in digital health interventions and more dose-response research is warranted to optimize the 
impact of digital health interventions.
