Abstract
Objective— Coaction refers to the extent to which taking action on one behavior increases the
odds of taking action on a second behavior. This integrative study examines the generalization of
coaction in three studies on weight-related behaviors.
Methods— Data from three randomized trials of tailored interventions (n=1277, n=1800, and
n=6000) were examined to determine if coaction of behavior change occurred differentially in
treatment and control groups. In each analysis, the likelihood of progressing to the Action or
Maintenance stages for the target behaviors was evaluated using logistic regression.
Results— Despite differences in populations, targeted behaviors, levels of tailoring in
interventions, and timing of follow-up assessments, 17 out of 24 (70.8%) logistic regressions
revealed significant coaction in the treatment group as opposed to only 3 out of 24 (12.5%) in the
control condition. In 23/24 analyses, coaction of behavior change was larger on an absolute basis
in the treatment group. Individuals in the treatment group progressing to Action/Maintenance for
one behavior were 1.4 – 5 times more likely to make progress on another behavior compared to
those in the treatment group who did not make such progress on the first behavior.
Conclusions— This study demonstrates that despite considerable variability in study design,
coaction reliably occurs more in the presence of Transtheoretical-Model based multiple behavior

areas and to examine the predictors of differential coaction. The ability to consistently create
coaction within multiple behavior interventions can increase the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
multiple behavior change interventions.

Effective weight management interventions hinge on changing multiple behaviors. The need
for multiple behavior change interventions has been highlighted in several studies. Reeves
and Rafferty (2005), for example, reported that only 3% of US adults report engaging in
regular exercise, non-smoking, being at a healthy weight, and consuming adequate fruit and
vegetables. Over 96% of a sample of 434 primary care patients with hypertension or
diabetes had 3 or more health behavior risks (Lawler, Winkler, Reeves, Owen, Graves, &
Eakin, 2010), which is an all too common finding among overweight primary care patients
(Sanchez et al., 2008).
Two recent studies (Appel et al., 2011; Wadden et al., 2011) demonstrate the effectiveness
of interventions targeting dietary intake and physical activity among patients recruited from
such practices. Appel et al. (2011) reported that two behavioral interventions for obesity
comprised of telephonic support and an online weight management program offered with or
without in-person support led to significant weight loss among the treatment groups relative
to the comparison group who received only brief advice. The Look AHEAD Research
Group (2010) examined the effectiveness of a multiple behavior change intervention in over
5100 overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes over a four-year period. The intensive
lifestyle intervention, which included dietary modification (calorie and fat reduction
facilitated by a portion controlled diet) and 175 minutes of physical activity per week, with
an emphasis on behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and problem
solving, was compared to standard diabetes education. As expected, the lifestyle
intervention led to significant improvements on weight loss, fitness, and a number of clinical
outcomes.
While those studies underscore the viability and effectiveness of multiple behavior change
interventions, they shed insufficient light on potential mechanisms of multiple behavior
change (MBC). Research on maximizing the effect of multiple behavior change MBC
interventions is becomingly increasingly common and sophisticated (Prochaska, Spring, &
Nigg, 2008) and is a high priority for NIH (NIH, 2010). Numerous studies (e.g., Jones, et al.,
2003; Prochaska et al., 2004; 2005; Johnson et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2008) indicate that
the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) is an effective model for tailoring
MBC interventions. The TTM is an integrative model of behavior change that incorporates
process oriented variables to explain and predict how and when individuals change
behaviors. In addition to the central organizing construct, stage of change, the TTM tailors
interventions based on other behavior change constructs including decisional balance,
processes of change, and self-efficacy (Prochaska, Redding, & Evers, 2002). PreviousJohnson et al. Page 2
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
research on the generalizable and consistent relationships between TTM constructs, such as
stage and decisional balance (Prochaska, 2004; Prochaska et al., 1994; Hall & Rossi, 2008),
has informed the development of evidence-based interventions.
Beyond the use of a guiding theoretical model for tailoring interventions, best practices that
will allow us to maximize the potential and cost-effectiveness of MBC interventions are
only beginning to emerge. Prochaska (2008) identified co-variation, or coaction, of behavior
change as a promising innovation for advancing the field. Coaction refers to the finding that
taking action on one treated behavior significantly increases the odds of taking effective
action on a second treated behavior. Rather than comparing between groups who received
treatment or no treatment, assessments of coaction examine the likelihood of success in
changing a second targeted behavior once one behavior has been changed within  treatment
or control groups. Coaction assumes co-occurrence clusters in at-risk individuals at baseline,
but focuses on how behaviors within such clusters change together or independently at
follow-up. Potential theoretical mechanisms that might contribute to coaction include
increased self-efficacy (Bandura, 1974) for one behavior increasing self-efficacy to change
another; the Theory of Triadic Influence (Flay & Petraitis, 1994); transfer effects (Lippke,
Nigg, & Maddock, 2012); or generalizing principles of behavior change from the
Transtheoretical Model.
Research on MBC interventions revealed that adults receiving fully tailored
Transtheoretical-Model (TTM)-based interventions for smoking, dietary fat reduction, and
sun exposure were 1.63–1.85 times more likely to take action on a second behavior at 24
months if they took action on any one of the treated behaviors. In contrast, individuals in the
usual care comparison group were less likely than those in the treatment group to take action
on a second behavior if they took action on one (odds ratio (OR) = 1.1–1.2) (Paiva et al.,
2012).
While other single studies (e.g., Johnson et al., 2008; Mauriello et al. 2010) have reported
that coaction occurs in the context of TTM-based tailored MBC interventions and Paiva et
al. (2012) reported coaction among adult samples in studies employing the same
intervention protocol, this study represents the first to systematically examine the
consistency and magnitude of coaction across three randomized trials involving different
populations (i.e., adults, high school students and middle school students); tailoring
protocols (i.e., fully tailored interventions for all behaviors and a combination of fully and
optimally tailored interventions; different timing); delivery channels (home-based vs. school
based); follow-up assessment schedules (i.e., 12–24 months); and target behaviors. Thus, the
results will provide unique insights into the stability of coaction. Demonstrating the
consistent presence of coaction despite the considerable variability in study designs and
targeted populations could inform future studies and interventions and lead to an even
greater public health impact of MBC interventions. The results will also permit comparisons
of the magnitude of coaction effects on behaviors that are integrated around a theme (energy
balance) to behaviors that are considered less related (e.g., smoking and exercise). All three
studies addressed one of the leading public health challenges of our time: intervening on
multiple behaviors related to weight management in adults or obesity prevention in youth.
Each of the three studies addressed two crucial behaviors for obesity prevention or weightJohnson et al. Page 3

management: dietary modification (calorie reduction and dietary fat reduction for the adults;
fruit and vegetable intake for the adolescents) and physical activity. The adult weight
management study also addressed reducing emotional eating, whereas the adolescent obesity
prevention studies included an intervention to reduce TV time.
Methods
Subjects & Procedure
Data from three studies (Johnson et al., 2008; Mauriello et al., 2010; Velicer et al., 2011) are
reported here. In Study 1 (Johnson et al., 2008), a national sample of 1277 overweight and
obese adults (mean age = 45.37; mean BMI = 30.75; (BMI range = 25–39.9); 48% female;
79.1% White, 6.5% Black, 7% Hispanic, 7.2% Other) were randomized to receive either
usual care or fully tailored TTM-based feedback reports for up to three risk behaviors based
on the national guidelines at the time: healthy eating (reducing caloric intake by 500 calories
per day and total fat intake to less than 30% of calories), regular exercise (30 minutes of
moderate exercise on at least 5 days a week), and managing emotions without eating. Fully
tailored reports provided feedback on stage of change, decisional balance, self-efficacy, and
up to 6 stage matched processes. A participant received a fully tailored report for each of the
behaviors for which they were in Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, or Action
(i.e., those who were not engaging in regular exercise, healthy eating, and/or managing
emotional distress or who had recently adopted the behavior(s) were classified as “at risk”
and received an intervention for those behavior(s)). Therefore, they could have received
between one and three reports at each timepoint. Intervention materials, including a stage-
matched manual addressing the targeted behaviors, were delivered by mail based on
assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. Control participants completed assessments at
baseline and 6 months. Follow-up assessments were conducted with all participants at 12
and 24 months (see Figure 1). Additional details about the participants and design are
reported elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2008).
In Study 2 (Mauriello et al., 2010), 1800 high school students from 8 schools in the US
(mean age = 15.97; 50.8% female; 71.5% White, 10.5% Black, 5.5% Hispanic, 12.4%
Other; 74.7% normal weight) were randomized to receive either assessment only (baseline
and 2 months) or an Internet delivered, TTM-based multiple behavior change obesity
prevention program ( Health In Motion ) targeting exercise (60 minutes on at least 5 days of
the week), fruit and vegetable consumption (5 servings daily), and reducing TV time (less
than 2 hours per day) at baseline, 1 month, and 2 months. The interventions included a
combination of fully tailored interventions for exercise and alternating optimally tailored
and stage-matched interventions for fruit and vegetable intake and TV time. Optimally
tailored interventions, offered first for fruit and vegetable intake, included feedback on stage
of change, decisional balance (pros), and stage-matched feedback on processes of change.
Stage-matched interventions included feedback on stage and stage-matched feedback on
processes of change. Each student received intervention messages for all three behaviors. As
Figure 2 depicts, follow-up assessments were administered to all participants at 6 and 12
months. Additional details about the study have been reported previously (Mauriello et al.,
2010).Johnson et al. Page 4

Study 3 (Velicer et al., in press) included 4,151 middle school students from 20 schools in
Rhode Island (mean age = 11.40; 52.3% male; 62.3% White, 3.8% Black, 12.5% Hispanic,
21.4% Other; 88.5% normal weight). The Health in Motion  obesity prevention program
(described above) was offered to the comparison group of students in an alcohol and
smoking prevention study. Students completed annual assessments of stage of change for
each behavior and participated in one multi-media intervention session during Year 1, three
sessions during Year 2, and one session in Year 3. Students participating in Health In
Motion received intervention messages for all three behaviors at each intervention timepoint
as is shown in Figure 3. Final follow-up assessment is ongoing. Analyses reported here will
be restricted to complete case data from the first two years of the study.
For each study, all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Pro-
Change Behavior Systems, Inc. or the University of Rhode Island.
Statistical Analyses
To determine if coaction of behavior change occurred differentially in treatment and control
groups, the likelihood of progressing to Action or Maintenance (A/M) for each pair of target
behaviors was evaluated by logistic regression analyses that provided odds ratios (OR) with
95% confidence intervals for each group. Only individuals in a pre-action stage (i.e.,
Precontemplation, Contemplation, or Preparation) for both behaviors at baseline were
included in each logistic regression for each timepoint. In Study 1, for example, coaction
was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months among individuals who at baseline were in a pre-action
stage for two behaviors. In all analyses, failing to progress was the referent category. While
results are reported in one direction, the converse of each odds ratio is also true. In Study 1,
for example, the OR at six months for a participant taking action on healthy eating if they
took action on exercise is 2.52 (1.4–4.5), which is equivalent to the OR that a participant
taking action on healthy eating would take action on exercise at that timepoint. Thus, the
logistic regressions are not comparing individuals in the treatment group to those in the
comparison group, but rather comparing within each group the probability of taking action
on a second behavior if a participant took action on one behavior.
Results
Tables 1–3 present the results of the logistic regressions for each behavior combination for
each of the studies.
Study 1
Receiving fully-tailored interventions for up to three behaviors related to weight
management produced odds ratios from 2.52–5.18 that taking action on one behavior would
lead to taking action on a second treated behavior. Smaller odds ratios (1.24 to 2.63)
emerged among those in the usual care comparison group. Eight out of 9 logistic regressions
conducted among those in the treatment group revealed significant co-action, as compared to
only 3 out of 9 in the usual care comparison group. On an absolute basis, the ORs for those
in the treatment group were higher in 8/9 analyses (see Table 1).Johnson et al. Page 5
Health Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
Study 2
Taking action on a single behavior increased the likelihood of taking action on another
behavior among participants in the treatment group, but not among those in the comparison
group. The ORs were higher among the treatment group than among the comparison group
on an absolute basis in all logistic regressions. The ORs for coaction of all behavior pairs
were significant at 2 months (end of intervention) and at 6 months among treatment group
participants. The OR for coaction of fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity was also
significant at 12 months in the treatment group. Those progressing to A/M in the treatment
group were 1.4 – 4.2 times more likely to progress to A/M for a second behavior and had
significant ORs in 7/9 analyses, while the ORs for coaction in the comparison group were
not significant for any behavior pair at any time point (0/9) (see Table 2).
Study 3
At 12 months, the treatment group ORs for moving to action on one behavior if moved on
another behavior was higher than those of control group participants for all behavior pairs.
The coaction was significant for either behavior paired with exercise, but not for the fruit
and vegetable and TV time pairing. Similar results were seen at 24 months. In total, 2 out of
6 analyses revealed significant coaction among treatment group participants, as opposed to
0/6 for comparison group participants. As Table 3 outlines, in 6 out of 6 analyses, the
treatment group had higher OR on an absolute basis.
Across all three studies, the odds of taking action on one behavior after having taken on
another behavior were higher for treatment group participants receiving tailored
interventions in 23 out of 24 analyses. Significant co-action occurred in 17 out of 24 of the
analyses among treatment group participants as opposed to 3 out of 24 analyses for the
comparison group participants.
Discussion
Few previous studies have documented the effect changing one behavior can have on the
potential to change another. In this study, coaction was consistently demonstrated across
three studies intervening on a range of energy balance behaviors that involved diverse
populations (overweight adults, high school students, and middle school students ) and
conducted follow-ups as far out as 24 months. Clear commonalities regarding coaction
included significant ORs for the likelihood of treatment group participants moving to A/M
for one behavior when they progressed to A/M on a behavior in 17 out of 24 analyses, as
opposed to only 3 out of 24 analyses for comparison group participants.
The consistency with which coaction occurred offers exciting innovations for MBC research
because of the potential for coaction to increase treatment impact and reduce response
burden and costs of MBC interventions. This increased impact does not, however, have to
increase demand or cost exponentially in that the results in Studies 2 and 3 indicated that
briefer optimally tailored or stage-matched interventions resulted in coaction when paired
with fully tailored interventions. In other words, coaction occurs in the context of fully
tailored interventions for all behaviors (Study 1), as well as when fully tailored interventionsJohnson et al. Page 6

are paired with optimally or minimally tailored materials (Studies 2 & 3). Thus, the results
have implications for beginning to establish best practices in MBC interventions. Given that
various intensities of tailoring (full tailoring in the adult weight study and a combination of
full, optimal, and minimal tailoring in the high school and middle school obesity prevention
studies) produced consistently higher ORs in the treatment group than in the comparison
group, tailoring on relevant behavior change variables may be a minimum requirement for
successful MBC interventions. Noar, Benac & Harris (2007) reported that tailoring on 5–7
variables in TTM-based interventions is as effective as tailoring on 6–9 behavior change
constructs, lending further support to an optimal tailoring approach. Future research needs to
explore what the most efficacious combinations of tailored interventions are.
Various explanations for the consistent demonstration of coaction have been suggested
(Noar, Chabot, & Zimmerman, 2008; Fleig, Lippke, Pomp, & Schwarzer, 2011; Lippke,
Nigg & Maddock, 2012). One such explanation hypothesizes that individuals have increased
self-efficacy as a result of changing one behavior that spills over onto another behavior.
Fleig et al. (2011) reported that transfer effects offer another plausible explanation. Transfer
refers to the process when lessons learned in one context are applied to another context
(Barnett & Ceci, 2002)—or in this case, the extent to which knowledge and skills from one
behavior change assists with another (Nigg, Lee, Hubbard, & Min-Sun, 2009; Barnett &
Ceci, 2002). Transfer might be attributable in part to the habituation of one behavior freeing
up self-regulatory resources to work on another behavior (Fleig et al., 2011). The
consistently smaller odds ratios in the usual care comparison groups, however, indicate that
successfully adopting one behavior does not have the same effect as adopting a behavior in
the context of receiving tailored behavior change interventions. If increased self-efficacy or
straightforward transfer effects were responsible for the coaction, coaction would not be
consistently higher among treatment group participants: In that case, individuals in the
control groups would demonstrate the same transfer effect. Individualized MBC
interventions tailored to TTM constructs may have a unique potential to create synergistic
effects on behavior change in part because they are teaching participants principles of
behavior change that can be generalized across behaviors (Noar et al., 2008), such as
increasing the awareness of the benefits of changing in Precontemplation, reducing barriers
in Contemplation, and increasing use of stimulus control and counter-conditioning in
Action. It is yet to be determined if other types of MBC interventions (e.g., interventions
guided by other theoretical frameworks) would produce similar levels of coaction.
This study is limited to a review of three studies related to energy balance behaviors.
Additional research is needed to further explore the consistency and magnitude of coaction
in studies targeting additional behaviors and behaviors that are not as clearly linked by a
specific over-arching theme, such as weight management. The potential for coaction among
smoking and other behaviors is of particular interest given that smokers are more likely to
engage in other unhealthy behaviors (Paiva et al., 2012; Chiolero, Wietlisbach, Ruffieux,
Paccaud, & Cornuz, 2006; Fine, Philogene, Gramling, Coups, & Sinha, 2004; Berrigan et
al., 2003).
While in other contexts variability in study designs, target populations, intervention tailoring
and delivery protocols, and target behaviors (weight loss versus obesity prevention) could beJohnson et al. Page 7

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
viewed as a drawback, it is a strength of this study. The consistency and generalizability of
coaction in varying study designs highlights the robustness of this finding. It also
underscores the need to more systematically investigate the circumstances under which
coaction occurs to inform future MBC interventions.
In summary, this study demonstrates that coaction is a reliable phenomenon in the context of
tailored, theoretically driven MBC interventions related to weight management and obesity
prevention. In the interest of cost-effectiveness, ease of dissemination, and maximizing
effectiveness, future research on multiple behavior interventions should examine potential
predictors of coaction; what level and combinations of tailoring will produce the optimal
balance between response burden and outcomes; and whether similar effects can be obtained
when targeting more diverse combinations of behaviors. An increased understanding of how
to maximize coaction to facilitate MBC can inform future intervention development in
several areas. MBC interventions targeting energy balance behaviors are particularly crucial
given that the prevalence of obesity is 35.7% and the combined prevalence of overweight
and obesity is 68.8%. Though the previous dramatic increases in prevalence have leveled off
in recent years, these epidemic rates show no evidence of decline (Flegal, Carroll, Kit, &
Ogden, 2012). Evidence-based MBC interventions that produce coaction could well be one
component of effective treatments to address those all too common conditions.
