Narrative review of models and success
factors for scaling up public health
interventions
Andrew J. Milat1,2*, Adrian Bauman1and Sally Redman3
Abstract
Background: To maximise the impact of public health research, research interventions found to be effective in
improving health need to be scaled up and delivered on a population-wide basis. Theoretical frameworks and
approaches are useful for describing and understanding how effective interventions are scaled up from small trials into
broader policy and practice and can be used as a tool to facilitate effective scale-up. The purpose of this literature
review was to synthesise evidence on scaling up public health interventions into population-wide policy and practice,
with a focus on the defining and describing frameworks, processes and methods of scaling up public health initiatives.
Methods: The review involved keyword searches of electronic databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EBM
Reviews and Google Scholar between August and December 2013. Keywords included ‘scaling up ’and ‘scalability ’,
while the search terms ‘intervention research ’,‘translational research ’,‘research dissemination ’,‘health promotion ’and
‘public health ’were used to focus the search on public health approaches. Studies included in the review were
published in English from January 1990 to December 2013 and described processes, theories or frameworks associated
with scaling up public health and health promotion interventions.
Results: There is a growing body of literature describing frameworks for scaling health interventions, with the review
identifying eight frameworks, the majority of which have an explicit focus on scaling up health action in low and
middle income country contexts. Key success factors for scaling up included the importance of establishing monitoring
and evaluation systems, costing and economic modelling of intervention approaches, active engagement of a range of
implementers and the target community, tailoring the scaled-up approach to the local context, the use of participatory
approaches, the systematic use of evidence, infrastructure to support implementation, strong leadership and
champions, political will, well defined scale-up strategy and strong advocacy.
Conclusions: Effective scaling up requires the systematic use of evidence, and it is essential that data from
implementation monitoring is linked to decision making throughout the scaling up process. Conceptual frameworks
can assist both policy makers and researchers to determine the type of research that is most useful at different stages
of scaling up processes.
Introduction
The transfer of new knowledge from research into policy
and practice continues to be sub-optimal [1]. A major
r e a s o nf o rs l o wp r o g r e s si sw h a ts o m ec a l lt h e “know-do
gap”—the gap between what is known in research and what
gets implemented [2].Both the failure of effective public health initiatives to
influence public health practice and the lag between evi-
dence generation and implementation represent a consider-
able impediment to population-wide health improvement,
as it denies or delays community access to effective services
[3–5]. Even where there is evidence of the efficacy or effect-
iveness of public health interv entions, there has been much
less attention paid to the mechanisms for delivering them
to scale [6].* Correspondence: andrew.milat@doh.health.nsw.gov.au

Scaling up is the process by which health interventions
shown to be efficacious on a small scale and or under con-
trolled conditions are expanded under real world condi-
tions into broader policy or practice [7]. The concept of
scaling up is different from routine adoption as it involves
an explicit intent to expand the reach of an intervention
to new settings or target groups and is accompanied by
systematic strategy to achieve this objective [8].
The issue of how best to scale up health interventions
has been receiving recent attention, particularly in the
global health literature [7, 9] but there are few studies
that offer frameworks and methods for the effective scale
up of public health interventions [10].
Theoretical frameworks and approaches are useful for
describing and understanding how effective interven-
tions are scaled up from small trials into broader policy
and practice and can be important support tools for pol-
icy makers and practitioners in their efforts to scale up
public health interventions. Such evidence-to-practice
frameworks are gaining greater prominence in public
health and health care [7].
The purpose of this literature review was to synthesise
evidence on scaling up public health interventions into
population-wide policy and practice, with a focus on
defining and describing the processes and frameworks
that support the scale up of public health initiatives.
The review also aimed to identify key success factors
and barriers to effective scale up of public health
interventions.
Methods
Literature review search strategy
The review included publications with a focus on con-
cepts, theories and models for scaling up of public
health interventions. For the purposes of this review, an
intervention was defined as a set of actions with a coher-
ent objective to bring about change or produce identifi-
able outcomes [10]. These actions may include policy,
regulatory initiatives, single strategy projects or multi-
component programmes. Public health interventions are
intended to promote or protect health or prevent ill health
in communities or populations, and they are distinguished
from clinical interventions, which are intended to prevent
or treat illness in individuals [10]. Table 1 details the rele-
vant study descriptions, search terms and databases cov-
ered in the review.
The review was conducted in two phases between
August and December 2013. In phase 1, abstracts
were retrieved and assessed against the review cri-
teria. For abstracts that met the review criteria in
phase 1, full papers were retrieved and were assessed
against the review criteria. Studies included in the re-
view met the following criteria:–Published in English from January 1990 to
December 2013
–Described processes, theories or models/frameworks
associated with scaling up public health and health
promotion interventions
–Were theoretical and opinion pieces, case studies,
descriptive studies or intervention studies
For the purpose of this review, ‘concepts ’were de-
fined as scientific methods that provide information
that informs the scale up of interventions such as
epidemiological forecasting, economic methods etc.
‘Theories ’were defined as ideas that explain scale up
and offer principles upon which scale up can be
based. Finally, ‘frameworks/models ’propose a struc-
ture around which scale-up can be organised. Frame-
works/models are used to inform decisions and
judgments about scaling up and often apply multiple
concepts, processes and theories.
Studies focusing on the scaling up of health services
and public health or health promotion programmes
were included in the review, while studies with a sole
focus on health services were excluded. In this review,
‘health services ’referred to the provision of clinical care
in hospital and community settings. The reference lists
of the full papers were also checked, and relevant pa-
pers were included in the final review. The search
process is summarised in Fig. 1.
The full papers were also reviewed and thematically
analysed [11] to determine key success factors and bar-
riers to scale-up. The papers were reviewed and a code
frame developed by the lead author in discussion with
co-authors. The lead author then recorded the fre-
quency of mentions of success factors and barriers.Table 1 Study designs, review search terms and databases used

Findings of the literature review
Search results
An initial review of abstracts in electronic databases
against the inclusion criteria yielded 100 abstracts, and
searches of the grey literature further identified four
documents. Of the 104 papers and documents reviewed
against the inclusion criteria, 29 papers recommended
effective interventions for scaling up, but did notexamine concepts, theories and models in any great
detail (so were excluded), 11 papers provided accounts
of scaling up processes of public health interventions
and 25 papers described concepts, theories and models
relevant to scaling up public health interventions. The
majority of papers excluded from phase 1 of the review
(n= 41) focused on health service interventions,
particularly expanding anti-retroviral treatment for HIV
in low income countries.Fig. 1 Literature search process and numbers of papers identified, excluded and included in the review of increasing the scale of public
health interventionsMilat et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:113 Page 3 of 11
In phase 2 of the review, a total of 38 full papers and
reports were retrieved and reviewed against the inclu-
sion criteria ( n= 38), with 11 papers providing ac-
counts of scaling up processes of public health
interventions. Twenty-five papers and reports de-
scribed concepts, theories and models relevant to scal-
ing up public health interventions, of which 24 were
included in the final review.
Additional file 1: Table S1 summarises characteristics of
papers and reports focusing on concepts, theories and
models relevant to scaling up public health interventions
including reference details, study type, concepts, theories
used or proposed, key concepts, elements of the model or
framework, context and success factors and important
findings. A number of studies were both case studies and
proposed theoretical frameworks for scaling up public
health interventions and were described as such in the
‘study type ’column of Additional file 1: Table S1.
Study characteristics
The literature on processes, theories or frameworks as-
sociated with scaling up public health and health pro-
motion interventions is growing rapidly, with 21 of the
24 (88 %) publications in this review published since
2006, highlighting that this is a new field of public
health enquiry. Research in this field continues to be
characterised by great variat ion in definitions, processes
and models. Studies in this review could be grouped
under three broad themes: ec onomic and mathematical
models and methods [12 –15]; scaling up theories and
principles [16 –22]; and scaling up frameworks (both
generic and issue specific) [7, 9, 23 –28].
Defining scaling up and scalability
Mangham and Hanson [18] suggest that scaling up is
used primarily to describe the ambition or process of
expanding the coverage of health interventions, but can
also refer to increasing the financial, human and capital
resources required to expand coverage. WHO and
E x p a n d N e td e f i n es c a l i n gu pa s ‘…deliberate efforts to
increase the impact of successfully tested health innova-
tions so as to benefit more people and to foster policy
and program development on a lasting basis ’[see p. 2 in
7]. The term ‘scaling up ’has been applied in the litera-
ture in several distinct ways including to describe the
following: the dissemination of a new technique, a
prototype product, or proces s innovation [16, 17, 21, 27,
29], epidemiological and economic forecasting; [13 –15,
30, 31] ‘growing ’an organisational or system capacity to
implement to a new level [29, 32 –34]; and translating a
small-scale initiative into a government policy [35 –37].
The papers included in this review offered only one def-
inition of the term ‘scalability ’, which was developed by the
authors of this manuscript in 2011 using an expert Delphiprocess with Australian policy makers and researchers as
follows: [25, 26, 35] ‘…the ability of a health intervention
shown to be efficacious on a small scale and or under
controlled conditions to be expanded under real world
conditions to reach a greater proportion of the eligible
population, while retaining effectiveness ’[25].
Frameworks for scaling up public health interventions
The review identified eight frameworks [7, 9, 23 –28]
(see Table 2), the majority of which had an explicit focus
on scaling up health action in low- and middle-income
countries, indicating a gap in scaling up methods in
high-income country contexts. Of these, three frame-
works focused on scaling up specific health interven-
tions [23, 27, 28] (i.e. insecticide-treated nets for
malaria, promoting breastfeeding and maternal nutri-
tion programmes), while five propose generic frame-
works that can be applied to efforts to scale up a range
of public health endeavours [7, 9, 24 –26]. Generic
frameworks will be examined more closely as they have
the greatest potential to guide public health action
across many areas.
The oldest of these generic frameworks, the scaling up
management (SUM) framework, was developed by Kohl
and colleagues in 2003, and was updated in 2012 [24, 38].
It proposes three key steps with a series of tasks under
each step. The first step involves developing a scaling up
plan and creating a vision of what scaling up will look like
if successfully implemented. Step 2 involves establishing
the preconditions for scaling up, with key tasks including
building the legitimacy of the intervention and the pro-
posed approach, constituency building and realigning and
mobilising resources. In the final step, the scaling up
process is implemented based on the identification of
factors that can promote extension and sustainability. Key
tasks involve modifying organisational structures, coordin-
ating action and performance monitoring.
The WHO and ExpandNet (2010) [7] model developed
by Simmons, Ghiron, Fajans and Newton based on earlier
work by Simmons and Shiffman (2007) [39] offers a slightly
different way of systematically thinking about scaling up
and was developed in light of the literature and expert
opinion. The conceptual model accompanying the frame-
work consists of five elements, with the scaling-up strategy
as the centrepiece and five strategic choice areas (dissem-
ination and advocacy; organisational process; cost and
resource mobilisation; monitoring and evaluation). The
framework is guided by four key principles which are
systems thinking; a focus on sustainability; the need to
determine scalability; and respect for gender, equity and
human rights principles.
The framework proposes nine steps for developing a
scaling-up strategy that involve the following: i) planning
actions to increase the scalability of the innovation; ii)Milat et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:113 Page 4 of 11

Yamey (2011) [9] offers a framework and key success
factors for scaling up global health initiatives based on a
literature review and interviews with ‘thought leaders ’.
Yamey ’s framework divides the scaling up process intosix categories: attributes of the specific tool or service being
scaled up; attributes of the im plementers; the chosen deliv-
ery strategy; attributes of the ‘adopting ’community; the
socio-political context; and the research context.
Each of Yamey ’s categories will now be examined in
greater detail, starting with the attributes of the specific tool
or service being scaled up. Keeping the intervention simple
is considered a predictor of success [40, 41], and technical
experts who have managed large-scale implementation also
argue that getting the impleme ntation policies and proce-
dures scientifically robust an d evidence informed before
going to scale is crucial for success [42].
Addressing the attributes of the implementers, the
framework suggests that strong leadership and governance
play an important role in successful scale up as is getting
buy-in from local implementers and other key stake-
holders. The framework also recommends using both
state and non-state actors as implementers.Table 2 Synthesis of public health scaling up models and frameworks (Continued)

The framework suggests successful multiple

The chosen delivery strategy is also of great import-
ance, with the framework recommending the applica-
tion of diffusion of innovation theory by focusing on the
five factors identified by Rogers (1995) [43] as being posi-
tively associated with the faster diffusion of an innovation.
The framework also describes cascade and phased ap-
proaches to scaling up depending on the context within
which an intervention is delivered. Cascade approaches
use a ‘train the trainer ’approach that can result in rapid
expansion of interventions. Going to scale in a phased
manner begins with a pilot programme, followed by step-
wise expansion and learning lessons along the way to help
refine further expansion. Tailoring scale-up to the local
situation and decentralising delivery by adopting an inte-
grated approach to scale-up is also considered important.
Thinking about the attributes of the adopting commu-
nity can be facilitated through the active participation
of the community in planning, implementing, and mon-
itoring interventions and i s cited as a crucial factor in
successful scale-up. Being cognisant of the socio-
political context is a vital consideration in the frame-
work, particularly building political good will and align-
ment with national policies. Finally, the framework
requires due consideration of the research context. This
can be done by incorporating research into implementa-
tion using ‘learning and doing ’approaches that involve
the systematic application of evidence to guide the
process and incorporate new learning.
Milat and colleagues developed a model of ‘scalability
considerations ’using a literature review and expert Delphi
process in 2012 [25], which was further developed in 2013
into the ‘increasing the scale of population health interven-
tions guide ’[26] for the NSW Ministry of Health in
Australia. The framework proposes a four-step process for
scaling up interventions. It differs from other models
discussed as it is specifically designed for scale-up of pub-
lic health interventions in high income countries and is
unique in that step 1 involves a ‘scalability assessment ’that
determines the suitability of the intervention/s by asses-
sing effectiveness, potential reach and adoption, alignment
with the strategic context and intervention acceptability
and feasibility. The outcome of this assessment will deter-
mine whether the remaining steps in the guide should be
followed.
Step 2 describes how to develop a scaling up plan
which should create a vision of what scaling up will look
like and a compelling case for action. This step involves
documenting a rationale for scaling up, describing the
intervention, completing a situational and stakeholder
analysis, determining who could be involved in scale up
and what their role will be, selecting an approach to
scaling up, considering options for evaluation and moni-
toring and estimating resources required for scale up
and writing up the plan.Step 3 describes how to prepare for scaling up by secur-
ing resources and building a foundation of legitimacy and
support for the scaling up plan process. This step involves
consultation with stakeholders, legitimising change, build-
ing a broad constituency and realigning and mobilising
resources. Finally, step 4 describes the main tasks that
should be addressed during scaling up including modify-
ing and strengthening organisations, coordinating action
and governance, monitoring performance, quality and
efficiency and ensuring sustainability.
Though many of these frameworks propose linear pro-
cesses for scaling health interventions, it is acknowledged
by their authors that the reality of ‘real world ’scale-up is
that one or more steps in scale up are often missed. For
example, using the Milat et al. 2014 model as an example,
initiatives often go from a scalability assessment (step 1)
to full implementation (step 4), without establishing im-
portant preconditions for success such as building a broad
constituency and realigning and mobilising resources [8,
19, 26].
A common characteristic of scaling up models identified
in this review is that they link many existing concepts in
the literature and interpret them together and in relation to
one another to illuminate factors that inform large-scale
implementation of public health interventions. Common
characteristics of these models include a focus on under-
standing the attributes of the intervention being scaled up
(effectiveness, potential reach, acceptability etc.), identifying
and supporting implementers, the selection of an appropri-
ate delivery strategy, understanding and accommodating
the characteristics of the adopting community, taking into
account the broader socio-political context, and the use of
research, evaluation and monitoring data to inform the
scale-up process. Importantl y ,t h e s ef r a m e w o r k se n a b l ea

cepts and methods associated with the scale-up of public
health interventions.
Success factors and barriers to effectively scaling up public
health interventions
Key success factors for scaling up health interventions
gleaned from this review, particularly from case studies and
papers that interviewed implementation experts in order of
frequency of mention in the literature are the following: es-
tablishing monitoring and evaluation systems [5, 7, 11, 13,
17, 20, 25 –27, 29 –31, 44]; costing and economic and other
modelling of intervention approaches [10, 12, 13, 16 –18,
20, 23, 24, 28, 32, 44]; active engagement of a range of
implementers and the target community [7, 9, 13, 17, 20,
25–27, 29, 31, 44]; tailoring the scale-up approach to the
local context and use of partici patory approaches [5, 7, 13,
17, 26, 29, 41, 44]; systematic use of evidence [7, 9, 13, 17,
26, 31, 44]; infrastructure to support implementation such
as training, delivery systems, technical resources [13, 17, 20,Milat et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:113 Page 7 of 11
27, 31, 32, 44], strong leadership and champions [7, 9, 13,
17, 25, 44]; political will [7, 9, 17, 25, 32]; well defined scale
up strategy [9, 13, 24, 27, 44]; and strong advocacy [7, 9, 12,
22, 27] (See Table 3).
There is merit in more closely examining some of these
success factors starting with the importance of the use ofevidence. It was widely noted in papers that effective
scale-up requires the systematic use of different types of
evidence. For example, Simmons and Shiffman [39] argue
that successful scale-up ‘…requires the systematic use of
evidence to guide the process and incorporate new learn-
ing.’It was also noted that quality control and performance

considerations were considered fundamental to making
effective decisions about the appropriateness and feasibility
of population-level programme implementation. Failure to
address economic outcomes was often noted as a barrier to
scale-up and the presence of this data was conversely consid-
ered an important facilitator of effective decision making.
Consideration of the context within which interven-
tions are delivered was widely identified as an important
success factor. Tailoring the scale-up approach to the
settings within which the y operate such as community
characteristics, financial and human resources and local
socio-political landscape was thought to be facilitated
by the use of participatory approaches that include ac-
tive engagement of a range of implementers and the
target community.
Barriers to successful scale-up of public health interven-
tions identified in the review were often the converse of the
success factors and ranged from the following: not adapting
intervention approaches to the local context [18 –20, 24],
intervention costs and other economic factors [12, 22, 25,
32], lack of human resources [13, 18, 19], resistance to the
introduction of new practices due to capacity constraints
[18, 19, 26], insufficient investment in implementation
infrastructure including train ing, monitoring and evaluation
systems [17, 18, 45], staff recruitment and staff turnover
[18, 19, 46] and lack of political will [9, 32].
There were a number of challenges identified in the
literature to moving interventions from a ‘research ’phase
to a widespread adoption or scaling up phase in high-
income countries. Norton and Mittman ’s [19] examination
of barriers and enablers to scaling up ten promising health
promotion and disease prevention interventions in the
USA found that many of the organisations implementing
the programmes during initial research phases viewed the
programmes as experimental and time-limited, and were
reluctant to have interventions become fully integrated
into the organisation ’s routine service delivery after the
study. They also found that a number of research teams
were subsequently unable to implement the programme
according to original experimental protocol in real world
settings using community-based organisations (e.g. senior
centres), and had to adapt the interventions to fit typical
organisations with limited resources.
Discussion
While the scale of an intervention may seem an obvious
concept, the findings of this review confirm that the terms
scaling up and scalability have been applied in different
ways and contexts with little c onsistency. Though scalabil-
ity is a less frequently used term in the context of publichealth [25, 35], it appears to have a similar intent to that of
scaling up. Clarifying the m eaning and relationships
between new and emerging terminology is an important
endeavour as it facilitates precise communication amongst
those working and researching an i nterdisciplinary field like
public health [47].
There is a growing body of literature describing frame-
works for scaling health int erventions, with the review
identifying seven frameworks [7, 9, 23, 24, 26 –28], the ma-
jority of which have an explicit focus on scaling up health
action in low- and middle-income country contexts. While
the majority of these frameworks were specifically devel-
oped for scaling up in low- and middle-income countries,
they are generally applicable to scaling up public health
action in high-income contex ts as they have a similar focus
on improving health status through action directed toward
the health of an entire population, or sub-population, rather
than individuals. However, population action in high-
income countries is characterised by fewer resource and
capacity constraints than in global health contexts. In
addition, policy makers in high-income countries can bring
greater technical and system capacity to bear on public
health problems and as such models for scaling up public
health action in these contexts should keep this in mind.
The review identified a number of key success factors in
efforts to scale up health interventions including strong
leadership and governance [9, 28, 29, 32, 37], active
engagement of a range of implementers and of the target
community [9, 19, 27, 29] and tailoring the scale-up
approach to the local context [7, 9, 45].
Costs and economic modelling of scaling up interven-
tions were widely considered fundamental to strategic
decisions about public health programme implementation
at various stages of scale up [12, 13, 22, 25, 30]. Costing of
an intervention identifies whether the various arms of a
programme are receiving money as was intended in the
original plan and underpins any subsequent economic
evaluation [48]. Despite its value, this information is
generally absent from research reports and in particular
published intervention studies [25, 49]. Given the import-
ance of economic data to informing scaling up processes
[25], the field should be encouraged to collect and publish
data on intervention costs and where feasible cost effect-
iveness of interventions.
The notion of keeping the intervention simple as a
success factor merits further consideration in light of the
complexity of many population health interventions.
Complex population health interventions can be multi-
level and multi-component in nature and by virtue of
this are not simple. However, the literature suggests that
though the overall strategy may be complex, individual
intervention components that are easy to understand
and adopt by key stakeholders and target audiences are
more readily scaled up.Milat et al. Implementation Science  (2015) 10:113 Page 9 of 11
Finally, the importance of research, evaluation and moni-
toring systems to effective scale-up was widely noted as an
important success factor [7, 9, 17, 19, 22, 24, 27, 29]. The
systematic use of evidence and data from implementation
monitoring that is linked to decision making throughout
the scaling up process can be of great assistance in scaling
processes. It is important that these evaluative and monitor-
ing frameworks are built into intervention delivery from
the outset and produce reliable and timely information to
inform scaling up decision making [7, 9, 24, 25].
It is also worth noting that three of the generic scaling
up frameworks (scaling up management framework and
ExpandNet; increasing the scale of population health
intervention guide) were identified in the grey literature
and were not published in the peer reviewed literature.
This highlights the importance of publishing future
frameworks in the peer reviewed literature to increase
their dissemination to the field.
Giving close consideration barriers and enablers to
scaling up interventions in developed country contexts,
Norton and Mittman ’s [19] examination of the scale up
promising health promotion and disease prevention in-
t e r v e n t i o n si nt h eU S As u g g e s t st h a ti n t e r v e n t i o n s
should be tested in more typical resource-constrained
community-based settings before broader roll out. This
view is supported by Glasgow and Emmons [50] and
Rychetnik and colleagues [51] who argue that more
funding and reporting of practical trials that address
external validity and contextual issues will significantly
enhance translation into practice.
A limitation of this review was that it did not examine
efforts to expand the reach and impact of public health
policies and programmes, where studies did not use the
terms scaling up and scalability to describe such efforts. This
was done to impose some degree of specificity of concepts
that might otherwise prove too diffuse for identification in
the literature and subsequent analysis. However, there is
merit in future reviews of the scaling up literature including
search terms such as ‘spread ’and‘diffusion of innovation ’in
order to capture the greatest number of relevant studies.
Key success factors and barriers for scaling up health inter-
ventions gleaned from this review are listed in order of the
frequency of mentions in reviewed papers. These factors
were identified using thematic analysis, a method for identi-
fying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes) within data.
As the reviewed papers offered empirical observations ra-
ther than evidence of causality, caution should be exercised
when interpreting the success factors and barriers .
Another methodological limitation is that we did not
estimate the level of publication bias and selective publica-
tion in this emerging field. Finally, our analysis included
studies published up to December 2013 and we may not
have captured emerging approaches to scaling up health
interventions.Conclusion
Theoretical frameworks and approaches are useful for
describing and understanding how effective interventions
are scaled up from small trials into broader policy and
practice. There is a growing body of literature describing
frameworks for scaling health interventions, most of
which have an explicit focus on scaling up health action in
low- and middle-income country contexts. Effective scal-
ing up processes requires the systematic use of evidence,
and it is essential that data from implementation monitor-
ing is linked to decision making throughout the scaling up
process. Conceptual frameworks reviewed can assist both
policy makers and researchers in determining the types of
research that are most useful at various stages of a scaling
up process.
