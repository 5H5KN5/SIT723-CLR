Abstract
Background: Conduct disorder (CD) is a complex mental disorder characterized by severe rule-breaking and
aggressive behavior. While studies have shown that several therapeutic interventions are effective in treating CD
symptoms, researchers call for treatments based on etiological knowledge and potential patho-mechanisms.
Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) may represent such a treatment approach: Studies have shown that
individuals with CD show mentalizing deficits and that mentalizing might represent a protective factor against the
development of the disorder. As MBT focuses on the understanding of social behavior in terms of mental states,
fostering mentalizing might help CD individuals to (re)gain an adaptive way of coping with negative emotions
especially in social interactions and thus reduce aggressive behavior. For this purpose, MBT was adapted for
adolescents with CD (MBT-CD). This is a protocol of a feasibility and pilot study to inform the planning of a
prospective RCT. The primary aim is to estimate the feasibility of an RCT based on the acceptability of the
intervention and the scientific assessments by CD individuals and their families indicated by quantitative and
qualitative data, as well as based on necessary organizational resources to conduct an RCT. The secondary aim is to
investigate the course of symptom severity and mentalizing skills.
Methods: The bi-center study is carried out in two outpatient settings associated with university hospitals
(Heidelberg and Mainz) in Germany. Adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years with a CD or oppositional defiant
disorder (ODD) diagnosis are included. Participants receive MBT-CD for 6 to 12 months. The primary outcome of
the feasibility study (e.g., recruitment and adherence rates) will be descriptively analyzed. Multilevel modeling will
be used to investigate secondary outcome data.
Discussion: Fostering the capacity to mentalize social interactions triggering non-mentalized, aggressive behavior
might help CD individuals to behave more adaptively. The feasibility trial is essential for gathering information on
how to properly conduct MBT-CD including appropriate scientific assessments in this patient group, in order to
subsequently investigate the effectiveness of MBT-CD in an RCT.

Background and rationale
Conduct disorder (CD) is a severe and complex mental
disorder most common in adolescence. It is defined as a
“repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which
the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate soci-
etal norms or rules are violated ”[1]. Epidemiological
studies have shown that about 5-10% of all children and
adolescents meet the criteria for CD, while boys are
more likely to be diagnosed than girls [ 2]. CD is a ser-
ious risk factor for the development of antisocial person-
ality disorder (ASPD). More than 50% of men with
ASPD fulfilled criteria for CD prior to the age of 15 [ 3].
Moreover, CD is often comorbid with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder [ 4] and is associated with an in-
creased risk for the development of a number of other
mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, depres-
sion, substance use disorder, and bipolar disorder [ 5].
The following environmental factors have been identi-
fied to be associated with an increased risk for the
development of CD [ 6]: dysfunctional parent-child inter-
actions, critical life events such as parental divorce,parental loss, as well as early neglect, physical and sexual
abuse [ 6–8]. The accumulation of risk factors further in-
creases the risk for the development of CD [ 9]. At the
same time, protective factors like intelligence or social
support can help reduce the risk for dysfunctional devel-
opment [ 10]. Based on these findings, there is consensus
that the emergence of CD is complex [ 11], yet still, very
little is known about the mechanisms contributing to
the development and maintenance of CD subsequent to
the exposure to the identified risk factors.
So far, meta-analyses have shown that a number of in-
terventions are effective in reducing CD symptoms [ 12,
13]. Among these, cognitive-behavioral therapy, social
skills training, parent training, and multi-systemic ther-
apy are regarded as evidence-based treatments [ 12,14].
They differ in their involvement of parents or peers, but
their focus on CD symptom management is common to
all. However, effect sizes are small, conduct problems
oftentimes persist and it remains unclear which treat-
ment works best for whom and why [ 12]. Moreover,
drop-out rates of around 20% [ 12] and low motivationTaubner et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:139 Page 2 of 10
to seek treatment in the first place render the effective
and sustainable treatment of CD pathology difficult. Im-
portantly, interventions are so far lacking a comprehen-
sive etiological understanding of CD, which may entail
the failing of targeting relevant mechanisms contributing
to the development and maintaining of CD symptoms.
In line with this notion, authors call for specification of
interventions to target specific individual or subgroup
deficits [ 11,12] and base them on knowledge about
underlying patho-mechanisms [ 11].
Recently, it has been shown that CD alongside many
other mental disorders is related to dysfunctions in men-
talizing [ 15]. Mentalizing describes an individual ’s im-
aginative ability to perceive one ’s own and other ’s
behavior as the product of affective and cognitive mental
states [ 16]. Taubner and colleagues [ 17] showed that ad-
olescents with CD have a significantly lower mentalizing
capacity compared to adolescents with no CD. These
findings were replicated in a later study by Cropp et al.
[18]. Moreover, focusing more on a developmental
perspective fostering insight into possible patho-
mechanisms, studies showed that mentalizing mediates
the relationship between childhood maltreatment and
externalizing problems: Taubner and colleagues [ 19,20]
found that mentalizing (partially) mediated the relation-
ship between childhood maltreatment and potential for
violent behavior in adolescence (14-21 years, [ 19]; 15-18
years, [ 20]). Similarly, Ensink and colleagues [ 21] found
that mentalizing partially mediated the link between
childhood sexual abuse and externalizing problems, such
as rule-breaking and aggressive behavior, in children
aged between 7 and 12. Moreover, investigating adoles-
cent PTSD patients, Abate and colleagues [ 22] found
that hyper mentalizing mediated the link between
trauma and aggression in female PTSD inpatients. Taken
together, results indicate that mentalizing may serve as a
protective factor against externalizing behaviors while
dysfunctional mentalizing may not only be part of CD
pathology but also etiology.
The relation between limited (inhibited or biased)
mentalizing and aggressive behavior in CD may be ex-
plained by different phenomena: Firstly, if mentalizing is
inhibited, the “violence inhibition mechanism ”as de-
scribed by Blair [ 23] might be impaired: According to
the author, violent behavior is normally inhibited when
we see and empathize with others ’distress. If however
mentalizing is inhibited, and consequently, individuals
have difficulties to recognize others ’distress, the thresh-
old for aggression and violent behavior might be low-
ered. Secondly, if mentalizing is negatively biased,
aggressive behavior may be elicited due to a more hostile
“social information processing ”[24–26] in these adoles-
cents, characterized by a tendency to attribute hostile in-
tent upon neutral or even positive social signals. As wecan train and change the capacity to mentalize, a treat-
ment focusing on enhancing mentalizing might thus be
able to target a relevant patho-mechanism of CD.
In sum, we assume that a psychological intervention
with a focus on improving mentalizing in the adolescent
and his/her family can improve CD pathology as effect-
ive or even more sustainably than interventions focusing
on symptom management only.
For this purpose, the authors have developed
mentalization-based treatment (MBT) for CD (MBT-
CD). MBT-CD is a further development of MBT, which
is evidence-based for patients with borderline personality
disorder. MBT has already been adjusted successfully to
working with adolescents with self-harm [ 27]. MBT-CD
focuses on the development of a basic understanding of
interpersonal situations and emotions, and specific men-
talizing deficits that trigger antisocial and aggressive be-
havior. In order to make this new treatment available for
the adolescent population, we need to determine its ef-
fectiveness by conducting a randomized controlled trial
(RCT). In line with the SPIRIT ([ 28], for an overview of
included items please see Additional file 1) and Consoli-
dated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) state-
ment [ 29], this protocol of a feasibility study is aimed at
enhancing transparency and quality in gathering infor-
mation to develop and appropriately conduct the proto-
col of a future RCT.
Methods/design
Aims
The primary aim of the feasibility and pilot study is to
estimate the feasibility of an RCT on MBT-CD based on
acceptability of the intervention (indicated by recruit-
ment rates into treatment, drop-out rates and completer
rates, and adolescents ’oral evaluation), acceptability of
the scientific assessments by the patients and family (in-
dicated by adherence rates to the scientific assessments,
and adolescents ’oral evaluation), and organizational re-
sources needed to conduct an RCT in an outpatient only
and a combined outpatient and inpatient setting in the
future. The secondary aim is the examination of CD-
symptom severity over time, the course of aggressive
and antisocial behavior, and changes in mentalizing. The
primary aim of the future RCT will be to determine the
effectiveness of MBT-CD in terms of CD symptom se-
verity, levels of aggression, and antisocial behavior as
well as an appropriate comparison group. The secondary
aim of the RCT will be to investigate the change in a
proposed patho-mechanism (i.e., mentalizing) and gen-
eral symptom severity through MBT-CD.
Design
The study is a feasibility and pilot trial to form the basis
for a future, prospective RCT. The study is carried outTaubner et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:139 Page 3 of 10
at two treatment centers in Heidelberg (Institute for
Psychosocial Prevention) and Mainz (Pediatric and Ado-
lescent Psychiatry Mainz), Germany. Adolescent partici-
pants receive MBT-CD over the course of 6 to 12
months. Adolescents and their parents are asked to take
part in study assessments every 3 months during treat-
ment and 3 months after the end of treatment (for an
overview of study flow see Fig. 1). The design is adaptive
in that both, intervention and scientific assessments can
be changed in the course of the study, if, e.g., drop-out
rates and reasons indicate necessary adjustments for suc-
cessful study continuation. Originally, this feasibility trial
was designed as a single-blinded RCT to test the effect-
iveness of MBT-CD compared to treatment as usual
(TAU) delivered as an outpatient treatment at the Clinic
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University-
Hospital Heidelberg. This comparison group was chosen
as it is in line with the routine health care treatment for
adolescents with CD [ 30]. Due to recruitment problems
identified in yearly interim recruitment analyses, the de-
sign was changed into a non-randomized single group
feasibility and pilot trial. This decision was made in con-
sensus with the study funders (Dietmar-Hopp-founda-
tion and Heidehof foundation) upon fulfilling the studytermination criterion of recruiting less than 20% of the a
priori estimated overall sample size of 102 adolescents
within 1 year (to detect a medium effect and considering
25% drop-out).
Primary outcomes
The feasibility of a prospective RCT on MBT-CD will be
estimated based on the acceptability of the intervention
and scientific assessments by the participating adoles-
cents as well as the estimated organizational resources
needed.
Acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated
based on quantitative and qualitative data:
1. Recruitment rates, and consent rates
2. Completion rates
3. Drop-out rates and reasons
4. Treatment duration in months and number of
sessions
5. Oral evaluation of the intervention by the patients
assessed via standardized questions
Acceptability of the scientific assessments will be eval-
uated based on quantitative and qualitative data:

Participants
Adolescents with CD or ODD according to the Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)
[1] aged between 11 and 18 years are included in the
study. Participants are recruited at the participating cen-
ters as well as with leaflets (two separate versions for ad-
olescents and parents), which are distributed through
multipliers and institutions (e.g., child and youth welfare
services, schools, police stations, probation officers). Pro-
spective participants or caretakers can contact the treat-
ment centers via phone (number provided on the leaflet)
to indicate their interest, ask questions, and be screened
for eligibility criteria through a standardized checklistTaubner et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:139 Page 5 of 10
assessing rule-breaking and defiant behavior. Partici-
pants receive a total of 50 €for taking part in the scien-
tific assessments.
Eligibility criteria
Adolescents are included if their main diagnosis is CD
or ODD. The latter is a precursor or milder form of CD,
with a pattern of angry, irritable mood, argumentative/
defiant behavior, or vindictiveness [ 1]. The pattern needs
to last over the course of at least 6 months and needs to
be exhibited in interaction with at least one individual,
who is not a sibling. Moreover, the pattern needs to be
associated with distress in social contexts or negative
consequences for important areas of functioning [ 33].
Adolescents with CD or ODD are only included if they
are between 11 and 18 years of age and both, adoles-
cents and their parents provide written informed con-
sent (forms based on templates of the European General
Data Protection Regulation, GDPR [ 51];). Adolescents
are excluded if they have committed sexual offenses,
show acute psychotic symptoms, suffer from early or
early-onset schizophrenia, have neurological impair-
ments or intelligence severely below average (IQ < 60)
as measured with the Culture Fair Intelligence Test
(CFT) [ 52], are non-German-speaking or have other
clinical contraindication for outpatient psychotherapy
(e.g., acute suicidality).
Concomitant therapies or interventions including hos-
pital stays are permitted, but will be assessed via the
CSSRI-EU [ 50] and reported with the study results.
Intervention
MBT-CD is a CD-specific adaptation of MBT [ 53]. The
primary goal of MBT-CD is the recovery of the menta-
lizing capacity in close relationships and along with this,
a reduction of symptoms, especially aggressive and anti-
social behavior. The treatment duration is 6 to 12
months and consists of up to 30 weekly individual ses-
sions with the adolescent and up to 10 monthly family
sessions. At the beginning of the individual sessions, the
adolescent ’s mentalizing capacity will be diagnosed
(diagnostic phase). Before the 30 individual and 10 fam-
ily sessions, adolescents and their families attend two
psycho-educational workshops. After the end of treat-
ment, 3 booster sessions follow. When indicated, youth
welfare services are involved.
The psycho-educational workshop (MBT-CD Intro-
ductory Workshop, MBT-CD-I) aims to familiarize the
adolescent and their family with the mentalizing con-
cept, educate about CD, the MBT-CD treatment goals,
and to strengthen therapy adherence. MBT-CD-I focuses
on the topics of mentalizing (i.e., what is mentalizing,
failures of mentalizing), emotions (i.e., basic emotions,emotion recognition), attachment and identity, and con-
flicts and boundaries.
After completing MBT-CD-I, adolescents start with
their individual sessions. At the beginning of the individ-
ual sessions, therapy goals are developed using motiv-
ational interviewing and the therapist writes a case
formulation about the adolescent ’s main mentalizing dif-
ficulties, both in collaboration with the adolescent.
Moreover, prior to working on improving mentalizing
abilities, risk behavior is assessed and a risk emergency
plan is developed if necessary. Then, throughout the
main treatment phase, MBT-CD focuses on the thera-
peutic relationship to improve the adolescent ’s mentaliz-
ing. With the therapist holding the adolescent ’s mind in
their mind, non-mentalized emotions (rather than cogni-
tions) and their representations can be explored with re-
gard to core problem behavior. MBT-CD focuses on the
development of a basic understanding of interpersonal
situations, emotions, and failures of mentalizing that
trigger antisocial and aggressive behavior. The monthly
family sessions (MBT-CD-F) aim to create a mentalizing
environment by exploring dysfunctional mentalizing
within the family system [ 54]: With the therapist ’s help,
family members describe non-mentalizing interactions
in detail (noticing and naming), mentalize the interac-
tions (mentalize the moment), formulate potentially dys-
functional family interaction patterns, and consider
possible alternatives (generalize and consider change).
Reciprocal understanding between therapist and all fam-
ily members is continuously monitored (checking). This
way, MBT-CD-F targets problematic family interactions
by practicing mentalizing within relevant interpersonal
context and hence enhancing the family ’s self-regulatory
strategies [ 54]. At the end of therapy, three booster ses-
sions will follow to stabilize treatment effect (see Fig. 2).
Treatment adherence
MBT-CD will be delivered by therapists who have
undergone psychotherapy training, have the legal right
to treat patients under supervision, and who have partic-
ipated in a 4-day MBT-CD training conducted by the
first author (ST). Videos of each session will be obtained.
Supervision will be provided in biweekly sessions. Dur-
ing supervision, case material (including therapy videos)
is reviewed with regard to the therapist ’s understanding
of MBT theory and use of MBT interventions. Per ther-
apist, six videos of one of their MBT-CD therapies will
be randomly chosen to be rated for therapist adherence
and competence with the MBT Adherence and Compe-
tence Scale [ 55].
Statistical analysis
All analyses will be performed according to the intention
to treat principle. Analyses on quantitative data will beTaubner et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:139 Page 6 of 10
conducted using the statistical software SPSS (IBM, Ver-
sion 25). Sociodemographic data and data of the scien-
tific assessments at baseline (T1, see Table 1) will be
used to characterize the sample. Primary outcome vari-
ables (recruitment rates, drop-out rates, and missing
data of adolescents as well as parents) will be descrip-
tively analyzed. The distribution of treatment duration
(in months and number of sessions) will be analyzed to
infer the optimal dose of treatment and necessary flexi-
bility in treatment dose and duration. Scientific
personnel costs will be estimated based on timely effort
(hours needed per month, total number of months). Sec-
ondary outcome variables will be investigated using
multilevel modeling. Content analysis will be used to in-
vestigate qualitative data (drop-out reasons, oral evalua-
tions of MBT-CD, and the scientific assessments). As
additional subgroup analysis, binomial logistic regression
will be conducted modeled after Jorgensen and col-
leagues [ 56], who identified low RF, but not clinical or
sociodemographic variables to predict drop-out of MBT
group treatment in adolescents with borderline personal-
ity disorder. Data entry will be double checked and
range checks for data values will be conducted. Pseudo-
nymized data will be anonymized as soon as possible.
Anonymized data will be stored in Heidelberg according
to the European GDPR [ 51] and deleted 10 years after
study completion.Discussion
This protocol outlines the process of a feasibility and
pilot study on MBT-CD in adolescents with CD or
ODD. So far, treatments focusing mainly on symptom
management remain unsatisfactory in treating patho-
mechanisms possibly contributing to CD. Consequently,
CD symptoms often persist [ 12], leading to unfavorable
long-term prognoses and, together with insufficient un-
derstanding of CD etiology, a pessimism in the treat-
ment of CD [ 57]. Thus, researchers call for improving
CD treatment, e.g., through an integration of knowledge
about the etiology and pathological pathways (e.g., [ 11]).
As dysfunctional mentalizing has been linked to the de-
velopment of CD (cf. [ 18,22,23]), targeting specific
mentalizing deficits in this patient group presents a
promising approach for a more successful and sustain-
able treatment of CD and CD (relapse) prevention. How-
ever, so far, there are no treatments focusing specifically
on mentalizing in adolescents with CD. To fill this gap
and aim at a more long-term positive effect on aggres-
sive, norm-violating, and rule-breaking behavior, the au-
thors have developed MBT for CD. Combining
individual and family sessions, MBT-CD aims at improv-
ing mentalizing in adolescents with CD or ODD and
their families within 6 months to 1 year of treatment. In
line with the CONSORT statement [ 58], we aim at in-
vestigating the feasibility of an RCT in this patient groupFig. 2 The process of MBT-CD in both settingsTaubner et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2021) 7:139 Page 7 of 10
in the first step before conducting an RCT investigating
its effectiveness in a second step. Several characteristics
might render the conduct of an RCT in this patient
group especially difficult: e.g., adolescents with CD
oftentimes do not express a wish for help or display
help-seeking behavior; specific fears may concern losing
credibility in their peer group and portraying themselvesas“weak. ”Moreover, drop-out rates of adolescents with
CD are usually high [ 12], possibly inter alia due to disor-
ganized and avoidant attachment strategies [ 59]. For this
reason, the study design is adaptive, which helps to ad-
dress CD-specific reservations to the intervention or to
the scientific assessments during treatment. Moreover,
the consultation of adolescents ’oral evaluations at the
end of treatment in addition to the analysis of quantita-
tive data will further help to develop and adapt the treat-
ment in close collaboration with the adolescents.
Ultimately, the goal is to provide a treatment, which en-
gages adolescents with CD or ODD and helps fostering
the ability to create and maintain healthy relationships
and understand triggers of one ’s own destructive behav-
ior. As such, MBT-CD is aimed to increase the adoles-
cents ’chances of leading a healthy and satisfying life and
along with this, of economically contributing to society.
