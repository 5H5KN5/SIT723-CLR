Changing the preschool setting to promote 
healthy energy balance-related behaviours 
of preschoolers: a qualitative and quantitative 
process evaluation of the SuperFIT approach

Abstract 
Background: The Early Care and Education (ECE) setting plays an important role in the promotion of a healthy 
lifestyle in young children. SuperFIT is a comprehensive, integrated intervention approach designed to promote 
healthy energy balance-related behaviours in preschoolers. Insight in the process of implementation and the context 
in which SuperFIT was implemented supports the understanding of how the intervention works in practice. This 
process evaluation examined factors that influenced the implementation and maintenance, as well as the (perceived) 
changes in the ECE setting.
Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted. SuperFIT was implemented at twelve preschools in the south 
of the Netherlands. The process evaluation was performed among preschool teachers, managers of the preschool 
organisation, and implementers. Semi-structured in-depth (group) interviews, quantitative process questionnaires, 
the Child-care Food and Activity Practices Questionnaire (CFAPQ) and the Environmental and Policy Assessment and 
Observation (EPAO) were used to evaluate the implementation and maintenance of SuperFIT and the changes in the 
preschool setting. The interviews were analysed using a theoretical framework based on the Implementation Frame -
work of Fleuren and Damschröder’s Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Descriptive analyses were 
performed on the quantitative data.
Results: Various intervention activities were implemented in the preschool setting. Although the intention to main-
tain SuperFIT was present, this was hindered by time constraints and lack of financial resources. Important factors that 
influenced implementation and maintenance were incongruence with current practice, limited perceived capabilities 
to integrate SuperFIT in daily practice, group composition at the preschools, and the perceived top-down imple -
mentation. Organizational vision and societal attention regarding healthy behaviour in general were perceived to be 
supportive for implementation and maintenance. Predominantly, favourable changes were seen in the nutrition- and 
physical activity-related practices of preschool teachers and other aspects of the social preschool environment such 
as the use of play materials. Limited changes were observed in the physical preschool environment.

Contribution to the literature
• Insight in the factors influencing the implementation 
process of health-promoting interventions within the 
ECE setting is important for understanding the success 
of these interventions. Currently, the focus of process 
evaluations is on quantitative implementation con -
cepts.
• The implementation of interventions is influenced by 
the context of the implementation setting. Allowing the 
intervention to be adapted to its context is necessary to 
support the integration of interventions into daily prac -
tice.
• To allow for changes within the ECE setting, interven -
tion implementation should be considered a long-term 
effort.
Background
The Early Care and Education (ECE) setting has been 
recognized as an important setting for promoting healthy 
energy balance-related behaviours (EBRBs) in young 
children [1, 2]. Firstly, supportive nutrition and physical 
activity (PA)-related practices of ECE staff may promote 
healthy EBRBs in children [3, 4]. Secondly, availability 
of (outdoor) play spaces and a variety of play materi -
als may support children’s PA [5–8]. Thirdly, availability 
of healthy food products can support children’s healthy 
dietary intake [9]. Lastly, policies can support activities 
within the ECE setting to promote healthy EBRBs [10, 
11]. Consequently, attending childcare has been related 
to both increased and decreased risks of childhood over -
weight and obesity [12–15].
In recent years, an increasing number of interventions 
in the ECE setting have been developed and evaluated 
(e.g., [16–19]). Review studies of such interventions show 
their potential in changing children’s behaviour, although 
the available evidence is often limited [2, 20–22]. Taking 
a comprehensive approach (i.e., aiming at both nutrition 
and PA, and by involving parents) has been recognised as 
being important for the effectiveness of these interven -
tions [21–23].
SuperFIT (Systems of Underprivileged Preschool -
ers in their home and preschool EnviRonment: Family Intervention Trial) is a comprehensive, integrated inter -
vention approach being applied in the Netherlands [24]. 
SuperFIT aims to improve children’s EBRBs through 
changes in the sociocultural, physical, and political 
environments in both the preschool and home settings. 
An effectiveness study of SuperFIT showed no signifi -
cant differences between the intervention groups and 
control group on BMI z-score, overall PA, and dietary 
intake (Harms LSE, Gubbels JS, Van de Kolk I, Bessems 
KMHH, Vanbelle S, Hahnraths MTH, et  al: The effects 
of SuperFIT, a comprehensive, integrated intervention 
approach, on pre-schoolers dietary intake, submitted) 
[25]. However, preschoolers who participated in the full 
intervention (preschool and family component) showed 
significant positive differences with the control group in 
PA on preschool days and in sweet beverage consump -
tion (Harms LSE, Gubbels JS, Van de Kolk I, Bessems 
KMHH, Vanbelle S, Hahnraths MTH, et  al: The effects 
of SuperFIT, a comprehensive, integrated intervention 
approach, on pre-schoolers dietary intake, submitted) 
[25].
Insight in the processes that influence implementa -
tion may clarify why interventions fail or succeed in 
changing behaviour [26]. Several frameworks explaining 
implementation processes are available [26–28]. The role 
of context has become more important in intervention 
implementation [29, 30]. More emphasis is being put on 
the unique characteristics of the implementation setting, 
for example preschools, and how the setting functions 
as a complex system [30, 31]. Intervention implementa -
tion is given an extra dimension: to what extent was the 
intervention able to interact with the context of the sys -
tem and able to ‘saturate’ the context of this specific set -
ting [30]? A combination of quantitative and qualitative 
research methods is needed to provide insight in both 
determinants for implementation including context [32]. 
High implementation quality is important, as a signifi -
cant decrease in steps/weekday was shown for children in 
kindergartens with low-quality implementation (i.e., low 
dose delivered/received, or satisfaction) of a previous PA-
promoting intervention at childcare, compared to no sig -
nificant change in the control group [16]. Such negative 
intervention effects were not shown with medium- and 
high-quality implementation [16]. Few process evalua -
tions of interventions in the ECE setting are currently Conclusions: Several factors influenced the implementation and maintenance of SuperFIT in the preschool setting. 
Some factors evolved over time from hindering to facilitating, emphasising the importance of allowing sufficient time 
for intervention implementation. SuperFIT changed mainly the social preschool environment.

available, and those that do exist tend to focus on report -
ing quantitative implementation concepts such as dose 
delivered and fidelity [16, 33–36]. However, some stud -
ies also described factors influencing the implementation 
process. Negative factors were, for example, lack of time, 
lack of support from staff, interference with daily sched -
ules, and low parental engagement [33, 36]. Support from 
the intervention provider was identified as a supportive 
factor for implementation [35, 36]. Insight in the factors 
that influenced the implementation process is pivotal. 
This can increase our understanding of what the inter -
vention implementation looked like in practice and may 
shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed 
changes [37]. The current study presents the process 
evaluation of the SuperFIT approach, specifically within 
the preschool (ECE) setting. Several research questions 
will be addressed: 1) How was SuperFIT implemented 
and maintained in the preschool setting and how was 
this received by actors within this setting?; 2) Which fac -
tors influenced implementation and maintenance?; and 
3) What were the (perceived) changes in the preschool 
setting?
Methods
Research design
A mixed-methods design was adopted, using both quali -
tative and quantitative research methods. This process 
evaluation is part of a larger evaluation study, described 
in detail elsewhere [24] and prospectively registered 
(Clini caltr  ials. gov , NCT03021980). The current study 
focussed specifically on the implementation and mainte -
nance processes within the preschool setting. A process 
evaluation of these processes in the home setting is pre -
sented elsewhere [38].
The SuperFIT approach
SuperFIT is a comprehensive, integrated intervention 
approach and a detailed description of its development 
and evaluation has been previously published [24]. Socio-
ecological models and systems theories on behaviour 
were used as theoretical background [39–41]. SuperFIT 
was developed in cooperation with a local PA-provid -
ing organisation, a preschool organisation, and health 
promotion experts in a continuous process of co-crea -
tion and adaptation. The SuperFIT approach consisted 
of three components: a preschool-based component, 
a family-based component, and a community-based 
component.
Intervention strategies in the preschool-based com -
ponent aimed to change the sociocultural, physical, and 
political environments [42]. Strategies to change the 
sociocultural environment focussed on PA and nutri -
tion-related practices of the preschool teachers. Several training sessions addressing PA, nutrition and positive 
child rearing were organised. Each off-the-job train -
ing session was accompanied by coaching on-the-job to 
assist implementation in the workplace. The training ses -
sions and coaching on-the-job were delivered by trained 
health brokers from the local PA-providing organisa -
tion. PA and nutrition cards were developed, containing 
easy-to-perform PA- or nutrition-related activities. To 
change the physical environment, a box with materials 
supporting active play (e.g., hoops, balls, trampoline) and 
nutrition-related materials (e.g., water tap and nutrition-
related story books) was provided. The materials were 
matched to the PA and nutrition cards, ensuring that 
teachers would have the materials needed to perform 
the activities on the cards. In addition, PA- and nutri -
tion-related materials matching specific needs of each 
preschool were provided. A complementary fruit and 
vegetables (F&V) delivery aimed to increase F&V vari -
ety (e.g., cherries, raspberries, beetroot, radish). In order 
to change the political environment, strategies aimed to 
update the nutrition policy (provision of water instead of 
sugar-sweetened drinks and healthy treats) and develop 
a PA policy (including recommendations on time spent 
on active and safe play) were initiated. SuperFIT activities 
started in April 2017 with the first off-the-job training, 
on-the-job coaching, and provision of PA- and nutrition-
related materials. In May 2017, the additional F&V deliv -
ery started. In the fall of 2017, two more training sessions 
and coaching on-the-job were provided. SuperFIT activi -
ties ended in May 2018, with the conclusion of the F&V 
delivery.
SuperFIT also included a family-based component (a 
combination of family sessions and caregiver-only ses -
sions) and a community-based component (development 
and distribution of a social map of PA possibilities) com -
ponent, but these are not the focus of the current paper.
Study setting and participants
SuperFIT was implemented at a convenience sample 
of twelve preschools in low socioeconomic communi -
ties from one preschool organisation in the south of the 
Netherlands [43]. In the Netherlands, preschool consists 
of half-day, formal childcare in which children aged 2-4 
years are prepared for primary school in a playful man -
ner [44]. The process evaluation was performed among 
preschool teachers, management of the preschool 
organisation, and implementers (health brokers from the 
PA-providing organisation). All participants provided 
(verbal) informed consent before participating in the 
study. The Maastricht University Medical Centre, Medi -
cal Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the evalua -
tion study of SuperFIT (METC163022/NL58061.068.16).

Data collection
Data collection consisted of quantitative and qualita -
tive measurements taken between January 2017 and 
November 2018 on several occasions during imple -
mentation and maintenance (see Fig.  1 for the timeline of implementation and evaluation). Following the RE-
AIM framework [45, 46], implementation was opera -
tionalised as delivery of SuperFIT as intended. Factors 
influencing this process were studied. Maintenance 
was operationalised as the extent to which SuperFIT Fig. 1 Timeline of the implementation of the preschool component of SuperFIT and the measurements of the process evaluation. Yellow=

became institutionalised, i.e., part of the routine prac -
tices within the preschools after ending of the imple -
mentation activities [45, 46].
Interviews
Semi-structured in-depth group and individual inter -
views were performed by two researchers. During 
the initial phase of implementation (June/July 2017), 
interviews were conducted with preschool teach -
ers and implementers. These interviews focused on 
development and implementation and served as input 
for the intervention activities that were still to come. 
At the end of the implementation phase (February/
March 2018), in-depth interviews with preschool 
teachers were conducted to evaluate the implementa -
tion process. After the implementation phase (Octo -
ber/November 2018), interviews were conducted 
with preschool teachers, managers of the preschool 
organisation (both general and unit management), and 
implementers to evaluate the maintenance of Super -
FIT. For each round of interviews, topic lists were 
developed. Topics included, for example, strengths 
and weaknesses of SuperFIT, the perceived role of 
the interviewee in nutrition and PA in preschools, 
and perceived changes (full topic lists are provided as 
Supplementary materials). All interviews were held in 
Dutch and audio-recorded.
Questionnaires
The Child-care Food and Activity Practices Ques -
tionnaire (CFAPQ) was used to measure preschool 
teachers’ nutrition- and PA-related practices [47]. 
The CFAPQ was filled in prior to, during and after 
implementation. The CFAPQ was adjusted to fit the 
Dutch preschool setting. Some items were omitted 
because they were not applicable for the preschool set -
ting. In addition, for some items, examples provided 
were adjusted to better fit the preschool setting. An 
item to measure a PA-related practice is, for example, 
‘How often do you play a sport or active game together 
with the children?’. An item to measure the nutrition-
related practices is, for example, ‘I model healthy eat -
ing for the children by eating healthy foods myself’. All 
items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale, rang -
ing from never to always or totally disagree to totally 
agree. Scale reliability was tested using Cronbach’s 
alpha (>0.50 was considered sufficient [48]). Items 
were deleted from the scales to achieve sufficient reli -
ability. Final unreliable scales and deleted items were 
analysed as single items.
Preschool teachers were asked to fill in a quanti -
tative questionnaire regarding the implementation (November/December 2017) and maintenance (May/
June 2018) of SuperFIT. The questionnaire regard -
ing implementation was based on the Client Satisfac -
tion Questionnaire [49] and included a question such 
as ‘Did you find SuperFIT instructive?’. In addition, 
specific questions on each intervention activity were 
asked. Factors influencing maintenance were measured 
using the Measurement Instrument for Determinants 
of Innovations (MIDI), adapted to fit the SuperFIT con -
text [ 50].
Observations
Observations at the preschools were performed using 
an adjusted version of the Environmental and Policy 
Assessment and Observation instrument (EPAO) to 
assess the social and physical preschool environment 
[51]. The parts applicable to the Dutch preschool set -
ting were incorporated (e.g., pre-break indoor play, 
break, and post-break outdoor play). Observations were 
performed on a group level and focused on preschool 
teachers’ behaviour. Observers were guided by questions 
such as ‘Do the preschool staff take part in outdoor play 
activities?’ . In addition, questions related to the imple -
mentation were incorporated to assess the integration 
of SuperFIT within the daily activities of the preschool 
staff. For example, ‘Were fruit and/or vegetables from the 
delivery divided between all children?’ . Observations were 
performed by the same researcher twice during imple -
mentation and once after implementation in nine ran -
domly selected participating preschools, of which one 
preschool had two groups that were both observed. The 
sample of observed preschools remained consistent over 
the three measurements. Items reflecting non-supportive 
preschool staff behaviour were recoded and sum scores 
reflecting a supportive social environment for various 
activities (e.g., outdoor play, indoor play and snack time) 
were calculated.
In order to assess the physical preschool environ -
ment, separate observations were performed by a trained 
researcher using the EPAO [51]. Observations assessed, 
for example, indoor and outdoor play space, availability 
of fixed and portable play materials (indoors and out -
doors), and the presence of screens. The observations of 
the physical environment were performed once prior to 
implementation, once during, and once after implemen -
tation. Where appropriate, sum scores were calculated to 
aggregate different questions into a summary variable, for 
example, total score of available portable play materials.

Analyses
Qualitative data
All interviews were transcribed verbatim and 
anonymised. A second researcher was consulted when 
words or phrases were unclear. To develop the coding 
tree, two researchers independently analysed 19% (6 of 
32) of the interviews and held several consensus meet -
ings. The Implementation Framework of Fleuren et  al. 
[28] formed the basis for the coding tree. This frame -
work was supplemented with the Consolidated Frame -
work For Implementation Research (CFIR) to better 
reflect contextual factors influencing implementation 
and maintenance [27]. The main categories ‘characteris -
tics of the intervention’ and ‘characteristics of the user’ 
from Fleuren et al. [28] were combined with the context-
related factors in ‘the inner and outer setting’ from Dam -
schröder et al. [27] (Fig.  2). The innovation was regarded 
as the preschool component of SuperFIT, the user was 
the preschool teacher. The inner setting involved direct 
contextual factors, for example, characteristics of the pre -
school organisation, the preschool itself, and the children 
attending the preschool. The outer setting included the 
broader context, such as societal influences. Following an 
abductive analysis strategy, researchers remained open 
for new insights in the data and analysis was not limited 
to determinants depicted in the framework [52]. Codes 
used were, for example, “complexity” or “relevance” 
(characteristics of the innovation), “self-efficacy” or “per -
ceived advantages” (characteristics of the user), “formal 
reinforcement” or “time” (inner setting), and “society” 
or “cooperation with external parties” (outer setting). In 
addition, “implementation” and “maintenance” codes were used to code descriptions of what actually hap -
pened. Maintenance started after completing the last 
SuperFIT activity (F&V delivery, May 2018). One of 
the two researchers then analysed the remainder of the 
interviews. A final meeting between the researchers was 
held to discuss any difficulties that arose during analysis. 
NVivo 12.0 (QSR International, Doncaster, Victoria, Aus -
tralia) was used to support data analysis.
Quantitative data
The quantitative data (from questionnaires and obser -
vations) were entered and cleaned before analysis. The 
scores on the CFAPQ of preschool teachers were aggre -
gated to achieve a preschool-level score (N=12). Descrip -
tive analyses were performed per measurement time 
point, on the data of the CFAPQ and observations. The 
sample size did not allow for further statistical testing 
and mean differences are presented. Analyses were per -
formed using SPSS Version 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, 
USA).
Results
Participants
A total of 32 interviews were held with a total of 49 
participants, as some of the interviews included mul -
tiple participants. The interviews lasted 42 minutes on 
average (see Table  1 for participants’ characteristics). 
Thirty-one preschool teachers (response rate (RR)= 
96.9%) filled in the CFAPQ at the first measurement, 24 
(RR= 75.0%) at the second measurement, and 25 (RR= 
78.1%) at the third measurement. Data was available for Fig. 2 Theoretical framework for the process evaluation within the preschool setting; adapted from the Implementation Framework [28] and the 
Consolidated Framework For Implementation Research [27]

at least one teacher of each preschool at all measurement 
moments. At the first measurement, 26 preschool teach -
ers (RR=81.3%) filled in the process questionnaire, at the 
final measurement 25 preschool teachers (RR=78.1%) 
filled in the process questionnaire. Observations for the 
physical environment were done at all preschools on all 
measurement moments. For the social environment, 
observations were performed for 10 groups (76.9%).
Implementation of SuperFIT
Various intervention activities were implemented dur -
ing the implementation phase (April 2017 – May 2018). 
On average, 89.0% of the preschool staff attended one 
or more of the off-the-job training sessions. In total, 42 
different types of F&V were delivered, all preschools 
received 20 different types of PA-related materials and 
ten types of nutrition-related materials.
Integration of SuperFIT in daily practice
It took some time for preschool staff to start implement -
ing activities and/or using materials, and differences 
were observed between preschools (see also Supplemen -
tary Table S1). Nonetheless, a majority of the preschool 
teachers eventually used the materials. During the obser -
vations, on average around one SuperFIT PA-related 
material was used by staff and one to two PA-related 
materials were used by the preschoolers. If staff used 
SuperFIT nutrition-related materials (7 or 8 locations), 
they always used the water tap. Preschoolers used on 
average around one nutrition-related material, which was 
most often the nutrition-related toys. Over time, more 
SuperFIT materials became visible in the preschools, and 
more staff used PA-related cards. Nutrition-related cards 
were hardly used. Preschool staff also started demon -
strating other initiatives to integrate SuperFIT into their 
daily practice. For example, they started thinking about 
how to further reduce sedentariness. Preschool staff  
also indicated that over time they became more flexible 
in their daily structures to allow for more (short) active 
games.Maintenance of SuperFIT
Maintenance was explicitly addressed from the start of 
the project. Both the PA-providing organisation and the 
preschool organisation intended to continue SuperFIT 
after the initial implementation phase. All preschool 
teachers indicated that SuperFIT had become a way 
of working for them and continued using the materi -
als and some of the cards. They continued to reflect on 
their routines and structures in order to increase PA (e.g., 
removing chairs to decrease the amount and frequency of 
sitting) or support healthy nutrition (e.g., preparing food 
together with the children). The ending of the F&V deliv -
ery greatly decreased the variety of F&V offered, as pre -
schools were again dependent on the F&V that children 
brought with them from home. However, serving only 
water had become a habit.
Dissemination of SuperFIT
For the preschool organisation, the maintenance phase 
also focussed on the dissemination of SuperFIT to its 
remaining ECE locations. The organisation formulated 
a vision regarding healthy behaviours in ECE and inte -
grated this into their policies. Although two manag -
ers were trained as so-called ‘healthy childcare-coach’ 
(part of a nationwide initiative ‘Healthy Childcare’ in 
the Netherlands [53]), dissemination of SuperFIT was 
not centrally coordinated by the organisation. Therefore, 
how SuperFIT was disseminated depended heavily on 
the motivation and efforts of individual managers. Dis -
semination was further influenced by available resources 
(time and finances).
The innovation (preschool component)
The preschool staff mentioned that the enthusiasm of the 
implementers sparked their own enthusiasm for Super -
FIT during the implementation phase. The quantitative 
process evaluation (Supplementary Table S2) showed 
that preschool teachers on average thought that Super -
FIT was a good programme, and they found it interest -
ing and instructive. The implementers were perceived as 
qualified.

Relevance of SuperFIT activities
The preschool staff considered the SuperFIT training 
and coaching as the most relevant parts of the approach 
(see Table  2 for all facilitating and hindering factors). 
The training off-the-job was appreciated (7.0, scale 1-10) 
because it provided the opportunity for staff to share 
experiences. The coaching on-the-job was found particu -
larly relevant (7.4, scale 1-10), because it helped in apply -
ing SuperFIT into practice. Further, preschool staff found 
it very important that the implementer experienced their 
daily struggles. Some managers and implementers stated 
that the F&V delivery and materials were the easiest to 
implement, as they did not necessarily require active 
behavioural change on the part of the preschool staff.
Incongruence with current practice
During the implementation phase, preschool staff expe -
rienced incongruence between SuperFIT and their cur -
rent practice. Due to time constraints, staff also felt that 
they were being forced to make choices between activi -
ties. However, transferring into the maintenance phase, 
staff increasingly recognized that SuperFIT was an add-
in programme rather than an add-on one, facilitating 
integration within practice. Perception of barriers that 
were important during the implementation phase (e.g., 
limitations in the physical environment) decreased, and 
this assisted staff in integrating SuperFIT into their daily 
practice. Staff indicated that time was needed to integrate 
SuperFIT into their daily practice. The duration of the 
programme allowed for this, although time constraints 
remained important in the maintenance phase.
During the implementation phase, some SuperFIT 
activities were perceived to be inappropriate for the pre -
schoolers, such as some of the cards (too difficult) and 
the F&V delivery (too ‘exotic’). However, in the mainte -
nance phase, SuperFIT was described as being relevant 
for the preschoolers as it helped them get acquainted 
with new tastes and promoted PA (Supplementary Table 
S2).
Lack of innovativeness
Not all SuperFIT content was experienced as innova -
tive or relevant, and often preschool teachers felt that it 
was not them that needed to change. Some aspects were 
lacking in SuperFIT, such as in-depth discussion of top -
ics during the training (e.g., nutritional value of food) or 
changes to the outdoor play area.
Bottom‑up or top‑down
It was suggested that a stronger bottom-up approach, 
i.e., involving preschool staff more from the start of the 
development, might have resulted in a better fit of the 
different preschool activities. This factor was mentioned for both the implementation and maintenance phase. 
An anticipated barrier, predominantly by managers and 
implementers, was preschool staff not being willing to 
participate in such bottom-up processes.
The user: preschool staff
The majority of the preschool staff were sceptical at the 
start of the implementation phase and lacked motivation 
to participate. However, an increased awareness among 
preschool staff about the goals and purpose of SuperFIT 
changed their attitudes. They became more enthusiastic 
and willing to integrate SuperFIT into their daily practice.
Attitude and motivation
In the maintenance phase, most participants expressed 
that they felt it part of their job to promote healthy nutri -
tion and PA, and were convinced that they could make a 
difference for the children. The idea was expressed that 
the ECE setting served as an example for parents, and 
that it was a place where children could at least become 
acquainted with healthy nutrition and PA. However, the 
influence of the home environment was also recognised 
as a hindering factor for changing preschoolers behav -
iour. All participants remained motivated to continue 
with SuperFIT in their work, although not all barriers 
were resolved (e.g., limited time and resources) and it 
was not felt necessary to change all things (e.g., birthday 
or Christmas celebrations).
Outcome expectations
Preschool staff were surprised how easily the preschool -
ers switched to water, but they found it hard to get them 
to taste the new F&V. This was further hampered by 
staff’s low outcome expectation, as they did not expect it 
to help preschoolers eat more F&V since the produce did 
not fit preschoolers’ preferences. On the other hand, the 
F&V delivery was appreciated the most of all SuperFIT 
activities by the preschool staff (average appreciation 8.4, 
scale 0-10) and was reckoned the most successful aspect 
of SuperFIT.
Self‑efficacy
Many of the preschool teachers stated that they did not 
always feel capable of implementing SuperFIT. Their 
reasons were predominantly related to their other tasks, 
characteristics of their location (e.g., limited space to use 
play materials), and fear of children hurting themselves 
or others. In the maintenance phase, increased self-effi -
cacy supported the integration of SuperFIT into the daily 
practice of preschool staff in the longer run. This was 
also reflected in the quantitative process evaluation (Sup -
plementary Table S1). They increasingly felt that it was

Implementation
Characteristics of the innovation: 
SuperFIT- Training off-the-job, in particular to 
share experiences with other teachers 
and experts.
- Coaching on-the-job.‘It is nice that you can share experiences 
like “how do you handle that?” … and it 
was nice that [the coach] came here to 
observe and give tips. ’ (PT)- Incongruence with current practice. ‘It is nice to hear, but then if you cannot 
apply it at your own preschool, I think 
that’s a shame. ’ (PT)
- Enthusiasm of the implementers. ‘I liked it a lot, that you can use the 
expertise of others who are enthusiastic 
about their profession and you also get 
a piece of the pie. ’ (PT)- No changes in the outdoor play area 
(e.g., provision of fixed outdoor play 
materials).‘I had hoped for more things for outside, 
the design … Our playgrounds are so 
boring. ’ (PT)
- Supportive materials to implement 
changes within the preschool loca-
tion (e.g., the water tap).‘We started with the tap. Let them tap 
water themselves … and not one child 
has asked for lemonade since. ’ (PT)- Limited appropriateness for pre -
schoolers (e.g., cards too difficult to 
understand, too exotic F&V).‘But passion fruit, with the seeds and all, 
and the papaya was also hardly eaten 
and then I think … this may be too much’ . 
(PT)
- Ready-made activities (e.g., delivery 
of materials/F&V).‘If you do not have to put in that much 
effort, like the F&V delivery, then it is easy 
to implement’ . (M)- Predominantly top-down develop -
ment of the intervention.‘I thought it would have been good if a 
small group of preschool teachers dis -
cussed things together, some cooperation 
or consultation’ . (M)
- Long overall duration of the pro -
gramme.‘It has to sink in, you have to experiment 
a bit and then you see that you changed 
your approach into something that 
works … this does not happen after the 
first training’ . (PT)- Lack of innovativeness (content of 
SuperFIT) for the preschool staff.‘I was not really inspired. I felt like much of 
the ideas that arose, that we already do 
that. It was not new to me. ’ (PT)
Characteristics of the user: pre -
school teacher- Preschool staff’s previous experience 
with PA, through training or work 
experience.‘You have to be creative with it, that’s 
something you learn with experience. ’ 
(PT)- Preschool staff’s initial negative 
attitude towards the programme and 
lack of motivation to participate.‘I also thought that everyone was a bit 
hesitant, like, let’s wait and see what’s 
coming at us, does this suit us?’ (PT)
- Awareness among staff about the 
purpose of the intervention.‘Eventually, we learned that it’s the little 
things that matter and then it is possible 
to integrate it. ’ (PT)- Low outcome expectations of the 
preschool staff to change children’s 
EBRBs due to expected lack of coop -
eration of the children.‘I mean, we try, but they won’t even 
taste it and then I think: “what did we 
achieve?”’ (PT)
- Low self-efficacy of staff due to 
other tasks, and characteristics of their 
location or group.‘At the beginning I thought “Do we get 
something extra to do again? We already 
have so little time … ”’ (PT)
Characteristics of the inner setting: 
preschool organisation- Health promotion (PA and healthy 
nutrition) was part of the organisa-
tional vision.‘We were already thinking of promoting 
a healthy lifestyle within our organisa-
tion before SuperFIT, but we hadn’t 
started yet, so it [SuperFIT] was right up 
our alley. ’ (M)- Characteristics of the preschool 
location (e.g., limited space, crowded 
arrangement of the room, and limited 
availability of an outdoor play area).‘[The room] is already full, it is too small. ’ 
(PT)
- Support for SuperFIT within the 
organisation.‘It was always nice that some managers 
or even the director were present [at 
the training sessions for teachers] to see 
what was going on. ’ (PT)- Limited time available with the chil-
dren (i.e., limited opening hours).‘I need more time if I want to do every -
thing and if I want to add this [SuperFIT] 
too, then I just need more time at the 
preschool. ’ (PT)

- Group composition and character -
istics of the children (e.g., language 
difficulties or age differences).‘It really depends on the group. Some -
times you can do everything and some -
times you can do nothing, that’s typical 
for preschoolers, right?’ (M)
- Lack of information provision from 
the organisation.‘I had hoped that [the organization] 
would have put more effort in making 
the preschool teachers enthusiastic 
about SuperFIT at the start … Preschool 
teachers did not know what SuperFIT was 
about. ’ (I)
Characteristics of the outer setting - Preschool situated within primary 
school building that also supported 
health promotion.‘Because we’re part of a primary school 
that’s a “healthy school” , we’re also kind 
of obliged [to serve only water]. ’ (PT)- Limited access to the gym, due to 
requirements of the primary school.‘Look, it’s a cooperation with the primary 
school, we used to use the gym more 
often … now it has become a larger 
school, so we can do less. ’(PT)
- Current attention for healthy nutri-
tion and physical activity in society.‘A healthy lifestyle is increasingly 
being put on the societal agenda, it’s 
considered increasingly important, also 
due to the increasing prevalence of 
overweight. ’(I)- Low perceived support from parents 
for healthy nutrition and PA within 
the preschool setting.‘It is a pity that you receive little feedback 
from parents, not only on this topic but 
also more in general. ’(PT)
- Strict rules and regulations of the 
Community Health Authority, e.g., 
regarding safety or hygiene, limiting 
PA.‘Just this morning I was playing on the 
floor, but the floor isn’t that clean. And I 
started to think “What would the Com-
munity Health Service think about this?”’ 
(PT)
Maintenance
Characteristics of the innovation: 
SuperFIT- Congruence with current practice. ‘Then we realised that you could also 
look at it differently and indeed can 
integrate it in your normal routines, by 
doing things just a bit different. Then it is 
possible to integrate it. ’ (PT)- Predominantly perceived top-down 
approach.‘The idea of SuperFIT was still conceived 
behind a desk … it’s not the result of 
a need from the staff. They didn’t state 
“we think our community needs to be 
healthier” . (M)
- Relevance for the preschools. ‘I think that the things the preschool 
teachers are taught about how to be 
physically active with the children, are 
concrete things they can use. ’ (M)
Characteristics of the user: pre -
school teacher- Positive attitude towards creating a 
healthy environment for preschoolers.‘Then I think, at least they got that bit 
here … because we have a varied offer 
[of F&V], they can taste different things, 
that’s what we can give them. ’ (PT)- Low outcome expectations of only 
changing the preschool setting, 
particularly the home setting should 
also be addressed.‘To what extent can you influence it? If it 
doesn’t address the home situation, then 
things won’t change. ’ (PT)

something they were able to incorporate in their daily 
practice.
The inner setting
SuperFIT fitted well with the vision of the organisation 
on healthy nutrition and PA in the preschool setting. 
Therefore, preschool staff felt that the organisation was 
committed to SuperFIT, which was reflected in the pres -
ence of management at the different activities. In the 
maintenance phase, this vision supported the formula -
tion/reformulation of policies and the initiation of several 
organisational processes to maintain SuperFIT, such as 
the training of two managers to become ‘Healthy Child -
care Coach’ .
Managers had a preference for PA-related activities 
rather than nutrition-related activities. Nutrition was 
regarded more difficult to change, and healthy nutrition 
was considered to be an ambiguous subject.
Characteristics of the preschool group
Several characteristics of the preschool groups that 
influenced the implementation and maintenance phases 
were mentioned. Age differences between the children, 
language issues, (motor) developmental delays in chil -
dren, behavioural problems of children, and the high 
number of children present influenced the integration 
of SuperFIT into daily practice. These barriers appeared 
especially important because the preschools were situ -
ated in low socioeconomic communities.
Provision of information
Information provision to the preschool staff was recog -
nised as a limiting factor for the implementation phase. 
Preschool staff felt they were insufficiently informed 
about what was expected from them. They also men -
tioned that they wanted more information about the 
family component and felt that the preschool and fam -
ily components were not one integrated programme.
Resources
Several factors related to the availability of resources 
were mentioned for both the implementation and 
maintenance phase. For the implementation phase, the 
physical make-up of the room (i.e., available space or 
arrangement of the room), available time with the chil -
dren, competing tasks, and high workload were cited. 
Within the whole organisation, high workload was 
experienced as a limiting factor for the integration of 
SuperFIT. With regard to resources in the maintenance 
phase, specifically the limited availability of funds influenced how SuperFIT could be maintained. Some 
activities were terminated (e.g., the F&V delivery) 
and almost all activities needed an alternative form of 
delivery (e.g., training of the preschool staff). However, 
managers tried to find solutions to integrate SuperFIT 
given the limited resources.
The outer setting
For both the implementation and maintenance phase, 
collaboration with the primary school was an important 
influential factor, as most preschools were located within 
the same building as the primary school. This was expe -
rienced as hindering when agreements had to be made 
about the use of the physical education room or outdoor 
play area. On the other hand, it was facilitating if the 
primary school was also actively involved in health pro -
motion. Continuity between the preschool and primary 
school (e.g., with regard to birthday treats and water 
drinking policy) was considered important for imple -
menting changes, but also to achieve maintained healthy 
EBRBs in children.
Societal attention
The current societal attention for healthy nutrition and 
PA in general, but also specific for the ECE setting, was 
experienced as being supportive. However, both pre -
school staff and managers felt that most parents did not 
concern themselves with healthy nutrition or PA in the 
ECE setting.
Rules and regulations
Rules and regulations of the Community Health Author -
ity were considered a limiting factor. Preschool staff felt 
that rules related to, for example, safety and hygiene lim -
ited the possibilities for changes in PA or nutrition.
Changes in the preschool setting
According to the participants, an increased awareness 
of the role of preschool staff also led to changes in their 
behaviour, such as using different types of play materi -
als, more teacher-initiated play, and using different tech -
niques to help preschoolers try new F&V.
Nutrition‑ and physical activity‑related practices
This was also reflected in the nutrition- and PA-related 
practices of the preschool teachers (Table  3). For most 
practices, a positive change was seen (not statistically 
tested). Related to PA, the greatest improvements were 
seen for ‘Modelling’ and ‘Planning time for active play’ at 
the first follow-up. Other improvements were predomi -
nantly moderate and some small. Most changes were still 
visible at the final follow-up, although they decreased 
Page 13 of 18
 van de Kolk et al. Implementation Science          (2021) 16:101 
 
in size. At the first follow-up, a moderate, undesired 
increase was observed for ‘Not letting the children play 
out of fear of them getting dirty’ , but this did not persist 
at the final follow-up. Related to nutrition, large improve -
ments were seen for ‘Modelling & Encourage balance and 
variety’ and ‘Emotion regulation & Food as reward’ , all 
other improvements were mainly moderate. The majority 
of the improvements persisted over time, some increased 
(e.g., ‘Involvement & Environment’), while others 
decreased (e.g., ‘I allow children to help prepare meals’).
Social preschool environment
Other changes in the social preschool environment were 
also observed (Supplementary Table S3). The changes 
increased over time, which supports preschool staff’s 
perceptions. Staff started using more play materials, 
both outdoors and indoors. During indoor play, staff also 
increasingly initiated activities. However, staff did not 
initiate outdoor activities. Staff showed more support -
ive behaviours for PA (e.g., encourage PA). Indoors, staff  
showed some limiting behaviours for PA (e.g., stimulat -
ing children to stay seated) and this did not change over 
time.
Physical preschool environment
Besides the materials that were provided as part of 
SuperFIT, no major changes were seen in the physical 
environment (Supplementary Table  4). The availability 
of portable play materials increased over time in both 
indoor and outdoor play areas. A decrease was seen in 
the availability of vegetables at preschools over time, 
most likely due to termination of the F&V delivery (Sup -
plementary Table S5). Eventually, all preschools switched 
to only serving water to children.
Discussion
This process evaluation explored factors influenc -
ing implementation and maintenance of the SuperFIT 
approach and changes the preschool setting. At the start 
of the implementation phase, predominantly barriers 
were perceived (e.g., incongruence with current practice, 
group composition, and the negative attitude of the pre -
school staff). These barriers are also described for other 
interventions in the ECE setting [33, 34, 36, 54]. Over 
time, as staff got more acquainted with the approach, this 
negative tendency transformed into a more positive view. 
Although it unclear how much time is exactly needed 
and this likely differs between interventions and context, 
sufficient time to implement is thus crucial for success -
ful implementation [55, 56]. Preschool staff participat -
ing in SuperFIT needed time to prepare for change. As 
a result, it may take some time for intervention effects 
to emerge, and sufficient programme duration and follow-up is essential for detecting these effects [22]. 
Sequential implementation of intervention components 
over a longer period of time may assist in implementa -
tion and support effectiveness, as staff are able to expe -
rience small successes and are not overburdened with 
intervention activities [56, 57]. The integration of Super -
FIT into daily practice was supported by organisational 
support, increased understanding of the purpose of the 
approach, and heightened appreciation for the interven -
tion activities from preschool staff. It appeared that over 
time, SuperFIT increasingly became part of the system in 
which it was being implemented, which caused contex -
tual factors to become more supportive for integration in 
practice [30].
An important barrier for implementation and mainte -
nance was the perceived top-down approach of SuperFIT. 
Although efforts were taken to involve preschool staff  
(e.g., continued needs assessment and active involve -
ment of the preschool organisation in development), 
this appeared to be insufficient for staff to feel involved. 
Involvement of the target group can take several forms, 
of increasing intensity [58]. From the primary school set -
ting it is known that mutual adaptation processes (i.e., 
combining top-down and bottom-up approaches) may 
be essential for successful intervention implementation 
[59, 60]. To our knowledge, such processes have not yet 
been described for intervention development in the ECE 
setting. Although this approach also has barriers (such 
as time and resources needed), efforts should be taken to 
increase bottom-up intervention development.
Group composition and characteristics of the children 
were important barriers throughout the implementation 
and maintenance phase. Research has shown that chaos 
at childcare negatively influences the coping responses of 
childcare staff [61]. This may limit their perceived pos -
sibilities to implement SuperFIT elements when groups 
were perceived as ‘difficult’ . Further, research has shown 
that child characteristics (e.g., child sex and age) influ -
ence their EBRBs [62, 63] and also interact with the ECE 
environment (e.g. child temperament) [64], indicating 
that different children might need different approaches. 
Tailoring of interventions to the characteristics of chil -
dren and groups may support implementation.
Changes in the ECE setting as a result of SuperFIT 
were predominantly seen in the social environment. 
Improvements in the nutrition- and PA-related prac -
tices of the preschool staff were observed, although these 
could not be statistically tested due to the small sample 
size. Staff were also using more play materials and initiat -
ing more activities indoors. Effects of other interventions 
on the social ECE environment have been inconclusive, 
with some showing changes in the practices of staff while 
others did not [65–69]. Few changes were seen in the 
Page 14 of 18 van de Kolk et al. Implementation Science          (2021) 16:101 
physical environment, except for the SuperFIT materi -
als that were provided. Although intervention studies 
have been inconclusive, a review showed that changes 
in the physical environment can evoke large effects on 
behaviour [70–72]. The importance of the physical envi -
ronment for EBRBs, also specifically in the ECE setting, 
has been established [6, 9, 63, 73–76]. More attention 
for the physical environment (e.g., the outdoor play area) may be supportive to help promote healthy EBRBs in 
preschoolers. In addition, interaction between the types 
of environments should be taken into account, since, 
for example, changes in the physical environment also 
demand changes in the social environment to have any 
effect on preschoolers’ EBRBs [40, 77].
An important issue mentioned in this process evalua -
tion was the influence of other settings on the behaviour Table 3 Changes in nutrition- and physical activity-related practices of preschool staff

of preschoolers. Therefore, the role of the preschool set -
ting in preschoolers’ EBRBs was experienced as limited. 
The home setting (parents) was described as mainly 
responsible for preschoolers’ EBRBs, in particular related 
to nutrition. This may be true for preschools in the Neth -
erlands, as they only provide a ‘snack moment’ . However, 
other types of childcare (e.g., full-day childcare) contrib -
ute for a large part to the dietary intake of children and 
attention to healthy nutrition is very important here [78]. 
Still, the home setting exerts a great influence on child 
EBRBs for example [79–82]. Furthermore, research has 
shown that inconsistencies between the ECE and home 
setting may have negative effects on children’s EBRBs 
[83]. It remains important to integrate these settings into 
interventions on preschoolers’ EBRBs to decrease the 
inconsistencies between the ECE and home settings.
Implications for implementation
Our study identified some implications for implementa -
tion research. First, it appeared important to take suf -
ficient time before starting the implementation to get 
all stakeholders involved on the same page. Providing 
information on the programme, but also making sure 
the required preconditions are met (e.g., reimbursement 
of invested time) is essential to take into account in this 
preparation phase. Second, intervention implementation 
should not be considered a temporary effort. To increase 
integration within practice and thus intervention success 
long-term commitment is needed. This may be facili -
tated through cooperation with practice partners who are 
able to have this long-term commitment. This may not 
always be possible within research institutions. Third, a 
participatory approach in development and implemen -
tation can increase the acceptability of the changes that 
the intervention aims to achieve. Last, for the success 
of implementation it is important to be open-minded to 
adaptations to the programme to support the fit to the 
local setting [84].
Strengths and limitations of the study
The mixed-methods design of this study made data tri -
angulation possible, by integrating the quantitative and 
qualitative data in the interpretation phase. Both quan -
titative and qualitative data were available and ensured 
an elaborate understanding of processes that influenced 
implementation and maintenance. This process evalua -
tion also goes beyond studying the ‘quantitative’ concepts 
that are more traditionally used to describe implementa -
tion. The theoretical framework that was adopted sup -
ported this more elaborate study of implementation and 
maintenance, including context. Furthermore, various 
stakeholders were included in the study, which made it 
possible to study the implementation and maintenance of SuperFIT from different perspectives. Research methods 
were flexible, which enabled the researcher to, for exam -
ple, add interview rounds when it became evident that 
this would increase the understanding of implementation 
and maintenance.
This study describes the factors that influenced imple -
mentation and maintenance of SuperFIT, which was 
implemented in a specific region in the Netherlands. 
Results of this study may not be generalisable to other 
intervention programmes or regions. However, the les -
sons learned from this study may be valuable for all inter -
vention developers and implementers. Furthermore, the 
importance of a contextual approach to intervention 
development and implementation is highlighted, which 
takes into account the specific contextual factors that 
may be of influence in a particular region or for a spe -
cific organisation [30, 31]. The quantitative analyses were 
performed on a preschool level, which resulted in a small 
sample size (N=12). Therefore, no statistical testing was 
possible. For the observational data, nine preschool (10 
groups) were included. Observations were ended after 
saturation had occurred to support feasibility of the 
data collection. Selection bias may have occurred in the 
recruitment of the preschool teachers for the interviews. 
These were performed on a voluntary basis and this may 
have resulted in the participation of preschool teachers 
with a more positive view on SuperFIT. However, the 
quantitative process evaluation was performed among all 
preschool teachers participating in SuperFIT.
Conclusion
Several factors influenced the implementation and 
maintenance of the SuperFIT approach in preschools. 
Over time, some of these factors changed from barri -
ers to facilitators, indicating the importance of allow -
ing sufficient time for implementation and follow-up to 
be able to initiate and detect change. Changes mainly 
occurred in the social environment. An important per -
ceived change was improved awareness of the preschool 
staff of their influence on preschoolers’ EBRBs. This may 
be a prerequisite for behavioural changes to occur and 
indicates the importance of involvement of preschool 
staff in the early phases of intervention development. 
Bottom-up or mutual adaptation approaches may sup -
port this, although active involvement of preschool staff  
is required, which may be regarded as a barrier for such 
approaches.
