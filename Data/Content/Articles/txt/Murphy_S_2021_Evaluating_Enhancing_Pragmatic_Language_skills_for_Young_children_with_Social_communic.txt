Abstract
Background: This article reports the results from a feasibility study of an intervention ( ‘E-PLAYS ’) aimed at
supporting children who experience difficulties with social communication. E-PLAYS is based around a dyadic
computer game, which aims to develop collaborative and communication skills. A pilot study found that when E-
PLAYS was delivered by researchers, improvements on communication test scores and on collaborative behaviours
were observed. The aim of this study was to ascertain the feasibility of running a full-scale trial to test the
effectiveness of E-PLAYS in a National Health Service (NHS) setting with delivery by speech and language therapists
and teaching assistants.
Methods: The study was a two-arm feasibility cluster-randomised controlled trial of the E-PLAYS intervention with a
treatment as usual control arm. Data relating to recruitment and retention, treatment fidelity, acceptability to
participants, suitability of outcomes and feasibility of collecting health economic measures and of determining cost-
effectiveness were collected.
Speech and language therapists selected suitable children (ages 4 –7 years old) from their caseload. E-PLAYS
intervention (experimental group) was then delivered by teaching assistants overseen by speech and language
therapists. The control group received usual care. Assessments included blinded language measures and
observations, non-blinded teacher-reported measures of peer relations and classroom behaviour and non-blinded
parent-reported use of health and education resources and quality of life.

Results: Planned recruitment was for 70 children, in the event, 50 children were recruited which was sufficient for
feasibility purposes. E-PLAYS was very highly rated by children, teaching assistants and speech and language
therapists and treatment fidelity did not pose any issues. We were able to collect health economic data which
suggests that E-PLAYS would be a low-cost intervention.
Conclusion: Based on recruitment, retention and adherence rates and our outcome measures, a full-scale
randomised controlled trial estimated appears feasible and warranted to assess the effectiveness of E-PLAYS for use
by the NHS and schools.
Trial registration: ISRCTN 14818949 (retrospectively registered).

Key messages
/C15What uncertainties existed regarding the feasibility?
The study aimed to establish the feasibility of
delivering the E-PLAYS intervention in schools. An
earlier pilot study by the authors had demonstrated
that, when delivered by researchers, an earlier ver-
sion of E-PLAYS produced significant gains in prag-
matic language test scores and communication skills
compared to a control group. The areas of uncer-
tainty concerned delivery of E-PLAYS by speech and
language therapists and teaching assistants and the
impact that this may have on intervention fidelity
and acceptability, also the ease of recruitment for a
large-scale study.
/C15What are the key feasibility findings? Acceptability
was very high and intervention fidelity was good.
However, there were some challenges in relation to
recruitment and retention. Recruitment was via
speech and language therapists who examined their
caseloads for children fitting the inclusion and
exclusion criteria and then approached schools. One
unintended consequence of this recruitment strategy
was that the demographic profiles of the parents of
the children recruited were largely White British,
graduates and in fulltime employment. This was not
reflective of the North East London area in which
we were recruiting which was ethnically highly-
diverse and where several boroughs experience high
levels of poverty. However, this was consistent with
previous research which has found that well-
educated parents with higher socio-economic status
are better able to access services such as speech and
language therapy.
/C15What are the key implications of the feasibility
findings for the main study? Based on the outcomes
of our study, a full-scale trial appears feasible and
warranted to assess the effectiveness of E-PLAYS for
use by the NHS and schools. The low-cost,
computer-based nature of E-PLAYS makes it highlysuitable for national distribution. E-PLAYS was de-
signed ultimately to be widely shared and we have
used existing, easily updated technology which is
available within the NHS and in primary schools. A
vast number of commercially-available games are
targeted at parents of children with autism spectrum
disorders and other children with social communi-
cation impairments. Reviewers of the computer
game literature have urgently called for large-scale
studies to ensure these are based on a sound
evidence-base. A possible recruitment alternative
would be to approach schools directly without using
speech and language services as an intermediary. It
is likely that this would reach a wider demographic
in terms of socio-economic status and ethnicity.
Background
Children with social communication impairments strug-
gle to communicate effectively in social contexts; our E-
PLAYS intervention aims to provide them with support.
Difficulties with social communication can manifest
themselves as an inability to maintain a topic of conver-
sation or take turns appropriately, misunderstanding of
non-literal language such as jokes, irony or sarcasm, fail-
ure to make inferences and repair communication
breakdowns. Responding appropriately, interpreting
others ’communications whilst at the same time under-
standing society ’s norms and expectations constitutes
pragmatic language skill [ 1,2].
The terms ‘social communication ’and ‘pragmatic lan-
guage ’are often used interchangeably. Recent systematic
reviews of interventions for ‘social communication im-
pairments ’or‘pragmatic language impairments ’[3,4]
have adopted broad definitions for these terms encom-
passing both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communi-
cation to include abilities such as facial expression use as
well as spoken language [ 5]. For the purposes of our
study, however, we have adopted Matthews et al. ’s
(2018) [ 6] suggestion and defined ‘pragmatics ’more spe-
cifically as the linguistic component (excluding facialMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 2 of 18
communication and other non-verbal communication)
of social communication.
Children with social communication impairments are
highly heterogeneous. The Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V [ 7];) and the Inter-
national Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems (ICD 10 [ 8]) both list a number of devel-
opmental disorders (such as autism) and language disor-
ders concerned with social communication. Furthermore,
ADHD [ 9] and conduct disorders [ 10,11]h a v ea l s ob e e n
shown to impact on social communication.
It is important to remember, however, that many chil-
dren will experience difficulties with social communica-
tion without ever receiving diagnoses and there are
indications that this is particularly the case for children
of low socio-economic status [ 10,12,13].
Pragmatic language difficulties can have profound and
long-lasting effects on emotional functioning and peer
relations [ 14,15]. Children are frequently rejected and
victimised by peers [ 16,17], and in adulthood, social re-
lationships continue to be a challenge [ 18].
Schools aim to facilitate children ’s learning and train
team-building skills for adulthood through collaborative
activities [ 19–22]. Collaborative working has also been
shown to improve peer relations and facilitate children ’s
feelings of belonging [ 23,24]. A systematic review by
Chang and Locke (2016) [ 25] concluded that the inclusion
of peers was one of the most promising strategies for so-
cial skills intervention. A recent review [ 26] concluded that
collaborative learning activities are particularly beneficial
for low-ability children at younger ages (4 –7 years old).
Studies which have observed peer collaborations in-
volving children with social communication impairments
[27–29] have consistently shown that such children fail
to contribute appropriately, sharing less, making more
irrelevant statements, ignoring others and showing ag-
gressive or withdrawn behaviours and consequently, they
are often excluded by peers. Enabling social interaction
between children with social communication impair-
ments and their peers demands considerable skill from
adult facilitators. The difficulties and resource implica-
tions of providing support for such children have tended
to result in their isolation within the classroom; Blatch-
ford et al. (2009) [ 30] have reported that typically, the
most common activity for children with special educa-
tional needs is one-to-one working with teaching assis-
tants and that consequently, rates of interaction with
teachers and peers are reduced by almost half [ 31].
There are few interventions available to SLTs and
schools for pragmatic language difficulties [ 3,4,32]; the
Social Communication Intervention Programme (SCIP) is
an example of an intervention with emerging evidence
[33] but it demands a substantial time input from SLTs.
The use of technology and gaming have been promoted asparticularly useful means of facilitating communication
and collaboration for children with communication diffi-
culties as they are especially appealing to this group of
children e.g. [ 34–36]. A systematic review and meta-
analysis of computer-assisted collaborative learning [ 37]
concluded that the intrinsic socio-cognitive scaffolding
can enhance collaborative skills substantially; thus, com-
puter games can facilitate communication and collabor-
ation between children [ 38–40]. Alt et al. (2012) [ 41]h a v e
pointed out that currently, peer collaborative activities for
children with communication and language impairments
rely heavily on adult specialist skill for facilitation; little
time or thought has been invested in the creation and de-
velopment of these activities. Technology can fill this gap
and be used to regulate turn-taking, participation and en-
force the rules [ 42] and can also add surprises, colourful
animations and unusual sounds and keep the game flow-
ing at a suitable pace [ 35,43].
Preliminary testing ( n= 32) for ‘E-PLAYS ’(formerly
known as the ‘Maze Game ’) is described in Murphy
et al. (2014a, 2014b) [ 29,44]. Children in the interven-
tion group showed significant increases on communica-
tion test scores by comparison to a control group [ 44].
In this preliminary study, the intervention was delivered
to the children by the research team The aim of the
present study was to establish the feasibility of running a
full-scale clinical trial to evaluate E-PLAYS ’clinical- and
cost-effectiveness when implemented within the NHS.
The study had the following feasibility objectives; to
assess:
1. Participant recruitment and retention (via NHS
trusts and schools)
2. The acceptability of E-PLAYS to children, SLTs,
teachers, parents and teaching assistants
3. Treatment fidelity.
4. The suitability of outcome measures
5. The feasibility of collecting health economic
measures and of determining cost-effectiveness for
a full trial
Method
Feasibility trial design
The study was a two-arm, cluster-randomised trial
(cRCT) to investigate the feasibility of conducting a suf-
ficiently powered trial to evaluate the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of E-PLAYS (compared with treatment
as usual) for young children with social communication
impairment.
Setting
We recruited speech and language therapists (SLTs)
employed by North East London NHS Foundation Trust
(NELFT) Speech and Language Services.Murphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 3 of 18
Participants
Speech and language therapists
The research team approached all suitably employed
paediatric SLTs. They were invited to presentations by
the team where they had the opportunity to ask ques-
tions and receive an information sheet and consent form
to take away. Consent forms were returned by post, elec-
tronically or by hand to the research team. SLTs not
responding within a week were reminded and invited
again by email once more only.
Focal children
Inclusion criteria SLTs screened all children on their
caseloads and identified children aged 4 to 7 years who
attended mainstream schools using the Social Commu-
nication Behaviour Checklist devised by Adams et al.
(2012) [ 45]. Children were required to meet at least two
of the five criteria as based on the SLT ’s clinical judge-
ment below:
/C15The child has trouble understanding and
interpreting the social context and friendship, e.g.
social roles, emotions
/C15The child has trouble understanding and/or using
non-verbal aspects of communication, e.g. facial ex-
pression, intonation
/C15The child has trouble with aspects of conversation,
e.g. beginning and ending, taking turns, giving
relevant and sufficient information
/C15The child makes bizarre, tangential or inappropriate
comments
/C15The child has difficulty using and understanding
non-literal language
Children were also required to have at least minimum
levels of English (children with English as an additional
language were included). We wished to be as inclusive
as possible; teachers were consulted about children ’s
level of English and all those regarded as having suffi-
cient levels of English were included. The parents of
every child meeting the above criteria were invited to
participate in the study.
Exclusion criteria
/C15Hearing, visual or physical impairment severely
affecting speech production
Parents
The research team provided schools with participant in-
formation sheets to send to parents of eligible children,
one for parents and one written in simpler language for
the child, with consent forms for parents to sign toauthorise their child ’s participation and to indicate their
willingness to complete health economic questionnaires.
Teachers and teaching assistants
The teachers and teaching assistants of focal children
were invited to take part in the study and received infor-
mation sheets and consent form. Some teachers and
teaching assistants were associated with more than one
focal child.
Partners for focal children for the E-PLAYS intervention
Suitable partner children were suggested by teachers and
teaching assistants in consultation with the SLT. These
partner children were typically-developing children with-
out language disorders in the same class as the focal
children. Schools were provided with participant infor-
mation sheets for parents of the partner children, again
one for parents and one for children, with a consent
form.
All participants were given the option of contacting
the Chief Investigator in the event of additional ques-
tions and were informed that they were free to withdraw
at any time from the study.
Randomisation and allocation process
Focal children were cluster-randomised at the level of
their treating SLT. The SLTs were randomised 1:1 to the
intervention or comparator group after they had con-
sented to participate in the study and had identified and
recruited children on their caseloads but before they re-
ceived a briefing on E-PLAYS delivery from the research
team. Allocation was via minimisation to ensure balance
across the two groups on the borough of the SLT (five
boroughs covered by NELFT, each served by a different
SLT team) and the number of children recruited
(dichotomised around the median). Minimisation was
implemented by a trial statistician at York Trials Unit
using MinimPy version 0.3.
Blinding
Due to the nature of the intervention, SLTs, teachers,
teaching assistants, children and parents could not be
blinded to allocation. However, the research assistants col-
lecting outcome data were blinded (see the ‘Measures ’sec-
tion). Several different research assistants were associated
with this project and they did not conduct pre- and post-
test measures on the same children. We also ensured that
same research assistants did not conduct qualitative as-
sessments (where they were unblinded) with the same
children to whom they administered the TPS, CCT and
Recalling Sentences tests. At each visit to schools, staff
were reminded not to unblind research assistants.Murphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 4 of 18
Procedure and intervention
Intervention group: E-PLAYS
E-PLAYS has been designed to be administered by non-
specialists such as teaching assistants (as opposed to SLTs
or teachers) in 12 weekly sessions. SLTs randomised to
the intervention group received a 30-min briefing from
the research team together with a manual. The SLTs then
trained the teaching assistants in small groups for around
2 h in their schools and gave them the manual with which
to deliver E-PLAYS. SLTs gave teaching assistants further
support in the same way as they would usually when
introducing a new intervention if needed. Generally, most
teaching assistants were able to use the game readily, the
support that was given was very brief and amounted to a
maximum of 30 min per teaching assistant.
The E-PLAYS intervention is built around a dyadic
collaborative computer game. Children play the com-
puter game with a teaching assistant for eight, 30-min
sessions and with a classmate for four, 15-min sessions.
In their sessions, teaching assistants use the game to
guide the child through (a) requesting optimally useful
information, (b) giving helpful directions and answering
questions and (c) asking for clarification. Sessions with
the classmate give the focal child an opportunity to prac-
tice in live interaction the content of the sessions led by
the teaching assistants. Sessions one, five, six and twelve
were those with a peer; the other sessions were with the
TA only. Session one was designed as an introductory
session for the children to find their way around E-
PLAYS, sessions five and six were in the middle, for chil-
dren to practice new skills and the final session, twelve,
aimed to consolidate the skills learned.
Comparator group: usual practice
Usual practice for a child with social communication im-
pairment on an SLT ’s caseload typically comprises a
programme of activities, devised by the SLT who sup-
ports schools ’teaching assistants to deliver them (a ‘con-
sultancy model ’[46]). Activities typically [ 32,47] include
exercises on turn-taking, topic management and conver-
sational skills, sometimes with role-playing or modelling.
These are generally taught directly by an adult (e.g. a
teaching assistant) to the child one-to-one or in a small
group.
For both the intervention and the comparator group,
SLT visits to support the teaching assistants took place
around 3 –6 times per year.
Measures
(a) Measures administered and rated by blinded research
assistants
(i) Test of Pragmatic Skills, (TPS, [ 48])A major diffi-
culty inherent in researching pragmatic language skills isthat social communication difficulties generally manifest
only during social interaction itself and are therefore
usually missed by standard language tests [ 1]. Social
communication impairments are therefore best assessed
by direct observation. The TPS is an observational elicit-
ation measure. The tester engages the child in structured
but naturalistic play to elicit target behaviours and re-
sponses, which are audio-recorded and later scored.
Scoring time for the TPS is approximately 25 min. The
TPS was a sensitive indicator and successful at detecting
improvements in communication in our pilot study [ 44];
it has been standardised on 650+ children by the author.
The instrument shows good reliability (test-retest r=
0.96, interrater r= 0.92). A score between 0 and 42.5 is
given, where a higher score indicates greater pragmatic
language skill.
(ii) Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-5
(CELF-5, [ 49]).CELF-5 is one of the most widely-used
standard language tests by SLTs. We used one of the
subscales only, Recalling Sentences. This sentence repe-
tition assessment is generally regarded as a measure of
overall language ability drawing upon a wide range of
language processing skills [ 50]. The type of language
structures that are modelled in the intervention (e.g.
requesting clarification, providing directions) could po-
tentially lead to greater syntactic competence and an
ability to structure more coherent sentences. This sub-
scale therefore gives us an indication of the impact of E-
PLAYS on children ’s language as a whole by comparison
to the more specific social communication skills targeted
by the TPS.
Raw scores (0 –78) are used to calculate age-adjusted
scores between 1 and 19, where higher scores indicate
greater ability to recall and reproduce spoken sentences
accurately.
(iii) Dyadic collaborative construction task (CCT) A
frequently reported issue with interventions targeting
children with social communication impairments is that
the skills learned do not generalise beyond those of the
intervention context; furthermore, this skill transfer is
rarely measured [ 4]. A 10-min, collaborative construc-
tion task using Magformers® (a construction toy made
with plastic, brightly coloured, magnetised blocks) was
devised by the team as a transfer measure to observe
children ’s collaborative and communicative skills pre-
and post-intervention. Children undertook the task with
a peer (this was the same classmate pre- and post-test
and also for the intervention) and were video-recorded
by research assistants. The children followed instructions
and were asked to work together without adult input.
What we were observing, in this instance, was the ability,
not only of the peer to scaffold the focal child, but alsoMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 5 of 18
of the focal child to build up a collaborative working
relationship with the peer over time.
(b) Teacher-completed measures
(i) The Children ’s Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-
2, [51])The CCC-2 is the most widely used, standar-
dised questionnaire of communication impairment in re-
search and clinical contexts [ 1]. The CCC-2 has eight
subscales which can be combined to yield the General
Communication Composite, an indicator of overall com-
munication difficulty, on a scale from 3 to 133 (age-
dependent; higher scores indicate fewer difficulties). It
also includes four subscales (Initiation, Stereotyped Lan-
guage, Use of Context and Non-verbal Communication)
that may be considered to be more specifically con-
cerned with pragmatic language and can be combined to
give a Pragmatic Language Score [ 6] between 3 and 69
(age-dependent, higher scores indicate fewer difficulties).
(ii) The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ, [ 52]).The SDQ is a widely used mental health
indicator with subscales assessing behavioural, emotional
and peer problems. A total score for the SDQ was calcu-
lated from 0 to 40 (higher scores indicate greater diffi-
culties) and for the Prosocial subscale from 0 to 10
(higher scores indicate greater prosocial behaviour).
(c) Parent-completed measures
(i) Quality of Life: EQ-5D-Y (proxy 1) [ 53] and
Paediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL, [ 54])The EQ-5D-
Y (proxy 1) was developed as a child-friendly version of
the EQ-5D, the preferred instrument recommend by
NICE for clinical decision-making. The proxy version
asks caregiver to rate the child ’s health-related quality of
life. Given the population of the study, we were uncer-
tain as to whether the EQ-5D-Y (proxy-1) could offer
sufficient sensitivity, thus we also included the PedsQL
as a comparative instrument.
(ii) Resource use The ability to assess resource implica-
tions was piloted using a bespoke resource use question-
naire for parents. The costing approach was undertaken
from an NHS perspective and also considered the
perspectives of both Social Services and education
providers.
(d) Fidelity measures
Delivery of the computer game within E-PLAYS (dur-
ation and number of sessions) was automatically re-
corded by the E-PLAYS software and transmitted to the
research team; each child could be identified individually
by their unique PIN login.Process evaluation –qualitative investigation
A process evaluation was included in our study (as rec-
ommended by the Medical Research Council (MRC)
guidance for RCTs, [ 55]) to elucidate processes which
may impact on intervention delivery and measurement.
Processes examined were whether:
(a) Instructions for delivery of E-PLAYS were consid-
ered to be adequate
(b) Staff could use E-PLAYS with sufficient fidelity
(c) How acceptable staff and children found E-PLAYS
SLTs and teaching assistants in the intervention arm
received open-ended questionnaires within 2 weeks of
receiving the manual (SLTs) and of training (teaching
assistants); these assessed the clarity of instructions for
delivery of E-PLAYS. Ten teaching assistants in the
intervention group were invited to be observed whilst
delivering E-PLAYS and together with the corresponding
children were viewed live by research team members for
two E-PLAYS sessions each, observation of these ses-
sions concerned teaching assistants ’adherence to man-
ual instructions and teaching assistants were made
aware of this. These same children were also interviewed
about their experiences of E-PLAYS. Focus groups with
teaching assistants were conducted at the end of the
summer term in which E-PLAYS was delivered. The
child interviews and focus groups were concerned with
acceptability.
Data collection points for measures and qualitative
assessments
Data collection for the TPS, CCC-2, CELF-5 and SDQ
took place at baseline, 15 –20 weeks and 35 –40 weeks
post-randomisation. These time points are approxi-
mately equivalent to baseline, immediate post-
intervention and 3-month post-intervention follow-up
for the intervention group.
Analysis of the CCT is a resource-intensive research
activity requiring substantial input of research assistant
time. Therefore, as this was a feasibility study, the deci-
sion was taken to collect at baseline and 15 –20 weeks
only to save resources as the study was primarily con-
cerned with the viability and acceptability of collecting
this data rather than producing definitive analyses. All
health economic measures and demographic data were
collected at 35 –40 weeks post-randomisation. These data
were collected at one time point only as we have ob-
served in previous trials that whilst baseline data collec-
tion tends to be good, completion rates decline over
time hence administering the questionnaire at the end
time point gives us an indication of the likely minimum
level of data attainable whilst also reducing participant
burden.Murphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 6 of 18
Sample size
We aimed to recruit 70 focal children to provide reliable
estimates of sample size parameters [ 56].
Analysis
Analyses were conducted in Stata v15. Following CON-
SORT recommendations [ 57] for feasibility studies,
quantitative outcome measures were summarised de-
scriptively by group and time point, with no formal
between-group comparisons undertaken. Parameters re-
quired to calculate the sample size for a future full-scale
RCT were estimated. The variance of the TPS at each
time point was calculated with a 95% confidence interval
(CI). To estimate the intra-cluster correlation coefficient
for TPS scores at week 20 and 40, we used a three-level
mixed effects model (measurements nested in children
nested in SLTs), adjusting for the main effects of time
and allocation and their interaction, baseline TPS score
and the factors used in the minimisation algorithm as
fixed effects with random intercepts for SLT and child
nested in SLT. The correlation and 95% CI between the
TPS score at baseline and the two post-randomisation
time points were calculated.
The focus groups were audio-recorded and profession-
ally transcribed. Observations of the teaching assistants
were live and followed a checklist. Thematic analysis for
both followed the guidelines of Braun and Clarke (2006)
[58]: (1) becoming familiar with the data, (2) generating
initial codes, (3) searching for themes, (4) reviewing
themes and (5) defining and naming themes.
Data from the open-ended questionnaires were ana-
lysed by coding responses into categories known as a
‘coding frame ’[59]. Children ’s interviews were con-
ducted using the Fun Toolkit [ 60], a schedule designed
to probe children ’s views of technology. The Fun Tool
Kit asks children to rank the aspects of the game that
they liked best and to give an overall indication of how
much they liked the game.
For the CCT, video-recordings were transcribed by a
professional company and then coded by blinded re-
search assistants. Coding consisted of observation and
categorisation of communicative (e.g. Information-
Seeking Questions, Directives, Clarification Requests)
and affective (e.g. positive and negative behaviours)
items which have been found to differentiate children
with social communication impairments from typically-
developing children [ 44]. The coding system is based on
micro-analytic theory [ 61,62] and was developed by the
team specifically to analyse children ’s collaborative inter-
action. It was based on research in collaborative learn-
ing, conversation analysis and language impairment [ 29,
44,63–69]. We have used this system extensively and it
has previously successfully detected changes in talk in
our studies [ 29,44,64]. Research assistants were trainedto fidelity by the Chief Investigator by watching and cod-
ing training videos until they achieved a threshold of
concordance (that is, agreement with 80% of the codes
on the training videos). Inter-rater reliability was also
calculated between research assistants taking part in this
study using a random sample of 15% of all video-
recordings.
The costs of providing E-PLAYS were estimated in-
cluding accounting for development and ongoing main-
tenance costs where possible. An estimate of the costs of
running E-PLAYS within the NHS and schools was
calculated.
Results
Participant recruitment and flow
We approached 72 SLTs for participation, of which 45
(63%) did not respond, 14 (19%) were associated with a
school which declined to participate and one (1%) could
not identify any potentially eligible children on their
caseload (Fig. 1). The remaining 12 SLTs (17%) were
randomised into the trial (six to each group). Recruit-
ment of focal children commenced on 1st January 2018
and closed on 20th April 2018. Recruitment of children
(via parents) did not take place until schools had agreed
to participate. Recruitment was originally planned for
September 2017 –December 2017 but had to be delayed.
We recruited 50 focal children out of a target sample
size of 70 (24 in the intervention group and 26 in the
control). These children were recruited from 14 schools
(six intervention and eight control). One school (four
children) withdrew immediately following the baseline
visits due to flooding at the school. Another school (six
children) was unresponsive at the final data collection
point meaning no assessments could be undertaken.
SLTs recruited a mean of 4.2 children (SD 1.7, range 2
to 7). Children were aged, on average, 6.2 years (0.8) and
74% were male (Table 1). Characteristics relating to age,
gender and baseline assessments conducted appear
comparable between the two groups.
Fifty typically-developing children were recruited to
partner the focal children; 100% of parents ( n= 50) gave
consent for these children to take part in the study. All
participating SLTs ( n= 12) and 35 out of 39 participat-
ing teaching assistants returned the open-ended ques-
tionnaires. There were 19 teaching assistants in the
intervention group, 14 of these participated in the focus
groups which was as many as were available on the days
in question, all had been invited. Our aim was to observe
ten teaching assistants; ten were randomly selected and
approached. Of these, one declined, and therefore, nine
teaching assistants were observed delivering two E-
PLAYS sessions and nine children were observed in the
same E-PLAYS sessions and were then interviewed by
research assistants using the Fun Tool Kit [ 60].Murphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 7 of 18
The response rates for research assistant-administered
measures were 86% at 20 weeks and 78% at 40 weeks.
For teacher-completed measures response rates were
82% at 20 weeks and 62% at 40 weeks. Forty parent ques-
tionnaires were distributed at 40 weeks, of which 32
were returned.
Acceptability
Speech and language therapists
Responses to the questionnaire from SLTs indicated that
the training manual was favourably regarded by SLTs
and they commented on its clarity:
I found the manual very clear (SLT 2)
…the manual is so self-explanatory(SLT 5)
…the session by session breakdown [is] very helpful
(SLT 12)Teaching assistants
Similarly, teaching assistants commented positively on
the manual and especially on the illustrations:
Simply written. Easy with diagrams (TA4)
When it was unclear, I looked at the pictures and it
helped me (TA7)
Step by step explanations also very easy to follow (TA10)
There were few problems with running the game itself,
which had been designed to be easy to load and use.
During focus groups, teaching assistants were over-
whelmingly enthusiastic about the game.
He (name of child receiving intervention) loved it …
he really did love it. (TA4)
The game is brilliant (TA8)Fig. 1 Study flow diagramMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 8 of 18

It does make it fun that it is a game and it does help
them and make them want to
do it (TA9)
Teaching assistants were especially positive about the
involvement of typically-developing partner children and
stressed that both the partners and the focal children
enjoyed the game.
I think they are more relaxed with peers than an
adult (TA2)
…he really listened well; he listened better to (part-
ner name) than he does in class. (TA8)
Children
Children appeared to like all aspects of the game, par-
ticularly finding the ‘hidden treasures ’. Six of the nine
children interviewed rated the game as ‘good ’,‘really
good ’or‘brilliant ’. Teaching assistants explained that
one of the children who rated the game as ‘not very
good ’was upset at having to finish (because of school
timetabling) the game sooner than they wanted and the
two others were ‘having a bad day ’but did in general at
other times enjoy E-PLAYS.
School use
A further indication of the acceptability and popularity
of E-PLAYS is that after completion of data collection,
control group schools were offered the use of E-PLAYS.
All control group schools took up this offer; further-
more, many of the intervention group schools asked to
continue using E-PLAYS, with the result that we ex-
tended the licence to all participating schools until De-
cember 2019. In total, nine of the 14 participating
schools (2 of 6 in the intervention and 7 of 8 in the con-
trol group) were still using E-PLAYS 12 months after
study completion.
Intervention delivery and fidelity
Intervention fidelity: qualitative observations
During observations of the teaching assistants, we found
that all were able to use the software and set up the
game and all were able to keep the children on task. Less
positively, only three of the observed teaching assistants
followed manual recommendations to pause to give the
children time to respond to questions and remind chil-
dren of the collaborative nature of the task. Almost all
teaching assistants tended to intervene with the children
more than recommended instead of allowing the chil-
dren to explore the game.
The unanticipated delays in recruitment had a detri-
mental, knock-on effect on intervention delivery. E-
PLAYS is a 12-session intervention with one(recommended) session per week. Due to the recruit-
ment delays, many schools were left with only the end of
the summer term in which to deliver 12 sessions of E-
PLAYS and this was often less than 12 weeks. Schools
were therefore asked to deliver as many sessions as was
reasonably practicable. The mean number of sessions re-
ceived by the children in the intervention group was 6.2
(SD 4.3). Five children randomised to the intervention
group did not receive any E-PLAYS sessions. This was
due to one school being unable to commence E-PLAYS
for one child and another school (four children) with-
drawing immediately following the baseline visit due to
flooding at the school. Excluding the children from the
school which withdrew, then the mean number of ses-
sions received was 7.4 (SD 3.6). However, once schools
were able to begin delivering E-PLAYS, the average fre-
quency with which they delivered the E-PLAYS sessions
was within the recommended range. The mean fre-
quency of session completion was 1.1 sessions per week
(range 0.3 –2.6). Recommended duration for the sessions
where the focal child played with the teaching assistant
was 30 min (minimum 20 min, no maximum); actual
mean duration was 25.50 (SD 11.6) min. Recommended
duration for child and classmate peer partner sessions
was 15 min (minimum 10 min, no maximum); actual
mean duration was 28.72 (SD 12.47) min.
Children in the intervention group generally received
the early sessions with declining numbers receiving the
later sessions; all 19 children received session 1 but only
six children received session 12. Peer sessions required
as much adult input (in terms of supervision) as did the
teaching assistant only sessions so this was not a factor
impacting delivery. To illustrate, the number of children
receiving session 4 (teaching assistant only) = 17, session
5 (peer session) = 16, session 6 (peer session) = 12 and
session 7 (teaching assistant only) = 11 and session 12
(peer session) = 6.
Suitability of outcome measures and qualitative
processes
From the point of view of participant burden and ease of
administration, these outcome measures were generally
found to be suitable. Importantly, the TPS, CELF-5 and
CCT were blinded independent measures and we were
able to maintain blinding. On two occasions school staff
did inadvertently unblind research assistants despite be-
ing reminded. On these occasions, a different (blinded)
research assistant was substituted to administer the out-
come measure.
Table 2gives scores for research assistant-
administered and teacher-report measures. Improve-
ments in TPS score over time were observed in both
groups, as might be expected for this population. Scores
for other outcome measures were more mixed. There isMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 10 of 18
generally limited evidence for large differences be-
tween groups; few conclusions can be drawn, due to
the small number of participants and the possibility
of informatively missing (missing not at random) out-
come data.
Scores in general are typical of children with language
disorders. Of the 49 children with TPS scores at base-
line, 45 (91.8%) had scores below the 25th percentile of
the standardisation sample used in the development of
the TPS and 26 (53.1%) had scores below the 10th per-
centile. Similarly, 48 (96%) of the children in the sample
had baseline scores on the CELF-5 Recalling Sentences
subscale either at or below the mean score obtained by
the standardisation sample, with 34 (68%) having scores
more than one standard deviation below the standardisa-
tion sample mean score. This was also reflected in the
teacher-completed instruments. Of the 41 children with
a valid baseline score for the CCC-2 General Communi-
cation Composite, all of them had scores below the 20th
percentile of the standardisation sample, with 37 (90.2%)of these having scores below the 10th percentile. Of the
42 children with a valid SDQ Prosocial scale score at
baseline, 35 (83.3%) had scores below the mean score for
British children aged 5 –10 years (mean = 7.3, SD = 2.4)
and 23 (54.8%) had scores more than one standard devi-
ation below this mean.
We successfully achieved inter-rater reliability be-
tween the research assistants (weighted kappa = 0.69).

Cost and resource use data collection
(i) Quality of Life
Table 4gives responses for EQ-5D (proxy-1) and
PedsQL questionnaires. Due to the absence of published
population norms for EQ-5D for children, we cannot
compare how the reported levels of problems relate to
those observed in the general population. However, only
35% of caregivers reported children being in a perfect
health state with caregivers reporting various levels of is-
sues across the 5 dimensions. The established national
norm for the PedsQL of a healthy population is 82.3 (±
15.6) [ 54]. Based on the combined results of all respond-
ing caregivers, the children in the study score at the
lower end of this normal range suggesting that the in-
strument is sensitive to the problems faced by these
children.
By comparison to the EQ-5D-Y (proxy-1), the PedsQL
provides more in-depth information concerning emo-
tional, social and school functioning, all dimensions that
are likely to be affected by social communication
impairments.
(ii) Resource use
Little NHS, Social Services and educational services
use was reported across both trial arms either
through the NHS or privately. Similarly, low levels of
u s ew e r er e p o r t e df o rh o m e -based assistance, volun-
tary services or education and childcare services. The
most widely used resource was special educational
needs coordinator (SENCO) though the mean number
of contacts was still very low: 2 (SD 3.5) in the com-
parator group and less than 1 (SD 0.5) in the E-
PLAYS intervention group.(iii) Intervention delivery: costing exercise
From an NHS perspective, low input is required from
health care professionals to deliver E-PLAYS. We antici-
pate, therefore, the cost to the NHS to be small meaning
if the intervention was effective it would likely represent
good value for money. Schools are not required to pur-
chase or provide any additional resources to facilitate
the delivery of E-PLAYS. There was some time required
to set up the intervention initially in schools and attend
the training. Teaching assistants spent around 10 min
preparing for each session. Schools participating in the
feasibility study were not required to pay for the E-
PLAYS software; however, in a full-scale trial, it is pos-
sible that schools would incur an annual licencing fee of
approximately £50 per school to cover software main-
tenance costs. As with the NHS, costs for schools would
be low.
Estimating the sample size of a future trial to evaluate
the effectiveness of E-PLAYS
The variance of the available TPS scores at baseline,
week 20 and week 40 was 51.3 (95% CI129.3 to 93.9),
49.1 (95% CI130.0 to 80.6) and 47.8 (95% CI123.5 to
93.3), respectively. These suggest a reasonable estimate
of the standard deviation of 7.0 (although the available
data are compatible with values between approximately
4.8 and 9.7). Conditional on the fixed effects, the intra-
cluster correlation for SLT was essentially 0. In order to
be conservative, we assume an intra-cluster correlation
of 0.05 in the following calculation which, together with
a (conservative) estimate of the mean cluster size of 5,
gives an estimated design effect due to clustering of 1.20.
The observed correlations between the baseline TPS
score and the TPS scores at week 20 and week 40 wereTable 3 Collaborative Construction Task; number of codes appearing in each task for each pair of children for the intervention (E-

strong at 0.84 (95% CI20.71 to 0.91) and 0.79 (95% CI2
0.63 to 0.89), respectively. We can account for a more
conservative correlation of 0.6 in our sample size calcu-
lation by multiplying the sample size required for an un-
adjusted analysis by(1 −0.62). Finally, we assume a
conservative rate of attrition of 25%. These parameters
mean that 356 children would be required for 90%power in a two-sided test of size 5%. Assuming an aver-
age of 5 children per SLT, approximately 71 NHS SLTs
would need to be recruited and randomised.
Adverse events and safety
No adverse events were recorded.
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility
of conducting a full-scale randomised controlled trial to
evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the E-
PLAYS intervention when delivered by SLTs and teach-
ing assistants by comparison to usual care for children
with social communication impairments.
To assess feasibility, we examined recruitment of chil-
dren through the Speech and Language Services of the
NHS, the acceptability of E-PLAYS to the children and
teaching assistants using it, methods of determining
intervention fidelity and delivery and the suitability of
outcome measures and cost-effectiveness measures. Im-
portant lessons were learned that will be applied to any
follow-on trial.
Recruitment and retention
Our original target was to recruit 70 children over a
period of 3 months [ 56,71]. We actually recruited 50
children in 3.5 months although the recruitment period
had to be delayed. For a full trial, increasing the number
of children to be recruited could be addressed straight-
forwardly by simply recruiting more NHS trusts to the
study. Although 70 children had been our original target,
there are no set guidelines for participant numbers for
feasibility trials; sample sizes of between 24 and 70 have
been recommended to allow for the reliable estimation
of the standard deviation for use in the sample size cal-
culation of a future fully powered trial [ 56,72] and 50
was in fact sufficient for this purpose. Importantly, our
E-PLAYS intervention has already indicated a signal of
efficacy in pilot studies [ 29,44].
The time period within which to recruit children and
the rate of recruitment are more complex issues as they
are constrained by the necessity of operating within the
school year. We delayed the recruitment period as far as
possible to allow SLTs time to examine their caseloads
and approach schools. Even with this delay, however, we
still did not manage to recruit our target of 70 children.
We were obliged to bring recruitment to a close in order
to begin intervention delivery within the school year. A
major factor causing recruitment delays was that SLTs
often did not know which children were to be on the
caseload until well into the school year. However, for aTable 4 Proportions of reported problems by the trial arm in

full trial, recruitment could be more easily managed in
waves over a 2- or 3-year period; once a school and SLT
are part of the study, children from subsequent school
years can be recruited relatively easily. E-PLAYS was
highly appealing, and thus, schools and SLTs were gen-
erally keen to participate. We recruited 50 children from
a single NHS trust; our sample size calculation suggests
that we would need 356 children and 71 NHS SLTs for
a full trial. This would necessitate the recruitment of
around 6 –7 NHS trusts, which would appear feasible.
An important feasibility question concerned recruit-
ment of the typically developing peer children to partner
the focal children and the willingness of parents to allow
their participation. We found that 100% of parents gave
consent for these children to take part. However, con-
cerns have been expressed elsewhere that this kind of
participation could have negative consequences for
typically-developing children [ 73,74] as it may take up
their own educational time for the benefit of other chil-
dren. Locke et al. ’s (2012) longitudinal study [ 75] did not
report any adverse outcomes for typically developing
children as a result of participating in a peer-mediated
intervention, and the burden of our E-PLAYS interven-
tion is relatively light (4 × 15-min sessions). E-PLAYS
aims to provide a positive educational experience for
typically-developing children as well as those with com-
munication impairments and teaching assistants re-
ported that they enjoyed it just as much.
Retention was satisfactory; 70% retention is considered
the minimum for inclusion in Cochrane Reviews [ 76].
Participant burden on the children did not appear to be
onerous which seems to be borne out by children ’s will-
ingness when approached by research assistants. Teacher
and parent responses were slightly lower than 70% at 40
weeks. Although the questionnaire burden on teachers
was relatively light (15 min per child), we found that this
was a stressed occupational group with high staff turn-
over. As we were relying on schools to pass question-
naires on, this also impacted the response rate from
parents. For a full trial, we will explore possibilities for
incentives for schools. This has worked successfully in
other large-scale school-based NIHR trials.
Acceptability
E-PLAYS was highly acceptable, with SLTs, teaching as-
sistants and children all rating it very positively. It is
likely that this reflects the high level of intervention de-
velopment, testing and stakeholder involvement in the
pilot study that preceded the feasibility study [ 29,44].
The questionnaires to SLTs and teaching assistants
concerning training and the manual elicited favourable
responses, suggesting that we had been able to develop
accessible instruction material. All reported that the
computer game was easy to run. There were few issuesaround acceptability. Feedback overwhelmingly consisted
of requests for a higher standard of graphics and add-
itional games features which will be considered for fu-
ture versions.
A further reason for the popularity of E-PLAYS was
that it had been designed to fit within normal school
and SLT working patterns. Thus, additional staff and re-
sources were not required from schools and NHS SLTs
taking part.
Tolmie et al. (2010) [ 24] found that collaborative work
led to improved student relations. This is a particularly
important consideration for children with special educa-
tional needs who are generally less liked and accepted by
their peers; Pinto et al. (2019) [ 31] found that the level
ofmeaningful interaction with peers was the strongest
predictor of acceptability for these children. Collabora-
tive computer games are generally enjoyable interactions
but also meaningful in this instance as the children in E-
PLAYS are directed and obliged to collaborate to suc-
ceed in the game. It is possible, therefore, that E-PLAYS
may have an impact on children ’s peer relations and this
is one of the measures we propose to include in a future
trial. Teaching assistants reported that sessions with peer
classmates were particularly popular, with most suggest-
ing that these should be increased in number and
duration.
Treatment fidelity and delivery
Should E-PLAYS ultimately become nationally avail-
able and distributed, it is important that SLTs and
teaching assistants can use it autonomously. For max-
imum fidelity, E-PLAYS was web-based and manua-
lised with the content for each session specified step-
by-step. The manual was generally well-liked and ses-
sions were delivered without major problems thereby
showing promise for good fidelity in a national roll-
out. Delays tended to occur around the commence-
ment of the intervention, chiefly due to staff short-
ages. However, once schools began with E-PLAYS,
they were keen to continue.
We were able to gain precise assessment of treatment
delivery through automatic recording by the E-PLAYS
software. This recording was supplemented with live ob-
servations of the teaching assistants delivering E-PLAYS.
These two methods confirmed that delivery was accept-
able in terms of number and length of sessions.
Suitability of outcome measures
Pragmatic language skills are notoriously difficult to
measure; the problem being that they manifest them-
selves only during dynamic social interaction, thus ren-
dering testing with standardised questionnaires largely
unachievable [ 1]. Furthermore, adult (particularly par-
ent) report for conditions relating to autism and socialMurphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 14 of 18
communication are thought to be particularly suscep-
tible to placebo effects [ 77,78]. In spite of this, the ma-
jority of social communication literature is based on
non-blinded parent-, teacher- or clinician-report [ 79]. It
was one of our chief objectives to address this limitation
and use effective measures administered by independent,
blinded outcome assessors. We therefore used the TPS
and CELF-5 subscales administered by research assis-
tants. For consistency with other studies and to provide
more global measures we also included reports from
teachers and parents.
A key outcome of language and communication skill-
learning is measuring subsequent use of the skill in con-
texts other than the one in which it was learned; skills
can fail to generalise to novel contexts. Wieckowski and
White ’s (2017) [ 4] systematic review of technological in-
terventions for social communication impairments re-
ports that this is rarely assessed. To measure
generalisation we included the CCT, previously devised
by the authors.
The suitability of our measures was indicated by the
good response and retention rates. Also, completion of
the measures was excellent with very few missing items;
almost all were analysable (see Fig. 1). Comparison of
scores with norms suggests that these measures will de-
tect changes as a result of intervention in a future full
trial. We were able to preserve blinding for the research
assistant-administered measures and for the CCT to suc-
cessfully train research assistants to high levels of inter-
rater reliability.
Health economic measures and cost-effectiveness
At present, neither of the instruments tested (ED-5D-Y
proxy-1 and PedsQL) can be used to calculate QALYs
that are required for a utility analysis, nor is there an al-
ternative that can be used for this age range. However,
EuroQol are currently looking to establish a value set for
children and this may be available in the near future. On
this basis, we would plan to include both the EQ-5D-Y
proxy-1 and PedsQL in a full trial to ensure the best rep-
resentation of health-related quality of life with the view
of calculating QALYs if possible. Completion rates for
EQ-5D proxy-1 and PedsQl were very similar to each
other but PedsQL provides more information on social
and emotional functioning.
As the feasibility study was conducted with a small
number of participants in a geographically small area,
the low uptake of resources may reflect low levels of
availability within this area. This is at odds with previous
research; health economic evaluations have been called
for in this field as it has been shown that healthcare
costs are 36% higher for children with language disor-
ders aged 4 –5 years [ 80]. In a full-scale trial, we may ob-
serve higher uptake owing to greater availabilityresources at a national level. This would also allow us to
examine the effect of the intervention from a societal
perspective.
Strengths and limitations
The low-cost, computer-based nature of E-PLAYS
makes it highly suitable for national distribution. E-
PLAYS was designed ultimately to be widely shared and
we have used existing, easily updated technology which
is available within the NHS and in primary schools. A
vast number of commercially-available games are tar-
geted at parents of children with autism spectrum disor-
ders and other children with social communication
impairments [ 81]. Reviewers [ 36] of the computer game
literature have urgently called for large-scale studies to
ensure that exploitation of the opportunities available
with these new technologies is founded on a sound
evidence-base to benefit the children to whom they are
marketed.
Particular strengths of this study are that we have in-
cluded independent, blinded measures and also a meas-
ure of generalisation of the skills taught. Through the
use of technology, we were also able measure delivery of
the intervention sessions precisely; other studies have
been obliged to depend on less reliable methods such as
teacher reports and diary methods.
Fidelity was further assessed via direct live observation
of teaching assistants delivering some of the E-PLAYS
sessions. Teaching assistants knew that they were being
observed and this may have impacted on their behaviour
when delivering these particular sessions. Possible alter-
natives could involve video-recording every session and
then selecting random sessions for fidelity assessment.
This would have the advantage that teaching assistants
would not know which sessions were to be observed and
could not alter their behaviour accordingly. However,
this would have considerable resource implications for a
large-scale study requiring either that a research assist-
ant attend every session to record it or that teaching as-
sistants were asked to make all the recordings
themselves. A further drawback would be that teaching
assistants and children would only use E-PLAYS with
constant observation, thereby possibly not reflecting nat-
ural usage of the intervention which could impact on
outcomes. A limitation of our study concerns the demo-
graphic makeup of our sample. Demographics were
taken at the 40-week data collection point thereby prob-
ably resulting in a lower response rate than had we col-
lected this information at baseline. We acknowledge that
this is a shortcoming of our study and that the value of
this data is correspondingly reduced. Responses came
primarily from white British participants with an above-
average level of education; this did not reflect the highly
diverse areas of London in which the study took place.Murphy et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies             (2021) 7:5 Page 15 of 18
However, our finding is consistent with those of Safer-
Lichtenstein et al. ’s systematic review (2019) [ 82] who
report that study samples for children with autism gen-
erally lack diversity, with an overrepresentation of partic-
ipants who are male, White, and from upper-middle
class backgrounds. This is particularly concerning in
view of the fact that children from lower socio-economic
backgrounds are less likely to receive diagnoses and sup-
port from health and education services for autism or
language disorders [ 10,12]. Sample composition is an
important consideration, particularly if we fail to include
groups that are often under-represented. We will explore
means of recruiting a more diverse sample for a future
RCT.
Conclusion
Based on the outcomes of our study, a full-scale trial ap-
pears feasible and warranted to assess the effectiveness
of E-PLAYS for use by the NHS and schools. Partici-
pants in this study (focal children, teaching assistants,
SLTs) enjoyed using E-PLAYS; overall acceptability was
high. Few concerns were reported regarding participa-
tion in a future trial. However, strategies to improve re-
cruitment rate and retention and to recruit a more
diverse sample would need to be adopted. Despite some
limitations, this feasibility study prepares the ground for
one of the first interventions for children with social
communication impairments to harness the potential of
computer technology. A full-scale trial would result in
making a valuable resource available as well as advan-
cing our knowledge of how to design technological in-
terventions tailored for this group of children.
