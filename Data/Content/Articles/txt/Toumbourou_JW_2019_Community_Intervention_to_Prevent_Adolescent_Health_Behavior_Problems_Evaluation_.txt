Objective: A major challenge for health psychologists is to ensure the implementation of evidence-based
interventions to improve population health. To reduce high rates of adolescent alcohol use and relatedhealth problems, trials of the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention process were implemented inAustralia beginning in 2001. The process assists communities to strategically plan and monitor imple-mentation of evidence-based preventative interventions. This article reports an evaluation of the effectsin the first four Australian communities that completed the process. Method: Trends were examined
based on self-report surveys completed by 41,328 adolescents (average age 13.5 years, 51.7% female)across 109 municipal localities between 1999 and 2015. Multilevel modeling compared the 5 localitieswhere the 4 coalitions completed the CTC process with the remaining 104 localities for trends inadolescent reports of lifetime alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use and past year antisocial behavior.Results: Relative to Australian trends, adolescents in CTC localities reported significantly steeper annual
reductions in any lifetime alcohol (Adjusted odds ratio [ AOR]/H110050.94, 95% confidence intervals [CI] /H11005
[0.93, 0.95]), tobacco ( AOR/H110050.97, CI [0.96, 0.99]), cannabis use ( AOR/H110050.96, CI [0.93, 0.98]) and
antisocial behavior (unstandardized regression coefficient [ B]/H11005/H11002 0.001, CI [ /H110020.002, 0.000]). Conclu-
sion: Implementation of the CTC process in Australia was associated with more rapid community
reductions in adolescent health behavior problems. Supporting community coalitions to adopt evidence-based interventions appears a feasible means for health psychologists to improve the health of largeadolescent populations and prevent related chronic health problems in later life.

This article reports an Australian evaluation of a community-
based adolescent health promotion intervention called Communi-ties That Care (CTC). In what follows are details of the interven-tion together with the Australian public health context that framedthe evaluation.
The Imperative to Prevent Adolescent
Health Problems
Recently a Lancet Commission called for priority action to
address adolescent health problems ( Patton et al., 2016 ). This call
to action was based on the large world population that will fall intothe adolescent age period in the coming decades and the potentialfor interventions to markedly improve health in later years. Prioritytargets for adolescent health behavior change include the reductionof alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and related behaviors suchas violence and associated injuries ( Toumbourou, Olsson, Row-
land, Renati, & Hallam, 2014 ). There is substantial evidence that
preventing adolescent health behavior problems can reduce futurepublic health burden related to adult chronic disease and disability(Toumbourou et al., 2014 ).
Alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use are underlying causes of a
wide range of health and social problems and the earlier a personcommences using these substances, the greater their risk of harm(Catalano & Hawkins, 1996 ).
Alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of devel-
oping a range of chronic diseases, is a cause of cancer, and hasbeen linked to high blood pressure and overweight and obesity(Shield, Parry, & Rehm, 2013 ). Adolescent alcohol, tobacco, and
illicit drug use not only increase the immediate risk of healthproblems but also predict adult dependence and related health andsocial problems ( Silins et al., 2015 ), therefore, reducing substance
use during adolescence is important for preventing long-termadverse consequences and for protecting against short-term harms.
Summaries of adolescent health psychology interventions sug-
gest that reducing the cumulative number of risk factors andenhancing protective factors in the family, school, and communityenvironments can reduce adolescent problems including alcohol,tobacco, illicit drug use, and antisocial behavior ( Toumbourou et
al., 2014 ). This knowledge has led to a focus on social environ-
mental intervention strategies as a means of advancing adolescenthealth ( Patton et al., 2006 ).
CTC
CTC was developed in the United States as a framework to
guide community coalitions to design and implement local actionplans to improve child and adolescent health using a science-basedprevention approach ( Hawkins et al., 2008 ). CTC assists in the
formation and training of community coalitions from local agen-cies and volunteers serving child and adolescent health using afive-phase process. These phases provide communities with astandardized structure and benchmarking for intervention imple-mentation, monitoring and evaluation and include: recruitment andorientation of community leaders and stakeholders to the CTCprocess (Phase 1), formation of a local coalition to guide decisionmaking (Phase 2), use of epidemiologic data to prioritize riskfactors to be targeted for preventive action (Phase 3), selection ofappropriate evidence-based intervention programs (Phase 4), andimplementation and monitoring of selected programs (Phase 5). A
lead agency (e.g., a local government council) is required to leadthe community through the phases (see www.communitiesthatcare
.org.au/5-phases-ctc ). Communities are trained in each of the five
phases with trainings delivered by an accredited trainer. Once acommunity completes the five phases, the cycle can be repeated totarget new health promotion priorities.
The process also guides coalitions to use valid and reliable
youth surveys ( Arthur, Hawkins, Pollard, Catalano, & Baglioni,
2002 ) to assess community needs and develop prevention plans
that are tailored to local community priorities ( Hawkins et al.,
2009 ). The behavior change theory guiding the CTC approach is
the social development model (SDM; Catalano & Hawkins, 1996 ).
The SDM integrates a range of health behavior theory, whileemphasizing the importance of social bonding (e.g., with peers oradults) as a critical step leading to socially influenced behavior.The SDM recognizes opportunities, skills and social rewards asmodifiable protective factors that influence social bonding. Coali-tions are encouraged to plan evidence-based interventions to in-crease these protective factors to increase “prosocial bonding” tohealthy role models.
The CTC resources include regularly updated lists of manual-
ized programs that have been evaluated in randomized trials andfound to be effective. The CTC approach encourages implemen-tation of “evidence-based” programs of this type. In the U.S. largecommunity trials reveal the CTC process led to increased commu-nity implementation of evidence-based interventions ( Hawkins et
al., 2008 ). Longitudinal follow-up studies have linked the imple-
mentation of CTC in the United States with increases in protectivefactors and reductions in risk factors for adolescent problems,while also revealing reductions in targeted problems includingalcohol and drug use ( Hawkins et al., 2009 ) and crime ( Greenberg,
Feinberg, Gomez, & Osgood, 2005 ).
The Australian Adolescent Health Context
In the late 1990s in Australia there were rising rates of adolescent
health problems such that in 2002 a cross-national comparison ob-served almost twice the rate of adolescent alcohol and other drug useamong Australian adolescents compared to their same-aged peers inthe US ( McMorris, Hemphill, Toumbourou, Catalano, & Patton,
2007;Toumbourou, Hemphill, McMorris, Catalano, & Patton, 2009 ).
In this context, it was considered important to investigate whetherthere were feasible and effective community-led intervention alterna-tives to reduce adolescent alcohol and drug use. A number of reportsin that period recommended the implementation of CTC as a meansof improving adolescent health ( National Crime Prevention, 1999 ;
Toumbourou, 1999 ).
Findings from the United States suggested that evidence-based
strategies that are coordinated and delivered by communities couldbe effective for implementation in Australia ( Toumbourou, 1999 ).
However, to be supported for wider dissemination, these commu-nity delivered prevention strategies required testing and systematicevaluation in the Australian context.
The Australian Implementation of CTC
The Australian license to implement the CTC process was
purchased from the U.S. developer in 1999 ( Toumbourou, 1999 )This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

and a company was formed to offer the technical assistance and
resources to Australian communities. The Australian implementa-tion of CTC was initiated using the training manuals and technicalresources available in 2002, with the developer providing trainingupdates in later years.
The present project sought to analyze data collected across
Australia over a 15-year period using the Communities That CareYouth Survey (CTC Youth Survey). The CTC Youth Survey wasdesigned in the United States to provide a valid tool for communitymonitoring of risk factors that influence adolescent health behav-iors such as alcohol and drug use ( Arthur et al., 2002 ). The survey
includes a comprehensive range of scales that had been found insystematic reviews of longitudinal studies to be consistent riskfactors for adolescent health behavior problems, while also mon-itoring the protective factors identified by the SDM ( Arthur et al.,
2002 ).
The CTC Youth Survey assesses adolescent alcohol and drug
use behavior using valid questions from the Monitoring The Futuresurvey ( Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2011 ) that
are used internationally in the European School Survey Project onAlcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD: Hibell et al., 2011 ) student
surveys. The CTC Youth survey measures risk and protectivefactors in an ecological context at the individual, peer, family,school, and community levels (e.g., substance use attitudes, attach-ment to family and school, opportunities and rewards for prosocialinvolvement). The Australian adaptation of the CTC Youth Surveywas first trialed as a state-wide student monitoring instrument inthe south-eastern state of Victoria in 1999. The Australian CTCYouth Survey has been prospectively tested in matched longitu-dinal studies in Victoria and in Washington State in the UnitedStates and found to be a valid and reliable longitudinal predictor ofadolescent alcohol and drug use in both states ( Hemphill et al.,
2011 ).
The Present Report
National CTC Youth Survey data was used to evaluate the
behavioral impact of the implementation in the five localitiesserved by the first four Australian CTC coalitions (pioneer com-munities). It was hypothesized that in the municipal localitiesimplementing CTC, community rates of adolescent alcohol andother drug use and related antisocial behavior would reduce moresteeply over time compared to Australian community trends inother localities.
Method
Study Design
The study sought to evaluate the effect of CTC exposure based
on the comparison of Australian population trends ( Toumbourou et
al., 2018 ) in adolescent health behavior. To achieve this, multilevel
analysis was completed on student survey data collected using theAustralian version of the CTC Youth Survey. Data from thepioneer and comparison communities were collected throughcross-sectional school surveys that were designed to estimate theyouth population characteristics within Australian municipal lo-calities (local government areas [LGA]).The student survey data used for the present article has been
described previously ( Toumbourou et al., 2018 ) and is summarized
in what follows. Data were drawn from 11 cross-sectional CTCyouth survey studies. In each survey, schools were selected toprovide valid estimates of the youth population within sampledLGAs. Surveys were conducted in 109 Australian LGAs between1999 and 2015 ( Toumbourou et al., 2018 ).
Procedure
Ethics approval for data collection was obtained from the Royal
Children’s Hospital and University of Melbourne Human ResearchEthics Committees for the surveys completed until 2012 and fromthe Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee for thesurveys completed after 2012. Relevant education authorities andschool principals provided consent. For each of the surveys, allstudents in the selected year levels within the participating schoolswere invited to take part. All surveys were anonymous. The surveyquestions and procedures were matched across years, with studentssupervised by trained research staff to complete questionnairesduring class time of approximately 45 min.
CTC Intervention
The present evaluation focused on the first four Australian
coalitions that completed all five phases of the CTC process. Thefirst three communities (Mornington Peninsula Shire [an outerurban municipality] and Ballarat in Victoria and Bunbury in West-ern Australia [regional towns]) initiated activities from 2001 to2002. Champions from these three municipalities approached CTCfollowing national publicity about the process. All three commu-nities were able to successfully raise state-government funding tocomplete the process. An independent process evaluation reportedthese communities successfully completed all five phases of theCTC process in one or more locations within their community(Kellock, 2007 ). After completing their first five-phase cycle (in
2007), CTC Mornington Peninsula were supported by their localgovernment to complete a further two cycles of the process. TheBunbury coalition completed their first cycle in 2006. Althoughthey have not implemented a further CTC cycle, they have re-mained active as a regional child and adolescent health coalitionand as of 2018 were continuing to implement evidence-basedpractices in early childhood populations ( www.investinginouryouth
.com.au/ ). The Ballarat coalition (Strengthening Generations)
completed their first cycle in 2009. From 2009, the Ballarat coali-tion continued to use knowledge gained from the CTC process toimplement adolescent alcohol prevention services supported bylocal government until 2014, when local priorities changed. Thefourth pioneer community (CTC Myrtleford) was the first smalltown to implement the process. Champions from a local healthservice approached CTC following publicity of positive findingsfrom the initial pioneer sites. Beginning in 2009, their first cyclewas completed in 2015, funded from community health and othercontributions. Having achieved significant reductions in adoles-cent problems in their first cycle, the Myrtleford coalition havesince expanded to a LGA (CTC Alpine) and as of 2018 wereactively implementing a second cycle of the CTC process.

tralia are regularly updated by the Australian Research Alliance forThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Children and Youth, Prevention Science Network and listed on a
searchable website ( http://whatworksforkids.org.au ). As relevant
to adolescents, the initially developed action plans in all fourcommunities have focused on the prevention of adolescent alcoholuse (and in three communities other drug use was also targeted).All action plans focused on reducing favorable attitudes to alcoholand drugs in youth using school-based drug education (e.g., SchoolHealth and Alcohol Harm Reduction Project; McBride, Far-
ringdon, & Kennedy, 2007 ) and on reducing family risk factors
using evidence-based parent education and family intervention(e.g., Triple P; Sanders, Kirby, Tellegen, & Day, 2014 ). Evalua-
tions confirmed the majority of the strategies listed in the actionplans were successfully implemented ( Kellock, 2007 ).
Measures
Lifetime substance use was measured in the CTC youth survey
as follows: (a) alcohol use: “In your lifetime on how many occa-sions (if any) have you: Had alcoholic beverages (like beer, wineor liquor/spirits) to drink—more than just a few sips?” Responseoptions ranged from never toten or more times and were recoded
as categorical outcomes 0 ( never )a n d1( one or more times ); (b)
tobacco use: “Have you ever smoked cigarettes?”; and (c) cannabisuse: “In your lifetime on how many occasions (if any) have yo u...
used marijuana (pot, weed, grass)?.” Response options rangedfrom never toten or more times and were recoded as categorical
outcomes 0 ( never )a n d1( one or more times ).
Antisocial behavior was measured as follows: antisocial behav-
ior: five items (How many times in the past year [12 months] haveyou: carried a weapon? sold illegal drugs? stolen or tried to steala motor vehicle such as a car or motorcycle? attacked someonewith the idea of seriously hurting them? been drunk or high atschool?) Response options ranged from never toten or more times
(Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.62) and were recoded as 0 ( never )a n d1( one
or more times ). The scale comprised the count across the five items
averaged to range from 0 to 1.
A risk factor average score was calculated as the mean (scaled
1 to 4) of the following eight CTC Youth Survey risk factors:
For community substance abuse, there were four items (e.g.,
How easy would it be for yo u...i fy o u wanted to get som e...
cigarettes? alcoho l... ? marijuan a... ?a drug like cocaine, heroin
. . .?) had response options ranging from 1 ( very hard )t o4( very
easy; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.87). For low community attachment,
three items (I’d like to get out of my neighborhood. If I had tomove, I would miss the neighborhood I now live in [reverse coded,R]. I like my neighborhood [R]) had response options ranging from1(NO!)t o4( YES! ; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.77). For parent favorable
attitudes to substance use, four items (How wrong do your parentsfeel it would be for you to: smoke cigarettes? drink beer or wineregularl y... ? drink liquor/spirits regularl y... ?u s e marijuana
. . .?) had response options ranging from 1 ( very wrong )t o4( not
wrong at all ; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.81). For poor family manage-
ment, nine items (My parents ask if I’ve gotten my homeworkdone? . . . parents know if you did not come home on time? The
rules in my family are clear? When I am not at home, one of myparents knows where I am and who I am with? My parents wantme to call if I am going to be late getting home? My family hasclear rules about alcohol and drug use? ;... would you be caught
by your parent s...i f you: drank some alcoho l... ?... carried aweapo n... ?... skipped schoo l . . .?) had response options ranging
from 1 ( YES! )t o4( NO!; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.83). For family
conflict, three items ( ...I nm y famil
y...W e argue about the same
thing s... over and over? Peopl e... have serious arguments ?...
often insult or yell at each other?) had response options rangingfrom 1 ( NO!)t o4( YES! ; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.80). For low
commitment to school, seven items (During the last four week s...
how many whole days have you missed because you skipped or“cut/wagged” [R]? How often do you feel that the schoolwork youare assigned is meaningful and important? How interesting aremost of your school subjects to you ?...t h e things you are learning
in school are going to be [important] for your later life? ;... over
the past yea r...h o w often did yo u... Enjoy being in school? Hate
being in school [R]? Try to do your best work in school?) hadresponse options ranging from 1 ( almost always )t o4( never ;
Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.80). For academic failure, two items (. . .
what were your grades/marks like last year?—response optionsranged from 1 [ very good ]t o4[ very poor ]; Are your school grades
better than the grades/marks of most students in your class?—response options ranged from 1 [ YES! ]t o4[ NO!]; Cronbach’s
alpha/H11005.68). For perceived substance use, four items (How much
do you think people risk harming themselves (physically or inother ways) if they :... smok e... cigarette s... ? T a k e...a n
alcoholic beverag e... nearly every day? use marijuan a... once
or twice? regularly?) had response options that ranged from 1(great risk )t o4( no risk ; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.85). The risk factor
average score aggregated from the eight risk factors had a meanscore/H110051.87 (95% CI [1.83, 1.91]; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.72).
A protective factor average score was calculated as the mean
(scaled 1 to 4) of the following seven CTC Youth Survey protec-tive factors:
For community opportunities for prosocial involvement, there
were five items (Which of the following activities for people yourage are available in your community? Sports teams; Scoutin g... ;
Youth group s... ; Community servic e... ; There are lots of adults
in my neighborhood I could talk to about something important)had response options for all the protective factors ranged from 1(NO!)t o4( YES! ; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.72). For family attachment,
there were four items (Do you feel very close to your mother ?...
father? Do you share your thoughts and feelings with your mother?. . . father?; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.79). For family opportunities for
prosocial involvement, there were three items (My parent s... give
me lots of chances to do fun things with them ?...a s km e what

could as k...f o r help; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.74). For family
rewards for prosocial involvement, there were four items (Myparent s... notice when I am doing a good jo b... tell you they’re

. . . father?; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.77). For school opportunities for
prosocial involvement, there were five items (In my school, stu-dents have lots of chances to help decide thing s... Teachers ask

(I know how to relax when I feel tens e... keep my feelings under

score derived from the seven protective factors had a meanscore/H110053.02 (CI [2.99, 3.04]; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.77).
To provide additional control for peer, family and community
contextual factors student reports were also included based on thefollowing scales. For peer substance use, there were four items (Inthe past year (12 months), how many of your best friends have:smoked cigarettes? tried alcoho l... ? used marijuan a... ? used
other illegal drug s . . .?). Response options ranged from 1 ( no
friends )t o5( four or more friends ; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.80). For
parent antisocial attitudes, three items (How wrong do your parentsfeel it would be for you to: steal something worth more than$5/10? draw graffiti, or write things or draw pictures on buildingsor other property (without the owner’s permission)? pick a fightwith someone?) had response options ranging from 1 ( very wrong )
t o4( not wrong at all ; Cronbach’s alpha /H11005.77). For community
mobility, four items (Have you changed homes in the past year?Have you changed schools ...i nt h e past year? How many times
have you changed school s... since kindergarten? How many
times have you changed homes since kindergarten?) had responseoptions that ranged from 1 ( never )t o5( 7 or more times ; Cron-
bach’s alpha /H11005.60).
Demographic details were recorded based on student reports of
gender, age, school grade, Non-Australian country of birth (refer-ent Australian birth and missing), and Indigenous status (referentnon-Indigenous and missing). Community, state, urban/non-urbanregion and government (referent Catholic, independent, or miss-ing) school were coded based on the student school type andlocation. The survey response rate (percentage of students sur-veyed from the school population in each LGA: range 50% to90%, mean 73%) was included in analyses. Community disadvan-tage was assigned based on 2011 census data (Index of RelativeSocioeconomic Disadvantage; Australian Bureau of Statistics,
2011 ) for each LGA. A variable representing the survey year that
students completed questionnaires was developed with each unitrepresenting the increment of one year (i.e., 1 /H110051999; 3 /H110052001;
17/H110052015).
Analyses
All analyses were completed using Stata, Version 15. Multilevel
modeling was conducted using STATA procedure “mixed” forcontinuous outcomes and “melogit” for categorical. First, lineartrends for four adolescent health behavior problems were esti-mated based on the odds ratio for the effect of survey yearadjusting for gender, school grade, urban location, governmentschool, survey response rate, community disadvantage, child coun-try of birth, Indigenous status, peer substance use, family antisocialattitudes, and community mobility. All estimates controlled for theclustering of students within LGAs. Second to enable hypothesistesting, the predictive effect of the student location in a CTC sitewas evaluated based on the interaction with the survey year annualtrend estimate. The four CTC coalitions implemented in fivelocalities and trends in these sites were compared to the remaining104 localities. Finally, the STATA “margins” command was usedto obtain adjusted prevalence estimates for adolescent behaviorsand risk factors from the multivariate models that were plotted
graphically.
To maximize the analytic sample, missing data was included in
the referent for three variables (government school [not recordedon 14,994 surveys], child country of birth [12,403 missing values],Indigenous status [11,431 missing values]) and imputed usingregression from correlated variables in three cases (gender [1,034missing values imputed], peer substance use [1,252 values], familyantisocial attitudes [2,619], and community mobility [3,978]). Themultivariate analyses in the imputed data were compared with asample of nonimputed data in analyses that did not include thehigh missing variables—government school, child country of birthand Indigenous status. In overview the models were similar withimputed and nonimputed data and hence the imputed data wereretained in the analyses.
Results
Participants
Youth surveys were completed by 41,328 adolescents ( Mage/H11005
13.5 years; SD/H110051.7;Mgrade/H110058; 51.7% female). Table 1 presents
other demographic information for the samples surveyed in thecomparison and the CTC intervention communities. There were nosignificant differences except for Australian birth, parent antisocialattitudes, and community mobility where rates were significantlyhigher in the intervention communities.
Table 2 presents details of the multilevel models predicting
adolescent substance use behaviors, adjusted for demographic andsocioeconomic factors. Table 2 revealed that the multivariate ad-
justed odds ratio ( OR) for the survey year showed a linear trend for
annual reductions in community rates of the three behaviors acrossthe 15 years. The largest reduction was for tobacco use ( OR/H11005
0.86, confidence interval [CI]: [0.85, 0.87]) and the lowest was foralcohol use ( OR/H110050.96, CI [0.95, 0.97]). The CTC sites had
significantly higher rates of alcohol and cannabis use at the base-line in 1999 (e.g., alcohol use OR1.88). The interaction (CTC
Sites/H11003Survey Year) revealed significantly higher annual reduc-
tions in the CTC sites compared to other Australian localities inadolescent substance use behavior, with the largest reductions foralcohol use ( OR/H110050.94).
Multivariate adjusted estimates from these models revealed that
the prevalence of any lifetime alcohol use in average Grade 8 in1999 was significantly higher for students in the CTC sites (74%,CI [71, 77]%) compared to other Australian communities (64%, CI[62, 65]%). The reduction in Grade 8 alcohol use was steeper inthe CTC sites, such that in 2015 alcohol use was lower (46%, CI[43, 49]%) compared to the other Australian localities (52%, CI[50, 53]%). These trends are presented in Figure 1 .
Table 3 presents multivariate regression analyses predicting
youth-report of the number of antisocial behaviors and risk andprotective factors. The interaction term (CTC Sites /H11003Survey Year)
was significant revealing larger annual changes in the CTC sitescompared to other Australian communities for reduction of antisocialbehavior (unstandardized regression coefficient [ B]/H11005/H11002 0.001, CI
[/H110020.002,/H110020.000]), risk factors ( B/H11005/H110020.007, CI [ /H110020.008,/H110020.005])
and increased protective factors ( B/H110050.007, CI [0.005, 0.010]).
Although protective factors increased in the CTC sites, a decliningThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

trend was observed over the 15-years in other Australian communities
(survey year B/H11005/H110020.006: see Figure 1 ).
Discussion
The hypothesis that exposure to the CTC intervention would be
associated with steeper declines in adolescent alcohol, tobacco,and cannabis use and antisocial behavior was supported. The CTC
intervention was also associated with steeper reductions in adoles-cent risk factors and larger increases in protective factors.
The current findings are in line with previous reports of out-
comes following the implementation of the CTC process. Al-though previous evaluations have been mostly limited to theTable 1

United States, the significant effects observed in the present eval-
uation are in line with those from previous evaluations ( Greenberg
et al., 2005 ;Hawkins et al., 2009 ).
The present findings confirm prior studies ( Livingston, 2014 )i n
observing reductions in a range of Australian adolescent healthproblems in recent decades. Toumbourou et al. (2018) used the
present dataset to identify the major factors that may explain theobserved reductions and noted less favorable parent attitudes toalcohol and drug use and a reduced community availability ofalcohol as two pivotal changes. These changes have been in partdue to the increased implementation of evidence-based practicessuch as effective parent education ( Toumbourou, Gregg, Shortt,Hutchinson, & Slaviero, 2013 ) and community monitoring of
alcohol and tobacco sales ( Rowland et al., 2013 ).
The present study is also one of few to document trend reduc-
tions in antisocial behavior and risk factors and is the first to reporta national decline in Australian adolescent protective factors. Thestudy implications are discussed below after consideration of thestudy strengths and limitations.
Strengths and Limitations
Important strengths of the present study include the large school
samples surveyed within communities using a common instrument

over a 15-year period and the use of multilevel modeling. The
study design enabled a unique evaluation of the national dissem-ination of an intervention shown to be effective in the U.S. context.Important limitations of the study were that community recruit-ment was not randomized but was based on direct approaches fromcommunity champions working in localities with high-levels ofadolescent health problems. Hence, the possibility cannot be ruledout that the effects may have been partly explained by the effortsof the motivated community leaders rather than the CTC processper se. A randomized trial is currently underway in Australia toexamine whether similar effects are achievable when communitiesare randomly approached. The nonrandomized evaluation designhas the benefit of external validity, given that in the real worldsetting motivated leaders are typically the group that seek toimplement the CTC process.
A potential design limitation of the present study was that data
were based exclusively on self-reports of volunteering studentsrecruited in cross-sectional school-based samples. Toumbourou et
al. (2018) noted the reported rates of adolescent substance use
were equivalent to those reported using different survey methods.
The current report is limited in providing only an aggregate
finding across the pioneer communities. The CTC localities variedin their size, urban-regional character, and start and finish dates forthe CTC process and programs that were implemented. Althoughanalyses for the six outcomes listed in Tables 2 and 3noted
significant community heterogeneity, due to small samples insome communities, our study was underpowered to permit a de-tailed comparison of the four CTC coalition sites. However, wewere able to test the effects of community heterogeneity by com-pleting a sensitivity analysis comparing two subsamples that di-verged in levels of community disadvantage. These comparisonssuggested that our reported findings were generally robust tocommunity heterogeneity, with the exception of antisocial behav-ior where CTC effects were smaller in the less disadvantagedLGAs. Table 3 revealed that antisocial behavior varied according
to socioeconomic disadvantage. The CTC process may be poorlytargeted to effect reductions in communities that have low rates ofantisocial behavior.
A further limitation may arise due to the argument that the study
is an internal evaluation, given many of the coauthor team servedin the Australian company established to implement CTC. To theextent that the coauthors did not originate the CTC process, butwere required to hold research credentials to manage the process,the study represents as close to an independent evaluation of CTCas appears possible given the nature of this complex intervention.
Implications and Contribution
The current study is the first to evaluate the CTC process in the
Australian context and hence broadens the range of evidence-based adolescent prevention strategies available for implementa-tion within the international context. The findings support thepotential to improve health using community-led interventions, inline with ecological health promotion theories ( Patton et al., 2006 ).
An important finding noted in the present study is the decline in
adolescent protective factors that occurred across Australia from1999 to 2015. This decline may relate to observations of decreas-ing youth social capital indicated by increased: family breakdownand child neglect and abuse, school suspensions and exclusion, andwidening socioeconomic inequality ( Toumbourou et al., 2015 ).
Between 1999 and 2015 Australian students reported increases infamily conflict, school academic failure, community disorganiza-tion, and community transitions and mobility ( Toumbourou et al.,
2018 ). The emphasis within the CTC process on community in-
terventions to increase the SDM prosocial bonding constructs(Catalano & Hawkins, 1996 ) may explain why protective factors
increased differentially in the CTC sites. Thus, an important im-plication arising from the current report is the feasibility of usingcommunity coalition models to enhance social capital as a meansof contributing to public health.
The current findings are compatible with the implication that the
CTC process can contribute to public health in adolescent popu-lations. This is important for preventing chronic health conditionsin later life as well as protecting against short-term harms.
To be implemented effectively within a national context the
CTC process requires a long-time commitment and a highly skilledresearch team. The benefits of this commitment are the potential toimprove health outcomes across very large adolescent populations,while also building national prevention expertise. U.S. studiesdemonstrate the process to be cost-effective ( Kuklinski, Fagan,
Hawkins, Briney, & Catalano, 2015 ). Outcome estimates from the
present study can now be used to evaluate cost effectiveness inAustralia.
