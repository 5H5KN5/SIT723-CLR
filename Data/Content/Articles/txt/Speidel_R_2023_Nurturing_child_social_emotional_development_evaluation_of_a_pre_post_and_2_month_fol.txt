Abstract 
Background Social‑ emotional capacities contribute to children’s mental health by helping them navigate their own 
and others’ emotional states and forge healthy relationships. Caregivers and educators are critical socialization agents 
in early and middle childhood, but gaps remain in the systematic integration of social‑ emotional research into car ‑
egiver and educator trainings. The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a social‑
emotional training designed to promote caregivers’ and educators’ capacities to support social‑ emotional develop ‑
ment in children ages 3–8 years.
Methods Fifty adults (n = 24 caregivers of children ages 3–8 years, n = 26 educators working with children ages 
3–8 years) participated in a virtual training over 3 weeks. Participants completed pre ‑training, post ‑training, 
and 2‑month follow‑up questionnaires evaluating their knowledge of social‑ emotional concepts, use of training strat ‑
egies, mental health, and satisfaction with the training. Caregivers also reported children’s social‑ emotional capacities 
and mental health.
Results On average, caregivers and educators completed 83% of the virtual training sessions and reported high 
satisfaction with the training. Further, preliminary evidence indicated that caregivers’ and educators’ knowledge 
of social‑ emotional concepts increased pre ‑ to post ‑training and was maintained at the 2‑month follow‑up. Increases 
in caregivers’ and educators’ knowledge and greater use of training strategies were associated with improvements 
in children’s social‑ emotional capacities and caregivers’ and educators’ own mental health.
Conclusions These pilot results support the feasibility of infusing evidence ‑based social‑ emotional content into car ‑
egiver and educator training initiatives aimed at nurturing child social‑ emotional development and mental health. 
The results inform future evaluation of the short ‑ and long‑term benefits of this training with a full‑scale randomized 
controlled trial design.

satisfaction, perceptions of improved learning, and 
an intent to use strategies from a brief, virtual social-
emotional training?
– Will the training provide preliminary evidence of 
increasing caregivers’ and educators’ knowledge of 
theory-based social-emotional concepts and their 
application of this knowledge through strategies in 
their care for children?
– Will the training provide preliminary evidence that 
it supports child social-emotional and mental health 
outcomes and caregivers’ and educators’ own mental 
health outcomes?
• What are the key feasibility findings?
– On average, caregivers and educators completed 83% 
of training sessions. Further, 95% of caregivers and 
100% of educators reported being satisfied with the 
training, suggesting high uptake and satisfaction.
– Caregivers’ and educators’ knowledge of social-
emotional content increased from pre- to post-
training and these increases were maintained at 
2-month follow-up. Further, caregivers and educa -
tors reported high use of training-based strategies 
at post-training as their mean scores were between 
the anchor points of often and very often.
– Increases in caregiver and educator knowledge and 
higher use of training strategies were associated 
with improvements in key child social-emotional 
and caregiver and educator mental health out -
comes.
• What are the implications of the feasibility findings 
for the design of the main study?
– Findings provide preliminary support for the fea -
sibility of infusing social-emotional content into 
training initiatives for caregivers and educators.
– The preliminary results can be applied to inform 
future full-scale evaluation of the current training 
with a randomized controlled trial design.
– The preliminary results emphasize the importance 
of evaluating practical use of training strategies 
alongside knowledge increases when considering 
potential mechanisms that may explain the effects 
on this training on child, caregiver, and educator 
outcomes.
Background
Across the globe, an estimated 13–20% of children and 
adolescents experience some form of mental disorder 
[e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder; [1, 2]. These estimates 
have jumped during the COVID-19 pandemic, escalat -
ing already concerning levels of mental health challenges 
to crisis levels. For example, pre-pandemic estimates of 
depression and anxiety in children and adolescents were 
1–3 and 7–9%, respectively [1, 2], while recent meta-
analytic evidence collected during COVID-19 estimates 
their prevalence to be as high as 25 and 21%, respectively 
[3]. Supporting positive mental health outcomes from 
an early age is a public health priority because an esti -
mated 50% of adult mental health challenges have their 
onset before age 18 [4]. Early mental health challenges 
often set the stage for short- and long-term challenges in 
other domains of functioning, including academic, psy -
chosocial, occupational, and physical health outcomes 
[5]. Therefore, many researchers in fields spanning devel -
opmental psychology, clinical psychology, social work, 
education, and public health focus on identifying early 
antecedents of poor and positive mental health to inform 
mental health promotion initiatives.
One well-founded antecedent and protective domain 
is social-emotional development. Early social-emotional 
skills set the foundation for mental health and are sus -
ceptible to early socialization practices [6, 7], making 
them a prime focus for mental health interventions. Fur -
ther, children’s social and emotional capacities undergo 
rapid development across early childhood and caregivers 
(e.g., parents) and early childhood educators (e.g., teach -
ers, service providers, and practitioners in child care and 
early years centers) shape and cultivate children’s early 
environments [8], making these ideal contexts for early 
intervention and prevention efforts targeting social-emo -
tional capacities. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility 
of a pilot virtual training designed to bolster caregivers’ 
and educators’ capacities to support children’s social-
emotional capacities and mental health.
Social‑emotional capacities as building blocks of mental 
health
Social-emotional capacities are the range of skills that 
enable children to manage their emotions, connect with 
and care for others, and understand and reflect upon 
how they relate to others and the world around them 
[8]. Decades of theory and research situate social-emo -
tional capacities as important precursors and indicators 
of mental health because early mental health challenges 
often stem from challenges in the social-emotional 
domain [e.g., difficulties establishing emotional auton -
omy and peer relationships; [6, 7]. It is theorized that the 
process of social-emotional development occurs over 
time through three core social-emotional components: 
emotion regulation, other-oriented social-emotional pro -
cesses (e.g., empathy), and self-oriented social-emotional 
Page 3 of 20
 Speidel et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:148 
 
processes (e.g., self-care) [7, 9]. As children’s social envi -
ronments grow more complex throughout early and mid -
dle childhood, their ability to proficiently navigate their 
own and others’ emotions in a manner that balances their 
other-oriented (or interindividual) responsibilities with 
their self-oriented needs and desires is thought to have 
implications for their relationships and mental health 
[e.g., likelihood of disruptive behavior disorders, anxie -
ties and emotional symptoms, and pediatric depression; 
[6, 7, 9]. Empirical work corroborates this theorizing as 
links have been established between each core social-
emotional component and mental health outcomes, such 
as lowered risk for internalizing and externalizing chal -
lenges and higher propensity for prosociality [5, 10]. 
Hence, the framework of this pilot training focuses on 
emotion regulation, other-oriented, and self-oriented 
processes of social-emotional development.
Emotion regulation is the ability to control the occur -
rence, intensity, and expression of one’s emotions and 
associated behaviors in order to achieve goals and behave 
appropriately in one’s environment [11]. Emotion regula -
tion develops rapidly during the early years as it increas -
ingly shifts from an externally guided process (i.e., 
facilitated by caregivers and other sensitive adults) to an 
internally guided process (i.e., self-regulation) alongside 
rapid advancements in cognitive and language develop -
ment [12]. Emotion regulation is a central social-emo -
tional process because it promotes children’s abilities to 
cope with challenging emotions and situations across dif -
ferent settings in a flexible manner, and it enables chil -
dren to engage in their world with greater attention and 
emotional maturity [13]. Further, emotion regulation 
is a robust indicator of mental health and adjustment, 
including greater emotional and behavioral well-being, 
and emotion regulation challenges are central to differ -
ent psychopathologies, such as conduct disorders and 
depression [14]. Thus, supporting children’s emotion reg -
ulation can provide a foundation for positive functioning 
across multiple domains.
Other-oriented social-emotional processes reflect how 
children relate to others [9]. One central other-oriented 
social-emotional process is empathy, or the ability to 
feel with others [15]. Specifically, empathy occurs when 
one feels an emotion that is similar to or the same as 
another’s emotion. Related to empathy, sympathy is the 
other-oriented capacity to feel concern for others in dis -
tress, but it does not necessarily require feeling the same 
emotion as the other [16]. Consistent with past literature 
in this area, we use empathy as an umbrella term to cap -
ture both empathy and sympathy as related processes 
[15]. Empathy has an emotional component and a cogni -
tive component that develop in infancy and early child -
hood, respectively [17]. Empathy’s emotional component involves emotion sharing, but does not require under -
standing the source or cause of others’ emotions. The 
cognitive component involves the capacity to under -
stand and evaluate others’ perspectives and emotions 
as distinct from one’s own. When children feel empathy 
for others, it is theorized to orient them to the needs 
and desires of others, thereby helping them establish 
and maintain positive social interactions [18]. Indeed, 
empathy has been empirically linked to lower aggression, 
greater prosociality, and more positive relationships, all 
of which have been linked to, or identified as features of 
better mental health [19, 20]. Thus, cultivating children’s 
other-oriented social-emotional capacities is another 
important step toward nurturing their mental health 
across multiple domains.
Self-oriented social-emotional processes are related to 
how children perceive themselves in relation to others 
or how they treat others. One prototypical self-oriented 
social-emotional process is sadness over wrongdoing 
(i.e., healthy guilt), or feelings of regret after committing 
a transgression [15]. Sadness over wrongdoing requires 
the ability to engage in self-reflection and self-evaluation 
in relation to ethical standards or rules of behavior [15]. 
It develops swiftly through the early childhood years and 
is theorized to help children react in a constructive way 
when they have committed a transgression, such as by 
repairing the damage caused [17]. Self-oriented social-
emotional skills more generally include children’s ability 
to understand their own strengths and limitations (an 
early form of self-reflection), which is thought to facili -
tate self-care and their personal and interpersonal growth 
[15]. Thus, self-oriented social-emotional capacities are 
another important piece of the puzzle comprising healthy 
social-emotional functioning.
Thus, building children’s core social-emotional capaci -
ties is thought to help them form stronger, more mean -
ingful relationships while also supporting their personal 
understanding and gentleness with their own internal 
processes and emotional challenges (i.e., their capacity 
to help themselves in the service of helping others) [21, 
22]. Adopting this perspective, the current pilot training 
aimed to improve caregivers’ and educators’ research-
based knowledge of social-emotional development while 
also supporting their ability to nurture social-emotional 
capacities and mental health in children and themselves.
The role of caregivers and educators in children’s 
social‑emotional development
Social-emotional capacities have biological and genetic 
components and are also subject to early environmen -
tal influences. From an attachment theory perspective, 
the sensitivity of early caregiver–child relationships 
shapes children’s working scripts of relationships and 
Page 4 of 20 Speidel et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:148 
their understanding of appropriate and inappropri -
ate cognitions, behaviors, and motivations for behav -
ior [23]. Warmth, sensitivity, and structure in early 
caregiver–child relationships have been positively linked 
with children’s emotion regulation, empathy, and men -
tal health [24, 25]. Beyond the early caregiver–child 
relationship, ecological systems theory and relational-
developmental systems of care approaches argue that 
children develop in a nested web of environments—the 
home, school, broader community, and beyond—all of 
which interweave and bring in outside actors that influ -
ence child development [26, 27]. For example, positive 
educator–child interactions and school climate have 
been linked with greater child social-emotional capaci -
ties and reduced problem behaviors [28]. Thus, target -
ing change at multiple levels of children’s environmental 
systems through caregivers and educators may increase 
the breadth of training impacts on children’s social-emo -
tional development and mental health.
Existing approaches to support children’s social‑emotional 
capacities
Given the established links between social-emotional 
capacities and positive mental health and given caregiv -
ers’ and educators’ roles in nurturing these capacities, 
prevention and intervention efforts often target social-
emotional capacities as an avenue for supporting child 
mental health [29]. Such initiatives—often called social 
and emotional learning (SEL) programs—have been 
shown to effectively promote children’s mental health 
and prosociality, even several years after program imple -
mentation and especially when they are implemented in 
early childhood [for meta-analytic evidence, see [30–32].
There have been sweeping efforts to incorporate social-
emotional content into school curricula in efforts to 
support children’s social-emotional development [33]. 
For example, by 2020, all 50 US states had adopted pre -
school SEL learning standards and 18 states had K–12 
SEL learning standards [34]—a pattern of social-emo -
tional educational reform that has repeated globally [33]. 
Despite these progressions, gaps remain in the effective 
integration of social-emotional content into educational 
settings. First, there are limitations in the application 
of cutting-edge social-emotional theory and research 
into practice [9, 35]. There is a notable dearth of social-
emotional content in educators’ professional develop -
ment opportunities [33]. For example, a scan of 3916 
courses in US college education programs revealed that 
only 6% included content on emotion regulation or self-
management, 2% included content on other-oriented 
social-emotional processes, and 1% included content 
on self-oriented social-emotional processes [36]. Cor -
roborating this gap, educators report receiving limited training and limited confidence in their ability to sup -
port SEL in a sustainable manner [37, 38]. This trend is 
concerning given the above-noted increases in mandated 
SEL curricular components. Similar limitations are pre -
sent—if not more exacerbated—in early childhood edu -
cation settings outside of schools, such as in child care 
and service settings where professional qualifications 
and curricula tend to vary more widely [39]. Thus, sup -
porting a diverse array of early childhood educators with 
research-based knowledge and application of social-
emotional capacities is a logical first step to reducing the 
most pressing research–practice gaps in this area.
There are even fewer training opportunities for caregiv -
ers. However, early parenting interventions have been 
shown to improve parenting factors, such as attachment, 
parental warmth, sensitivity, and positive discipline, 
which in turn support child social-emotional develop -
ment and mental health [40–42]. There are growing calls 
to include caregivers in efforts to support child social-
emotional development [42] and recommendations for 
scaling up SEL programming often advocate for caregiver 
components so that social-emotional improvements 
in early learning environments, such as daycares and 
schools, can be supplemented and extended by social-
emotional support at home [43].
Finally, growing evidence suggests that it may not be 
enough to increase caregivers’ and educators’ knowl -
edge of children’s social-emotional development; rather, 
supporting caregivers’ and educators’ own capacities—
especially their mental health—can improve the efficacy 
of provider-focused efforts to support child develop -
ment [44]. From this perspective, social-emotional train -
ing initiatives may benefit from supporting caregivers’ 
and educators’ own emotion regulation, other-oriented 
social-emotional processes, self-oriented social-emo -
tional processes, and mental health. Current SEL promo -
tion initiatives in schools are often limited in scope and 
fail to incorporate broader systems-level practices that 
nurture all parties involved in children’s caring environ -
ments [45]. This gap is particularly stark for caregivers 
and educators, as these providers are often balancing 
their own and others’ needs in high-stress environments, 
which can contribute to mental health challenges in 
themselves that spillover into challenges in providing 
appropriate care for children [46, 47]. Further, in the 
context of COVID-19, early childhood educators are at 
elevated risk for compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic 
stress, and burnout [48], which can negatively impact 
their ability to provide sensitive care. Hence, expert rec -
ommendations in the wake of COVID-19 advocate for 
initiatives aimed at reducing caregiver and educator 
stress and supporting mental health and self-compassion 
[49].

The present training
This pilot study integrates social-emotional research 
into a brief virtual training for caregivers and educa -
tors of children ages 3 to 8. The goal of the pilot study 
was to evaluate the feasibility of a brief, virtual training 
approach, with the ultimate aim of informing the future 
implementation of a large-scale training within a ran -
domized controlled trial design that aims to increase 
caregivers’ and educators’ knowledge of children’s social-
emotional development, positive early relationships, 
and coping with stress, as well as their capacity to sup -
port their own and children’s social-emotional develop -
ment and mental health. The pedagogical approach for 
the training focuses on knowledge, practice, and routine 
to align with three core principles of adult learning: (1) 
Caregiver and educators have existing competencies that 
can be bolstered with research-based knowledge [50]; (2) 
Learning is an active and collaborative practice (rather 
than passive and isolated [51]; and (3) Learning is con -
tinuous and is flexibly reshaped through routine and 
reflective practice [52]. The knowledge component of 
our pedagogical approach cuts across all elements of the 
training by supporting caregivers and educators with evi -
dence-based clinical–developmental knowledge of social-
emotional development that builds upon experiences 
and existing competencies. The practice component is 
supported through the use of hands-on opportunities to 
apply concepts and share lived experiences in an interac -
tive setting. Finally, the routine component is nurtured 
through the provision of continued learning opportuni -
ties designed to offer continued support and to under -
stand strengths and barriers to sustained learning (see 
“Methods ” for detailed information on the training deliv -
ery and content).
Research questions
To evaluate feasibility in the present proof-of-concept 
study, our research questions were the following: (1) Will 
the training show high acceptability, with caregivers and 
educators showing high uptake (i.e., retention), satisfac -
tion, perceptions of enhanced learning, and intent to use 
strategies from the brief, virtual social-emotional train -
ing? (2) Will preliminary evidence suggest that caregiv -
ers and educators increase in their knowledge of core 
social-emotional concepts, and will they report high 
use of training strategies? *3) Will increases in caregiver 
knowledge and higher use of training strategies by car -
egivers be associated with increases in their children’s 
social-emotional capacities and mental health? (4) Will 
increases in caregivers’ and educators’ knowledge and 
their higher use of training strategies be associated with 
improvements in their own mental health?Methods
Participants
Fifty caregivers (n = 24) and early childhood educa -
tors (n = 26) participated in the training. Caregivers and 
educators were recruited through various early years 
and child care sector organizations who served as com -
munity partners on the current project. Specifically, our 
partners disseminated flyers and social-media posts and 
shared the opportunity via word of mouth at their pro -
gramming sites in [masked for review] region in [masked 
for review], Canada. We determined the planned sample 
size to be in line with past similar non-randomized fea -
sibility studies [53, 54]. Eligibility criteria for caregivers 
included being the primary caregiver of at least one child 
aged 3–8 years and living in [masked for review]. Eligibil -
ity criteria for educators included working with children 
3–8 years in the education, early years programming, or 
child care sectors of [masked for review]. Educators’ years 
of experience ranged from less than 4 to 32 (M = 15.31, 
SD = 8.36). The participating educators worked in a vari -
ety of settings, including in schools as teachers (42.3%), 
in child care centers as child care providers (42.3%), and 
in early years child and family programming centers and 
resource support organizations as early childhood edu -
cators (15.4%). The sample’s demographics are reported 
in Table  1. Aligned with the high rates of racial and eth -
nic diversity in this region, 83% of caregivers and 62% 
of educators identified as a member of a visible minor -
ity group. Among caregivers who migrated to Canada, 
71% reported arriving in Canada between 2 and 35 years 
before study enrollment (M = 12.8, SD = 9.6), with 82% 
reporting that their child was born in Canada. The cur -
rent study occurred in October 2021, in the midst of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 18  months after 
the first COVID-19 cases and lockdowns in Ontario, 
and while the Delta variant was considered the key vari -
ant of concern. At the start of the study, a lockdown was 
not in effect and approximately 71.5% of Ontarians had 
been vaccinated with two doses [55]. To provide relevant 
context, caregivers and educators reported COVID-19 
impacts they had experienced across various areas of 
their lives, including negative changes in their access to 
social supports, self-care routine, emotional health and 
well-being service access, medical health care access, 
food security, and income/employment (see Fig. 1).
Procedure
The study was conducted according to the guidelines 
of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the 
[masked for review] Research Ethics Board [protocol 
number masked for review]. Caregivers and educators 
provided informed consent prior to participating. The 
Page 6 of 20 Speidel et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:148 
training was delivered virtually in October 2021 over the 
course of 1 month via a web-based learning management 
system and was facilitated by two developmental psy -
chology PhDs and an educator with experience in family 
and service provider supports. To facilitate training eval -
uation, caregivers and educators completed a pre-survey, 
a series of post-surveys (after each module session), and a 
2-month follow-up survey.
The RAISE training
The training, formally referred to as Research and Prac -
tice Partnership: Building Awareness and Increasing 
Social-Emotional Capacity in the Early Years (RAISE), is 
comprised of three modules, with each module delivered 
weekly over the course of 3 weeks. Module 1 introduces 
the three core components of social-emotional develop -
ment outlined in the introduction of this paper: emotion 
regulation, other-oriented social-emotional capacities, 
and self-oriented social-emotional capacities [9]. The 
module presents the definitions, developmental impor -
tance, and typical development of each social-emotional 
component from ages 3–8  years, and provides practi -
cal strategies that caregivers and educators can use to 
promote each component, such as emotion coaching, 
mindfulness, and modelling. Module 2 highlights the 
importance of early relationships for supporting healthy 
child social-emotional development, based in relational-
developmental systems approaches of care [26] with a 
focus on knowledge and practical application of three 
core caregiving processes grounded in developmental 
theory and cross-cultural empirical work: warmth, sensi -
tivity, and structure/autonomy support [56, 57]. Module 
3 highlights mental health, including the impacts of stress 
on social-emotional development and resilience, and 
emphasizes protective factors that can support children’s, 
caregivers’ , and educators’ mental health during and after 
stressful situations, such as COVID-19 [58]. Further, 
this module includes an additional section for educators 
on the utility of assessment tools to help with monitor -
ing, evaluating, and understanding individual children’s 
social-emotional and stress-management capacities.
Each module included an asynchronous solo session 
and a synchronous group session. Each asynchronous 
session consisted of three 15-min videos that participants 
viewed at their own pace during the week. The videos 
delivered the core knowledge-based training content and 
were accompanied by at-home and at-care strategies for 
participants to practice during the week. The application-
based synchronous group sessions occurred at the end of 
each week were 90 min long, and included 3 components: 
(1) a guided mindfulness exercise, (2) a semi-structured 
question-and-answer group discussion and reflec -
tion, and (3) interactive small- and large-group practice Table 1 Caregiver and educator demographics

room learning approach, whereby participants engaged 
in self-guided learning in combination with interac -

knowledge of basic concepts by making connections 
between personal experiences and others’ experiences. 
This flexible and interactive blended approach supports 
improved learning relative to more traditional teaching 
methods [59]. Two synchronous group sessions were run 
each week (1 session for caregivers, n = 24; 1 session for 
educators, n = 26). Each synchronous session was facili -
tated by two developmental psychologists and a family 
supports practitioner. Synchronous sessions supported 
active participant involvement in two central ways: (1) 
multiple avenues for participant sharing were provided 
for different preferences (i.e., verbally or orally, via the 
chat feature, or anonymously through polls and online 
tools used throughout the sessions), (2) we made use of 
a combination of large and small group activities (with 
3–4 participants in the small group activities) to give all 
participants the opportunity to share and learn from each 
other. Table  2 provides more details on the RAISE train -
ing, including information about the aim, content, and 
strategies included in each session.The training focuses on early to middle childhood—
specifically the 3–8 age range—for two reasons. First, 
the core social-emotional components that are the focus 
of the current training undergo significant development 
during this period, making these optimal ages to benefit 
from the training. For example, around age 3, emotion 
regulation, sadness over wrongdoing, problem-solving, 
perspective taking, and empathy clearly emerge and 
rapidly develop alongside increases in the complexity of 
children’s social environments as they navigate different 
childcare and educational settings [7]. Second, caregiv -
ers and educators serve as critical socialization agents 
during this time, and children are particularly moldable 
to socialization efforts during these periods [60]. Given 
that different elements of these core capacities develop 
at different rates during the 3–8 age range, developmen -
tally appropriate strategies were tailored for younger 
(3–5 years) and older (6–8 years) children to ensure that 
the strategies were appropriate to each age range. For 
example, one of the strategies designed to support emo -
tion regulation was to be an emotion coach by engaging 
in emotionally supportive and validating emotion-based 
discussions with children. The training provides exam -
ples of how these conversations may look for younger 
children, with the caregiver/educator playing a more

dren’s emotions (e.g., “You look like you are sad”), ver -
sus older children, where the caregiver/educator might 
encourage children to lead the conversation and label 
how they are feeling (e.g., “How are you feeling?”).
Measures
Figure  2 details the training schedule and when specific 
measures were assessed.
COVID‑19 impacts
At pre-training, caregivers and educators reported on six 
items assessing negative changes due to the pandemic 
across various areas of their lives. Items were adapted 
from the Coronavirus Impact Scale [61] and included 
negative changes in access to social supports, men -
tal health services, medical health care, food security, 
and income/employment. An additional item assess -
ing changes in self-care practices was developed in col -
laboration with our community partners. The items were 
rated on a 4-point scale (1: no change, 2: mild change, 3: 
moderate change, 4: severe change) and included example 
anchors to further clarify the extent of negative change. 
For example, the social supports item was: How much 
has the Coronavirus pandemic impacted your access 
to extended family and non-family social supports. The 
response options for this item were: No change, Mild 
change–Continued visits with social distancing and/
or regular phone calls and/or tele-video or social media 
contacts, Moderate change–Loss of in person and remote 
contact with a few people, but not all supports, Severe change–Loss of in person and remote contact with almost 
all or all supports.
Satisfaction with the training
After each asynchronous and synchronous session, car -
egivers and educators reported their satisfaction with the 
session on a 10-point scale (1: very dissatisfied, 4: some -
what dissatisfied, 7: somewhat satisfied, 10: very satis -
fied). One week after training completion, participants 
reported their overall satisfaction with the training.
Perceptions of learning
After each asynchronous and synchronous session, car -
egivers and educators reported their perceptions of their 
own learning from the session on one item, “To what 
extent do you feel that you learned something new?” . 
The item was rated on a 10-point scale (1: not at all, 4: 
to a small extent, 7: to a moderate extent, 10: to a large 
extent).
Intent to use strategies
After each asynchronous and synchronous session, car -
egivers and educators reported the extent to which they 
felt they were likely to use any of the strategies described 
in the session on a single item, “To what extent would 
you use any of the strategies mentioned in this session?” . 
The item was rated on a 10-point scale (1: not at all, 4: 
to a small extent, 7: to a moderate extent, 10: to a large 
extent).
Use of training strategies
One week after the training, caregivers and educators 
reported their actual use of training-based strategies Fig. 2 Training schedule and measurement timing for the current study. a Applicable knowledge items were assessed after each module session 
and were averaged together to form one post ‑training knowledge variable
Page 10 of 20 Speidel et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:148 
(e.g., mindfulness, emotion coaching) on a single item, 
“To what extent do you use any of the strategies from the 
training?” . The item was rated on a 10-point scale (1: not 
at all, 4: sometimes, 7: often, 10: very often).
Knowledge of training content
At pre-training, after each asynchronous and synchro -
nous session, and at the 2-month follow-up, caregivers 
and educators rated their understanding of core social-
emotional concepts targeted in the training using 18 
items. The items were developed by the first, fourth, and 
fifth authors to assess knowledge of core social-emotional 
concepts targeted in the training (e.g., “I understand what 
emotion regulation is and how it develops”), and knowl -
edge of how to apply core social-emotional concepts (e.g., 
“I know how to support children’s emotion regulation”). 
Items were rated on a 10-point scale (1: entirely disagree, 
4: somewhat disagree, 7: somewhat agree, 10: entirely 
agree ). Individual scores across the 18 items were aver -
aged to form pre-training, post-training,1 and 2-month 
follow-up scores (αcaregiver  = 0.95 and 0.99; αeducator  = 0.96 
and 0.98).
Child social‑emotional capacities
At pre-training and the 2-month follow-up, caregiv -
ers reported their child’s emotion regulation, empa -
thy for others, and sadness over wrongdoing using the 
Social-Emotional Responding Task [62]. These capacities 
were assessed as they map onto the core components of 
social-emotional development highlighted in the train -
ing: emotion regulation, other-oriented social-emotional 
capacities, and self-oriented social-emotional capaci -
ties, respectively. Caregivers completed 12 items assess -
ing emotion regulation (e.g., “My child calmly deals with 
what is making them mad” , α = 0.89 and 0.91), 4 items 
assessing empathy (e.g., “My child feels bad for other 
children who are sad” , α = 0.70 and 0.92), and 4 items 
assessing sadness over wrongdoing (e.g., “When my 
child does something that makes another child feel sad, 
they feel sad” , α = 0.76 and 0.77). Items were rated on a 
4-point scale (0: not at all, 1: sometimes true, 2: often true, 
3: almost always true) and were averaged to form emo -
tion regulation, empathy, and sadness over wrongdoing 
scores.
Child mental health challenges
At pre-training and the 2-month follow-up, caregivers 
rated 7 items assessing their child’s internalizing symp -
toms (e.g., “My child has many worries or often seems worried”; α = 0.78 and 0.81) and 7 items assessing their 
child’s externalizing symptoms (e.g., “My child often 
fights with other children or bullies them”; α = 0.69 and 
0.78) from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire 
[63].2 Items were rated on a 3-point scale (0: not true, 1: 
somewhat true, 2: certainly true) and averaged into a sin -
gle mental health challenges variable, with higher scores 
indicating greater mental health challenges.
Caregiver and educator depressive and anxiety symptoms
At pre-training and the 2-month follow-up, caregiv -
ers and educators reported their depressive symptoms 
over the previous 2 weeks with 2 items from the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-2 [64] (e.g., “Little interest or 
pleasure in doing things”; Pearson’s rcaregiver  = 0.76–0.82; 
reducator  = 0.48 and 0.74) and their anxiety symptoms over 
the same period with 2 items from the Generalized Anxi -
ety Disorder-2 [65] (e.g., “Not being able to stop or con -
trol worrying”; rcaregiver  = 0.77 and 0.84; reducator  = 0.64 and 
0.84). Items were rated on a 4-point scale (0: not at all, 1: 
several days, 2: over half the days, 3: nearly every day) and 
averaged into respective depressive and anxiety symp -
toms scores.
Data analytic plan
For our first research question of interest, we assessed 
retention throughout the training via course metrics 
available through the web-based LMS (learning man -
agement system), including the percent of registered 
learners who completed each session. Consistent with 
conventions for effective interventions, we considered 
a retention rate at or above 80% to be a marker of ade -
quate retention [66]. Further, we conducted a descriptive 
analysis of caregivers’ and educators’ training satisfac -
tion based on their self-reports of satisfaction with the 
training.
To assess our second research question of if this pilot 
showed preliminary evidence that caregivers’ and educa -
tors’ knowledge of social-emotional concepts increased 
between pre-training, post-training, and the 2-month 
follow-up, we conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA 
in SPSS 28 evaluating changes in knowledge across the 
three timepoints. Group status (0: caregiver, 1: educator) 
1 Caregivers’ and educators’ responses after each asynchronous and syn-
chronous training session were averaged into a single post-training score.2 Internal consistencies of the original 10-item internalizing and external-
izing scales were poor (α < .60). To address this, two factor analyses were 
conducted. Based on the factor analyses results, three items were removed 
from the internalizing scale (i.e., “My child is rather solitary, or prefers to 
play alone” , “My child has at least one good friend” , “My child is generally 
liked by other children”) and three items were removed from the external-
izing scale (i.e., “My child is constantly fidgeting or squirming” , “My child is 
often argumentative with adults/lies or cheats” , “My child can be spiteful to 
others/steals from home or school or elsewhere”) to maximize internal con-
sistency. Removing these items improved alpha to > .60 at all time points.

was considered as a between-subjects factor to evaluate 
differences between caregivers and educators in changes 
in knowledge over time. If Mauchly’s test of sphericity 
was statistically significant, suggesting that sphericity 
could not be assumed, the Greenhouse–Geisser results 
were reported. Additionally, where significant univari -
ate effects emerged, follow-up pairwise comparisons 
were conducted with Bonferroni corrections. To evaluate 
the prevalence of training strategy use at post-training, 
caregivers’ and educators’ use of training strategies was 
evaluated using a descriptive analysis of means, standard 
deviations, and ranges.
To answer our third research question of whether 
there was preliminary evidence that changes in caregiv -
ers’ knowledge and caregivers’ use of training strategies 
were associated with changes in child social-emotional 
and mental health outcomes, we conducted four mul -
tiple regression analyses in Mplus  8 [67], one for each 
child outcome. The independent variables in each model 
were changes in caregiver knowledge from pre- to post-
training and caregiver use of strategies at post-training. 
We also investigated the interaction of these two vari -
ables because we expected that increases in knowledge 
may not have a downstream impact on child function -
ing unless the knowledge was actually put into practice. 
The dependent variable in each model was changes in 
the child outcome (emotion regulation, empathy for oth -
ers, sadness over wrongdoing, mental health challenges) 
from pre-training to the 2-month follow-up. Specifically, 
we formed difference score variables reflecting changes 
in caregiver knowledge by subtracting knowledge at 
pre-training from knowledge at post-training such that 
positive values on the change score indicated increases 
in knowledge and negative scores indicated decreases 
in knowledge from pre- to post-training. Similarly, we 
formed change scores for each child outcome by subtract -
ing the 2-month follow-up score from the pre-training 
score. All regression models were designed to maximize 
a temporal sequence from the independent variables to 
the dependent variables (i.e., such that changes in knowl -
edge were considered from pre- to post-training, use of 
training-based strategies was considered at post-training, 
and changes in each outcome variable of interest were 
considered from pre-training to the 2-month follow-up).
To answer our final research question about whether 
there was preliminary evidence that changes in caregiv -
ers’ and educators’ knowledge and their higher use of 
training strategies were associated with changes in their 
depressive and anxiety symptoms, we conducted two 
multiple regression analyses in Mplus  8 (one for each of 
depressive and anxiety symptoms). In each regression, 
the independent variables were changes in caregiver 
and educator knowledge from pre- to post-training, caregiver and educator use of strategies at post-training, 
and the interaction between these two variables. In one 
model, the dependent variable was changes in caregiver 
and educator depressive symptoms from pre-training to 
the 2-month follow-up. In the other model, the depend -
ent variable was changes in anxiety symptoms from pre-
training to the 2-month follow-up.
Missing data analysis
To evaluate patterns of missingness in the data, Little’s 
test of missing completely at random (MCAR) was con -
ducted for the primary study variables of each research 
question. Little’s test was nonsignificant for research 
question 2, χ2(10) = 13.78, p = 0.18, and research ques -
tion 3, χ2(35) = 47.60, p = 0.08, suggesting that the miss -
ing data did not violate assumptions of MCAR. Little’s 
test was statistically significant for research question 
4, χ2(45) = 75.1, p = 0.003, suggesting that the missing 
data violated the assumption of MCAR. Specifically, 
caregivers and educators who reported higher depres -
sive and anxiety symptoms at pre-training and the 
2-month follow-up were more likely to have missing data 
(ps =  < 001–0.03). Thus, to handle missing data, research 
question two was conducted in SPSS 28 using multiple 
imputation with the expectation–maximization method, 
with demographic and primary study variables included 
as auxiliary variables over 25 iterations, as this approach 
is robust under assumptions of MCAR. Research ques -
tions 3 and 4 were evaluated in Mplus  8 using full infor -
mation maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation as this 
method is robust under conditions of MAR and MCAR. 
To maximize power, all multiple regression models were 
tested using 5000 bootstrap resamples and the boot -
strapped 95% confidence interval results were assessed to 
determine significance.
Results
Means and standard deviations are reported in Table  3. 
Below, we report the results for each of our objectives.
Research question 1
One caregiver who initially accepted did not start the 
training, leaving a sample of 24 caregivers. All 26 educa -
tors who accepted started the training. Of the 50 partici -
pants, 45 (90%) completed the module 1 asynchronous 
session, 43 (86%) completed the module 1 synchronous 
group session, 38 (76%) completed the module 2 asyn -
chronous session, 42 (84%) completed the module 2 syn -
chronous group session, 39 (78%) completed the module 
3 asynchronous session, and 41 (82%) completed the 
module 3 synchronous group session. On average, partic -
ipants completed 83% of the training sessions and rates 
of attendance were similar for caregivers and educators,

t(48) =  − 1.10, p = 0.28. Ninety-six percent of caregiv -
ers reported being somewhat satisfied (i.e., 7 out of 10 
on our scale) to very satisfied (i.e., 10 out of 10) after 
each training session (with one-third [33%] reporting 
being very satisfied). At post-training, 95% of caregiv -
ers reported being somewhat satisfied to very satisfied 
with the training overall (with one-third [33%] reporting 
being very satisfied). One hundred percent of educators 
reported being somewhat satisfied to very satisfied after 
each session (with over half [60%] reporting being very 
satisfied). At post-training, 100% of educators reported 
being somewhat satisfied to very satisfied with the train -
ing overall (with over half [56%] reporting being very 
satisfied).
Regarding suitability and intent to use the training, 
95% of caregivers reported that they felt they had learned 
something new in each training session to a moderate to 
large extent (with 30% reporting they felt they learned 
something new to a large extent). Ninety-seven percent 
of caregivers reported that they were likely to try the 
strategies mentioned in each session to a moderate to 
large extent (with 47% reporting they were likely to try 
the strategies to a large extent). Ninety-six percent of 
educators reported that they felt they had learned some -
thing new in each training session to a moderate to large 
extent (with 44% reporting they felt they learned some -
thing new to a large extent). One hundred percent of edu -
cators reported that they were likely to try the strategies 
mentioned in the session to a moderate to large extent (with 55% reporting they were likely to try the strategies 
to a large extent).
Research question 2
The test of within-subjects effects revealed statistically 
significant changes in participant knowledge between at 
least two time points, F(1.51, 72.67) = 46.47, p < 0.001, η2
p 
= 0.49. Specifically, across participants, there were signif -
icant increases in knowledge from pre- to post-training 
(mean difference = 1.13, SE = 0.16, p < 0.001; d = 0.90), and 
from pre-training to the 2-month follow-up (mean differ -
ence = 1.21, SE = 0.16, p < 0.001; d = 0.90). There was no 
change in knowledge from post-training to the 2-month 
follow-up (mean difference = 0.08, SE = 0.09, p = 1.00; 
d = 0.10). The pattern of results suggested that caregivers’ 
and educators’ knowledge increased from pre- to post-
training and that these increases were maintained by the 
2-month follow-up.
The test of within-subjects by between-subjects inter -
action revealed significant differences in knowledge 
between caregivers and educators, F(1.51, 72.67) = 7.82, 
p = 0.002, η2
p = 0.14. To probe the interaction, follow-up 
pairwise comparisons were conducted and indicated that 
educators were higher in knowledge relative to caregiv -
ers at pre-training (mean difference = 1.64, SE = 0.36, 
p < 0.001; d = 1.30), post-training (mean difference = 0.82, 
SE = 0.23, p < 0.001; d = 1.02), and the 2-month follow-up 
(mean difference = 0.58, SE = 0.21, p = 0.008; d = 0.79). In 
other words, educators started at a higher baseline level Table 3 Means and standard deviations of primary study variables

of knowledge of social-emotional concepts relative to 
caregivers, and maintained this gap across the training. 
To further probe the interaction effect, follow-up pair -
wise comparisons were conducted to examine patterns of 
change in educators and caregivers separately. These fol -
low-up comparisons revealed that although the general 
patterns of change in knowledge were consistent between 
caregivers and educators (see Fig.  3), the rate of change 
was higher for caregivers relative to educators. Specifi -
cally, both groups increased in knowledge from pre- to 
post-training (ps  < 0.001–0.006), but the effect size was 
large for caregivers (mean difference = 1.55, SE = 0.23, 
p < 0.001; d = 1.23) and medium for educators (mean dif -
ference = 0.72, SE = 0.22, p = 0.006; d = 0.57). Similarly, 
both groups increased in knowledge from pre-training 
to the 2-month follow-up (ps  < 0.001–0.01), but the effect 
size was large for caregivers (mean difference = 1.74, 
SE = 0.23, p < 0.001; d = 1.38) and medium for educators 
(mean difference = 0.68, SE = 0.22, p = 0.01; d = 0.54). 
Both groups remained relatively consistent in their 
change in knowledge from post-training to the 2-month 
follow-up (ps  = 0.45–1.00; dcaregiver  = 0.25, deducator  = 0.05). 
Thus, the significant within-subjects by between-subjects 
interaction effect was driven by caregivers (who were 
lower in knowledge relative to educators throughout the 
training) showing slightly steeper improvements in their 
knowledge from pre- to post-training and from pre- to 
2-month follow-up, relative to educators.
On average, participants reported high strategy use 
at post-training (Mcaregiver  = 8.17, SDcaregiver  = 1.69, 
 Rangecaregiver  = 5–10; Meducator  = 8.17, SDeducator  = 1.69, 
 Rangeeducator  = 4–10), as their mean scores were between 
the anchor points of often (7) and very often (10). One hundred percent of participants reported using the train -
ing-based strategies at least sometimes (4).

there were no significant differences between caregiv -

that the pattern results were consistent for caregivers 
and educators.Discussion
This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a brief social-
emotional training for caregivers and educators of chil -
dren ages 3 to 8  years, and showed signs of positive 
efficacy across all objectives. Notably, caregivers and 
educators showed adequate retention throughout the 
training and expressed high satisfaction with the ini -
tiative. Further, preliminary evidence revealed that both 
caregivers and educators reported significant increases in 
knowledge of social-emotional concepts that were main -
tained 2 months after the training. Additionally, the pilot 
evidence suggests that increases in participants’ knowl -
edge and their greater use of the training-based strate -
gies were associated with improvements in children’s 
social-emotional capacities and in their own mental 
health. These preliminary results suggest that the current 
training may be a fruitful response to existing gaps in 
caregiver and educator social-emotional training oppor -
tunities, and extend the existing literature by showing Fig. 4 Interaction plot. Increases in knowledge from pre ‑ to post ‑training in relation to changes in child emotion regulation from pre ‑ to 2‑month

regulation was − 0.75 to 1.08. Positive scores on changes in emotion regulation denote increases, whereas negative scores on changes in emotion 
regulation denote decreases

positive efficacy of a brief, research-based training ini -
tiative that aims to directly translate and apply social-
emotional research and theory into accessible training for 
caregivers and educators.
The training showed preliminary evidence of being 
successful in improving both caregivers’ and educators’ 
knowledge of children’s core social-emotional concepts, 
such as emotion regulation, empathy, self-reflection, 
and sadness over wrongdoing. Specifically, caregivers’ 
and educators’ knowledge increased from pre- to post-
training and newfound knowledge was maintained at the 
2-month follow-up, suggesting some evidence of train -
ing sustainability. The RAISE training adopts a flexible, 
blended training structure whereby participants are given 
the autonomy to engage with core knowledge-based com -
ponents of each module in a self-paced manner accord -
ing to their own schedules and needs. These sessions 
were supplemented with weekly synchronous virtual ses -
sions that emphasized group discussion, reflection, and 
application of core concepts to support deeper under -
standing of the content and translation into real-world 
practice. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction 
with the training and after each session, suggesting that 
they found value in the asynchronous and synchronous 
components, corroborating past work on the benefits of 
blended learning [59].
Increases in caregiver knowledge and greater use of 
training-based strategies were associated with steeper 
improvements in child social-emotional capacities in 
unique ways. Specifically, caregivers’ higher use of train -
ing-based strategies was associated with increases in their children’s empathy and sadness over wrongdoing. Fur -
ther, caregivers’ increases in knowledge were associated 
with increases in child emotion regulation when they also 
reported greater use of training-based strategies. These 
findings add promising evidence to literature underscor -
ing the utility of social-emotional training initiatives for 
supporting child outcomes [31]. They also align with 
ecological systems, family systems theory, and relational-
developmental systems approaches whereby positive 
changes in children’s rearing environment are expected 
to cascade into positive changes in their development 
[68]. Intervening across children’s broader micro-system 
via caregivers’ and educators’ capacities to support child 
social-emotional development may be a fruitful approach 
to comprehensive and sustained developmental care.
Despite positive impacts on children’s social-emo -
tional capacities, there were no preliminary associations 
between training outcomes and child mental health 
challenges. Notably, some theoretical and conceptual 
approaches identify emotion regulation (which was 
shown to increase with training outcomes) as a core fea -
ture of mental health [69]. Further, although the pilot 
training included a focus on the impacts of stress and 
mental health, it is possible that such impacts may occur 
further downstream through other effects of the train -
ing. In line with a developmental cascade perspective, 
impacts of the social-emotional training on child mental 
health may occur over a more protracted period through 
impacts on child social-emotional capacities [70]. Such 
effects may also occur through changes in caregivers’ 
and educators’ own mental health. Past longitudinal Fig. 5 Interaction plot. Increases in knowledge from pre ‑ to post ‑training in relation to changes in caregiver and educator depressive symptoms 
from pre ‑ to 2‑month post ‑training at lower (− 1 SD) and higher (+ 1 SD) levels of use of training strategies post ‑training. The observed range 
of changes in caregiver and educator depressive symptoms was − 2.00 to 2.00. Positive scores on changes in depressive symptoms denote 
increases, whereas negative scores denote decreases

work evaluating long-term effects of social-emotional 
and related training initiatives has indicated evidence of 
“sleeper effects” , whereby training leads to delayed mental 
health benefits (e.g., later reductions in conduct problems 
or depressive symptoms) [71, 72]. For example, Jones 
and colleagues showed that effects of their social-emo -
tional training led to reductions in child aggression and 
increases in social competence over a period of 2  years 
after the training occurred [73]. Our future work scaling 
up this intervention will aim to employ more extended 
longitudinal follow-ups to elucidate potential long-term 
or cascading effects of caregiver and educator social-
emotional training on child mental health.
The current training also showed preliminary evidence 
of providing direct benefits for caregivers and educa -
tors. Specifically, caregivers’ and educators’ greater use of 
training strategies was associated with reductions in their 
depressive symptoms from pre-training to post-training. 
This might suggest that the training strategies alone may 
buffer feelings of hopelessness that are common with 
depression, perhaps because these strategies provide con -
crete examples of behaviors that can help support mental 
health. Further, caregivers’ and educators’ increases in 
knowledge were associated with reductions in anxiety 
when they also reported higher use of training-based 
strategies. Thus, it was the combination of high strategy 
use and increases in knowledge that was associated with 
reductions in anxiety. This might suggest that to reduce 
anxiety, it may be necessary to support adults’ recogni -
tion of the underlying development and rationale behind 
different strategies. It is possible that increases in knowl -
edge work to facilitate increased confidence or feelings 
of control in their caregiving abilities, which, when cou -
pled with higher strategy use, is accompanied by reduc -
tions in anxiety. Incorporating mental health strategies 
focused on supporting caregiver and educator mental 
health addresses gaps around adult well-being in exist -
ing social-emotional training initiatives, underscoring the 
importance of incorporating strategies (e.g., mindfulness, 
stress management, emotion regulation strategies) that 
caregivers and educators can use to support their own 
mental health and social-emotional capacities. Although 
the current findings require further replication, they may 
be promising given existing literature establishes del -
eterious links between caregiver mental health and child 
well-being [74]. Particularly, caregivers with psycho -
pathologies such as depression are less likely to engage in 
positive parenting behaviors, which in turn pose risk for 
children’s well-being [75]. Thus, intervention approaches 
that aim to improve caregiver mental health symptoms 
and support their parenting behaviors may be particu -
larly useful for supporting improved caregiver and child 
outcomes [76]. It is also possible that our approach of supporting caregivers and educators with research-based 
knowledge in a manner that recognizes and builds upon 
their existing competencies and strengths indirectly con -
tributed to their mental well-being by supporting their 
sense of competence as caregivers and educators [77]. 
Relatedly, these results may also be explained by the the -
oretical and empirical notion that “helping yourself helps 
others”; in other words, increasing one’s capacity to tol -
erate their own distress and challenges may better equip 
them to show compassion and support for others [22, 
78].
Our pilot results also highlight the importance of tar -
geting both knowledge and  practical application in 
social-emotional training initiatives. Knowledge of core 
social-emotional concepts and use of social-emotional 
promotion strategies supported child, caregiver, and edu -
cator outcomes. Further, associations between increases 
in providers’ knowledge and improvements in child 
emotion regulation and improvements in caregiver and 
educator anxiety symptoms were only significant when 
caregivers and educators also  reported higher use of 
strategies. Thus, our results emphasize that it may not be 
enough to simply increase knowledge or use of the strate -
gies. Instead, it may be most beneficial when caregivers 
and educators practice evidence-based strategies with a 
solid understanding of the developmental processes and 
mechanisms that underly those strategies. One caregiver 
noted the helpfulness of making connections between 
theory and application in daily life: “The training was 
incredibly helpful and very easy to apply in day-to-day 
life. This is so crucial because I have been in numerous 
training sessions that give some great theory…but don’t 
connect easily in our day-to-day lives. ” When caregiv -
ers and educators are supported with the tools needed 
to make connections between theory and practice, this 
may support their capacity to act with informed, inten -
tional care, thereby increasing the chances that their 
behaviors translate into improvements in children’s and 
their own social-emotional capacities and mental health 
[32]. With the results from this pilot study in mind, our 
future scaled-up implementation will strive to incorpo -
rate additional strategies and opportunities for practical 
application.
In sum, the present results are promising and seem 
to be aligned with past evidence indicating the utility of 
brief interventions as a cost effective and proportionally 
(or possibly even more) successful prevention approach 
relative to more intensive, lengthy, and costly interven -
tion approaches [79]. Strengths of the current training 
include its strengths-based focus and its links with sup -
port positive changes at multiple levels of the child’s rear -
ing environment. However, there are limitations to the 
present study that bear mentioning. First, only caregivers 
Page 18 of 20 Speidel et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2023) 9:148 
reported on children’s social-emotional capacities, which 
may have introduced shared method variance. Although 
caregiver reports can often provide informative and 
reliable insights into children’s well-being and social-
emotional capacities [80], future related work should 
consider child self-reports or child behavioral assess -
ments of social-emotional capacities and mental health. 
Our future work will evaluate changes in children under 
educators’ care as this can inform understanding of 
whether changes in educator knowledge and knowledge 
application translate to support child social-emotional 
and mental health outcomes in educational and child 
care settings. Finally, as a pilot study, the current pro -
ject was limited in sample size. This precluded us from 
using more robust statistical techniques to assess training 
impacts, such as latent change and latent growth curve 
modelling. Similarly, the current study did not include 
a control group or a randomized controlled trial design, 
which prevented us from evaluating effects of the train -
ing relative to a between-person baseline. Participating 
caregivers and educators likely had some experience with 
the community services who supported recruitment for 
the current pilot, which may have impacted the potential 
generalizability of our results. Including further metrics 
of feasibility, such as proportion of the interested popu -
lation that was reached, and formally reporting engage -
ment in the live group sessions would have strengthened 
the current design. Clinical implications will become 
more apparent when the training is evaluated within a 
large-scale randomized controlled trial. Nonetheless, this 
feasibility study serves as a critical first step that informs 
our preparation for a full-scale randomized controlled 
trial of the present training.
Conclusions
In sum, the current findings offer promising preliminary 
evidence for the efficacy of a novel research-based train -
ing initiative to support caregivers’ and educators’ capac -
ities to nurture child social-emotional development. They 
emphasize the importance of infusing both research-
based knowledge and practical strategy-based applica -
tion into caregiver and educator training initiatives, and 
speak to the viability of targeting developmental change 
in children at the level of the caregiver. Further, they 
underscore caregivers’ and educators’ own mental well-
being amidst the stress of home life and service settings 
as foundational to supporting positive child developmen -
tal outcomes.
