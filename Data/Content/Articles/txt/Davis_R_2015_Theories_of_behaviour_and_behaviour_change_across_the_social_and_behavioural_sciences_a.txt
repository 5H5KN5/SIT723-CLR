Interventions to change health-related behaviours typically have modest effects and
may be more effective if grounded in appropriate theory. Most theories applied topublic health interventions tend to emphasise individual capabilities and motivation,
with limited reference to context and social factors. Intervention effectiveness may be
increased by drawing on a wider range of theories incorporating social, cultural andeconomic factors that influence behaviour. The primary aim of this paper is to identifytheories of behaviour and behaviour change of potential relevance to public health
interventions across four scientific disciplines: psychology, sociology, anthropology
and economics. We report in detail the methodology of our scoping review used toidentify these theories including which involved a systematic search of electronicdatabases, consultation with a multidisciplinary advisory group, web searching,
searching of reference lists and hand searching of key behavioural science journals.
Of secondary interest we developed a list of agreed criteria for judging the quality ofthe theories. We identified 82 theories and 9 criteria for assessing theory quality. The
potential relevance of this wide-ranging number of theories to public health
interventions and the ease and usefulness of evaluating the theories in terms of thequality criteria are however yet to be determined.
Keywords: behaviour change; health behaviour; theory; behavioural interventions
Introduction
Human behaviours, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, dietary behaviours,
physical activity and sexual practices, play a key role in many of the leading causesof death in developing and developed countries (Aveyard & West, 2007 ; Danaei et al.,
2009 ; Ezzati et al., 2002 ; Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, & Gerberding, 2004 ; Parkin, Boyd, &
Walker, 2011; Solomon & Kington, 2002 ). Even small changes in such behaviours can
have substantial effects on population health outcomes (Ezzati et al., 2002 ; Mokdad et al.,
2004 ; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2010 ; Solomon &
Kington, 2002 ). Understanding these behaviours and the contexts in which they occur is
essential for developing effective evidence-based health behaviour change interventions
and policies and for reducing avoidable mobility and mortality (House of Lords, 2011;
Office of Behavioural and Social Sciences Research, 2006 ).
Despite the relatively small investment in preventive health and behavioural science
(Marteau, Dieppe, Foy, Kinmonth, & Schneiderman, 2006 ), there is evidence for the

effectiveness of behaviour change interventions at individual, community and population
levels (Abraham, Kelly, West, & Michie, 2009 ; Albarracin et al., 2005 ; Michie & West,
2013 ; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2007 ; Nigg, Allegrante, & Ory,
2002 ). Interventions have been targeted at behavioural risk factors (e.g., smoking; Carr &
Ebbert, 2012 ; Rice & Stead, 2008 ), encouraging protective behaviours (e.g., health
screening; Brouwers et al., 2011; Everett et al., 2011), improving adaptation to chronic
and acute illness (e.g., adherence to medical advice; Cutrona et al., 2010 ) and changing
health professional behaviours to improve the quality and efficiency of services (e.g.,hand hygiene compliance; Fuller et al., 2012 ). While there are many examples of
successful interventions, there are also examples of ineffective interventions (e.g.,Coleman, 2010 ; Summerbell et al., 2005 ); for those that are effective, the effects tend
to be modest, with significant heterogeneity of short-term and long-term effects (Michie,
Johnston, Francis, Hardeman, & Eccles, 2008 ).
To maximise the potential efficacy of interventions, it is necessary to understand
behaviour and behaviour change: in other words, it is necessary to have a theoreticalunderstanding of behaviour change. In this context, theory represents the accumulated
knowledge of the mechanisms of action (mediators) and moderators of change as well as
the a priori assumptions about what human behaviour is, and what the influences on itare. The application of theory is advocated as an integral step in intervention design andevaluation and in evidence synthesis, for example, by the UK Medical ResearchCouncil ’s guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions (Campbell et al.,
2000 ,2007 ; Craig et al., 2008 ; Glanz & Bishop, 2010 ). This is for several reasons. First,
the antecedents of behaviour and the causal determinants of change can be appropriatelyidentified and targeted by the intervention (Hardeman et al., 2005 ; Michie & Abraham,
2004 ; Michie et al., 2008 ) and component behaviour change techniques can be selected
and/or refined and tailored (Michie & Prestwich, 2010 ; Michie et al., 2008 ; Rothman,
2004 ). Second, theoretically identified mechanisms of action (i.e., mediators) can be
investigated to gain further understanding as to how the intervention brings about itseffects (Michie & Abraham, 2004 ; Rothman, 2004 ,2009 ). This allows researchers to
determine whether unsuccessful interventions have failed either because the interventionhas had no effect upon the hypothesised mediator or because the hypothesised (andsuccessfully influenced) mediator has had no effect upon behaviour (Michie & Abraham,
2004 ; Rothman, 2004 ,2009 ), thus facilitating more efficient refinement of the
intervention. Third, theory summarises the cumulative knowledge of how to changebehaviour across different populations, behaviours and contexts. Finally, theory-basedinterventions provide an opportunity in which theory can be tested. This aidsdevelopment of more useful theories which, in turn, supports intervention optimisation(Michie et al., 2008 ; Rothman, 2004 ).
The question as to whether interventions that are explicitly based on theory are more
effective that those that are not is a complex one. Some reviews have found a positiveassociation (Albada, Ausems, Bensing, & van Dulmen, 2009 ; Albarracin et al., 2005 ;
Glanz & Bishop, 2010 ; Noar, Benac, & Harris, 2007 ; Swann, Bowe, Kosmin, &
McCormick, 2003 ; Taylor, Conner, & Lawton, 2011), but others have found no
association, or, even a negative association (Gardner, Wardle, Poston, & Croker,
2011;
Roe, Hunt, Bradshaw, & Rayner, 1997 ; Stephenson, Imrie, & Sutton, 2000 ). Some
reviews have reported a mixture depending on the measure of effectiveness (Ammerman,Lindquist, Lohr, & Hersey, 2002 ; Bhattarai et al., 2013 ; Kim, Stanton, Li, Dickersin, &
Galbraith, 1997 ).2 R. Davis et al.
Downloaded by [179.180.195.73] at 05:18 31 August 2015 

There are several factors that may explain this mixed picture. Theory is often poorly
applied. A review investigating application of theory using the 19-item ‘Theory Coding
Scheme ’(Michie & Prestwich, 2010 ), found that only 10% of studies of theory-based
interventions reported links between behaviour change techniques and theoretical
constructs and only 9% reported that all the constructs had been targeted by behaviour
change techniques. Another explanation may be that the choice of theory may not havebeen appropriate. For example, if a behaviour is heavily influenced by habit or emotionalstates then a theory that focuses on beliefs and reflective thought processes may not beappropriate when informing intervention design.
The importance of understanding the theoretical underpinnings of behavioural
interventions has been highlighted in previous research suggesting theoretical bases forcombining behaviour change techniques within interventions to allow synergistic effects
and enhance their effectiveness (Dombrowski et al., 2012 ; Michie, Abraham, Whitting-
ton, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009 ; Taylor et al., 2011; Webb, Joseph, Yardley, & Michie,
2010 ). Despite the advantages of theory, behaviour change interventions are often
designed without reference to theory (Davies, Walker, & Grimshaw, 2010 ; Prestwich
et al., 2013 ). For instance, a recent meta-analysis found that only 22.5% of 235
implementation studies explicitly used theories of behaviour change (Davies et al., 2010 ).
Where theory is used, it is often only loosely referred to rather than rigorously applied tointervention design and evaluation (Painter, Borba, Hynes, Mays, & Glanz, 2008 ;
Prestwich et al., 2013 ). In those situations where interventions are based on ‘explicit
theory ’, theory is often used sub-optimally to develop or evaluate the intervention (e.g.,
only a few of the theoretical constructs may be targeted and/or theory is not used toappropriately tailor the intervention).
Choosing a relevant theory can be a challenging task for intervention designers,
especially given the large number of theories, many of which have the same oroverlapping constructs, to choose from (Michie et al., 2005 ). There is a lack of guidance
on how to select an appropriate theory for a particular purpose (Michie, 2008 ), with a
predominance in published intervention evaluations of a small number of theories that
have already gained recognition in the field (Painter et al., 2008 ). By using a ‘common ’
or‘favourite ’theory, rather than one that may be more suited to the particular
characteristics of the target population, behaviour and context, the potential benefit ofusing theory is limited.
One approach to addressing the plethora of different, overlapping theories and lack of
guidance as to how to choose between them was the development of the TheoreticalDomains Framework (TDF; Cane, O ’Connor, & Michie, 2012 ; Michie et al., 2005 ).
Developed by psychologists and implementation researchers, the TDF provides a
framework of theoretical domains to explain barriers and facilitators of behaviour inany particular situation. Informed by 128 explanatory constructs from 33 theories ofbehaviour, the TDF has been used in many contexts to understand behaviour and designtheoretically informed interventions (Francis, O ’Connor, & Curran, 2012 ; French et al.,
2012 ). Another resource for theory-informed research is the US National Institute of
Health ’s‘Grid Enabled Measures ’(GEM) web-based database. GEM provides the
descriptions of theoretical constructs and behavioural and social measures to assess these
constructs ( https://www.gem-beta.org/Public/Home.aspx ). While both these approaches
are of value, neither specifies relationships between theoretical domains and constructs interms of the effect that one domain or construct may have on another. They deal withtheoretical domains and constructs, not theories per se. One previous consensus exerciseHealth Psychology Review 3
Downloaded by [179.180.195.73] at 05:18 31 August 2015 

did generate a list of eight constructs thought to influence HIV-related behaviours, with
the resulting framework specifying links between the constructs and behaviour (Fishbeinet al., 2001 ). However, it is not clear how this consensus was reached and how relevant
the included constructs are to other behaviours, given the focus on HIV-related
behaviours. Researchers or interventions designers may want to select specific theories
either at the beginning of the intervention design process or after conducting somepreliminary research to indicate which theories are likely to be relevant and useful. Inthese situations there is a need for an accessible source of potentially useful theories, aswell as a method for selecting amongst them.
At present, theories used in public health and behaviour change interventions more
generally tend to emphasise individual and sometimes interpersonal rather than broadersocial and environmental variables (Glanz & Bishop, 2010 ). Capabilities and motivation
(individual factors) are often targeted, but context (social and environmental variables) isfar less likely to be considered. NICE ’s(2007 ) behaviour change guidance concluded that
interventions were more effective if they simultaneously targeted variables at differentlevels (e.g., individual, community and population; National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence, 2007 ). Therefore, to maximise effectiveness, intervention designers are likely
to benefit from drawing from a wider range of theories than currently used. Currentresources on theories of behaviour change tend to reflect specific contexts and disciplines,and are thus inevitably limited in the range of theories considered (Agar, 2008 ; Conner &
Norman, 2005 ; Glanz & Bishop, 2010 ; Glanz, Rimer, & Lewis, 2002 ).
To improve the selection and application of theory we need to consider, across
relevant disciplines, those theories which may be of potential use in informing publichealth questions. By identifying a range of theories we can assess which theories may beof value given the behaviour, population and context in question. To this end, weconducted a scoping review and consensus exercise, informed by the disciplines ofpsychology, sociology, anthropology and economics. The scoping review and consensusexercise primarily aimed to address the question, ‘What theories exist across the
disciplines of psychology, sociology, anthropology and economics that could be of value
to guiding behaviour change interventions? ’
To be as comprehensive as possible we focused on both theories of behaviour and
behaviour change. Theories of behaviour tend to be linear, and explain the reasons whybehaviour may occur by considering a number of predictors and their associations withone another and how these could influence the likelihood of a particular behaviour (Agar,
2008 ; Conner & Norman, 2005 ; Glanz & Rimer, 1997 ; Head & Noar, 2013 ). Theories of
change tend to be more cyclical and identify interactional and dynamic behaviour changeprocesses (Agar, 2008 ; Head & Noar, 2013 ). In practice, it is sometimes difficult to
distinguish between the two and some theories could be viewed as both.
Of secondary interest we also addressed ‘What criteria should we consider when
evaluating the quality and potential appropriateness of behaviour change theory? ’Finally,
we assessed the extent to which the theories we identified had been applied within thebehaviour change field.
The scope of the present paper is twofold: (i) to report in detail the methodology
employed to identify relevant theories and to produce a compendium of these theories
and (ii) to provide the list of agreed criteria for judging the quality of the theories. Ways
in which some of the theories have been used to study behaviour change are also brieflysummarised, though it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss this in detail. Researchexamining how the theories have been operationalised and the quality of their empirical4 R. Davis et al.

application (as measured by the quality criteria reported here) forms part of the future
research programme.
Methods
Theories of behaviour and behaviour change were identified through five sources: expert
consultation with a multidisciplinary project advisory group, electronic databases, web
searching, forward and backward searching of reference lists and hand searching of keybehavioural science journals. Empirical application of the theories was identified fromelectronic databases and searching the reference lists of retrieved articles. These, togetherwith expert consultations with the advisory group, informed the development of the
quality assessment criteria.
Expert advisory group
Twenty-four UK experts from the social and behavioural sciences and/or population
health research formed the advisory group, which determined the scope, methods andconduct of the review. The group comprised four sociologists, five economists, five
psychologists, four health service researchers, three anthropologists, two epidemiologists
and one policy researcher.
Definition of key terms
One of the first tasks of the advisory group was to agree definitions of the terms ‘theory ’
and‘behaviour ’. A shortlist of potentially relevant definitions of each term was compiled
from peer-reviewed journals, reports and books, for example, the American Psychological
Association Dictionary . In the first of two rounds of a Delphi process, advisory group
members were asked to rate each definition and parts of the definition for potential use.When a definition (or a part of it) was rated as important by at least 50% of the group itwas retained as relevant. In the second round, core concepts were extracted and
synthesised by the authors and used to create working definitions which were then
considered for refinement by the advisory group in order to create the final definitions:
The term theory was defined as: ‘a set of concepts and/or statements with
specification of how phenomena relate to each other. Theory provides an organising
description of a system that accounts for what is known, and explains and predicts
phenomena ’.
Behaviour was defined as: ‘anything a person does in response to internal or external
events. Actions may be overt (motor or verbal) and directly measurable or, covert
(activities not viewable but involving voluntary muscles) and indirectly measurable;
behaviours are physical events that occur in the body and are controlled by the brain ’.
Identification of relevant theories
To inform the literature search strategy, theories of behaviour and behaviour change were
identified through expert consultation with the advisory group and an initial scoping of
the literature using generic and discipline-specific terms related to behaviour and
behaviour change theories. For example, the term ‘cultural change ’tended to be used
by anthropologists, ‘action ’by sociologists and ‘behaviour ’by psychologists.Health Psychology Review 5

Literature search strategy
The literature search was conducted primarily to uncover theories of behaviour and
behaviour change that were not identified through expert consultation with our advisorygroup. Secondary to this we identified the ways in which the theories we identified had
been empirically applied. While we briefly report this, it was beyond the scope of the
study to analyse this comprehensively and in detail. In order to retrieve relevant literatureacross different disciplines six databases were searched between 1 January 1960 and 11
September 2012: PsycINFO, Econlit, Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews,
International Bibliography of Social Sciences, EMBASE and MEDLINE. Databaseswere chosen based on their coverage of discipline- and content-specific literature and on
the volume of public health literature. Databases that did not allow the use of wildcards
(to account for variations in spellings) or sets of search terms to be entered and combinedthrough the use of Boolean operators, and/or databases that only retrieved titles of articles
but not abstracts were not used (e.g., Anthropology Index Online). The final search was
conducted on the 11 September 2012.
The search strategy included four sets of search terms: those that (i) apply theory to
behaviour change (e.g., ‘behaviour change theory ’); (ii) are relevant to behaviour change
and also of relevance in understanding behaviour more generally [e.g., ‘Health Belief
Model ’(HBM)]; (iii) are relevant to behaviour change but that do not mention theory
(e.g., ‘behaviour modification ’); and (iv) discipline-specific terms combined with the term
behaviour change (e.g., ‘economics and behaviour change ’). A list of the search terms
together with how these terms were combined can be found in the online supplemental
material ( Supplemental Figure 1 ).
The search strategy was customised to each database. Standard filters were used to
capture systematic reviews where applicable. A sensitivity analysis was performed to
ensure that the search results included key articles on theories relevant to behaviour
change (identified through the initial scoping of the literature). Given the complex bodyof evidence, in terms of cross-cutting disciplines and sheer breadth and volume of
literature, the search was restricted to titles and abstracts to tighten the search specificity.
Additional potentially relevant theories were identified through expert consultation
and web searching for key documents from organisations known for their interest in
behaviour change. This included, from the USA, the National Institute of Health ’s
Behaviour Change Consortium and, from the UK, the NICE, Evidence for Policy andPractice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI Centre), Government Social
Research Unit, House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee Report on
Behaviour Change and National Institute of Health Research ’s Health Technology
Assessment.
Forward and backward citation searching, and hand searching of key behavioural
science journals were performed to minimise the likelihood of relevant theories beingmissed. The journals hand searched were: Annals of Behavioural Medicine ,BMC Health
Services Research ,British Journal of Health Psychology ,Health Psychology ,Health
Psychology Review ,Implementation Science ,International Journal of Clinical and
Health Psychology ,Journal of Applied Behavioural Science and Social Science &
Medicine .6 R. Davis et al.

Inclusion criteria for theories
Theories were included if they: (i) met our definition of theory and behaviour and (ii)
considered individual behaviour as an outcome or part of the process leading to the
outcome. Theories that considered group behaviour (e.g., ‘organisational behaviour ’),
without reference to individual behaviour were excluded. While we acknowledge that
such theories are of interest to intervention designers who want to change group
behaviour we decided to limit the scope of the review to theories concerned withindividual behaviour change to keep it manageable. The inclusion of each theory was
considered independently by at least two of the four authors and by members of the
advisory group. Inter-rater reliability was assessed.
Theories that focused purely on cognition were not included. Examples of such
theories include Social Comparison Theory (Festinger, 1954 ), which aims to explain how

Downloaded by [179.180.195.73] at 05:18 31 August 2015 

people ’s opinions are influenced within social groups and Cognitive Adaptation Theory
(Taylor, 1983 ), which aims to explain how people cognitively adapt to threatening events.
While these theories contribute to our understanding of knowledge, beliefs and intentionsabout behaviour there are often significant gaps between these and behaviour (Sheeran,
2002 ) and this project was about theories of behaviour and behaviour change.
We distinguished frameworks, which provide an organising structure, from theories
which, in addition, offer explanations of how phenomena relate to each other and permitoutcomes to be predicted. Thus, conceptual frameworks such as the TDF (Cane et al.,2012 ; Michie et al., 2005 ), or the Ecological Model (McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, &
Glanz, 1988 ) that are commonly used to guide the design, implementation or evaluation
of interventions were not included. While these frameworks have value in implementa-
tion and in public health research, policy and practice, this review was of specifictheories.
Inclusion criteria for articles
Screening of articles was in two stages. The first stage (title and abstract) was
intentionally inclusive, retaining articles if they mentioned: (i) theory in relation to
behaviour or behaviour change or (ii) changing behaviour but made no reference to
theory (the full text of the article was then checked to see if theory was used to inform theresearch). We considered all behaviour to be of relevance, not just health-relatedbehaviours. At the second stage of screening (full-text) tighter restrictions applied andarticles were included if: (i) theory and behaviour was defined as per our study definitionsand (ii) they fell into one of four categories of article: descriptive, intervention, evaluativeor review:
(1) Descriptive articles were defined as those that contained the original description
of a theory by the author/s who originally conceived of the theory (i.e., primarytheory sources) or by an author/s who proposed advances in the theory by
re-specification. Secondary theory sources (i.e., those that only provided an
overview/description of the theory) were not included.
(2) Intervention articles were defined as those that stated in their methods that they
used theory to inform the development and/or evaluation of an intervention aimedat changing behaviour and that included a measure of behaviour as an outcome.We focused on behaviour as the end-point rather than the consequence of thebehaviour (e.g., weight loss) because there are a number of factors further alongthe causal chain that could affect the link between behaviour and outcome
(Hardeman et al., 2005 ).
(3) Evaluative articles were defined as those reporting studies that empirically tested
a theory longitudinally.
(4) Review articles were defined as those that systematically reviewed a theory in
relation to a change in behavioural outcomes. Narrative reviews or selectiveoverviews of the literature (i.e., those without a description of a search strategyand no clear methodology that could be reproduced independently) were notincluded.
Articles were excluded if they: focused on cognition (e.g., intention to change behaviour)
rather than actual behaviour; were restricted to research participation behaviours, animalstudies, scale development, measurement or programme development, cost-effectiveness8 R. Davis et al.
Downloaded by [179.180.195.73] at 05:18 31 August 2015 

or single case studies; focused on mental health including therapeutic interventions where
cognitive or emotional variables were the primary outcome. Dissertations and doctoraltheses, books and book reviews, conference posters and presentations, editorials andcommentaries were excluded for practical reasons to limit the volume of material to be
retrieved and reviewed to manageable proportions. Articles that used multiple theories to
inform their methodology were excluded because our review was of the empiricalapplication of individual theories to changing behaviour.
We did not exclude articles based on their quality, since the methodology of applying
these criteria has yet to be developed.
Inter-rater reliability
Articles were screened for relevance at abstract and full-text stage by the lead author
(Rachel Davis). At both screening stages, 30% of the abstracts were independentlyscreened by two other researchers (each of which screened 15%) and inter-rater reliability
(calculated using percentage agreement) was assessed. Since the data constitute
unbalanced cells, we have used percentage agreement as it provides a more transparentand more readily interpretable parameter than Cohen ’s kappa. As kappa corrects for
chance agreement among multiple coders, use of kappa is likely to underestimatereliability (Steinijans, Diletti, Bomches, Greis, & Solleder, 1997 ). Differences of views
about inclusion were resolved through discussion and consensus with the other authors.
Data extraction
Data were extracted on: (i) country where the research took place, (ii) theory used, (iii)
type of article (descriptive, intervention, evaluative or review), (iv) design (quantitative,qualitative or mixed methods), (v) target behaviour (e.g., smoking, physical activity), (vi)target direction of behaviour [i.e., increase (which also included maintaining behaviour)
or decrease in uptake] and (vii) measurement of behaviour (self-report, objective or both).
Dual data extraction was conducted independently on 60% of the included papers by tworesearchers and inconsistencies resolved through joint discussion.
Quality assessment criteria
We reviewed key literature which synthesised scientific and philosophical perspectives on
what makes a theory scientific and useful for the purpose of effecting healthy behaviourchange in a target population (e.g., Glanz & Rimer, 1997 ; West, 2006 ) and used this to
draft an initial list of quality criteria. These were considered by the advisory group in botha face-to-face discussion and a subsequent electronic Delphi-like consultation aimed atachieving consensus.
Results
We report the theories of behaviour and behaviour change identified in our review and
the agreed criteria for assessing theory quality. A high-level summary of the keycharacteristics of the review articles is also provided.
Inter-rater reliability
A high level of agreement was observed for decisions on inclusion in relation to both the
theories and the articles included in the review (>90%).Health Psychology Review 9

Theories identified
Eighty-two theories of behaviour and behaviour change were identified. These are listed
inTable 1 along with the lead author, date of the paper that originally described the
theory and the number of articles that reported using the theory. Fifty-nine (out of the 82theories) were applied in the articles included in our review. The remaining theories ( N=
23) were identified by the advisory group and/or through abstracts of the articles retrievedin our literature search. In other words, these were theories that met our inclusion criteriabut did not have relevant articles retrieved from our search strategy that met our articleinclusion criteria, i.e., articles did not fall within one of our four categories (descriptive,
intervention, evaluative, review). Theories identified through our search that were
excluded, with reasons for exclusion, can be found in the online supplemental material(Supplemental Table 1 ).
It is important to note here that while our intention was to provide a list of potentially
relevant theories across different disciplines, it was not possible to categorise the theories
according to disciplines. Many of the theories had influences from more than one
discipline and/or authors were from several disciplines or could not be categorised intoany one discipline.
Quality assessment criteria
Nine defining features were identified as conceptually important for a good theory:
(i) clarity of constructs –‘Has the case been made for the independence of constructs
from each other? ’(ii) clarity of relationships between constructs –‘Are the relationships
between constructs clearly specified? ’(iii) measurability –‘Is an explicit methodology for
measuring the constructs given? ’(iv) testability –‘Has the theory been specified in such a
way that it can be tested? ’(v) being explanatory –‘Has the theory been used to explain/
account for a set of observations? (statistically or logically) ’; (vi) describing causality –
‘Has the theory been used to describe mechanisms of change? ’(vii) achieving
parsimony –‘Has the case for parsimony been made? ’(viii) generalisablity –‘Have
generalisations been investigated across ’: (a) behaviours? (b) populations? (c) contexts? ’
and (ix) having an evidence base.
Articles retrieved
In the results sections that follow we briefly summarise the main findings of the articles
included in our review. Further examination of the empirical application of these theoriesusing our quality assessment criteria is part of the future research programme.
Of 8680 articles retrieved through the database search, 6620 were excluded at the first
stage of screening (title and abstract) and 1804 articles (out of the remaining 2060) wereexcluded after full-text screening, leaving 256 articles. To these a further 20 articles wereadded through searching the reference lists of the included articles, resulting in 276articles. Figure 1 displays a flow chart of the search results.
Article characteristics
Articles were published between 1977 and 2012, with most of the research conducted in
Europe and North America. Eighteen categories of behaviours were identified, with threeaccounting for 50% of the articles: increasing physical activity ( N= 72; 26%), safe sex
practices ( N= 36; 13%) and smoking cessation ( N= 30; 11%). Fifty-two (19%) articles
addressed multiple health-related behaviours, with 17 (6%) of these targeting healthy10 R. Davis et al.

eating and physical activity together. The remaining categories comprised behaviours
relating to: healthy eating ( N= 13), addictive behaviours including alcohol and drugs
(N= 12), health examinations and tests ( N= 11), environmental conservation ( N= 10),
violence and delinquency ( N= 9), sun protection ( N= 9), drug adherence ( N= 5), job- or
education-related activities ( N= 4), Internet- or other technology-related behaviours ( N=
4), health care professional adherence to health care guidelines ( N= 3), financial-related
activities ( N= 2), speeding ( N= 2) and 2 ‘others ’which were behaviours that did not fall
into any of the above categories including pet removal from domestic residence ( N=1 )
and repairing mosquito nets ( N= 1).
The majority of articles used quantitative methods ( N= 243; 88%) and most reported
interventions ( N= 168; 61%) or were evaluative ( N= 62; 35%). Thirty-one descriptive
articles (either primary theory sources or extensions of a theory) were identified.Behaviour was most commonly measured by self-report methods ( N= 194; 70%). For a
high-level summary of these key characteristics, please refer to Table 2 ; a more detailed
account of each individual article can be found online in Supplemental Table 2 .
Papers published by the same first author and focused on the same theory were
assessed to identify cases in which multiple articles based on the same intervention (i.e.,intervention protocol and outcomes) or data-set had been published. This was found to bethe case for 19 articles in total (covering 9 interventions/data-sets; see Tables 1 and2).
Frequency of use
Of the 82 theories identified, just 4 theories accounted for 174 (63%) of articles: the
Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM; N= 91; 33%), the Theory of Planned
Behaviour (TPB; N= 36; 13%), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; N= 29; 11%) and the
Information-Motivation-Behavioural-Skills Model (IMB; N= 18; 7%). A further four
theories accounted for an additional 32 (12%) of the included articles: the HBM ( N=9 ;
3%), Self-determination Theory (SDT; N= 9; 3%), Health Action Process Approach
(HAPA; N= 8; 3%) and Social Learning Theory (SLT; N= 6; 2%; SLT is a precursor of
SCT). The remaining theories ( N= 70) were applied fewer than 6 times each in the
literature that met our inclusion criteria, with most only being applied once or twice (seeTable 1 ).Table 1 ( Continued )

Discussion
This scoping review of theories of behaviour/behaviour change of potential relevance to
designing and evaluating public health interventions was informed by the disciplines of
psychology, sociology, anthropology and economics. Eighty-two theories were identifiedthat spanned a myriad of behaviours and could be applied to designing and evaluatinginterventions to improve public health, as well as tackle other social issues such asenvironmental sustainability and public safety.
It is important to note that the literature identified in the scoping review reflects the
search strategy that aimed to identify theories rather than exhaustively review theoret-ically informed empirical studies. Therefore, whilst the review identified articles that usethe theories in relation to our inclusion criteria, it does not reflect the wider application ofthese theories to public health-related research.
Scoping reviews are used to map or configure a body of evidence. They therefore
tend to focus on breadth, including studies that are representative of the variation withinthe evidence base, rather than focusing on depth and assembling all the eligible material.It can also mean that establishing what the boundaries of the review are, and thereforewhat should be included or excluded, may be refined during the course of the review(Shemilt et al., 2013 ). Consensus methods can help with this process. While we intended
to conduct this review in a systematic and reproducible way, as it was the first attemptthat we were aware of to review a bodies of theory in this way, its purpose seemed moreakin to that of a scoping than a systematic review. As Gough, Thomas, and Oliver ( 2012 )
have suggested, there is a clear distinction between aggregative systematic reviews thatare‘about seeking evidence to inform decisions ’and configurative scoping reviews
which are about ‘seeking concepts to provide enlightenment through new ways of
understanding ’. Arguably what we wanted to attempt was a combination of these two
things but we have nevertheless labelled what we did a scoping review.
From the theories we identified, only a few were frequently applied in literature.
While the purpose of our scoping review was not to uncover all the relevant literature onhow these theories have been applied, the finding is of interest because it is consistentwith other reviews and publications (e.g., Glanz & Bishop, 2010 ; Painter et al., 2008 ;
Prestwich et al., 2013 ). Sixty-three per cent of the articles identified in the review related
to just four theories: the TTM, TPB, SCT and the IMB Skills Model. While the literaturewe uncovered was limited by our inclusion criteria, and includes a small number cases inwhich authors have published more than one article applying the same theory to the samedata-set or intervention, it indicates the very uneven distribution of frequency of theoryuse. This raises the question as to why many theories are so little used. One explanationmay be that how often a theory is used, could in part, be confounded by the year in whichthe theory was introduced. Knowledge of a theory in terms of how much it is discussed inthe public domain is also likely to play a role. Another explanation might be that thosethat are used more frequently are ‘better ’theories and selected for use because they have
a stronger evidence base or meet other quality criteria. However, a couple of examplessuggest that frequency does not necessarily follow quality. For example, the theoryappearing most frequently in our review, the TTM, has been criticised on several grounds
(West, 2005 ) and its empirical support has been questioned by systematic review findings
(e.g., Cahill, Lancaster, & Green, 2010 ; Etter & Perneger, 1999 ; Littell & Girvin, 2002 ;
Whitelaw, Baldwin, Bunton, & Flynn, 2000 ). On the other hand, recent meta-regression
evidence has shown good support for Control Theory (Dombrowski et al., 2012 ; IversHealth Psychology Review 15
Downloaded by [179.180.195.73] at 05:18 31 August 2015 

et al., 2012 ; Michie et al., 2009 ); however, this was identified in only one article in our
review. Another explanation is that people are not aware of the full range of theories fromwhich to choose and so instead opt for those most commonly applied in the literature.Frequency of use may not reflect perceived quality of the theory but instead, fashion,familiarity, prior training, exposure or incentivisation. We hope that this review will help
to increase awareness among intervention designers and researchers about the range of
theories available. We report nine criteria agreed as markers of theory quality that couldaid selection of the most appropriate theory or theories.
Our decision to focus on theories of behaviour change at the level of the individual
and exclude theories concerned with group behaviour is likely to be part of the
explanation for the preponderance of psychological theories identified in the review,although even interventions at the community level tend to be informed by psychologicalor social –psychological theories (e.g., Bonell, Fletcher, et al., 2013 ; Bonell, Jamal, et al.,
2013 ; Glanz & Bishop, 2010 ; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2007 ).
This, and the decision not to include books where sociological and anthropologicaltheories are more likely to be found, may go some way to explaining why these types oftheory are under-represented. In addition, Kelly et al. ( 2010 ) found that sociological
theories were missed in electronic searches, particularly if they were more than 25 years
old. Given that interventions may be improved by drawing on theories specificallytargeting group behaviours, this would be a useful focus for a future literature review aswe are not aware of there being such a review.
This review raised the issues as to what constitutes ‘a theory ’and‘ab e h a v i o u r ’. Theories,
as conceptualised here, ranged from quite specific (e.g., to a particular behavioural domain ortype of intervention) to very gene ral, including multiple levels of influence. The cut-offs at
either end of this spectrum were agreed by consensus but were inevitably arbitrary. A generalobservation was that more general theories may have greater face validity but be less useablein guiding research than more specific theori es; choice of theory will therefore be partly
guided by the purpose it is to be put to. Another observation was that there appeared to be no
generally accepted use of terms such as theory, model, framework and orientation, with
different uses by different authors. Increasing the precision of, and consensus on, use ofterminology would be he lpful for the field.
‘Behaviour ’also varies in level of specificity: for example, physical activity includes
sports which includes volleyball which includes running. Behaviours are also part of
sequences, often dependent on previous behaviours (e.g., carrying gym kit) andsometimes on other people ’s behaviours (e.g., others turning up for a team game). Just
as the relevance of a particular theory may vary across type of behaviour, so it may varyaccording to the level of specificity.
The review also suggests that there are a large number of theories that are of potential
use in designing public health interventions. The cataloguing of 83 theories of behaviourchange is an important resource for researchers wishing to draw on theories beyond thefew that currently dominate the literature. However, few of these theories have beensubjected to wide-scale rigorous empirical evaluation. There have been calls for moreoperationalization, application, testing and refining of theories over many years (e.g.,
Michie & Johnston, 2012 ; Noar & Zimmerman, 2005 ; Rothman, 2004 ; Weinstein, 2007 ;
Weinstein & Rothman, 2005 ), but advances are slow. We need more investment into
methodological and substantive research in this area, for example, the use of fractionatedfactorial (Collins et al., 2011) and n-of-1 (Johnston, Jones, Charles, McCann, & McKee,16 R. Davis et al.
Downloaded by [179.180.195.73] at 05:18 31 August 2015 

2013 ) designs to tease apart complex interventions and the extent to which theories can
be generalised across populations, behaviours and contexts.
Identifying the theories in this review is just the first step in a much larger and
ongoing programme of work aimed at improving the use of appropriate theory and thescientific rigour with which it is applied. Future work will investigate the ways in whichtheories have been operationalised and the extent to which different theories share
constructs and can be seen as ‘families ’of theory. Transforming the nine quality criteria
into forms, such as reliable scales or response options that can be used in evaluatingtheories is a complex task, and a study in its own right. The evolution of theories overtime, including the issue of when a theory is considered a new theory, will also be
examined. Many theories contained similar constructs or the same constructs but with
slightly different names. Understanding these similarities and working towards a commonset of terminology would facilitate the building of a cumulative understanding ofmechanisms of action from both primary research and evidence syntheses. It would also
further our understanding of the evolution of theories and how theories have been revised
and/or integrated with other theories over time. Having said this, it is also important torecognise that not only language varies across and within disciplines but so doepistemological and ontological assumptions and preoccupations.
The next phase of the current research is to (i) investigate the connectedness of
theories with each other and (ii) operationalize and demonstrate the application of the
agreed quality criteria. These will both inform the understanding of theory and its
development, and help guide researchers, policy-makers and interventions on theappropriate selection and application behaviour change theories to developing publichealth and other behaviour change interventions.
