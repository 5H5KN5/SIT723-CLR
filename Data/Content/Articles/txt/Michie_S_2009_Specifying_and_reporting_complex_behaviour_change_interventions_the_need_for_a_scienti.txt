Abstract
Complex behaviour change interventions are not we ll described; when they are described, the
terminology used is inconsistent. This constrains scientific replic ation, and limits  the subsequent
introduction of successful interventions. Implementation Science is introducing a policy of initially
encouraging and subsequently requiring the scie ntific reporting of complex behaviour change
interventions.
The current state of affairs
Progress in tackling today's major health and healthcare
problems requires changes in behaviour [1,2]. Population
health can be improved by changing behaviour in those
who are at risk from ill health, in those with a chronic or
acute illness, and in health professionals and others
responsible for delivering effective, evidence-based public
health and healthcare. In the field of implementation
research, thousands of studies have developed and evalu-
ated interventions aimed at bringing the behavior of
healthcare professionals into line with evidence-based
practice. Systematic reviews of behaviour change interven-
tions have tended to find modest and worthwhile effects
but no clear pattern of results favouring any one particular
method. Where effects are found, it is often unclear what
behaviour change processes are responsible for observed
changes. If effective interventions to change behaviours
are to be delivered to influence outcomes at population,
community, organisational or individual levels [3], the
field must produce greater clarity about the functionalcomponents of those interventions. These should then be
matched to population, setting, and other contextual
characteristics [4].
What is the problem?
Interventions aren't described
Few published intervention evaluations refer to formal
documentation describing the content and delivery of an
intervention and are seldom reported by researchers or
practitioners in enough detail to replicate them [5,6].
Reviews of nearly 1,000 behaviour change outcome stud-
ies [7-10] found that interventions were described in
detail in only 5% to 30% of the experimental studies.
Even when the intervention was documented ( e.g., a
detailed manual was available), only a few investigators
actually measured the presence or strength of the interven-
tion in practice, and fewer still included such measures in
the analyses of the results. Thus, we are often left knowing
very little about the details of an intervention or the func-
tional relationship between the components of the inter-Published: 16 July 2009

functional relationships are critical to any future introduc-
tion and scale-up of effective interventions. This knowl-
edge helps to inform what to teach to new practitioners,
how to transform or reorganise healthcare processes, and
what to include in the assessment of practitioner perform-
ance (fidelity measures)–all key features of successful
implementation [11,12].
For those studies that do provide a detailed account of the
intervention, there is inconsistent use of terminology that
limits meta-analyses and contributions to science. For
example, 'behavioural counselling', 'academic detailing',
and 'outreach' can mean very different things according to
the group delivering or evaluating the intervention, leav-
ing potential users confused. Having consistent terminol-
ogy and sufficient information for replication appears to
be more problematic for behavioural and organisational
interventions than for pharmacological ones. Twenty-six
multidisciplinary researchers attending a workshop were
presented with a set of behavioural or pharmacological
intervention protocols, and asked whether they had suffi-
cient information to be able to deliver them in practice
settings. They were less confident about being able to rep-
licate behavioural interventions compared with pharma-
cological interventions (t = 6.45, p < 0.0001) and judged
that they would need more information in order to repli-
cate behavioural interventions (U = 35.5, p = 0.022) [13].
A more detailed protocol description of the intervention
did not increase confidence, suggesting that, in this situa-
tion at least, more information does not, per se , make
intervention descriptions easier to interpret and to use for
replication.
The lack of attention to providing useful descriptions of
behavioural interventions may in part reflect the low
investment in this area of research (compared to the
investment in pharmacological research); it also may
reflect limitations in current scientific practice. Interven-
tion development methods and content are often based
on simple, mostly unstated models of human behaviour
or, at best, are 'informed' by theory using methods that are
tenuous and intuitive rather than systematic [14,15]. This
means that each new intervention and each new evalua-
tion occurs in relative isolation, and the opportunity to
build an incrementally improving 'technology' of behav-
iour change is constrained. If a more explicitly theoretical
approach to deciding how to design and report interven-
tions were taken, it may be that more effects may be
revealed and more understanding of their functional
mechanisms gleaned. Arguably, better reporting of inter-
ventions that are poorly (and implicitly) conceptualised
will not improve the situation. Advantages of using
explicit rather than implicit theoretical models include
providing a consistent and generalisable frameworkwithin which to gather evidence; promoting the under-
standing of causal mechanisms that both enrich theory
and facilitate the development of more effective interven-
tions [16]; and suggestimg moderating variables that
would guide the user in adapting the intervention to dif-
ferent patients or population subgroups [4,17]. The extent
to which this advantage is realised will depend on the
development of more sophisticated methods of applying
theory to intervention design and evaluation [18].
The advantages of report ing interventions better
To implement interventions to provide benefits to the
intended populations, the functional components of
interventions must be known and clearly described. For
example, in pharmacology the active ingredient of aspirin
is very different from the active ingredient of statins, and
each is known to impact on physiological and pathologi-
cal outcomes in different ways. To accumulate evidence of
outcome effectiveness and of processes of behavioural
change, accurate replication of such interventions across
multiple studies is required. An analysis of 49 highly cited
clinical research studies found that, of 45 claimed to be
effective, only 20 (44%) had their findings replicated by
subsequent research [19]. Replication requires accurate
and detailed reporting of the interventions. Such replica-
tion generates scientific knowledge, allows unhelpful or
even harmful interventions to be avoided, and provides
the detail that allows effective interventions to be subse-
quently introduced and scaled up to provide population
benefits. There is evidence that the more clearly the effec-
tive core components of an intervention are known and
defined, the more readily the program or practice can be
introduced successfully [20-22]. The core intervention
components are, by definition, essential to achieving
good outcomes for those targeted by the intervention.
This is as true for modes of delivery and intervention set-
tings as it is for intervention content. As a simple example,
a core component of Multi-systemic Therapy (MST),
Homebuilders, and Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP)
interventions is that they are delivered in the homes of
children [23-25]. It is not MST, Homebuilders, or NFP
unless this fundamental feature is present. However, in a
large scale attempt to replicate Homebuilders across the
United States, many of the replication sites delivered serv-
ices in their offices, not family homes and, predictably,
the outcomes were disappointing [26]. The philosophy
and values of Homebuilders were adopted, but the core
intervention components were not used. Thus, the speci-
fication of effective core intervention components
becomes very important to the process of the subsequent
introduction of innovations on a scale useful to society
and to their evaluation in practice ( e.g., [4,27,28]).
Knowing the effective core intervention components may
allow for more efficient and cost effective introduction of
Implementation Science  2009, 4:40 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/40
Page 3 of 6
(page number not for citation purposes)interventions and lead to confident decisions about the
non-core components that can be adapted to suit local
conditions at a local site. Not knowing the effective core
intervention components leads to time and resources
wasted in attempting to introduce a variety of non-func-
tional elements. Clear descriptions of core components
allow for evaluations of the functions of those procedures.
Some specific procedures and sub-components may be
difficult and costly to evaluate using randomised group
designs ( e.g., [29]), but within-person or within-organisa-
tion research designs offer an efficient way to experimen-
tally determine the function of individual components of
evidence-based practices and programs [18,30-34]. For
those interventions that are supported by a series of rand-
omized controlled trials (RCTs) that are theoretically and
methodologically consistent across studies, Bloom has
suggested meta-analytic strategies to take advantage of
naturally-occurring variations in RCTs to discern effective
components of interventions for different types of partic-
ipant and setting. Of course, as with any meta-analysis,
the results depend on having investigators 'guess right'
about the core components for which measures are
included.
Current reporting guidelines
Guidelines for researchers to improve the transparent and
accurate reporting of interventions in health research are
summarized on the EQUATOR Network website http://
www.equator-network.org . They include the well-estab-
lished CONSORT guidelines for reporting evaluation tri-
als, which suggest that evaluators should report 'precise
details of interventions [as] actually administered' [35].
The extension of these guidelines to non-pharmacological
trials [36], the TREND Statement for the transparent
reporting of evaluations with non-randomised designs
[37] and the STROBE Statement for strengthening the
reporting of observational studies [38] all call for inter-
vention content to be described, as do the SQUIRE guide-
lines for quality improvement reporting [39,40].
However, it is only recently that attention has begun to be
paid, by groups such as the Workgroup for Intervention
Development and Evaluation Research (WIDER), to what,
or how to, report intervention content and components.
Their current recommendations to improve reporting of
the content of behaviour change interventions are availa-
ble at http://interventiondesign.co.uk .
The relationship between post-hoc and ante-hoc 
description
The reporting guidelines cited above are intended to be
used as a post-hoc set of descriptors. However, in order to
maximise the scientific advantages inherent in better
description, we argue that there needs to be an 'ante-hoc'
process that informs the building of the intervention in
the first place. This is consistent with the increasing prac-tice of researchers involved in healthcare implementation
studies to describe study and intervention protocols in
BMC journals such as Implementation Science ; because
there is no formal space limit, intervention materials such
as leaflets, brochures, websites, and training schedules can
be easily included using facilities such as Additional Files.
Future developments
An overall framework for describing important elements of 
an intervention
Advances in intervention reporting will require greater
clarity about both what to report and how to report. Eight
characteristics have been identified as essential descriptors
in relation to public health interventions [41]: the content
or elements of the intervention (techniques), characteris-
tics of those delivering the intervention, characteristics of
the recipients, characteristics of the setting ( e.g., worksite),
the mode of delivery ( e.g., face-to-face), the intensity ( e.g.,
contact time), the duration ( e.g., number sessions over a
given period), and adherence to delivery protocols.
Adherence is not a characteristic of interventions per se ,
and is outside the focus of this paper, as are indicators of
generalisation, such as the RE-AIM elements of reach,
effectiveness/efficacy, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance http://www.re-aim.org [4]). Work towards
defining characteristics of intervention designed to
improve professional practice and the delivery of effective
health services has begun by the Cochrane Effective Prac-
tice and Organisation of Care Group http://
www.epoc.cochrane.org . It covers a wide range of charac-
teristics, e.g., evidence base, purpose, nature of desired
change, format, deliverer, frequency/number of interven-
tion events, duration, and setting. However, neither
framework provides a method of reporting intervention
content, i.e., the component techniques.
Work in the UK has begun to construct a nomenclature of
behaviour change techniques. Using inductive and con-
sensus methods, systematic reviews of behaviour change
interventions and relevant textbooks have been analysed
[14,42]. This has generated a list of 137 separately defined
techniques representing different levels of complexity and
generality [13], and a 26-item list of techniques demon-
strating good inter-rater reliability across raters and behav-
ioural domains [42]. The latter, along with a coding
manual of definitions, was inductively generated from
systematic reviews of interventions (84 comparisons)
using behavioural and/or cognitive techniques, some in
combination with social and/or environmental and pol-
icy change strategies.
This nomenclature has been used to code interventions in
a systematic review of interventions to increase physical
activity and healthy eating [43]. This demonstrated that
the interventions comprised, on average, six techniques
Implementation Science  2009, 4:40 http://www.implementation science.com/content/4/1/40
Page 4 of 6
(page number not for citation purposes)(ranging from one to 14). By combining this analysis with
meta-regression, it is possible to analyse the effects of
individual techniques and technique combinations
within these mainly multifaceted interventions. Using
this method, interventions that combined self-monitor-
ing with at least one other technique derived from control
theory were significantly more effective than the other
interventions, an effect that would have been missed
using traditional meta-analyses. A similar approach has
been used by Chorpita, Daleiden, and Weisz [44] to code
and catalogue common features of evidence-based behav-
ioral interventions. These features should include recipi-
ents (demographics), setting, mode of delivery, and key
targets ( e.g., knowledge, skills, and attitudes). This would
represent a significant advance on analysing the overall
effect size of heterogeneous interventions.
An agreed set of terms
Because different labels can be used for the same interven-
tion technique, and different techniques may be referred
to by the same label, it is imperative that there be a con-
sensual, common language to describe an agreed list of
techniques. Just as medicines are described in detail in the
British National Formulary (BNF), we need a parsimoni-
ous list (nomenclature) of conceptually distinct and
defined techniques, with labels that can be reliably used
in reporting interventions across discipline and country.
This was seen as an important tool for describing interven-
tions (mean rating 4.4 on a scale of zero to five, with five
most relevant to needs) in the workshop reported above
[13].
The role of theory
In addition to establishing the core components ('active
ingredients') of interventions, progress in developing
effective interventions requires an understanding of how
interventions work, that is, the mechanisms by which
interventions cause behaviour change [45]. This requires
clear links between defined intervention techniques and
theoretical mechanisms of change. There is increasing rec-
ognition that the design of behaviour change interven-
tions should be based on relevant theories [4,16,17,46].
This is partly because such interventions are more likely to
contribute to the science of behaviour. Using theory to
identify constructs (key concepts in the theory) that are
causally related to behaviour, and are therefore appropri-
ate targets for the intervention, can confer a range of ben-
efits including potentially stronger effects [47-49].
Use of theory also leads to evaluations that are more use-
ful in developing theoretical understanding. In the UK,
the Medical Research Council's framework for developing
and evaluating complex interventions placed theory cen-
trally within the process of intervention evaluation [50].
The usefulness of using theory depends on ensuring that
techniques are linked directly to the hypothesized causalprocess that accounts for change. This allows theory to be
used to design interventions and evaluations of interven-
tions to be used to develop theory. Next steps in this area
of work are to validate and refine the nomenclature of
techniques, and identify underlying theoretical principles
to produce a taxonomy with a hierarchically organised
internal structure.
Conclusion
The scientific reporting of complex behaviour change
interventions is an idea whose time has come; there is
simply no reason not to do this. Journals' space con-
straints have often limited the publication of detailed
descriptions of interventions. However, with the advent of
Open Access publishing and the possibility of publishing
supplementary material on the web, journals should now
require a detailed intervention protocol to be made avail-
able as a pre-requisite to the publication of a report of an
intervention evaluation. The only argument against this is
a commercial one, the desire for some researchers to earn
money directly from their research activity. Copyright and
intellectual property rights are put forward as reasons for
not publishing details of their intervention protocols and
manuals. This is an ethical and political issue for the sci-
entific community. Do we want to put science first, with
all the benefits it will accrue for humanity, or do we want
to go down the road of the pharmacological industry,
putting profit before health benefits? The development of
the World Wide Web could have become a commercial
enterprise, benefitting corporations above the scientific
community. Due largely to the ethical principles of its cre-
ator, Tim Berners-Lee, the web has been retained for the
benefit of the public in the face of considerable corporate
pressure. It is our hope that the behavioural science com-
munity will collectively value public health over private
profit, and co-ordinate their efforts to achieve this.
We welcome Implementation Science 's new policy (Appen-
dix) of requiring authors to make, or to have made, avail-
able intervention protocols when submitting intervention
studies and to report interventions, guided by Davidson et
al.'s characteristics (see above) and based on the WIDER
Recommendations to Improve Reporting of the Content
of Behaviour Change Interventions http://interventionde
sign.co.uk . We also welcome the advice to authors to iden-
tify in protocols what they think are prototypical/core ele-
ments of interventions, hypothesised mediating
mechanisms, and potential moderators. The editorial pol-
icy of Implementation Science is one step in this direction;
seeking agreement from other journals to introduce simi-
lar policies will be essential to the strengthening of our sci-
ence and enhancing the impact of its findings.

Appendix
Implementation Science editorial policy on describing 
the content of complex interventions
In order to achieve the benefits discussed in this editorial,
authors submitting to Implementation Science will be
required to provide detailed descriptions of the interven-
tions delivered in their studies.
These are the WIDER Recommendations to Improve
Reporting of the Content of Behaviour Change Interven-
tions http://interventiondesign.co.uk/
1. Detailed description of in terventions in published papers
Authors describing behaviour change intervention (BCI)
evaluations should describe: 1) characteristics of those
delivering the intervention, 2) characteristics of the recip-
ients (and see Noguchi et al., 2007, for unusual but impor-
tantly informative detail on participants before and after
attrition), 3) the setting ( e.g., worksite, time, and place of
intervention), 4) the mode of delivery ( e.g., face-to-face),
5) the intensity ( e.g., contact time), 6) the duration ( e.g.,
number of sessions and their spacing over a given period),
7) adherence/fidelity to delivery protocols, and 8) a
detailed description of the intervention content provided
for each study group.
2. Clarification of assumed chan ge process and design principles
Authors describing BCI evaluations should describe: 1)
the intervention development, 2) the change techniques
used in the intervention, and 3) the causal processes tar-
geted by these change techniques; all in as much detail as
is possible, unless these details are already readily availa-
ble (e.g., in a prior publication).
3. Access to interventi on manuals/protocols
At the time of publishing a BCI evaluation report, editors
will ask authors to submit protocols or manuals describ-
ing BCI evaluations or, alternatively, specify where manu-
als can be easily and reliably accessed by readers. Such
supplementary materials can be made accessible online.
4. Detailed description of  active control conditions
Authors describing BCI evaluations should describe the
content of active control groups in as much detail as is
possible ( e.g., the techniques used) in a similar manner to
the description of the content of the intervention itself.From 2009 authors will be strongly encouraged to pro-
vide this information; from 2011 they will be required
to provide it
