The dynamic sustainability framework: addressing
the paradox of sustainment amid ongoing change
David A Chambers1*, Russell E Glasgow2and Kurt C Stange3
Abstract
Background: Despite growth in implementation research, limited scientific attention has focused on understanding
and improving sustainability of health interventions. Models of sustainability have been evolving to reflect
challenges in the fit between intervention and context.
Discussion: We examine the development of concepts of sustaina bility, and respond to two frequent assumptions —
‘voltage drop, ’whereby interventions are expected to yield lower ben efits as they move from eff icacy to effectiveness to
implementation and sustainability, and ‘program drift, ’whereby deviation from manua lized protocols is assumed to
decrease benefit. We posit that these assumptions limit opportunities to improve care, and instead argue for
understanding the changing context of healthcare to continuo usly refine and improve interv entions as they are sustained.
Sustainability has evolved from being considered as the e ndgame of a translational research process to a suggested
‘adaptation phase ’that integrates and institutionalizes intervention s within local organizational and cultural contexts.
These recent approaches locate sustainability in the implemen tation phase of knowledge transfer, but still do not address
intervention improvement as a central theme. We propose a D ynamic Sustainability Framewo rk that involves: continued
learning and problem solving, ongoing adaptation of interv entions with a primary focus on fit between interventions and
multi-level contexts, and expectations for ongoing impr ovement as opposed to diminishing outcomes over time.
Summary: A Dynamic Sustainability Framework provides a founda tion for research, policy a nd practice that supports
development and testing of falsifiable hy potheses and continued learning to advanc e the implementation, transportability
and impact of health services research.

Background
As implementation science has grown [1,2], researchers
have advanced from study of facilitators and barriers
that influence uptake of effective programs and policies
to investigations of strategies to improve uptake. How-
ever, often studies evaluate only initial intervention adop-
tion and implementation. Sustained practice change and
broader scale-up of interventions [3] rarely are investi-
gated, often due to the constrained timeframes for research
that are set by grant mechanisms, and the budgetary and
political necessity of many decision-makers to take on a
short-term lens.
Recently, there has been interest in understanding and
influencing the sustainability of implemented interventions.W h i l et h i si sp r o g r e s s ,f r e q u e ntly used conceptualizations
of sustainability implicitly replicate assumptions and
limitations inherent in the trad itional research-to-practice
pathway [4,5], or in its more recent conceptualization
as translational research [6]. These conceptualizations of
knowledge translation often assume that interventions are
optimized prior to implementa tion, and that they are largely
independent of the context in which they are delivered [7].
The presumed linear model of intervention develop-
ment, efficacy testing and implementation has resulted
in the development of an armamentarium of efficacious
healthcare treatments, preventive strategies, and public
health interventions. While these discoveries have made
advances in a number of health domains, they are often
difficult to implement in a myriad of practice settings
and even harder to sustain over time and in many real
world and low-resource settings [8]. In addition, inter-
ventions are traditionally expected to perform worse in* Correspondence: dchamber@mail.nih.gov

real-world practice than in the laboratory or the rarified
clinical trial setting. We argue for a new approach to
sustainability that instead integrates the themes of adap-tive, contextually sensitive continuous quality improve-
ment (CQI) and a learning healthcare system with the
challenge of intervention sustainment.
The purposes of this article are to explicate:
1. Evolving understandings of sustainability and of
related concepts of CQI and the learning
healthcare system;
2. An iterative, dynamic approach to sustainability,
termed the ‘Dynamic Sustainability Framework ’(DSF)
that integrates and extends these concepts; and
3. Implications of this framework for research, policy,
and practice.
Given the variation with which terms central to dis-
semination and implementation research can be used,
we include a table that lays out working definitions for
the central terms of this debate Table 1.
Moving beyond ‘voltage drop ’and ‘program drift
While the traditional linear process of intervention deve-
lopment, derived from pharmaceutical medication deve-
lopment models [13], has often resulted in the creation ofinitially successful interventions, it may be less helpful in
enabling these innovations to maximally benefit health. A
linear approach may be particularly challenging to applyto complex, multi-component interventions, psychosocial
treatments, treatment of the growing number of people
with multimorbid conditions [14,15], and systemic ap-proaches to care [15]. Linear approaches place a premium
on creating and ‘freezing ’an intervention, developingmanuals to ensure its consistent delivery with fidelity [16],
and then minimizing deviations from the intervention. For
example, the COMMIT stop smoking national project hadexpert researchers design the complex, lengthy interven-
tion protocol based on research evidence, and then gave a
several hundred page manual of operations to local staffto implement in their communities [17].
The importance of internal validity to the scientific pro-
cess should not be ignored, but its overemphasis relative togeneralizability and adaptation runs the risk of creating
interventions that will not fit within different, complex or
changing settings and of failing to benefit settings, clini-cians, and patient populations who are underrepresented in
the intervention testing pro cess [7,16]. Two key implicit
assumptions within the traditional intervention develop-ment approach may limit ultimate progress toward inter-
vention sustainability and population impact:
First, interventions are often developed with the idea
that they can be optimally constructed, manualized, and
then tested in a single form applicable across settings
and over time. Efficacy trials are designed to screen outnoise in the system (patient co morbidities, competing de-
mands and skill variance of clinicians, resource limitations,
varying motivations of patients) [7], and thus maximize out-comes. As interventions move to effectiveness and into
implementation, one expects that the individual benefit of
the intervention will likely drop, due to the added complex-ity of heterogeneous patients, providers and settings. This is
referred to as ‘voltage drop ’( F i g u r e1 ) .T h ea s s u m p t i o no f
‘voltage drop ’results in missed opportunities to refine and
improve the intervention, instead concluding that the de-
clining benefit is expected and acceptable, and the best pos-
sible outcome is that which is achieved at the efficacy stage.
Second, the assumption that interventions can be opti-
mally constructed in the early stages of the development
and testing process, independent of context, suggeststhat, even at the stages of implementation and sustain-
ability, change to the intervention is expected to have
negative consequences, and that the further a practi-tioner deviates from the manual, the lower the benefit.
This is the concept of ‘program drift ’(Figure 1). Delive-
ring the intervention within an efficacy trial may require
adherence to protocols that are challenging to deliver
within real-world practice. Fidelity ratings then assumethat 100% fidelity to original protocols will yield optimal
outcomes, and effort is expended to ensure that practi-
tioners do not deviate from the manual. Where clini-cians do deviate from the protocol, the field expects that
the resulting ‘program drift ’will compromise outcomes
[12]. We see that this over-reliance on quality assuranceto prevent ‘program drift ’leads to extensive pressure on
real-world practices to adhere to the intervention proto-
cols without evidence that this adherence will lead tooptimal outcomes. Quality assurance may inadvertentlyTable 1 Definitions of key terms used in this paper

hamper sustainability and ongoing improvement, cus-
tomization and optimization of interventions to the det-
riment of population health.
In contrast, we reject the notion that an intervention can
be optimized prior to implemen tation, and explicitly reject
the validity of ‘program drift ’and ‘voltage drop. ’Rather, we
suggest that the most compelling evidence on the maximal
benefit of any intervention can only be realized through
ongoing development, evaluation and refinement in diverse
populations and systems [18]. Instead of viewing contextual
factors as interfering with the delivery of an effective inter-
vention and needing to be controlled, we see the opportu-
nity to learn about the optimal fit of an intervention to
different care settings [2]. For example, strategies have been
developed to adjust organiz ational characteristics ( e.g., cul-
ture, climate, structure) to enable improved fit between the
intervention and the setting [19]; harnessing the under-
standing of context can enable beneficial adaptation of the
intervention and improve sustainability. Without rejecting
these assumptions, we reify early phase interventions tested
in the most artificial settings, set quality assurance of inter-
ventions as an optimal outcome, and miss opportunities
for continued learning and development.
Understanding and advancing sustainability research
As the field of implementation science has matured [20,21],
more emphasis has been placed on understanding sustain-
ability. Researchers have rec ognized that implementation
of interventions, which can often require substantial re-
sources, is meaningless witho ut successful long-term use.
Following Rabin et al. ’s glossary for Dissemination and
Implementation Research in Health [9], we draw dis-
tinctions between ‘implementation, ’which relates to theinitial process of embedding interventions within set-
tings and ‘sustainability, ’which relates to the extent that
these interventions can continue to be delivered over time,
institutionalized within settings, and have necessary ca-
pacity built to support their delivery.
Recent articles [22-24] have advanced the idea of an
adaptation phase that bridges from the initial implemen-
tation effort to a longer-term sustainability phase. They
argue the need to examine the fit between the practice
setting and the intervention and make changes necessary
to improve the integration of the intervention into on-
going care processes. This is consistent with the institu-
tional theory of organizations, which argues that the final
stage of innovation requires the ‘institutionalizing ’of the
new practice so that it becomes a working part of the
organization [25].
As a consequence, assessment of organizational cha-
racteristics ( e.g., structure, climate, culture, resources) is
seen as an essential component of sustainability, and in-
deed, the fit between context and the intervention is at
the center of a sustainability phase [24]. There has also
been an emphasis on planning for sustainability much
earlier in the intervention process [26]. Recent approaches
to sustainability locate key efforts squarely in the imple-
mentation phase, arguing that once a practice has been
implemented within a care system, those who manage the
delivery of that practice should turn their attention to
ensuring that the practice can be maintained over time
[6,24]. Authors typically suggest that this entails attention
to issues of long-term financing, training of the workforce,
supervision, and organizational support for the practice
[26,27]. A characteristic of this approach is to postpone
emphasis on sustainability until after implementation is

well underway, assuming that implementation and sus-
tainability are sufficiently independent.
Authors have also highlighted the utility of assessing
outcomes of those who have received the practice, some-
thing infrequently collected in routine practice [24,28].
Seldom is it demonstrated that continued delivery of anintervention confers benefit on the patient population
that receives the intervention or the system that delivers
it (e.g., cost containment, efficiency of care, quality met-
rics). Measurement of outcomes over time to determine
continued benefit has been shown to support sustain-
ability of the practice [29,30].
Recent implementation projects have created new
tools and scales to study sustainability, including needs
assessments, long-term action plans, tracking of pro-gram adaptation, financial planning, mapping of com-
munity networks, and measurement of the degree to
which practices are integrated and institutionalized intoservice systems [31-33]. While this emerging focus on
sustainability is an advance, many studies still assume a
largely static service delivery system that needs to beassessed only at key time points, but not in an ongoing
manner. To better reflect complexity and change within
the system and in context, a more dynamic approach tosustainability is needed.
Framework
The dynamic sustainability framework (DSF)
As Heraclitus observed, ‘The only constant is change. ’
The Dynamic Sustainability Framework has developedout of our evolving thinking and our collective experience
in conducting and advancing implementation science,where we have seen inattention to constant change limit
the ability to which implemented interventions are sus-
tained over time in complex clinical and community set-tings. The DSF (Figure 2) emphasizes that change exists in
the use of interventions over time, the characteristics of
practice settings, and the broader system that establishesthe context for how care is delivered. As classical thinking
eloquently captures, change impacts the ability of health
interventions to be optimally used and sustained overtime. This dynamism exists in the evidence base for inter-
ventions that links causal factors to health outcomes, as
judged by the continual stream of new publications in aca-demic journals that add to available evidence on the ef-
fectiveness of interventions, as well as ongoing practice
surveillance systems that capture intervention impact.Dynamism exists in the interventions that support the evi-
dence, which acknowledge ad hoc adaptation and experi-
mentation of evidence-based interventions. Furthermore,it exists in a constantly changing multi-level context [34],
internal to a clinical or community setting and the broader
care system, be it an organization, community, county,state or country.
The DSF, like many implementation models, centers
on a few major elements: the intervention, the contextin which the intervention is delivered, and the broader
ecological system within which the practice settings exist
and operate. Distinct from those models, however, is theconsideration of these elements over time. The interven-
tion, as shown in the figure, often includes a set of in-
dividual components chosen for their ability to effectbehavior or biochemical change, an assumed set of cha-
racteristics defining who should deliver the intervention,

targeted, patient-centered outcomes that the interven-
tion should generate as a result of its use, and a delivery
platform ( e.g., face-to-face, telephonic, web-based, mo-
bile health app, etc.). Other constructs may also define
the intervention.
The DSF anchors the ultimate benefit of the interven-
tion in terms of its ability to fit within a practice setting,
typically a clinical or community setting. This context car-
ries its own set of characteristics, including human andcapital resources, information systems, organizational cul-
ture, climate and structure, and processes for training
and supervision of staff. The DSF, consistent with othermodels, argues that these practice characteristics will
directly influence the ability of the intervention to reach
the patient population that could benefit, and thus mea-surement of these contextual constructs is paramount to
resolving fit.
At a third level, the DSF identifies the ecological system
as an additional driver of the successful implementation
and sustainability of an intervention. The ecological sys-
tem consists of many practice settings that influence thoseworking to incorporate a particular intervention, as well
as the legislative and regulatory environment, characteris-
tics of local, regional, state and national markets, andcharacteristics of the broad population. The ecological sys-
tem is influenced by changes to available interventions
and practice settings, and in turn, influences them.
Specific to the DSF, as emphasized by the dotted lines
in Figure 2, is the expectation that change is constant at
each of these levels (and ripples across multiple levels),and thus the success of an intervention to be sustained
over time lies in the measured, negotiated, and recipro-
cal fit of an intervention within a practice setting andthe practice setting within the larger ecological system.
The DSF suggests that optima l fit requires that charac-
teristics of the intervention, practice setting, and eco-logical system be consistently tracked, using valid, reliable
and relevant measures, and expects that interventions,
settings and the ecological system should change overtime, particularly where data can suggest improve-
ments for each to better meet the needs of patients,
the skills and resources within the practice setting, and
the larger ecology.
The DSF is intended to suggest a new paradigm to
consider the long-term use and ongoing improvement of
interventions, recognizing the limitations of the evidence
base made available through efficacy and effectiveness trials,and allowing that continuous ex posure of the intervention
to new populations, new contexts, and new innovations
can result in continued improvement of resulting out-comes, thus minimizing the perils of ‘program drift ’and
‘voltage drop. ’Indeed, the DSF posits that ongoing quality
improvement of interventions is the ultimate aim, not qua-lity assurance of them. To be clear, we see value in ensuringappropriate quality assurance within healthcare systems
where clear assessments of an ap propriate standard of care
are made through knowledge of core intervention com-ponents. However, the DSF recognizes the limitations of
intervention evidence solely from clinical trials and argues
that quality improvement processes focused on interven-tion optimization are ultimately more relevant to achieve
sustainment.
The DSF, which has benefitted from the authors ’on-
going dialogue with the Implementation Science com-
munity about the challenge of sustainability, follows the
spirit of a number of existing models that emphasizethree things —importance of context, the need for on-
going evaluation and decision-making, and the goal of
continuous improvement. These include Wandersman ’s
Getting to Outcomes model [31], Continuous Quality
Improvement (CQI) [34], system dynamics [35], com-
plexity theory [36], adaptive management [37], and theEvidence Integration Triangle [30]. In addition, the DSF
is consistent with alternative views of organizational
development [38] and the principles of system science[39]. Distinct in the DSF from many of these other
models is the emphasis on omnipresent change, and the
central goal of continuously optimizing the fit betweenthe intervention and a dynamic delivery context to achieve
maximal benefit. The DSF is anchored around the follo-
wing seven tenets, for which we think there is evidence,but recommend explicit testing in this context:
An intervention should not be optimized prior to
implementation, or even prior to ‘sustainability
phase ’onset
Interventions benefit from ongoing optimization as they
are applied in different contexts [37]. The evidence that
supports the benefits of health interventions arises from
trials that represent a very small slice of the diversity ofdemographics, preferences, and health status of the
population at large [7,40], but we should not expect evi-
dence collected in one set of narrow, relatively optimalcircumstances to apply perfectly in other, vastly different
contexts [41]. A ‘corollary ’of this recommendation is
that, other things being equal, quality improvement ap-proaches that involve adjusting and refining program
should be more effective than ‘quality assurance ’proce-
dures that emphasize fidelity to an initial protocol.
Interventions can be continually improved, boosting
sustainment in practice, and can enable ongoing learningamong developers, interventionists, researchers
and patients
There is tremendous opportunity to aggregate evidence
on the real-world impact of interventions when used in
practice. We can apply models of continual refinement
that have been the cornerstone of software developmentChambers et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:117 Page 5 of 11
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/8/1/117
(e.g., Firefox, Reaper, iTunes), as well as Web 2.0 sites ( e.g.,
Wikipedia, Facebook, etc.) [42]. By augmenting trial data
with practice-based evidence, we can understand muchmore about what works for whom, the question under-
lying personalized medicine [43,44]. This articulation of
the DSF suggests the need for a long-term plan to commitresources for training and ongoing improvement. One im-
plication of the DSF is that intervention impact can also
be enhanced through increases in efficiency. The field hasdeveloped a plethora of multi-component interventions,
often without studies that determine what the minimal set
of components are needed to ensure benefit [45]. TheDSF, congruent with the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research [46], emphasizes the impor-
tance of streamlining interventions to peel away compo-nents that may not be central to improving outcomes or
to adapt intervention components to a particular context.
Ongoing feedback on interventions should use practical,
relevant measures of progress and relevance
Too often, intervention trials focus on markers that are
psychometrically valid but of less relevance to patients and
clinicians [3,47]. For example, very specific, intervention-
related symptomatic scales may be most sensitive tochange, but there is little guarantee that the measured
change translates into a tangible, functional benefit for the
patient [48]. The DSF thus suggests the use of measuressuch as checklists that are relevant to desired outcomes of
patients, as well as sensitive to the ‘fit’between interven-
tions and context, and can be feasibly implemented [49].Across each of the changes in Figure 2, we see available
streams of data that can offer leverage points for improving
interventions. Environmenta l changes, for example, can be
tracked via population survey s, and market and claims data.
Practice changes can be capture d through electronic health
records, claims data and practice surveys. Evidence reviewscan provide key information on knowledge changes, and
policy changes can be tracked via available Federal and
Non-Profit sources ( e.g., CMS, Kaiser Family Foundation,
etc.). This is consistent with the CQI model, but with
specific emphasis on the ongoing refinement of the inter-
vention to counteract the assumptions of ‘Program Drift. ’
Voltage drop is NOT inevitable
We reject the assumption that the more diverse and
complex a patient population is, the smaller the benefit
of intervention, referred to above as ‘voltage drop ’[11].
This stems from an expectation that intervention studiesrequire control of the environment to isolate a treatment
effect [7]. If we embrace CQI of the specific health inter-
vention, we expect that with more experience, we willbetter be able to adapt interventions to contexts and pa-
tients. As we learn more about what works and what
doesn ’t and adjust protocols accordingly, the ‘voltage ’could maintain or possibly increase over time. This echoes
the computer industry, where each new release of a hard-
ware or software line is expected to be better than theprior version. It also finds consonance with the evolution
of the flu vaccine, which is constantly refined in response
to the changing nature of the influenza virus each season.A culture of improvement is central to ongoing interven-
tion use and treats improvement of the intervention as
central to the sustainability process [33].
Programs should be more likely to be maintained when
there is strong ‘fit ’between the program and the
implementation setting
The concept of ‘fit’has been discussed by other authors
(e.g., Estabrooks, Glasgow, Dzewaltowski), [50] and goes
back at least as far as Rogers ’Diffusion of Innovations
[51], where the concept of reinvention evoked the notion
of departing from the original intervention concept to‘create ’a new version suited to the preferences and con-
straints of the local context. Fit is a multi-level construct
and involves alignment along multiple dimensions [50].The DSF posits that fit will likely change over time, due
to changes in the way in which an intervention is deli-
vered, the characteristics of patients, providers and set-tings, and the broader ecological system within which
healthcare settings reside. Attention to this fit, through
ongoing assessment and quality improvement efforts,should improve sustainment and ultimately identify oppor-
tunities for intervention improvement.
Organizational learning should be a core value of the
implementation setting
While training and ongoing analyses exist in many organi-
zations, the demands imposed by multiple levels of change
require learning to be central to organizational activity for
interventions to become sustainable. The context bothwithin an organization and in the broader ecological sys-
tem is constantly changing, and requires a ‘learning orga-
nization ’[52] to engage in problem-solving capacity at
multiple levels [53]. Organizational learning should also
target appropriate adaptation of evidence-based interven-
tions, possibly in rapid learning cycles [44,54], followed byongoing assessment and feedback loops. The DSF is con-
gruent with the concepts of the learning healthcare system,
again with the emphasis on learning how to better develop,deliver and sustain interventions.
Ongoing stakeholder involvement throughout should
lead to better sustainability
Continuously engaging stakeholders throughout the plan-
ning, implementation and adaption processes should helpincrease the fit between the intervention and the local
context, and help address evolving issues that might inter-
fere with sustainability. Just as researchers have proposedChambers et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:117 Page 6 of 11
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/8/1/117
intervention development processes [12] that focus on
t h eu l t i m a t es i t ew h e r ei n t e r v e n t i o n sw i l lb ed e l i v e r e d ,w e
argue that partnership among all relevant stakeholders is
essential to maintaining and improving interventions within
care settings.
As Figure 3 depicts, we view sustainability as akin to
the challenge of fitting a puzzle piece within an evolving
large tableau. Without sensitivity to the characteristics
of the intervention, practice setting and the larger sys-
tem, there is little expectation that the intervention will
fit well within the setting, and as the context changes
(noted by the changing shape in the figure), sustainment
will be harder and harder to achieve. However, by exa-
mining and adapting the intervention to a changing con-
text, we believe that sustainment is not only possible,
but that the utility of the intervention can be optimized.
The experience of delivering the intervention in vivo
over time serves to inform the ongoing evolution of the
intervention (noted by the change in shape of the puzzle
piece). By concentrating on the dynamic ‘fit’between an
intervention and its delivery context as the core ingre-
dient underlying sustainability, we embrace opportu-
nities to refine and improve the intervention.
Contrasting static and dynamic views of sustainability
Table 2 compares static views of sustainability with the
DSF, offering sharp contrasts in data collection andanalysis, opportunities for knowledge development and in-
corporation of the ‘noise ’within healthcare contexts. Ra-
ther than seeking to simplify the phenomenon of study,
either by avoiding adaptation of interventions, or assuming
the context to be unchanging, the DSF embraces change as
a central influence on sustainability. Adaptation is ex-
pected, and even encouraged. Assessment of care settings
and outcomes is ongoing and incorporated within practice,
and staffing and policy changes are incorporated in sus-
tainability planning. Perhaps the biggest contrast of the
static and dynamic views is that the static view limits
lessons that can in turn provide feedback to other areas of
science; the DSF views an abundance of ongoing evidence
that can be cycled to continuously improve intervention
design, testing, and ongoing system change.
Discussion
Implications of the DSF
This initial formulation of the DSF has implications for
future practice, research and policy. For practice, the
DSF highlights the need for continuous assessment of
the local context, not just prior to implementation. This
enables care settings to better manage the fit between
their resources, needs and the interventions, including
generating consistent feedback on how interventions are
delivered to diverse patients and how patients do as a
result. The collection and analysis of this information
Figure 3 Using the dynamic sustainability framework as an engine for quality improvement. The DSF depicts a dynamic view of
sustainability, which allows for the evolution of an intervention within a changing delivery system. The changes in the shape of the puzzle pieces
and of the contexts reflects the ongoing change to interventions, practice settings, and care systems, and shows the use of quality improvement
methods to optimize the ‘fit’and improve the public health benefit of sustained use of interventions.Chambers et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:117 Page 7 of 11
http://www.implementationscience.com/content/8/1/117
allows practitioners to make informed decisions about
how best to utilize existing interventions, allows for po-tential enhancements to the interventions to be made
and shared, and offers better information on which to
make decisions to cease delivering interventions that donot have benefit. The intention is to recognize and support
rapid learning, real-time problem-solving organizations [54]
that are full partners in the generation of knowledge, notjust its application. Thus, the DSF promotes the use of mul-
tiple methods of planning for sustainability, including simu-
lation modeling of the impact of different decisions, pilottesting of adaptations within local contexts, and continued
experimentation. Perhaps an e ven greater benefit to prac-
tice would come through pooling of data across a larger setof sites, practitioners and pat ients, something done with
success for chronic d isease [55,56].
For research, the DSF dispels the notion that interven-
tion development, refinement and improvement are com-
pleted prior to real world implementation. In contrast,
we suggest that development and refinement is nevercomplete. Rather, sustainability is the process of managing
and supporting the evolution of an intervention within a
changing context. We recommend (and welcome testingof the idea) that programs that monitor context and adjust
accordingly do better long-term. In addition, we see re-
search studies testing whether settings and programsusing ongoing CQI or other means of feedback improve-
ment perform better over time. More broadly, we see the
DSF as changing the notion of a linear transition fromresearch to practice into a shared process of continual ex-
perimentation and analysis through the use of both prac-
tice settings and ecological systems to track changes andassess evolving fit between interventions and practice set-
tings. Principles of ‘crowd sourcing ’made popular within
the IT industry and resulting in open source products likeFirefox, Wikipedia and Reaper, blur the lines between re-
search and practice. We see this in the evolution of the
electronic health record, and the rapidly evolving patienthealth record, which is dramatically changing the scenario
from one where the medical expert makes all the decisions
to one of collaborative care and shared decision-making[57,58]. Instead of a small team of researchers developing
ap r i o r ia n ‘optimal, ’static product, a large and often vir-
tual community including users and consumers continu-
ously upgrades dynamic products.
This initial formulation of the DSF also has implications
for policy. Incentives are needed to support ongoing adap-
tation of interventions, particularly where evidence is li-
mited, specifically including monitoring of progress anddocumentation of adaptations, using quality measures rele-
vant to stakeholders and patients. In addition, research
funders must determine how to support longer-term pro-jects related to sustainability with flexible research designs,
since the ultimate benefit of integrating and modifying
interventions may not be evident for many years. Inaddition, infrastructure to support pooling of ‘practice-
based evidence ’will be needed, in order to ensure suffi-
cient information is available about long-term use andadaptation of interventions. The DSF aligns directly with
a number of existing policy initiatives, at national, state
and local levels, including the advance of Patient-CenteredMedical Homes, Accountable Care Organizations, Pay for
Performance initiatives, and support for local demonstra-
tion projects.
We recognize that this conceptualization of the DSF
model should, consistent with its internal logic, be refined
and improved over time. Whether this happens throughtesting of the tenets laid out in the previous section or
contributions of others ’theoretical or empirical studies,
we offer the DSF as the beginning of a longer debate. Forexample, while Figure 2 shows three levels (intervention,
practice setting, ecological system), we appreciate that
many more levels of the system exist than what we havedepicted in the figure. We see further specification of the
interrelationships of those levels as a useful area for fur-
ther research and development. In addition, we see theutility of aligning the DSF with alternative methods of de-
veloping and testing dissemination and implementation
interventions from the prevailing linear model. In an effortto present examples of how the DSF might be used to
consider the sustainability of various types of interven-
tions, we have included Table 3.Table 2 Contrasting static views of sustainability with the dynamic sustainability framework

intervention, from a dynamic sustainability view that we suggest in the DSF, in which change is inevitable and can lead to better fit and ultimately bet ter impact

Summary
It is time to embrace the culture of a learning healthcare
system [44,59] to promote sustainability of interventionsthat are optimized and customized to the myriad of
clinical and community settings. The enormous changes
in health systems in the past few years give particularsalience to a conceptualization of sustainability as adynamic process, and provide unparalleled opportunity to
test and refine the principles offered in this paper. With-
out this emphasis, we reify the past by asserting the pri-macy of evidence-based guidelines based on evidence
from rarified clinical trial settings, and give second-class
status to ongoing learning in real world settings. Allowingresearchers to be the only ones allowed to generate newTable 3 Illustrative examples of the use of DSF for different types of interventions
Intervention example Applying DSF principles
Clinical guidelines for pharmacotherapy
Clinical guidelines for pharmacotherapy to treat a range of chronic
diseases have been developed, implemented and refined as new
compounds have reached the market and new evidence has beengathered about the relative benefit of different medications.
The influences on prescribing practices exist at the patient level
(preferences and predictors of response), clinician level (practice patterns,level of training), system level (form ulary design, insurance coverage,
adherence monitoring).
Each influence will impact guideline i mplementation and overall benefit
of care for patients served within the health system.Assessing appropriate fit between guidelines and the care setting will
require analysis of multiple streams of data, including administrative,
clinical, organizational and epidemiologic.
The DSF suggests that collecting benchmarks over time on patient
outcomes, adaptations in algorithms used, available evidence (from the
literature, healthcare systems and patient populations), and contextualfactors could result in improvements to the guidelines, to the capacity ofthe health system to more seamlessly integrate the guidelines, to the
ecological system that could improve access, quality and health outcomes.
Psychotherapy for mood disorders
Manualized evidence-based psychotherapies for mood disorders have
been tested in numerous studies.
Many of these therapies are designed to be delivered by specific
providers, over a set number of sessions, with a clear step-by-step
approach.
Given variation in access to therapy ( e.g., number of sessions covered,
availability of therapists, time), limited predictive ability of response (how
many sessions are needed, what are active ingredients, who shoulddeliver therapy?), emergent options for mode of delivery (web-based,face-to-face, self-guided, asynchronous), optimizing psychotherapy for
individuals and systems is still be yond our current knowledge base.The DSF suggests manualized psychotherapy could be improved by
tracking variation in use and therapeutic response of patients, contextualcharacteristics that influence delivery, and additional interventions thataffect clinical and functional outcomes.
Systems could track how patients respond to varying doses of therapy,
modes of delivery, and clinician characteristics. Over time, decision-makerscould align available care to the needs of patient populations, and
clinicians could adapt practice patterns to data on patient preferences
and outcomes, and general needs of the patient population.
By assessing the fit of psychotherapy delivery with patients, the service
setting and the broader ecological system, the DSF hypothesizes that new
insights about psychotherapy optimi zation could drive improvements in
patient care.
Care management for chronic diseases
Studies have shown the effectiveness of care management strategies to
assess, intervene and monitor for a range of chronic conditions.
Typical strategies involve initial screening, assessment, treatment
planning, care and self-management strategies, and follow-up.
While general care management approaches seem to be durable,
specific approaches can have difficulty being implemented across many
clinical and community settings, because of limitations in resources (bothmonetary and staffing), information systems, financing processes, andother barriers.
With new technologies, additional evidence about treatment and
preventive interventions, and rec onfiguration of care systems, care
management for chronic diseases can be sustained and improved
in a large variety of care settings.Care management is influenced by drivers at patient, provider,
organization and system levels.
Care management requires coordination among multiple people,
organizational supports and capital resources, all of which will likely shiftover time.
Therefore, care management cannot be sustained without continual
assessment of fit within the local setting and the support of thecomponents of the model.
The DSF hypothesizes that attention to local adaptations made by
healthcare and community settings to fit the model; and feedback onstaffing levels, intensity of care management, emerging interventions andpatient outcomes could enhance lon g-term sustainability and model
improvement.
Evidence about who benefits most from different variants of care
management, who is an ideal care manager, and what are the best ways
of coordinating across primary care and specialty practice could lead to
better uptake and improve patient health.
Note. This table offers examples of how the sustainability of different types of interventions can be enhanced by applying the principles of the DSF. Both th e
descriptions of the interventions and the use of the DSF to improve them are exemplars to further the debate, and are not intended to comprehensively de pict
the extensive levels of influence.Chambers et al. Implementation Science 2013, 8:117 Page 9 of 11

knowledge limits the opportunities to consistently im-
prove the care we provide. In the past, these limitations
were technological; we lacked the tools and the sources ofinformation to drive rapid improvements. In this era of
‘crowd sourcing, ’of exponentially-expanding processing
power and global connectedness, we no longer need toadhere to a view that once created, interventions and
healthcare settings must be ‘frozen ’to optimize effective-
ness. Instead, we propose the DSF as helping to reconfig-ure the research-practice-policy interface, in which the
best possible information is gathered and used in real-
time to inform policy, improve practice, and answer thehighest priority research questions. Only then will the
promise of a learning healthcare system be reached.
