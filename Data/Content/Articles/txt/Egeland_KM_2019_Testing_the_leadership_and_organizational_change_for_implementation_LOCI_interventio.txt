Abstract
Background: Alignment across levels of leadership within an organization is needed for successful implementation
of evidence-based practice. The leadership and organizational change for implementation (LOCI) intervention is a
multi-faceted multilevel implementation strategy focusing on enhancing first-level general and implementation
leadership while also engaging with organization upper management to develop an organizational climate for
implementation. The aim of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of LOCI in supporting the implementation
of evidence-based treatment for PTSD in child- and adult-specialized mental health clinics in health trusts in
Norway.
Methods: The study design is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with enrollment of clinics in three cohorts.
Executives, clinic leaders, and therapists will be asked to complete surveys assessing leadership and implementation
climate. Surveys will be completed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 months. Results from surveys will be shared with
executives and clinic leaders to inform the subsequent creation of tailored leadership and climate development
plans for enhanced implementation. Patients will complete surveys measuring traumatic events and post-traumatic
stress symptoms during the therapy process. Therapy sessions will be audio or video recorded and scored for
fidelity as part of training.
Discussion: This study aims to provide knowledge on how to improve leadership and organizational climate to
enhance effective implementation of evidence-based treatments in mental health services.
Trial registration: The study has been registrated in ClinicalTrials with ID NCT03719651 .

Introduction
Health service managers face several leadership chal-
lenges in evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation,
as they need to ensure efficient use of resources and to
prioritize the quality of services to be provided. Leader-
ship has shown to be important for successful
organizational change [ 1], achieving good climate for
implementation [ 2], more positive attitudes toward
evidence-based practices (EBPs) [ 3], and better patient
outcomes such as patient satisfaction and quality of life
[4]. However, few leadership development models or
packages highlight specific strategies that organizations
and leaders can use to improve the climate for imple-
mentation in their treatment teams and to improve im-
plementation outcomes. Efforts that do not consider
both contextual and individual factors likely to facilitate
or hinder EBP implementation may result in poor or
failed implementation, substandard service delivery,
compromised patient outcomes, and decreased public
health impact [ 5].
This project will test strategies and develop knowledge
on how health care organizations and managers can lead
the implementation of EBPs for post-traumatic stress
disorders (PTSD) in child- and adult-specialized mental
health services. Specifically, the project will test the ef-
fectiveness of the Leadership and Organizational Change
for Implementation (LOCI) [ 5,6] intervention in a dif-
ferent health care context than where it was developed.
In addition, LOCI will be translated into Norwegian and
delivered and facilitated by two Norwegian teams, one
for youth clinics and one for adult clinics. Knowledge
derived from this project has the potential to inform
standards for EBP implementation so that EBPs are de-
livered with fidelity, thereby increasing the quality and
efficiency of the health services for improved patient
health outcomes.
The leadership and organizational change for
implementation (LOCI) strategy
LOCI is a 12-month empirically and theoretically based,
multi-faceted, and multilevel implementation strategy
that aims to improve first-level (e.g., clinic) general lead-
ership and implementation leadership combined with
the development, adaptation, and use of organizational
strategies to create a positive strategic organizational cli-
mate to support EBP implementation and sustainment
[6]. This study is being conducted in cooperation with
the developers of LOCI through a process of adaptation
for the Norwegian settings of mental health clinics with
multiple health trusts. All LOCI materials were trans-
lated into Norwegian and reviewed with the US LOCI
team (GAA, MGE, MS) through an iterative process of
review and adaptation in regard to both materials and
processes.LOCI targets multiple levels of leadership within an
organization to facilitate an aligned agenda toward EBP
implementation. It is designed to strengthen leadership
among first-level leaders (hereafter called LOCI leaders),
who have the role of supervision of individuals providing
direct services [ 7]. Although these leaders are in a pos-
ition to facilitate EBP implementation, they may often be
promoted based on clinical expertise with little support
or training in effective leadership of workplace change
efforts such as EBP implementation. In addition, LOCI
includes leaders at higher administrative levels in order
to create alignment and support for implementation
across all levels of the organizational structure [ 8].
LOCI utilizes both the Full-Range Leadership Model
(FRL) and implementation leadership as complementary
leadership skills and behaviors that can be utilized to de-
velop a positive EBP implementation climate and to effect-
ively lead the implementation process [ 9–11]. The FRL is
the most comprehensively researched and validated ap-
proach to leadership for individual and organizational de-
velopment [ 12,13]. It includes both tra nsformational and
transactional leadership. Tran sformational leadership is re-
lated to a leader ’s ability to inspire, create a compelling vi-
sion, and motivate their employees through being a positive
role model and creating a collective identity with a joint vi-
sion. Transactional leadership is related to a leader ’s ability
to manage and motivate their employees through appropri-
ate rewards [ 14]. Appropriate use of the two dimensions is
linked to effective leadership. Across several meta-analyses
summarizing over a hundred stud ies, transformational lead-
ership has been shown to consist ently predict effectiveness
outcomes across the individual and team levels of analysis
[13,15]. While the FRL addresses those leadership behav-
iors related to general leadership effectiveness, implementa-
tion leadership focuses specifically on how leaders can
enhance implementation effor ts in their organizations. The
implementation leadership approach involves behaviors
that fall on four dimensions: being knowledgeable about
the EBP being implemented and i ts role in the organization,
being proactive and anticipato ry in problem-solving, sup-
porting others in the implemen tation process, and perse-
vering through the ups and downs of the implementation
process [ 16].
Congruent with the emerging emphasis on mecha-
nisms in implementation and clinical science, implemen-
tation leadership is considered to be a primary
antecedent (i.e., determinant) of implementation climate
(i.e., target), defined as “employees ’shared perception of
the importance of innovation implementation within the
organization ”[11]. LOCI also builds on the work of
Schein [ 1] utilizing climate embedding mechanisms to-
ward enhanced implementation climate. Leaders can
change and transmit the organizational culture and climate
through primary embedding mechanisms, such as what theEgeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 2 of 12
leaders and organization emphasize, value, reward, and
focus on. For example, what leaders pay attention to meas-
ure and control; how they react to critical incidents; how
resources are allocated for role modeling, teaching and
coaching, recognition, rewards, and status; and how leaders
recruit, select, and promote employees. Secondary embed-
ding mechanisms reinforce primary mechanisms and may
include organizational syste ms, processes, and procedures,
formal statements (e.g., mission and vision) stories, and
organizational rituals. LOCI also aims to improve psycho-
logical safety climate that promotes a more engaged and ef-
fective workforce [ 17]. It is furthermore anticipated that
leadership and climate impact implementation effectiveness
through employees ’actual behavior. Such behaviors include
implementation citizenship behavior, defined as going
above and beyond what is required in order to support the
implementation of EBP [ 18]. The actual behavior of em-
ployees that can support the implementation of EBP can
take the form of helping others, keeping informed, showing
commitment to the EBP in focus, and supporting its use.
Figure 1illustrates how LOCI is hypothesized to work; the
intervention will have a proximal effect on improved lead-
ership, which will strengthen the work group climate,
which will then be related to therapist conception and be-
havior such as clinician ’s implementation citizenship behav-
ior and sense of job demands, and ultimately to
implementation outcomes, inc luding treatment fidelity, im-
plementation process, and patient outcomes.Preliminary results from evaluation of LOCI have
shown that the implementation strategy is feasible and
acceptable; improves leader knowledge, engagement, and
implementation behaviors; and has utility to improve
staff-rated leadership for EBP implementation [ 5]. In
addition, LOCI leads to improvements in staff-rated im-
plementation climate [ 19]. However, similar to research
on other implementation strategies, research on LOCI is
still limited. It has been tested in one study [ 5], in
addition to one ongoing randomized controlled trial [ 6],
both in the United States. LOCI has not yet been
adapted and tested in other countries. Consequently,
there is a knowledge gap in the documented effect and
generalizability of strategies for implementation leader-
ship. Replication is needed, and in particular, where
LOCI is conducted not by the developers, but by other
researchers or service providers.
The implementation of evidence-based practices for
PTSD in Norway is initiated and funded by the Norwe-
gian Ministry of Health and Care Services and imple-
mented by the Norwegian Center for Violence and
Traumatic Stress Studies (NKVTS). The overall aims of
this national initiative are that therapists ’knowledge of
trauma and trauma treatment will be enhanced, patients
with post-traumatic stress symptoms will receive the
best evidence-supported treatments, and the knowledge
and quality with which treatment methods are provided
to patients will be maintained over time.
Fig. 1 Conceptual model for the present study. Effects of LOCI on leadership, implementation climate, citizenship and job demands. Planned
analyses will compare LOCI versus control on proximal and distal outcomes. Exploratory analyses will examine mediational and cross-level effectsEgeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 3 of 12
PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after
experiencing life-threatening or extreme stressful
events such as accidents, assaults, or violence. The
symptoms may lead to decreased functioning, social
isolation, increased risk of suicide, and the develop-
ment of comorbid diseases such as depression, anx-
iety, and substance abuse [ 20]. A recent study on the
epidemiology of PTSD in Norway showed that the
lifetime prevalence was 4.3% for women and 1.4% for
men, and the mean duration of PTSD was 9 years for
women and 17 years for men [ 21]. As a comparison,
the prevalence is estimated to be higher than both
lung cancer and colorectal cancer, illustrating the high
prevalence of PTSD in the Norwegian population. In
2017, 6% of children in Norwegian psychiatric out-
patient services received a PTSD diagnosis [ 22].
During the project, all therapists in the participating
clinics will be trained in screening and diagnosing of
PTSD. In addition, three of the most well-documented
EBPs for PTSD will be implemented [ 23,24]. In adult
clinics, eye movement and desensitization reprocessing
(EMDR) and cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD)
will be implemented. EMDR is an integrative
eight-phase individual approach which is guided by the
adaptive information processing model [ 25]. EMDR has
shown to be effective for patients with PTSD in several
studies [ 26–28]. CT-PTSD is individualized treatment
using trauma memories and reactions to related triggers
by imaginary and in-vivo exposure [ 29]. CT-PTSD has
shown to be effective for patients with PTSD [ 30,31]. In
child and youth clinics, trauma-focused cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (TF-CBT) [ 32] will be implemented. These
clinics serve children aged 6 –18 years and their
non-offending caregiver(s) on a weekly basis over 12 –15
weeks. TF-CBT is phase based, builds on cognitive be-
havioral principles, and incorporates principles from
family therapy. Research from more than 20 randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) has demonstrated that TF-CBT is
effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms as
well as depressive symptoms (e.g., [ 33]).
The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effects
of the LOCI implementation strategy on the implementa-
tion of EMDR, CT-PTSD, and TF-CBT in regular mental
health clinical practice in Norwegian health trusts. The
study ’s specific aims and hypotheses are the following:
1. Test the effect of LOCI on full-range leadership and
implementation leadership compared to control
condition.
H1a: Implementation leadership will improve signifi-
cantly more in the LOCI vs. control condition.
H1b: Full-range leadership will improve significantly
more in the LOCI vs. control condition.2. Test the effect of LOCI on clinic level
implementation climate, job demands toward
evidence-based practices for PTSD, and practitioner
implementation citizenship behaviors compared to
control condition.
H2a: Implementation climate will show significantly
greater improvement in LOCI vs. control condition.
H2b: Therapists will report significantly lower job de-
mands in the LOCI vs. control condition.
H2c: Therapists will demonstrate greater implementa-
tion citizenship in the LOCI vs. control condition.
3. Test the effects of LOCI on EBP reach.
H3: Significantly more patients will have received the
EBP in the LOCI vs. control condition.
4. Test the effect of LOCI on fidelity outcomes
compared to control condition.
H4a: Therapists will show greater improvements in
EBP fidelity in the LOCI vs. control condition.
5. Test the effect of LOCI on patient outcomes
compared to control condition.
H5a: Patients will show significantly greater improve-
ments in symptom reduction (post-traumatic stress) and
recovery rates in the LOCI vs. control condition.
6. Explore mediational and cross-level effects of
leadership on climate, climate on implementa-
tion citizenship, and climate and citizenship on
EBP reach (e.g., effects of clinic level climate on
therapist attitudes) and test the effects of leader-
ship strategies on implementation climate, sub-
sequent effects on attitudes toward EBP,
implementation citizenship, job demands, and
turnover intention. Example hypotheses include
thefollowing:
H6a: More positive implementation climate at the
clinic level will be associated with more positive
therapist-level attitudes toward EBP, implementation
citizenship, job demands, and turnover intention.
H6b: More positive clinic level psychological safety
climate will be associated with more positive
therapist-level EBP attitudes , implementation citizen-
ship, job demands, and turnover intention.
H6c: Implementation climate will mediate the ef-
fects of leadership on attitudes toward EBP, imple-
mentation citizenship, job demands, and turnover
intention.Egeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 4 of 12
7. Explore the need for adaptation of the LOCI
intervention to the specific culture and context of
Norway and each of the health trusts.
Methods
Design
To study the effectiveness of LOCI, a dynamic wait-list
design [ 34], also called a stepped-wedge design [ 35] will
be used. The stepped-wedge design is a rigorous alterna-
tive to the randomized controlled trial and parallel clus-
ter studies. In a stepped-wedge design, all units start in
their usual practice condition and clusters are randomly
and sequential crossed from a control to an intervention
condition. Units are typically randomized to regular time
intervals (steps) wherein the units cross over to the
intervention condition. As a result, at each time interval,
there is a between-unit comparison of those units that
are assigned to the new intervention condition and those
units that remain in the usual practice condition. There
is also a within-unit comparison made as the units
change from the usual practice condition into the new
intervention condition. In this study, units (i.e., health
trusts) are randomly assigned to one of three cohorts in-
dicating the time interval wherein that unit will partici-
pate in the LOCI intervention. This design was chosen
due to the advantage of rolling out the same implemen-
tation strategy to all clinics in phases and that no clinics
will be excluded from the implementation strategy.
All clinical staff in all the participating clinics will re-
ceive training in PTSD screening, and assessment and a
subgroup of clinicians will receive training in PTSD
treatment at the beginning of the study. The clinics will
be randomized into one out of three cohorts, and the
leaders will start the LOCI training at different
time-periods, at 4-month intervals. Allocation will be de-
termined by a statistician using computer-generated ran-
dom number sequence. The 15 adult clinics will be
randomized into three cohorts of size five based on
co-located or closely working clinics (to reduce the
chances of contamination), number of practitioners (<
20 or ≥20), and the number of practitioners per LOCI
leader (< 15 or ≥15). For the seven health trusts encom-
passing the child clinics, a similar process will be used
to assign them to three cohorts of size 2, 2, and 3. The
variables that will be used in balancing are the total
number of practices within the health trust, number of
therapists trained to deliver TF-CBT, weighted
centralization index, and number of municipalities
served. The implementation strategy effects are deter-
mined by comparing data points in the innovation sec-
tion of the wedge with those in the control section. The
unit of analysis will be clinics or workgroups. Qualitative
interviews with the LOCI leaders will be conducted at
the end of LOCI training, in connection with thegraduation, to look at the need for adaptation and docu-
menting adaptations to LOCI.
Based on the capacity of the project group, we calcu-
lated that we could include 47 clinics. We then calcu-
lated the power based on the sample size. To calculate
power, we assume the same standard deviation for differ-
ences between clinics, therapists within clinics, and
within therapists. Fifteen clinics switch at time 1, 15
others at time 2, and the remaining 17 at time 3 (see
Table 1). There will be no changes from time 4 to 6. The
setup is longitudinal, and the same therapists are
followed throughout. The answers are at the therapist
level. Power calculation shows that a difference at a little
below .4 standard deviations is detectable with 80%
power.
Implementation framework
The project utilizes the Exploration, Preparation, Imple-
mentation, Sustainment (EPIS) conceptual framework to
guide the identification of important theoretical con-
structs as well as their operationalization [ 36]. Prelimin-
ary work for this project was conducted during the
exploration phase in which academic and health system
partners considered both how to address PTSD, and
how best to support implementation of selected EBPs.
The bulk of the project will be conducted in the later
three EPIS phases, and EPIS will guide tracking of pro-
gress through the phases.
Setting
Norway consists of about 5.3 million inhabitants. Of
these, 17% are immigrants or with immigrant parents, of
which 7% from the European Union/European Eco-
nomic Area and 4.3% are refugees. The government is
responsible for the provision of treatment and the pro-
motion of public welfare and health to everyone, on
equal terms and irrespective of income. Coverage is uni-
versal and automatic for all residents, and is financed
through national and municipal taxes [ 37]. The health-
care system is semi-decentralized and distinguishes be-
tween specialized and community care. The state is
responsible for specialized care, which is administered
by four Regional Health Authorities, each responsible
for several health trusts that include mental health divi-
sions consisting of both inpatient and outpatient services
[38]. In 2017, 5.1% of the child population and 4.6% of
the adult population received treatment in the special-
ized services [ 39].
The study will take place within Norwegian health
trusts ’mental health clinics in both child- and
adult-specialized services. Child and youth clinics
(Barne -og ungdomspsykiatrisk poliklinikk , BUP) are out-
patient clinics for children up to 18 years and their fam-
ilies. There are about 87 BUPs all over Norway. DistrictEgeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 5 of 12
psychiatric centers (DPS) include different adult out-
patient and inpatient services. Within DPS, mainly gen-
eral outpatient clinics will be recruited, because patients
with PTSD are often referred to these clinics, including
those with war and refugee experiences. There are about
75 DPSs all over Norway.
Participants
The project will consist of four main groups of
participants:
1. First-level leaders (referred to as LOCI leaders)
(approximate N= 47) from the clinics will
participate in the LOCI innovation.
2. One or more executive leaders from each health
trust (approximate N= 23) will participate in
organizational strategy meetings (described below)
to support the LOCI leaders.
3. All therapists (approximate N= 700) in the
participating clinics will be asked to participate in
the training of PTSD screening. A sample of
therapists (approximate N= 220) will be trained and
supervised in PTSD treatment.
4. Patients (approximate N= 660) that are referred to
the clinics as normal, report traumatic experiences
and fulfill the criteria for PTSD will be offered to
participate in the study. They will receive PTSD
treatment.
Recruitment
The project aims at recruiting 27 child and youth mental
health clinics within 7 different health trusts and 20
adult mental health clinics within seven different health
trusts in specialized services from all over Norway. The
child and adult clinics will be recruited via the four re-
gional health trusts, which will receive an invitation by
e-mail and/or telephone. Clinics may also receive infor-
mation by the project team at the NKVTS giving lec-
tures about the project in different settings. The clinics
in conjunction with the relevant health trust will decide
who will participate in the LOCI training —one fromeach clinic or team. This will usually be the BUP leader
(child) or the clinic leader (adult) but in some cases a
team leader. All therapists and leaders in the participat-
ing clinics will be asked to participate in the study. They
will receive advance information about the study and
consent electronically prior to each survey. A sample of
therapists will be trained in PTSD treatment and asked
to recruit three PTSD patients each. The patients will
receive advance information about the study and con-
sent electronically (adult clinics) and in paper format
(caregivers and children above 16 years old in the child
clinics) prior to each survey.
Consent forms will be available in Norwegian. To ac-
commodate other language-speaking residents, the adult
patient questionnaire will be translated into English,
Arabic, and Somali. The clinics will also be offered fi-
nancial support for using interpreters to assist with con-
sent forms and questionnaires.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Child and adult outpatient clinics in specialized health
services are included. All leaders and therapists in the
clinics will be asked to participate in the surveys. Ad-
ministrative employees are excluded as most of the mea-
sures will not be applicable to these staff. Staff must be
employees of the participating clinics. Leaders that do
not agree to participate in the leadership training (LOCI)
will not be eligible to participate.
Patients (6 –18 for youth clinics, 18 –100 years for adult
clinics) with PTSD will be asked to participate in the
study by their therapist. There are no specific exclusion
criteria, as the referrals should follow standard proce-
dures within the clinics.
LOCI intervention
The LOCI intervention consists of several components:
(1) 360° assessment
A 360° assessment where the LOCI leaders, the thera-
pists who report to them, and the executive leader areTable 1 Data collection
Shaded area indicates LOCI intervention periodEgeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 6 of 12
asked to complete a web-based survey focused primarily
on the leadership of the LOCI leader and the implemen-
tation climate in his/her unit. Questions to therapists
and the executive leaders are worded so that they are
reporting on the appropriate LOCI leader. The LOCI
leaders are asked questions about their own leadership,
climate in their clinic, and on the implementation citi-
zenship of their therapists.
Descriptive results from the 360° assessment are pre-
sented in an individual feedback report for each of the
LOCI leaders in the LOCI condition. Each of the LOCI
leaders will receive their own feedback reports during
the initial and follow-up leadership trainings, and they
will not be required to share it with anyone besides the
research group. Feedback reports for the executives will
utilize data aggregated across all clinics within the re-
spective health trusts. Executives will be presented with
their feedback reports at initial and follow-up
organizational strategy meetings (see below).
Leadership training
Training
Initial leadership training. The LOCI intervention be-
gins with a two-day workshop for the LOCI leaders. The
workshop addresses leadership in general, with a par-
ticular focus on the full-range leadership model, transac-
tional leadership, and implementation leadership. The
LOCI leaders are challenged to share own experiences
and views on leadership, and examples of leadership
styles are shared and discussed. Implementation climate
is also addressed, with a focus on strategies leaders can
use to support implementation of EBPs. Mid-way in the
workshop, at both day 1 and 2, the feedback reports
from the 360° assessment will be shared individually
with each of the LOCI leaders. The LOCI facilitator and
the LOCI leader review the report together, identifying
strengths and areas they would like to further develop.
In a collaborative method, the LOCI facilitator and the
LOCI leader draft that leader ’s individual leadership de-
velopment plan wherein goals and committed actions
are detailed to facilitate enhancement in their leadership
and the implementation climate of their clinic.
Booster leadership training . The leadership training is
followed by a one-day booster session after 4 and 8
months. Before each booster session, a new 360° assess-
ment will be completed, resulting in updated feedback
reports, where the data is presented in graphs so that it
is easy to see the development from the baseline assess-
ment to the assessment at 4 and 8 months. The feedback
report makes the basis for the leaders ’subsequent work
with the individual leadership development plan.
Organizational strategies, goals, and leadership are ad-
dressed through group discussions.Graduation . At month 12, there will be a ritual to
mark the completion of the program. Accomplishments
are celebrated, challenges are addressed, and plans for
further sustainment are shared.
Coaching calls with first-level leaders
The LOCI leaders will participate in weekly brief con-
sultation calls over the phone (10 –30 min) with their
LOCI facilitator where the goals are to give the leaders
the opportunities to strategize methods for overcoming
barriers to EBP implementation, follow up on the leader-
ship development plan, and update the leadership devel-
opment plan according to the work being done and new
information. Once a month, the individual calls are re-
placed with one-hour group consultation calls with all
the LOCI leaders within the cohort.
Organizational strategy meetings (OSMs)
LOCI leaders and executives meet with the LOCI facil-
itator(s) for 2 h following the first leadership training.
The first meeting is in-person. At this meeting, the
LOCI leaders and executives will receive feedback from
the 360° survey followed by the iterative development of
an implementation climate development plan in light of
the results from the survey. The subsequent meetings
take place on a web conferencing platform at months 4,
8, and 12. The executive will participate in brief (15 –30
min) monthly telephone coaching calls with the LOCI
facilitator where the focus is to follow up on the imple-
mentation climate development plan in light of the re-
sults from the 360° survey.
Fidelity
The LOCI developers will rate fidelity by observing the
LOCI activities and documents directly or by videotap-
ing. The Norwegian LOCI facilitators will receive regular
supervision from the developers via web conferencing
platform.
The therapists will audiotape (TF-CBT and CT-PTSD)
or videotape (EMDR) all trauma treatment sessions from
three cases through applications on iPads specifically
programmed for this project. Randomly chosen therapy
sessions for each therapist will be checked for fidelity
through fidelity checklists. In child clinics, trained
TF-CBT supervisors will do the fidelity assessments. In
adult clinics, trained EMDR / CT-PTSD supervisors will
assess one session on fidelity. In addition, students will
assess five sessions on fidelity. The therapists will receive
written fidelity feedbacks as soon as possible after the
session has been videotaped or audiotaped.
Trauma screening and treatment training
In child clinics, the participants will receive 2 h of train-
ing in trauma and PTSS screening and assessment
(CATS, see Measures). The clinics will recruit a sample
of therapists (approximately 20% of the therapists) forEgeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 7 of 12
the TF-CBT training. The therapists will receive 3 days
of training and participate in 30 min weekly consultation
group calls with 4 –5 other TF-CBT therapists and a
TF-CBT consultant (train-the-trainer certified) for 12
months. The TF-CBT consultants will conduct training
and consultation. The therapists will be asked to recruit
four patients each.
In adult clinics, the participants will receive half day of
training in trauma and PTSD screening and assessment
(TRAPS, see Measures). The clinics will be encouraged
to recruit at least three therapists to both CT-PTSD and
EMDR. The therapists will receive 3 days of training in
one of the models. In addition, they will receive 10 h of
consultation group calls divided by 2 h once a month for
5 months. Trained specialists in the interventions will
conduct training and consultation. The therapists will be
asked to recruit three patients each.
Data collection and management
Data are collected from therapists, LOCI leaders, and
executives at baseline, and at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 months.
Participants will receive invitations to complete web sur-
veys through e-mail. Participants will not receive any
compensation for their participation. The therapist and
LOCI leader survey takes on average 25 min to
complete, whereas the executive survey takes on average
15 min to complete. Results on leadership, implementa-
tion climate, and attitudes about EBPs will be shared
with the LOCI leaders and the executive leaders as part
of the LOCI feedback process.
Patients will fill out a questionnaire by iPad in connec-
tion with all therapy sessions. It takes on average 30 min
to complete. Patients can receive trauma treatment even
if they do not want to participate in the research. All
data will be stored on the University Center for Sensitive
Data and the Norwegian Centre for Research Data. Re-
sults from some of the scales will be shared with the
therapist by a report function on the iPad.
Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a sub-
sample of the LOCI leaders after the third cohort. Key
questions that will be investigated include the adaption,
reception, and perceived benefit of LOCI.
Measures
The Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS)
ILS is a 12-item measure addressing leadership support
for the usage of EBP [ 16]. It includes four subscales: (1)
proactive leadership, (2) knowledgeable leadership, (3)
supportive leadership, and (4) perseverant leadership.
The scale is scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (to a very
great extent). LOCI leaders rate themselves, and their
therapists and executive do the same for their LOCI
leader. The scale has sound psychometric properties,
with an Alpha value of .965 for the total scale [ 40].The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ)
MLQ is a 36-item measure addressing transformational
and transactional leadership [ 41]. Transformational lead-
ership is assessed by four subscales: (1) idealized Influ-
ence (8 items), (2) inspirational motivation (4 items), (3)
intellectual stimulation (4 items), and (4) individual con-
sideration (4 items). Transactional leadership is assessed
by two subscales: (1) contingent reward (4 items) and (2)
active management-by-exception (4 items). The ques-
tionnaire is scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (frequently, if
not always). LOCI leaders rate themselves to which they
engage in specific behaviors measured by the MLQ, and
therapists do the same for their LOCI leader. The MLQ
has good to excellent psychometric properties with
Cronbach ’s alphas ranging from .76 to .90.
The Implementation Climate Scale (ICS)
ICS is an 18-item measure addressing to what extent an
organization supports the implementation of EBP [ 10].
It includes six subscales: focus on EBP, educational sup-
port for EBP, recognition for EBP, rewards for EBP , selec-
tion for EBP , and selection for openness. The scale is
scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (to a very great extent).
Both the LOCI leaders, the therapists, and the executive
rate the organizational climate. The ICS has excellent in-
ternal consistency and convergent and discriminant val-
idity. The ICS has an overall Cronbach ’s alpha of .91.
The Implementation Climate Measure (ICM)
ICM is a 6-item measure addressing the general imple-
mentation climate in the organization [ 42]. Consistent
with the work of Klein et al. [ 11], it includes three sub-
scales: what is expected, what is supported, and what is
rewarded in the clinic in regard to implementation of
the new innovation. The measure is scored from 0 (not
at all) to 4 (often, if not always). Both the LOCI leaders,
the therapists, and the executive rate the organizational
climate.
Workload (QPS)
Thirteen items from the QPS Nordic questionnaire [ 43]
is used to measure therapists ’coping with work (6 items)
and job demands (7 items). The scale is scored from 1
(very seldom or never) to 5 (very often or always). The
reliability has shown to be satisfactory and is a good in-
strument for assessing health-related factors at work
[44].
The Implementation Citizenship Behavior Scale (ICBS)
ICBS is a six-item measure addressing therapist behavior
that goes beyond their duty to support the implementa-
tion of EBP [ 18]. The scale is scored from 0 (Not at all)
to 4 (Frequently, if not always). This is scored by theEgeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 8 of 12
LOCI leader. The ICBS has demonstrated excellent in-
ternal consistency reliability ( α= .93).
The evidence-based practice attitude scale (EBPAS)
EBPAS is a well-established 15-item scale to measure
practitioners ’attitudes toward making use of
evidence-based practices [ 45]. A five-point Likert scale is
used to assess degree of agreement with a given state-
ment (0 = not at all to 4 = to a very great extent). Higher
mean scores indicate more favorable attitudes. The
EBPAS has adequate internal consistency, and construct
and content validity.
Turnover intentions
The staff will be asked about their intentions on staying
in their job. A measure consisting of three questions will
be used [ 46]. Responses to each item are on a
seven-point scale.
Reach
A 15-item measure has been developed for the study, in-
cluding questions regarding the therapists ’participation
in training, their use of trauma assessments and PTSD
treatment, and how many of their patients have received
EBPs for PTSD.
Fidelity
TF-CBT Brief Practice Fidelity Checklist is an adjusted
version of the TF-CBT checklist [ 32]. The checklist is
scored as “child session, ”“caregiver session, ”or“child
and caregiver session. ”It is measured from 0 “Not
Used, ”1“Medium Extensiveness, ”to 3 “High Extensive-
ness”. Each TF-CBT component must be addressed in
the right order (if there are no therapeutic decisions on
excluding a component, or to change the order of the
practice), and the therapist needs to progress from one
component to the next within “a reasonable time period
given that the treatment should be completed within 16
sessions for usual cases and up to 20 for complex cases ”
[47]. Also, therapists must include parallel work with
caregivers. The TF-CBT brief practice fidelity checklist
will be validated during the project.
The Treatment integrity checklist for EMDR (used in
the T-TIP study, [ 48]) consists of 16 items evaluating
whether the therapist carries out the manual correctly
(“yes”or“not relevant ”= 1 point, “no”= 0 point). Max-
imal score is 16 points. The scale will be validated dur-
ing the project.
Cognitive Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder :
A Checklist of Therapist Competency (Ehlers, not pub-
lished) consists of 16 items evaluating therapists ’general
and specific therapeutic skills on a range between 0
(poor) and 6 (excellent). The scale will be validated dur-
ing the project.Patient measures
The Child & Adolescent Trauma Screening Question-
naire (CATS ),revised version , is used to assess trauma
exposure and the frequency of all post-traumatic stress
symptoms within the last 2 weeks. The first version of
CATS, based on the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5, dem-
onstrated good reliability [ 49]. The revised CATS is
based on the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 and ICD-11
and consists of 20 symptom items and 5 functional im-
pairment items. A total symptom severity scale score
ranging from 0 to 60 is calculated. Screening cut-off
point is 15.
The Trauma and PTSD screening (TRAPS ) consists of
two instruments. Page one is a revised version of Stress-
ful Life Events Questionnaire (SLESQ )[50], asking for
the patients exposure of 15 different trauma events (yes
or no). If the patient has experienced any of the different
events, the patient will be asked to fill out page two.
This consists of the PTSD Checklist for DSM -5(PCL-5)
[51] and is used to assess exposure and frequency of all
the post-traumatic stress symptoms within the last
month (0 = not at all, 4 = a lot). Screening cut-off point
is 33.
Data analysis
For hypotheses 1a and b; 2a, b, and c; and 4a, a mixed
effects model [ 52] for a stepped-wedge design with mul-
tiple time points, multiple clinics (LOCI leaders), and
multiple therapists per clinic leader will be estimated.
All these outcomes (ILS, ICS, EBPAS, ICBS, job de-
mands, turnover intention) are defined at the level of the
leader-therapist dyad. For hypothesis 3 (reach), a similar
model will be estimated, but without the therapist level
since the number of patients included is not specific for
individual therapists. Reach is a count variable but is
planned to be estimated as continuous in this analysis.
For hypothesis 5a (symptom scores), a further level is
planned to include an additional level of patient within
the therapist. Hypothesis 6 will be explored by causal
mediation analysis [ 53]. Prior to substantive analyses, we
will assess the data to determine if it is justified to aggre-
gate employee responses to the first level as proposed in
the nested data structure (e.g., employees nested within
clinics).
Discussion
Implementation of EBP can be challenging. In particular,
the implementation of evidence-based treatment models
for PTSD has been described as one of the biggest chal-
lenges in psychiatric health care [ 54]. This is underlined
by several studies reporting that PTSD interventions are
under-utilized and challenging to sustain after initial dis-
semination [ 55,56]. Research has pointed to therapists ’
concerns about using exposure-based treatment as aEgeland et al. Implementation Science           (2019) 14:28 Page 9 of 12
barrier to implementation, as they believe it can exacer-
bate both PTSD and comorbid symptoms [ 57], and that
findings from clinical trials may not be representative for
their patient population [ 58].
Leaders in the health care system are responsible for
providing effective treatments in their services to a cer-
tain number of patients within a given time period. In
order to increase the probability that patients will re-
ceive the most effective care for their symptoms, the
leaders have to obtain effective strategies to promote the
adoption of the EBP. The LOCI intervention addresses
leadership in general, implementation leadership in par-
ticular, and organizational strategies in order to support
the implementation of EBP and sustainment over time.
Available data suggest that LOCI is effective in support-
ing implementation of EBP through strengthening lead-
ership and a positive implementation climate [ 6]. This
study will test LOCI in a Norwegian mental health set-
ting. A stepped-wedge design will be used to investigate
whether the LOCI will have an effect on leadership, the
implementation climate at the clinics, and the clinic ’s
ability to offer trauma-focused treatments to patients
with clinical levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms.
It is a strength that the design enables all clinics to re-
ceive the same implementation strategy, in addition to
examining the effect of the LOCI program. However, the
time gap between therapists receiving training in the
PTSD treatment interventions and the leaders receiving
training in the LOCI program might not be optimal for
the implementation of the interventions in the last two
cohorts. Moreover, even though clinics were randomized
to avoid contamination between them, it might be a
small chance of some contamination between clinics
that are geographically close to each other.
The knowledge derived from this study can be used to
support the implementation of EBPs for PTSD within
mental health systems. Leaders can use strategies to de-
velop system and organizational climates conducive to
EBP implementation and sustainment. Hence, know-
ledge from this project can promote standards for imple-
mentation of EBPs in general through enhancing leaders ’
competence in how to efficiently implement EBPs, which
may increase the use of EBPs and thereby increase the
quality and effectiveness of health services. The results
can be transferred to health and social services in gen-
eral, as the innovation can be utilized in all services that
are to implement EBPs. Policy-makers and researchers
are calling for more and better research in implementa-
tion science [ 59,60], including the leaders ’role during
the implementation process [ 40]. This project can hence
contribute to raise an under-researched field.
