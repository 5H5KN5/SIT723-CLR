Abstract  
Background: During the perinatal period, common mental disorders (CMDs) such as depression and anxiety are 
highly prevalent, especially in low-resource settings, and are associated with domestic violence, poverty, and food 
insecurity. Perinatal CMDs have been associated with several adverse maternal and child outcomes. While the Depart -
ment of Health in South Africa provides healthcare workers with the tools to detect psychological distress and experi-
ences of domestic violence, few healthcare workers routinely screen pregnant women at clinic visits, citing discomfort 
with mental health issues and the lack of standardised referral pathways as the key barriers. The aim of this study is to 
select and evaluate a set of health systems strengthening (HSS) interventions aimed at improving the care and out -
comes for perinatal women with CMDs and experiences of domestic violence, attending public healthcare facilities in 
Cape Town.
Methods: This study consists of a pre-implementation, development, and implementation phase. Contextual barriers 
identified during the pre-implementation phase included poor patient knowledge and health-seeking behaviour, 
high levels of stigma, and poor detection, referral, and treatment rates. Implementation science determinant frame -
works were applied to findings from the pre-implementation phase to identify determinants and gaps in delivering 
high-quality evidence-informed care. A participatory Theory of Change workshop was used to design a HSS pro -
gramme, consisting of awareness raising, detection, referral, and treatment. HSS interventions selected to support the 
delivery of the HSS programme includes training, health promotion, change to the healthcare environment, task-
sharing, audit and feedback, and performance monitoring. The implementation phase will be used to assess several 
implementation and clinical outcomes associated with the delivery of the HSS programme, which will be piloted at 
three healthcare facilities. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to evaluate the implementation and 
clinical outcomes.

Background
Common mental disorders (CMDs), such as depression 
and anxiety, are highly prevalent during the perinatal 
period (pregnancy and the first year postpartum) in the 
Western Cape, South Africa. A facility-based study in 
Hanover Park, a low-income, residential suburb in Cape 
Town [1], reported that 21% of pregnant women were 
diagnosed with depression and 23% were diagnosed with 
anxiety [2]. Similar results were obtained from a study in 
Khayelitsha — a large peri-urban township settlement in 
Cape Town — where 19% of pregnant women screened 
positive for a CMD [3].
In low-resource settings such as these, the prevalence 
of domestic violence, poverty, and food insecurity is 
high. Interpersonal violence is ranked second in its con -
tribution to the burden of disease in South Africa, and 
among women, intimate partner violence accounts for 
62% of the burden of interpersonal violence [4]. Recent 
studies among perinatal women in Cape Town reported 
that approximately 15% of pregnant women experi -
enced domestic violence during the past 12 months, 
more than 40% lived in food-insecure households, and 
food insecurity and domestic violence increased the risk 
of subsequently developing a CMD [2, 5–7]. Further -
more, perinatal CMDs have been associated with sev -
eral adverse consequences for both mother and child, 
including preterm birth, low birthweight, and diminished 
mother-infant bonding [8, 9].
Following South Africa’s adoption of the Mental Health 
Policy Framework and Strategic Plan 2013–2020 [10], 
which states that mental health should be integrated into 
maternal and child health platforms, maternal and child 
health were identified by the National Department of 
Health (DoH) as key priority areas. With this in mind, 
an updated version of the Maternity Case Record (MCR) 
— a record book given to pregnant women and used to 
record all clinical details of the pregnancy [11] — con -
taining a three-item mental health screening question -
naire [12], was released. The mental health screening 
questionnaire, which measures psychological distress 
experienced during the prior 2 weeks, was also incor -
porated into the Practical Approach to Care Kit (PACK) 
- Primary Care Guide for the Adult [13] — a clinical 
decision support tool for primary care workers. PACK includes guidelines for the assessment of traumatised 
or abused patients, and the MCR allows for healthcare 
workers to record the presence of abuse. However, even 
when provided with tools to detect psychological distress 
and experiences of domestic violence, few healthcare 
workers routinely screen pregnant women at clinic visits, 
citing discomfort with mental health issues and the lack 
of standardised referral pathways as the key barriers [14].
To assist the DoH, several models have been devel -
oped to provide screening and mental health care during 
the perinatal period in the Western Cape. The Perinatal 
Mental Health Project provides a successful screening 
and counselling service at one Midwife Obstetric Unit 
(MOU) in Cape Town [15]. The Africa Focus on Interven -
tion Research for Mental Health (AFFIRM) randomised 
controlled trial developed and evaluated a structured 
manualised task sharing counselling intervention for 
antenatal depression at two MOUs in Khayelitsha, Cape 
Town, in 2014–2016, delivered by community health 
workers (CHWs) [16]. The trial showed that there was a 
small but significant effect of the counselling intervention 
on psychological distress at 3 months postnatal, com -
pared to enhanced usual care (three supportive monthly 
phone calls) [3]. The effect became more significant at 
the 12 month postnatal assessment, suggesting that the 
counselling intervention has longer term benefits on 
managing depressive symptoms compared to the phone 
calls. Women in both intervention and control arms 
showed a substantial reduction in depression symptoms 
into the postnatal period. Following presentation of the 
preliminary AFFIRM trial results in January 2017, senior 
managers in the Western Cape DoH were supportive of 
scaling up a counselling service for antenatal depression 
in MOUs and basic antenatal care (BANC) clinics in the 
Cape Town metropolitan area.
To that end, the Health Systems Strengthening in sub-
Saharan Africa (ASSET) study sought to collaborate with 
the Western Cape DoH to select and evaluate a set of 
health systems strengthening (HSS) interventions aimed 
at improving the quality of care and clinical outcomes for 
perinatal women with CMDs and experiences of domes -
tic violence, attending public healthcare facilities in Cape 
Town. To help better understand how this study can be 
adapted for scale-up, we aim to assess the influence of the Discussion: This pilot implementation study will inform us about a range of implementation and clinical outcome 
measures that are relevant for assessing HSS interventions for perinatal women with depression, anxiety, or experi-
ences of domestic violence in low-resource settings. Lessons learnt from the pilot study will be incorporated into the 
design of a cluster randomised control trial for which further funding will be sought.

HSS interventions on important clinical and implemen -
tation outcomes such as feasibility, acceptability, fidel -
ity, and appropriateness throughout the implementation 
process.
Methods
This is a multi-phase study, consisting of a (1) pre-
implementation phase, (2) development phase, and (3) 
implementation phase. The first two phases of the study 
have already been completed, and the third phase is cur -
rently in progress with enrolment in the study not yet 
completed.
Implementation science
Implementation science determinant and evaluation 
frameworks were used throughout the study. At the end 
of the pre-implementation phase of the study, we used 
determinant frameworks to identify the barriers and/
or enablers that we may have missed that would further 
inform the selection of any additional HSS interventions 
[17]. Specifically, the Theoretical Domains Framework 
(TDF) [18] and the Context and Implementation of Com -
plex Interventions Framework (CICI) [19] were used to 
identify determinants that could potentially influence 
implementation efforts throughout the implementation 
process. The Effective Practice and Organisation of Care 
(EPOC) taxonomy of implementation strategies was used 
to select relevant HSS interventions [20]. The concep -
tual framework for implementation outcomes by Proc -
tor et al. [21] was used to select relevant implementation 
outcomes. The TIDieR checklist and ‘Getting messier 
with TIDieR’ template [22] were used to describe the 
HSS programme in its entirety.
Pre‑implementation phase
The pre-implementation phase [23] took place in four 
MOUs and in the ten non-profit organisations (NPOs) 
mandated to provide facility- and community-based sup -
port to patients attending those facilities. The MOUs 
were purposively selected by DoH managers to repre -
sent each of the four sub-districts in the Cape Metropoli -
tan health district in Cape Town. Supplementary file 1 
describes the study designs, setting, data collection tools, 
and participants involved in the pre-implementation 
phase of the study. In each facility, we undertook (i) a sit -
uation analysis, (ii) a cross-sectional survey among preg -
nant women attending the MOUs for their first antenatal 
visit, (iii) qualitative interviews with pregnant women 
experiencing psychological distress or experiences of 
domestic violence, and (iv) qualitative interviews with 
healthcare workers. These methods and findings have 
been published elsewhere [14].Development phase
The development phase involved (i) designing a HSS 
programme, (ii) selecting HSS interventions to sup -
port the delivery of the HSS programme and address 
the contextual barriers identified during the pre-
implementation phase, (iii) developing the processes 
and tools to deliver the HSS programme and evaluate 
the HSS interventions, and (iv) piloting the HSS pro -
gramme at one facility.
Designing the HSS programme
The design of the HSS programme was guided by a The -
ory of Change (ToC) workshop. ToC workshops are a 
participatory process whereby a group of stakeholders 
agree on the long-term outcome the programme would 
like to achieve and identify the short- and medium-term 
outcomes needed to achieve it. The outcomes are graphi -
cally presented in a causal framework together with the 
assumptions of what needs to take place to achieve the 
outcomes, the contextual factors which influence the 
outcomes, and the indicators needed to measure the 
achievement of the outcomes [24].
We facilitated a ToC workshop with approximately 40 
DoH managers and clinical staff working in various pro -
grammes within the four sub-districts in the Cape Met -
ropolitan health district. Following the presentation of 
the pre-implementation phase findings, workshop par -
ticipants discussed and agreed on the long-term outcome 
the programme aimed to achieve — improved coverage 
of maternal mental health services. Thereafter, partici -
pants worked in small groups to clarify what existed and 
to identify the short- and medium-term outcomes, as 
well as the actions and assumptions needed. Small group 
discussions were fed back and discussed in the bigger 
group. Group discussions and feedback sessions were 
recorded and used to guide the development of the ToC 
Diagram (Fig.  1). Several contextual barriers were iden -
tified including poor patient knowledge of both mental 
health disorders and domestic violence, high levels of 
stigma, poor mental health-seeking behaviour, and poor 
detection, referral, and treatment rates.
The ToC diagram guided the development of a process 
map (Fig.  2) to visually describe the processes and actions 
needed by healthcare workers to achieve the long-term 
outcome. Over a 3-month period, an iterative process 
of presenting the process map to various groups of sub-
district-, facility-, and community-level healthcare work -
ers and managers for feedback, adjustment, and approval 
was followed.
The approved HSS programme consisted of four main 
components — awareness raising, detection, referral, 
and treatment. To operationalise the HSS programme, 
Page 4 of 13 Abrahams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:100 
the following activities would be needed: (i) health pro -
motion officers would deliver health promotion and 
awareness talks to pregnant women, (ii) antenatal care (ANC) nurses would detect and refer pregnant women 
with CMDs and experiences of domestic violence, 
and (iii) CHWs would deliver a structured counselling Fig. 1 Theory of change diagram

programme to pregnant women with mild to moderate 
symptoms of CMDs.
Selecting the HSS interventions and implementation 
outcomes
Findings from the pre-implementation phase of the 
study were reviewed at an annual ASSET meeting [17]. 
The TDF [18] and the CICI framework [19] were used 
to identify contextual and behavioural determinants 
that could influence the implementation of HSS inter -
ventions and implementation outcomes that may have 
been missed in the ToC workshop. If there were deter -
minants not identified in the pre-implementation phase, 
these were accounted for at this stage. The HSS inter -
ventions that were selected in the ToC workshop were 
also labelled according to the EPOC taxonomy [18, 20]. 
Finally, we ensured that implementation outcomes were 
aligned with the selected HSS interventions. Table  1 pro -
vides an overview of the contextual barriers that were 
identified, the HSS interventions that were selected, and 
the implementation outcomes that will be assessed.
Developing a training model To ensure the sustainabil -
ity of the HSS programme, a cascaded training model 
(Supplementary file 2) was developed, whereby the 
ASSET team provided master training workshops at cen -
tralised locations. Three master training workshops were 
held with selected DoH staff members: (i) facility-based 
psychiatric nurses received a 1-day training on health 
promotion and awareness, (ii) facility PACK trainers 
received a 4-day training on detection and referral, and 
(iii) community-based services (CBS) trainers from each 
of the sub-districts (whose primary role was to provide 
on-going training to community-based healthcare work -
ers on a range of topics) and NPO managers from the 
supporting NPOs received a 4-day training on counsel -
ling and a 1-day training on supervision. Master train -
ers were tasked with providing training to small groups 
of facility- and community-based healthcare workers 
whose role would include implementing the selected HSS 
interventions.
Addressing poor patient knowledge and health‑seeking 
behaviour Training and health promotion were selected 
as the HSS interventions to address poor patient knowl -
edge of mental health and domestic violence, poor 
health-seeking behaviour, and the high levels of stigma 
among patients. The awareness raising component of 
the HSS programme will consist of health promotion 
officers or other lay healthcare workers providing daily, 
5–7-min talks to groups of pregnant women in waiting 
areas at facilities. Information to be covered during the 
talks will include the signs, symptoms, risk factors and consequences of depression, anxiety, and experiences 
of domestic violence as well as the treatment options 
available.
Facility-based psychiatric nurses who were the recipi -
ents of the master training will be tasked with providing 
cascaded training to health promotion officers or other 
lay healthcare workers at facilities. Master trainers will 
be provided with a Health Promotion and Awareness of 
Maternal Mental Health Training Manual [25] to guide 
the delivery of the training content. Healthcare workers 
who will be trained to implement the health promotion 
talks will be provided with an A3 size, colour flipchart to 
guide the delivery of the talk.
Addressing low levels of detection Training, delivery 
of individual-level care, and audit and feedback were 
selected as the HSS interventions to address the low lev -
els of detection. ANC nurses will be trained to screen all 
pregnant women for symptoms of CMDs and experi -
ences of domestic violence as part of routine care, using 
the mental health screening questionnaire [12] avail -
able in the MCR [11] and the PACK guidelines [26]. The 
training material was developed in conjunction with the 
Knowledge Translation Unit (KTU), a clinical research 
unit at the University of Cape Town, that led the develop -
ment of PACK. The PACK guide was used as the foun -
dation for the detection and referral process. A PACK 
Antenatal Women and Mental Health Module [27] was 
developed to strengthen the mental health component 
of routinely provided antenatal care. Four case studies 
formed the backbone of the module, complemented by 
HSS discussions, completion of relevant stationery, and a 
focus on effective communication strategies. PACK facil -
ity trainers were the recipients of the master training and 
will be tasked with training ANC nurses at their facilities. 
The cascaded training will consist of four, weekly, 2-hr 
training sessions.
During the implementation phase, audit and feedback 
will be used to assess the screening rates at facilities and 
provide feedback to the relevant ANC nurses and their 
managers at bi-monthly meetings.
Addressing poor linkage to care Referral systems, train -
ing and audit, and feedback were selected as the HSS 
interventions to address the poor linkage to care. Stand -
ardised referral pathways were developed. PACK facility 
trainers (facility-based healthcare workers who are PACK 
trained and assigned to deliver PACK training to health -
care workers in their own facility) were the recipients of 
the master training and will be tasked with training ANC 
nurses at their facilities. ANC nurses will be trained to

assess the severity of symptoms in pregnant women who 
screen positive and to use the standardised referral path -
ways to link them to care. Pregnant women with mild 
to moderate symptoms of depression will be referred to 
CHWs, while women with severe symptoms of depres -
sion will be referred to healthcare workers providing 
specialised care such as medical officers, psychiatric 
nurses, and psychologists. Pregnant women experiencing 
domestic violence will be referred to a social worker for 
support.
During the implementation phase, audit and feedback 
will be used to assess the referral rates at facilities and 
provide feedback to the relevant ANC nurses and their 
managers at bi-monthly meetings.
Addressing the limited availability of treatment Sev -
eral HSS interventions were selected to address the lim -
ited availability of treatment, including task-sharing, 
training, delivery of individual-level care, change to the 
healthcare environment, audit and feedback, and per -
formance monitoring. A task-sharing psychological 
counselling programme was developed, to be delivered 
by CHWs to pregnant women with mild to moderate 
symptoms of depression or anxiety. It consists of three, 
45-min, structured, individual-level counselling ses -
sions using problem-solving therapy, delivered weekly by 
CHWs, in patients’ homes [28]. The development of the 
psychological counselling programme was informed by a 
manual review of counselling interventions, semi-struc -
tured interviews with healthcare workers and pregnant 
women, and finally through several stakeholder engage -
ment meetings. CHWs will be supervised and supported 
by outreach team leaders (OTLs) to reinforce the coun -
selling skills, ensure fidelity to the psychological counsel -
ling, and manage difficult cases.
CBS trainers employed in each sub-district were selected 
as the recipients of the master training. Master trainers 
received a 4-day training workshop, where they were 
provided with a Counselling Skills for Community Health 
Workers [29] training manual and a Maternal Mental 
Health Counselling Support Guide to assist them in deliv -
ering cascaded training on (i) counselling and (ii) super -
vision and support. The cascaded counselling training 
will be delivered over 3 days to CHWs and OTLs and 
consist of five sections: (i) understanding depression, 
anxiety, and experiences of domestic violence; (ii) basic 
counselling skills; (iii) patient assessment; (iv) 3-ses -
sion counselling intervention; and (v) coping skills. The 
cascaded supervision and support training session will 
be delivered to OTLs during a 1-day training which 
will include (i) counselling support styles and skills and (ii) the use of individual and group support. CHWs and 
OTLs will be provided with a Reference Guide for Com ‑
munity Health Workers, in addition to the Counselling 
Skills for Community Health Workers training manual to 
support the delivery of the counselling intervention.
During the implementation phase, audit and feedback 
will be used to assess the counselling rates and provide 
feedback to the relevant CHWs, OTLs, and their manag -
ers at bi-monthly meetings. OTLs will also observe the 
delivery of the counselling sessions to monitor the per -
formance of the CHWs.
Pilot study
The intervention processes and tools were piloted at one 
of the pre-implementation phase MOUs. Lessons learnt 
and feedback received from healthcare workers involved 
in the pilot study were incorporated into the final design 
and used to develop a referral pathway diagram (Fig. 3).
Implementation phase
The implementation phase will be used to deliver the 
HSS interventions selected to improve awareness, detec -
tion, referral, and treatment of CMDs and experiences of 
domestic violence in perinatal women attending public 
healthcare facilities between April and December 2021. 
Both clinical outcomes and implementation outcomes 
will be assessed.
Setting and participants
Three healthcare facilities will be purposively selected. 
Study sites will include a combination of (i) MOUs and 
BANC clinics situated in low-resource settings, (ii) pro -
vide care to women of mixed ancestry and Black Afri -
can women, (iii) represent three of the four sub-districts 
within the Cape Metropolitan health district, and (iv) 
provide care to ≥60 pregnant women attending the 
facility for their first antenatal clinic appointment each 
month. All NPOs providing community-based support to 
the selected facilities will automatically be included.
The participants will include perinatal women attend -
ing the healthcare facilities, and sub-district-, facility-, 
and community-based healthcare workers. The following 
cadres of healthcare workers will be included: CBS train -
ers from each sub-district; PACK facility trainers based at 
each facility; psychiatric nurses, ANC nurses, and health 
promotion officers based at each facility; CHWs and 
OTLs employed by each NPOs supporting the selected 
facilities.

Study designs
The following study designs will be used to assess the 
implementation and clinical outcomes of the interven -
tion: (i) healthcare worker survey, (ii) patient survey, (iii) 
observation of health promotion talks, (iv) cohort study, 
(v) patient file reviews, (vi) documentation review, (vii) 
counselling competence, and (viii) qualitative assess -
ments. One fieldworker will be based at each of the three 
facilities and be responsible for all the data collection. 
Anticipated sample sizes are based on experience gained 
during the pre-implementation phase, as well as on the 
goal of assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the 
various HSS intervention components and related meas -
ures. Table  2 provides an overview of the study designs 
and objectives, data collection instruments, participants 
to be recruited, and the timing of data collection.
Healthcare worker survey All healthcare workers 
involved in the implementation of a HSS intervention 
will be asked to complete a self-administered survey 
questionnaire prior to receiving training. The question -
naire will be available in participants’ home language and 
take 30 to 45 min to complete. In the last month of the 
study, healthcare workers who were actively involved in 
the intervention will be asked to complete the same sur -
vey questionnaire. We expect the number of healthcare 
workers linked to each facility to differ but estimate that 
between 10 and 20 healthcare workers are linked to each of the MOUs and BANC clinics. We intend to approach 
all healthcare workers and anticipate that at least 70% 
(i.e. 7–10 healthcare workers per facility) will agree to 
participate in the survey. The survey will be used to eval -
uate whether delivering the various HSS interventions 
resulted in a change in healthcare workers’ mental health 
knowledge, attitudes towards persons with mental illness, 
their psycho-social well-being, and their quality of life.
Patient survey During the baseline data collection 
period (prior to delivering the HSS interventions), preg -
nant women awaiting their routine tests and consulta -
tions will be approached and asked to complete a self-
administered survey questionnaire, available in their 
home language. During the implementation phase, preg -
nant women who received the health promotion talk 
will be asked to complete the same survey questionnaire 
immediately after the talk has been delivered. The survey 
questionnaire will consist of a few demographic ques -
tions; questions about their knowledge of depression, 
anxiety, and domestic violence; questions on attitudes 
towards people with mental illness and experiences of 
domestic violence; and questions on their health-seeking 
behaviour. We anticipate that 15 to 30 pregnant women 
will be willing to complete the survey after a talk and plan 
on administering the survey daily during the 2 weeks of 
baseline data collection and at least once per week dur -
ing the implementation phase. The survey will be used to Fig. 3 Diagram of the referral pathway

assess the effect of the health promotion talks in chang -
ing the mental health knowledge, attitudes, and health-
seeking behaviour of perinatal women.
Observation of health promotion talks Fieldwork -
ers based at facilities will be tasked with observing the 
delivery of the health promotion talks and completing 
a checklist to assess (i) the extent to which the talks are 
adopted at facilities, (ii) whether the talks are being deliv -
ered as intended, and (iii) the extent to which the talks 
are accessed by the pregnant women.
Cohort study At baseline, pregnant women attending 
the clinic for their first antenatal visit will be screened by 
fieldworkers, in their home language, for the presence of 
CMDs and experiences of domestic violence. All women 
who screen positive — i.e. score ≥13 on the EPDS or ≥2 
on the bespoke violence screening tool — will be invited 
to participate in the cohort study. A random sample of 
33% of pregnant women who screen negative (identi -
fied by Redcap, using a randomisation table) will also be 
invited to participate in the cohort study. Fieldworkers 
will administer several questionnaires assessing risk fac -
tors for CMDs and the frequency of domestic violence. 
The presence of and risk factors for CMDs and experi -
ences of domestic violence in cohort participants will be 
assessed again at the 36-week gestation and the 6-week 
postnatal follow-up timepoints. Changes in clinical out -
comes and their risk factors will be assessed by compar -
ing the 36-week gestation and the 6-week postnatal out -
comes to the baseline outcomes.
The cohort study will be used (i) to assess the presence 
of and risk factors for CMDs and experiences of domes -
tic violence in pregnant women and (ii) to assess whether 
the HSS interventions resulted in improvement in clinical 
outcomes. It will be based on the proportion of women 
showing a clinically significant improvement as measured 
by the EPDS. Women with an EPDS score of ≥13 at base -
line will be classified as having symptoms of CMD. Clini -
cally significant improvement will be classified as having 
a 50% reduction in EPDS scores measured at the 36-week 
gestation and 6-week postnatal follow-up timepoints, 
compared to baseline. The study will also assess the fea -
sibility of administering these instruments and effectively 
following up perinatal women in these communities, for 
a potential future cRCT.
Sample size calculations were used to determine the 
number of participants needed for a cluster randomised 
control trial (cRCT). Based on a level of significance 
(alpha) = 0.05, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient 
(ICC) = 0.02, an effect size = 0.27, the correlation coefficient between baseline and follow-up (r) = 0.3–0.5, 
and power = 80–90%, 225–291 participants would be 
needed at each of the intervention and control facili -
ties in a cRCT. For this pilot study at three facilities, we 
intend to recruit 225–291 participants per facility. If we 
are able to recruit 20 perinatal women per week at each 
facility, we would need to spend at least 3 months doing 
recruitment.
Patient file reviews During the baseline data collection 
period and throughout the implementation phase, field -
workers will capture the outcome of the psychological 
distress questionnaire found in the MCRs of pregnant 
women attending healthcare facilities. The informa -
tion obtained will be used to assess whether delivering 
the HSS interventions improved (i) detection and refer -
ral rates, (ii) uptake of the detection and referral inter -
ventions, and (iii) the sustainability of the detection and 
referral interventions.
Documentation reviews Reviewing registers and referral 
forms will be used to assess the coverage of the detection, 
referral, and treatment interventions. Rates of detection 
and referral for women with CMDs and experiences of 
domestic violence will be assessed before the interven -
tion, and monitored weekly throughout the intervention 
period, by triangulating information obtained from (i) a 
review of the daily patient registers completed by ANC 
nurses and (ii) reviewing the referral forms completed by 
ANC nurses for patients who screen positive and agree to 
counselling.
The proportion of perinatal women with CMDs and 
experiences of domestic violence who take up the referral 
and receive partial or full treatment will be assessed by 
triangulating information obtained from reviewing the 
referral and counselling feedback forms to be completed 
by OTLs for all patients who are referred for the task-
sharing psychological counselling programme.
Counselling competence The counselling competence 
of the CHWs delivering the counselling intervention will 
be measured during their first three counselling sessions. 
OTLs will be tasked with completing a counselling ses -
sion evaluation form while observing the counselling 
sessions. The evaluation form will use a Likert scale and 
consist of questions assessing their verbal and non-verbal 
skills, as well as a checklist to evaluate the fidelity to the 
structured counselling format and content.
Qualitative assessments Key informant interviews and 
focus group discussions with perinatal women, ANC 
nurses, CHWs, and OTLs will be used to assess the 
Page 11 of 13
 Abrahams et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2022) 8:100 
 
acceptability, appropriateness, satisfaction, and feasibility 
of the various HSS interventions.
Ethical approval and consent to participate
Ethical approval for the study has been obtained from the 
Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of 
Cape Town as well as from the Psychiatry, Nursing and 
Midwifery Research Ethics Subcommittee at King’s Col -
lege London. In addition, the Western Cape Department 
of Health approved the use of the research sites. All par -
ticipants will be asked to provide written, informed con -
sent after the procedure is verbally explained to them. 
Participants will be informed of their right to withdraw 
from the study at any time without consequences. Preg -
nant women who are recruited into the cohort study 
will receive a ZAR100 food voucher after completing all 
questionnaires at recruitment and again at the 36-week 
follow-up interview.
Data handling and confidentiality
All data will be processed in accordance with the Gen -
eral Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR). Partici -
pants will be allocated a unique identifier, which will be 
used to maintain confidentiality and minimise the use of 
personal information. Questionnaires completed in hard 
copy will be stored in a locked room at the University of 
Cape Town. King’s College London will be the data con -
troller for the ASSET study.
Data analyses
A combination of mixed methods will be used to ana -
lyse the data collected. REDCap, a secure web platform 
for building and managing online databases and surveys, 
will be used to capture all quantitative data. Data will 
be exported to STATA/SE statistical software package 
version 15.1 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA) for 
analysis. Multiple imputation will be used to account for 
participants with incomplete data. Categorical variables 
will be described using frequency and percentages, and 
associations measured using chi-square tests. Continu -
ous variables will be described using means and standard 
deviations, and associations measured using t-tests. Lin -
ear regression models will be used to evaluate for change 
in EPDS scores, adjusting for the clinic and any potential 
confounders. Implementation outcomes will be evaluated 
using multivariable regression models that adjust for rel -
evant confounders and clinic.
Qualitative data will be analysed using NVivo 12 Pro 
qualitative data analysis software (QSR International Pty 
Ltd) [41]. Semi-structured interviews will be transcribed 
by bilingual speakers. Transcripts will be analysed using a 
thematic analysis approach to generate initial codes and define, search for, and review themes [42]. The develop -
ment of initial codes will be guided to a certain degree by 
the interview topic guides. Further themes not captured 
by the initial coding will be identified through extensive 
reading of the transcripts and coding passages inter -
preted as important.
Discussion
There is a substantial treatment gap for perinatal women 
with depression, anxiety, and exposure to domestic vio -
lence in low-resource African settings. We selected HSS 
interventions to improve awareness, detection, referral, 
and treatment of perinatal women experiencing symp -
toms of CMDs and domestic violence in Cape Town, 
South Africa. The purpose of this protocol is to describe 
how we will assess the effect of the HSS interventions on 
important implementation outcomes. The findings will 
help us refine the intervention components by identifying 
the barriers and facilitators experienced by the healthcare 
providers, their managers, and the patients receiving the 
intervention. While we aim to improve patient knowledge 
of domestic violence, and thereby improve their health-
seeking behaviour, we do not intend to manage active cases 
of domestic violence by engaging with the perpetrators.
The findings will also inform us about the feasibil -
ity and acceptability of a variety of implementation and 
clinical outcome measures in this context. Lessons learnt 
from the pilot study will be incorporated into the design 
of a cRCT for which further funding will be sought. The 
integration of detection, referral, and care for perinatal 
women with depression, anxiety, and exposure to domes -
tic violence into routine low-resource health facility and 
community settings is complex and requires a careful 
evaluation of process and outcomes, if it is to be scaled 
up for broader population benefit.
