Abstract
Background: A dementia diagnosis can prevent people from partic ipating in society, leading to a further decline in
cognitive, social and physical health. However, it may be possible for people with dementia to continue to live meaningful
lives and continue to participate actively in society if a support ive psychosocial environment exists. Resilience theory, which
focuses on strengthening personal attributes and external assets in the face of serious challenges, may provide a scaffold on
which an inclusive multifaceted psychosocial supportive environment can be built. This protocol paper describes a study to
determine the feasibility of conducting a mu ltifaceted complex resilience building p sychosocial intervention for people with
dementia and their caregivers living in the community.
Methods: This is a non-randomised feasibility st udy. Ten participants with dementia and their primary caregivers living in the
community will be recruited and receiv e the CREST intervention. The intervention provides (a) a 7-week cognitive
stimulation programme followed by an 8-week physical ex ercise programme for people with dementia and (b) a 6-week
educational programme for caregivers. Members of the wi der community will be invited to a dementia awareness
programme and GP practices to a dementia training worksho p. Trained professionals wil l deliver all intervention
components. Outcomes will assess the feasibility and acceptabilit y of all study processes. The feasi bility and acceptability of a
range of outcomes to be collected in a future definitive trial , including economic measurements, will also be explored.
Finally, social marketing will be used to map a route toward stigma change in dementia for use in a subsequent trial.
Quantitative feasibility outcome assess ments will be completed at baseline and after completion of the 15-week intervention
while qualitative data will be collec ted at recruitment, baseline, during and post-intervention delivery.

Background
Dementia is a progressive neurocognitive disorder [ 1]
characterised by memory and cognitive impairment as
well as behaviour changes, all of which impact on the
ability of the person with dementia to undertake activ-
ities of daily living [ 2]. It is estimated that there will be
152 million people with dementia worldwide in 2050 [ 2].
Therefore, dementia is a major contributor to the global
burden of disease with a yearly estimated cost of US$818
billion dollars [ 3], projected to rise to $2 trillion by 2030
[2,4–6]. Furthermore, almost 85% of costs are related to
family and social care costs [ 5]. It is not surprising there-
fore that dementia is considered one of the biggest
health, societal and economic challenges of the twenty-
first century [ 2,5–7].
A dementia diagnosis may also exacerbate social in-
equality and discrimination [ 8]. This diagnosis can lead
to marginalisation within the health services [ 9] and may
prevent people with dementia from participating in soci-
ety [ 8,10]. However, it may be possible for people with
dementia to continue to live a meaningful life, retain
many abilities and continue to actively participate in so-
ciety, if there is a supportive psychosocial environment
that maximises functioning and social connectedness [ 5,
11,12]. Resilience theory is promising as it focuses upon
strengthening people ’s resources in the face of serious
challenges and difficulties [ 13], and may, by enhancing
people ’s strengths and valued relationships, provide a
scaffold upon which an inclusive supportive psychosocial
environment can be built.
Resilience, defined as a “dynamic and amendable
process ”[14], encompasses positive adaptation within
the context of major adversity. It focuses on modifiable
intra-personal skills and protective factors aimed at
increasing a person ’s ability to remain psychologically,
socially and physically healthy, or ‘resilient ’, in the face
of adversity.
Windle [ 15] describes resilience as a ‘multilevel
construct ’and a dynamic lifetime process. She
presents a resilience framework that focuses on
individual, community and societal components that
impact the resilience of older people with dementia
and their caregivers. Similarly, Harris [ 16] recom-
mends that resilience-boosting interventions should
be multifaceted, targeting the individual, family andcommunity. She outlines that at the individual level,
resilience promoting factors include the person with
dementia accepting changes in self; an emphasis on
nurturing the person's remaining skills; focusing on
the positives and what is retained; recognising the
multiple ways in which a person with dementia can
make a meaningful contribution to family, friends
and/or the community. At the level of family and
community, resilience-promoting factors include hav-
ing a supportive doctor; having connections to mean-
ingful community groups and activities, and having a
supportive and positive social environment that pro-
motes dignity and respect and reasonable independ-
ence. Examining the assets a nd protective factors both
internal and external to the person with dementia is
considered central to effective resilience building in
people with dementia [ 13,14,17,18]. Many other
writers also endorse the position that psychosocial resili-
ence- building interventions need to be multi-faceted, fo-
cusing on both the personal attributes and external assets
of people with dementia [ 15,16,19–22].
However, what precisely the preferred components of a
multifaceted psychosocial resilience-building intervention
might be for people living with dementia is relatively un-
known. To address this deficit, we interviewed a sample of
people with mild-moderate dementia ( n=6 )[ 23], carers
(n=2 8 )[ 24] and 12 informal caregivers/care partners
[25]. Analysis of these interviews identified five areas of
importance to resilience building: having personal control
and a ‘fighting spirit ’, strong family relationships, staying
connected to communities, undertaking physical activity
and raising awareness and tackling negative attitudes
through dementia education.
It is clear from the interviews with people with demen-
tia, caregivers and the literature that psychosocial resili-
ence building interventions need to be multi-faceted,
focusing on both the personal attributes and external as-
sets of people with dementia. McDermott et al. [ 26] car-
ried out a systematic review of the effectiveness of a
wide range of psychosocial interventions to meet the
physical, cognitive, psychological and social needs of
people with dementia. The evidence drawn from 22 re-
views evaluating 197 studies indicated that both group
cognitive stimulation therapy and physical exercise have
recognisable benefits for people with dementia.Casey et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:177 Page 2 of 16
Utilising this evidence and drawing on the expertise of
the research team, we identified three successful psycho-
social interventions, namely, cognitive stimulation, phys-
ical exercise and education, which we hypothesised
could be combined to create a novel multifaceted psy-
chosocial resilience-building intervention simultaneously
targeting the personal attributes and external assets of
people with dementia.
Cognitive stimulation therapy
Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a non-
pharmacological psychosocial intervention aimed at
building both internal and external assets of people with
mild to moderate dementia [ 27]. It involves engaging the
person with dementia in a range of activities, typically
delivered in a group setting, aimed at improving cogni-
tive and social functioning [ 28]. Many studies reveal that
CST has a positive impact on cognitive functioning, and
quality of life of people with dementia [ 29,30] as well as
having positive outcomes on social interaction and com-
munication [ 29]. Furthermore, a Cochrane systematic re-
view on CST, which included 15 randomised controlled
trials with a total of 718 participants, found that people
with dementia receiving CST had significantly improved
cognition, communication and quality of life compared
to those receiving usual care or an alternative activity
[26,27]. CST is also recommended for people with mild
to moderate dementia [ 10,31]. CST therefore has the
potential to build the internal and external assets of
people with dementia.
Exercise
Physical exercise is important for cognition and brain
health because it impacts on other modifiable risks fac-
tors such as obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular and
metabolic risk factors [ 5]. Studies also indicate that exer-
cise may decrease inflammation and cholesterol and pro-
mote beneficial growth factors in the brain [ 32,33].
Although randomised trials have not yet demonstrated
that exercise delays cognitive decline or dementia, obser-
vational studies do demonstrate an inverse relationship
between exercise and risk of dementia [ 5]. In particular,
high-intensity multi-component exercises, including
walking, stretching and other strength exercises seemed
to be most beneficial [ 26]. Furthermore, group activities
and group exercise interventions with a strong social
element have been found to be beneficial and promote
social connectedness [ 26,34] and life satisfaction, and
reduce aggression and night-time restlessness [ 35,36].
Likewise, Junge et al. [ 37] in their systematic mixed
studies review exploring the effect and importance of
physical activity on behavioural and physiological symp-
toms of dementia found that of key importance was the‘socially rewarding ’aspect of the group-based physical
activities.
Dementia education
Dementia education for informal caregivers, health care
professionals and members of the public has been iden-
tified as key to enhancing the quality of life of people
with dementia [ 38].
Informal caregivers provide most of the care for
people with dementia living at home [ 39]. These care-
givers are therefore a crucial resource/external asset for
people with dementia. However, they are often unsup-
ported in their caregiving role, which may result in the
person with dementia being placed in residential care
prematurely [ 39]. Dickinson et al. [ 22] undertook a sys-
tematic review of 31 systematic reviews of psychosocial
interventions for informal caregivers of people with de-
mentia. They found that effective educational interven-
tions included presenting structured information about
dementia and caregiving issues, actively involving care-
givers, and delivering the educational programme in a
support group format. Other studies reveal that psycho-
social educational interventions which include informa-
tion on how dementia affects the brain, different types of
dementia, skills to effectively communicate with people
with dementia, how to manage behavioural symptoms,
as well as information on local resources have been
found to be effective in helping caregivers to more ef-
fectively work with, support and care for people with de-
mentia [ 40–42] and lead to more person- centered
attitudes, empathy and improved sense of competence.
Within the community, the general practitioner (GP)
is the first health care professional to be consulted when
dementia is suspected by the person themselves or by a
family member [ 43]. As outlined by Harris [ 16], a sup-
portive doctor is an important community level resili-
ence- building resource for people with dementia.
However, GPs acknowledge that the complexities associ-
ated with the diagnosis and management of dementia is
challenging and recognise a need for further education
and training [ 44]. Providing educational support to GP ’s,
in particular interactive small group work [ 45], may
enable them to provide optimal care and promote
resilience in people with dementia.
Finally, the broader community and members of the
public are key resilience promoting factors for people
with dementia, influencing the extent to which the per-
son with dementia can continually function and remain
in their own environment [ 38]. However, a lack of un-
derstanding of dementia can lead to fear and stigmatisa-
tion, which contributes to the social isolation of people
with dementia [ 46]. Dementia awareness raising inter-
ventions can help combat stigma by tackling public
perceptions [ 47]. In particular, public education isCasey et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:177 Page 3 of 16
considered a key strategy in reducing the stigma associ-
ated with dementia [ 9,46–55]. The focus is on reducing
the knowledge gap [ 9] and replacing myths with accur-
ate information [ 9,49,50,54]. Social contact in particu-
lar is considered the most effective way of reducing
stigma and improving attitudes toward dementia [ 56]a s
it reduces anxiety about contact and promotes empathy
[53]. To be effective, this social contact ideally needs to
be targeted, local, credible and sustainable [ 57], thereby
building the external assets of people with dementia. En-
hancing and extending the social networks of the person
with dementia creates new connections and strengthens
relationships [ 58], thereby building their external re-
sources/assets.
In summary, psychosocial interventions utilising either
CST, or physical exercise or education have the capacity
to strengthen either personal attributes or external assets
of people with dementia. However, multifaceted psycho-
social interventions are required to build resilience,
which simultaneously target the personal and external
assets of people with dementia. We therefore combined
CST, exercise and education to create a novel, multifa-
ceted, psychosocial resilience building intervention for
use in a future definitive RCT.

Intervention
The CREST intervention is a multi-level complex psy-
chosocial intervention of 15 weeks duration. It consists
of three key interrelated components targeted at people
with dementia: their informal caregivers, GPs and the
wider community. CREST consists of three components,
cognitive stimulation therapy, physical exercise and de-
mentia education. An overview of the intervention com-
ponents, their duration, content, number and targeted
participants is presented in Fig. 2.
1)Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST)
In this feasibility study, the ‘Making a difference ’CST
programme developed by Spector et al. [ 12] will be used.
This programme consists of 14 sessions delivered over
the first 7 weeks of the intervention. In CREST, partici-
pants with dementia will attend two 1 h sessions per
week and each session will include approximately five
participants. Sessions will include a focus on the use of
reminiscence and providing triggers to aid recall, stimu-
lating language and executive functioning and being
person-centred.
A health care professional trained to deliver the
programme using the CST manual and supported by a
co-facilitator will facilitate each session. The role of theCasey et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:177 Page 4 of 16
co-facilitator will be to help set up the class and support,
prompt and encourage participants to adhere to the
programme.
2)Physical exercise programme
An exercise programme, based on the PRINCE struc-
tured exercise programme [ 60] modified to meet the
needs of people with dementia, will be used. This exer-
cise programme, delivered over 8 weeks (after the CST
programme), is a total of 12 h in duration: 1 h session a
week for 4 weeks and 2 h sessions a week for 4 weeks
(see Fig. 2). The programme is designed to be delivered
in a group class and consists of a combination of aerobic
and strength training exercises appropriate for people
with dementia and education content specific to exercis-
ing. A physical exercise specialist supported by an exer-
cise manual will facilitate the programme. Older adults
from the community will support participants with de-
mentia to undertake the exercises. The older adults will
be invited to assist in the exercise sessions if they are:
/C15> 60 years of age
/C15Living in the community
/C15Do not have a diagnosis of dementia
/C15Willing and capable of undertaking the exercise
programme/C15Willing to support people with dementia to
undertake the exercise programme
/C15Able to speak in and read English
/C15Able to give informed consent
These older adults, who form part of the intervention,
will assist people with dementia by prompting them
through their exercises and providing support, encour-
agement as well as social interaction and engagement.
They will also assist people with dementia to record and
track their exercise progress.
The exercise specialist will assess the progress, dur-
ation and intensity of the programme for people with
dementia throughout the intervention, in order to in-
crease participants ’exercise capacity gradually. In week
1, participants with dementia will be asked to identify
specific exercise-related goals they wish to achieve by
the end of the programme. These will be reviewed in
weeks 4 and 8. The exercise programme will begin with
10 × 3-min circuits. Participants with dementia will start
at a station and rotate to the next station until all 10 cir-
cuits are completed. Each person with dementia will
undertake the exercise at each station 8 –10 times with
three repetitions. At the end of 3 min, the person will
record their exercises and move to the next station. In
week 3, the exercise specialist will assess participants
and prescribe weights for strengthening. Participants willFig. 1 Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments as per SPIRIT 2013Casey et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:177 Page 5 of 16
be encouraged to complete some of the exercises at
home and record these in a home exercise diary. In
addition, each person with dementia will be asked to
wear a Fitbit wearable activity tracker to measure
changes in exercise activity and sleep quality before, dur-
ing and after the physical exercise programme. Re-
searchers will assist participants to set up their Fitbit
and how to access their exercise performance on the
tracker. The feasibility and acceptability of wearing this
device as well as the extent to which the Fitbit acted as
an exercise motivational tool will be captured via quali-
tative interviews.
3)Dementia education programme
This programme consists of three elements:
(a) Community dementia awareness programme
This programme is targeted at members of the public
in the wider community. It is designed to provide infor-
mation on dementia, create positive action for dementia
and tackle negative attitudes toward dementia. This
programme, based on the Irish Health ServiceExecutive ’s[61]Dementia: Understand Together cam-
paign will be 1 h in duration. It will be delivered and co-
facilitated by dementia champions trained to deliver the
programme. The programme will include information
about dementia prevalence and impact, signs and symp-
toms, risk factors, and stigma and explores how commu-
nities can support the health and well-being of a person
with dementia and their family.
(b) Caregiver programme
This interactive and participatory 10-h (1 h 40 min a
week) educational programme will be delivered over the
first 6 weeks (coinciding with the CST programme) (Fig.
2). It will be facilitated by members of the research team
with expertise in dementia, nursing and education. This
programme is based on the DARES structured education
programme [ 62] modified to meet the needs of informal
caregivers of people with dementia and informed by The
Alzheimer Society of Ireland ’s Family Carer Training
programme [ 63]. The aim of this programme is to de-
velop the caregivers ’knowledge and skills regarding de-
mentia to enable them to respond more confidently to
the needs of the person with dementia, provide them

with ‘me time ’and an opportunity to focus on their own
health needs and to meet other caregivers and share ex-
periences. An overview of the content of the programme
is outlined in Fig. 2.
(c) GP educational workshop
This workshop was developed by the PREPARED team
(Primary Care Education, Pathways and Research of Demen-
tia) http://dementiapathways.ie /_filecache/d43/336/634-gp-
facilitator-workshop-guide.pdf .T h i se v i d e n c e - b a s e d1 . 5 - h
interactive, Continuous Professional Development (CPD)-
accredited dementia workshop aims to support GPs and pri-
mary care teams in their delivery of integrated dementia care.
Developed following an educational needs analysis, the work-
shop focuses on dementia diagn osis, post-diagnostic care
and management of the behavioural and psychological symp-
toms of dementia. The peer-facilitated workshop will be
delivered by a GP trained to deliver the programme.
Control group
This will be a single arm feasibility study and will not
have a comparison group.
Feasibility study outcomes
Given the aim of the study, outcomes focus on feasibility
and include:
1. Number of participants (people with dementia and
caregivers) who are screened, judged eligible and
agree to take part in the study.
2. Identification of optimal strategy for recruitment of
participants for future definitive trial.
3. Identification of barriers and enablers to stigma
change in dementia.
4. Willingness of key gatekeepers, for example, GPs
Local Alzheimer Cafés and Western Alzheimer
groups, to recruit participants (people with
dementia and caregivers).
5. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention
content, delivery and fidelity assessments.
6. Follow-up rates, outcome completion and
adherence/compliance rates.
7. Reasons for non-recruitment, non-adherence or
attrition.
8. Acceptability of the recruitment process,
assessments, data collection tools, intervention
content and delivery to participants.
9. Baseline score and variability of secondary outcome
measures among participants to inform sample size
estimates for a future definitive trial.
10. Evaluation of cost analyses process.Embedded qualitative study
Design
A qualitative descriptive approach based on the work of
Sandelowski [ 64] will be used to capture key stake-
holders views as to the acceptability and feasibility of re-
spective study procedures, including the recruitment
process, intervention content and delivery, data collec-
tion methods, as well as on the factors that facilitated or
hindered engagement and adherence. This data will help
identify any feasibility issues, which may need to be
addressed to inform the design of a subsequent RCT.
A sample of participants with dementia ( n= 5) and
caregivers ( n= 5) will be interviewed during the delivery
of the CST programme and caregiver programme re-
spectively (weeks 4 –5). In addition, a sample of partici-
pants with dementia ( n= 5) will be interviewed during
the delivery of the physical exercise programme (weeks
11-12). These interviews will focus on capturing the on-
going perceptions and experiences of participants as they
progress through the intervention. All participants will
be interviewed post-intervention. Interviewing some
participants during and post- intervention will provide
information as to how the intervention is progressing
and why things may have changed over time as they
progressed through the intervention.
The CORTE interviewing framework developed to
maximise the meaningful involvement of people with de-
mentia will be used [ 65]. This guide consists of gaining
COnsent, maximizing Responses, Telling the story, and
Ending on a positive note. All facilitators/co-facilitators
(n=9) as well as the older adults ( n= 10) supporting the
delivery of the exercise component will also be inter-
viewed to capture their experiences of delivering and fa-
cilitating the intervention and identify any potential
areas for improvement. In total, 54 interviews will be
undertaken. Table 1presents a summary overview of
participants who will be interviewed, and the time point
for these interviews.
Main trial outcome measurements
Although this is a feasibility study, we will explore the
feasibility and acceptability of a range of secondary out-
come measurement tools for use in a future definitive
trial. A summary of these measures and the participant
from which the outcome will be collected and recorded
is presented in Table 2, while Table 3presents a sum-
mary overview of how the pilot may inform a future
definitive trial.
Adverse events
In this study, the definition of an adverse event will be
similar to that used in the PRINCE study, i.e. ‘Any acute
alteration in the patient ’s physiological condition ’[86]. It
is not anticipated that participants will be at risk ofCasey et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies           (2020) 6:177 Page 7 of 16
experiencing an adverse event, and participants with demen-
t i aw i l lb er e q u i r e dt oc o n f i rm that their GP has been in-
formed and given them permi ssion to participate in the
study. Furthermore, the physical exercise programme will be
individualised and tailored t o each individual participant
based on an exercise assessment undertaken by the physical
exercise specialist and his/he r ongoing weekly monitoring of
participants. However, in the unlikely event that an adverse
event occurs, this will be recorded by facilitators or members
of the research team on an Adverse Event Reporting Form
and reported to the participant ’s GP, as all clinical responsi-
bility rests with those providing routine clinical care.
Health economic analysis
A preliminary health economic assessment of the intervention
will be undertaken. The health care resources consumed will
reflect the costs of organising and operating the intervention.
These costs will reflect the time input of health professionals
and fixed or overhead costs, in cluding any new equipment,
training, and capital expenditure related to the intervention.
The feasibility and acceptabilit y of collecting data on partici-
pants ’attendance at their general practice, hospital admissions
attendances (both outpatient clinic and emergency room
visits) and drug prescriptions as well as any personal expenses
incurred in relation to the intervention will also be explored.
Economic data will be collected for the month prior to the
commencement of the intervention (baseline data) and then
during the 15 weeks of the intervention. Exploring the feasi-
bility and acceptability of collecting economic data and the
appropriateness of the data collection instruments will inform
the design of the economic component of any future trial.
Social marketing
Social marketing will be used in this study to generate a
better understanding of the dynamics at work in relation
to stigma and dementia at community level and to map
out a route toward stigma change and promote positive
action for dementia. Social marketing seeks to develop
and integrate marketing concepts with other methods toencourage behaviour change for the benefit of individuals
and communities for the greater social good [ 87]. This
process will begin by identifying the barriers and enablers
to stigma change from the literature as well as also elicit-
ing the views of people with dementia and caregivers re-
garding the barriers and enablers for stigma change. The
data generated from this analysis will then be categorised
and rank ordered by a multidisciplinary core modelling
group led by a social marketing expert, to generate a sys-
tems map which will model visually any blockages and/or
underlying dynamics that affect stigma change in relation
to dementia, at a community level. The systems map will
also be informed by the quantitative data from the SIS
and DAS secondary measurement tools (Table 2). The
final stage will involve a focus group interview with local
key dementia experts to capture their perspectives and in-
put into the systems map. This will result in the refine-
ment of the map and the identification of leverage points
to promote stigma change and help highlight where the
focus should be in any subsequent study in relation to
promoting stigma change for dementia.
Sample size
As this is a non-randomised feasibility study, a formal
sample size calculation is not required [ 88]. The aim is
to recruit a purposive sample of 10 people with mild to
moderate dementia and their primary caregivers ( n= 10)
(20 participants in total), who meet the inclusion criteria,
to participate in the CREST intervention. The flow of
participants through the study is presented in Fig. 3.
Recruitment
The initial recruitment plan involved creating a list of GP
practices from the HRB Prim ary Care CTNI within (i) a
30-km radius of the city centre, (ii) having a population of
not less than 2500 and (iii) having at least one whole time
equivalent practice nurse. These practices were then con-
tacted and invited to respond to an expression of interest
regarding participating in the pilot study and to beTable 1 Overview of the qualitative data collection process

People with dementia: Data collected at baseline and post 15-week intervention
Quality of Life-Alzheimer ’s Disease (QoL-AD) [66]. The QoL-AD is a brief, 13-item measure designed specifically to obtain a rating of the person ’s
quality of life from either the person living with dementia and/or the caregiver [ 66]. For people with dementia, the questionnaire is completed dur-
ing an interview that usually takes 10 –15 min. The QoL-AD has very good psychometric properties and can be completed with people with a wide
range of severity of dementia [ 67]. Internal consistency is good with a Cronbach ’s alpha coefficient of 0.82 [ 67]. The scale has good content validity,
and it also correlates well with the Dementia Quality of Life scale (0.69) and with the Euroqol-5D scale (0.54), indicating good criterion concurrent
validity [ 67].
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [68]. The MMSE consists of questions covering 11 domains. It is a simplified, scored form of the
cognitive mental status examination, which assesses the cognitive aspects of mental functions.
The Geriatric Depression Scale –Short Form (GDS-15) [69]. This is a 15-item self-completed questionnaire or administered interview used to
measure depression in older adults and takes 5 –7 min to complete. Mitchell et al. [ 70] completed a meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy, clin-
ical utility and added value of the GDS in primary care. They concluded that the GDS-15 has acceptable sensitivity and specificity (81.3 and 78.4%,
respectively), “good ”clinical utility for screening and should be used in the diagnosis of late-life depression in primary care.
Stigma Impact Scale (SIS) [71]. The SIS has 24 items and is completed by people with dementia to measure the perceived stigma inherent in
progressive neurological diseases. The SIS can be administered via interview or self-completed and on average takes 10 min to complete. The in-
ternal consistency has a Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.89, indicating good reliability [ 71]. Construct validity scores range from 0.44 to 0.84 [ 71].
Positive Psychology Outcome Measure (PPOM) [72]. The PPOM is used to measure hope and resilience in people with dementia. It consists of
16 items designed for either self-completion by participants or completion via an interview and takes 5 –10 min to complete. The internal
consistency has a Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.94, indicating excellent reliability [ 72]. The PPOM remained moderately stable over a 1 week period (ICC:
880), and factor analyses indicated a two-factor structure solution with acceptable fit indices [ 72]. The PPOM was developed from the Resilience
Scale of Wagnild and Young [ 73], an instrument which scored highly in Windle et al. [ 74] review as a good measure of resilience.
EQ-5D-5L [75]. The EQ-5D-5L is a 6-item standardized questionnaire that measures self-reported generic health status. The scoring system trans-
lates the quality of life scores into an economic value. Domain responses and utility scores have good test-retest reliability (ICC, 0.777; agreemen t,
76.4 –98.1%) [ 76]. Scores of domains of the EQ-5D-5L correlated significantly ( r, 0.57 –0.74) with the scores of the SRS-22r domains, supporting con-
struct validity [ 76].
Fitbit The Fitbit will allow participants ’sleep patterns and exercise activity to be monitored. Each Fitbit will be synced to a mobile device or PC.
The Fitabase data management platform will be used to extract and aggregate participant data to facilitate analysis.
Caregivers: Data collected at baseline and post 15-week intervention
Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) [77]. The ZBI is a 22-item self-completed questionnaire or administered interview used to assess the level of burden
experienced by the primary caregivers of older people with dementia and people with disabilities. The ZBI takes on average 10 minutes to
complete. It is a valid and reliable instrument with a Cronbach ’s alpha value of 0.93; intra-class correlation coefficient for the test-retest reliability of
0.89 ( n= 149) [ 78].
Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire (SSCQ )[79]. The SSCQ is a 7-item self-completed questionnaire or administered interview, which
measures the sense of competence the caregiver of a person with dementia has. The SSCQ takes on average 5 min to complete. It is a valid and
reliable instrument with a Cronbach ’s alpha value of 0.76 [ 79].
Dementia Knowledge 20 (DK-20) [80]. The DK-20 is a 20-item self-administered questionnaire, which measures the knowledge people have re-
garding dementia. It is a 20-item self-administered questionnaire that takes on average 15 min to complete. Convergent validity reveals significan t
correlation between the DK-20 scale and the ADQ calculated using Spearman ’s one-tailed test, r(175) = 0.36, p< 0.001 [ 80]. Test-retest reliability for
the total scale is ICC = 0.73, p< 0.001, which indicated substantial reliability of the scale [ 80].
Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite (RUD-Lite) [81]. The RUD-lite questionnaire consists of 25 items, and measures healthcare resource
utilization among older adults with dementia and their caregivers, and time spent on formal and informal care by caregivers. The questionnaire is
completed by the primary caregiver of the person with dementia and takes on average 15 minutes to complete. Wimo et al. [ 82] found the estima-
tions provided by primary caregivers completing the RUD-lite to be accurate. The agreement between diaries and recall estimates was high for
personal ADL (intra-class correlation (ICC) 0.93), supervision (ICC 0.87) and total time (ICC 0.91) and lower but acceptable for instrumental ADL (I CC
0.75) [ 82].
Adult carer quality of life (AC-QoL) [83]. The AC-QoL is a 40-item questionnaire, which measures the overall quality of life of adult caregivers over
8 domains: support for caring, caring choice, caring stress, money matters, personal growth, sense of value, ability to care, and caregiver satisfac -
tion. The questionnaire takes 10 minutes to complete. Construct validity using exploratory factor analysis was conducted by Negri et al. [ 84] using
the Kaiser –Meyer –Olkin (KMO) measure with a total score of 0.90, and all KMO values for single items were higher than 0.70, thus above the ac-
ceptability limit of 0.50 [ 84]. Cronbach alpha scores for the eight subscales range from 0.79 to 0.90, showing acceptable to excellent levels of reli-
ability; alpha coefficient for the AC-QoL summed score was also excellent (0.93) [ 84].
Older people: Data collected at baseline and post 15-week intervention
Dementia Attitudes Scale (DAS) [85]. The dementia attitude ’s scale is a 20-item questionnaire that measures attitudes towards dementia of mem-
bers of the public, working professionals, and students. The DAS measures attitudes towards dementia of members of the public, working profes-
sionals, and students. DAS correlates significantly with scales that measure ageism and attitudes toward disabilities and has a Cronbach ’s alphas
ranging from 0.83 to 0.85 [ 85].

contacted by a member of the re search team. The latter in-
clusion criteria (ii and iii) were based on the optimal re-
cruitment strategies used in the PRINCE study [ 60].
GP practices expressing an interest in taking part were
asked to contact potential participants with dementia and
their primary caregiver (i) informing them of the study,
(ii) seeking their consent to participate and (iii) including
consent to be contacted by a member of the research
team. Participants willing to participate were then to be
invited to meet the research team, where consent would
be reconfirmed, and participants screened to confirm eli-
gibility and baseline and feasibility data collected using the
tools outlined in Table 2. Over a 10-week period, this re-
cruitment strategy yielded only two GP practices out of 14
eligible practices. After another 8-week period, these prac-
tices were able to identify 17 participants with dementia
who were eligible to participate and consented to be con-
tacted by the research team. Of these, five participants
with dementia and their caregivers consented to partici-
pate. However, two people with dementia and their care-
givers subsequently withdrew, and the remaining six
participants (three people with dementia and their care-
givers) were retained within the study but an alternative
recruitment strategy was then devised as outlined below.
The revised recruitment strategy involves contacting the
gatekeepers of local dementia advocacy and health care
organisations to identify any potential people with demen-
tia and their caregivers who might be interested in partici-
pating in the CREST study. This will include The
Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Western Alzheimer ’sa n d
HSE carer ’s organisations. The same steps used when
recruiting the GP ’s will be implemented (i) informing po-
tential participants about the study, (ii) seeking their con-
sent to participate and (iii) including consent to be
contacted by a member of the research team. Participants
willing to participate will then be invited to meet the re-
search team, where consent will be reconfirmed, including
permission to contact the participants GP to confirm their
eligibility to participate. Baseline and feasibility data will
then be collected using the tools outlined in Table 2.Older adults ( n= 10) in the community will be re-
cruited to support the physical exercise element of the
intervention using a variety of recruitment methods.
These will include, for example, information posters in
GP practices, pharmacies, active ageing/retirement
groups, older people organisations and support charities,
for example, Enable Ireland and St. Vincent de Paul.
Informed consent will be obtained from all participants
in the study and process consent, which enables partici-
pants to have a collaborative role in the decisions regard-
ing their ongoing participation [ 89], will be utilised
throughout. Older adults, people with dementia and care-
givers will all receive €20 toward travel expenses to facili-
tate meeting the researchers during recruitment, at each
data collection point in the study, as well as when attend-
ing each respective session of the intervention.
Criterion for progression to a definitive randomised
controlled trial
Decision-making about progression to a future definitive
randomised controlled trial will be based on achieving
the criteria for each of the study feasibility outcomes
which are outlined in Table 4.
Data management
The data management process will comply with the
General Data Protection Regulation [ 90] requirements.
All participants will be assigned a study number. The
master list of participants ’names with numeric identi-
fiers will be stored securely away from all other data in a
locked filing cabinet with access available only to the
members of the research team. All personal data stored
on a computer will also be encrypted and password-
protected in accordance with the General Data Protec-
tion Regulation (GDPR) and NUI Galway policies and
procedures. Data preparation and cleaning will be con-
ducted prior to data analysis, and any potential identi-
fiers in the qualitative transcripts, e.g. use of names
during interview, will be removed. Scores for the ques-
tionnaires will be double-checked by two researchers toTable 3 Summary overview of how the pilot may inform a future definitive trial

confirm accuracy prior to data entry. Two researchers
will also complete a visual record check of the inputted
data.
Data analysis
Quantitative analysis
All the study questionnaires will be inputted into the SPSS
data builder to create a project database. The data can be
exported to the software platform (e.g. R (3.5.2) or SPSS
(V 26.0) for data cleaning and analysis. Suitable numerical
and graphical summaries will be generated for demo-
graphic characteristics of the participants (e.g. percent-
ages, measure of central tendency (means or medians),
measures of variation (standard deviations or ranges).
Statistical analyses appropriate for modelling changes
score (e.g. ANCOVA and linear mixed models) will be
carried out to estimate changes in the outcome measuresfrom baseline to follow-up. All analyses will adhere to
statistical best practice and reproducibility principles.
Qualitative analysis
Interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim,
and all participants will be assigned a unique study iden-
tifier. Directed qualitative content analysis, based on the
work of Hsieh and Shannon [ 90], will be used to analyse
the data, whereby initial coding starts with a theory or
relevant research findings. Researchers will then im-
merse themselves in the data and allow themes to
emerge. Initially, each transcript will be read and then
open-coded. Each code will be examined and similar
codes will be broken down to form categories that are
more inclusive. This will lead to a hierarchical structure
of categories and subcategories. The final categories will
then be arranged into groups ([ 90], p.1279) that best

describe the data. The computer software package
NVivo (QSR International Pty Ltd., Version 12, 2018)
which will be used to facilitate the analysis and strategies
to enhance rigour as outlined by Lincoln & Guba [ 91]
will be put in place. The findings from the qualitative
data will be used to improve the intervention and all
study procedures and will inform the decision-making in
relation to progressing to any future trial.
Fidelity
Treatment fidelity assessment procedures (quality control
of the staff and intervention) will be piloted to provide in-
formation on the feasibility of i ntervention implementation,
as well as acceptability and usef ulness of treatment fidelity
assessment procedures. To maximise treatment fidelity, fa-
cilitators/co-facilitators delivering intervention components
will be required to complete an adherence to intervention
delivery form after the delivery of the components of the
intervention. Participants will also be asked to complete an
adherence form. An action plan will be drawn up and
implemented if a component is not being delivered to the
required standard.
Trial management
A steering group will be established and will consist of
key experts including dementia experts, an exercise spe-
cialist, psychologists, a trialist, a statistician, a GP, and
educationalists. They will provide overall supervision of
the trial and help ensure that the trial is conducted
rigorously. They will also comment on and approve pro-
ject documents, research approaches, and findings. In
addition, they will review any adverse reports.
Public and patient involvement (PPI)
Public and patient involvement (PPI) can be described
along a spectrum from no involvement (traditional way
research has been undertaken) to full partnership. We
will establish a Dementia Advisory Forum consisting of
people with dementia, caregivers and representatives
from various other key stakeholder groups including the
Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Western Alzheimers and
the HSE carers groups. This advisory forum will be
asked for input and advice in reviewing and providing
guidance on, for example, study plans, intervention com-
ponents, content and timing of delivery, data collection
methods, interview guides and study results. This will
help ensure that the voices and perspectives of targeted
end users are heard and are incorporated into the study.
PPI involvement will help us to address any issues
directly that affect participants, will improve study docu-
ments and materials, and will support the dissemination
and sharing of achievements in ways that promote acces-
sibility to people with dementia living in the community
and their caregivers.Ethics
Ethical approval has been obtained from the University
Research Ethics committee (Ref: 16-Feb-03; Amend
1907, approval, August 1st2019). In addition, the univer-
sity data protection officer has confirmed that the study
materials and plans meet the new EU General Data Pro-
tection Regulation [ 92]. We will also comply with simple
and clear communication guidelines as recommended by
the National Adult Literacy Agency [ 93] and the HSE
[94]. An ethical protocol will also be put in place to en-
sure that participants ’involvement is managed sensi-
tively and without causing upset. In the event of
modifications to the protocol, the trial register and the
ethics committee will be informed and updates will be
made.
Discussion
Living well with dementia requires the implementation
of multifaceted psychosocial resilience- building solu-
tions so that people with dementia can live well for lon-
ger within their own communities. This non-randomised
feasibility study will determine the feasibility of such an
intervention. The results will be disseminated in peer-
reviewed journals and at national and international con-
ferences and will be used to inform the development
and implementation of a subsequent RCT, should the
findings support feasibility.
Study status
Recruitment commenced 21 February 2019 and will end
on 14 October 2019.
